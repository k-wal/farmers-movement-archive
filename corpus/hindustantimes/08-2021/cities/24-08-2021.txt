We told them clearly that illegal constructions would not be allowed and with the help of a large police team, carried out the drive. We will also take action against property dealers,” he said.Bhath also said that they have started taking action against violators at the early stage of construction to ensure minimal losses to buyers.DTCP officials said that two earthmoving machines were pressed into service for the drives. “Road network and boundary walls were demolished in these colonies. One structure, which appeared to be an office of property dealers, was also demolished. We have also asked people not to invest in such illegal colonies,” said Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner (enforcement).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/three-illegal-under-construction-colonies-demolished-on-gurugram-outskirts-101629829744546.html

24-08-2021||Gurugram||MCG allows diesel, CNG autos to ply in electric zone||A week after the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) decided to allow only electric three-wheelers in a dedicated zone inaugurated on August 16, the civic body on Tuesday said that diesel and CNG autorickshaws will not be barred from plying in the zone.MCG launched an electric three-wheeler zone (ETWZ), covering Cyber City, Golf Course Road, DLF Phases 1, 2, 3 and 4, DLF-5, and the Mall Mile, allowing only e-rickshaws and e-autorickshaws to operate in these areas, while autorickshaws running on compressed natural gas (CNG) and diesel were barred.However, following several protests by drivers of diesel and CNG autorickshaws, including one on Tuesday at the Leisure Valley Park, the MCG issued a clarification stating that the main objective of the e-zone project was to convert old diesel autorickshaws into e-three wheelers.“Normal autos, including diesel and CNG powered autos, have not been stopped from plying in the e-three wheeler zone. It has been made mandatory for such auto drivers to carry other relevant documents, including fitness certificates, with them,” Mukesh Kumar Ahuja, the MCG commissioner, said in the civic body’s official release.However, Ahuja, in the release, said that diesel autorickshaws that are older than 10 years will not be allowed to operate, as per the current norms.While launching the ETWZ project, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had said that diesel and CNG autorickshaws will not be allowed to ply in the zone. Later that day, while describing the ETWZ, an official release issued by the district administration also stated that CNG and diesel autorickshaws are barred in the zone.The MCG commissioner could not be reached for comment in this regard.A senior MCG official privy to the matter said that the confusion, miscommunication, heavy protests led to the civic body backtracking on its decision.“Since April, autorickshaw union leaders, diesel autorickshaw drivers, and owners were regularly apprised about phasing out diesel vehicles with e-three wheelers. Due to a miscommunication, CNG autorickshaws were inadvertently added to the list. This mistake created distrust among the autorickshaw drivers, their unions and the MCG, as a result of which things got out of hand rapidly. We, hence, had to backtrack on the entire project,” said the official, not wishing to be named.Members of autorickshaw unions expressed relief over the MCG’s decision to allow CNG and diesel autorickshaws. On Tuesday, thousands of CNG and diesel autorickshaw drivers and union members held a meeting at the Leisure Valley Park in Sector 29, where they decided to stage another protest in the evening if their demands were not met.“The MCG has issued a completely contradictory statement and has gone back on their statement due to the protests. Regardless, the development is a massive relief for all autorickshaw drivers and owners as the e-zone project had affected their daily earnings massively. We will now be returning to business as usual,” said Yogesh Sharma, state general secretary, Haryana Auto Chalak Sanghatan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-allows-diesel-cng-autos-to-ply-in-electric-zone-101629829705369.html
24-08-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram murder spree: Hard to believe suspect killed four, say neighbours||Neighbours of a 59-year-old retired army subedar, who allegedly murdered his daughter-in-law and three tenants over suspicions of an illicit relationship, said that they are shocked by the incident. A neighbour who did not wish to be quoted said that the accused, Rao Rai Singh, while exiting the building in the morning told them that he killed the children as there was no one to take care of them. He allegedly told them that his revenge was “justified” as his daughter-in-law was having illicit relations with a tenant.Mahesh Kumar, a neighbour, said that residents of the locality started calling one other to check the authenticity of the murder reports. “We believed it only after the news channels started gathering outside the building and police officers confirmed the news on camera. No one can believe he has murdered four,” he said.Residents of the area said that upon spotting police in the area, they initially thought that the house had been ransacked in a robbery.A second neighbour, who did not want to be named, said that Singh might be taking the blame for a family member. A shopkeeper in the neighbourhood said, “He wanted the tenants to vacate the house but it is unbelievable that he could kill them over this. He is a god-fearing person.”However, a relative of the tenants who were murdered, said that he always troubled his tenants. “He has a questionable character,” Varendra Shukla, a relative of the deceased and a neighbour, said.Singh took early retirement from the Kumao regiment in 2001 and settled in Gururgam along with his family members, following which he started a real estate business. He was also the vice-president of the residents’ welfare association and took an active role to organise programmes on special occasions.Sushila Devi, a neighbour, said, “He used to teach underprivileged children in an open school and took one-hour classes every morning between 7am and 8am.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-murder-spree-hard-to-believe-suspect-killed-four-say-neighbours-101629829704293.html
24-08-2021||Gurugram||60K Covid vaccines to be administered in mega drive on August 27||Officials of the Gurugram health department said that they are planning to administer 60,000 Covid-19 vaccines on August 27, when around half a million people are set to be vaccinated across the state in a mega drive. The focus would be on people aged 18-45 years who are awaiting their second vaccine shot.“As directed by the state health department, a mega vaccination drive day will be observed in the district. As per the target, about 60,000 doses will be administered. Of these, 60% will be given as the second dose and 40% as the first dose. Roughly about 80,000 doses of Covishield have been earmarked by the state for the mega drive, whereas the second dose of Covaxin will be administered only at specific locations,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer of Gurugram. According to Yadav, there will be more than 100 vaccination centres under different health centres. “Both online and offline slots will be made available. Drive-through will be held at multiple locations to cover the target population of 18-45 years waiting for their second dose,” Yadav said. The highest vaccination count in a single day till now is 104,178, recorded on June 21, when the health department covered house helps, drivers, security staff, labourers and daily wage workers. Currently, over 2,228,139 vaccine doses have been administered in Gurugram since January 1, as per the data available on the Co-WIN portal. According to the Co-WIN portal, nearly 1.6 million people have taken the first jab, which indicates that 76% of the population has been inoculated with the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine if the eligible population count is taken as 2.1 million, as per a health department estimate. On Tuesday, at least 19,485 vaccine doses were administered in the city, including 13,573 doses at government health centres and 5,912 at private hospitals. For Wednesday, the district has allotted 16, 350 slots, of which 7,700 are for the first dose and 8,650 are for the second dose through direct walk-in. To increase the coverage among government school teachers, special vaccination camps will also be held at nine schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/60k-covid-vaccines-to-be-administered-in-mega-drive-on-august-27-101629829694828.html
24-08-2021||Gurugram||Iffco Chowk flyover to remain shut till Friday for repairs||The Iffco Chowk flyover on the Delhi to Jaipur side is likely to remain shut till later this week for repairs after a retaining wall of the flyover collapsed on Monday due to water damage.Officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said that a sewage pipeline passing under the structure was repaired by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority on Tuesday. The sewage pipeline was damaged due to the heavy flow of rainwater over the weekend and led to water accumulation that subsequently caused the collapse of the retaining wall.Officials said that the repair of the flyover would start from Wednesday morning.“The traffic on the flyover will remain closed for the next three to four days and during this time, we will build a raft on the drain below and construct concrete pillars to support the retaining wall to prevent such incidents in the future. Given the condition of the pipeline, we have also decided to pour concrete at the spot,” Saurabh Singhal, an NHAI consultant, said.NHAI officials said that they expect the traffic flow to resume on the flyover by Saturday.The flyover, which runs parallel to the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, was completed in 2019. It was part of a larger project launched in 2016 to build underpasses and flyovers at Rajiv Chowk, Signature Chowk and Iffco Chowk, important intersections on the expressway.On Monday, officials of Gawar Constructions, the contractor for the flyover, had said that they will start the repair on the flyover once the sewage line was repaired by the local authorities.The L-shaped underpass at Iffco Chowk was also constructed by the same contractor. In 2019, the roads on both sides of the L-shaped underpass had caved in after sewage pipelines overflowed following heavy rains in the National Capital Region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/iffco-chowk-flyover-to-remain-shut-till-friday-for-repairs-101629829692328.html
24-08-2021||Lucknow||Love for Muslim vote stopped you from paying tributes to Kalyan: BJP to Akhilesh||Uttar Pradesh BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh on Tuesday attacked Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, asking if the "love" for the Muslim vote bank prevented him from paying tributes to former state CM Kalyan Singh, who died after prolonged illness.A Hindutva icon and an OBC Lodh caste leader, Kalyan Singh was the chief minister of the state when the Babri mosque in Ayodhya was demolished by "Kar Sevaks" in 1992.He had died on Saturday after prolonged illness at a Lucknow hospital, after which his body was kept here for some time before the BJP leader's cremation with full state honours at Bansi Ghat in Bulandshahr's Narora town on Monday.Attacking the Samajwadi Party (SP) chief, Swatantra Dev Singh in a Hindi tweet said Yadav could not come barely one kilometre from his residence to Mall Avenue in Lucknow to pay tributes to Kalyan Singh."Has the love for the Muslim vote bank stopped him from paying tributes to the biggest leader of the backward class," he asked taking a swipe at Yadav.On the night of Kalyan Singh's death, Akhilesh Yadav had condoled his death in a tweet but neither he nor any other SP leaders went personally to pay respects to the former UP CM like some other opposition leaders.BSP chief Mayawati had gone to pay homage to Kalyan Singh. Kalyan Singh had earlier allied with SP patron Mulayam Singh Yadav after quitting the BJP and launching his own outfit.The bonhomie, however, lasted for a brief period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/love-for-muslim-vote-stopped-you-from-paying-tributes-to-kalyan-bjp-to-akhilesh-101629828251180.html
24-08-2021||Other||Odisha’s capital to allow only vaccinated people to enter religious places||The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Tuesday said all religious institutions under its jurisdiction can allow entry of devotees who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 as the active cases in the capital city doubled to what it was about a month ago.With the city still reporting cases in three digits, the BMC officials said that enforcement teams will conduct frequent checks to ensure adherence of the guidelines across all religious places. “Considering the current pandemic situation and vaccination coverage, it is hereby decided that people who are fully vaccinated will only be allowed inside any religious institutions. A person producing hard copy or soft copy in their mobile phones will be allowed inside the institutions,” the BMC order said, a day after all the religious places, barring the Lingaraj temple, were allowed to open their doors to the devotees.The insistence on Covid vaccination certificate in religious institutions of Bhubaneswar is the second instance when the authorities have made such certificates mandatory. The Jagannath temple in Puri, which opened its doors to devotees on August 16, also made it mandatory for devotees to have either a Covid vaccination certificate or a negative RT-PCR certificate.But barring Puri’s Jagannath temple and religious places of Bhubaneswar, there is no insistence by the local administration on the Covid vaccination certificate or RT-PCR negative report before allowing the devotees. After the state government last month gave the liberty to the district administrations to decide on the date of opening of the religious places and protocols, most district administrations have only laid stress on Covid appropriate behaviours like wearing of masks, regular sanitisation and social distancing.In Balasore’s famous Khirachora Gopinath temple, the opening of the shrine on Tuesday saw around 100 people coming to the temple though at least 1,000 people visit the temple to see the idols of Krishna and partake the sweet kheer. Manager of the temple, Mukund Das, said while Covid vaccination certificate has not been made mandatory, they are not allowing pregnant women, people above the age of 60 and children below the age of 10 years.“My biggest worry now is how to handle the crowd on Janmasthami on August 30, at least 5,000 people are likely to visit. Last year, we had no such worries as the temple remained closed and Janmasthami celebration was a tame affair. But this year, maintaining social distancing would be a tough task,” said Das.In Koraput’s Jagannath temple, Sambalpur’s Samaleswari temple and Kalahandi’s Manikeswari temple too, Covid vaccination certificate has not been made mandatory.Director of Public Health, Dr Niranjan Mishra said it would be inappropriate to comment on the decision of the respective district administrations on the opening of temples. “The Covid cases are on a decline in the state. The district collectors are the best people on the ground to take appropriate decisions,” he said.But Dr Samiran Panda, head of the epidemiology division of the ICMR, said mere social distancing and wearing masks would not work in religious places where the congregation is a reality.“Covid vaccination, social distancing and masking should be made mandatory in all religious places. Either this or that would not do. The vaccines are disease-modifying and do not prevent infections as we are seeing vaccinated people getting infected. In religious places, the authorities should allow only a particular number of people at any given time and there should be proper marking for each devotees,” said Dr Panda.Several Indian states have made it mandatory for devotees to produce a Covid-19 vaccination certificate or a negative RT-PCR test report. In Ujjain’s Mahakaleshwar, temple devotees need a vaccination certificate or RT-PCR report while in Kamakhya temple of Guwahati, only 20 fully vaccinated persons are allowed to enter the temple in an hour as per the Assam government’s order.However, the famous Balaji temple in Tirupati of Andhra Pradesh does not insist on a Covid vaccination certificate but allows only 6,000 devotees per day as against the normal rush of over 60,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-capital-to-allow-only-vaccinated-people-to-enter-religious-places-101629828725451.html
24-08-2021||Kolkata||Female contractual teachers allegedly consumed poison in Kolkata over job woes||Five female contractual teachers of primary schools allegedly consumed poison on Tuesday while demonstrating before the state education department headquarters in Kolkata, seeking immediate fulfilment of their job-related demands, a senior police officer said. Four of them "drank some liquid from bottles" as soon as they were arrested for forcefully entering the premises of Bikash Bhavan and shouting slogans in violation of the disaster management act, the officer said. The fifth woman, who tried to follow suit, was stopped by a woman constable before she could gulp down much of the liquid, he said. "All five were taken to a state-run hospital, where the condition of four was stated to be serious. The fifth woman is out of danger," the officer stated. The agitating teachers, all members of a platform for contractual school teachers, 'Sikshak Oikyo Mancha', had been seeking regularisation of services and revocation of transfer orders that have forced some of them to move to places that are far from their homes. The five teachers had earlier this month demonstrated before the residence of education minister Bratya Basu seeking to know why their demands were not being met with. Strongly reacting to the incident, BJP state vice president Jaiprakash Majumdar said, "Lack of concern on the part of the education minister prompted the teachers to consume poison." Kunal Ghosh, the ruling TMC's spokesperson, wished the teachers a speedy recovery. "It has to be looked into if there was any provocation from any quarter. A proper investigation will reveal the details," he added. The education minister and his department officials were not available for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/female-contractual-teachers-allegedly-consumed-poison-in-kolkata-over-job-woes-101629825822543.html
24-08-2021||Noida||Noida: Resident group creating awareness on lane driving||The 7X welfare team, along with the traffic police department, has launched a campaign to educate people about the importance of lane driving to ensure smooth flow of traffic on the city roads.Established in 2018, the team has over 15 volunteers who work with police to create awareness about various social issues in the city, traffic discipline being one of them.“On earlier occasions, we ran awareness campaigns regarding basic traffic regulations. For the next two months, we will keep conducting interactions with the public regarding proper lane driving,” said Brajesh Sharma, a member of 7X welfare team.The members are also creating awareness about leaving the left turns free and allowing pedestrians to use the zebra crossings.“All the moves are aimed at ensuring smooth flow of traffic in the city. Single lane driving and not changing lanes suddenly help prevent road accidents. Similarly, vehicles stopping on zebra crossings create inconvenience for both pedestrians and other vehicles. We interacted with commuters and other people near Spice mall over the weekend to create awareness about these issues. We plan to do the same near the Rajnigandha crossing this weekend. Single lane driving concept is missing in our city and people need to be educated about this,” said Sharma.Traffic police officials said they will support the campaign of the 7X welfare team. “Wrong side driving and not wearing helmets/seat belts have been in focus for a long time. Efforts will continue to discourage commuters against these traffic violations. But for the next two months, we will keep working with the team to focus on lane driving. This will help reduce accidents and also ensure smooth traffic movement in the city,” said Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), GB Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-resident-group-creating-awareness-on-lane-driving-101629828183681.html

Arvind Pathak, Dankaur police station house officer (SHO), said that the victim had gone to the farm with her six-year-old sister on Monday evening. “The suspect was roaming in the area when he found the girls, held the elder one and raped her,” he said. The suspect also gagged the victim and threatened her of consequences when she tried to raise an alarm, he added. The victim’s younger sister, meanwhile, managed to escape and informed some farmers working in the neighbouring field who came to rescue the girl, said police. The suspect had escaped by then, they added. The victim’s family filed a complaint with the Dankaur police. Pathak said a case was registered against the suspect under section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code and section 9 (10) of protection of children from sexual offences (Pocso) Act and section 3(2) of the SC/ST Act. “The suspect was arrested on Tuesday.

24-08-2021||Noida||Greater Noida’s Varun Bhati to jump for glory at Tokyo Paralympics||Para high jumper Varun Bhati, a resident of Greater Noida’s Sector Phi 3, is set to leave for Tokyo Paralympics on August 26. India has high hopes from the 26-year-old para athlete who won bronze medal in the men’s high jump T-42 event at the 2016 Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro. Bhati, a native of Jamalpur village in Gautam Budh Nagar, has been training extensively at his Greater Noida residence where he has made a whole setup for his practice. Apart from this, the para athlete, who won the World Para Athletics Championships in London in 2017, also trains at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Delhi and at SAI complex in Bengaluru.Bhati was afflicted with polio in his left leg when he was just six months old. He completed his schooling from St Joseph School in Greater Noida where his inclination to sports started. “I used to play basketball in the school. But after suggestion by one of my sports teachers, I started practising for high jump. In 2014, I went on to win a gold medal at the Open Athletics Championships in China at the age of 19,” said Bhati, who did his graduation (BSc) from Delhi University.India’s deputy chef de mission Arhan Bagati for Tokyo Paralympics, to be held from August 24-September 5, said that the country has high hopes from Bhati for bringing home a medal. “A total of 53 athletes across nine sports disciplines from India are heading for the Tokyo Paralympics. In the high jump category, we have high hopes from Varun as he has played at the Rio games earlier and also won a medal,” he said.However, Bhati says he doesn’t expect others to have high hopes from him this time as his performance has not been “up to the mark”. “It is good to know that apart from my family, others are also having high expectations from me. But my performance has not been up to the mark in the last two years. People didn’t expect me to clear the trials for Tokyo too, but fortunately I got selected,” said the Arjuna awardee.The reason behind this, he says, has been his back injury which he got during the 2017 World Para Athletics Championships in London. “Though I did get a medal in that game, my back pain got aggravated. Since then, while I have continued to play, the pain did not subside,” said Bhati.However, the one year delay in Tokyo Paralympics due to the Covid-19 pandemic came as a boon for him. “My injury took longer than expected to heal. But the Paralympics also got delayed due to the pandemic, which allowed me one more year to recover. Had the Games been held in 2020, I would not have even been selected,” said Bhati. In April this year, Bhati had to lose one month of his training as he was down with Covid-19. “On April 14, I tested positive for Covid-19 and was in home isolation. I was on complete bed rest for a month and felt like I lost out on precious training time ahead of trials for Tokyo. Thankfully, I recovered from Covid in June and got selected for the games. The trials were held on June 29,” he said.Bhati, who has also won a silver in 2018 Asian Para Games in Indonesia, will be competing in the T42/63 category of men’s high jump at the Tokyo Paralympic Games on August 31. “I am confident of giving my best at the Games and hope I can get a medal for India,” said Bhati.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-s-varun-bhati-to-jump-for-glory-at-tokyo-paralympics-101629828007235.html

24-08-2021||Mumbai||Second Mumbai varsity merit list to be out today; very few seats left, say colleges||The second merit list for colleges affiliated with the University of Mumbai (MU) is scheduled to be released today (Wednesday). However, the popular city colleges said they have very few seats left to offer, even though the number of seats across colleges is higher than the number of students registered for admissions this year.“Due to the fear of not getting another seat, most students allotted seats in the first round, have confirmed admissions. We will have very few seats left for the second list,” said Ashok Wadia, principal of Jai Hind College, Churchgate. The first merit list for undergraduate degree courses was announced on August 17 and students whose names appeared in the list have time until August 25 to confirm their seats. By evening, the university will announce the second merit list.“Since the entire process is taking place online again this year, many students are worried as they can’t clear doubts face-to-face. We get calls all day from anxious students, and try our best to help everyone,” said the principal of a suburban college. She added that while students are confirming admissions, for now, there’s a chance of seats in BSc courses going vacant once admissions to medical, dental and paramedical courses begin.Earlier this month, the state government released circular addressing it to state universities and the respective affiliated colleges, stating that due to a higher number of students clearing class 12 exams this year, automatically increasing the number of candidates applying for admissions, colleges have been given the option to add an extra division to certain popular courses to accommodate all students.“Adding a new division will not be an easy task for colleges.

24-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Despite complaints destructed mangroves await restoration, say experts||Since its inception in 2018, the Bombay high court (HC)-appointed Mangrove Protection and Conservation Committee (MPCC) has received an estimated 142 complaints regarding the destruction of mangroves in the state’s coastal districts. Of these, about 88 complaints have been ‘resolved’, with a few have been transferred to the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) for their consideration. Another 54 odd complaints are pending resolution, according to committee members. However, committee members (including officials in the forest department’s mangrove cell) confirmed to Hindustan Times that not a single complaint has so far resulted in the restoration of damaged mangroves, which is part of the mandate given to the committee by the HC in its final judgement from September 2018.At the time, the HC had emphasised, “One...important issue is to restore mangroves areas which are illegally reclaimed. The said areas have to be restored to their original condition. That is the legal obligation of the state. In what manner restoration should be done, should be decided by the committee headed by the divisional commissioner after consulting experts in the field.”Commenting on the matter, Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF), mangrove cell, said, “I do not think any of the complaints have so far resulted in the restoration of the area. That is something we have kept funds for but cannot proceed with until the various municipal corporations or land-owning agencies clean up the debris first. The restoration will be done by the forest department but cleaning up the area is their responsibility.”Of the total number of complaints received by the committee, only nine have so far been shortlisted for restoration activities — which are still pending. Though environmentalists say there are likely to be several complaints where the committee has overlooked the need for the restoration itself. Navi Mumbai-based activist BN Kumar gave the example of mangrove destruction along the Sion-Panvel Highway, allegedly done by a contractor of the Public Works Department (PWD).“The damage on sight warrants restoration. Even the debris has not been cleaned, but the complaint came up for resolution in the agenda of the last Mangrove Committee meeting,” Kumar added. Giving a second example of mangrove destruction at Pagote in Uran, within the erstwhile Navi Mumbai Special Economic Zone, he added, “In that matter, an FIR has been registered against unknown persons, but there seems to be no effort taken to restore acres of buried mangroves.”Neenu Somraj, deputy conservator of forests (mangrove cell), said that the committee’s work is an ongoing process and that all complaints will be duly reviewed. “Many cases are open and shut cases where collectors have conducted sight visits and filed inspection reports. In these matters, FIRs have been filed as per protocol and small debris dumps have also been cleaned up. In some complaints, the scale of damage is larger, and those will take a little longer to restore. Those cases have not been closed.”Stalin D, director of NGO Vanashakti and an independent member appointed to the MPCC, emphasised that lack of restoration amounts to non-compliance of HC’s orders. “Not only are smaller violations being let off, but the committee has also not yet sent any show-cause notices to municipalities asking them to address the biggest violators. In Thane, for example, long stretches of cement roads have been made over mangroves and cement mixers have come up in the forest patches. The committee needs to act sooner and pull up the municipalities, otherwise, small complaints will keep getting resolved without serious investigation, and bigger complaints will lie unaddressed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaidespite-complaints-destructed-mangroves-await-restoration-say-experts-101629827884225.html

On these exclusive days, which are yet to be decided, and at the five exclusive booths — primary health centres in Dadri, Jewar, Dankaur and Sector 22, and Mihirbhoj Inter College in Dadri — all adults would be allowed to walk-in for the jabs, apart from bookings through Co-Win, said officials.The district has so far administered 1.9 million doses, of which only 426,439 are second doses, according to Co-WIN on Tuesday till 8pm. On Tuesday, the district administered 13,960 doses. It was only from May 1 that the vaccination coverage was expanded to cover all adults. Covshield has a waiting period of a 12 to 16 weeks for the second shot, while Covaxin’s wait is a month.Most people have been vaccinated with Covishield due to more supply of the vaccine over the last few months, so the number of people scheduled to get their second dose is likely to increase in the coming days and months.GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said, “We aim to cover 2,000 people a day in all these five exclusive booths. The low coverage of the second dose has meant that we need to focus more on it. We’ll soon decide the days on which only second doses will be administered.” District immunisation officer Dr Neeraj Tyagi said that as many as 9,758 doses of vaccines were administered in 32 government inoculation booths on Tuesday. “Out of it, 5,224 persons received their first dose, while the remaining 4,534 beneficiaries took their second jab,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-admin-to-dedicate-three-days-a-week-for-second-dose-of-covid-vaccines-101629827764196.html

The Central government told the Apex court on Tuesday that they would file their reply on the petition in the next three weeks, the officials said.To restore political reservation for the OBC in local bodies, the state government has sought Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) data of Maharashtra from the Central government by filing a writ petition in the Apex court last month.The petition was heard by the bench of justice AM Khanwilkar and justice Sanjiv Khanna on Tuesday.OBCs are on the verge of losing their political reservation in local bodies across Maharashtra as it was quashed by the Apex court in March and its review petition in May. The Apex court has ruled that the reservation in favour of the OBC in local bodies should not result in exceeding the 50% cap in reservation quota determined by it. It has further directed the state government to appoint a dedicated commission for collecting empirical data, based on which, the reservation quota of the community is fixed.“The Apex court also asked the state government to pursue the Centre for SECC data of Maharashtra that was conducted in 2011. Following the directives, the state government pursued the matter with them. Since there was no response, the state government decided to file the petition before SC seeking its directives to the registrar general and census commissioner, ministry of social justice and empowerment and rural development to provide the caste-based data of Maharashtra,” said a senior official from law and judiciary department.On July 5, the state legislature passed a resolution seeking empirical data by the Centre, collected under Socio-Economic Caste Census 2011, for restoration of the political reservation to OBCs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/obc-reservation-in-maharashtra-centre-to-file-its-reply-in-three-weeks-101629826384154.html

24-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC to take waste pickers’ group on board for waste segregation at Deonar||Almost five years after Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) disallowed waste pickers from entering the Deonar dumping ground, following a series of fires to garbage mounds in the dumping ground in 2016, it will take them on board for waste segregation at Deonar, and at four refuse transfer stations — Mahalaxmi, Kurla, Gorai, and Versova.At least 50 waste pickers will be identified and verified to officially segregate waste at the Deonar dumping ground, and 25 waste pickers will be identified for segregate waste at each of the four refuse transfer stations. BMC is tying up with non-commercial organisations working with waste pickers to facilitate this. It recently invited an expression of interest inviting registered waste picker organisations, to tie up with BMC on a non-commercial basis for the project.A senior official from the civic solid waste management department said, “With this, we want to create a form of employment opportunity for this informal sector workforce. We will not be paying the organisations any money. It will be the task of the organisations to transport the segregated waste to recyclers.”Presently, waste is supposed to be segregated at the ward level. BMC has a waste to energy plant at the Kanjurmarg dumping ground. About 600-700 metric tons (MT) of municipal solid waste (MSW) is received at the Deonar dumping ground, 600 MT of MSW is received at the Mahalaxmi and Kurla refuse transfer stations, 400 MT of MSW is received at the Gorai refuse transfer station, and 300 MT of MSW is received at the Versova Lagoon refuse transfer station.The waste picker organisations which will come on board with BMC will be responsible for removing and transporting segregated dry or non-biodegradable waste daily to recyclers and providing safety gear to the waste pickers.Between January and March 2016, a series of large fires were reported inside the Deonar dumping grounds, prompting BMC to take up several security measures included fortifying the entire periphery of the dumping ground premises with high concrete fencing, installing CCTV cameras, and disallowing waste pickers from entering the dumping grounds for segregation and collection of waste.Over the course of one year after the fires, BMC decided to issue id-cards to waste pickers to allow them entry into the dumping ground premises, but the decision did not materialise at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-bmc-to-take-waste-pickers-group-on-board-for-waste-segregation-at-deonar-101629826024195.html

The company produces one of the world’s best supersonic cruise missile system BrahMos, it said.The facility comes under the aerospace firm’s expansion for the BrahMos Next Generation (BrahMos-NG) Missile project. The establishment of the facility will make UP an aerospace and defence hub of India as it will bring in niche technologies. It will also put Lucknow prominently on the world map as a manufacturing hub for top-notch technologies, the statement said.The plant would come up with an approximate investment of ₹300 crore and provide direct employment to 500 engineers and technical staff. Besides, around 10,000 people will get indirect employment. In three years, the plant will have the capacity to manufacture 100 BrahMos missiles. According to government sources, Yogi Adityanath gave his consent to the project and directed officials to allocate land to BrahMos Aerospace. The company was likely to start production within three months of getting possession of land. Mishra also sent a letter to Awanish Awasthi, additional chief secretary (home) and CEO of UPEIDA, for allotment of land in Lucknow. According to BrahMos Aerospace, the company has a production facility in Hyderabad, Nagpur and Pilani. It was formed on February 12, 1998, as a joint venture between DRDO and joint stock company ‘Military Industrial Consortium’ of Russia. According to government officials, the proposal also mentioned about the order of 400 BrahMos missiles (worth ₹8000 crore) by the Indian Air Force. The company wants to execute this order at its proposed manufacturing unit in Lucknow. At the Lucknow unit, BrahMos Aerospace will also execute its export orders in future. Over 200 small, medium and large Indian public and private sector defence enterprises, institutions and laboratories have been associated with the prestigious BrahMos missile programme, said the state government. The Defence Corridor has six nodes, including Aligarh, Agra, Jhansi, Chitrakoot, Kanpur and Lucknow. On February 21, 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the ₹20,000 crore Defence Industrial Corridor in Bundelkhand region, which was considered as one of the most backward regions of UP.

On Tuesday, 20 trucks carrying dry fruit from Afghanistan arrived at the Attari Integrated Check Post (ICP), which facilitates India’s trade with Pakistan and Afghanistan.  “On Monday, 21 trucks arrived at the ICP, with 20 on Tuesday. To date, There is no indication of any halt in import from the war-torn country,” said a senior official of the Land Ports Authority of India (LPAI), which manages the ICP’s affairs.ICP manager Sukhdev Singh said trade has not seen a dip due to the happenings in Afghanistan; sources added that 20 trucks with dry fruit has arrived at the ICP on Saturday as well, but Customs officials had to send back some of these due to inadequate space. An official posted at the ICP said, “The Customs has also increased its security since Taliban seized control of Afghanistan. Officials have been conducting 100% search of items being imported.”Indian and Afghan traders, however, are worried over trade prospects and hope that the regime change, enforced through bloodshed, does not cast a shadow on trade. “We hope that the trade between the countries will continue as usual, as has been the case till today. There was some speculation that the Taliban had sealed both Chaman and Torkham borders with Pakistan. We are in touch with our counterparts in Afghanistan. They are also worried, but are hope like us that the crises does not affect trade,” said Anil Mehra, president, Federation of Karyana and Dry Fruit Association.He added, “The festival season is approaching and there will be high demand for dry fruit in India. If dry fruit import to India continues, prices will come down. There is a bumper crop of dry fruit in Afghanistan this year. Afghan traders are sending their items uninterrupted, even though there has been an issue kin sending them payments due to closure of banks there.”In 2019-20, the ICP had recorded a business of ₹2,767 crore, which dipped to ₹2,500 crore in 2020-21. Prior to this, the ICP had been recording a trade value between ₹4,000 crore and ₹5,000 crore trade a year.Trade at the ICP has been dipping since the Pulwama terror attack of February 2019, in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed. After the attack, India had increased duty on items imported from Pakistan from 5% to 200%. In August 2019, when New Delhi abrogated Article 370 which gave special powers to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan had ceased trade with India. The neighbouring country had also barred India from exporting goods to Afghanistan. Since then, the ICP sees import only from Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/afghan-crisis-dry-fruit-import-through-icp-continues-as-usual-101629825604332.html
24-08-2021||Other||MLAs, MLCs to use LAD funds for private societies: State||PUNE: After MLAs (members of legislative assemblies) were allowed to use local area development (LAD) funds for social, cultural, literary, educational, environmental and sports activities in 2017, the state government is now working on a proposal to allow MLAs and members of legislative councils (MLCs) to use LAD funds for developing basic infrastructure in private societies based in rural and municipal corporation areas. While societies have welcomed the move, they have warned against politicisation of the same.The state on Monday constituted a planning committee to frame the guidelines and scope of work in private societies. The committee includes the deputy secretary of the planning department, Mumbai and Pune; assistant/deputy municipal commissioner of the Thane municipal corporation; deputy registrar of Thane; deputy commissioner of Konkan, Nashik and Nagpur divisions; district planning officer of Pune, Thane and Mumbai city; chief executive officer of Shahapur, Baramati and Ambernath; joint director of the planning department of the state; and deputy commissioner of the municipal council department of the Konkan division. An order was issued by Debashish Chakraborty, upper secretary of the state planning department, giving a two-month deadline for submission of the report to the government after which the state will take the final decision. This might help the state government ahead of elections in 10 municipal corporations including the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), municipal councils, and 25 zilla parishads.About the development, Chetan Tupe, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLA of the Hadapsar assembly constituency, said, “It is a good decision and is needed to tackle the problems of rapid urbanisation in the city and fringe areas. Most of the middle class lives in societies and they are regular and honest taxpayers and MLAs’ LAD funds are nothing but taxpayers’ money. Till date, there were limitations in terms of using funds in private societies but the Mahavikas Aghadi (MVA) government has now decided to use them. Over the last few years, new societies have developed a mechanism to use maintenance charges for the development of the society. However, old societies do not have the financial support to generate funds for development so this decision will help them a lot. We should have new provisions or amendments in old laws or rules for the welfare of the public.”Sunil Tingre, MLA of the Wadgaonsheri constituency, said, “This will help provide better infrastructure to societies including light, internal roads, drainage and water supply. It is the basic things that people want from the government or the local administration. Our funds will be utilised for a good cause. At present, we have limited scope as regards usage of funds and this is true for most local corporators and MLAs. Typically, the funds are used in slum areas or localities not covered under private societies which is unfair to societies.”Suhas Patwardhan, chairman of the Pune District Cooperative Federation, said, “There are around 11,000 housing societies in the Pune city area. The decision is good if the intention is to use MLA funds for the development of societies. However, there should be no politicisation and political agenda. There are old societies which really need help to develop basic infrastructure. Again, these funds cannot be used for things like benches, name plates and garbage bins. They should be put to productive use based on the society’s needs rather than the MLA’s whims. After all, it is public money and should not be wasted on fancy, unproductive things, which is being witnessed at the corporation level.”Back in September 2017, the state decided to allow MLAs to use LAD funds for social, cultural, literary, educational, environmental, and sports activities with prior approval of the government (state finance minister). Thereafter, a total 288 MLAs got the opportunity to use LAD funds for works other than development. While MLAs can spend Rs20 lakh in a year for cultural and social events organised by NGOs, they cannot spend more than Rs5 lakh on each activity. The LAD funds enable each MLA to undertake small developmental works in their constituencies through an allocation of Rs2 crore per year. The works are on a micro scale and fall within the jurisdiction of the MLA’s constituency, and typically include works that may have been overlooked by the local administration in its annual budget. After submission of the proposal by the MLA, the district authority is mandated to implement the same within three months of acceptance of the proposal. The objective of the LAD funds is to strengthen the local community infrastructure, including roads, school buildings, drinking water, public health, sanitation, electricity, health and family welfare, irrigation and so on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mlas-mlcs-to-use-lad-funds-for-private-societies-state-101629824823392.html

The adjournment was prompted after the counsel for the state informed the bench that they have approached higher officials and will have a meeting with CBI counsel to work out the issue amicably.The CBI approached the HC stating that though the court, through its July 22 order, had permitted the investigating agency to continue its investigations into the allegations made by former commissioner of intelligence Rashmi Shukla in her report, wherein she alleged political interference and corruption in transfers and postings of police officers in the state, the state was not cooperating and was resorting to threatening its officers. On August 20, the division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, while hearing the CBI application seeking directions to the state government to provide documents on the FIR lodged against Deshmukh and others, had questioned the state as to why it was not handing over the documents. “In the July 22 ruling (dismissing pleas by Deshmukh and state against CBI FIR), we just said that even if the documents are handed over to CBI, it would not give CBI unfettered powers to use them to investigate every posting. You cannot object to sharing those documents. At this stage, please consider giving them,” the bench had said.On Tuesday, senior advocate Rafiq Dada for the state submitted he along with senior counsel Darius Khambata had approached the higher authorities and would be able to reconcile the situation after which they would hold a meeting with the additional solicitor general Anil Singh who represents the CBI and try to resolve the matter. “We want to put an end to this,” said Dada. The bench accepted the same and granted time to find a solution and posted further hearing to Thursday, August 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rashmi-shukla-report-will-try-to-resolve-issue-of-documents-with-cbi-maharashtra-govt-tells-hc-101629824644014.html

She did various odd jobs in the city. On July 22, she suffered severe injuries on her head after she was hit by a train near Sanpada station and the GRP admitted her to Sion hospital in Mumbai. Vishnu Kesarkar, senior inspector of Vashi GRP, said, “Just after the accident, she told us that she was from Nepal and stayed in Andheri. We then searched for her relatives in Andheri but to no avail. One of her documents also had an address in Bhayandar, but we could not find anyone there either. Meanwhile, her condition deteriorated and she succumbed on August 2.“Around that time, we came across a few members of a Nepali Association in Mumbai and sought their help to find her family members.

More meetings will be held in the coming weeks. “The party wants to review its organizational strength since polls in around a hundred civic bodies will be held in the coming months. The feedback we received was not encouraging. While some people did not attend, those who did, said footfall at meetings and public events has gone down after the poll results were announced on May 2,” said a state BJP leader who did not want to be named. “Fear of reprisal from Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers was cited as one of the reasons for absenteeism. The district unit leaders also admitted that many people who left the TMC and switched sides prior to the polls are feeling disillusioned. Mandal committee presidents from South 24 Parganas and Kolkata said workers were unhappy with the selection of candidates in several constituencies. They complained that their opinions were not taken into account,” said a second BJP leader. “Although Shivprakash and the state leaders could not work out an instant solution, the district leaders were told to register their grievances. They were given a phone number and an e-mail address. Shivprakash assured them that the national election committee would be apprised of the situation,” the BJP leader added. Dilip Ghosh said after the meeting that the district leaders were also told to co-operate with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) which has been asked by the Calcutta high court to probe the charges of post-poll violence.BJP leader and lawyer Priyanka Tibrewal said she is touring the districts to record more complaints. “On Monday, several complaints were lodged at Dantan, Ghatal and Belda police stations in West Midnapore district,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/at-meeting-bengal-bjp-leaders-told-about-district-leaders-workers-staying-away-after-poll-defeat-101629823864736.html

We climbed up only to see that the rubble had been flattened to look like a kuchcha road and immediately alerted the citizens of the area and called the authorities,” said Deepak Shrotri of Vasundhara Abhiyaan.Meanwhile, officials of both the PMC and Smart City on Tuesday said they had not authorised any work on the road.Arun Godbole, chief engineer, PSPDCL, said, “We stopped work on July 6, 2019 and no work has been allowed since. All excavations were carried out on land excluding the BDP (bio-diversity park) area. Only 40 to 70 metre under the BDP was touched, which is less than 0.5% of the total BDP area. We have decided to reassess and align the road with the existing road, thus protecting the hills. We have not given any permission for this road.”Dinkar Gojare from the PMC road department said, “The PMC has not awarded any tenders or orders for any road to be developed in this area as we do not have the budget. This is not sanctioned by us.”Sandip Khalate, assistant commissioner of the Aundh ward office who was on site with his engineers and surveyed the area along with corporators Ganesh Kalamkar and Prahlad Saikar, said that he would write to the health department to clear the debris and rubble before it caused any harm due to the rains.Following these assurances, the residents then filed a complaint against those responsible and sent letters to the PMC and Smart City to take further action.Back in 2019, the residents had similarly raised an alarm over Smart City’s plan to build a road alongside the tekdi, cutting across its slopes. At the time, Rajendra Jagtap, the then chief executive officer of the Pune Smart City Development Corporation Limited, had given in to the residents’ demands to protect the Baner-Pashan hills and agreed to reconsider constructing the road and compromising the hills that were part of a BDP area. “We had then too stated that we are not against the road but we need to protect the hills and need to reassess the need for an 18 metre road as against the recommendation of a nine metre one,” said Vaishali Patkar, a resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-denies-sanctioning-road-work-on-baner-pashan-hills-area-residents-claim-debris-shows-otherwise-101629823563229.html

A case has since been registered against Rane in Pune, while another case was filed by the cybercell of the Nashik Police, ordering for arrest. The third FIR has been registered in Mahad.“Yes, a case has been registered,” said Amitabh Gupta, commissioner of police, Pune.The complaint against Rane was lodged by Rohit Kadam of the Pune unit of the Yuva Sena, the youth wing of the Shiv Sena, at the Chaturshrungi police station.A case under Sections 153, 153B(1)(c), and 505(2) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered at Chaturshrungi police station. Senior police inspector Rajkumar Vaghchaure is investigating the case.BJP leaders said that despite the cases, Rane’s yatra will continue. The yatra has currently reached Chiplun, where police have increased security considering strong reactions from the Shiv Sena. “Rane has an aggressive style of saying things. His is a style also known as ‘Balasaheb Thackeray’s style’,” said BJP spokesperson Ram Kadam. Another complaint was lodged at the cyber police station of Nashik police by Sudhakar Bhika Badgujar, head of Nashik city unit of Shiv Sena. A case under Sections 500, 505(2), 153B(1)(c) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Cyber police station, Nashik.A case under similar sections and complaint was also registered in Mahad, Raigad.BJP leaders said that despite the cases, Rane’s yatra will continue.

24-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sachin Vaze moves NIA court for treatment at private hospital||Dismissed encounter specialist Sachin Vaze has moved the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court to allow him to take treatment at a private hospital, claiming that he had three major heart blockages.The NIA had arrested Vaze on March 13 in connection with the recovery of an explosives-laden Scorpio found parked near industrialists Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence on February 25 with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a note threatening to kill the Ambani family members.Vaze has been suffering from chest pain since August 12 and is undergoing treatment at Sir JJ Hospital.Special NIA judge Prashant R Sitre was informed about the plea on Saturday when the judicial custody of Vaze and other four accused — dismissed assistant inspector Riyazuddin Kazi, inspector Sunil Mane, Vinayak Shinde and bookie Naresh Gor ended.“When I asked Vaze to be joined on video conference for extension of his judicial custody, I came to know Vaze was being taken to JJ Hospital from the jail since August 12. His lawyers are informed about the treatment, but neither the lawyers, nor NIA officers, nor the jail authorities informed me about it,” judge Sitre told Vaze’s counsel advocate Raunak Naik on Tuesday.Naik informed the court that Vaze had three blockages, including two to the extent of 90% and in the past, he has been advised to undergo bypass surgery.Naik moved separate applications on Tuesday before the court for allowing family members to meet Vaze at JJ Hospital, for home food and for allowing Vaze to take treatment at a private hospital.The court rejected his first application for allowing him to meet his family members after NIA special public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves opposed it.The court is likely to decide on other two applications for home food and treatment at a private hospital on August 27, after NIA stated that the agency was waiting for Vaze’s fresh medical reports from JJ Hospital.On Saturday the court had extended the judicial custody of Vaze and four other accused including Kazi, Mane, Shinde and Gor after the NIA made a statement that it will file a charge-sheet against them on September 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-sachin-vaze-moves-nia-court-for-treatment-at-private-hospital-101629823023770.html
24-08-2021||Other||Rane arrest: Legal experts don’t see “enough ingredients” in FIR; BJP targets Nashik CP||PUNE From controversial remarks made by Union minister Narayan Rane, to his arrest within a span of 24 hours, high drama unfolded in Maharashtra between Monday and Tuesday. Legal and constitutional experts, however, differed on the action taken against Rane, even as they criticised his remarks. As per Parliamentary privileges, a member of Parliament is not “liable for arrest or detention in prison, under a civil process, during the continuance of a session of the House or meetings of any committees, of which he may be a member, and during forty days before and after such session/meeting.” However, members of parliament are provided no such freedom from arrest in criminal cases. Citing legal provisions, BJP state unit chief Chandrakant Patil said the police can’t “just arrest Rane”. Ulhas Bapat, constitutional expert, said the case is political and he doesn’t see enough material in sections invoked by police. “First of all, Rane should not have made those remarks, which shows how the political discourse has been lowered in Maharashtra. However, If we have to see the sections in the FIR, I don’t see enough ingredients for the police,” said Bapat. Criminal lawyer Milind Pawar said, “Police have discretion to act against persons making such remarks. Since the local court in Ratnagiri has rejected anticipatory bail, the judge has seen some merit in the FIR. At the same time, we should keep in mind that this is a political case and it will have political repercussions.” The action (arrest) against Rane came following three FIRs filed against him, one each in Pune, Nashik and Mahad. However, when Nashik police commissioner Deepak Pandey ordered Narayan Rane arrested for his “would have slapped the chief minister” remark, by constituting a team under a DCP level officer, it raised eyebrows and drew a strong reaction from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Former chief minister and leader of the opposition Devendra Fadnavis said the Nashik police commissioner’s approach seems motivated. “This would have been a non-cognisable offence. However, Nashik CP thinks he is above everyone. The way he has given directions for Rane’s arrest suggests his actions are motivated. The government on its part is misusing the police force,” said Fadnavis. The detailed order by Pandey, who constituted a team under deputy commissioner Sanjay Barkund, was questioned by the BJP, in terms of his powers to arrest Rane, a union minister with privileges. According to Pandey, the Nashik cybercell filed an FIR against Rane under section 500, 505(2), 153 (b) (1) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). “Considering the seriousness of the issue, I have asked DCP-level officer Sanjay Barkund to constitute a team and produce Rane before the court after arresting him,” said Pandey in a written order, a copy of which, is with Hindustan Times. The team under Barkund was dispatched to Chiplun where Rane is holding his Jan-Ashirwad yatra. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Rane said he would have “tightly slapped” chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for allegedly being ignorant of the country’s year of independence. Earlier in the day, when arrest order was questioned by Rane and the BJP, Pandey clarified that rule of law will be followed and police will ensure privileges attached to the union minister will not be breached. “We are following rule of law. Rane is a member of Rajya Sabha. Therefore, the Rajya Sabha president will be informed about Rane after his arrest. We will also inform the local court post our action. The decision to arrest and my order in this regard is based on the facts of the case and I would like to state here that police will ensure no privileges will be breached during our action,” said Pandey. “No state government/authorities can arrest any Union cabinet minister as per the constitutional provisions. If the police go ahead and act, they will face the brunt of the court,” said Patil in Pune. The BJP state unit chief also brought up previous controversial remarks by Thackeray, when no action was taken. “Uddhav Thackeray had used similar language against Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the Lok Sabha elections in 2019. His language at the Dussehra rally was equally objectionable,” said Patil. An Indian Police Service officer of the 1999 batch, Pandey took charge as Nashik CP in September 2020. Earlier too, Pandey was in focus when he ordered a probe against Sena minister Anil Parab, under the same DCP Sanjay Barkund, who headed the team to arrest Rane. Pandey had earlier, on May 27, ordered an inquiry into the allegation of corruption in transfers and posting against Parab and others, saying the probe will be completed soon. After the probe, Parab was given clean chit by the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rane-arrest-legal-experts-don-t-see-enough-ingredients-in-fir-bjp-targets-nashik-cp-101629822903795.html

The Shiv Sena agitation turned violent when workers pelted stones at a mall in Deccan Gymkhana. The mall is owned by the Rane family. The sainiks shouted slogans against Rane, who on Monday said “he would have slapped” Shiv Sena leader and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray “for his ignorance about the year in which India gained its independence”. Sena workers warned that whenever Rane and his two sons arrive in Pune, the Sena would once again stage a protest. Party workers also agitated in front of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) office on Jangli Maharaj road.BJP workers then went to the Shiv Sena office located at Pulachi Wadi near Deccan and also staged a protest. The BJP workers carried a cat along with them, implying that though the Shiv Sena’s political symbol is the tiger, the party’s attitude is best represented by a cat right now. When the Ratnagiri police arrested Rane on Tuesday evening, the BJP’s city unit agitated at the Balgandharva chowk, calling the arrest illegal. BJP’s city unit president Jagdish Mulik led the agitation.Members of the Maha Vikas Agadhi (MVA) also organised a protest at Mandai in front of the statue of Lokmanya Tilak.NCP city president Prashant Jagtap, Congress city unit president Ramesh Bagwe and Sena leaders participated in the agitation. Jagtap said, “Maharashtra’s political culture is different. Though Rane has become minister, he has used foul language against the chief minister.

Votes will be counted on the following day of polling of each phase of the election during which about 6.39 crore electors are expected to vote.At a press conference on Tuesday, SEC Prasad said electronic voting machines (EVMs) would be used for the first time in the rural bodies elections. “However, elections for panch and sarpanch will be conducted through the ballot papers.

The last panchayat elections were held five years ago in 10 phases, which had nearly 6.44 crore electors. “The number of electors and panchayat bodies have been reduced due to reorganisation of urban bodies, in which 315 panchayats lost their existence and 186 panchayats were partially hit,” said the SEC, adding that about 1 lakh polling personnel would be engaged along with nearly 90,000 security personnel. The candidates will have online and physical arrangement for filing their nominations, which has been scheduled phase-wise. “Like in assembly elections, we have decided to appoint micro-observers for the first time in panchayat elections. Any case of poll code violations will be dealt with firmly,” said Prasad, adding that the commission had received around 2.21 lakh EVMs against its requirement of 2.56 lakh.About 2 lakh ballot boxes will be used in the elections to elect sarpanchs and panchs to make up for the absence of EVMs with desired specifications.

So they had shifted to other states.” Shivaji Kumar said para sports started in the state in 2000. “ It was held at the Moin-ul Haq stadium at Rajendra Nagar in state capital with 200 para sportspersons.

24-08-2021||Patna||AIIMS-Patna restores emergency services after one year||Trauma and emergency services resumed on Monday after over a year at Patna’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). “As many as 64 patients were examined, of which 24 were admitted, since its reopening after over 13 months on Monday,” said Dr Anil Kumar, additional professor of surgery and head, trauma and emergency department, AIIMS-Patna. Trauma and emergency services were closed for the general public since July 12, 2020, after the state government declared the institute a dedicated Covid-19 hospital on July 10 last year, he added. The institute had to redeploy its manpower and resources to cope with the once burgeoning Covid patient load. It had to suspend many services, including trauma and emergency, outpatient department (OPD) consultation, elective surgeries and admission of non-Covid cases, said officials at the institute. All hospital services have, however, been restored gradually from December 28, last year. Trauma and emergency services are the last among them to be restored now. “We restored our trauma and emergency services from Monday as the number of Covid-19 patients seeking admission at our institute has come down,” said Dr Prabhat Kumar Singh, director, AIIMS-Patna. The AIIMS had only one patient admitted in its Covid-19 ward as on date. There were no new admissions in the Covid ward between August 13 and 19. “We have reduced the number of beds in our Covid ward to 30 while deciding to restore all our services. We restored full OPD services around a month back. As many as 16 operation theatres (OTs) of the available 28 are now functional. Of them, two OTs are dedicated for trauma and emergency,” said Dr Singh. The trauma and emergency department at AIIMS accords priority to the admission of acute trauma cases instead of those transferred from other hospitals and nursing homes. “Given the limited number of beds — there are 60 beds in the trauma and emergency wing — we give priority to acute trauma cases instead of transferred cases from other health facilities. In case of referrals, we expect to have proper communication with the health facility referring its patient to us before they actually send them,” said Dr Kumar. He said the trauma and emergency wing had proactively treated non-Covid cases of hospital staff, their relatives and those brought by the police with gunshot injury or road traffic accident during the 11-month closure period. As many as 5,115 patients were reported to the AIIMS trauma and emergency wing between April 1, 2020, and March 31 this year, added Dr Kumar. The Bihar government had declared AIIMS a centre of excellence for the management of Covid-19 in the state last year. The AIIMS extended treatment to over 5,700 Covid-19 patients, of which around 1,300 succumbed to the virus..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/aiimspatna-restores-emergency-services-after-one-year-101629822305066.html

The inauguration came as a big relief for the locals as the facility would bring quality healthcare in the temple town as the controversy surrounding its opening had even reached the Jharkhand High Court after the Hemant Soren government had filed a petition seeking for the OPD to be made operational at the earliest. The court had fixed the next date of hearing on August 26.Addressing the event, the Union health minister said the Narendra Modi government was working in boosting health care facilities across the country. “I am pleased to inaugurate the OPD services and night shelter in temple town Deoghar. The Prime Minister had laid the foundation of this hospital in May 2018. While the OPD would provide health service to the locals, people coming from far off places would have the option of staying back in the night shelter,” he said.The AIIMS campus is coming up in the Devipur area on the outskirts of the temple town. With the inauguration of the OPD services, around 200 patients would be able to avail the services of a dozen specialist doctors of different medical departments every day. A 15-bed daycare facility has been set up for the patients coming to the OPD for treatment at the 4-room complex set up at the institute. Around 20 kinds of pathological test facilities have been arranged at the centre, officials said.Earlier, speaking on the occasion, Member of Parliament Nishikant Dubey hit out at the district administration for not completing some critical aspects of the project. “Installing big cutouts would not be enough. The DC should explain why there has been a delay in the land acquisition and widening of the road near the institute,” Dubey said in his short speech.State tourism minister Hafizul Hassan reminded the contribution made by the state government that has provided land for the institute and also suggested the Centre increase fund allocation as done for AIIMS in other states..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/union-health-minister-inaugurates-deoghar-aiims-opd-101629822243577.html

24-08-2021||Lucknow||Anomalies in Indo-Nepal border road construction hit SSB mobility: CAG||The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India in its audit report has claimed that shortcomings in preparatory works, project execution, monitoring and financial management by Uttar Pradesh public works department (UPPWD) in the construction of road along the Indo-Nepal border under Indo-Nepal Border Road Project (INBRP) has led to non-fulfilment of the objective of the project—mobility of Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) to dominate sensitive border effectively.The CAG observed that the ministry of home affairs had approved the INBR project in November 2010 to construct roads of strategic importance along the Indo- Nepal border by March 2016. The SSB was to be benefitted from the project with effective mobility of the troops to dominate the sensitive borders. The UPPWD, the executing agency, was responsible to complete the project in its entirety.The CAG report on general and social sector for the year ending March 31, 2019, was tabled by UP parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna in the state legislative assembly on August 19.In Uttar Pradesh, the UPPWD was implementing the project. The initial alignment of 640 km INB road in the state was revised to 574.59 km, including 257.02 km under 12 sanctioned detailed project reports (DPRs), after a survey. The remaining 16 DPRs for 317.57 km road were yet to be sanctioned as of December 2019. During 2012-20 (upto December 2019) , UPPWD incurred an expenditure of ₹834.50 crore on implementation of the project, the CAG report said.The role of the UPPWD in implementation of the scheme was found to be below par. Even after eight years from the commencement of the project, the DPRs of 56% alignment for the INBR in UP was yet to be approved by central government. The UPPWD had not submitted the revised alignment and forest clearances for these stretches of roads were yet to be obtained, the report added.Even for the 252 km stretches sanctioned by the central government, only 132.64 km (52%) of the sanctioned road length could be completed till December 2019, the CAG observed.The failure of UPPWD in getting the site cleared for construction coupled with acquisition of land at a snail’s pace and delays in forest clearance caused massive delays of 16 to 66 months beyond the stipulated dates for completion of contracts. This led to 42% increase in the construction cost and 164% increase in cost of land acquisition. The SSB border outposts (BOPs) situated off the constructed roads were left without connectivity despite central government covenants to provide connectivity through link roads.The CAG noticed that contract management of road construction was opaque and deficient. Financial bids were opened prior to technical sanction. There were inordinate delays in execution of contracts. Execution of the project was marred by delays in recovery of advances and considerable amounts remained pending. Quality control and monitoring were without requisite oversight by the authorities responsible leading to the possibility of sub- standard construction works on a project of strategic importance.The inadmissible expenditure was incurred from funds provided by the central government due to lack of clarity on the terms and conditions for implementation of the scheme since MoU between the centre and the state government was not finalised, the CAG stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/anomalies-in-indo-nepal-border-road-construction-hit-ssb-mobility-cag-101629822011906.html

24-08-2021||Lucknow||Across UP, it’s back to school for Classes 6 to 8||Schools across UP resumed classroom teaching for Classes 6 to 8 with thin to moderate attendance, on Tuesday. Wearing a face shield and masks, students walked excitedly into school premises after a prolonged closure of nearly six months, following the outbreak of the pandemic.According to state government directives, teaching in schools for Classes 1 to 5 is scheduled to begin from September 1.In several government schools, staff welcomed the students with flowers and applied tilak on their forehead. Akansha, a teacher of Purva Midhyamik Vidyalaya, Gautam Buddha Nagar, said, “The enthusiasm among students was a welcome sign.”“I missed school because we had a lot of fun with our friends. We met today after such a long time. It was also a joy meeting our teachers in person. I also feel that physical classes are much more effective than online ones,” said Sunaina Agarwal, a Class 6 student of a private school in Lucknow.School administrations across the state had made elaborate arrangements for social distancing, thermal scanning etc as students returned to the campus. Schools did away with refreshment breaks, PT classes and held classes in two shifts, as per state government guidelines.At St Joseph School, a sanitisation tunnel was set up at the entrance to ensure safety of students, said Anil Agarwal of the school, who is also the president of the Unaided Private School Association.“We have vaccinated a majority of our staff and aim to vaccinate all by the end of this month. We are also urging parents to get vaccinated. Besides, we are also following all Covid-19 protocols as mandated by the government,” said Meenakshi Bahadur, principal, Study Hall.At City Montessori School (CMS) 10,121 out of 12,690 students attended physical classes on Tuesday. CMS founder Jagdish Gandhi welcomed the government’s decision to reopen schools. “The decision to reopen schools for classes 6 to 8 is a welcome move. The students looked excited. We ensured strict Covid-19 protocols on our campuses to allay concerns of parents. We are also holding classes in two shifts to avoid crowding as per government’s orders,” said Gandhi.At Rani Laxmi Bai Memorial School, Lucknow, nearly 75% students attended school. The attendance in Classes 7 and 8 was near 90%, according to the school management.In sharp contrast, attendance was quite thin at La Martiniere College. Principal Carlyle McFarland said that only 62 students of 1,100 from classes 6 to 8 reached the school for classes.While most school administrations are hopeful that attendance of students will pick up in the coming days, a few city schools have not resumed physical classes at all due to concerns of parents. La Martiniere Girls’ College remained closed for physical classes as most parents declined to send their wards to school.Delhi Public School Shaheedpath also remained closed. “We have not started physical classes for classes for 6 to 8 as most parents refused to send their children. We are going ahead with online classes,” said Principal Manju Lakhanpal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/across-up-it-s-back-to-school-for-classes-6-to-8-101629821224855.html

She was also crying while urinating recently. I talked to her and she opened up and informed me about the entire episode. We decided to lodge a complaint against the music teacher. But before that, we wanted to talk to the teacher who admitted his crime. He offered us money and asked to keep this a secret,” the mother said. “We trusted the person because he is an aged man and also a music teacher. He not only physically assaulted my child but also traumatized her mentally by constantly threatening her. As a mother, I don’t want this to happen to any other child, we demand strong action against the person,” she added.Officer in-charge of Rongpur Police Patrol Post, Barsha Borgohain, confirmed receiving an FIR lodged by the mother and immediately arrested the accused from his home. “This is a sensitive matter and we are investigating it thoroughly.

24-08-2021||Lucknow||BJP to carry on Kalyan’s legacy for OBC-Hindutva connect||LUCKNOW After announcing roads named after Kalyan Singh in various parts of UP, the ruling BJP is now mulling naming various schemes after the party’s tallest OBC leader in the state who formed a heady cocktail of backward politics and Hindutva to head the first BJP government in UP in 1991. The Yogi Adityanath government and the state BJP unit are expected to unveil various initiatives aimed at building on Kalyan’s twin OBC-Hindutva connect ahead of the 2022 UP polls. “OBCs are expected to play a big role in 2022 UP polls. Up against mainly the Samajwadi Party, which also commands loyalty among OBCs, the BJP could well look to play up the party’s association with their own big OBC name - Kalyan Singh,” said Prof Manuka Khanna, head of political science department at Lucknow University. A proposal to name Aligarh airport after the late leader could be put up before chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s cabinet and an ‘Asthi Kalash’ Yatra (a journey with urns containing ashes of the departed soul) across the state is also said to be in the works. It is learnt that preparations were underway to immerse Kalyan’s ashes in major rivers of UP, including Ganga in Varanasi and Saryu in Ayodhya. The ashes would be gathered from the banks of Ganga at Narora, some party leaders indicated. Shraddhanjali sabhas (memorial meetings) too would be organised across the state, they said.Kalyan Singh breathed his last after a long illness at Lucknow’s SGPGI on Saturday at 9.15pm. Since his demise, the BJP’s top leadership at the centre and in the state – from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who escorted Kalyan’s mortal remains everywhere for three days – paid glowing tributes to the departed leader who despite his brief fling with the Samajwadi Party, was a “RSS favourite.” Modi had referred to Kalyan Singh’s name and said the late leader lived up to his name. Kalyan is a Hindi word, meaning ‘welfare’ and in the run up to the 2022 UP polls, several schemes or initiatives with Jan ‘Kalyan’ (people’s welfare) written over them are expected to be announced, party leaders confirmed. “We are working on that (naming schemes and projects after the late leader),” a UP minister admitted, adding that the late leader’s name and the meaning it carried were such that it could fit into “virtually anything that we undertake.” Numerically, OBCs are the biggest voting group in the state and that is why in an election year the BJP is planning to connect with OBCs in Kalyan’s name, opined political experts. Kalyan Singh who belonged to the Lodh sub-caste of OBCs was handpicked by RSS veteran late Bhaurao Deoras to head the UP BJP unit in 1984 and subsequently tasked with countering the ‘Mandal’ (caste) agitation with ‘kamandal’ by taking up the issue of temple at Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya. The BJP has only recently promoted young Rajya Sabha MP BL Verma, a protégé of Kalyan as the union minister of state who was tasked with carrying out one of the seven ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatras’ in the state. On Tuesday, the BJP’s OBC leaders targeted Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, an OBC too, for not visiting personally to bid adieu to the “biggest OBC leader.” These included state’s labour minister Swami Prasad Maurya, BJP’s Lok Sabha MP from Unnao, Swami Sachidanand Hari Sakshi Maharaj, better known as just Sakshi Maharaj, a Lodh. Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, BJP’s OBC face in UP – who announced plan to name several roads in the state after Kalyan Singh, agreed. “We may have ideological differences in politics but there are some common courtesies which SP and even Congress didn’t care to show. That’s pathetic,” said Maurya. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh, who too is an OBC, targeted the SP chief too. “He couldn’t travel barely a kilometer to pay tribute to the biggest backward leader. Is it due to vote bank concerns,” the state BJP chief asked. Akhilesh Yadav had conveyed his condolences on the demise of Kalyan Singh describing him as a “great administrator” who would be missed. BSP chief Mayawati had visited the Mall Avenue residence of Kalyan Singh’s grandson Sandip to pay her last respects to the departed soul. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi, defence minister Rajnath and BJP chief JP Nadda flew down to Lucknow to pay respects to the departed leader, union home minister Amit Shah along with other union ministers and chief ministers of various BJP ruled states was present when the last rites of late leader were performed on the banks Ganga at Narora, Bulandshahr on Monday. Kalyan’s mortal remains were placed at the Vidhan Bhawan, UP BJP office and subsequently taken to Aligarh where they were placed in a stadium to let his supporters pay their respects. They were also taken to Atrauli before the last rites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-to-carry-on-kalyan-s-legacy-for-obc-hindutva-connect-101629819303899.html

Appreciating Gathwala Khap, Tikait said that this Khap always stood with farmers. “They are brave. Land is mother and identity of farmers and they will lose their identity if deprived of their land,” he said.

Under this programme, the NER has decided to give a massive facelift to the train for a better journeying experience to the passengers. “The train is a popular one, especially for the Mumbai -bound passengers. Hence, it has been decided to give a better journeying experience to the passengers by giving it a massive facelift,” said Pankaj Kumar Singh, chief public relations officer (CPRO), NER. Under the modernisation, NER officials said the old conventional coaches of the train would be replaced with plush Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches, based on German technique. The coaches are designed to offer more comfort to the passengers boarding the train. These coaches were earlier only restricted to high-end trains like Swarna Shatabdi, Garib Rath and series of Rajdhanis that were known for comfort. “But now, the passengers travelling in Pushpak Express too can experience the comfort of LHB coaches,” an officer said. Officials also termed the swanky coaches as the most comfortable. “Unlike regular coaches, LHBs are jerk -proof and have high quality build that make them sophisticated and of course comfortable,” an officer said. Singh said there would be one SLDRD coach, two general coaches, five sleeper coaches, four 3rd AC coaches, two 3 tier coaches economy, one coach of second AC and one coach of first AC, one pantry car and one generator car\luggage. There would be 18 coaches in total. He said that the newer version of Pushpak Express Special train (02533/02534) would start from October 30.

BJP district general secretary Vikas Tiwari said that due permission has been taken by the party district unit whenever they put up hoardings and banners, ensuring maximum are put up at authorised display sites. While Congress leader Satpal Brahmachari said that many times party workers from their own side put hoardings having faces of senior leaders but they should also ensure proper permission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/poster-war-rages-between-aap-bjp-govt-in-uttarakhand-101629815885202.html
24-08-2021||Mumbai||Nadda calls Rane’s arrest ‘unconstitutional’; Sena expresses faith in police||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders on Tuesday condemned the arrest of Union minister Narayan Rane. Rane was arrested in Ratnagiri’s Sangameshwar for allegedly insulting Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Rane claimed that Thackeray forgot the year of India’s independence during his speech on August 15. Rane made the remarks on Monday during his Jan Ashirwad Yatra rally.Meanwhile, BJP chief JP Nadda condemned the arrest of the minister and called it ‘unconstitutional’. He said that the BJP will not be scared despite the arrest and called it a reaction to the ‘support the newly inducted Cabinet ministers were getting in the Jan Ashirwad Yatra’.“The arrest of Union Minister Narayan Rane ji by the Maharashtra government is a violation of constitutional values. We will neither be scared nor be suppressed by any such action. These people are troubled by the immense support the BJP is getting in the Jan-Aashirvad Yatra. We will continue to fight democratically. The journey will continue,” Nadda said on Twitter.BJP leader Prasad Lad alleged that the minister was ‘manhandled’ by the police. Another BJP leader Pramod Jathar earlier claimed that the Ratnagiri police officials were ‘under tremendous pressure’ to arrest Rane. “Rane was arrested while he was having lunch. The arrest is illegal. We are afraid that he may be harassed by the police if kept inside the police station overnight. He was manhandled by police while he was having his lunch. The cops did not even allow doctors to complete his check up,” Lad said.The Shiv Sena defended the action of the cops. Sena MP Vinayak Raut said that Rane’s actions would have caused unrest and disrupt the law-and-order situation in the state. “We have faith in the Maharashtra police and they have arrested Rane as he was trying to disrupt the law-and-order situation in the state,” Raut said.Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar also condemned the statement made by Rane and held a protest against the minister. She said that Rane should not have made such remarks as Rane himself was the chief minister of Maharashtra once. Rane’s comments also led to fights between the cadres of the BJP and the Shiv Sena in Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nadda-calls-rane-s-arrest-unconstitutional-sena-expresses-faith-in-police-101629808524615.html
24-08-2021||Dehradun||Chaos in Uttarakhand assembly over issuing of caste certificates||The second day of the ongoing monsoon session in Uttarakhand Assembly witnessed chaos following a heated debate on the issue of irregularities in issuing caste certificates by the revenue department to people belonging to scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribe (ST) and Other Backward Class (OBC) in the state. The issue was raised by Opposition MLAs Mamta Rakesh and Qazi Nizamuddin from Haridwar after the Question Hour in the House. Raising the issue, Rakesh alleged that the people of the state “are facing practical issues in getting their caste certificates from the revenue department as the authorities concerned are asking for documents to prove their permanent residency dated 1985 or before that.” “It is a totally impractical demand as many people don’t have those documents dated 1985 or before that. Due to this, they are not able to get their caste certificates and thus failing to avail the benefit of at least 14 welfare programmes being run by the social welfare department of state,” said Rakesh, demanding the government to simplify the process. Continuing the attack on the government, MLA Nizamuddin said the “government has made 1985 as the base year for documents of permanent residency in the state which should be changed to November 9, 2000, when the state was formed out of Uttar Pradesh.” “The base should be made November 9, 2000, as it was the date of state’s formation and before that, we were in Uttar Pradesh. Hence, asking the people to show documents dating 1985 makes absolutely no sense. The government should simplify the process by making the base year 2000 and not 1985,” said Nizamuddin. Speaking on the issue, he also cited a committee formed in the issue under former parliamentary affairs minister Madan Kaushik a few years ago which “too said that the base year should be 2000 for getting the caste certificates.” “But even after the committee’s recommendation, people are asked to show documents dating 1985 or older to prove their permanent residency,” Nizamuddin said. The two MLAs were soon joined by the Leader of Opposition Pritam Singh who, while terming the issue a “very serious one”, said the demand for documents dating 1985 or older is unnecessary making the process difficult for a large section of people in the state. Because of that, they are not able to get their caste certificates. Government should immediately make 2000 as the base year.” Replying in the House, revenue minister Subodh Uniyal, while citing the reason behind making 1985 as the base year for caste certificates, turned the gun at the Opposition and said, “The definition of permanent residency in Uttarakhand was decided by your (Congress) government in 2013 which said any person living in Uttarakhand for at least 15 years before the formation of the state in 2000 would be considered a permanent resident who is eligible for getting caste certificate.” “We are just following that definition on permanent residency on issuing caste certificates. So blaming us for the issue won’t help,” said Uniyal. Amid the heated debate between the Opposition MLAs and the minister, ruling party MLA from Haridwar Deshraj Karnwal said that the Uttarakhand high court, in an order in 2013 on the issue, had already said that, “Those born after 2000 or before that in the state would be included in the definition of a permanent resident to get caste certificate.” “The governments in all these years didn’t take any action even after the high court order. The concerned department official passed an order on the same in 2020, but it is stuck in the department of revenue with no implementation till date,” said Karnwal. With his statement, the Opposition became aggressive, saying their own MLA “exposed” them on the issue. Led by the Leader of Opposition Singh, they also resorted to raising slogans against the government amid requests by the Speaker to get back to their place, which they did after some time. Later, minister of parliamentary affairs Bansidhar Bhagat said, “The government will take necessary action on the same to simplify the process for people.” During the day, the Opposition also raised the issue of the formation of four new districts citing the announcement made by the BJP government in 2011 with no action on it to date. Opposition MLA from Ranikhet constituency, Karan Mahara raised the issue saying, “The BJP government in 2011 had announced four new districts in the state namely Ranikhet, Kotdwar, Didihat and Yamunotri but nothing has been happening on the issue since then.” “Almost after a decade, the government did nothing to implement the announcement on the ground which would have helped in the development of those areas. This just proves that it was just a political move to affect the 2012 polls which they lost. But after coming back to power in 2017, they haven’t done anything yet because they don’t have any intentions for it,” said Mahara. “The government should now decide on the district headquarters and other aspects of the four proposed districts which would help the development of those areas,” he added. Minister Bhagat, while replying to the House on the issue, blamed the Opposition for not taking any step on the same when it was in power from 2012-2017. “We had made a committee to decide on the area marking and other required processes in 2011 after the announcement but unfortunately, we lost the elections in 2012. But the question is what did they do in five years of being in power from 2012-17? Nothing. And now they are blaming us or making hollow political promises which, in fact, they themselves are doing with months left for the next assembly elections,” said Bhagat while adding, “However, we are a responsible government and will take necessary actions on it.” Earlier, when the day commenced, the Opposition demanded a debate on the Covid-19 pandemic, saying “the pandemic isn’t over yet with new cases coming daily and no visible preparation by the government to handle the expected third wave.” Speaker Premchand Aggarwal then assured a debate post-lunch session during which the government informed the House on the preparations for the third wave including additional ICU beds in hospitals and speeding up inoculation drive against Covid-19 in the state. .....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/chaos-in-uttarakhand-assembly-over-issuing-of-caste-certificates-101629807582987.html

24-08-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: Is Pune ready for a citizens’ assembly on climate change?||Government leaders will meet in Glasgow, UK in November for the 26th UN Climate Change Conference. They have been meeting regularly since 1995. Several solutions have been developed and implemented. Yet, the IPCC has signalled a Code Red for Humanity.What if it was not only political leaders who were making the decisions? What if ordinary citizens like us had a chance to address our climate and ecological emergency?This is happening through a “Global Citizens’ Assembly” of people from around the world to deliberate about responses to climate change and to inform the UN talks in Glasgow. The citizens’ assembly aims to accelerate action to address the climate and ecological emergency in ways that citizens see fit. The premise of the Global Assembly (https://globalassembly.org/) is simple: everyone on earth has a role to play in addressing the climate and ecological emergency. At the heart of the Global Assembly will be 100 participants, a snapshot of the world’s population broken down by gender, age and socio-economic background, and chosen by lottery.The first step in selecting these 100 participants was identifying 100 points on the earth by lottery, based on the distribution of human population density across the globe. Eighteen points were identified in India, in J&K, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.In the next three to four weeks, one individual from each of these 18 locations would be identified through another lottery process to participate in the core Global Citizens’ Assembly. Local support organisations at, or close to these locations, would support the 100 citizen delegates in their participation in the Global Assembly by providing stable internet connectivity, a computer and translation facilities. The hosts will also provide an information pack on climate change and key questions and issues of deliberation in the participants’ local language and social context in text and audio forms.Such citizens’ assemblies with ordinary people as delegates have been organised on various civic issues in other countries for some years now. Topics have included waste management in Brazil, constitutional reform in Ireland, climate policies in UK and France, municipal budgets in Australia, flood and management in Poland, among others. Since the participants are ordinary citizens, they do not have the compulsions that politicians might have and co-could generate more ambitious action plans.Raashi Saxena, a young person from Bengaluru and part of the Global Assembly organisers’ international team at i4Policy, says, “the Global Assembly provides a unique opportunity to harness our collective intelligence by synthesising the best knowledge evidence into effective action, creating a global picture of local action plans. Through collaborations, we want to overcome polarisation by creating deep respect between people who disagree, creating a new movement of people with a shared desire to work together to tackle climate change.”The Global Assembly on Climate Change will convene from September to December. It will make recommendations to COP26 and get an official response from the UN’s COP26 process. This Global Assembly is also directly supported by the Scottish government. The design of the assembly is an ongoing collaborative effort between citizens, institutions, climate scientists, social movements and citizen participation practitioners.The GA process is encouraging and connecting with citizens groups, artists and media for multiple local community or global events that anyone can run or join, to explore the scale of the climate emergency and respond effectively. The hope is that large numbers of people would join globally to take action on climate emergency. Is Pune ready for a citizens’ assembly on climate change with delegates selected by lottery?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/civic-sanskriti-is-pune-ready-for-a-citizens-assembly-on-climate-change-101629801632050.html
24-08-2021||Chandigarh||People, places and libraries open to world of goodness||The library is an arena of possibilities; it opens both a window into the soul and a door onto the world. –Rita Dove, American poet Public libraries are not the spots on the itinerary while visiting tourist destinations. But whenever I go on a trip, I make it a point to check on the public library of the place. Often it reveals much more and tells many stories than the shining malls and magnificent buildings. One of the most charming and rich libraries that I visited was in Agatti, an island spread over 3.2sqkm, in Lakshadweep. It was situated in a quaint building around the street corner. One has to leave one’s footwear outside on the street to enter the library. I went there to spend some time before heading for the hotel, thinking that it would be a tiny official collection but soon I realised that I could spend hours in this paradise of books on the tiny slice of land in the midst of the Arabian Sea. It was a treasure trove of books, new and old, classics and contemporary. Common citizens of all ages were busy reading books, magazines and newspapers which have travelled a long way across the sea to open for them a window to the world from which they were geographically cut off. That such a small community of 8,000 individuals invested in a library was a telling comment on Agatti’s residents. Thornhill Mayne Memorial Library at Alfred Park in Allahabad is another library that I cherished visiting, not only because of its Scottish Baronial Revival architecture, but because of the hordes of readers sitting inside and even outside the library building, deeply immersed in their studies. It suited the epithet, Temple of Knowledge, as there was a sombre air of purpose all around, with thousands of books standing guard for the precious wealth that they were holding inside, and students poring over them as dedicated devotees. Allahabad, a city of educated people, is known for producing civil servants; the library, I could see was an extension of its desires and aspirations. But the library for which I have a special place in my heart is the library of my childhood, the District Library at Chamba in Himachal Pradesh, located in the Akhand Chandi Palace, once the abode of the royalty. The library is in a huge pillar-less Darbar Hall with large windows with grand views of the valley. The majestic architecture enhanced the settings and provided dignity to rows of glass panel cabinets containing books of all forms and sizes. I remember the feeling of awe I felt every time I entered its portals after signing the register at the entrance. The librarian, a beautiful and kind lady, sat under a stained-glass window. With her large key ring holding keys to all bookshelves, to my child’s eyes, she was the embodiment of splendour and power, the queen of the library. The grandest part of the palace was made to house a public library instead of the office of some important government official. It was an indicator of what the community thought was important for its welfare: Investment in ideas, collected wisdom and access to the goodness of the world. jayantiduttaroy@yahoo.co.in The writer is a faculty member at Panjab University, Chandigarh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/people-places-and-libraries-open-to-world-of-goodness-101629801391858.html
24-08-2021||Chandigarh||4 Punjab ministers rebel against Capt Amarinder||Four cabinet ministers and several MLAs on Tuesday declared open rebellion against chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, expressing their total “lack of faith” in him. Cabinet ministers Tript Rajinder Bajwa, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Charanjit Singh Channi and Sukhbinder Sarkaria, Punjab Congress general secretary (organisation) Pargat Singh and around two dozen legislators, who met at Bajwa’s official residence in Chandigarh, declared that they do not have faith in the chief minister’s ability to fulfil the pending election promises, indirectly pushing for his replacement. Also read: Modi, Putin hold ‘detailed conversation’ on situation in Afghanistan“We have lost faith in him (Amarinder), but changing the CM is the prerogative of the party high command,” Randhawa told reporters after the meeting. Five-member delegation to meet Sonia The disgruntled leaders also authorised a five-member delegation, including four cabinet ministers and Pargat, all known detractors of Amarinder, to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi and apprise her of their sentiment at the earliest. Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, the most strident critic of the chief minister, was not present at the meeting. However, the four ministers and Pargat, who declined to disclose the number of MLAs at the meeting, will have a discussion with him before leaving for Delhi to meet the central leaders. The detractors’ meeting came as Sidhu was feeling the heat over his advisers’ controversial remarks over Kashmir and Pakistan. The Congress has 80 MLAs in Punjab. After the meeting, Channi told reporters that the MLAs who assembled in Chandigarh were worried over the unfulfilled poll promises made by the Congress before the 2017 assembly elections. “A lot of promises have been fulfilled, but those promises (the implementation of) which may lead to friction with the opposition remain unfulfilled,” he said. He said that the issues were not getting resolved the way the Congress wanted, and they had been promised. “We no longer trust that these issues will be resolved. Therefore, we are seeking time from the party high command for a meeting, and we will meet them and put forth our issues so that Punjab’s issues can be resolved,” said Channi, flanked by Randhawa, Bajwa and Pargat. Capt camp hits back, wants action against Sidhu advisers Amid rebellion by four ministers and several MLAs who have been supporting Sidhu, a group of cabinet ministers and MLAs called for strong action against the state Congress president’s advisers Malwinder Singh Mali and Pyare Lal Garg for their “patently anti-national and pro-Pak comments”. “The statements of both these newly appointed advisers of Punjab Congress president Navjot Sidhu were clearly against India’s interests, and detrimental to national security,” said cabinet ministers Brahm Mohindra, Vijay Inder Singla, Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Balbir Singh Sidhu and Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, along with MLA Raj Kumar Verka in a statement. Besides stringent legal action against Mali and Garg, they also urged the Congress national leadership to direct Sidhu to immediately rein in his aides in the interest of the party, and the country. “The Congress has made many sacrifices for the protection of the nation’s security and peace, as have our soldiers at the borders. Nobody can or should be allowed to undermine these sacrifices and jeopardise the safety of our country and its people,” they emphasised, citing, in particular, the grave implications such statements could have for the border state of Punjab. The Congress leaders also questioned Sidhu’s failure to put his foot down on such “anti-national and pro-Pak diatribe” by his aides, despite the justified uproar it has triggered across party lines. Sidhu’s omission in this regard had given ammunition to the opposition parties, which were quick to recall the PPCC president’s own bonhomie with the Pakistan Prime Minister and army chief, they pointed out, warning against the massive damage this could cause to the Congress in the run-up to the 2022 Punjab elections, which are due in less than six months. They termed Mali’s statement on Kashmir a dangerous and unacceptable deviation from India’s stated position on J&K. By questioning the unanimous 1994 resolution of Parliament, declaring Jammu & Kashmir an integral of India (which was reiterated in 2012), Mali had blatantly toed the line of Pakistan, which had been trying to stake claim to the region and was in illegal occupation of certain areas, such as PoK, they added. Even Garg’s statement countering chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s criticism of Pakistan reflected his pro-Pak leanings, they said, adding that anyone not condemning the continuous efforts from across the border to destabilise Punjab and India was playing into the hands of the enemy. “Drones from Pakistan are dumping arms and drugs into Punjab almost every day. Our soldiers are dying at the border. How can any patriotic Indian not condemn Pak actions in the circumstances?” they asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/4-punjab-ministers-rebel-against-capt-amarinder-101629800131350.html
24-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi drains need design change, says CM Kejriwal at review meeting||Drains in Delhi will have to undergo design changes in accordance with suggestions of an expert team from IIT-Delhi to ensure smooth flow of water during and after heavy rains, said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal after chairing a review meeting on Delhi Drainage Masterplan on Tuesday.“Today CM Arvind Kejriwal chaired a review meeting on Delhi’s drainage masterplan. Design changes will be introduced in drains in accordance with recommendations of IIT. The focus will be to enable smooth flow of water during and after heavy rains. Waterlogging issues be resolved,” said a tweet from the CM’s office after the meeting.The meeting was attended by water minister Satyendar Jain, vice-chairperson of Delhi Jal Board Raghav Chadha and chief secretary Vijay Dev.Also Read | DU decides to implement NEP from 2022-23, triggers rowCiting presentations made during the meeting, a senior government official who attended the meeting said, “The problems were broadly summarised as stormwater drains being used for sewage; most of these stormwater drains not letting water flow freely because they are blocked with waste; Network of streams, natural and seasonal water bodies, and urban stormwater channels have either disappeared, encroached or blocked severely with waste; Delhi’s groundwater recharging area reducing drastically; and engineering flaws in current models.”The review meeting was held three days after the national Capital was brought to its knees by six hours of rainfall, throwing traffic into disarray and inundating several key stretches and underpasses, exposing how badly it needs a comprehensive drainage plan as well as one to ensure that local drains are cleaned ahead of monsoon.On July 19,Kejriwal announced that the Delhi administration will redesign the city’s drainage system and identify waterlogging hot spots so that area-specific interventions can be made to ensure smooth flow of traffic. The announcement came the day a man drowned in the submerged Pul Prahladpur underpass -- one of the perennial problem points -- and at least 39 key road stretches were flooded after heavy rain. The last drainage master plan was drafted by the Delhi administration in 1976. To be sure, Delhi was administered by a metropolitan council between 1966 and 1990. In 2016, the Delhi government commissioned a study of the city’s drainage system by IIT-Delhi. Following the study, a drainage master plan was compiled which also pointed out that the city had no single agency to manage and maintain drainage. However, the plan could not be implemented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-drains-need-design-change-says-cm-kejriwal-at-review-meeting-101629796891059.html

He later surrendered to the police.Those killed also included the tenant, his wife and one of his two minor daughters. The other girl was injured but survived the murderous assault, and her account was likely to be critical to police’s reconstruction of the incident in the building, owned by the suspect, between 2 am and 5 am on Tuesday.“Prima facie evidence suggests the suspect bolted all the doors of the house and murdered four people with a knife while they were sleeping on different floors of the building, owned by the suspect,” said Deepak Saharan, deputy commissioner of police, adding that a probe is underway to establish if anyone else was involved in the gruesome murders.The suspect lived in a three-storey building with his wife, son, and daughter-in-law.Saharan said a team from Rajendra Park police station reached the spot and recovered bodies. “One minor girl, who had suffered grave injuries, was sent to hospital and is reported to be critical. Other bodies have been sent for post-mortem. We are questioning Singh, his wife, and son who were present in the building at the time of the incident,” he said.Singh surrendered himself before the Rajendra Park police station around 6 am on Tuesday and confessed to the killings, said police.Saharan said preliminary investigation revealed that Singh suspected his daughter-in-law of having an illicit relationship with the tenant. “First, he murdered Sunita Yadav who was sleeping on the first floor and then went to the second floor and killed three tenants with a sharp weapon. A minor daughter of the tenant who was also attacked, survived,” he said.The neighbours claimed that Singh was depressed for the last few months owing to issues related to his daughter-in-law.“Initial inquiry suggests there was no trouble within the family apart from the issue of the daughter-in-law and the tenant,” said Saharan.A case under section 302 (murder) will be registered once the initial investigation is over, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-man-allegedly-kills-four-including-daughter-in-law-surrenders-101629796711378.html

24-08-2021||Mumbai||Union minister Rane arrested over his Thackeray slap comment||Union minister Narayan Rane was arrested on Tuesday after three cases were filed against him for his comments a day earlier that he wanted to “give a tight slap” to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for allegedly forgetting the year of India’s independence during a speech. The arrest came as ruling Shiv Sena workers took to the streets across the state, put up posters against Rane, and slapped them at Pune’s Deccan Gymkhana area with footwear. Sena workers vandalised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) office In Amravati and set the party’s posters on fire. Security was enhanced outside Rane’s residence in Mumbai even as BJP workers gathered there in his support.Rane was taken into custody in Ratnagiri district, where he was travelling as part of tours the ministers inducted into the Union council ministers in July are conducting across the country. The tours were announced after Prime Minister Narendra Modi could not introduce the ministers in Parliament last month due to Opposition protests. Rane, who was taken to a police station, complained of high blood pressure and sugar levels and a doctor was called to examine him, PTI reported.The Bombay high court earlier on Tuesday rejected a plea for an urgent hearing of Rane’s anticipatory bail application as he faced arrest for his comments.Rane moved the court as Nashik Police Commissioner Deepak Pandey on Tuesday said he has ordered the formation of a team to arrest the minister and to produce him before a court. Three cases, including under India Penal Code’s sections 500 (defamation), 505(2) (mischief), 153-B (1)(c) (remarks likely to cause disharmony, or feeling of enmity or hatred or ill will), have been filed against Rane for the comments.A sessions court in Ratnagiri earlier refused to hear Rane’s anticipatory bail plea.A high court bench of justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar directed Rane’s lawyer, Aniket Nikam, to follow due procedure before approaching it. A separate application has also been filed for quashing the three cases registered against Rane in Nashik, Pune and Mahad.Nikam approached the court after its lunch break concluded at 2.30 pm and mentioned the two applications seeking anticipatory bail and quashing of the cases. The court asked Nikam to follow the procedure under the law by filing a praecipe to get the matter listed for hearing. Nikam also sought protection from coercive action including arrest pending hearing of the plea.Nikam said for arrest for any offence which involves punishment of under 7 years, police have to issue a notice. He added this has not been issued in Rane’s case and hence the order for his arrest is illegal. Pandey said they were following the rule book and the arrest order was issued as per the legal provisions. “We have followed legal provisions and will ensure that privileges of the parliamentarian are protected. Since, the Union minister is member of Rajya Sabha, we are bound to intimate chairman of the upper House in due course after the arrest.”Hours before his arrest, Rane, who has been a bitter critic of Thackeray since he was expelled from Shiv Sena in 2005, maintained he has not violated any law. “I said had I been there, I would have slapped him for his ignorance of the year of Independence. I did not say that I would slap him. I know the legal provisions. I have not received any legal notice for the arrest and would not speak on the basis of media report. In fact, I will take action against media for false reports,” he said. Rane questioned why action was not taken against Thackeray for his similar statements. He did not elaborate.Rane’s son, Nitesh, threatened a “befitting reply” if any action was taken against his father.Maharashtra’s BJP chief, Chandrakant Patil, said they would not justify Rane’s remarks and added that the Union minister’s style is similar to the Thackerays and other Shiv Sena leaders. He added arrest cannot be the response to his comments. Patil said Union ministers, president, vice president and prime minister have protection from arrest. “The state authorities which have been given the arrest orders should be aware of it. We do not justify the statement by Rane. He should have been given warning for his statement.”Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis criticised Pandey for issuing the arrest order while accusing the government of “misusing” the police force. “This would have been a non-cognisable offence. However, Nashik CP (Pandey) thinks he is above everyone. The way he has given directions of Rane’s arrest suggest his actions are motivated.”Rane on Monday claimed Thackeray checked the year with his aides midway during the speech and called it shameful the chief minister “does not know” the year of independence. “He leaned back to inquire...during his speech. Had I been there, I would have given him a tight slap,” Rane told reporters in Raigad.The Shiv Sena on Monday hit out at Rane for his comments saying he has lost his mental balance. “Rane was inducted in the (Union) Cabinet just to attack the Shiv Sena, and while doing his job, he stooped to a new low,” said Shiv Sena Member of Parliament Vinayak Raut. Raut has written to Modi seeking Rane’s removal from his Cabinet. “The Jan Ashirwad Yatra was meant to take the blessing of the people and it was a brainchild of Prime Minister. Rane has given a wrong turn to it. He has used derogatory and objectionable language against Thackery who holds a constitutional post. I have requested the removal of Rane from his Cabinet to uphold the sanctity of constitutional structure.”Shiv Sena parted ways with its three-decade old ally, BJP, and formed the government in Maharashtra with Nationalist Congress Party and Congress in November 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nashik-police-chief-orders-formation-of-team-to-arrest-rane-over-slap-comment-101629789031282.html

The former Shiv Sena chief minister, who was made a Union minister recently, hit out at Thackeray claiming the latter forgot the year of independence during his August 15 address to the people of the state and had he been present at the spot, he would have slapped him.A Yuva Sena leader said the protests were happening on their own and the “angry” activists were not asked to come to the agitation sites.“We did not call anyone but Yuva Sena activists are angry over insulting remarks made by Narayan Sena and came on their own. We will show our strength to him,” said Yuva Sena functionary Varun Sardesai.Speaking to reporters later, Sardesai said Yuva Sena activists were ready to face the baton for the Sena supremo. “Uddhav Thackeray is our god and if anyone dares to insult him, we will not care about the law and order,” said Sardesai.“We have come at his (Narayan Rane’s) house and if he has guts let him face us,” he added.In Thane, youth wing activists staged an agitation against Rane near Mantel Hospital following which workers of the two camps indulged in stone pelting.Activists also vandalised a two-wheeler of Rane’s supporter.

The movement of trains between the Howrah-Patna rail section had to be stopped that day for two hours due to the threat, leaving several trains on the busy route stranded at different stations. The suspected Maoists, arrested in this case, have been identified as Bhairav Yadav alias Gehuman and his associates Sunil Yadav. Jamui superintendent of police (SP) Pramod Kumar Mandal said a police team led by sub divisional police officer (SDPO) Dr Rakesh Kumar raided Chhedlahi village under Giddhaur police station in the district and arrested Bhairav following a tip-off about the presence of Maoists.During interrogation, Bhairav led police to Sunil, who was arrested from Ramakuraon village in the same district apart from recovery of explosives, bomb making material including gel, electric wires, mobile phones, batteries, detonators and Maoist literature. Police later found that Sunil and Bhairav were recently released from Sheikhpura jail after serving time as convicted Maoists. “It came to light that the plan to [blow up the railway halt] was hatched inside the Sheikhpura district jail by Sunil, Bhairav and former Maoist commander Surang Yadav. Surang Yadav had surrendered on July 16, 2017 at Charka Patthar police station in Jamui and was shifted to Sheikhpura jail in 2019 for security reasons,” said Jamui police chief. He added that Sunil paid ₹5000 to Bhairav asking him to issue the threat to the station master of Chaura Halt. Following Bhairav’s threat to blow up the station on July 31, the station master reported it to higher authorities, leading to suspension of train services on the route between 3:45 am to 5:15 am. Authorities had then registered a case against an unknown person, but no arrests had been made till Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/2-maoists-held-for-threatening-to-blow-up-railway-station-in-bihar-101629784891136.html

One of the morning walkers ended up losing ₹9.5 lakh, which the thieves withdrew from his bank account in 68 transactions within an hour of stealing his debit and credit cards along with his mobile phone from his car.“I had parked my car on the service road near Jogeshwari-Vikhroli Link Road (JVLR) junction at Vikhroli East, near a police chowki [post], which is considered as the safest place [to park],” said Dr Aparna Govind, a Powai resident, whose car was among those broken into.Several other residents from Mulund, Ghatkopar, Bhandup, Kanjurmarg, Vikhroli and Powai park their cars on the service road and go for a morning walk while leaving their valuables in the car.“We keep our phones and wallets in cars as it’s impossible to walk or run while carrying them,” said Sudhir Shenoy, a senior corporate executive.“While we were returning, a walker asked me to rush towards the car and when I reached the spot after a walk to Nahur, I saw many car windows were broken and wallets, clothes and mobile phones had been stolen,” said Govind.She said she lost her Aadhar, PAN and identity cards apart from a sizable amount of cash. “Luckily, I wasn’t carrying my mobile phone that day,” she said.But several others weren’t that lucky. Rajesh Aerat, a Bhandup resident, initially thought he had lost his mobile phone, ₹6500 in cash, four credit cards and two debit cards.“While I was sitting at the police station and trying to block all my cards that were stolen, I learnt that the thieves had changed the PIN code of my debit cards using my cell phone and withdrew ₹9.5 lakh from my bank account,” said Aerat.The money in his bank account was from a fixed deposit he claimed to have closed recently to pay for his son’s education. Vikhroli police said the accused carried out 68 withdrawals in an hour’s time after the theft to siphon off ₹ 9.5 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-morning-walkers-cars-broken-into-cash-phone-debit-cards-stolen-101629782310750.html

24-08-2021||Bangalore||Allow WFH till Dec 2022 to help Bengaluru Metro work: K’taka govt to IT firms||The Karnataka government has requested large corporations with offices on the Outer Ring Road (ORR) or Bengaluru’s IT corridors to extend work from home (WFH) to their employees till the end of December 2022. The department of information technology, biotechnology, science & technology has made this request for the soon-to-be initiated Metro rail construction on the stretch from Silk Board to KR Puram and from there to the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA). “We would like to bring to your notice, that BMRCL (Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited) is starting metro construction works on outer Ring Road (ORR) from Central Silk Board to KR Puram and the construction of the same could extend to about 1.5 to 2 years. The ORR houses many large Tech Parks and IT company campuses and carries large amount of traffic throughout the day. The ORR, despite having 6 lanes and service roads, is infamous for its perennial traffic congestion,” EV Ramanna Reddy, the additional chief secretary, IT/BT, S&T department said in his letter to the regional director of NASSCOM. Bengaluru’s IT companies were among the first to extend WFH which allowed the multi-billion dollar industry to continue operations despite the Covid- 19 pandemic-induced lockdown. The department said that it would be beneficial if “the IT companies especially located in ORR, would extend the work from home option for most of the employees till December 2022, and/or the IT parks/companies may be advised to stagger the working hours for those employees working physically at office.” The department added that the companies which wish to resume operations encourage their workers to use company or public buses to reduce congestion. “We request you to circulate this advisory to IT companies located on ORR so that infrastructure development activities are carried out smoothly, which would also ease out traffic congestion in future,” Reddy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/allow-wfh-till-dec-2022-to-help-bengaluru-metro-work-k-taka-govt-to-it-firms-101629777570297.html
24-08-2021||Patna||Bihar to push for reopening of JP Setu over Ganga to heavy vehicles||The Bihar government will soon request railways to allow reopening of JP Setu, the rail-cum-road bridge on the river Ganga to heavy vehicles citing traffic congestion in the capital city. A few months after the inauguration of the 11-km long elevated corridor from AIIMS, Patna to Digha, the railway ministry ordered suspension of trucks’ movement on the bridge, citing the possibility of its structure getting damaged by heavy load. Additional chief secretary (ACS), road, Amrit Lal Meena said that the road construction department (RCD) will again formally request the railway ministry to allow movement of heavy vehicles once the formalities for naming the AIIMS-Digha elevated corridor as Patli Path is over. “Chief minister Nitish Kumar has consented to naming the elevated corridor Patli Path, which signifies the rich historical legacy of the town. There was a village called Patli, situated on the confluence of Ganga and Sone. The then emperor of Magadh, Ajatsatru built a clay castle near the village and the emperor’s son later built the city named Patliputra, which later came to be known as Patna,” said Meena. Citing the ban of heavy vehicles on JP Setu as the major reason for sparse traffic on the corridor, a senior officer of the RCD said they will again request the ministry of railways to reopen the Ganga bridge to heavy vehicles. “Almost all major roads of the capital city are witnessing traffic congestions as only the under-construction Gandhi Setu in Patna is available for heavy vehicles to cross the river,” said the officer. Meena said the state could propose that one-way traffic of trucks, from north to south, is allowed on the JP bridge as the trucks generally return empty or without heavy loads. “Generally, trucks, which go from south to north Bihar are loaded with construction materials like sand, quarry, etc, and hence they weigh heavier. Study shows that trucks from north to south Bihar generally return empty or with foodgrains, which are lighter in weight,” said the ACS. The elevated corridor was inaugurated by Nitish Kumar on November 30, 2019 during his first official programme as the chief minister of the newly-elected government. The same month, the ministry of railways banned traffic of heavy vehicles on the bridge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-to-push-for-reopening-of-jp-setu-over-ganga-to-heavy-vehicles-101629776250125.html

Earlier, the police had initiated inquest proceedings under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The man had married the accused in March.In his complaint, the victim’s father had said that his son had gone to his in-laws’ house in Netaji Nagar of Haibowal on August 19 and ended his life the very next day by consuming poison. “Initially, I was baffled as to why he had chosen to end his life and therefore did not lodge a complaint. However, on August 22, one of his friends told me that my son had called him saying that his in-laws were trying to sell the jewellery that had been gifted during the wedding. When my son objected, they humiliated and threatened him.” The victim had also said that he was considering ending his life. The victim’s friend had recorded the conversation.

However, for station house officers and police post in-charges in Ludhiana, this is no hyperbole as the sleepless nights are officially mandated, with meetings being convened at ungodly hours and at a short notice for the last two days. After taking reins as police commissioner Naunihal Singh has been shaking things up and rousing police personnel from their purported stupor. Officers say meetings are being convened as early as 3am to improve cops’ reporting time.The new police commissioner has checked all offices and branches under his charge and asked police personnel to maintain cleanliness and meticulous records. An officer, who requested anonymity, said, “Most of us have started sleeping with our phones under the pillow as we are expected to report to the police control room or a police station within 30 to 40 minutes of receiving the call. That’s not all! We are also expected to be dressed sharply in crisp uniforms and gleaming shoes.” “The commissioner checked our weapons, vehicles, and uniforms and asked us to maintain things properly,” the SHO said. On Monday, cops received a message from the police control room around 3am asking them to report at the Guru Nanak Stadium within 30 minutes. “We all managed to reach the stadium at around 4am. A flag march was carried out through the Sarabha Nagar Main market to the Guru Nanak Stadium after being briefed by the commissioner,” said an SHO, requesting anonymity. A similar exercise was carried out a day on Saturday night, a day after the commissioner assumed charge. Naunihal Singh summoned all the SHOs of 28 police stations, 31 police post in-charges, unit in-charges and gazetted officers to the Bharat Nagar roundabout in the wee hours.While the flag march was carried out at 5 am on Monday, the meeting had been called at 4am on Sunday. The 300 odd cops who gathered at the designated spot, were instructed to brush up their skills such as preparedness, alertness, public dealing, responsibility and the like.To check their emergency responses, cops were split into two teams and directed to march towards the Sarabha Nagar market through separate routes.While one route marched from the Arti Chowk side, the second team took the Pakhowal- Hero Bakery route to reach the Sarabha Nagar market.“The cops’ emergency response time and preparedness were checked. Such practices will be carried out on a routine basis to sharpen the skills of the police officers holding key posts,” said Naunihal.Meanwhile, a disgruntled officer, said, “We are already overworked and have to work till late in the night. Now, we have also taken to sleeping with one eye open!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cp-calling-ludhiana-cops-on-their-toes-for-3-am-meetings-101629752728532.html

24-08-2021||Chandigarh||Day after launch, project to clean Buddha Nullah hits roadblock||With the Punjab Water Regulation and Development Authority asserting that the move to release 200 cusecs of freshwater into the Buddha Nullah each day may lead to an ecological disaster and disturb the fragile biodiversity of the Sutlej River, the Ludhiana municipal corporation on Monday found itself embroiled in yet another controversy merely a day after it launched the ₹9.8-crore project.Nixing the corporation’s hypothesis that releasing water in the Buddha Nullah will increase oxygenation, PWRDA member SS Kukal said, “How can mixing polluted effluents in fresh water increase oxygenation? Oxygenation will not take place until effluent discharge is treated.” Kukal, who was formerly the dean of Punjab Agricultural University’s college of agriculture and has guided research work in soil physics, irrigation and water management, and environmental science, said, “Heavy metals discharged from the industry in the form of untreated effluents cover a distance of approximately 15km before finally mixing with the Sutlej’s waters. The process takes some time. However, releasing fresh water into the rivulet has sped up the pollution of the Sutlej River. The increased water pressure will poison the river on a larger scale and adversely affect the ecosystem within and around the waterbody.” The PWRDA will raise the issue with the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPBC) and the Ludhiana civic body. “We will seek an explanation as to why they decided to release fresh water into the polluted rivulet and also ask them to stop the project until such time that the common effluent treatment plant (CETP), sewage treatment plants (STPs) and other projects that pertain to water treatment are completed,” said Kukal.Urging stakeholders to not take a hit-and-trial approach, the former professor, said, “Cleaning the polluted rivulet is not as easy as cleaning pigeon droppings, which can be removed by pouring a bucketful of water. A permanent solution needs to be found.” A sound move, contends activist However, social activist Rahul Verma, who was involved in building an escape regulator channel from the Sirhind feeder canal near Neelon village, rebutted Kukal’s theory. “Firstly, only 50 cusecs of water is being released in the initial stages of the project. Secondly, the chemical oxygen demand, and biochemical oxygen demand (COD and BOD) levels showed improvement a day after the water was released into the nullah. Thirdly, rain water is already entering the rivulet from different sources. If Kukal’s theory is to be believed then the rain water should also be stopped from entering the nullah!” Verma said. Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu also reiterated that only 50 cusecs of water was being released from the channel. The mayor said work had already started on two new sewage treatment plants (STPs) with a combined capacity of 285 MLD – Jamalpur 225 MLD and Balloke 60 MLD; the rehabilitation of existing STPs with a treatment capacity of 418 MLD; two effluent treatment plants (ETPs) for the treatment of 6 MLD wastewater from two dairy complexes in Tajpur and Haibowal; six intermediate pumping stations; and the laying of a 10-km pipeline under the ₹650-crore Buddha Nullah rejuvenation project. “The project will be completed by December 2022,” he maintained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/day-after-launch-project-to-clean-buddha-nullah-hits-roadblock-101629752128452.html

The two advisers, Malvinder Singh Mali and Pyare Lal Garg, however, remained defiant, saying their remarks were “final”.Slamming the duo, Tewari tweeted: “I urge Harish Rawat, AICC general secretary and in-charge of Punjab affairs, to seriously introspect that those who don’t consider J&K to be a part of India and also have pro-Pakistan leanings should be a part of Punjab Congress. He said such people mock all those who have shed blood for India. Tewari’s tweet came a day after chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh described the remarks by Sidhu’s advisers as “atrocious, ill-conceived and potentially dangerous to the peace and stability of the state and the country.” Sidhu on August 11 had appointed Mali, a former government teacher and political analyst, and Garg, a former registrar of Baba Farid University of Health and Sciences, as his advisers to seek their “wise counsel.” In a recent social media post, Mali had reportedly said if Kashmir was a part of India, then what was the need to have Articles 370 and 35A. He had also said, “Kashmir is a country of Kashmiri people.” Garg had reportedly questioned the chief minister’s criticism of Pakistan.Rawat hinted at taking a “strict action” against Mali, saying: “I would like to clarify on behalf of the party that J&K is an integral part of India. Nobody has the right to cast doubt on its status, let alone issuing a statement.” Also, he warned of action over a sketch of Indira Gandhi posted by Mali on Facebook wherein she is seen standing near a heap of human skulls with a gun in her hand. “She was one of the most popular leaders, a mother figure to us. If somebody insults her, we condemn it. Action will be taken if this is proven”, he added. Amid mounting pressure, Sidhu held a marathon meeting with Mali and Garg at his Patiala residence. “Some political leaders and parties have started issuing ‘fatwa’ against me instead of initiating a dialogue. Dialogue is the best option to resolve issues,” Mali said after the meeting. Garg defended his statements critical of the CM, saying he was not a party worker, and only an adviser to Sidhu, and thus has the liberty to speak in his personal capacity on every issue. “When a government does good work, we appreciate it. But if it performs badly, we criticise it,” he added. Sidhu wasn’t available for his comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-mp-tewari-slams-sidhu-s-two-advisers-as-controversy-over-kashmir-pak-remarks-snowballs-duo-remains-defiant-101629749127534.html

In a meeting, the SGPC executive committee decided to print the saroops in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and some European countries. “The sangat (devotees) in various countries was demanding holy saroops for the gurdwaras. Keeping this in mind, the decision of setting up printing presses was taken after a thorough discussion,” said SGPC president Jagir Kaur after the meeting.As per an edict issued by the Akal Takht in 1998, the rights of printing the saroops were reserved with the SGPC and any other institution seeking to do so had to take permission of the apex gurdwara body which decided to retain the rights with it only. Recently, printing holy ‘saroops’ in Surrey in Canada in defiance of Akal Takht’s edict had angered the Sikhs who apprehended alterations in the copies. “The decision was taken due to the problems faced while sending the holy saroops abroad. Now, the printing will be carried out under the supervision of the SGPC in different countries,” Kaur added. They will also make arrangements to send the saroops to various states in India by road, she added. The gurdwara body will also install a portrait of slain American Sikh police officer Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal who was shot dead on duty during a traffic stop, in the Central Sikh Museum in the shrine complex, Kaur said. Dhaliwal, 42, was the first Sikh sheriff deputy in Harris county that has a population of over 10,000 Sikhs. He had made national headlines when he was allowed to grow a beard and wear a turban on the job. Portraits of Nankana Sahib massacre martyrs Ishar Singh and jathedar Amar Singh will also installed in the museum, it was decided.

He was presiding over the 16th convocation of Chaudhary Sarwan Kumar Himachal Pradesh Agriculture University (HPAU), Palampur, where chief minister Jai Ram Thakur was the chief guest. The governor appealed to the young scientists to become job givers instead of job seekers, for which they should move towards self-employment. “Your knowledge should benefit the society and the agricultural community in particular,” said the governor, adding that the youths were the assets of the country. A nation develops only when its youth is focused and disciplined, said Arlekar. He said that last year, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research had ranked HPAU 14th among all agricultural universities and farm institutions of the country. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said the state government was working to protect the interests of farmers and development of the state was not possible without focusing on the agriculture sector. He said that despite protests, the Centre took decisions to formulate new laws for welfare of farmers and enacted the Kisan Samman Nidhi for small and marginal farmers of the country. He laid stress on promoting natural farming in the state and called on the farmers to give up chemical farming. He further stated the state government was promoting natural farming in Himachal and a provision of ₹25 crore was made to popularise it among the farmers. The CM said that research on agricultural production techniques, different crop varieties, land and water management, use and conservation of biological resources and pest control techniques were vital not only to ensure optimum use of natural resources and increase crop yield, but also strengthen the economy of the farmers. Former HP CM Shanta Kumar said this university has created a special niche for itself among the agriculture universities of the country.

Remotely operated underwater vehicles, hand-held navigation system with sonar, side scanner sonar with echo sensor and portable transducer, divers propulsion vehicle, multi-beam sonar and submarine rescue unit of navy have been pressed into service,” said defence spokesman Lt Col Devender Anand.In addition, Special Forces commandos along with Marcos of the Indian Navy are carrying out continuous diving in the areas being identified through the technical means. “To facilitate the same, the Indian Army has also created a large floating platform from where all diving operations along with the launch of special equipment are being executed. Various agencies like NDRF, civilian experts and dam authorities have also been incorporated in the search operations,” said Col Anand.“Indian Navy has been constantly upgrading the equipment being used for this search and salvage operation. The challenge of operating remotely controlled equipment at a depth where human intervention is not feasible and visibility is not more than a few inches is being handled by incorporating electronic multi-beam sonars, he added.“The search operations are being spearheaded by a commodore-rank officer who is expert in naval rescue operations along with an Indian Army brigadier having expertise in civil engineering aspects. In addition, search operations are being monitored round the clock by GOC Gurj Division and GOC Rising Star Corps making regular visits to the crash site,” said Col Anand.The search and rescue operations continue to be executed at a war footing.On August 15, after 12 days of the crash, body of one of the two pilots of the ill-fated Rudra helicopter was recovered from the lake.On August 11, on the ninth day of intense searches since the helicopter crashed into Ranjit Sagar Dam in Basohli area of Kathua district, the rescuers had located the wreckage of machine at a depth of nearly 80 metres in the vast lake. The Rudra helicopter had crashed into the Ranjit Sagar Dam lake near Pathankot on August 3 around 10.43am.

24-08-2021||Chandigarh||HP apple cultivators seek support price on lines of Kashmir||Days after a steep fall in apple prices in Himachal Pradesh, growers across the state have asked the government to provide support prices for the crop on the lines of Jammu and Kashmir. Expressing serious concern over fall in apple prices and ‘exploitation’ of farmers by commission agents in utter disregard of the APMC Act, the Kisan Sangharsh Samiti has asked the state government to fully implement the Market Intervention Scheme. “Open bidding should be done in the markets by strictly implementing the provisions of the law,” said Sanjay Chauhan, general secretary of the samiti, adding that only those who have licences and permits should be allowed to trade. The farmers for long have been demanding the government that it ensures that the commission agents pay the farmers for their produce on the same day of fruit sale .Usually, it’s a trend in the market that the commission agents delay the payments and in some cases, farmers receive their payments months after the sale of fruit. Chauhan said the provision seeking payment to the farmers for their produce on the day of procurement will be strictly implemented and stern action will be taken against those who flout the norms. The continuous nosedive in the apple markets in the last 10 days has once again raised serious concern for the ₹6,000-crore apple economy. If the government fails to meet our demands, the Kisan Sangharsh Samiti will launch a stir by mobilising the farmers, Chauhan said. Farmers also hold the government policies responsible for the low profits in apple cultivation. “The anti-famers policies of the state government have resulted in increase in the input cost of agriculture and horticulture,” Chauhan said, adding that subsidy on fertilisers, seeds, insecticides, fungicides and other cost items has been stopped and the farmers are forced to buy these items at exorbitant prices. The prices for a 20kg apple box in the market varies from ₹300 to ₹1,400, which is the lowest in the last 15 years while the production cost has increase manifold, Chauhan said. So far, the government is procuring only C Grade apples, that too at ₹9.5 per kg, which is much lower than in Kashmir. Farmers are also worried about the government efforts to make the APMC Act more effective . Farmers alleged that the commission agents and wholesaler cartel in the state was so strong that it controlled the day-to-day rates. The Kisan Samiti alleged the farmers were being charged ₹40 - ₹60 per box illegally in the name of labour charge, bank/DD charge and discount. He said the labour charge is fixed ₹8 per box while the farmers were being charged ₹15. Apart from it, 2% is being deducted in the name of bank charge, Chahan said, while demanding the government to immediately intervene to stop this “loot”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hp-apple-cultivators-seek-support-price-on-lines-of-kashmir-101629747987485.html
24-08-2021||Mumbai||HC warns Maharashtra health secretary over malnutrition deaths of tribal children||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the Maharashtra to send specialist doctors to Melghat and other tribal areas, and has put the state health secretary on notice and asked him to be on guard if any more malnutrition deaths were reported in the state’s tribal belts.The warning was issued after HC was informed by petitioners that despite various orders of the court and the constitution of a core committee to oversee the provision of medical facilities in Melghat and other tribal areas to arrest malnutrition deaths of tribal children, the state had done very little to implement HC’s orders, even as malnutrition deaths kept on occurring till date. The petitioners also sought an audit of the funds received from the Centre towards the upliftment of tribal areas and alleviation of the problems faced by them. HC has asked the state and Centre to file affidavits and also asked the petitioners to give the latest update on malnutrition deaths in the tribal areas before the next hearing. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) and civil applications related to them filed by Dr Rajendra Burma, was informed by senior advocate Jugal Kishore Gilda that since 1993 when the first PIL had been filed highlighting the issue of malnutrition, HC had passed several orders and directions to address the issue. Gilda submitted that while some initiatives were taken by the state government and the situation has improved, due to lack of proper medical facilities in Melghat, there was an estimation that 900 children could die due to malnutrition. He added that children and expecting mothers not only from Melghat, but 11 other sensitive tribal areas such as Nandurbar and Palghar, were suffering due to insufficient medical aid. Bandu Sane, an activist who has been working in tribal belts In Melghat region, submitted that between May 2020 to June this year, 70 children have died and there have been 257 child deaths in the past two years and over 11,000 children were underweight. He added that the situation was grave as only doctors with Bachelor of Ayurveda, Medicine, and Surgery (BAMS) qualifications were assigned to the region by the government and there were no paediatricians or gynaecologists. Sane also sought an audit of the funds received from Centre towards upliftment of tribal areas and alleviation of problems faced by the residents. Advocate Neha Bhide for the state submitted that the government did not consider the PILs as adversarial, and even one death due to malnutrition was of concern. Hence, measures were being taken to address the issue. She added that while the Central government was responsible for disbursing funds to the state under various schemes, the state was cognizant of its responsibility to implement the schemes effectively. After hearing the submissions, the court observed that it seemed there were no paediatrician, gynaecologist or radiologist in the area and such specialists should be posted there immediately. “If your machinery is so well-equipped, why 73 deaths of malnutrition took place and children are dying till date? From tomorrow we want the situation to be monitored by doctors (sic),” said the bench. The court further said that if there was a dearth of doctors, the state could organise regular visits of doctors from civic and civil-run hospitals to these regions and directed advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni to appear before it after two weeks. While directing the state to ensure that doctors monitor the tribal areas regularly, the court warned the secretary of health of being held responsible for any more deaths due to malnutrition. The court then directed the Centre to file an affidavit enumerating the funds disbursed by it under various schemes for tribal welfare and how it is monitoring the implementation of the schemes and also asked the petitioners to file an affidavit on the number of deaths and posted the PILs for hearing on September 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-warns-maharashtra-health-secretary-over-malnutrition-deaths-of-tribal-children-101629747867375.html

Taking inspiration from him, 80 members of his family and relatives had also pledged to donate their organs.“Lopes had expressed his desire to donate his and his family’s organs. Some of the members are abroad. They all made the organ donation pledge online in 2016. One of Lopes’ sons – Elias, 65 – died of cancer in 2018. We could get only his eyes as the organs of cancer patients cannot be donated,” said Purshottam Pawar, president of the federation, adding that persons who die of natural causes can donate their eyes, heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, intestine, pancreas, and skin.“In Lopes’ case, we could only receive his skin due to the pandemic. We could not take his eyes as he was above 80 years of age. Even bones and bone marrow can be donated only by healthy people,” said Pawar.“Our organisation is reaching out to villages in Vasai-Virar, Palghar and other areas in the state so that people come forward and pledge to donate their organs, tissues and other body parts for research in medical colleges,” said Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/88yearold-maharashtra-man-s-skin-donated-for-medical-research-101629747507348.html

Ganesh Yadav, secretary of the Mumbai Congress’ strategy committee appointed for the civic polls, has recommended that the party should handpick mayoral candidate ahead of the elections and the face should be among Deshmukh, Sood or Soman who have a connect with the city’s youth. The recommendation by Yadav – who is also senior vice-president of Mumbai Congress – is a part of his presentation to the strategy committee, that comprises of 25 senior leaders. The report was making rounds on social media after getting leaked. When contacted, Yadav refused to comment on the suggestions and said he was not aware how the report submitted to the committee was leaked.The strategy committee is headed by Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole and comprises of Mumbai Congress chief Bhai Jagtap and other senior leaders including Ashok Chavan, Prithviraj Chavan. Mumbai civic polls are due early next year and the Congress is planning to go solo for the same. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is being ruled by the Shiv Sena for over two decades. Earlier, the Sena and BJP together were in power, but the two parties contested separately in 2017. While Sena somehow managed to retain power in the civic body, BJP finished close second. This time Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has vowed to wrest power from the Sena. Though Sena and Congress are partners in the ruling government in the state, the two parties are likely to contest the next civic polls separately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/project-sonu-sood-riteish-or-milind-soman-as-mumbai-s-mayoral-face-101629747027363.html
24-08-2021||Chandigarh||Sikh bodies working on relief efforts for Afghan nationals arriving in India||New DelhiSikh humanitarian organisations in the Delhi-NCR have started working on relief efforts to help out Afghan nationals who have fled their country to arrive in India, following Afghanistan’s takeover by the Taliban.From arranging accommodations to making education provisions for the children of those who have come seeking aid, organisations like the Hemkunt Foundation, Khalsa Aid International, and the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) have stepped up to lend a helping hand.“Whatsoever effort is required to rehabilitate the Afghans coming to India, we will do that … whether it is accommodation or any other kind of financial aid,” DSGMC president Manjinder Singh Sirsa told PTI.He said the committee’s guest houses across Delhi would be available to all Afghans who were compelled to leave their own country, beginning Monday night.“People will start coming in from today, and arrangements have been made for them to stay at the Bangla Sahib gurdwara,” Sirsa said.Afghanistan has been in a state of panic ever since its former president Ashraf Ghani abdicated his chair earlier this month, leaving large parts of the country to be taken over by the Islamist militant group.What ensued was chaos across several Afghan cities, with thousands of Afghan citizens flooding the Kabul airport in the hope of leaving their homeland for a safer place.Preempting the need for rehabilitating Afghans arriving in India in wake of the current circumstances in their country, the Hemkunt Foundation has recreated their tent city model from the Singhu border, one of the biggest protest sites of the ongoing farmers agitation, in Gurgaon.The facility has a capacity to house 500 individuals and will be functional from Tuesday afternoon, said Harteerath Singh, community development director at the Hemkunt Foundation.“In our tent city, we will be giving food and accommodation to refugees and Afghans who are here legally only. The women will be inside a permanent structure, and the men will be inside waterproof insulated tents. We have coolers, water, food and all kinds of provisions for them to be comfortable,” Singh said.He said that while the foundation will take in all Afghan nationals irrespective of their religion and caste, passports and visas will be checked.“At the moment, we are hoping to reach out to those in need through word of mouth, but we will be rolling out a helpline soon so that those seeking aid can call on that number,” Singh added.Similar efforts are being undertaken by the Khalsa Aid International which will be launching a helpline soon to make help accessible to those flying in from Afghanistan.“While the finer details are yet to be worked out, we will be launching a helpline soon so that Afghans coming in India and in need of help can approach us.“Provisions, including accommodation, as well as education for their children will be made available by us,” said Khalsa Aid director Amarpreet Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sikh-bodies-working-on-relief-efforts-for-afghan-nationals-arriving-in-india-101629746907533.html

Forty-six Afghan Hindus and Sikhs along with stranded Indian nationals are blessed to return on the same flight.” Referring to those still stranded in Kabul, Chandhok said the 10km drive to the international airport from the gurdwara through various checkpoints is one of the biggest challenges in the rescue efforts.Around 100 more Afghan Sikhs and Hindus are likely to be evacuated soon, Chandhok added.“The evacuation of these 46 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus at such a challenging time is a big relief for us,” said Manjinder Singh Sirsa, president of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, which is also coordinating with the Indian government in the evacuation mission.“US security forces escorted these people to the Kabul airport,” he said.India on Monday brought back 146 citizens on four different flights from Qatar’s capital Doha, days after they were evacuated from Afghanistan by NATO and American aircraft amid the deteriorating security situation in the war-torn country.On Sunday, it had evacuated 392 individuals from Kabul on three flights. Among them were 24 Afghan Sikhs, including two Afghan MPs -- Narinder Singh Khalsa and Anarkali Kaur Honaryar -- and their families.India is carrying out the evacuation missions in coordination with the US and several other friendly countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/three-copies-of-guru-granth-sahib-46-sikhs-hindus-being-flown-in-from-kabul-101629746787303.html

24-08-2021||Delhi||R-day violence: Delhi court pulls up police for ‘convenient’ investigation||A city court on Monday admonished the city police for arresting common farmers instead of their leaders in connection to the violence during the farmers’ protest rally on Republic Day, saying that they were just following their leaders.Additional sessions judge Gagandeep Singh, during the hearing on the anticipatory bail plea of gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana, said it appeared that the police investigation into the case was going as per the “convenience of the investigating authority instead of as per the mandate of the law”.“The common farmers who were just following the calls of their leaders are being picked up and it appears that till date none of the leaders have been even asked to join the investigation,” the judge said.Thousands of farmers protesting against three contentious laws that seek to deregulate agricultural trade clashed with the police and damaged public property during a tractor rally on Republic Day.Earlier, on August 9, the court asked the police to file a status report on its investigation with regard to the 35 leaders named in the FIR related to the case.Senior advocate Ramesh Gupta, appearing for Sidhana, told the court that the FIR was registered after 12 hours of the incident, and includes the names of 35 leaders but despite the lapse of eight months, none of them have either been arrested or asked to join the investigation.Additional Public Prosecutor G S Guarya, appearing for the police, admitted that the report filed was cryptic and does not address the issues raised by the court.The court said the report filed by the police was an attempt to sidetrack the issue, and noted that the investigating officer’s “main evidence” against Sidhana was also not up to the mark.It said that there was no audio and it cannot be heard what Sidhana was saying to the other protesters.The court directed that the proper video of the alleged instigating speech given by Sidhana should be submitted.The matter will be heard on August 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rday-violence-court-pulls-up-police-for-convenient-investigation-101629746417372.html

The family of the missing lady was asked to identify the body,” police inspector Pramod Toradmal from Vashi Police Station said. The police interrogated around 250 people and examined around 350 CCTV footage and found the video clip of the victim going towards Inorbit mall with an unidentified man on the day of the incident. Using the sketch of the accused made with the help of CCTV footage, the culprit was nabbed. To hide his identity, he had cut his hair and threw away his bag which was seen in the footage. “The accused is a homeless man who usually slept under Sanpada bridge and loitered around railway stations. On July 29, the deceased lost her way home in Govandi and ended up reaching Vashi wherein the accused saw her. In the pretext of giving her food to eat, he asked her to accompany him. He took her to the isolated area under the flyover, behind Inorbit mall and tried to sexually abuse her, which she resisted. The accused then stabbed her on her neck with a broken glass bottle lying nearby and then hit her head with a stone and then dumped the body in a gunny bag lying in the garbage bin,” senior police inspector Ramesh Chavan from Vashi police station said. The accused was arrested on August 22 from the Vashi Railway station area and is in police custody till August 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/26yearold-held-for-murder-of-70-year-old-in-vashi-101629746546793.html

The plea, which runs into 1,114 pages, demands quashing of the judgment. It had also demanded a stay on the judgment, but the court did not yield, without seeking a response from the government and other parties. The bench of justice AG Masih and justice Ashok Kumar Verma has sought these responses by December 7.The April 9 judgment of a single-judge bench had come on the 2019 plea of Gurdeep Singh Pandher, a former Punjab Police sub-inspector and the then Kotkapura station house officer (SHO) being probed in these FIRs. Pandher had moved the high court, levelling allegations against Singh and had also sought his ouster from the SIT. The high court had ordered the removal of Singh as SIT member and quashed the challan presented in the FIR in its April 9 judgment. The court had also made adverse remarks against Singh. The judgment had led to Singh resigning from service and subsequently joining Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). He had also accused the state government’s legal team of putting up a “weak defence”. The plea says the single-judge bench assumed the jurisdiction of trial court and decided a matter which could only have been decided by the trial court. The process of adjudication so “adopted” by the single judge is totally contrary to the procedure of the criminal justice system as envisaged under the CrPC, the plea claims. “ ... Single judge is proceeding with a pre-conceived notion that the appellant was a puppet in the hands of the state government and was furthering political agenda of the state of Punjab. This is absolutely incorrect and amounts to an illegal observation, as the appellant was only performing his duties as a police officer of known integrity,” the petition underlines, adding that Singh’s response to Gurdeep’s plea was not examined or analysed in the judgment. The plea claims that single-judge bench arrived at the decision without even reading the challan report. “The impugned order does not examine the credentials of the petitioners, does not even appreciate as to how and why and what circumstances prompted them to rush to this hon’ble court by engaging the senior-most lawyers with extreme heavy legal fee and who paid those fees as to whether the petitioners in separate petitions were just a front for senior politicians, who do not want to face trial ....,” the plea states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2015-kotkapura-firing-hc-seeks-punjab-response-on-ex-ips-s-plea-challenging-april-judgment-101629745947150.html

The cabinet minister, along with state working president Kuljit Singh Nagra, heard them for more than three hours at the Punjab Congress Bhawan, the party’s office in Chandigarh. Ashu was the first cabinet minister to sit at the state unit headquarters. Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had last week, on Punjab Congress chief Najvot Singh Sidhu’s request, deputed the cabinet ministers to be available at the party office by rotation to listen to people’s grievances. As per the roster, local government minister Brahm Mohindra was to meet the party workers on Monday. However, Mohindra, who heads the ministerial group that has been holding talks to redress the state employees’ grievances, had a pre-scheduled meeting with officials on their demands. The minister said he wrote to the CM informing him about his engagement and requested him to assign it to some other minister. The chief minister deputed the food and civil supplies minister. After the meeting, Ashu said there were about 50 people who came with personal work or issues related to police, local government, revenue, food and rural development departments. “I heard each one of them and spoke to officials. I told them to solve their issues and report within 15 days,” he said. While Nagra listened to the Congress workers who came with issues related to the party’s organisational set-up, rural development and panchayats minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa also visited the party office. As per the programme, one minister each is to be available at the party office for three hours (11am to 2pm), and in case the minister is deputed for a particular day is unable to make it for some reason, he or she will arrange for a substitute. The duty roster has been issued by for next four months. The move is drawing flak from the opposition, particularly the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which has raised questions over its timing and the intentions of the ruling party. AAP MLA Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer said the cabinet ministers belong to and get paid by the government and not a party. “They should sit in their government offices and listen to everyone and not just the workers of one party,” he said. However, Ashu said the ministers would continue to meet people at their offices and official residences like before.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cong-kickstarts-new-programme-ashu-first-to-meet-people-at-party-office-101629745708453.html

The difference in the minimum age limit for the post of sub-inspectors as 18 years on one the hand and the minimum age for the post of constables and sub-constables as 21 years on the other hand is arbitrary and violates Article 14 of Constitution of India, candidates had argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-lowers-minimum-age-for-constable-recruitment-101629745647157.html

24-08-2021||Chandigarh||Increase cane SAP to ₹360 per quintal: Bajwa to Amarinder||Congress Rajya Sabha member Partap Singh Bajwa on Monday urged chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to increase the state assured price(SAP) of sugarcane to ₹360 per quintal for the 2021-22 season and also release the pending payments of ₹118 crore for the previous year. In a letter to the CM, Bajwa said the SAP of ₹360 per quintal would be in the best interest of the cane growers of Punjab. He said this would be a genuine increase to cover the basic costs of cultivation. “It is a matter of great concern that the SAP has not seen an increase during the last four seasons and remains at ₹310 per quintal. The increase of ₹15 declared by your government is not enough because the cost of production has increased over the last four years,” he said. The Congress MP said that neighbouring Haryana had announced ₹358 per quintal for 2021-22. Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, and Sugarfed Punjab had recommended ₹350 per quintal for the coming season keeping in mind the cost of cultivation, he added. He also said that an amount of ₹117.6 crore --- cooperative mills ₹54.96 crore and private mills ₹62.64 crore --- was due to the cane growers as on August 18. “This amount is huge for the struggling cane farmers,” he said, requesting the CM to order its release to ensure payment of all dues for the previous season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/increase-cane-sap-to-rs-360-per-quintal-bajwa-to-amarinder-101629745527166.html
24-08-2021||Chandigarh||MRTS: Chandigarh admn to go for fresh study||After years in cold storage, the mass rapid transport system (MRTS) plans have been revived with the Chandigarh administration deciding to go in for a fresh study on the comprehensive mobility plan for the city.With a population of over 12 lakh and 15 lakh registered vehicles, Chandigarh has the highest density of vehicles per household in the country, leading to traffic congestion and snarls. In addition to these, over two lakh vehicles on interstate routes cross the city daily.Since the metro rail plans were shelved, the administration has not been able to opt for any other alternative, such as monorail, skybus or metrolite.The decision to have a fresh study on the MRTS was taken after UT officials held a meeting with representatives of the Rail India Technical and Economic Services (RITES) here on Monday. The RITES made presentation on its 2009 report.“The RITES had prepared a report on the city’s mobility needs in 2009. But this has been found outdated now. The city’s needs have changed dramatically in the last more than a decade. Also, the guidelines set by the housing and urban affairs ministry for the MRTS project have changed, which necessitates a fresh look at the problem. Therefore, the administration will go in for a new study,” said a senior UT official privy to the development.The RITES had proposed that Metro would cover a distance of 52.4 km, of which 40.4 km will be in Chandigarh and the rest in Mohali. The alignments were proposed both above ground as well as underground. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation had prepared the detailed project report of the first phase of the project.Confirming the development, UT adviser Dharam Pal said: “The 2009 report was prepared on the basis of old guidelines and old data, which are outdated now. So, whole thing has to be planned and prepared as per the latest guidelines if we have to seek funding from the Union government. We have decided for a comprehensive fresh study.”Pal has directed the UT officials to start the process for the framing of a new study, preferably by the RITES as it has already conducted a study in the city.“It will take another month or so before we engage an agency for the study. We have to decide as to whether it would be through nomination or we have to float tenders. I have asked the officials to work on these issues,” said Pal.Study will decide the optionThe metro rail proposal was dropped after opposition from MP Kirron Kher, architects and conservationists. Later, in 2017, the central government had declared Metro was not viable for the city.The monorail proposal is also hanging fire. Recently, another alternative, skybus, was also found to be not viable. The latest option was metrolite. Last year, the administration had sought to be part of the central government’s pilot projects to be developed across the country.“The MRTS option will be decided on the basis of the needs and traffic load of the city. The agency will have to study the peak hour traffic and congested routes. The cost aspects will also need to be studied before the option can be decided,” said Pal.Stating that the administration was ready to go alone on the project if necessary, the UT adviser said: “At this point in time, we have not taken on board the neighbouring governments. However, the administration will seek their cooperation by seeking a meeting of chief secretaries of the neighbouring states under the aegis of the UT administrator.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mrtschandigarhadmn-to-go-for-fresh-study-101629745407226.html
24-08-2021||Mumbai||Can’t provide long-term vaccination slots: Maharashtra government to HC||In an affidavit filed in the Bombay high court (HC), the Maharashtra government has expressed its inability to provide long-term vaccination slots. The affidavit has stated that though the Centre has allocated a month-long allocation schedule for vaccine doses, manufacturers do not provide supplies accordingly. Hence, it is not possible to give long term vaccination slots.The affidavit was filed in reply to a public interest litigation (PIL), seeking streamlining of vaccination bookings and awareness of its availability at various centres, especially for the not-so-tech-savvy citizens. It further stated that the personnel at vaccination centres have been trained to help people register for the jabs. Meanwhile, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has submitted that a total of 9 million residents of Mumbai have been vaccinated so far and around 50% of bedridden persons were vaccinated through home vaccination drive. BMC further submitted that 133 of the 3,003 victims of fake vaccination scams have been revaccinated at civic facilities, while 130 more took the shots at privately centres. HC was also informed that 127 victims have refused to get vaccinated again. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni was hearing the PILs filed by citizens Yogeeta Rajesh Vanzara and Siddharth Chandrashekhar, seeking directions to ease the use of the CoWin app, especially for the elderly, and iron out the problems while booking vaccination slots and provide the jabs to the elderly on priority basis.Advocate Jamsheed Master, who represented the petitioners, informed HC that the state had failed to provide week-long booking slots, though it had assured the bench of doing so in the previous hearing. Master informed the bench that vaccination centres were only posting booking slots a day prior, and they have not had vaccines for the past three days. Responding to the claims of the petitioner, additional government pleader submitted the affidavit by Dr Dilip Narayan Patil, deputy director, state health welfare bureau, Pune. The affidavit stated that while the Centre had allocated vaccine plans in May-July on a fortnightly basis, since the start of August, it had issued a day-to-day allocation plan for the entire month to Maharashtra. However, the delivery of the vaccines was delayed from the manufacturers’ side. The affidavit further stated that as the Centre has insisted on prioritising the administration of second dose, the government was not in a position to allocate vaccines early, especially to BMC. The affidavit, however, stated that 70% of vaccines have been allocated for second dose, while the remaining 30% have been assigned for the first shot. Dr Patil has also submitted that while the CoWin portal now allows rectification of some errors, the changes in batch number and date of dose etc are not yet available, and citizens could access it as soon as the Centre made it possible. The affidavit concluded by stating that sufficient training and sensitisation of personnel manning the vaccination drive has been undertaken to help persons register at the centres itself, if they have not been able to register themselves. After hearing the submissions, HC asked additional solicitor general Anil Singh to file an affidavit stating when the rectification of certification would be available on CoWin, and also asked BMC’s counsel – senior advocate Anil Sakhare – to file an affidavit by Friday, indicating the status on vaccinated people. HC posted hearing of the PILs to August 30 for final hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cant-provide-long-term-vaccination-slots-maharashtra-government-to-hc-101629745347184.html

24-08-2021||Delhi||Hand over keys to residential section of Markaz in 2 days: Delhi HC||The Delhi high court on Monday directed the Delhi Police to hand over within two days the keys to the residential portion of the Nizamuddin Markaz to Khalida, the mother of Jamaat leader Maulana Saad, after the premises was sealed last year due to a Tablighi Jamaat congregation that reportedly resulted in a number of people who were residing there contracting Covid-19.Justice Yogesh Khanna, while hearing a plea by Khalida seeking access to the residential part of the Markaz building, said entry will not be allowed in the non-residential portion of the property. “In the meantime, let the keys to the residential premises be provided within two days...,” the judge said.Khalida challenged an order of the trial court which had set aside the order of the magistrate’s court directing the handover of keys within five days of that order.The court, while passing the recent order, observed that it cannot allow people to reside in guest houses or any other place other than their own house.Appearing for the prosecution, advocate Amit Ahlawat said the residents were, at the relevant time, living in violation of the Covid-19 protocols.In her petition filed through advocate Fuzail Ahmad Ayyubi, the petitioner, Khalida, has said that on March 31, 2020, the entire Nizamuddin mosque was locked and, to extend utmost cooperation to the authorities, the keys to the Markaz, including the residential portion, were handed over to the Delhi Police on April 1, 2020.She said the probe is “running at a snail’s pace” and any offence, if at all, was committed in the Markaz premises, was separate from the residential premises. The matter will be heard next on December 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hand-over-keys-to-residential-section-of-markaz-in-2-days-delhi-hc-101629744750756.html

24-08-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The Nagina walla||Nobody is accusing Muhammed Aaqib of being ungrateful to his adopted city. It’s just that he is too partial to Nagina, his home town in Bijnaur, UP. “It’s a fact, Nagina is far better than Dilli,” the auto rickshaw driver insists, shortly after picking up a passenger in Lakshmi Nagar. The gentleman has been working in the capital as a rickshaw driver for a decade but his heart continues to belong to his native place. “Nagina’s very air, its water, its abo-hawa (atmosphere), the way people interact with each other, their style of speaking….” Plus, Nagina has something unique, he adds with a flourish as if this were to end all the Nagina Vs Delhi arguments—and that is Tularam’s sweet rasgullas.Mr Aaqib is talking of his beloved sweet shop situated outside the town’s railway station. “Those black rasgullas are world-famous.” They tend to be so extra-soft, he claims, that they melt the moment you pop them inside the mouth. The rasgullas must be eaten when piping hot, he says.The auto stops at a traffic light. Mr Aaqib graciously grants that Delhi too has some tolerable culinary landmarks. “Bhima’ Jalebiwale near Pari Chowk makes good jalebis.” He also compliments a chhole bhathure stall in Mayur Vihar. But no place in the entire National Capital Region, he believes, rivals Tularam’s delicacy, even though its standards have lately started to slip — “they have become less soft.”In his mid-20s, Mr Aaqib lives in Mayur Vihar with a fellow Tularam loyalist—wife Nadiya. He frequently goes to his hometown, and each time visits the favoured shop at least once.But if Nagina is such a civilised town and Tularam such a great gift to mankind, why live so far away. “Because there’s no rozgar (employment) in hamare (our) Nagina,” Mr Aaqib says with the logic of a frustrated maths teacher trying to explain why two plus two is four.As he drops the customer at his destination, Mr Aaqib informs that there’s more to his Bijnaur district than Nagina’s rasgullas. “In Noorpur (town) you must try out Hukkawalon ki Manpasand Lassi… you cannot find a lassi as delicious in Dilli,” he declares matter-of-factly, totally unconscious of his home-district patriotism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-nagina-walla-101629744082758.html

The Orissa High Court in February this year had quashed the Lokayukta’s order for a probe by the state vigilance department against Gopalpur MLA Pradeep Kumar Panigrahy in an alleged case of disproportionate assets. The HC dismissed the Lokayukta order saying it was not legally tenable as the complainant and investigating agency in a quasi-judicial process cannot be the same.After the HC quashed the Lokayukta order, the anti-corruption body had moved a review petition before it which was again dismissed in April 5. The Lokayukta then moved SC through Special Leave Petition against the HC orders in February and review petition orders in April this year calling it unfair.Panigrahy, in his contempt petition filed before the Orissa High Court on August 11, alleged that the Lokayukta, while filing the special leave petition before the SC, have attached a 6-page order on April 5 which is non-existent. The MLA said while HC passed a 2-page order dismissing the review petition by Lokayukta, the bench of chief justice S Muralidhar and justice Biswanath Rath nowhere passed a 6-page judgement that was cited by the Lokayukta while moving the SC.While the contempt of court case against the Lokayukta is pending before the HC, Panigrahy on Monday filed an interlocutory application in the case before the SC seeking dismissal of the Lokayukta’s Special Leave Petition which he alleged was filed in an absolutely unethical and improper manner. In the application, Panigrahy also prayed for appropriate proceedings against Lokayukta and his officials over moving the SC citing a non-existent order.Incidentally, after Panigrahy moved Orissa HC early this month against Lokayukta, the latter filed an application before the HC registrar general seeking withdrawal of his 6-page order. The Chief Justice of Orissa High Court also ordered an in-house inquiry into the matter.Panigrahy in his application before the SC said a non-existent order formed part of the SLP before the highest court of the country.“The Lokayukta is a sacrosanct quasi-judicial body comprising of two retired judges of the High Court and one retired DGP did not bother to verify the authenticity of the order of the Registry of the High Court or from the official website of the Court where orders were being regularly uploaded during the pandemic. The genuine order (passed by the HC on April 5) was duly watermarked while the 6-page order cited by the Lokayukta was not even watermarked but still the same was placed on record before the SC without making any efforts to verify the authenticity of the same. The Lokayukta has shaken the trust of the people in the judicial system. A party, especially a quasi-judicial body, for its own and self cause should not be allowed to escape by simply withdrawing the order from the SLP,” Panigrahy wrote in his application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-mla-seeks-action-against-lokayukta-over-moving-sc-with-forged-order-101629744148849.html
24-08-2021||Delhi||Unfair to expect children orphaned by Covid to tackle bureaucracy for some relief, Delhi HC tells state govt||The Delhi high court on Monday observed that it would be unfair to expect children to procure documents for availing of welfare scheme benefits after losing their guardians to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said the city government should adopt a proactive approach rather than dealing with such applications in a routine manner as is done during normal (pre-Covid) times when one has to deal with bureaucracy.“It will be unfair to expect children who lost their parents to be able to procure certificates/documents to avail of benefits which they are entitled to on loss of parents. They will find it cumbersome to run around,” the court said, adding that “when you don’t get food, every hour, every day matters”.The observations came while hearing a plea by advocate Rakesh Malhotra seeking better facilities for people during the pandemic, including medicines such as amphotericin-B (used to treat fungal infection mucormycosis) and antiviral drug remdesveir (used to treat Covid-19).During the proceedings, advocate Prabhsahay Kaur, representing NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan, told the court that seven siblings were orphaned by the death of their parents in the months of April and May during the second wave of Covid-19.She said of the seven children, five are minors while the eldest is 23 years old and the youngest is four years old and needs to be admitted to a school. She further submitted that six of them are girls.She said though the children were duly provided for, with all basic rations and schoolbooks by the child welfare committee, they are still in dire need of care and support and it is not practically possible for them to repeatedly approach the committee for their daily needs, rations and medicines.Kaur further said the siblings were given a one-time assistance of ₹10,000 and offered a small job which one of them had to accept to meet their daily needs as no relative came forward to care of them. Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, told the court that implementation of the scheme for grant of ex gratia is taking time as verification of documents is required to be done. To this, the bench observed, “At the end of the day, they (children) want their rights. It is your policy, why should it take so long? It should come from your side without our nudging. That will be called progress.” It added that the Delhi government should evolve procedures which are simple and easily implementable while ensuring that benefits are not misused by undeserving persons. It asked the chief secretary to file a status report with the procedure involved to deal with welfare schemes under the Juvenile Justice Act.The court also issued a notice to Delhi State Legal Service Authority (DSLSA) saying it was of the view that DSLSA should play an active role in helping Delhi government to streamline the system and to help children with documents.The court was also informed that there are 6,200 children who have lost one parent and 292 children who have lost both parents to Covid; the figures are likely to change as and when new data is collected. The matter will be heard next on September 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/unfair-to-expect-children-orphaned-by-covid-to-tackle-bureaucracy-for-some-relief-delhi-hc-tells-state-govt-101629743487755.html

The demolition of Khori village began in April this year, the Corporation was unable to complete the task due to resistance from villagers, who even approached the top court for rehabilitation prior to eviction. On July 23, the civic body was given additional four weeks to complete the demolition work and provide food, medicines, and temporary shelter to the needy villagers.Exactly a month later, the corporation filed an affidavit before the top court on Monday stating that the demolition of the Khori village, that began in April this year, was complete and 150 acres of forest land freed from encroachment was now in possession of the municipal body.The affidavit filed by MCF commissioner Yash Pal said that the civic body has received a letter from deputy conservator of forests, Faridabad, providing a list of structures that were situated on forest land and were served notices under the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) 1990. “The MCF has carried out demolition of about 10 structures or violations in the shape of farmhouses on the direction of the forest department officials by providing all the necessary support.”Owners of few banquet halls that are also facing demolition appeared before the top court on Monday, seeking stay. Senior advocate Krishnan Venugopal, who appeared for banquet hall owners, said they enjoy protection of their business under earlier orders passed by the Supreme Court. They had moved representations before the Haryana government and sought stay on demolition till then.Senior advocate Arun Bhardwaj representing MCF said, “No assurance can be given that demolition will not be carried out.” The bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari backed the corporation saying, “We won’t pass such order (of staying demolition). If it is unauthorised, it has to be demolished.”Sources close to the development said that a preliminary list of 140 illegal structures has been identified for demolition. “The MCF has planned demolition drive for August 23 and 24 on the violations/illegal structures in the shape of farmhouses within the municipal limits of Faridabad on land notified under PLPA as per preliminary list communicated by Deputy Conservator of Forests, Faridabad,” the MCF affidavit stated.The list mentions illegal structures situated on revenue land in villages Ankhir, Manger, Mewla Maharajpur Pali, Lakkarpur, Badkhal and Anangpur villages in Faridabad district.Some Khori residents filed an application on July 23 in the apex court alleging discrimination by pointing out a list of 50 properties in Faridabad (mostly farmhouses, ashrams and commercial establishments) and 10 others in Gurugram district that were situated on forest land. The court instructed the corporation to examine the application and ensure that no illegal structure on forest land was spared.The MCF informed that near Surajkund tourist resort, some illegal occupants of six-acre land abutting the 150-acre Khori village has not been removed as the MCF sold this parcel of land to the Department of Tourism, Haryana in 1998, and the residents in this colony approached the Punjab and Haryana High Court for consideration of their claims.Regarding rehabilitation of the Khori villagers, the MCF said the “Housing Plan for Rehabilitation of Khori Jhuggi Dwellers” has been drafted after receiving suggestions from evacuees who represented suggestions through a dedicated email id and also through a nodal officer of MCF stationed near the demolished Khori village.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appearing for the Haryana government sought three weeks to finalise the rehabilitation policy, but the court granted two weeks. The MCF too sought four weeks to clear the rubble from the forest land. The corporation intends to restore the site by planting trees at the demolished site.The court has posted the matter for hearing on September 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aravalli-land-cleared-of-encroachments-in-khori-village-faridabad-civic-body-tells-supreme-court-101629743307025.html

Umar, along with several others, has been accused of being the “mastermind” of the February 2020 violence, which had left 53 people dead and over 700 injured.Umar’s counsel Trideep Pais told additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat that his client was being “framed” and all the allegations against him were “fabricated” and “hollow”. He said that witnesses have been taken selectively and that there were various contradictions in the police’s claims indicating that it was a “cooked up” case.Pais said a 21-minute video clip of Khalid’s speech in Maharashtra, which the prosecution allegedly labelled inflammatory, called for message of unity based on Mahatma Gandhi’s teachings. The lawyer said that the clips provided to the police by two TV channels were copied from a tweet by a BJP leader, instead of the original footage of the speech.The lawyer said that Umar did not give any call for violence in his speech. “A message of unity based on Gandhi ji was given by Umar Khalid that day. It was termed as terror. Content is not seditious. He is talking about democratic power. He referred to Gandhi,” Pais said.Pais claimed that one of the channels deliberately suppressed one sentence from the speech in which Khalid was talking about uniting the country. “It makes it quite clear that he has been framed by the press. Why did you leave this line, unless you deliberately want to paint him as a person who is inciting people to sedition,” he alleged.“These are the kind of lies they are peddling. This is a joke. This FIR is a cooked-up theory. Is it that easy to prosecute people? Do you have no responsibility as a prosecution?” Pais said.He also pointed out another contradiction in the charge sheet, saying according to the police Umar conspired with other accused on January 8 to trigger riots during former US President Donald Trump’’s visit, however, the news about the visit was announced only in February.Pais said that the FIR was so framed that statements can be given to indict people.“The charge sheet is a complete fabrication…selectively witnesses were brought to say this and that against my client…This FIR is a hollow FIR…laughable statements have been made. What will the prosecution achieve from this? The purpose of this FIR is not to bring home guilt, it’s hypocrisy. None of the people in this FIR should be held in custody,” he argued.The police are yet to argue the bail. The case will be heard next on September 3.In April, the Umar was granted bail in one of the riots cases. The court while granting him bail noted that he was not physically present at the scene of the crime on the date of the incident.Besides him, JNU students Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, Jamia Coordination Committee members Safoora Zargar, former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain and several others have also been booked under the stringent law in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/case-against-umar-khalid-based-on-edited-youtube-clip-says-his-lawyer-101629742987987.html
24-08-2021||Delhi||Blockade call not sedition, says Sharjeel Imam’s lawyer||Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Sharjeel Imam, arrested for allegedly making inflammatory speeches during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, told a Delhi court on Monday that he cannot be booked for sedition because none of his statements directly or indirectly called for violence.Imam, while seeking bail in a case related to speeches he made at two universities in 2019 where he allegedly threatened to “cut off” Assam and the rest of the Northeast from India, through his counsel Tanveer Ahmed Mir contended that the right to protest, the right to blockade, and the right to bring the country to a standstill is not equal to an act of sedition.“The speech did not call for violence. He just called for a road blockade. He did not say that the northeast should become a different state and declare independence. That would have been seditious,” Mir told additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat.He added, “What society will be a society if it’s not robust or what doesn’t react. It will be a heap of sheep.”“When Sharjeel Imam says that this piece of legislation is unconstitutional, and seeks to persuade the government to rethink and says if you don’t do it, we will be on the streets, he cannot be hammered by sedition,” Mir contended.The speeches in question were made at Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi on December 13, 2019, and at the Aligarh Muslim University on December 16, 2019. He has been in judicial custody since January 28, 2020.Imam is accused of offences relating to sedition, promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, imputations prejudicial to national integration, and public mischief under the Indian Penal Code, and indulging in unlawful activities under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, or UAPA.Delhi Police filed a charge sheet against Imam in the case, in which it alleged that he allegedly gave speeches inciting hatred, contempt, and disaffection towards the central government and instigated the people, which led to the violence outside Jamia Millia Islamia in December 2019.Mir argued that he was ‘astounded’ to see the investigating officer calling his client bigoted just because he seems to criticise the Constitution of India.“We are proud of our unity and not majoritarianism. Critical elements in our society are also necessary because in a society where criticism will die, the society will die. That is why, ultimately, the flag to uphold the Constitution in a democracy securely lies in Your Honour’s hands,” he said.“Fundamentally the right to protest, bring the country to a standstill is not at any point in time equal to an act of sedition. We went together through the contents of the speech. The petitioner at no point of time has said that you should resort to violence,” he asserted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/blockade-call-not-sedition-says-sharjeel-imam-s-lawyer-101629742886252.html
24-08-2021||Delhi||17 fresh Covid cases in Delhi, the lowest since April 15 last year||The city reported only 17 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, the fewest cases in a day April 15 last year, when 17 cases were recorded. The last time new cases were below this number was on March 28 last year when the city saw just nine new infections.To be sure, fewer tests are conducted on Sunday (which also coincided with Rakshabandhan) -- 46,251 according to the Delhi government’s health bulletin as against an average of 60,326 tests each day over the previous seven days.The first case of the viral infection in the city was reported on March 2 last year, and there have been four waves in the Capital since then. At the peak of the fourth wave of infections between April and May this year, Delhi added an average of 25,924 fresh infections everyday.Monday’s health bulletin also recorded no fresh deaths of the infection for the fourth straight day.The Capital has added four deaths of the infection over the past seven days.Experts believe that the worst is now over for Delhi.“The numbers have drastically reduced -- not because of anything anybody did. Most of the population has now been exposed to the infection. Some states like Kerala that struggled to block the spread of the infection are now experiencing a longer epidemic. But the benefit is that they lost fewer lives,” said Jayaprakash Muliyil, chairman of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the National Institute of Epidemiology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/17-fresh-covid-cases-in-delhi-the-lowest-since-april-15-last-year-101629742826250.html
24-08-2021||Delhi||SC seeks response of Centre on plea seeking to stop Dwarka highway work||The Supreme Court on Monday sought the response of the Centre on a petition filed by residents of Dwarka, seeking a halt on the construction of a new national highway close to residential buildings without obtaining a green clearance or permission for removal of trees.The residents of two group housing societies — New Millennium and Sadbhavna Apartments— along with six individuals residing in sectors 22 and 23 of Dwarka approached the top court to stall the ongoing construction of the highway project by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). Earlier, the petitioners had approached the Delhi high court, which on July 30 allowed NHAI to carry on with the construction work.With the matter still pending before the Delhi high court, the bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah of the Supreme Court agreed to examine whether the project fell short of green clearances and required to be stopped on this count.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the Dwarka residents, and the two group housing societies (comprising 280 families) informed the court that NHAI had told the Delhi high court that the road which they sought to rename as a National Highway was an existing road and not a “new highway”.Bhushan said that was not true and submitted a notification of the Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways (MoRTH) which notified the current road (DDA Road no 226) as a new national highway (NH-248BB or Dwarka Expressway).He submitted that once it was accepted that the said project was a new national highway, the environment impact assessment (EIA) notification of September 4, 2006, became applicable, thereby requiring a green nod from the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change.So far, this clearance was not obtained by NHAI, Bhushan argued.The bench noted, “The feasibility report also clearly indicates that the project in question is a greenfield project,” as it agreed to issue notice to the Centre, NHAI, the Delhi government and the Delhi Pollution Control Board. Posting the matter to August 27, the bench further said, “The application for interim relief (to stay the project) will be considered after notice is served on the respondents.”The petition filed through advocate Anand Varma stated that the project will result in air and noise pollution, besides leading to increased traffic in the area. The petitioners said residents will be deprived of vital green cover as the project required the felling of a large number of trees.They pointed to a Delhi high court order of December 18, 2020, which said no removal of trees can take place without the approval of the competent authority under the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994. The permission under this Act has lapsed and despite that fact, the high court declined to grant interim relief against NHAI, the petitioners said.Declaration of a residential road as a National Highway takes place under Section 2(2) of the National Highways Act, 1956. The petition pointed out an instance in the past, wherein an existing highway in the Capital was made a National Highway (NH-344M) in April 2018 and where NHAI had to obtain environment clearance. Despite submitting this example, the high court exempted NHAI from obtaining a green nod for Dwarka Expressway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sc-seeks-response-of-centre-on-plea-seeking-to-stop-dwarka-highway-work-101629742706785.html
24-08-2021||Delhi||Portion of Bhalswa landfill collapses, none hurt||A portion of the Bhalswa landfill in northwest Delhi collapsed early Monday morning, damaging nearly eight hutments, police officers said. No casualties or injuries were reported, but some huts and property including private vehicles were inundated with landfill waste, locals said.Residents of the hutments said a portion of the landfill collapsed on the huts around 7am, when most people were out for work or household chores. Some children inside the huts were pulled out on time, said residents.“Local people helped each other but teams from the municipality and government reached here only by afternoon. Till this time, residents could not even eat anything because their houses were covered in landfill waste,” said Shankar, a resident of the area.Residents of the area also alleged that this is not the first time that such an incident has happened in the area. In August last year, a portion of the landscape collapsed, damaging three hutments on the northwest side of the landfill.The Bhalswa landfill site is an open dumping ground near GT-Karnal road. Created in 1984, it is spread over 70 acres. Till October 2019, the landfill hit a height of 65 metres, just eight metres less than the Qutub Minar.It reached its saturation point in 2006 but the landfill still receives about 2,100 metric tonnes of mixed waste every day. More than eight million metric tonnes of legacy waste (old solid waste material) are dumped here.They also alleged that mindless waste dumping and construction has also resulted in the shrinking of access to these residential areas, because of which emergency services such as fire tenders and ambulances are also unable to reach here for the rescue.A senior North Delhi Municipal Corporation official said earth-moving machines were deployed in the area since afternoon and municipal teams were helping clear out the collapsed section of the landfill from the affected shanties.“The issue is that during monsoon season, especially after heavy rains, waste from the landfill tends to slip off,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/portion-of-bhalswa-landfill-collapses-none-hurt-101629742646246.html
24-08-2021||Delhi||AAP protests against BJP over alleged corruption in Novelty Cinema sale||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday staged demonstrations in all 272 wards in Delhi to protest against the lease sale of the plot of Novelty Cinema in north Delhi by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations (MCD) allegedly at a price much below it’s current value.“AAP workers organised ‘padyatra’ against BJP in all 272 wards of Delhi today. The protests were against the sale of ₹200-crore Novelty Cinema plot by BJP for just ₹34 crore. The BJP leaders have sold the Novelty Cinema land to their own people at throwaway prices so that they can fill their own pockets. The BJP has been committing scam after scam in the MCD and made the MCD completely bankrupt,” said Vikas Total, AAP councillor and leader of Opposition in the North MCD.While the AAP is in charge of Delhi government, the BJP rules the three municipal corporations. Delhi goes to municipal polls next year.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that North MCD will cancel the sale if AAP can bring an offer for the enhanced price. “AAP can easily make the government buy it at ₹100 crore, which is half the market price quoted by AAP leaders,” he said.Delhi BJP spokesperson further said that the circle rate of the plot is ₹18.98 crore, adding that it was sold at ₹34.70 crore, which is twice the amount.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aapprotests-against-bjp-over-alleged-corruption-in-novelty-cinema-sale-101629742406837.html
24-08-2021||Delhi||Oxygen deaths panel: Delhi govt asks LG to exercise powers ‘judiciously’||The Delhi government on Monday told the Delhi high court that the Lieutenant Governor (LG) should exercise his powers with “judiciousness” and not in an “obstructionist manner” in support of a petition that sought to operationalise the six-member high powered committee to probe into deaths caused by alleged oxygen shortage during the last wave of Covid-19 pandemic in April.In an affidavit filed before a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh, the Delhi government said LG Anil Baijal’s decision to reject the constitution of the panel twice was “misconceived” and does not withstand the test laid by the Supreme Court while deciding the powers of the city government and the LG.“….while clarifying the role of the LG and the elected government in the unique constitutional position of the NCT, the Supreme Court was at pains to emphasise that the LG is bound by the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers with regard to all transferred subjects. It was further noted that though the LG has the power to refer a matter to the President under the proviso to Article 239AA (4), such power cannot be exercised in any and every matter but must be exercised in the interest of the people / residents of Delhi”.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, said the AAP dispensation took the decision “for the people but is not being able to implement this”.“The government of the day has taken a decision that a maximum of ₹5 lakh of compensation, depending upon the committee report, wherever there is negligence, shall be granted. What is now taking place in Delhi is… because of this conflict which needs to be decided at the earliest … the citizen is being shortchanged. That can’t be permitted. At least from the point of view of the citizen, there should be an end to it, “ Mehra said.The government’s affidavit came on a plea by Riti Singh Verma who demanded that all Covid-19 deaths be probed by the expert committee, after her 34-year-old husband died of Covid-19 at a private hospital in Delhi on May 14. In her petition, Verma said the death summary of her husband issued by the hospital is “doubtful” as her husband was admitted in a “not very severe condition” and had no comorbidities. As per the summary prepared by the hospital, he died of a cardiac arrest.On May 4, the Delhi government told the Delhi high court that an expert committee could not ascertain whether 21 deaths at Jaipur Golden Hospital happened because of oxygen shortage. Later, health minister Satyendar Jain said it was a “preliminary report”.In June, the Delhi government proposed another expert committee to ascertain the number of deaths caused by oxygen shortage in the Capital but Baijal did not approve, citing a similar committee set up by the Union government – eventually leading to a tussle between the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government and the LG, who is an appointee of the Centre.On August 16, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia sent a file to Baijal’s office for the second time, seeking approval for setting up the expert committee and sought Union home minister Amit Shah’s intervention.On August 20, Sisodia said the LG has once again rejected the Delhi government’s request for approval to set up the expert committee.Responding to the petition, the Delhi government has said that there is “no reasonable and lawful justification for objecting to the constitution of the committee or to prevent its functioning on a war footing at the earliest.It said that in two matters pending in the SC, which has been referred to by the LG while rejecting the committee, none have dealt with the grant of ex-gratia. It said that one of the suo moto matters on compensation was disposed of by the apex court asking the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to form guidelines to compensate for the losses.“There is no gainsaying that the second wave of the pandemic has wreaked havoc in the lives of the residents of Delhi and resulted in large scale casualties. While there can be no reparation for the loss of a loved one, the attempt of the answering respondent (Delhi government), an elected government responsible to the residents of the NCT, is to provide a means to establish accountability for the deaths,” the government said.In its response to the Sisodia’s comments on Friday, the LG office said that the claims were “misleading”, and that setting up another committee will create confusion. “Neither the LG nor the government of India has said that deaths due to oxygen shortage should not be probed. What has been said earlier on July 6, and repeated on August 19 is that a high level committee constituted as per SC directions, where apart from senior and reputed doctors, the ACS (health), the government of national capital territory of Delhi is also a member, is already looking into the matter. It has submitted its interim report and is working on the final report. The LG as well as the Union health minister have reiterated that the said committee should be allowed to do its work. Setting up another committee for the same purpose will only create confusion. The government has also been advised to follow the directions of hon’ble courts in the matter,” a senior officials at the LG’s office said on Friday.On Monday, the court gave two weeks to the LG to file his response to the petition, and posted the matter for hearing on September 21. During the hearing, two lawyers appeared for the LG, following which the court asked them to resolve the confusion among them.On the last date, the court asked the Delhi government to see whether ₹50,000 ex-gratia that the government promised to the family members of those who died of Covid-19 could be given to the woman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/oxygen-deaths-panel-delhi-govt-asks-lg-to-exercise-powers-judiciously-101629742167002.html
24-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi Drugs control dept advisory asks pharmacies to stock up on Covid medicines||The Delhi drugs control department has issued an advisory asking all city pharmacies to have a buffer stock of medicines needed for treating Covid-19, associated fungal infection mucormycosis (black fungus) and multi-inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), in anticipation of another surge in Covid cases.An expert panel, under the ministry of home affairs, has predicted a “third wave” in the country between September and October. If that happens, it would be Delhi’s fifth surge in Covid cases since the city’s first case was reported in March 2020. Currently, Covid-19 cases are at an all-time low, with Delhi reporting just 17 cases and no new death on Monday, according to the state’s daily health bulletin.The drugs control department advisory lists eight medicines of different doses, including the steroid dexamethasone, antiviral medicine remdesivir, immune modulator tocilizumab, and antifungal drugs amphotericin B and posaconazol.“As you are aware, the sudden rise in the number of cases during the recent surge posed a significant challenge in ensuring timely access to essential drugs for Covid-19 and Covid-associated mucormycosis (CAM)… You are hereby advised … maintenance of inventories of sufficient quantities of the drugs used in the management of Covid-19, CAM, and multi inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C),” read the advisory issued by Atul Nasa, head, office of Delhi’s drugs control department.The advisory to the drug manufacturer association and chemist association of Delhi further said, “You are further requested to advise them (the pharmacies) not to indulge in any unhealthy practice of withholding of stocks and overcharging for these items.”There was a severe shortage of medicines such as remdesivir and tocilizumab as well as medical oxygen in April-May, during the second wave (fourth in Delhi) of Covid-19 in the country. Hospitals also started receiving a high number of cases of the rare and deadly fungal infection mucormycosis (black fungus) in (recovered) Covid-19 patients in mid-May leading to a severe shortage of the life-saving antifungal medicine Amphotericin B, which is usually available in the market only in very small quantities.The situation had led to black-marketeers making a killing by offering to sell these medicines off the books, after hooking desperate patients and their kin online, and often supplying them with fake or bogus drugs in exchange for exorbitant amounts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-drugs-control-dept-advisory-asks-pharmacies-to-stock-up-on-covid-medicines-101629741808705.html
24-08-2021||Delhi||Arvind Kejriwal flags off smog tower to aid Capital's pollution fight||New Delhi: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday inaugurated a smog tower in Connaught Place as part of the drive to fight air pollution, which leads to a public health emergency in the Capital every winter.The tower, 24-metres high, located on Baba Kharak Singh Marg, has been designed using American technology, and has been put up on a trial basis, Kejriwal said. It is meant to pull in polluted air using suction fans located on the top of the structure, filter out the pollutants, and then release clean air from vents at the bottom.“This is among Delhi government’s many efforts to improve the air quality of the city. We are operating this on a trial basis and teams from Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) will be monitoring how effective this is,” Kejriwal said.“If it proves successful, more such towers will be set up all over Delhi. This has been developed under the expert supervision of scientists from IIT-Bombay and IIT-Delhi, so we are hopeful that it will yield the desired results,” he added.Last January, based on submissions made by the Delhi government and the Centre, the Supreme Court called fot the construction of two smog towers in the Capital on a pilot basis. One, which was inaugurated on Monday, was a Delhi government project; the other, which is coming up in east Delhi’s Anand Vihar, is being installed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). It is likely to be inaugurated by August 31.The smog tower at Connaught Place -- according to a statement issued by the Delhi government -- is based on a “downdraft airflow model”, where 40 huge fans will induct air from the top of a “special type of canopy structure at the height of about 24 metres, and release clean air of the tune of 1,000 metre cube per second filtered using round 5,000 filters through novel geometry filters of two layers”.The area of influence is expected to be about a 1km radius around the tower, Delhi government said.DPCC officials said that the effectiveness of the tower will be studied for the next two years, and the initial findings are likely to come out by the next month. IIT-Delhi and IIT-Bombay will analyse pollution data of the area after the installation of this tower and submit a report on its effectiveness.Experts unconvincedHowever, the inauguration of the smog tower reignited the ongoing debate on the efficacy of such open-air structures in cleaning a city’s air, with some experts calling them “ineffective”.Jyoti Pande Lavakare, author and co-founder of Care for Air India, said that the only way to reduce air pollution is to control emissions at the source; everything else is as good as “treating a bullet wound with a band-aid”.“If these smog towers were so effective, don’t you think countries like China and Mexico would have installed thousands of them and cleaned their air? There is no scientific evidence behind the efficacy of such outdoor structures, and all that this is doing is wasting the taxpayers’ money,” Pande contended.Sarath Guttikunda, director of Urban Emissions, an air pollution information, research and analysis repository, said that “vacuum cleaners are not engineering solutions to counter ambient air pollution”.In a research paper published by Guttikunda and Puja Jawahar, founder and co-director of Urban Emissions last year, the authors highlighted that the Covid-19 lockdown last year resulted in a major decline in pollution levels. This, the paper said, was proof that pollutants have to be plugged at the source.“With no boundaries, it is unscientific to assume that one can trap air, clean it, and release into the same atmosphere simultaneously. Expecting filtering units to provide any noticeable results at the community level is unrealistic,” the paper read.Other experts said the data should be studied assiduously.“While smog towers might come across as a visible solution to air pollution, there is no scientific evidence to support that they can filter outdoor air effectively. Hence, the data on the effectiveness of the newly installed smog tower should be pursued rigorously by the government and be made available publicly,” said Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead at Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).Political tussleThe inauguration of the tower, meanwhile, sparked a political tussle, with the Bharatiya Janata Party claiming that the Delhi government was “stealing credit” and “misleading people” by saying this was the first smog tower in the country.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that three smog towers set up by BJP MP Gautam Gambhir, and were operational in Delhi since last year. “East Delhi MP, Gautam Gambhir with his own effort last year on January 3, installed Delhi’s first smog tower at Lajpat Nagar and later in November 2020 got installed two other smog towers at Gandhi Nagar and Krishna Nagar. The way the Delhi government is claiming to have installed the first smog tower therefore clearly reflects its lust for publicity,” he said.The Delhi government did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cm-kejriwal-inaugurates-smog-tower-at-connaught-place-environmentalists-sceptical-of-its-efficacy-101629741749150.html
24-08-2021||Delhi||Victims of war: Afghans in India seek resettlement in third country||Armed with posters, placards and their national flag, hundreds of Afghan nationals gathered outside the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) office in Vasant Vihar on Monday to raise their demand for resettlement somewhere other than India.Holding placards reading “We were victims of war, now we are victims of an unclear future”, “Our children have a dark future because they have no access to higher education” and raising slogans like “We want future, we want a support letter”, protesters of all ages said that though they were grateful for being given refuge in India, they pointed out that they were unable to get jobs due to lack of educational qualifications, or study on account of expensive private education, and sought the UNHCR’s support to build a future elsewhere. They said they won’t leave the protest site till their demands are met.Rahila Malikzada (40), who first came to India in 2005, said that she was uncertain about her children’s future, even after 17 years of living here: “We don’t have any rights even after 17 years of living here. We don’t get jobs. Our children are unable to study here. We need a future. With the Taliban coming back, we can no longer return to our country. The UNHCR should give us a referral letter so that we can settle in another country.”Her husband used to work as a translator with hospitals but has been out of work since the last few months. The family withdrew their children from the school last year amid financial constraints. “We can barely make ends meet here. Since there is no clarity about our future in the country, UNHCR should help us resettle in another country,” said Malikzada.Ahmed Zia Ghani, head of the Afghan solidarity committee, an organisation representing the community in India, said that the return of the Taliban in Afghanistan had compounded troubles for Afghans everywhere. “Afghans in India also need support. The refugee agency and the Indian government should take steps to safeguard the human rights of Afghans,” said Ghani.He said the aim of the demonstration was three-fold: seek refugee cards for all Afghans in the country, seek referral letters that would aid resettlement to a third country, and ensure security for Afghans in India.Third country resettlement or refugee resettlement is, according to the UNHCR, one of three durable solutions for refugees who flee their home country. Resettlement under UNHCR, which allows a refugee to leaves his/her country of asylum and legally settle in another country, are determined by participating governments. Resettlement quotas of countries around the world can currently only include a tiny proportion of refugees worldwide (less than 1%), said UNHCR officials.India does not have a formal asylum system or a refugee policy, even though it has played host to refugees from different countries over the years. The country is not a signatory to 1951 UN Convention, a key international treaty establishing the rights of people forced to flee, and the 1967 Protocol, which broadened the scope of those in need of international protection. In the absence of a well-defined refugee law, refugees and asylum seekers are often subjected to inconsistent government policies. HT reached out to officials in the Ministry of Home Affairs for comment but there was no response.Holder a UN refugee card, Ajmal Rahimy (34), a native of Jalalabad in Afghanistan who came to India in 2007, said he has approached the UNHCR multiple times over the last 15 years for resettlement but to no avail.“There are Afghans who have lived in the country for 15-16 years now and hold the UN refugee card. At the same time, there are people whose refugee status has not been ratified and still remain an asylum seeker. Many are waiting endlessly. There is no clarity about our future here but our resettlement requests are turned down without adequate explanation,” said Rahimy.Azeeza Qadri (40), who came to India in 2017 and is currently residing in Malviya Nagar, can attest to the long wait. “We have applied for refugee status multiple times but our case has been closed. We want the UNHCR to open our case so that our children can study and have a future. The uncertainty about our future is causing a heavy mental toll now,” said Qadri, who has five children.Zuhail Hussain Khil (18) came to India along with her family from Afghanistan’s eastern city of Khost in 2017 in the face of Taliban threats aimed at her mother, who worked with the United Nations. “My mother has been constantly crying thinking about our country and our lives here. We need some stability in our lives,” said Khil.Explaining the family’s predicament, she shared how her brothers dropped out of school and have since depended on odd jobs for livelihood. “Since we are foreign citizens, education is extremely expensive for us here. My brothers could not complete their education and have no choice but to work in restaurants or other jobs where no degree is required,” she said.The protesters said that getting admission in government schools is a challenge as they demand a range of documents which are mostly not available with them.Her views are echoed by other Afghan refugees and asylum seekers in the country.Hafiza Nooryar (40), who came to the country in 2015 along with her family, said she has been struggling to make ends meet for the last six years.“My children are young and I cannot get well-paying jobs in the absence of educational qualifications...How will they survive like this?” said Nooryar, who hails from Kabul.Mariyam (19) came to India along with her family members in 2013 amid threats from her brother-in-law, a Taliban sympathiser. “We came to India due to the Taliban’s threat and now they are back in power. Our president left us in the lurch. Our hopes for peace and stability are over,” she said.The 19-year-old shared that the pandemic has worsened the financial crisis for the family and made survival in India more difficult. “Since our parents cannot speak in the regional languages of India, they can’t get jobs. We don’t want to meet a similar fate and desire to live in a country with a policy for refugees,” added Mariyam.While UNHCR officials did not respond to requests seeking comment, a notice issued by the UN agency on Thursday said that it had been receiving many inquiries from Afghans, adding that the resettlement programme will be accessible “only to those who meet eligibility criteria” and through the already established UNHCR procedures for identification and referral. “Resettlement remains a tool for the most vulnerable refugees, and only those most in need in the country of asylum may qualify,” stated the notice.In a separate statement, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo said, “In the context of generalised insecurity in many parts of Afghanistan, it is increasingly clear that Afghans outside the country may have international protection needs. UNHCR calls for all states to ensure they are able to seek safety, regardless of their current legal status.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/victims-of-war-afghans-in-india-seek-resettlement-in-third-country-101629741746692.html
24-08-2021||Lucknow||After 9-hr Taliban detention, UP man back home in Ghazipur village||Kanhaiyalal Sharma, a mechanical fitter who hails from Ghazipur district of Uttar Pradesh, had never thought that he was tough enough to handle the mental trauma and anxiety caused during a 9-hour-long detention under the Taliban in Afghanistan, to which Sharma and hundreds of other stranded Indian’s were subjected to. He finally reached India on Sunday, as part of a special repatriation operation by the Indian Air Force (IAF), bringing in 168 passengers including 107 Indians on its C-17 aircraft that touched down at Hindon airbase in Ghaziabad.“What I and the others underwent cannot be expressed in words. Just thinking about what we all went through is giving me goosebumps. I am thankful to the Indian government that brought us back safely,” an elated Sharma, who was on the way to Mubarakpur village of Ghazipur district, said. Sharma, who was working in a steel plant 5km from Kabul, said that though he managed to handle the trauma and anxiety, the experience has certainly left him traumatised. Sharma joined the factory recently in July. Along with him, there were 18 other UPites, who used to work together in a healthy environment. He said that there was not even the slightest apprehension of a crisis, until the Taliban returned.“The situation had left us clueless. I and the other 18 UPites were left with no option than to lock ourselves in the factory where we stayed for more than 72 hours. But that was no solution as our factory owners told us that they can’t keep them safe for long. But, they were kind enough to transport us to the nearby Gurudwara—Karte Parwan Gurudwara, 10km from Kabul Airport.“We were told that reaching the airport from here would be easy as compared to other locations. Hence, we were transported to the Gurudwara on August 20. We were also in touch with the embassy staff who told us to reach the airport’s north gate,” said Sharma.On August 20 itself, the kind Gurudwara management transported Sharma and the other Indians in five buses to the North Gate of the airport. “We thanked the Gurudwara people for their kindness and thought that it was the end of our struggle. But we were mistaken as it was then that the real struggle began,” he said. Sharma said they were greeted by mayhem at the airport — people running in panic, making futile attempts to enter the airport, while Taliban fighters were firing in the air and sometimes at the panicking crowd. “We were stopped by Taliban fighters 200 metres from the Gate since there was already a huge crowd at the gate. We were surrounded by the fighters and they pointed their guns at us. They said we can’t go further and gave us an option to return but we chose to stay,” recollects Sharma.Sharma said they waited for more than 12 hours at the North Gate of the airport. Following the prolonged waiting hours, he said that they were approached by two Taliban fighters who diverted the buses to an abandoned canteen that was recently captured by Taliban. “We thought it was the end of our journey. There were around 250 Indians there, who started crying, some started begging for life and some, like me, suffered panic attacks. But I tried to stay calm,” he said. He said that though the Taliban kept saying ‘you are safe’ but it was tough for the Indians to believe them, especially after seeing their gruesome videos on social media. “We stayed under their detention for around nine hours.Meanwhile, some of the detainees tweeted to the Indian government about the situation. I think it was after the intervention of the Indian government, they allowed us to go back to the airport,” he said.The five buses again moved to the airport but following some confusion, the buses were brought back again on the canteen premises. However, after a series of tweets to the Indian government, they were eventually guided to the airport. At the airport, which he said is still under the control of the US Army, they were allowed to enter the airport from where they boarded IAF’s C-17 aircraft. “It was an emotional moment when we all eventually boarded the aircraft and all shouted in unison—Bharat mata ki jai and we all broke into tears,” said an emotion-choked Sharma.Sharma reached his village Mubarakpur, Ghazipur, safely on Monday, where he received a warm welcome. Sharma said he has dropped all plans to move abroad and will stay in the village along with his mother, his wife and his three children until he heals from the trauma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/after-9-hr-taliban-detention-up-man-back-home-in-ghazipur-village-101629741626208.html
24-08-2021||Delhi||DDA receives 12,000 suggestions over Master Plan 2041||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) till Monday received over 12,000 comments and feedback on its draft Master Plan of Delhi-2041 (MPD-2041), which was put in the public domain in June this year.The last date for submission of comments is August 23, and DDA is expected to notify the plan by the end of the year.According to a senior DDA official, “Around 63,062 people have visited the portal and around 12,099 people have submitted their suggestions/objections. We are in the process of compiling all the comments, as people can submit them till today evening.” The official said 7,699 comments were received offline.A senior DDA official said, “We will hold public hearings most likely in October. It will be held online, but we are yet to work out the details.”The authority is compiling the comments under various categories based on the MPD chapters. DDA officials said that public hearings will be structured as per the issues raised by the people.The draft MPD-2041, which is the vision document for the city’s growth in the next two decades, proposes to make Delhi a 24x7 city with night-time economy, affordable housing, mixed development and Transit-Oriented Development.One of the key focus areas of the new master plan is to address the challenge of environmental pollution. However, the environmentalists say that the MPD has not specified steps on combating air pollution.Environmental activist Diwan Singh said, “They are talking about large-scale vertical development, especially in urban extensions which are currently green spaces. The real causes of air pollution have not been analysed properly by planners. There is no clear strategy given in the MPD to tackle air pollution. New developments, even if it is transit-oriented development, will only result in more traffic.”Singh said the master plan should clearly state that new projects can only be taken up if adequate water can be provided. “DDA should learn from its past experience and avoid a Dwarka-like situation in the future. The arrangement for water supply should be ensured before new development is allowed.”The draft master plan proposes to delineate Zone O based on one in 25 years flood line in the Yamuna. Environmentalist Manoj Misra, convener, Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan and petitioner in the Yamuna floodplain restoration case in NGT, said, “Lands in river (Zone O) and the ridge must be declared sacrosanct as eco-sensitive zones to meet the imminent climate challenge. The Yamuna must be rejuvenated as suggested by the National Green Tribunal in its judgment dated January 13, 2015, and the 20-point action plan prepared by the NGT mandated Yamuna Monitoring Committee.”It is for the first time that the master plan talks about providing affordable housing, including rental housing options. While experts have welcomed the DDA’s decision to provide rental housing, they say the plan needs to move beyond the affordable rental housing complexes scheme to think holistically about rentals in the city.Mukta Naik, a fellow at the Centre for Policy Research said, “The current provisions in the draft MPD-2041 might not be adequate to accommodate “vulnerable target groups” like migrant populations, the specially-abled, senior citizens, single women. We have suggested that DDA should set clear numerical targets and specify land reservations for affordable public rental housing based on the population of vulnerable groups in the city.”The resident welfare associations have raised concerns over rampant commercialisation in residential areas, increase in load on existing civic infrastructure and the safety of residents due to mixed land use provisions.Rajiv Kakria, convenor of Save Our City Campaign, said, “The draft MPD-2041 seems to be a document of hope rather than redemption. It fails to address the problems the city is grappling with. Mixed land use has ruined the residential character of neighbourhoods. The draft plan has no provision to incentivise commercial establishments operating from residential areas to move to commercial areas. There should be stringent norms and penalties to discourage commercial and even professional activity in residential areas.”Another issue raised by RWAs is the parking mess in residential colonies. B S Vohra, president of East Delhi Joint RWA Front said that the parking policy, especially for residential areas, needs to be clearly specified. “Parking is a serious concern in most residential colonies. The parking policy, which was introduced a few years back, has failed to address the parking problem in residential areas. Like MPD-2021, this draft plan also doesn’t offer any solution to the parking problem.”The draft MPD-2041 pushes for regeneration, transit-oriented development, planned commercial spaces etc. But the traders said that the draft plan is not in sync with the ground realities.Traders said that neighbourhood markets should be provided higher Floor Area Ratio so that it can cater to a larger population which can just walk or cycle to the market. Vishal Ohri, general secretary, LSCs Federation of Delhi and GK-2 Market Association said, “But this has been ignored in the draft plan. The population of the residential neighbourhood has increased four times since 1962. To meet the growing demand, the FAR of residential units has been doubled over the years. But the FAR of local shopping complexes has been increased from 250 to 350. We have suggested that the FAR of SCs should also be doubled.”He added, “If more local commercial space is created at walking distance from residential areas, then people will prefer to walk or cycle to the market for daily needs which in return means less traffic on the roads, less pollution, less parking chaos, etc.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ddareceives-12-000-suggestions-over-master-plan-2041-101629741326051.html

24-08-2021||Pune||Over 55K duplicate voter entries removed; photos of 92K updated in 6 mths||Pune district election officials have managed to remove more than 55,000 duplicate voter entries and updated the photographs of about 92,000 voters in the last six months. The process of updating and revising the voter list began a month after publication of the final voter list in January 2021. Pune district has a total 7,887,874 voters.On January 15 this year, there were 406,589 voters in the district without photographs, with the number being reduced to 313,939 in August as per the latest figures provided by district election officials.Mrinalini Sawant, deputy district election officer, said, “We undertook this huge task which had been pending for many years. In the non-election period, we keep on updating the voter list. But two waves of covid-19 have proved to be hurdles. Now again we have started revising the voters’ list. During the past few months, we conducted regular meetings and encouraged officials to update voter data.”Updating voters’ photographs in the voters’ list will help booth officers identify genuine voters at the time of elections. District administration also undertook the task of identifying and removing demographically similar entries (DSEs), commonly known as duplicate voters. On January 15, there were 88,724 DSEs or duplicate voters, with the number being reduced by 55,889 to 32,835 in August.Sawant said, “Some people have their names in the voters’ lists of other districts as well, which should not be the case. So by coordinating with other districts, we have identified such voters. It requires field visits to voters where they are asked at which place they would like to keep their name and accordingly, the entry is updated.”Election officials have also approached 119 big industries and corporate houses in the Pune district to start voter awareness forums for their employees. Based on updation of voters’ lists, a draft roll will be published in November and the final number of newly-added voters will be known only at that time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/over-55k-duplicate-voter-entries-removed-photos-of-92k-updated-in-6-mths-101629737125607.html
24-08-2021||Pune||DLSA to run “job fair” to connect unskilled labour with MIDC units in Pune||The Principal District Judge of Pune, SA Deshmukh, has announced an initiative by the District legal service authority (DLSA) to provide employment to unskilled labourers who lost jobs during the pandemic, in an effort to bridge the gap between labout and industry in MIDC areas, where there is a dire need for labourers.The forms for registering will be available at the DLSA office on the Shivajinagar court premises, first floor of the new court building, until September 9.“It was suggested to us to take substantial steps for providing employment to those who lost their livelihoods during the lockdown. We are planning a job fair for the labourers who can be hired directly into industries located in Chakan MIDC. This job fair will provide the much-needed opportunity for livelihood for those who need it. This initiative is as per the Mumbai High Court directions to take steps in this direction,” said Judge Deshmukh.The initiative will be launched will help from Symbiosis Law School, Divine Jain Group trust, and Lalita Motilal Sankla Foundation. Credai will also be roped in and asked to raise awareness among labourers and later, choose from those who have applied.DLSA is primarily looking to provide the required 90- day experience certificate to unskilled labourers in order to get benefits of government schemes. The effort is looking to generate an immediately recruitable pool of construction workers, security guards, and housekeeping staff.“The 90-day experience certificate makes the unskilled eligible for 23 government schemes including housing subsidy, health insurance, schooling for children, marriage, higher education for children and labourers. Once they are recruited through this pool that we will create, they will be able to get the 90-day experience certificate which can be provided to them directly by DLSA,” said Pratap Sawant, Secretary, DLSA.Sunny Motilal Sankla, a businessman from Chakan MIDC, said that the need for labourers in Chakan, Talegaon, Ranjangaon MIDC areas is immense.“Right now, we are working in two shifts because of the shortage of labourers. Once we get more labourers, we will be able to function in three shifts like before. The difference will be that the respective companies will take full responsibility of the labourers’ needs like food, shelter. And this will ensure absence of middlemen in the process,” he said.He added that the three MIDC areas collectively have 1,800 companies with major companies like Amazon, Flipkart, and major automobile production units.Dr Shashikala Gurupurji, dean, Symbiosis Law School, said, “We will provide the manpower to handle the legal work. This is necessary for society, where unskilled labourers have suffered a lot.”The awareness and outreach work has been started by 23 volunteer lawyers attached to DLSA and Sanket Shah led Divine Jain Group Trust NGO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/dlsa-to-run-job-fair-to-connect-unskilled-labour-with-midc-units-101629736945621.html
24-08-2021||Pune||Pune civic body to conduct first survey to record non-communicable diseases in city||As Covid-19 put the focus on the health department and health infrastructure, the Pune Municipal corporation (PMC) will soon start its first ever survey to trace and record non-communicable diseases in the city. This would be part of the national health programme which surveys pregnant women for antenatal care, post-delivery care for mother and child and fertile couples. This is the first of its kind survey in the city following the central government guidelines in view of the role of comorbidities in Covid-19 deaths. The survey would begin from Tuesday and would continue till October 14. As per the Pune district health office information, of the 18,538 deaths reported due to Covid-19, 67.9% reported to have an associated risk factor, which is 12,593 deaths and 32.1%, while 5,945 did not report any risk factor. A high number of deaths were reported in people who also reported other comorbidities especially diabetes, high blood pressure and hypertension. Dr Vaishali Jadhav, assistant health officer said, “This is the first time the PMC is conducting this survey and it would help us record all non-communicable diseases like diabetes, cancer, blood pressure, hypertension, cardio-vascular diseases, blood pressure and also body mass Index. We have received a proper format from the government as to how to conduct this survey and which ailments would be covered. This would be part of the other surveys under the national health programme which are usually conducted in April-May, however, due to the pandemic we postponed it.” Earlier the state government had conducted a statewide ‘My family, My responsibility’ survey under which a health survey was conducted to look out for comorbidities in people. However, it was based on oral responses and mostly looked for flu- like symptoms for detecting Covid-19 cases. “We would also have NCD consultants who would make sure that we implement the survey properly and the NCD clinics are also in place effectively. The survey would be conducted by about 300 nurses who would do this everyday, except on days of Covid-19 vaccination, starting from Tuesday till October 14,” added Jadhav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-conduct-first-survey-to-record-non-communicable-diseases-in-city-residents-101629736406027.html
24-08-2021||Pune||Anticipating third wave, Maharashtra govt ensuring enough medicines, beds available||With the NITI Aayog’s latest report predicting a third Covid-19 wave in September, with a surge in cases and an eventual load on health infrastructure, the state government has started preparing for the anticipated surge by instructing district administrations to prepare for 1.5 times the number of active cases at the peak of the second wave. The Pune Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) officials said they have been asked to monitor medicine stock available in Pune market right now, which seems to be surplus as demand is low. According to Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope, the state government has started preparing for increased oxygen supply, and medicines for children. “We are fully prepared to tackle next wave based on the directions given by centre,” said Tope in Jalna. Dr Pradip Awate, state surveillance officer said, “The NITI Aayog report might have come now, but we have been preparing for the anticipated third wave right after the second wave started to ebb. There are regular financial approvals being made by the state. We have asked every district to prepare for the third wave with respect to the number of patients that could be reported. We are preparing for about 1.5 times the number of patients that the state saw during the peak of the second wave. For example if we reported a 100 active cases on a particular day during the second wave peak, then this time we have asked the districts to prepare for150 active cases in a day. Of this we anticipate that 65% would require home isolation and remaining 35% would require hospitalisation divided into ICU care, ventilators and also oxygenation. So we have asked district’s to ramp up their infrastructure as per this requirement.” The state saw its peak of the second wave on April 22, with 699,858 active cases. The anticipation would be that the state would see 1,049,787 at the peak of a third wave, if it ever comes, with a much higher severity. He further added, “Also this time we have reserved some beds for paediatric Covid-19 cases since the anticipation is that the third wave would affect children the most. So we have asked districts to reserve 15% beds in the Covid care centre for paediatric cases, which is anyone below 18 years of age; 10% for those with moderate symptoms and 5% for severe paediatric Covid-19 cases.” S V Pratapwar, assistant commissioner of FDA said, “As of now there are no restrictions on the purchase of Covid-19 or mucormycosis drugs and so it is freely available with private chemists and stockists. If we talk about Pune district we have about 40,000 remdesivir vials and the demand has fallen down to single digits number in a week. We have about 25,000 tocilizumab vials and we have demand of about 10-15 vials in a month. For mucormycosis we have about 2,000 amphotericin vials available and the demand has gone down to 8/10 daily. All these drugs have been de-regulated now and remdesivir was also removed as a prescribed treatment drug for Covid-19, however, it is still prescribed by doctors’ as per their discretion.” Pune district saw its highest active case load on April 19 when the number reached 125,096 active cases. As per Pune district’s information, in the second wave alone, from April 12, to August 18, 2021, Pune district saw a supply of 201,113 vials of remdesivir, 258 vials of tocilizumab (400 mg) 2,084 vials of tocilizumab (80 mg) and a total of 57,790 vials of amphotericin B injections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/anticipating-third-wave-state-ensuring-enough-medicines-beds-available-101629736405504.html
24-08-2021||Kolkata||CBI starts probe into Bengal poll violence||Days after a Calcutta high court order, officials of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in Kolkata on Monday began its probe into cases of murder, attempts to murder and rape reported during the post-poll violence in West Bengal as four of its special teams from Delhi were yet to arrive in the state.A team of sleuths belonging to the central agency recorded the statement of Biswajit Sarkar, brother of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker Abhijit Sarkar who was allegedly killed by Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers in Kolkata’s Narkeldanga area, shortly after the assembly election results were announced on May 2. He was the only BJP worker to have been killed in the state capital. “We will definitely get justice,” Biswajit said as he left the CBI office at CGO complex in Salt Lake on Monday afternoon. He was brought to the complex by a team of CBI officials earlier in the day and was questioned for around two hours. “After the poll results were announced, TMC workers tied a television wire around my brother’s neck and dragged him along the road. They smashed his head with a stone. The police did not register a complaint even though we pleaded several times,” Biswajit had said on August 19. The BJP worker’s brother also alleged that his family was threatened by the police who said that they would decide on the names of the accused in the case. “We refused to comply,” he added. Two persons -- Sanjay Dev (26) and Avijit Dev (25) -- were arrested in connection with the murder case on July 24. The accused are residents of Mahesh Barick Lane in Narkeldanga. Seven of the eight persons named in the FIR have been nabbed so far, a senior Kolkata Police officer said on condition of anonymity.On July 13, the Calcutta high court directed the Central Forensic Science Laboratory to conduct a DNA test on the body to identify the victim.Lawyer Priyanka Tibrewal, who represented the petitioner in court, said, “The DNA report has been submitted. It is in the custody of the court. Since the victim’s body is still lying in a morgue, we will appeal for its release for the last rites once the CBI is done with the investigation.” Soon after the TMC swept the assembly elections on May 2, the BJP made allegations of widespread post-poll violence from across the state. Biswajit was among the several petitioners who moved the Supreme Court for a probe into the alleged violence. The apex court allowed the Calcutta high court to look into the matter. Following directions from the high court on June 18, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) carried out an investigation and submitted its final report on July 13, recommending a CBI probe and trials outside the state.After studying the NHRC’s final report, the high court last week ordered separate probes by the CBI and a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the state police into the alleged violence. A five-judge bench headed by acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal said the CBI will probe the serious allegations of rape and murder and a three-member SIT those of arson and loot under the court’s supervision. Four special teams, comprising seven members each, are slated to arrive in the state this week to take charge of complaints from north, south, west and Kolkata zones, respectively, people familiar with the development said, adding that separate FIRs would be filed for each allegation of rape and murder.The state government has maintained that the NHRC report was biased and prepared with a political motive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/cbi-records-statement-of-kin-of-bjp-worker-killed-in-kolkata-poll-violence-101629719424983.html
24-08-2021||Bhopal||Row over video’s authenticity after 16 booked for sedition||Days after the police booked 16 people on sedition charges for allegedly shouting “Pakistan zindabad” during a Muharram procession in Ujjain, a debate has broken out over the authenticity of the video clip on the basis of which the police acted.On Monday, the Muharram procession’s organisers released a 2.20-minutevideo in which people can be heard shouting “qazi sahab zindabad”. The Ujjain police then released a 10-minute clip of the same event in which people can be heard shouting “Pakistan zindabad” and “qazi sahab zindabad” .Ujjain superintendent of police Satyendra Shukla said, “We have taken action only on the basis of an authentic video shot by police personnel and officers of the district administration. We have no doubt on the authenticity. The incident happened at 10.12pm and we registered a case on the basis of video within half an hour.”“Earlier too, such incidents have been reported from the area, and this time we recorded the procession,” Shukla added.The video has been forwarded to the state’s home department.The organisers have a different story.“The police morphed the video. No anti-national slogans were shouted by the people present,” said Muzeeb Qazi, an organiser of the Muharram procession in Ujjain’s Geeta Colony.Backing Qazi’s claims, Congress’s Rajya Sabha MP Digvijaya Singh said, “Police took action on a fake video clip. They should have verified the truth first. The case should be withdrawn.”A Congress municipal councillor Maya Trivedi, who was present at the programme, said: “Nobody shouted anti-national slogans and the case was registered on the basis of a fake video.”Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra said, “We don’t have any doubt about the video. Such anti-national and people inspired by Taliban mentality should be punished.”Calling Digvijaya Singh a “Pakistani agent”, the state’s medical education minister Vishwas Sarang said, “Why does Digvijaya Singh always feel offended when it comes to Pakistan and anti-national activities? The Congress is trying to create communal tension, but we won’t allow them.”The Ujjain police on Friday booked 16 residents of Geeta Colony under sections 124 A (sedition), 153 B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration) and 188 (violation of order duly promulgated by officer) of the Indian Penal Code; 10 of them have been arrested so far, police said.Reacting to the incident, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan earlier said his government would not tolerate a “Taliban-like” mindset.District collector Ashish Singh on Sunday invoked the National Security Act (NSA) against four of the accused.(With inputs from Anand Nigam from Ujjain)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/pakistan-zindabad-case-cong-says-video-clip-fake-police-refute-claim-101629718947401.html
24-08-2021||Mumbai||ED files charge sheet against Anil Deshmukh’s personal assistant, private secy||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday filed a charge sheet against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh’s personal secretary Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde in the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court. Deshmukh is the main accused in the money laundering case.The agency arrested Palande and Shinde on June 26, claiming they handled the money laundering linked to Deshmukh’s alleged bribe-cum-extortion business. Both have been charged with relevant sections of PMLA. ED said in the past that the two were not cooperating with the agency.The money laundering case against Deshmukh and his aides was registered after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a first information report (FIR) against him on April 21.Also Read | Maharashtra registers 4,141 fresh Covid cases on Sunday, Mumbai records 1 deathThe central agency alleged that while serving as the home minister, Deshmukh misused his position, and through assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze – who has now been dismissed and is in Taloja jail for his alleged role in the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran murder cases – collected ₹4.7 crore from Mumbai’s bars for their “smooth functioning”. Later, through hawala channels, this money was sent to two brothers in Delhi who operated bogus companies, said the agency. It claimed that on Deskmukh’s son Hrishikesh’s behest, the two brothers diverted the money as donations to Nagpur-based Shri Sai Shikshan Sansthan, an educational trust controlled by the Deshmukhs. ED alleged that both Palande and Shinde played an important role in circulating and laundering the unaccounted money. During investigation, ED identified 24 private entities that are controlled by the Deshmukh family and found that huge sums of money were transacted among them without any rationale. “...thus it can be said that these series of transactions were meant for inflating balance sheets and layering of money from one company to other,” ED said. In mid-July, the anti-money laundering agency has provisionally attached Deshmukh’s properties worth ₹4.2 crore. The attached assets include a residential flat in Worli valued at ₹1.54 crore and 25 land parcels of book value ₹2.67 crore at Dhutum village at Uran in the neighbouring Raigad district. Praful Patel visits ED officeSenior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Praful Patel visited the Enforcement Directorate (ED) office on Monday. After visiting the ED office in the afternoon, he said he was called to sign documents in case of a property seizure. “I was there to sign documents as ED had seized a property of Ceejay House building a few years ago, which is owned by someone else. As the building is in our possession I was called to sign some documents.

The thrashing incident, a video of which went viral on social media, took place on Sunday when the complainant, Taslim Ali, was selling bangles in the Govind Nagar area, police added. According to Ali, a resident of Uttar Pradesh, he was accosted by a group of unidentified men who started thrashing him after finding out that he was a Muslim. He added that a First Information Report (FIR) was registered late on Sunday only after a few members belonging to his community staged a protest outside Banganga police station.“After asking my name, they frisked me and abused me. Later, they brutally thrashed me. They also looted ₹10,000 from me. I went to the police station but they did not lodge my complaint till late evening,” Ali alleged. Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra claimed that the victim was using a fake identity, passing himself as Hindu. “The man was selling bangles by changing his name. People recovered two Aadhaar cards from his possession with a Hindu name and thrashed him. But they cannot take law into their own hands, so we have registered a case against them.”A total of 14 people were booked in the FIR which was registered under section 141 (unlawful assembly), 147 (punishment for rioting) 147 (using criminal force), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 294 (using obscene language) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code. Police have also booked 12 people for creating ruckus at the police station. A police force has been deployed in the area as a precautionary measure. “We registered an FIR only after confirming the incident. We will identify the culprits to nab them soon. We have also registered a case against the protesters for not maintaining peace,” Indore inspector general of police HN Mishra said.Ashutosh Bagri, superintendent of police, Indore east, said: “There was no delay in registering the FIR. After recording the statement of eyewitnesses and the complainant, an FIR was registered.” Late in the evening, police said a 13-year-old girl filed a complaint alleging Ali introduced himself as “Golu, son of Mohan Singh” to sell bangles at her home on Sunday and after describing her as “very beautiful”, he touched her inappropriately.When the girl raised an alarm, her mother rushed out of home and when the bangle seller tried to escape from the spot, neighbours and other local residents caught and thrashed him, police added.Based on the girl’s complaint, a case under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) and IPC sections 420 (cheating) and 471 (using fake documents as real ones), among others, was registered against Ali, the police said.“Cops have found two Aadhaar cards of different names from the carry bag of Ali besides a burnt voter identity card in which his name was not clear. But in the column of father’s name, ‘Mohan Singh’ is printed on it,” said Bagri.The Congress accused the police of harassing the minorities. “Police in Madhya Pradesh are harassing minority community members. They register cases against members of the minor community but not on their complaints. The man was beaten up because he is a Muslim. The police registered the case hours after the incident. Now, they should hold an unbiased investigation and arrest the accused soon,” state Congress Committee spokesperson Ajay Yadav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mob-thrashes-bangle-seller-in-mp-s-indore-14-booked-101629707783773.html
24-08-2021||Mumbai||At Malabar Hill in Mumbai, 700-m walkway with a view of Arabian Sea||In the next nine months, citizens will get a 700-meter-long walkway at Malabar Hill to get a bird’s eye view of the Arabian Sea. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has floated bids for construction of the walkway at a cost of ₹12 crore. According to BMC officials, citizens will be charged a nominal entry fee for using this wooden walkway that will be constructed in lush greenery near Hanging Garden. The walkway will be located near Babulnath Temple and will wind through the hill forest giving unobstructed scenic views of the Arabian Sea and the bustling city. The design for the forest trail at Malabar Hill is expected to be constructed without cutting any tree considering the concept is to build in lush greenery. There are around eight types of trees on the site, including gulmohar, almond (desi badam), copperpod, mango, coconut, rain tree, jamun and jackfruit. The lush greenery is also home to several birds and is expected to be having a lot of visitors who are bird watchers. Mumbai-based architect Rahul Kadri of IMK Architects who has worked on the design of the project said, “The city has several skywalks, but there are no elevated leisure walkways. From the ground, the trail will be raised by at least 2m and is likely to reach an estimated 10m in accordance with the forest’s changing contours. We have incorporated benches, viewing decks and a glass-bottom look-out zone at its widest point to further enhance the experience. Minimal lighting will be incorporated in the handrail to just keep it enough to light the trail without spilling into the forest and disturbing the native animal species.” According to the tender floated by the BMC, a ticket counter and public toilet will also be constructed on the site. A BMC official said, “A nominal entry fee will be levied on the visitors for the upkeep of the walkway and also to ensure that we have genuine visitors. We are expecting that the walkway will easily handle more than 100 visitors at a time.” Considering the landslide in the vicinity a year ago, the BMC officials said during the soil investigations for the project, they have also considered those aspects in order to decide on the construction modalities. The BMC is expected to finalise the contractor for construction by the end of this month and the work for the project is expected to start by the end of September. The BMC has given eight months duration for the contractor to complete the work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/at-malabar-hill-in-mumbai-700-m-walkway-with-a-view-of-arabian-sea-101629314864646.html
