All the beds at the centre will be equipped with ventilators and a team of specialists will be present round-the-clock to provide immediate care to Covid-19 patients even before they are admitted, said hospital officials. The centre will ensure that patients receive appropriate care during a Covid-19 emergency, even while waiting for admissions, in what is a step-up from the holding areas demarcated at all Delhi government-run hospitals during the pandemic. The holding areas were meant to provide basic care and oxygen support while admission-related formalities were completed. “Treatment for Covid-19 will begin even before admission — no one will have to wait... All the beds are equipped with transport [moveable] ventilators, so that the patients can be moved to the ward on the same machine,” Jain said at the inauguration. In a tweet, the minister said, “Under the guidance of CM @ArvindKejriwal to combat the next covid wave, Delhi Govt has made a Rapid Response Center at Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital. This will be manned with a Rapid Response Team which will work 24×7 and will help in better management of covid patients.” Delhi is planning to create 37,000 beds, of which 12,000 would be intensive care unit beds, in preparation for a future wave of the pandemic. During the fourth surge in cases between April and May in Delhi, a peak of over 20,000 patients with the viral infection were hospitalised across the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-health-min-jain-lifts-curtains-off-30-bed-rapid-response-centre-for-covid-patients-at-rajiv-gandhi-hospital-101629916155368.html

However, outgoing president of the gurdwara body, SAD’s Manjinder Singh Sirsa, lost to former president Harvinder Singh Sarna in a fierce contest from the Punjabi Bagh seat. Polls were held on August 22. Top leaders of SAD said they view Wednesday’s victory as a precursor to the upcoming Punjab assembly elections, scheduled to be held in early 2022. Sarnas led SAD (Delhi) won 14 seats, while former DSGMC president Manjit Singh GK, who fielded candidates from the newly formed Jago party, shrunk to three seats, including GK’s home seat of Greater Kailash. Independents won two seats. Addressing a press conference in New Delhi, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal felicitated the Sikhs of Delhi for voting his party back to power and announced that Sirsa would continue to head the body even if he has lost the polls. “He (Sirsa) will be nominated from quota of (Amritsar-headquartered) Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC),” Sukhbir told media persons. With an annual budget of at least ₹110 crore and the management of nine historical gurdwaras, apart from schools, colleges and hospitals, the DSGMC is a powerful body with a say in the global matters of the Sikh community, and a voice in the government at the state and Centre. The head of the DSGMC is the leader of eight lakh Sikhs living in the national capital and also the Sikhs living outside the state of Punjab and abroad. The committee also proactively takes up matters concerning the Sikh diaspora. The DSGMC under Sirsa had won the hearts of Delhi residents during second wave of the Covid-19 for the manner in which it reached out to patients with medical support, oxygen cylinders and concentrators. The body also set up langars (community kitchens) during the lockdown, thereby helping SAD regain popularity within the community. “I know that both governments (Centre and Delhi) worked against our party, particularly Sirsa, but despite that opposition we won,” said Sukhbir. It takes a month for the constitution of the house, he said. As per the DSGMC Act of 1971, the 51-member house runs the gurdwara body. Apart from the 46 elected members, there is a provision to nominate one member (from SGPC quota), two members via co-option and two more from the Singh Sabhas (local gurdwaras) of Delhi. For SAD (Delhi) president Paramit Singh Sarna results came as a shock. “We were hopeful of doing much better, but the final say is of the voters, which we accept,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/badalsled-sad-wins-dsgmc-polls-for-a-third-consecutive-term-bags-27-of-46-seats-101629916153585.html

The court has asked them to appear before it on September 22.ED has, in May, filed a charge sheet against all the 21 accused. Special PMLA judge MG Deshpande in a detailed order said, “MIAL had allegedly entered into bogus contract of ₹310 crore during 2017-2018 with nine firms/companies, but against the same, no work was executed.”Referring to the ED charge sheet, the court said overdraft facility (OD) against surplus funds totalling ₹395 crore were remaining with MIAL after sharing revenue with the Airport Authority of India (AAl) and after deducting expenses kept as fixed deposit receipts (FDR) with public sector undertaking (PSU) banks, MIAL diverted the same to other group of companies.ED also alleged that MIAL inflated expenditure by paying salary of GVK employees from its revenues, and also rented out premium retail areas in Mumbai airport to family members, relatives and employees of GVK at very low rates, thereby reducing revenues. In this way, ₹705 crore were fraudulently siphoned off from MIAL, resulting loss to AAI and corresponding wrongful gain to GVK Airports Holding Ltd, said the court.The court said these allegations are corroborated by documentary evidence and hence it felt that prima facie, a case of money laundering as defined under section 3 and punishable under section 4 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 was made out and there is sufficient grounds to issue process.ED had filed the complaint through special prosecutor Kalpana Patil. AAI, which managed the city airport, had entered into an agreement with MIAL in 2006, allowing them to operate, manage and develop Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (T-2). Accordingly, MIAL was to share 38.7% earnings with AAI and keep the rest for modernisation and extension of the airport.ED has already attached land parcel in Tamil Nadu owned by GVK in November, 2020. The said land, valued at ₹509 crore, was purchased from crime proceedings, the agency said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pmla-court-issues-process-against-gvk-airport-developers-mial-sanjay-reddy-101629915974319.html

However, the city was hit with second wave days later with cases starting to increase from February 2021. According to BMC officials, a policy for khau gallis was to be framed but there is no development on the same as the plan is on hold for now.HT had, on February 14, reported had reported that BMC identified 65 locations wherein 3,331 vendors will be accommodated. These vendors can also be in the form of food trucks or normal stalls. This plan is an extension to BMC’s plan to have food trucks across the city, for which it had prepared a draft policy last year.The idea of food trucks was pushed by state tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray who announced having food trucks across the city to boost tourism. In the 2021-22 budget, BMC reserved ₹200 crore for creating food hubs including beautification of footpaths, beautifying space below flyovers etc.BMC officials said after initial discussion in January, a policy was to be formulated wherein 10-12 trucks, selling different cuisines, will come and park trucks between 6pm and 11pm. For this, several wards in the city are looking at small streets which BMC can afford to shut between 6pm and 11pm and divert traffic to alternative routes.A senior BMC official not wishing to be named said, “Several wards in the western suburbs had also submitted their plan to the Mumbai Traffic Police (MTP) to get no objection certificate for temporarily shutting service roads for food trucks and stalls. These wards had also got the required permission from the traffic police.”Another BMC official from the license department which will frame the policy said, “Before the second wave hit the city, we were consulting with health department regarding such a plan, but since then the planning has been on hold owing to second wave. And now we also fear a third wave. Any policy on such an issue may now be drafted only once substantial population of the city is vaccinated.”Meanwhile, the hospitality industry feels they should be consulted before such a policy is implemented. Pradeep Shetty, senior vice-president of Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), said, “Our industry is the most impacted due to the Covid lockdown, and business has been hit for hotel industry since the past 15 months. We expect that such a policy is drafted after taking suggestion from hospitality industry to ensure there is level playing ground.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/second-covid-19-wave-hit-bmc-s-khau-galli-plan-101629915675142.html

They two were found in possession of and consuming cocaine, ganja and charas, which was not of commercial quantity, during a birthday party at a bungalow in Igatpuri.The court, however, held that it was necessary for the young generation, who follow the principle of ‘now or never’ to be informed about the perils of such addiction. The court granted the duo bail as they did not have any antecedents of being suppliers or drug peddlers. However, they were warned that if found with drugs again, the bail would be cancelled, and they would be dealt with as per law. The single bench of justice Bharati Dangre, while hearing the bail applications of two young men, who had been booked and arrested by Igatpuri police during a raid on June 27, for consuming and possessing drugs during a party in a rented bungalow was informed by senior advocate Aabad Ponda that the search of the duo had resulted in the recovery of contraband which was not of commercial quantity, hence section 37 of the NDPS Act could not be applied to them. Ponda further submitted that the raiding party had not complied with the provisions of section 50, which requires the search of the person to be conducted in the presence of a gazetted officer or a magistrate. He submitted that as the officer who searched the accused claimed to be a gazetted officer without telling him that he had a right to seek the presence of another gazette officer, thus there was a lapse on the part of the raiding party. Lastly, Ponda submitted that the claim of the prosecution that traces of the contraband was found in the swimming pool could not be used to claim that it was put there by the accused nor the assumption of the forensic lab could be accepted that as traces were found in the sample water it could be attributed to being above non-commercial quantity. In light of these submissions and the fact that the duo was young and was possessing drugs for personal consumption, and they had already spent time in jail with hardened criminals, to avoid getting influenced by other inmates they should be granted bail. The additional public prosecutor relied upon circumstantial evidence and the forensic lab report to oppose the bail applications. After hearing the submissions the bench observed, “Considering their young age where they are in a stage of reformation, they deserve one opportunity by restoring their freedom, nevertheless with a forewarning that if they indulge in such activity in future, the law will not spare them and, in any case, at the outcome of the trial, if they are found guilty, they shall undergo the prescribed penalty for indulging in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substance as prescribed under the NDPS Act.” The court further observed, “It is true that the youth of today leads a lifestyle, where he believes in a cheerful present limiting to ‘now or never’ without thinking of consequences to follow. Adolescence and youth are the phases of a lifetime, where the aking of irrational and impulsive decisions may be favoured by some. The challenge of today mainly focuses on the issue of drug addiction in youth and how to tackle it.” The court then proceeded to grant bail to the duo on furnishing a personal bond of ₹50,000 each with sureties in like amount and also directed them to visit Igatpuri police station twice a week and restrained them from leaving the country without the prior permission of the special NDPS court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/must-inform-youth-about-perils-of-addiction-says-bombay-hc-grants-bail-to-duo-held-with-drugs-101629915674167.html

The meeting followed a jan akrosh morcha called by AMMKS held at Azad Maidan which was attended by at least 1,000 members of the fisherfolk community.Community leaders expressed resentment after their meeting with joint commissioner Ramesh Pawar. “We had asked to meet with Iqbal Chahal, but instead we were granted an audience with Mr Pawar. We demanded that the fish markets Crawford Market and Dadar to be re-established on sight, at the earliest. This is non-negotiable. We were told that the matter is the state government’s responsibility. There were no resolutions today,” said Devendra Tandel, president, AMMKS.When asked, Pawar said, “Market department is not with me.”The delegation led by Tandel later met with minister for textiles, fisheries and port development Aslam Sheikh, who assured the delegation of an equitable settlement between the fisherfolk and BMC. “Shaikh told us that the issue fall entirely within the remit of BMC, and that he will speak to the municipal commissioner. Our only demand is that we get back our evicted lands and fish markets,” Tandel said. He added that various fishing societies across the state — which also depend on Crawford Market for business — will wait 10 days to hear back from BMC with a concrete resolution, failing which a more aggressive protest will be mounted.In July this year, BMC had demolished the Chhatrapati Shivaji fish market within the Jyotiba Phule Market, also known as Crawford Market, after the building was deemed to be hazardous. Subsequently, Meenatai Thackeray fish market in Dadar was also demolished following longstanding complaints of traffic jams near Senapati Bapat Marg. “Chhatrapati Shivaji market is the heart of our business. Fish from all over the state comes there, and we go to collect it. Without that market, the fish business in Mumbai cannot survive. BMC has offered us a space in Airoli, but over there we are facing competition from established fisherwomen. Besides, it is too far away. It costs us double the fare to travel there as compared to Crawford Market. There are no bathrooms, no drinking water. The area is a marshy jungle and we don’t feel safe at all,” said Manda Guru Salian, a fisherwoman from Cuffe Parade who was present at the protest.Prior to demolition, Chhhatrapati Shivaji wholesale fish market reported a daily turnover of ₹5 crore and directly supported livelihoods of 157 fisherwomen, 87 wholesalers and 36 suppliers. “These are just the licensed operators. Indirectly, the market supports over a 1,000 fish workers. You cannot expect all of them to just leave their customary area and start trade elsewhere. Existing relationships with clients will be ruined,” said Tandel.Dadar fishmarket, meanwhile, was a wholesale venue for freshwater fish, a business dominated by migrants from West Bengal and adjacent states. Roughly 36 Koli fisherwomen were conducting their business there and have now been moved to a fish market in Marol, where they report facing stiff competition and from existing traders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fisherfolk-meet-bmc-fisheries-minister-for-re-establishing-fish-markets-101629915254112.html
25-08-2021||Mumbai||Another semester online for medical students enrolled in Chinese varsities?||With merely weeks left before the beginning of the new semester, Indian students enrolled in medical courses in China are now gearing up for yet another semester online. Their efforts to complete their course in their college in China have not borne fruits yet. “In a couple of weeks, our new semester will kick-off. There has been no communication from the university regarding international students’ return to campuses. As medical students, we have already completed three semesters online, without any practical experience,” said a third-year medical student, on the condition of anonymity. In June, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) issued a notice in favour of students studying in international universities, stuck in India due to the pandemic. MEA asked such students to write to its Overseas Indian Affairs (OIA) office about difficulties in reaching out to their university. “Indian students studying abroad who are stuck in India owing to Covid-19 pandemic restrictions and mobility issues can send their coordinates, that is, email ID and mobile number to OIA-II division at emails: us.oia2@mea.gov.in and so1oia2@mea.gov.in,” said the notice on the official website.Thereafter, affected students had urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene in the matter and facilitate the students’ return through an open letter. “Nothing much has come of it. We informed our university about the difficulties we have been facing while attending online classes. In response, we were asked to refer to study material online if we are not able to understand well during classes,” said a third-year student from Jianghan University in Wuhan. Students have been complaining that online classes and uncertainty over their return to campuses have led to mental stress. “Studying online for a prolonged time is exacting an immense mental toll on students. An increasing number of students are suffering from anxiety and stress due to uncertainty in the tentative date of return,” said students in an open letter issued earlier. Students of Chinese universities returned to India last year amid a raging pandemic as their universities imposed lockdowns. More than a year on, they have not been able to return to campuses as China continues to impose a travel ban for international students.Earlier this year, students pursuing their degrees in Chinese universities approached the United Nations (UN) hoping for positive development. In a letter signed by over 20,000 medical, graduate and undergraduate school students studying in universities in China, Japan and Australia, students have urged the UN to intervene in the matter and help lift border restrictions that have left thousands of students stranded in their home countries for the past one year.According to data from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), in 2018 and 2019, China received around 500,000 international students each, the third-highest in the world after the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK). Official data shows that in 2018, over 23,000 Indian students were enrolled in various programmes in China. Indians represent the fourth largest group of international students in China, after South Koreans, Thais and Pakistanis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/another-semester-online-for-medical-students-enrolled-in-chinese-varsities-101629915196152.html

The retired subedar surrendered to the police on Tuesday morning claiming to be solely responsible for the murders, but the police said that his wife was ‘equally involved’.The suspect, Rao Rai Singh Yadav (59), was in police detention after he surrendered and was formally arrested on Wednesday along with his wife, Bimlesh Yadav (55), after the two were questioned by the investigators. The couple was produced before the court on Wednesday, following which the man was sent on two-day police remand and the woman was given 14-day judicial custody.Deepak Saharan, the deputy commissioner of police who is investigating the case, said, “Bimlesh has said that she was with Yadav throughout when he attacked the victims. She did not use the weapon but stood by his side and instigated him.”According to the police, they killed their daughter-in-law suspecting her of having an extramarital affair with the tenant, Krishan Tiwari (45). Tiwari’s wife Anamika Tiwari, 35, and the couple’s nine-year-old daughter were also murdered on Tuesday. Their three-year-old daughter underwent treatment at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, and is out of danger. She was shifted to the general ward on Wednesday evening, the police said.After discussing the situation with his wife and son, Yadav surrendered at the Rajendra Park police station on Tuesday morning and took the blame to allegedly to shield his wife, the police said.The police said Yadav’s nine-year-old granddaughter is a prime witness in the case. They said the child is in shock after seeing her mother’s body lying in a pool of blood. The child got up around 2.15am upon hearing cries and tried to open the door but it was locked from the outside. Bimlesh entered the room and told her to sleep as some neighbours were unwell, the police said.Ashok Yadav, the brother of the daughter-in-law Sunita Yadav (40), said, “The girl told us that her grandparents killed her mother and they were bad people.”The girl was sent to a friend’s house in the neighbourhood on Tuesday, and handed over to her relatives on Wednesday evening, the police said.Saharan said the couple knocked on their daughter-in-law’s bedroom door around 2.10am, telling her that her daughter was suffering from eye pain and wanted to sleep alongside her mother. “As soon as she opened the door, Yadav attacked her more than 17 times with a sharp gardening tool, as suggested by the autopsy report, and she collapsed,” he said.“More arrests are likely in the case. We are investigating if the son also had any involvement in the case. The last call made by Yadav was to his son, Anand, who said he was in Rajasthan at the time of the incident,” said Saharan.Saharan said Anand was indeed in Rajasthan as corroborated by CCTV footage collected from a hotel he was staying in, and roadside eateries where he stopped on his way.Sujan Singh, Yadav’s counsel, said they (him and Anand) will meet Yadav in police custody on Thursday. Anand is a lawyer. “The court has permitted us to meet him for an hour to discuss the case and court proceedings,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/murder-spree-suspect-s-wife-arrested-for-planning-crime-101629914837553.html

She was a resident of Kanina in Mahendragarh, about 97 kilometres from Gurugram, and moved in with her in-laws at their Sector 105 residence after marriage.Ashok Yadav, Sunita’s brother, said following their father’s death in 1993, the property was transferred to him and Sunita. Ashok is a farmer who undertakes agricultural work on three acres, of which one acre belonged to Sunita.“The land is at a prime location on Kanina-Kosli main road and has a value of ₹1.5 crore. Her in-laws got to know about the property and started forcing her to sell it, but my sister wanted to keep this aside to support her daughter. Her daughter is a fan of badminton players Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu, and was taking badminton training at a sports academy. Sunita wanted to sell this land for her higher studies and her sports career,” he said.The family members alleged that Sunita’s in-laws constantly picked fights with her over household chores because she refused to sell the plot. “They used to humiliate and taunt us that we were using her plot to survive and meet our needs. Sunita often complained that her husband ill-treated her and in-laws assaulted her, but each time, we consoled her and told her things would get better,” Sharmila Devi, Sunita’s sister-in-law, said.The family said Sunita was assaulted a few years ago and a panchayat was also held in Kanina village over the issue.The police said Ashok is also being questioned and that more family members will be called in for questioning.Meanwhile, the three-year-old girl, the daughter of Yadav’s tenants who were also murdered, is recovering at Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital and is under heavy medication. Her family members said she was shifted to the general ward on Wednesday but she constantly escaped her bed to go look for her mother. She suffered seven grave injuries to her head, neck and chest, and minor injuries to her arms and fingers, they said.“She is missing her mother and is trying to look around for her. She is crying and asking us to call her mother. She can’t recall what happened and is under a lot of trauma. She was hit at least seven times while she was fast asleep,” Varendra Shukla, a relative of the tenant’s family and a neighbour, said.The bodies of the tenant, Krishan Tiwari, 45, his wife, Anamika Tiwari, 35, and the couple’s nine-year-old daughter were cremated in Gururgam, while Sunita’s family conducted her last rites in Mahendragarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/murder-spree-she-was-constantly-abused-by-her-in-laws-say-family-members-of-victim-101629914834149.html

Even as the state health department has set a target of 60,000, the district health department is aiming to cover a higher number of beneficiaries. “About 35,000 people have to be inoculated with the second dose of Covishield and 11,500 with Covaxin at government facilities. In private hospitals, almost 22,000 people have to be given the second jab of Covishield and at least 9,000 need to be given Covaxin,” Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said.The estimate is based on the number of people who were vaccinated with the first dose of the vaccines before June 3, which largely includes people in the 18-45 year age group. As per the target, of the 60,000 doses to be administered, nearly 60% will be given as the second dose and 40% as the first dose.On Wednesday, the health department opened about 15,000 online slots on the Co-WIN platform for the mega vaccination drive. Of these, at least 2,500 slots are for administering Covaxin and 12,500 for Covishield, at government health centres.

Health officials attribute the dip in cases to increased testing, monitoring and effective vaccination.According to the health department data, of 3,389 tests administered on Tuesday, only one positive case was detected on Wednesday. This took the test positivity rate, the proportion of positives out of the samples tested, to 0.02% in Gurugram, while the state has a positivity rate of 0.05% at present.The Covid-19 cases have been on a constant wave of peaks and troughs since May 2020, after reporting a relatively lower count of cases in March and April of 2020. In contrast, cases started spiking in April 2021, with around 100,000 of the total of 181,033 cases reported during the second wave. Currently, there are 71 active cases, of whom five are critically ill patients undergoing treatments at hospitals. The Covid-19 toll is currently at 922. “Daily cases are on a decline, but the health department is conducting an average of 3,750 tests per day, with nearly 80% of them Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Testing, monitoring and effective vaccination have led to a downfall in infection rate,” said Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram. As reported by HT on Monday, the weekly case count has been on a constant decline in the district, dropping from 51 cases in the first week of August to 39 cases over the past week. For more than a month, fewer than 10 new cases are detected every day.Data collated through the district health bulletin shows that from July 18 to 24, 52 cases were reported, after which 50 and 51 cases were reported from July 24-31 and August 1-7, respectively. Subsequently, the cases dropped to 36 from August 8-14 and increased marginally to 39 from August 15-21.Despite the downward trend of cases, the health department is preparing for a third wave that is predicted around October by the Central government. Private hospitals have been asked to form oxygen audit committees, whereas a team of doctors from the health department and Indian Medical Association (IMA) has been constituted to audit the bed availability in private hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/one-covid-19-case-reported-lowest-since-march-13-2020-101629914775185.html
25-08-2021||Gurugram||Work on final biodiversity registers starts after Covid-19 delays||A year and a half after an expert committee was formed by the Gurugram administration, work on developing the final people’s biodiversity registers (PBR) started on Monday, officials said. As part of the project, PBRs of 47 villages, 36 in Gurugram and 11 in Faridabad, falling in the Aravallis will be completed by October.PBRs are techno-legal documents that will serve as a repository of information on plants, animals, and crops, along with traditional knowledge of their place in local ecosystems. As per the Biological Diversity Act, 2002, every urban local body (ULB) in the country is mandated to prepare such a register for areas within their jurisdiction through biodiversity management committees (BMC).A total of 6,437 such BMCs have been formed across various urban local bodies in Haryana including, 203 in Gurugram. “In Haryana, BMCs were constituted around one-and-a-half years ago and primary PBRs were under preparation. Now, we have engaged technical support groups to help the BMCs. We have also constituted a state-level PBR quality monitoring committee and their members visited a few villages in Gurugram on Monday to assess whether the PBRs are being prepared properly or not,” said Vineet Kumar Garg, the chairman of Haryana State Biodiversity Board.The committee visited Tikli, Gairatpur Bas and Hasanpur villages in Gurugram district on Monday, while on Tuesday, the committee visited Mangar, Kot and Pali villages in Faridabad district.Sunil Harsana, a Faridabad-based wildlife researcher with expertise in the conservation of biodiversity, is working with the state biodiversity board for the formation of the final PBRs in Aravalli villages. A biologist, Samarth Khanna, an expert in identifying plants and wildlife of Aravallis, is also working alongside Harsana.“Until now, Haryana did not have a formal record of its local biodiversity and there is a lot still to be known about the Aravallis. These PBRs will help us maintain these records as traditional knowledge and will be registered in government records. Once it is known that a particular species of plant, crop or wildlife is found in a region, and it is documented, an interest can be generated among locals to save that species. Even if a commercial set-up is exploiting those resources, they would have to give compensation to the locals,” said Harsana.Last year, draft PBRs were formed but they were found to be lacking quality and rigour, officials said. The work also got delayed due to the lockdowns to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. PBRs rely on field inspections, as well as secondary data obtained from line departments of forest and wildlife, agriculture, fisheries, horticulture and animal husbandry departments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/work-on-final-biodiversity-registers-starts-after-covid-19-delays-101629914774209.html
25-08-2021||Other||This sketch artist is the police’s best friend||PUNE: On August 14, a case of child molestation was registered at the Dattawadi police station in which a hand-drawn sketch of a rickshaw driver helped the police identify him after the CCTV failed in the dark of the night. On August 18, he was arrested and sent to prison. A search for the person who had drawn the sketch landed us at the office of professor Girish Charwad, 46, of the Bharti Vidyapeeth College of Fine Arts, Katraj. Charwad recently finished teaching a course in sketching suspects to the maiden batch at the criminal investigation division (CID) of Maharashtra located in Pune.How did you start teaching at CID?Answer: I was checking the acoustics in a hall built at the police research centre on the request of a police friend. While I was there, the recently transferred ADG CID Atulchandra Kulkarni was also present and my friend told him about the kind of work I do. ADG Kulkarni took interest and worked on the idea of starting a course in sketching suspects at CID. Of the first batch of 20 people, 18 completed the course recently and the second batch has begun two or three days ago. The CID has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) for the certification.How did you start doing what you do?Answer: In 1997, when I was in college, my friends and I were helping the police draw the sketch of a suspect. There were no mobile phones at the time so whoever was found did the job. My sketch came closest to the suspect and from that time, I started doing this off and on whenever the police required but all under the radar until 2002. In 2022, there was a spurt in brutal kidnappings and my work increased. D N Jadhav was the commissioner of police and Chandrashekhar Dethankar was the deputy commissioner of police back then. My work was appreciated by the then commissioner of police in a crime meeting and introduced to all police stations (till then, it was limited to a few police stations). As officers kept moving out, word of mouth kept spreading. Now I get called to various parts of Maharashtra to sketch suspects.What are some of the memorable cases you have been involved in?Answer: I have sketched extensively for the kidnappings in the early 2000s. There was a case of a deaf and dumb girl who was gang-raped in Bhosari, and several high-profile cases including some explosions and murders which I cannot talk about. I had sketched Sandesh alias Sainath Abhang (convicted of the murder of woman, 66, and rape and attempted murder of her five months’ pregnant daughter-in-law). There was a case of a body being left under the backseat of a bus, and the kidnapping of a four-month-old baby in Chakan. There was a case of a man who molested minor girls by asking them for directions. I have also sketched suspects in cases of chain snatching, robbery and dacoity.Tell us about your qualifications.Answer: I have completed a diploma in applied art, art teacher diploma (ATD), and diploma in art education [VERIFYING THE NAMES OF THESE DIPLOMAS FROM THE COLLEGE] from Abhinav college. Then I went on to pursue my MA in fine arts at the Babasaheb Ambedkar University in Aurangabad. I had always wanted to pursue a doctorate in a nice subject related to music, musicians, or the sarod as I play it. But my body of work in sketching suspects had built up so well that I pursued my PhD in the contribution of art to crime investigation (in Marathi) from Rashtrasant Tukadoji Maharaj Nagpur University.What kind of tools do you use, modern and traditional?Answer: My work mostly involves drawing with hands. There are softwares that provide thousands of options for anatomical parts such as the lips, nose, eyebrows, chin, ears, eyes, etc. But the victims or witnesses are generally too shaken to choose between thousands of options. So, I use a simple pencil and paper. But with tools like tablet computers which provide for handmade sketches, we can choose drawings without hair, save them, and then proceed to draw the hair or facial hair etc. That would be a big step forward.What are the challenges you face?Answer: The dialogue with witnesses is the most difficult part mainly because of the sensitive state of mind that they are in. It was most difficult to communicate with the deaf and dumb girl who was gang-raped. Unfortunately, we had to make her mother ask her the questions in a manner that she understood. Asking little children about their abusers is another challenge. In cases where there are multiple accused, it is difficult to decipher whether the accused providing information is trying to mislead or not. If the crime has taken place at a particular time of the day, the sketch is best drawn at that time of the day and the location given the direction of light. At one time, I was playing the sarod at a concert and the police were waiting to take me for a sketch right afterwards. My fellow musicians had a lot of misconceptions when they saw two hawaldars escorting me hurriedly after the show. I had to explain to them that I had done nothing wrong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/this-sketch-artist-is-the-police-s-best-friend-101629914653451.html

The offline process started immediately after August 15. However we are getting poor response with our staff issuing about 10 to 12 passes on a daily basis. We have deputed 16 primary teachers across the two timing slots. Passes include monthly and regular passes.”After the chief minister allowed citizens who have completed vaccination against covid-19 (including 14 days after the second dose) to travel by local train from August 15, the process was facilitated both online and offline. However, as the online process would take more time, the offline process was started on a priority basis. Accordingly, the PMC set up two help desks – one at Pune and the other at Shivajinagar railway station – and started the offline process on August 17 itself. The help desks are operational all seven days of the week from 7am to 1pm and 1pm to 7pm.Sunil Indulkar, deputy municipal commissioner, said, “Till date, we have issued nearly 200 passes to railway passengers. The state government has started an online service to issue ‘universal travel passes’. However, we are providing offline passes to those who are not used to the online process.”While there are 42 local trains operating to- and fro- between Pune and Lonavala with around 70,000 to 80,000 commuters travelling daily under normal circumstances, there are presently only eight local trains from Pune to Lonavala and Lonavala to Pune, that too for emergency services, with only around 4,000 commuters travelling on a daily basis. A minimum 50% of these commuters are monthly pass holders.Harsha Shah, president, Railway Pravasi Group, said, “Due to limited local train services, the numbers of travellers is less as compared to normal situations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-gets-poor-passenger-response-for-offline-railway-passes-101629914596251.html

We have sought police cooperation for taking measurements at Fashion Street. The vendors did not wait for the fire safety norms to be put in place and went ahead with raising the structures which is illegal.”Earlier this month, Kumar wrote to the Lashkar police station seeking action against the alleged ongoing construction at Fashion Street. Last month, the PCB issued a public notice asking the vendors there to maintain “status quo” and refrain from carrying out any further construction. Kumar even requested the police to deploy adequate personnel on an urgent basis to maintain status quo until such time the board took a decision and to avoid any untoward incident and disruption of law and order. Despite the steps taken by the board however, further illegal construction was reported. Recently, the board received complaints about illegal structures having been raised without mandatory permissions.On March 26 this year, nearly 500 to 600 shops at Fashion Street were completely gutted after a major fire broke out in the area. While no casualties were reported, the head of the PCB’s fire department, Prakash Hasabe, was killed in a road accident while returning home after dousing the fire. Hasabe’s two-wheeler came under a bus the next morning at around 6.30am while he was on his way home (Viman nagar) after finishing fire-fighting at Fashion Street which was completely charred in the blaze.While the PCB is keen on construction of a commercial complex well equipped with all fire safety measures, the vendors’ association has publicly maintained that it is right in resuming business in accordance with vendors’ rights to a livelihood. Fashion Street, which is located adjacent to MG road, typically houses around 448 registered shops and 200 unauthorised outlets selling garments, shoes and other accessories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pcb-writes-to-police-commissioner-says-vendors-shops-at-fashion-street-illegal-101629914593459.html

Prasad is from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the largest constituent of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar.“The party has taken the MLA’s statement seriously and we will take action on it. An explanation has been sought from him,” JD(U) state unit president Umesh Kushwaha told reporters on Wednesday. Last week, Mandal alleged that Prasad frequently visited Bhagalpur to “collect extortion money” from shop owners and demanded a probe into the matter. He had also demanded deputy CM’s resignation.“’Deputy CM comes to Bhagalpur, not for development, but to collect extortion money. He hangs out with people who tried to defeat BJP and JD(U) in the recent assembly polls. He only hangs out with people having money,” Mandal had said while speaking to reporters at Bhagalpur on Saturday last.Prasad is also the minister in charge of Bhagalpur district.Mandal’s statement has infuriated BJP leaders. “JD (U) should take note of his statements and act,” BJP’s state unit president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal said. Mandal also called Samrat Chaudhary, who became Panchayati Raj minister from BJP quota and had demanded action against the MLA, a defector. “One who does not have the strength to contest the elections, what will he say,” said Mandal.

25-08-2021||Patna||Patna HC struggles with fewer judges, piling cases||The Patna high court, which has a sanctioned strength of 53 judges, will be left with just 18 by September end if new judges are not appointed by then in the 105-year-old institution, according to data accessed by HT.The current strength of judges at the HC is 19 and one of them is due to retire by next month’s end.This year, according to senior officials in the court, the Patna HC collegium has sent four recommendations comprising a total of 35 names to reduce the vacancies, but appointments are still awaited. These names have been recommended during the tenure of incumbent Chief Justice Sanjay Karol, who was the last appointment to the Patna HC, in November 2019. The last three recommendations comprising 20 names were made since July 16, including one on August 2. The number of vacancies, which stood at 24 in August 2019, when Justice AP Shahi was the Chief Justice, is set to rise to 35, including the one falling vacant in September 2021.In August 2019 also, Justice Shahi had recommended 24 names, including 15 from the bar and nine from the service, but all were remitted back by the law department vide its letter dated September 3, 2020, said an official.Thereafter, incumbent Chief Justice Sanjay Karol sent the first recommendation comprising four names on January 15, 2021, and followed it up with another recommendation with 11 more names on February 11, 2021.Later, the HC collegium recommended eight names from the bar with representation to all communities. This, according to an official, included names of three from other backward castes (OBC), one each from scheduled caste (SC), a Muslim and a woman, and three from general category, to give it a more balanced look.“Earlier, the names recommended by the HC collegium and forwarded by the Centre were almost accepted, but the final warrant of appointment is issued by the President only after a go-ahead from the ministry of law and justice. In view of falling strength of judges in Patna HC, we are hopeful new names will soon be cleared,” the official quoted above said.The issue of rising vacancies was also raised during the closing function of centenary year celebrations of the Patna HC in 2016 before Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was the chief guest, by the then Chief Justice of India TS Thakur. The Patna HC then had 14 vacancies, while Thakur had pointed out that 468 of around 900 posts of HC judges were vacant across the country at that point of time.Senior advocate Vinod Kanth said the delay was sad, as it was only contributing to big pendency of cases in an already overburdened judiciary.In July this year, Yogesh Chandra Verma, president of the coordination committee of the three associations of lawyers, had said there were 69,109 writ petitions pending for disposal. The total number of pending cases in the High Court is estimated to be around 2.13 lakh, up from 1.78 lakh in December 2020. In fact, in view of growing pendency and fresh filing of cases, the bench of Justice Chakradhari Sharan Singh had asked the chief secretary what the government was doing to prevent filing of frivolous cases.“The process (of appointment of judges) needs to be made smoother to avoid delays, which affect justice system. At present, a three-judge collegium of the HC sends its recommendations to the SC, where another three-judge collegium either accepts the names or rejects. The names accepted by SC collegium are then forwarded to the ministry of law and justice. If the ministry approves, it is sent to the President for warrant, else it is returned to the SC. If the SC collegium reiterates it, the ministry has to accept it, but it can be delayed,” Kanth said.Former advocate general and senior advocate PK Shahi said Bihar never had such poor strength of judges as far as he could remember. “The strength has now perhaps fallen lower than even Jharkhand, resulting in huge pendency and delay in disposal of cases. Even for bail matters, one has to wait for 8-10 months. The litigants are suffering. Even hearing of writ petitions is getting delayed. We cannot comment on why the recommendations are being rejected or delayed, but it has certainly affected delivery of justice,” he said.According to Supreme Court website, of the total 1,098 judges posts in high courts in the country, 455 are vacant as on August 1, 2021. Apart from Patna high court, there are large number of positions vacant in high courts of Andhra Pradesh, Calcutta, Madhya Pradesh, Allahabad, Punjab and Haryana and Rajasthan, according to the data on SC website. Former additional solicitor general (ASG) SD sanjay said, “Even urgent cases and those related to development issues are suffering. Now, the HC collegium has also started taking a balanced view by accommodating all sections, as happened in case of the last recommendation. Hopefully, the SC will now start clearing the names, as delay is hurting the cause of justice delivery.”Head: Court concernsIntro: HC collegium has sent 35 names this year to reduce the vacancies, but appointments are still awaited Judges’ strengthSanctioned: 53Current: 19Vacancies: 35 (one anticipated in Sept)Pending casesCurrent: 2.13 lakhDec 2020: 1.78 lakh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/patna-hc-struggles-with-fewer-judges-piling-cases-101629909073608.html

The state cabinet has given its nod to the Jharkhand Municipal (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which would be tabled for approval in the upcoming monsoon session of the Jharkhand assembly next week. “The decision of the state government is in the interest of people. These are local body polls and conducting it on a non-party basis would end the unusual influence of the political parties and help local aspirations,” said JMM spokesperson Manoj Pandey. After the amendments, willing candidates would be able to contest the post of mayor in the municipal corporations and chairman of municipalities without a party symbol. The amendment in the municipal Act will also give rights to the state government to cancel the appointment of municipal heads if they do not attend three consecutive meetings of the house, sources said. There are 34 urban local bodies in the state and the last election was held in 2018 on party basis after the then Raghubar Das government had amended the municipal Act and introduced election with party symbols for the post of heads of the municipal corporations and other municipalities. The BJP had then won in 20 of the 34 local bodies. While the move has been hailed by the ruling JMM, the opposition BJP has opposed the move. BJP legislature party leader Babulal Marandi said the state government should review its decision. The BJP said the move would give an advantage to money bags with muscle power. “The population of a corporation like Ranchi would be around 15 lakh. It will not be possible for a common person to reach out to the electorate on their own. This would provide an advantage to people with money and muscle power. The government needs to review its decision,” said Marandi. BJP spokesperson Pratul Shabdeo also charged that the state government was bringing this legislation as it wants to prevent the fallout of its impending loss in the municipal polls. “They know people would punish them due to their failure in governance in the past two years. So they don’t want to be seen being defeated. But people understand all these tactics,” added Shahdeo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jkhand-cabinet-no-more-party-wise-polls-for-post-of-mayor-municipality-chairman-bjp-opposes-move-101629908954686.html

He said the four people involved in the attack were arrested on July 2 and revealed that the attack was planned with the consent of Tabrez.On July 2, the Rae Bareli police stated that Tabrez had sold off his 18 biswa land in February this year. It was his parental property and his other relatives also had a share in it. Tabrez’s relatives were raising objection on the issue and demanding their share, after which he allegedly hired shooters to stage the attack on his SUV with the intent of framing his relatives, said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/munawwar-rana-s-son-held-for-staging-attack-on-himself-to-frame-others-101629904033256.html

25-08-2021||Lucknow||UP govt says no space for 'Taliban' mentality on posters condemning AMU VC for condoling Kalyan Singh's demise||The Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday warned that individuals who display “Talibani” thinking or ideology would face strict action. The warning was a reaction to posters springing across the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) campus condemning the vice-chancellor Tariq Mansoor for condoling the death of former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh. The government said it is probing the matter.The poster which condemned the vice-chancellor were shared by ‘Students of Aligarh Muslim University’, according to a report by news agency PTI. The posters shared the message - Praying for a criminal is an unforgiving crime - an apparent reference to the felling of the Babri Masjid, during which Kalyan Singh was the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. Singh was acquitted along with former Union minister Lal Krishna Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi in September 2020.“The condolence words of the AMU VC on the demise of ex-chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Kalyan Singh are not only a matter of shame but also hurt the religious sentiments of our community,” the poster said.The poster makers also said that the condolence message brought ‘disgrace’ to the entire AMU fraternity and the “Aligarh Movement”. The poster makers called the act of condoling the former chief minister’s death ‘shameful’. “Kalyan Singh is not only the main culprit in the demolition of Babri Masjid but also an offender for not obeying the Supreme Court's order. The VC's condolence has brought disgrace to the entire AMU fraternity,” the poster said.UP minister Mohsin Raza said that the vice-chancellor’s condolence message was reflective of ‘Indian culture’ and the posters were an attempt to vitiate the atmosphere in the university. “If some persons of Talibani soch (mentality) are there we will treat them accordingly. This is a university of Hindustan. There is no Taliban here. This is an attempt to vitiate the atmosphere,” Raza, the minority affairs minister of the state was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. He said strict action would be taken in order to set an example for others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/amu-posters-condemning-v-c-up-govt-says-no-space-for-taliban-mentality-101629899931040.html

In a press conference held here, Rathore said the Adani Agri Fresh Company had reduced the procurement rate of apples by ₹16, thus negatively impacting the ₹5,000-crore apple market of the state. “Covid-19 and unseasonal rain and snow in May have caused immense losses to small farmers. And now, the prices of the fruits have also nosedived. Congress will not remain a mute spectator to this loot of farmers,” said Rathore, adding that the party will launch a stir. Rathore further alleged that the government was hand-in-glove with apple traders and commission agents. He said apple prices were deliberately brought down so that corporate companies can accumulate profits. “Corporate companies of Ambani and Adani are getting full protection from the government in the loot of farmers,” he alleged. Rathore said the new farm laws enacted by the Centre were to benefit their capitalist friends. “Does Himachal Pradesh government also want the farmers of the state to end their lives?” he asked. He said the input cost of a box of apple comes to around ₹450 to ₹500 but farmers are barely able to make ₹600 for a box this year. The HPCC chief said, “Since 1984, the government has been giving subsidies on insecticides, fungicides and other input material, along with agricultural equipments. However, the present BJP dispensation has withdrawn all these benefits.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/save-apple-farmers-from-open-loot-by-corporates-himachal-congress-chief-101629897192613.html

The train packed with luxurious, see-through vistadome coaches would not only give a comfortable ride to passengers but also boost eco tourism in the state. The coaches have reached the Mailani junction in Lakhimpur Kheri district, said North Eastern Railway (NER) officials. “As of now, we have received a set of two vistadome coaches brought from the Mhow Coaching Depot. These are stationed at the Mailani Junction. The special coaches are meant to ply on the Mailani-Nanpara route via Dudhwa Forest Reserve,” said Pankaj Kumar Singh, chief public relations officer (CPRO), NER. However, NER officials are yet to finalise the time-table and fare of the train. “Officially it is yet to be decided when the train would hit the track. But it is expected to roll out on World Tourism Day (September 27, 2021),” said a senior official. Once started, passengers could enjoy the lush green scenic view of Dudhwa National Park from the ultra-modern vistadome coaches. “Initially, the train would be equipped with two vistadome coaches, each having a seating capacity of 60 passengers,” another NER official said highlighting the features of the state-of the art coaches.

As of now, the court has 19 judges while the sanctioned strength is 53. By September end, the Patna high court will be left with 18 judges, with one more due to retire, if appointments are not made until then.In August 2019, then chief Justice AP Shai recommended 24 names, including 15 from the bar but no appointments were made. Shai’s successor, Sanjay Karol, sent his first recommendation of four names on January 15 this year. He recommended 11 more names on February 11. Later, eight more names from the bar were recommended.The number of pending cases in the high court is estimated to be around 21,30,00 up from 17,80,00 in December 2020.Also Read | Bihar announces guidelines for Unlock 6: All you need to knowSenior advocate PK Shahi said the vacancies have resulted in huge pendency and delay in the disposal of cases. “Even for bail matters, one has to wait for 8-10 months. The litigants are suffering. Even hearing of writ petitions is getting delayed. We cannot comment on why the recommendations are being rejected or delayed, but it has certainly affected the delivery of justice.”Former additional solicitor general SD Sanjay said even urgent cases and those related to development issues are suffering. “...the delay in filling the vacancies is hurting the main cause of justice delivery.”The Supreme Court in April prescribed a judicially mandated timeline for the Centre to make appointments of judges in the high courts, saying promptness in this process was to facilitate the larger cause of dispensation of timely justice.The court, for the first time, indicated an outer time limit within which the Centre is expected to process the names for appointments of the high court judges, besides notifying appointments once the names are reiterated by its collegium. The existing Memorandum of Procedure, which guides judicial appointments, has not suggested any period within which the Centre is supposed to forward the recommendations to the Supreme Court collegium. The top court set down 18 weeks to complete this process. It added high courts have a shortage of around 40% judges, requiring a “collaborative” exercise involving the judiciary and the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/35-names-suggested-this-year-for-patna-high-court-judges-none-appointed-101629894254360.html

They were concerned about our chances of victory in the state elections next year but clarified that they are not against anyone. They want to go to the polls with a clear roadmap so that we win,” Rawat was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Rawat, however, said that it is concerning if a lawmaker feels ‘insecure’ and feels that the administration is ‘working against them’ or ‘wants them to lose’.

People aware of the developments said the vehicle has been bought to ensure comfortable travel, mainly for the purpose of mustering support for the Bharatiya Janata Party’s return to power in the next assembly elections, slated for 2023, in the state.“After stepping down (as chief minister), he (Yediyurappa) has returned all the official cars and will now use this which is more comfortable,” said one person aware of the developments, requesting not to be named.Yediyurappa spent about a week in Maldives and returned to Bengaluru on Sunday. On July 26, before he resigned as Karnataka CM, he vowed to work to bring the BJP back to power in the state. Two days later he was replaced by Basavaraj Bommai on July 28. He had also thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and BJP president JP Nadda for letting him continue in the top post despite his age (78) crossing BJP’s threshold for holding public positions.The person cited above added that earlier the 78-year-old had the option of travelling by a helicopter to distant places in a short span of time but after his stepping down, he has to depend on by-road travel for his engagements.Other former chief ministers’ association with luxury cars, too, has resulted in controversies in Karnataka in the past.Yediyurappa had to return a Toyota Landcruiser gifted to him by minister and industrialist Murugesh Nirani when the former was the state BJP president in 2016. It was meant for Yediyurappa to travel to drought-hit districts in the state. His critics had then hit out alleging there was dissonance in the luxurious nature of the vehicle and the tragedy engulfing poor people in the state.“Don’t compare it (the cost of the vehicle) with drought,” Yeddyurappa said at the time (April 16, 2016), as reported by the Press Trust of India.The Vellfire, purchased now, has an ultra luxurious interior with especially designed recliner seats that are considered very comfortable for long journeys.Yediyurappa’s predecessors like HD Kumaraswamy and Siddaramaiah too have courted controversies by travelling in high-end cars during their term in office.Kumaraswamy’s Range Rover was his vehicle of choice while he was the chief minister.Siddaramaiah was “given” a Toyota Landcruiser by his cabinet colleague KJ George first and later another Mercedes SUV by Congress leader Byrathi Suresh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/yediyurappa-to-ride-in-comfort-across-state-in-toyota-vellfire-101629892931621.html
25-08-2021||Chandigarh||Return of the native: Our Gulab’s journey home||Life is full of surprises. It was quite early that day when a phone ring abruptly broke the silence of the calm morning. “Gulab! It’s you!” my husband said unbelievably. Gulab! It was March 1999 when two of our acquaintances in Patiala arrived with a boy in his early teens. Everything in his life seemed great – until that one terrible day when his world turned upside down. At a tender age, cheated by a man from his own village with a false promise, he landed up in Patiala where he was sold to a family. He was maltreated and starved by his master. Alien to the culture and with no memory of his hometown, he was left with no choice but to stay there for three years. The people who brought him to us helped him get rid of that place. He pleaded them to get him employed far from Patiala. That’s how we met Gulab. He agreed to stay with us and was welcomed warmly in the family. We tried to convince him to get admission in a school, but he refused as he hadn’t even got his primary education. He started accompanying my father-in-law to look after our ancestral property. As the years went by, he mingled well with our family. Our house address became familiar with the name of Gulab. My kids affectionately called him Gulab Chacha. Though he looked happy, he always seemed perturbed over his past. One day, he opened up about some faded memories. His vague recollections of an animal fair held annually near his hometown and some landmarks were helpful during our online search. It took us a few days and voila! There it was, Balbal mela. He was sure his village was near it. Later, we came to know he belonged to Tilaiya village. His joy knew no bounds. A reservation for the train from Jalandhar to Patna was made. Finally, the day to say goodbye came. We all bid him farewell with a heavy heart. He reached Patna safely and took a bus for Hazaribagh. As it was getting dark, he got confused to follow the right track leading to his village from Hazaribagh. We told him to take shelter in a nearby hotel. The next day as the bus neared, several questions arose in his mind: Would his family still be there? Would they recognise him? He began to walk, following the dusty path etched in his brain from his childhood. His memory was guiding him home. Accompanied by a villager, he quickly recognised his house. He burst into tears on catching a glimpse of his mother. He told his family who he was. Dumbfounded, they asked him to show a particular scar on his body. He complied. Their happiness knew no bounds. Their son was back. For all these years, his parents had searched for him and lost hope. A reunion with their long-lost son was the last thing they expected. Gulab, too, was elated. Since all his younger siblings had been married, a suitable match was found for him, too. He returned to Punjab after getting engaged to Geeta Devi and stayed with us for three months. Sadly, after his wedding, there was no communication from his side. This phone call came as a big surprise because we had lost hope of ever reconnecting with him. He is now blessed with a baby girl, Kiran Kumari, and a baby boy, Kamlesh. amarbirkaur0@gmail.com The writer is a Hoshiarpur-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/return-of-the-native-our-gulab-s-journey-home-101629891971582.html

The former union minister alleged that the Central government wants to give the country’s assets, be it ports, railways, airports or big institutions, to its acquaintances at throwaway prices.Addressing reporters in Dausa, he said, “The government should help the poor and middle-class people instead of handing over the assets of the country to select people.” Also Read | No Bombay HC relief for Narayan RaneHe accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of misleading people and doing divisive politics. “Today, unemployment and inflation are skyrocketing.

Petrol prices are above ₹105 per litre, one gas cylinder is for ₹900, there are no jobs, lakhs of people died due to coronavirus disease, there was oxygen shortage during the second wave of the pandemic, still they are seeking blessings,” he said. BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said all charges made by the Congress leader are baseless. “Ever since the BJP government was formed in the Centre, rightful money of the poor is reaching their bank accounts. The government’s other schemes are working on the principle of sabka saath sabka vishvas,” he said. He said the Jan Ashirwad Yatra is being taken out to ensure that welfare schemes reach the masses. Pilot, during his Dausa visit, also exuded confidence that the Congress will win the zila parishad and panchayat samiti elections. The elections will be held in Bharatpur, Dausa, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Sawai Madhopur and Sirohi districts. Polling will be held in three phases on August 26, 29 and September 1, and counting of votes will take place on September 4 at the district headquarters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/centre-giving-away-assets-to-its-acquaintances-at-throwaway-prices-sachin-pilot-101629890531381.html

Face masks and PPE suits were burnt earlier. Now this new recycling system will allow plastic products to be made from the bio-medical waste.Small particles of plastic are made after a recycling process and then converted into various products.“In this pandemic all health workers and hospital staffers use PPE kits for protections and face masks. When the pandemic was at its peak our country was producing almost 200 tonnes per day of this waste. It was thrown away and eventually burnt. So we decided to reuse and recycle it. So we got five companies together for this project. The idea is ours but these companies will actually implement it,” said Dr Ashish Lele, director, NCL.“These companies are doing a pilot project in Pune where 150kg of this biomedical waste will be recycled and turned into products. There is only one company in Pune which collects biomedical waste from hospitals, swab centres, vaccination centres, and airports. Right now we are only taking face masks and PPE suits. First we got authorisation from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB),” said Dr Lele.“There is process called ‘autoclaving’ which is to sanitise these used masks and suits. It is basically to heat to a certain temperature in the presence of steam and then all viruses are inactivated,” he added.“Then we bring all this waste and keep it for some more days in quarantine and then we take it to recycling, where it is first shredded and then converted into small particles. That becomes the product and from that multiple plastic products are made. We are working with a company which uses this product to convert it into a automotive car, then also other things like computer parts and household items,” said Dr Lele.NCL hired research students to work on this project, and the waste management company gave the PPE kits.NCL will take the technology all over the country once the Pune operation is established.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ncl-in-pune-develops-tech-to-convert-biomedical-waste-to-plastic-101629888731241.html
25-08-2021||Other||Sutradhara’s Tales: How the Ambil Odha has made way for Pune’s devp for 100s of years||Torrential rain on September 25, 2019, played havoc with southern Pune, as a humble old stream called the “Ambil”, swelled to engulf everything in its way. The water and the silt entered ever-growing encroachments in the form of built apartments, cemented stream banks and slums, resulting in a terrible loss of property and life. In the rapidly expanding city of Pune, natural resources are the ones that are at stake. A constant battle between demand for urban spaces and the need of conservation brings out an age-old debate about disasters and sustainable development. In the times of the Peshwas it was no different. But, visionary Peshwa Balaji Bajirao alias Nanasaheb came up with a well worked out solution and utilised the fresh water streams not only for water supply, but for creating aesthetical beauty and to prevent floods. Amongst the most important freshwater steams that flow through the city of Pune, are the Nagjhari stream and the Ambil Odha. The locus of development of Pune is nestled in the space between these two streams in the form of an elevated mount, since the beginning of the settlement.Like most cities of Mawal, Pune has primarily settled on the banks of the rivers Mula and Mutha. Pune is surrounding by secondary offshoots of the Sahyadri, thus forming a saucer-shaped basin, open on the eastern side. The southern hills of Katraj stand as natural sentinels and give birth to numerous rivulets and streams that flow northwards to meet the river Mutha. In addition to the rivers, in absence of any other water source, large streams such as Ambil odha have served as an important water source for centuries. One can trace four distinct stages in the life of the Ambil odha, where changes were made at each stage by the then administrators as a response to the city’s development. The original unrestricted course of the Ambil started on the hill tops of the Katraj and came down roughly via present Satara road, and then along the present Bajirao road, to meet the Mutha river near the present day Amruteshwar temple complex.Based on microliths and other stone tools found in the area around “9 Sadashiv” in Sadashiv peth, Dr Rajguru and his team reported the presence of prehistoric man along channel of the stream meeting the river Mutha. The archaeological explorations have revealed microlithic tools nearby a seasonal stream flowing through heartland of Pune. Living on the bank of the stream as against frequent flooding of the river banks was preferred by prehistoric man who settled at this location in the early days. The Ambil stream had no name till then. Ambil literally means “sour” and it may be possible that the name referred to the somewhat sour taste of stream water. Confluences of sea, river or streams have always been assigned sanctity and were revered in the form of tirthas in Indian culture. A number of shrines, temples and memorials are known to be raised on confluences all across the Indian sub-continent. The few remnants of Narayaneshwar temple, a Yadava period religious complex in Pune were located at the original confluence of Ambil stream and the river Mutha. It is the presently occupied by the Thorla Shaikh Salla Dargah.When Shivaji Maharaj arrived at Pune in 1637, the banks of the Ambil stream were occupied by small hutments of fishermen folk, which formed the outskirts of the then Kasbe Pune. It was this very steam which has presented us with Pune’s two village deities, namely, Kasba Ganpati and goddess Tambdi Jogeshwari. A person from the Thakaar family found the “swayambhu” idol of Ganesha which was established in the form of a temple in Kasba peth. Similarly, the Tambdi Jogeshwari shrine has been located in area called “Kale vivar” that meanders along the same Ambil stream.The historical record mentions another offshoot of the Ambil stream flowing nearby Kedareshwar temple, adjacent to the Kasba Ganpati temple which might have flowed separately into the river Mutha. The earliest dam “Bel dharan”, was built in a C shape by Dadoji Konddeo at the base of hill which housed the Parvati religious complex, much later. The dam was primarily for irrigation purposes and it submerged a large area extending from Sanas ground to present day Parvati water works. The Pan Mala and Ganesh Mala were the cultivated areas for vegetables that benefited from the dam water. The remnants of the dam wall can still be seen over the Ambil Odha today.By the seventeenth century, the religious complexes of the town were firmly settled on both the banks of Ambil stream as it ran through the settlement. It also served as a water ditch for protection from the western side.As the historians of Pune chronicle “Pune Nagar Samshodhan Vrutta” note, Ambil Odha initially flowed through the old and new settlement of medieval Pune. When Bajirao I shifted to Shaniwarwada, Ambil Odha flowed from west side of Bhau Maharaj Bol near Jilbya Maruti and later ,along Tambdi Jogeshwari temple to Amruteshwar temple to meet the river. Income from taxes of Shaniwar peth was gifted by Bajirao I to his younger sister Bhiubai in dowry. Her brother-in-law, Babuji Naik, commissioned the Amruteshwar temple and Shri Siddheshwar temples in her memory at the location where the Ambil stream meets the river.The area beyond present day Lakshmi road was end of Pune’s settlement and the area around Shanipar on the banks of Ambil stream served as a cremation ground for a while.Nanasaheb Peshwa, however, had other ideas. He was keen on the expansion of Pune’s settlement to the west and planned a diversion for the Ambil Odha. An unfortunate tragedy which took place in 1752, making him take this daring decision.Peshwa had initiated a religious charity or “Dakshina” for learned Brahmins all over the kingdom who would come to Pune to seek patronage. The original venue for Dakshina was at Kabutarkhana near Onkareshwar temple. As the legend goes, 40,000 Brahmins, chiefly from Telangana area had stayed at Kabutarkhana on that particular occasion and were locked in due to heavy rains. Around 40-50 Brahmins were engulfed by the flooding of the Ambil Odha and lost their lives. This accident compelled Nanasaheb Peshwa to immediately undertake construction of an alternate space for carrying out religious charities and planned a diversion for the Ambil stream. Thus, he commissioned a lake with dam on the Ambil stream and diverted the flow of stream at a sharp right angle towards the west, the present day Dattawadi, and connected it to the river. The diversion created access and caused a huge amount of land to open up for new settlement; thus, kick starting city’s expansion.Though Nanasaheb diverted the Ambil odha he made sure sufficient space was kept to accommodate the annual flooding of the stream, allowing it to breath. However, the last change and latest events witnessed by the Ambil stream in the form of incessant and illegal encroachments has choked it and has led to the unfathomable disaster we witnessed on September 25, 2019. In this light, one sincerely wishes that Nanasaheb Peshwa’s vision guided the city’s present-day builders to plan for better development of Pune in 21st century.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sutradharas-tales-how-the-ambil-odha-has-made-way-for-pune-s-devp-for-100s-of-years-101629888131180.html
25-08-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena defends Narayan Rane’s arrest||Maharashtra’s ruling Shiv Sena has defended Narayan Rane’s arrest over his remarks about slapping chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, saying the union minister crossed all limits. In an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana, it slammed Rane and called his remarks an insult to Maharashtra.“Anyone who speaks against (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi is charged with anti-national activity and is sent to jail. Rane’s crime is of similar fashion. Maharashtra is a law-abiding state, and it was necessary to send a strong message that we will not tolerate beyond a limit. Even Modi will not tolerate such arrogance.”The editorial said anyone who talks about “manhandling the chief minister” will have to face the music according to the law of the land. “A few intellectuals who were accused of conspiring against Modi are still languishing in jail due to the action taken by the previous Devendra Fadnavis government,” said the editorial. It said any decent politician would have apologised for such remarks. The editorial added both Rane and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) do not care about Maharashtra’s pride.Also Read | Video showing minister ordering for Rane’s arrest goes viral, BJP seeks actionRane on Monday criticised Thackeray for allegedly confusing the number of years since India got independence during the chief minister’s August 15 address. “It is shameful that the chief minister does not know the year of independence. He leaned back to enquire [with his chief secretary] about the count of years of independence during his speech. Had I been there, I would have given him a slap under his ears?” Rane said. His comments sparked outrage and he was arrested a day later and subsequently released on bail.The editorial called Rane’s comments an insult to both the state as well as the citizens as Thackeray is the head of Maharashtra. It called Rane a back-stabber, who was disloyal to Shiv Sena, which made him the chief minister. “Rane is nothing without the Sena. We have defeated him four times after he left the Sena,” said the editorial. It added the BJP has “unleashed Rane” just to trouble the Sena after losing power in the state. “Rane will be a big embarrassment to the BJP and serve no useful purpose.”The BJP asked Shiv Sena to introspect. “Uddhav Thackeray has been constantly criticising Modi. The Sena has a record of using derogatory language and has no moral right to criticise anyone,” said BJP lawmaker Ram Kadam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-defends-narayan-rane-s-arrest-101629886390791.html
25-08-2021||Chandigarh||Bureaucratic resilience necessary but not enough for governance||Good governance comes from experience but a lot of that comes from bad governance.Governments often blame bureaucracy for wrongs attributed to them. It may be correct to evade accountability but not always true. The core function of any government is to deliver transparent and responsive governance that cares for the poor and vulnerable. It should be rule-based and maintain constitutional proprieties in all spheres of life, social, political, and economic. Conflicts in governance emerge when its various actors become self-interested and competitive. Also read: Amarinder to lead Cong’s Punjab Assembly battle: Rawat as fresh trouble brewsThe bureaucratic predominance in governance has existed since time immemorial. Max Weber theorised bureaucratic essentiality in governance. However, many of us believe that good governance is primarily the function of civil servants. Undoubtedly, civil servants represent the permanent establishment and are referred to as the steel frame of the government, but they are not flawless. They may be relatively more resilient owing to their education, information, and even better intellectual understanding, but academic and intellectual excellence, though necessary, is not enough for quality governance. Apart from being distant from ground realities, they do tend to be non-transparent and unresponsive. Many purposely violate rules, and some of them also abdicate their responsibilities and perform poorly for personal gains to which they are not entitled. Many a time, such conduct of bureaucrats allures political executives to governance that is not fully compliant with the law. Intellectual excellence is not the same as academic excellence. Many of those who had first-rate degrees have proved unworthy of their positions and who had no, or lesser education have risen to the topmost positions with more intellectual and emotional stability. Governments have to respond to rising aspirations, and that requires not only a good understanding of systems, laws, and processes but also a better appreciation of people’s perceptions and needs. Good intellectual minds leading to misuse of systems or social isolation based on caste or class differentiation do not yield unflawed governance that is widely applauded. Roles and responsibilities The roles and responsibilities of political executives and civil servants are well defined, though at times there is a thin line distinction. Politicians control the policy domain. Through legislatures, they make the laws and rules, which articulate the functional framework for the civil servants. They also set the goals for the civil servants. The political executives, if so required, can alter the rules based on political ideologies, programmes, or other socio-economic considerations but do not have the choice to allow or put up with their violations. The spoils system promoted for the benefit of a select few is a blatant attempt to squeeze the governance for personal or political dividends that are otherwise not permitted. Usurping the space allocated to the bureaucracy disturbs the balance of power and harms governance. However, the civil servants should concede the space legitimately provided to the political executives, of course without allowing their actions and interventions to become impermissible interference. The politicians, when in power, bring politics into government, but all of them are not familiar with the finer nuances of governance. Many are experienced, some learn core governance rather quickly, but several aspirational politicians get carried away by not so appreciable past bureaucratic or political practices. The bureaucracy is more adept in such practices using generous phrases such as natural justice, public interest or purposes, concern for national or internal security, etc., to cajole these not-so-experienced politicians in the governments for actions that are not strictly legitimate. Ground realities and governance In a democratic setup, elected representatives are more aware of the ground realities of life and are thus in a better position to guide the civil servants in framing public policies. Such policies should necessarily be evidence-based, and impartial to benefit everyone without any discrimination. However, the bureaucracy examines the real-life evidence that the politicians bring to the government, and often outcomes don’t turn out to be as visualised by the public due to inadequate appreciation of grassroots realities. Over the years, senior bureaucrats gain knowledge and information to fill in such a gap, but that is also becoming increasingly scarce. With lesser experiential learning and knowledge of affected areas or communities, the bureaucracy either circumvents the politicians or envelopes the governance in red tape. As an outcome, affirmative politics and good governance suffer. Even though intellectually and academically more resilient, the bureaucrats, being distant from battlegrounds, are observed to be less pragmatic and risk averse. Some of them concede to governance based on emotions, religions, casteism, and communism, which should be avoided for any principled decision-making. Some even become victims or partners in perilous politics. If intellectually strong and emotionally stable, civil servants and politicians ponder more on the ethical conduct of government business, fully reflecting upon the socio-economic needs of the common man, this may lay the foundation of political success through good governance. Trust and expectations Governance is thus not always driven by intellectual resilience; it requires grassroots understanding and a realistic appreciation of peoples’ aspirations, devoid of any bias. Discrimination based on caste, class, resource endowments, or even elite education should be prevented to ensure governance based on greater equality, equity, and rule-of-law. It should aim to “level up for all” and everyone should have equal opportunities to enjoy life through hard work and honest means. However, politics in our country is struggling to respond to these aspirations of younger generations. For the governments, the challenges are increasing with the commonly experienced decline in the popular trust in traditional politicians and the rising expectations from the bureaucracy. Unless remedied speedily, this may cause long-term damage to our democratic polity. sureshkumarnangia@gmail.comThe writer is chief principal secretary to Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh.

Maderna, who was out on interim bail on health grounds, had moved a fresh application for permanent bail.Maderna and former lawmaker Malkhan Singh Bishnoi are the prime accused in the abduction and murder of Devi, 36, in 2011. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which probed the case, has charged 17 people, including the Congress leaders, some of their family members, and paid assassins with the murder.Also Read | 13-yr-old girl saves three kids, drowns while rescuing 4th in RajasthanAccording to the CBI’s charge sheet in the case, Devi, a nurse, disappeared in September 2011 after a CD surfaced that showed Maderna with her amid reports that she was blackmailing him. Maderna was arrested in 2012 along with Bishnoi, who allegedly had a relationship with Devi before he introduced her to Maderna.The CBI has alleged the two plotted together to get rid of Devi after they were fed up with meeting her demands.

The court had granted Kundra interim protection from arrest on August 18.A single bench of Justice SK Shinde had also directed police to respond to the pre-arrest bail plea filed by Bollywood actor Shilpa Shetty’s husband.Kundra, who was arrested in July, is currently lodged in prison in another case pertaining to the production and distribution of pornographic materials through mobile apps.The businessman had moved the high court for anticipatory bail in early August after a sessions court had rejected his plea. Kundra had said another accused in the case had been granted bail and, hence, a similar ruling should be followed in his case.Additional Public Prosecutor Prajakta Shinde had opposed Kundra’s bail plea on the ground that Kundra’s role in the case was different from the other accused who was currently out on bail. Shinde had also asked the court for more time to take instructions on the application. The court granted her more time and gave Kundra interim protection for a week.This particular case was filed by the Mumbai cyber police in 2020 in which directors and owners of various over-the-top (OTT) platforms and websites were booked for broadcasting obscene content.The First Information Report was registered by a retired customs officer who had named several OTT platforms in his complaint. Police had also recorded model-actor Sherlyn Chopra’s statement in this matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/porn-racket-case-bombay-high-court-to-hear-raj-kundra-s-bail-plea-today-101629863916728.html

The aforementioned amount does not include another ₹650 crore that the government is looking to earn from excise duty, import fees, value-added tax, and other licence fees, the official said, adding that another ₹900 to ₹1,000 crore is expected to come from the licensing of new brands, distributor licenses, and the like.The 12 zones to be put up for auction include localities such as Sarita Vihar, Shakarpur, Dakshinpuri, Anand Vihar, Tagore Garden, Vikaspuri, Trilokpuri-East, Badarpur, Timarpur, Nawada, Matiala, Rithala, Pitampura, Paschim Vihar, Lajpat Nagar, Jama Masjid, Paharganj, Najafgarh, Punjabi Bagh, Kasturba Nagar, Shastri Park, Mukherjee Nagar, Alipur, Narela, Ashok Vihar, IP Extension, Abul Fazl Enclave, Laxmi Nagar, Kalyanpuri, Sadar Bazar, Sriniwaspuri, Ballimaran, Deoli, and Pratap Nagar.The annual reserve license fee for the zones ranges between ₹220 crore and ₹225 crore, according to documents seen by HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-12-liquor-retail-zones-to-go-on-auction-today-bidding-closes-next-week-101629854926826.html
25-08-2021||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh to kick-off 2 day mega Covid vaccination drive from today||The Madhya Pradesh government will on Wednesday begin a two-day mega vaccination drive against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) called the “MP Vaccination Maha Abhiyan 2” drive , focusing on covering those people whose second dose is due. An official told news agency PTI on Tuesday that chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan will launch the campaign from the Jawahar Chowk area in the capital city of Bhopal. The state government has aimed to inoculate a total of 3.5 million people in these two days.The above-mentioned official said that on Wednesday, both first and second doses of the vaccine will be administered to beneficiaries while on Thursday, only those whose second dose is due will be covered.Chief minister Chouhan on Monday met Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya and urged for 1.1 million additional vaccine doses for the mega vaccination drive in the state. Chouhan informed that under the drive, the state government was committed to administer both vaccine doses to the entire eligible population of the state.Addressing the block, ward and village level crisis management committees regarding the vaccination drive on Tuesday, Chouhan instructed that all collectors, doctors, experts, public representatives and crisis management groups should put in their efforts to make the campaign successful.“Crisis management team and the administration should do a door-to-door survey. If there is confusion in anyone’s mind regarding the vaccine, then clear it. Vehicles should be arranged for the elderly people and others who have difficulty in coming to the vaccination centre,” Chouhan said. The chief minister also urged pregnant women to take the jab in order to ensure the safety of the mother as well as the child.“I am sure that with the cooperation of all of you, the Vaccination Maha Abhiyan will once again set new records of success and the Madhya Pradesh model of public participation will set an excellent example of vaccination across the country,” Chouhan said on Tuesday, according to a tweet posted by the chief minister’s office (CMO).In June, the Madhya Pradesh government launched the first mega vaccination campaign on the occasion of International Yoga Day (June 21), where it aimed towards vaccinating over one million beneficiaries.

25-08-2021||Mumbai||Narayan Rane arrested in Maharashtra over ‘slap CM’ remark||Maharashtra Police arrested Union minister Narayan Rane on Tuesday for saying he wanted to slap chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, prompting Shiv Sena workers to go on a rampage, and setting up another political face-off between the ruling three-party alliance and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Rane, who holds the micro, small and medium enterprises portfolio, is the first sitting central minister to be arrested in two decades, since Murasoli Maran and TR Baalu were picked up in an infamous midnight raid in Chennai by the Tamil Nadu Police in 2001.The senior BJP leader was arrested in Golavali in Ratnagiri district, where he was travelling as part of the Jan Ashirwad rallies newly inducted Union ministers are addressing across the country. He was arrested during his lunch break and was handed over to Raigad police around 2.45pm. A doctor examined him after the leader complained of high blood pressure and sugar level.The 69-year-old was produced in a court in Mahad in Raigad on Tuesday night and granted bail.Aniket Nikam, Rane’s counsel, said, “The bail has been granted on the ₹15,000 surety with four conditions. Rane will have to appear twice before Mahad police, he will have to ensure that the act will not be repeated. He will have to cooperate with the police for collection of voice samples. He will have to ensure that the evidence is not tampered with,” he said.He is facing three separate first information reports -- one in Mahad in Raigad, one in Nashik, and one in Pune.The First Information Report at Mahad was registered under Indian Penal Code sections 189 (threat of injury to public servant), 504 (intentional insult to provoke breach of public peace), and 505 (statements conducive to public mischief). The FIR in Nashik was filed under sections 500 (defamation), 505(2) (circulation of defamatory material), 153-b (1)(c) (commits any act which is prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony between different religious, racial, language or regional groups or castes or communities) of Indian Penal Code. Of the charges, section 153-b (1)(c) is a non-bailable offence.In a speech on Monday, Rane criticised Thackeray for allegedly confusing the number of years since India got independence during the chief minister’s August 15 address. “It is shameful that the chief minister does not know the year of independence. He leaned back to enquire [with his chief secretary] about the count of years of independence during his speech. Had I been there, I would have given him a slap under his ears?,” Rane had said. His comments sparked outrage.Sena workers hit the streets on Tuesday, put up posters against Rane, and slapped photos of the minister with shoes in Pune. Sena workers vandalised the BJP’s office In Amravati and set the party’s posters on fire, and demonstrated outside Rane’s Juhu bungalow and clashed violently with BJP members.Sena’s Ratanagiri-Sindhudurg MP Vinayak Raut even wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding Rane’s expulsion from the Cabinet. “Rane has belittled the constitutional framework by his statement. The Jan Ashirwad Yatra conceptualised by the PM was to seek the blessings of the people, instead of it, Rane has been issuing statements for the cheap publicity,” Raut said.Rane approached the Bombay high court challenging the FIRs against him and sought protection from arrest, but in vain.“File an application before the Registry department seeking urgent hearing and then we will consider,” said a division bench of justices SS Shinde and NJ Jamadar. “Everyone has to go through the process. Don’t make us do the job of the Registry,” the bench said.A court in Ratnagiri also rejected Rane’s anticipatory bail application.Hours before his arrest, Rane -- a former ally turned bitter critic of Thackeray -- appeared defiant. “I haven’t committed any crime. You should verify and show it on TV or else I will file a case against you (media). Despite not committing any crime, the media is showing speculative news about my ‘imminent’ arrest. Do you think I am a normal (ordinary) man?” Rane told reporters.After his arrest, he told news channel CNN News18 that he had no regrets.As per Rule 222A of the rules of procedure and conduct of business,when a member of the Upper House is arrested on a criminal charge or a criminal offence, it has to be immediately intimated to the chairperson of the Rajya Sabha. They also have to provide reasons for and the place of the arrest.Rule 222B says when a member is arrested and after conviction released on bail pending an appeal or is otherwise released, it too has to be intimated to the chairperson.A member enjoys protection from arrest in civil matters when the House is in session and 40 days before and after; but in criminal matters, only the chairman of the House needs to be informed.Nashik Police commissioner Deepak Pandey said they were following the rule book and the arrest order was issued as per legal provisions. “We have followed legal provisions and will ensure that privileges of the parliamentarian are protected. Since the Union minister is member of Rajya Sabha, we are bound to intimate chairman of the upper House in due course after the arrest,” he said.Constitutional expert Ulhas Bapat said, “The action can be taken against any Union minister, but the sections slapped against Rane do not attract the arrest. The action will not stand judicial scrutiny.”Rane’s arrest sparked a political tussle between the BJP and the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi, which comprises the Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress. The two have sparred since the Sena shocked the BJP by breaking its 25-year-old alliance and joining hands with traditional rivals Congress-NCP to form the government in 2019.State BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said they didn't justify Rane’s remarks but condemned the arrest. He said Union ministers, President, vice president and the Prime Minister have protection from arrest. “The state authorities which have been given the arrest orders should be aware of it. We do not justify the statement by Rane. He should have been given warning for his statement.”Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said the BJP did not support Rane’s comments but stood behind him “100 per cent”. “Action against Union minister Narayanrao Rane is absolute vendetta!We strongly condemn this gross misuse of police force & suppression,” he said.Union minister Smriti Irani condemned the arrest. “What happened in Maharashtra is against all norms, not only of decency of protocol, but also law. This is the depths to which depravity will now be politically exhibited in Maharashtra. It’s a sad day in our constitutional history,” she said.The NCP condemned Rane’s remarks and party chief Sharad Pawar said Rane was acting according to his “sanskar”.The Sena said Rane lost his mental balance. “Rane was inducted in the (Union) Cabinet just to attack the Shiv Sena, and while doing his job, he stooped to a new low,” said Raut. .The controversy comes months ahead of crucial local body elections in Mumbai and other cities in Maharashtra. Experts said Rane was elevated as Union minister to take on the Sena in its stronghold of Mumbai and coastal Konkan regions. It also revives an old rivalry between Thackeray and Rane, a former chief minister who revolted against the Sena chief in 2005, moved to the Congress with a dozen lawmakers in 2005, before joining the BJP in 2019.“Ä lot depends on how this controversy plays up in next few days. If the case against Rane falls in the court he will come out as a winner and BJP will get benefit in Konkan-Mumbai. On the other hand, the Sena leadership has shown aggression and given a message to the party cadre that they should take on Rane-BJP in coming elections,” said Hemant Desai, a political analyst.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/narayan-rane-arrested-in-maharashtra-over-slap-cm-remark-101629838548843.html
25-08-2021||Chandigarh||Dr Pyare Lal Garg, the social, health activist known for his ‘outspoken’ nature||Under fire for taking on chief minister Amarinder Singh for his frequent criticism of Pakistan, Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu’s adviser Dr Pyare Lal Garg, the former registrar of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS), Faridkot, is a known social and health activist. Garg, 73, who retired as professor of paediatric surgery in 2002 and is known for his outspoken nature, has worked both with the Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party (SAD-BJP) as well as Congress governments in Punjab. A native of Ladha Kothi village in Sangrur district, Garg is said to have been influenced by the Left ideology since his school days. In 2006, he was appointed the BFUHS registrar by the then Congress government but had to step down from the spot after some varsity employees challenged his appointment in the Punjab and Haryana High Court. But he was asked to continue at the varsity as examination coordinator.Later, when the SAD-BJP government formed government in 2012 for the second time with Parkash Singh Badal at the helm, he was appointed director of the Punjab State Health System Resource Centre at the CM’s native village Badal in Muktsar district.Senior officials in the health department say it was when Garg came close to the Sidhu family as Dr Navjot Kaur Sidhu was the chief parliamentary secretary (CPS health) at the time. In 2019, he was appointed chairman of the ‘Padho Punjab’ committee set up by the state education department.While Garg’s detractors say he cleverly used his links to get plum posts in the government, he on the other hand, claims that he has not accepted any payment for all the post-retirement assignments. Before joining as adviser to the PPCC chief, Garg frequently appeared on TV debates as an expert. He often quotes the Hindu and Sikh scriptures. “People may call me leftist but I follow every positive thinker in the world. I have read Karl Marx but then I have read Gandhi, Madan Lal Dhingra and Abdul Kalam Azad as well,” says Garg, who is often seen taking on the BJP-led NDA government on the issues of the Citizen Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens NRC and agitation against the farm laws.The controversy over his recent remark, says Garg, it was uncalled for. “I had only said that defence and foreign affairs are the domains of the Centre. As a chief minister, Amarinder should not give statement with regards to Pakistan. No chief minister has the right to speak on sensitive defence matters,” said Garg.“I am always there for Navjot Sidhu as I see something different in him,” he adds.Interestingly, Garg claimed that he never met Sidhu before his appointment as adviser.“I met Sidhu for the first time in Patiala on Monday. Before appointing as an adviser, Sidhu called up and said he wanted my expert opinions on matters concerning the state. There was no reason to say no,” said Garg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dr-pyare-lal-garg-the-social-health-activist-known-for-his-outspoken-nature-101629837605609.html
25-08-2021||Gurugram||After spree of cold-blooded killings, suspect surrenders||A retired army subedar allegedly murdered four people, including his daughter-in-law, with a knife used to prune plants early on Tuesday morning, and later walked into a police station with the murder weapon to confess his crime.The other three victims were the tenant Krishan Tiwari, 45, his wife, Anamika Tiwari, 35, and the couple’s nine-year-old daughter. They all suffered multiple stab wounds. The couple’s younger daughter, a three-year-old, survived the attack and is battling for life in hospital, police said. According to investigators,the accused, Rao Rai Singh, suspected that his daughter-in-law, 40-year-old Sunita Yadav, was in a relationship with Krishan Tiwari.DCP Deepak Saharan said the four murders took place between 2.30am and 4am on Tuesday. “Prima facie, evidence suggests the suspect, Rao Rai Singh Yadav, 59, a retired subedar of the Indian Army, bolted all the doors of the house and murdered four people with a long knife used for pruning garden plants, when the victims were sleeping on different floors of the building,” Saharan said.Yadav surrendered at the Rajendra Park police station around 6am, and told the police that he has murdered four people in his house. A team station reached the spot and recovered the bodies around 7am.The relatives of the deceased have been informed and a post-mortem examination was conducted by a board doctors on Tuesday evening, Saharan said. The report was still awaited.“First, he murdered Sunita Yadav, who was sleeping on the first floor, and then went to the second floor and killed three tenants with the weapon. A minor daughter of the tenant who was also attacked, survived,” assistant commissioner of police (crime) Preet Pal Sangwan said.Police said that despite gruesome injuries, nobody in the house or the neighbours heard any cries due to the noise from air coolers. “It was a sudden attack and Rao took everyone by surprise, giving them no time to react,” Saharan said. Yadav’s wife has told the police that she was asleep, and his son, Anand Yadav, said that he was in Shyam Khatu in Rajasthan. The police are verifying their locations.Singh stays in a three-storey building with his wife, son, and daughter-in-law on the first floor. On the second floor, Krishan Tiwari lived with his wife and their two daughters.“A three-year-old girl, who had suffered multiple stab injuries, was breathing when the teams reached. She was immediately sent to a hospital. Later, she was referred to Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital where the doctors described her condition as critical. We are questioning Singh, his wife, and son, who are also suspects,” Saharan said.ACP Sangwan said that Yadav’s son, Anand, is a lawyer in the Gurugram court. He told police that he reached the city only on Tuesday morning. “His phone location will be checked to establish his whereabouts,” said Sangwan.“This is a cold-blooded, gruesome murder. There are signs of injuries on bodies that appear to have been caused after death... The suspect has told the police that he kept stabbing his victims,” Sangwan added.A team of forensic experts, fingerprint experts and crime teams lifted samples from the crime scene on Tuesday afternoon, and a team of cyber crime police station has been involved for technical surveillance.Dr Deepak Mathur, the forensic expert who conducted the autopsy of the bodies, said Kishan Tiwari suffered seven stab wounds to his head and neck. His wife Anamika suffered 22 injuries on her neck, face and head, her daughter had 16 injury marks, and Sunita had 17 grave injuries. “We have also found fractures in the skull of victims. The fingers were partially chopped due to the likely resistance put up by victims,” he said.The neighbours claimed that Singh was allegedly concerned for the past few months over domestic issues. “Initial inquiry suggests there was no trouble within the family,” said Saharan.Delhi resident Ashwani Mishra, Tiwari’s brother-in-law, said the police informed him about the incident. “I was shocked to find all the family members lying in a pool of blood. The landlord was troubling them, and was not ready to return their security deposit. Krishan had come to our house in Delhi on Rakshabandhan and told us how the landlord tried to molest his wife several times. They wanted to move out of the house at the earliest,” he alleged.The police did not respond to queries about his allegations.Another relative said that Tiwari was living in the house for the last two years.

They were brought on a transit remand from Jammu on Monday and sent on 10-day police remand in Kaithal.As per the investigation, Jitender had promised to give the questions to another accused Muzaffar Ahmad Khan of Ramban district of Jammu for ₹6 lakh.On August 3, Jitender allegedly gave the copy of questions to Muzaffar and he promised to give him the money after the exam. Then on August 5, Muzaffar had sold the questions and their answers to Afzal of Hazratbal in Srinagar for ₹60 lakh with the help his friend Ajaz.Another accused, Nazir Ahmad Khande, had arranged a meeting between Afzal and Raj Kumar of Khanda Kheri village of Hisar and given the answer key and questions to Raj Kumar at Delhi Airport on August 5, two days before the exam on August 7 and 8.The SP claimed that Raj Kumar had paid ₹5 lakh cash to Afzal and promised to pay the remaining amount on August 9 and 10.

25-08-2021||Chandigarh||Murder case: HC restrains CBI judge from pronouncing verdict against Ram Rahim||The high court on Tuesday restrained a special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court, Panchkula, from pronouncing the final verdict in a murder case involving Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim. The high court bench of justice Arvind Sangwan acted on the plea of victim Ranjit Singh’s son, Jagseer Singh, who had sought directions for the transfer of the case to any other court in the region. The CBI special judge, Sushil Kumar Garg, was to pronounce the judgment on August 26. Ram Rahim is one of the accused in the murder of Ranjit Singh, committed in 2002. As per CBI, Ranjit Singh was murdered as Ram Rahim suspected that he was behind the circulation of an anonymous letter on sexual exploitation of female disciples on Dera premises. Ram Rahim stands convicted for 20 years rigorous imprisonment for raping two female disciples, in 2017 and subsequently convicted for life for the murder of a Sirsa-based journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati, who had published an article in his newspaper, regarding sexual exploitation of Sadhvis in Dera. The son had questioned adjournments granted by the CBI judge a number of times since his joining in April this year. “Everything has been manipulated through the respondent No.2 (KP Singh, public prosecutor for CBI),” alleges the son. His plea also refers to some complaint pending before chief justice in which there are allegations of the CBI judge remaining in touch with an accused in an enforcement directorate case. The plea states KP Singh, was previously posted with the CBI special court, Chandigarh, when Garg too was posted at Chandigarh and after his transfer to Panchkula, KP Singh too was transferred to Panchkula. He has been “interfering” in the “administration of justice” and is “influencing” the entire proceedings despite the fact there are two other special public prosecutors appointed for the trial, it was alleged. If the CCTV footage installed in the court is seen, KP Singh, is attending the court even on Saturday, which is not a court working day, the son claimed further adding that he had reasonable “apprehension” that he may not “get justice” from the special judge. The court while posting the matter for August 27 has sought comments from the CBI judge and issued notice to KP Singh and CBI. It further ordered that till the next date of hearing, final pronouncement of the judgment shall remain stayed. The court also asked CBI to file a specific affidavit about the appointment of KP Singh at CBI court, Panchkula, along with his posting order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/murder-case-against-ram-rahim-hc-restrains-cbi-judge-from-pronouncing-verdict-101629836825291.html
25-08-2021||Chandigarh||Amarinder okays hike in sugarcane prices, farmers end rail, road blockades||Farmers seeking increase in sugarcane prices called off their protest on Tuesday after Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh accepted their demand and announced a state-advised price (SAP) of ₹360 per quintal for the crop, an increase of ₹35 per quintal from the existing rate, applicable from the upcoming crushing season. Protesters had blocked a national highway and rail tracks in Jalandhar, saying the recent hike announced by the state government was inadequate as their production cost had spiralled considerably. Their demand had also got the backing of state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, who demanded better prices for Punjab farmers and had said the rates should be increased immediately. Around 360 trains were affected in the past six days due to the agitation, causing huge loss to the Railways. “Happy to share that after consultation with farmers, have approved SAP for sugarcane at ₹360 per quintal. My government is committed to the welfare of our farmers. Jai Kisan, Jai Jawan!” Amarinder said in a tweet. Earlier, the two rounds of talks between the officers of state agriculture department and farmers had remained inconclusive. In today’s meeting, a proposal to increase SAP to ₹345 per quintal was made to the cane growers initially. The farmers rejected it following which the CM intervened and increase the SAP to ₹360. With this increase, the SAP in Punjab is now highest in the country, even ₹2 per quintal more than the neighbouring Haryana. Protesting farmers had earlier said that if Haryana could give a good SAP price, then why can’t Punjab. According to farm leaders, both states have a similar crop pattern and has almost same amount of sugar content – about 9.6% --- in canes. Amarinder accepted that cane prices were not increased in the previous years due to state’s poor fiscal health, adding that balancing the needs of farmers and cooperative and private sugar mill owners was tough, given the prevailing fiscal situation. “We are satisfied with price assured by the CM and have decided to call off the strike immediately,” said BKU’s Balbir Singh Rajewal who was leading the protest. In Jalandhar, protesting farmers cleared the road and rail blockades to ensure smooth flow of traffic. According to the agriculture department, sugarcane is being grown over 93,000 hectares (2.27 lakh acres) and the increase in price will benefit 50,000 farmers. The SAP hike, however, is a concern for the sugarmill owners. ”Who will bear the escalated cost,” asked a mill owner, pleading anonymity.Haryana model to be adopted According to Congress MLA Rana Gurjit Singh, who was part of the talks, the chief minister also agreed to adopt Haryana model to support sugar mill owners. Under this, the mill owners will pay fair remunerative price (FRP) fixed by the Centre to the farmers. The over and above amount will be paid by the government. “The prices have also been linked to recovery of sugar and sugar prices. It means if recovery is more than the state’s average of 9.6% and sugar is fetching higher prices, there will be lesser burden on the government,” added Rana Gurjit. The state government is still to make a formal announcement in this regard. There are 16 sugar mills in the state, nine in the cooperative sector and seven are privately owned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amarinder-okays-hike-in-sugarcane-prices-farmers-end-rail-road-blockades-101629836765303.html
25-08-2021||Chandigarh||HC disposes of plea from Khemka on Central government empanelment||The high court on Tuesday disposed of a plea from Haryana IAS officer Ashok Khemka, challenging a Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) order, wherein, his plea seeking direction to Centre to consider his empanelment was dismissed.The high court disposed of the plea, with a direction that in case he files a fresh representation within two weeks, the authority concerned shall pass a speaking order, not later than a month. Earlier, Khemka had told court that he is merely seeking consideration for empanelment on aspect which was not considered by the CAT. The Tribunal proceeded on a wrong premise that the petitioner was seeking a direction to empanel him, his counsel had told court, adding that he would be satisfied, if his representation is decided by the Centre. Khemka had moved high court in July 2020 after CAT dismissed his plea. He had argued that non-empanelment at this stage would lead to cascading effect and he will not be able to serve at the Centre permanently. The eligibility criteria for such empanelment required minimum three years’ service at the Centre at the level of deputy secretary and above. He offered himself on a number of occasions, but was not appointed “without any fault on his part”, he had argued. CAT dismissed the plea, observing that the appointment of a person at Centre can’t be a matter of right. Khemka — who was the topper in computer science and engineering at IIT-Kharagpur in 1988 before he joined the civil services — has been transferred over 50 times in 27 years of his service. Khemka has had run-ins with successive governments on various issues. In HC, the Centre had told court that he cannot be considered for appointment as he did not fulfill the eligibility criterion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-disposes-of-plea-from-khemka-on-central-government-empanelment-101629836585128.html

A Karnal-based woman had come forward and claimed to be the biological mother but the district child welfare committee (CWC) had sent the baby to an orphanage, pending a DNA test. But two months on, the woman, identified as Jyoti, claims that neither has a DNA test been conducted nor are the police letting her take custody of her child. “They are not even letting me see my baby, who has been away from me since September last year. If the baby recovered is not mine, then why have the police arrested a couple for illegal adoption? And why has a DNA test still not been conducted?” said Jyoti, who has moved court over the issue. The woman, who works as an agricultural labourer and lives with her two children in a rented accommodation, said, “I don’t even have enough money to pay the lawyer.” She further said that since the recovery of her baby on June 25, she was not told anything about him. “Recently, I came to know that he has some medical issues and has been shifted to an orphanage in Panchkula. I am concerned about his health, but I am not being allowed to see him,” said Jyoti. Karnal CWC chairman Umesh Chanana said the baby had initially been sent to an orphanage in Karnal but later shifted to Bal Niketan, Panchkula, so that he could get treatment from PGI Chandigarh. The size of his head is not normal, and he needs emergency treatment for it, Chanana added. On why the baby was not handed over to his mother, he said, “The baby will be handed over only after tests confirm that she is the biological mother. She has to move court for custody of the baby.” Though the Meerut-based couple is in custody for illegal adoption, another accused in the case is yet to be arrested. Jyoti had claimed that a doctor had taken her baby after birth on the pretext of providing him free treatment at his hospital in Meerut. Karnal superintendent of police Ganga Ram Punia said, “The child has been shifted to Panchkula due to some health issues and necessary procedure for DNA examination is underway.” He said the custody issue of the boy is pending but sincere efforts are being made for the arrest of the remaining accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/karnal-illegal-adoption-case-2-months-on-rescued-baby-yet-to-be-reunited-with-biological-mom-101629836165135.html
25-08-2021||Chandigarh||Four state ministers, two dozen Congress MLAs revolt against Punjab CM Amarinder Singh||The Congress government in Punjab plunged into a fresh crisis as four cabinet ministers and nearly two dozen legislators declared open rebellion against chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh in the state, expressing total “lack of faith” in him. The disgruntled leaders, including cabinet ministers Tript Rajinder Bajwa, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Charanjit Singh Channi and Sukhbinder Sarkaria and state unit general secretary (organisation) Pargat Singh, who met at Bajwa’s official residence here, decided to urge the party high command to replace the chief minister. “We do not have any faith in the chief minister as he has not fulfilled promises made before the 2017 assembly elections,” three of the ministers said after the meeting. The unfulfilled promises such as delay in justice in sacrilege and police firing cases, arrest of the big fish in drug rackets and cancellation of power purchase agreements listed by them are part of the 18-point agenda handed by the central leadership to the chief minister two months ago for implementation. Randhawa told reporters that they had no confidence left in him (Amarinder), but changing the chief minister was the prerogative of the party high command. Bajwa, who along with Randhawa was among the ministers considered close to Amarinder until a few months ago, was more scathing in his criticism and accused the chief minister of “colluding” with Akalis.“The high command needs to take drastic steps. If there is a need to change the chief minister, then it should be done,” he said. Asked if this was an attempt to oust the chief minister, Bajwa said it was not an attempt but the demand of the people. The disgruntled leaders authorised a five-member delegation, including four ministers and Pargat, who were with Navjot Singh Sidhu in his tussle with Amarinder, to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi and apprise her of the sentiment prevailing in the party at the earliest. The ministers immediately spoke to All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat and will travel to Dehradun to meet him before heading to the national capital. Rawat said the ministers and MLAs had sought time and would meet him on Wednesday. “I will hear them and inform the high command about their issues. However, no one has talked to me about any demand for leadership change in the state,” he said. On the latest flare-up, the Punjab affairs in-charge said that Sidhu and the chief minister should see why such a situation had arisen. “This should not have happened. I have already said certain things that should not happen are being done in different constituencies. There should not be a situation where if someone disagrees with us, action is taken against him with revenue as the motive. If such things are happening, it should be stopped. Only Capt can do that,” he said. Though it was claimed by some of those present that 32 legislators attended the meeting, the ministers refused to give their number and names. “We will tell this to the high command. Several MLAs are scared and not willing to come out in the open at this stage,” one of the CM’s detractors said. The Congress has 80 MLAs in the 117-strong state assembly. Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, who was not present at the meeting, later met some of these ministers and MLAs at the party’s state headquarters here. “Got a call from Tripat Bajwa ji asking for an emergency…Met him along with other colleagues at the PPCC office. Will appraise the high command of the situation (sic),” he tweeted after meeting them. Sidhu has also been feeling the heat over his two advisers Malwinder Singh Mali and Dr Pyare Lal Garg whose controversial remarks on sensitive issues such as Kashmir and Pakistan have drawn flak from within and outside the ruling party. Besides Amarinder, several other party leaders, including five cabinet ministers from the Capt camp, have lashed out at the two advisers, asking the state Congress chief to rein them in. Addressing the media after the meeting at Bajwa’s house, Channi said that a lot of promises had been fulfilled, but some promises (the implementation of) that may lead to friction with the opposition were unfulfilled. “The issues are not getting resolved the way the Congress wants, and we were promised. We no longer believe that these issues will be resolved. Therefore, we are seeking time from the party high command for a meeting,” said Channi, flanked by Randhawa, Bajwa and Pargat. Channi said nothing happened after the questioning of (former chief minister) Parkash Singh Badal and (SAD president) Sukhbhir Badal by the SIT in the Kotkapura police firing incident. The flare-up between Sidhu and Amarinder came four days after their twin decisions to form a 10-member “strategic policy group” that included the two of them and make the ministers available at the party office by rotation were seen in the Congress circles as the first sign of thaw in their strained relations ahead of next year’s assembly elections. Tuesday’s developments were a throwback to a crisis that engulfed the Congress in May, when Sidhu rallied Singh’s detractors and publicly accused the CM of enabling corruption. Tensions between 79-year-old Singh and Sidhu had simmered since the latter quit the state cabinet after the chief minister changed his portfolio in 2019. To resolve the crisis, the Congress set up a three-member panel, which met around 150 functionaries – including Singh twice -- and submitted its report to party president Sonia Gandhi on June 10. On July 18, Sidhu was named state unit chief -- a post he coveted -- overriding strong objections from Singh. The two leaders were seen at key meetings together and the CM even attended the ceremony where Sidhu took charge of the party in Punjab. But the latest round of infighting shatters that fragile truce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/four-state-ministers-two-dozen-congress-mlas-revolt-against-punjab-cm-amarinder-singh-101629835985315.html
25-08-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A family man||It’s Raksha Bandhan festival and Parash Ram is wondering what if he were in his village in Lalitpur, MP, this day. “My sister, Preeti, would have tied rakhi on my wrist.” After a pause, he says—“I’ve a big family but I’m lonely. They are all in the village.”This late afternoon Mr Ram is alone in his Delhi home. It is a roadside camp, in a neighbourhood lined with gleaming apartment complexes. Mr Ram’s home is transitory, he informs. A labourer, his address keeps shifting, depending on the assignment he gets from his “thekedar,” the contractor. Currently, he is a “water pump operator.” Pointing to a machine parked across the road, he says his “duty” is to start it each time the road gets flooded during the monsoon showers, whether it be midday or midnight. “The machine quickly drains away the rainwater.”The roof in Mr Ram’s home is very low; it’s impossible to stand up straight. He is sitting crosslegged by the entrance, watching the empty road. His pink chappals are lying beside his bare feet, on the footpath. The white bed-sheet spread across the floor is perfectly ironed. It turns out to be a “tirpal”, a plastic awning.All homes show at least some trappings of daily living. But this residence is completely empty. Where’s the dinner plate, the towel, the tooth brush? Mr Ram smiles. He says two of his colleagues who work with the same contractor but are busy in other assignments keep all his things with them. They are currently residing under a flyover, nearby, where the water supply and bathroom facility is more easily accessible. Mr Ram walks to these colleagues twice a day for the meals that they quickly cook together. His clothes too are with them.This afternoon the sky is clear of rain clouds. The road is dry. “My duniya (world) is in my village—my eldest brother Dhani Ram; my younger brother Mohan; my sister Preeti is married with two children; my wife Gayatri with our two daughters—Sanskriti and… the other one has no name, she is four months old.”He talked to his sister the previous evening on mobile phone. “I’ll visit the family after the rains… I’ll then celebrate Rakhsha Bandhan with Preeti.” While sharing the travel plans, Mr Ram’s face breaks into a smile. He now gets up and stretches out his arms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-family-man-101629835716664.html
25-08-2021||Chandigarh||Monsoon session: Haryana Congress demands CBI probe into constable recruitment paper leak||The Congress on Tuesday demanded that a CBI probe should be ordered in the examination paper leak for recruitment of constables in Haryana police. Speaking during a calling attention motion, leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said that committees in every district should be set up to find out how many people paid money to buy the leaked paper. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said a crime syndicate was behind the paper leaks and the police was chasing the perpetrators. “If the state police are not able to get to the bottom of this matter, we will get this matter inquired by another entity,” he said. In a written reply, Parliamentary affairs minister Kanwar Pal said that Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) has recruited 78,701 candidates to various Group C-D posts since 2015 even as the examination was cancelled on five occasions. “The nefarious elements in the society have always targeted the examination process. Thus, job aspirants are willing to shell out large sums of money to gain an unfair advantage and organised gangs operate with the objective of acquiring the question paper illegally and then making pecuniary gains out of the sale of such papers,” he said. The examinations so far cancelled include that of gram sachiv, assistant lineman, upper divisional clerk, various categories of posts and male constable (general duty).During the conduct of examination on August 7, it came to the notice of the commission that the paper had been leaked following which, it was decided to cancel the recruitment process. A total of seven criminal cases were registered in respect of leak of question paper. Two cases were lodged in Kaithal, one case each in Fatehabad and Hisar and three cases in Karnal. The police have arrested 35 persons in this regard and the matter is being thoroughly investigated by Haryana Police, he said. Since 2011, 30 criminal cases pertaining to written examinations have been registered. Of these 30 cases, four were cancelled; accused were acquitted in two cases; investigation is going on in 10 cases; and 14 cases are pending adjudication in the courts, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/monsoon-session-haryana-congress-demands-cbi-probe-into-constable-recruitment-paper-leak-101629835625187.html
25-08-2021||Chandigarh||Congress opposes amendment in land acquisition law in Haryana, walks out of House||The opposition Congress MLAs on Tuesday staged a walkout from the House to register their protest against the passage of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Haryana Amendment) Bill in the assembly. The amendment Bill proposes to exempt certain development projects, rural infrastructure, affordable housing, industrial corridors, health, education and urban metro rail projects from the ambit of social impact assessment study and provision to safeguard food security. Congress MLAs led by leader of the opposition, Bhupinder Singh Hooda demanded that the Bill should be held back and referred to a select committee of the House for scrutiny. Congress MLA from Tosham, Kiran Choudhry said the amendment Bill was anti-farmer and anti-poor. “The principal Act of 2013 is a benevolent legislation which takes care of the interests of landowners and farmers. However, this amendment Bill proposes to do away with the requirement of taking the prior consent of at least 70% of the land losing families for acquisition of land for public private partnership (PPP) projects,” said Choudhry. Congress MLA from Rohtak, Bharat Bhushan Batra said the proposed amendments were outside the stated objects and reasons of the principal Act. “The intent of this law was to have a consultative process for land acquisition and to determine the public purpose. These aspects were being done away with. This amendment Bill should be referred to a select committee of the House,” said Batra. Leader of opposition, Bhupinder Singh Hooda said that the amendment Bill reeked of crony capitalism. It aims to give vast powers to the government in matters of land acquisition and puts the stakeholders at complete disadvantage, said Hooda. First-time Congress MLA from Dabwali, Amit Sihag said that since the Central government had also tried to amend the principal Act on similar lines without success, there is a need to have discussion on the proposed amendment. Seeking an addition in the amendment Bill, BJP MLA from Nangal Chaudhary, Abhe Singh Yadav said in Section 10 A (c) of the amendment Bill, which empowered the government to exempt certain projects pertaining to affordable housing, housing for poor people and for rehabilitation of persons displaced due to either acquisition of land by the state government or by any natural calamity, it is proposed that projects for rehabilitation of persons evicted from lands under any forest or archaeological site notified for the protection or preservation under any law in force for the time being, should also be exempted. Yadav’s proposed modification was carried out by revenue minister Dushyant Chautala. Supporting the amendment Bill, JJP MLA from Narnaund, Ram Kumar Gautam said since no land could be acquired for public purpose under the existing law, it was important to amend the principal Act. Defending the amendment Bill, the revenue minister said many state governments such as Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat have carried out similar amendments in the principal Act. The amendment Bill was passed by the assembly and will have to be reserved for the consideration of the President for his assent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-opposes-amendment-in-land-acquisition-law-in-haryana-walks-out-of-house-101629835385044.html

These godowns will have a storage capacity of 1.5 lakh MT. Stadium not feasible in Palwal: Sports minister Haryana minister of state for sports and youth affairs Sandeep Singh said that the construction of Swarna Jayanti Stadium in Palwal village of Kurukshetra district is not feasible because of a high-tension line in the area. He said that instead of a stadium, it has been decided to build boundary wall, athletics track, grassy ground or court for handball, volleyball, basketball and kabaddi games, office-cum storerooms and toilets. He said that at present, Dronacharya Stadium in Kurukshetra is a district-level stadium with multipurpose hall, athletic track, sports facilities for basketball, skating, badminton, judo, wushu, handball, hockey, volleyball, kho-kho, kabaddi and boxing.

He said 800 more computer labs will be set up during this fiscal. He informed that 2,036 computer faculty and 2,215 computer lab attendants are working to impart computer education in these labs. Replying to another question, education minister Kanwar Pal said norms have been relaxed to provide permanent recognition to private schools. He said the state government has reduced the area requirement for primary school from 500 square metres to minimum 250 square metres. Similarly, for middle school, it has been decreased from 800 sq mt to minimum 500 sq mt, for high schools from 2,000 sq mt to minimum 1,200 sq mt. Goel bats for uniform DC rates across districts BJP MLA Aseem Goel pleaded that there should be uniformity in what is called DC rate while employing people on contract basis.

25-08-2021||Chandigarh||Issued no order restraining banks from recovering car, gold loan during Covid-19, says HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has clarified that it has not issued any order restraining the banks or other financial institutions from recovering the amount on account of car loans and gold loans in view of the pandemic in the two states and Chandigarh. The bench of chief justice RS Jha and Justice Arun Palli was responding to a plea from various financial institutions that due to an April 28 order, they were unable to recover the loans and other dues from the debtors who were deliberately taking advantage of the said clause.Amicus curaie in the matter, senior advocate Anupam Gupta, had submitted that no specific instances of default have been mentioned by the banks in their applications. He had termed their applications “misconceived” and lacking “bona fide”.The court clarified that it has not granted any stay on the recovery of car or gold loans. The object and purpose of passing the interim order was only to stay the auction proceedings in respect of residential accommodations so that occupants of such units were not rendered homeless and exposed to further miseries, it said.The court was hearing a suo motu plea which was initiated on demand that certain measures be taken up so as to ensure that during the pandemic-triggered crisis, generation of litigation can be controlled for some time. It was initiated on April 28. The court also said that it had not granted any kind of stay facilitating filing of appeals before the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) or any other tribunal/authority without making pre-deposits as mandated. This clarification too was issued in view of some pleas whether tribunals, especially RERA, had been restrained from asking for pre-deposits in accepting appeals by builders as mandated by law.The high court has deferred hearing in the matter plea for August 31 to take a call on opening of courts, where functioning was restricted in view of second wave of pandemic in April. Earlier, the Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association had sought physical opening of courts in view of lesser prevalence of Covid-19 now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/issued-no-order-restraining-banks-from-recovering-car-gold-loan-during-covid-19-says-hc-101629834786368.html

There are large gurdwaras at these places. However, the Sikhs in large numbers have left this country due to the unfavourable situation with only a few staying there. Who will take care of these gurdwaras, Sikh heritage and relics is a question,” he said.The CKD chief said these gurdwaras and relics might be desecrated if the Centre did not take any concrete step in this direction. “The CKD will cooperate with the government in every possible way to look after the Sikh heritage and historic places. The Centre should take necessary action to ensure the care of these places and safety of the Sikhs still living there,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chief-khalsa-diwan-offers-children-of-evacuated-afghan-sikhs-free-education-in-its-institutes-101629834785364.html
25-08-2021||Chandigarh||Sukhbir faces farmers’ wrath in Muktsar||BATHINDAShiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal faced the wrath of farmer unions at public rallies for the second consecutive day on Tuesday in his home district of Muktsar.As a part of the pre-election campaign “Gall Punjab Di” scheduled for 100 days, Sukhbir on Tuesday visited Gidderbaha where he faced strong opposition from activists of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM).Represented by Congress’ Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, Gidderbaha was once considered a traditional stronghold of the Akalis. SAD patriarch Parkash Singh won from Gidderbaha five times in a row from 1969 to 1985 and in the later years also, the Akalis maintained electoral control over the segment.The former deputy chief minister was scheduled to hold nine public meetings, including one with the SKM leaders at a resort at Doda village in the Gidderbaha segment. However, farmer union activists demanded that the meeting between the SKM and Sukhbir be held in the presence of the media, to which the SAD leadership refused.Activists wanted an open dialogue with Sukhbir on farmers’ demands and other issues.Agitated over the stand, a large number of SKM activists gheraoed the venue for over an hour.Earlier in the day, SKM activists showed black flags to Sukhbir’s convoy being led by youth Akali workers during a motorbike rally.Dimpy Dhillon is SAD candidate from GidderbahaAt a workers meeting, Sukhbir announced the candidature of his close aide Hardeep Singh Dimpy Dhillon from the Gidderbaha segment. He said if voted to power, the SAD-BSP alliance would increase state assured price (SAP) of sugarcane to ₹380 per quintal.On Monday, SKM activists staged a protest against Sukhbir’s political events in the Malout constituency. A large gathering under the banner of SKM blocked the main entrance to a banquet hall on the Muktsar-Fazilka road where Sukhbir was holding a meeting with the party’s rural circle presidents and booth-level committee workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhbir-faces-farmers-wrath-in-muktsar-101629834665097.html
25-08-2021||Chandigarh||Amid concerns over privacy, Haryana assembly passes Parivar Pehchan Bill||Congress MLAs on Friday cited privacy concerns while opposing the enactment of Haryana Parivar Pehchan Bill, a legislation aimed at providing a unique identifier number to each family in the state for determination of eligibility for any scheme, service, subsidy or benefit provided by the state government. The Bill was, however, passed by the state assembly. Congress MLA Kiran Choudhry said the proposed legislation will enable the government of the day to misuse citizens’ data. “Why is this Bill being pushed in a haste. It is in violation of Supreme Court orders in KS Puttaswamy case and will be challenged in a court of law,” she said. The apex court, in its order, had said that every citizen has a fundamental right to privacy guaranteed by the Constitution. “The right to privacy is protected as an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 and as a part of the freedoms guaranteed by part III of the Constitution,” the SC order said. Insisting that the Bill be withdrawn, Choudhry said that data collection should have been done by an independent authority and state assembly should be the custodian of the data. Leader of the opposition, Bhupinder Singh Hooda said that the proposed legislation was not in the interest of democratic rights of citizens and should be withdrawn. Congress MLA from Jhajjar, Geeta Bhukkal questioned the need for such a piece of legislation. “Why do we need a family identity card when we already have multiple identity cards like Aadhar card and PAN. I would also like to know whether this I mandatory or voluntary,” said Bhukkal. Defending the Haryana Parivar Pehchan Bill, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said that Parivar Pehchan Patra (PPP) was not mandatory but voluntary. Dismissing privacy concerns, Khattar said that privacy issues are for wealthy people who do not want to share their income and wealth. “And if there is any breach of data, we will punish the perpetrators,” he said. Khattar said that government already has citizens’ data in its land records database, the public distribution system database and students’ database. “We are just consolidating it and bringing it under an umbrella,” he said. “No one has built a system for the benefit of the last person in the queue. Parivar Pehchan Patra (PPP) has been formulated to deliver the benefits of the schemes till the last person. The government has been working on it for the last three years and 64 lakh families have been registered in the PPP. Anyone who wants to take advantage of government service should have some document of being a resident of Haryana. As per the statement of objects and reasons of the Bill, a Parivar Pehchan Authority is proposed to be established for development of the policy, procedure, technology and systems for generating and issuing of Parivar Pehchan number to families residing in Haryana. The Authority shall collect, update, manage and maintain information of the family and its members in the form of specified data fields in the Family Information Data Repository and develop and implement mechanisms, processes and systems for authenticating or verifying such information. It shall provide verified and authenticated data based on the Parivar Pehchan number to all government departments, government agencies and local authorities for identification of beneficiaries or determination of eligibility or provision or implementation of any scheme, service, benefit or subsidy. It shall also maintain the security and confidentiality of data and information held by it in the Family Information Data Repository. Parivar Pehchan identifier can enable the proactive delivery without the beneficiary or recipient having to visit any government office. It will minimise the burden on production of documents and enable faceless and nameless anytime and anywhere delivery of schemes, services, subsidies and benefits. Other Bills passed The Panchkula Metropolitan Development Authority, Bill, 2021, the Haryana Goods and Services Tax (Second Amendment) Bill, 2021, the Haryana Public Examination (Prevention of Unfair Means) Bill, 2021, and the Haryana Appropriation (No. 3) Bill, 2021 were also passed in the House on Tuesday before it was adjourned sine die.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-concerns-over-privacy-haryana-assembly-passes-parivar-pehchan-bill-101629834184972.html

25-08-2021||Chandigarh||Capt camp hits back, wants action against PPCC president’s advisers||Chandigarh After open revolt by ministers and several MLAs belonging to Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president Navjot Singh Sidhu’s camp, five cabinet ministers and one MLA called for strong action under the law against the state chief’s advisers, Malwinder Mali and Pyare Lal Garg, for their “patently anti-national and pro-Pak comments”. “The statements of both these newly appointed advisers of Sidhu were clearly against India’s interests and detrimental to national security,” said cabinet ministers Brahm Mohindra, Vijay Inder Singla, Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Balbir Singh Sidhu and Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, along with MLA Raj Kumar Verka in a statement. Besides stringent legal action against Mali and Garg, they also urged the Congress national leadership to direct Sidhu to immediately rein in his aides in the interest of the party, as well as the country. “The Congress has made many sacrifices for the protection of the nation’s security and peace, as have our soldiers at the borders. Nobody can or should be allowed to undermine these sacrifices and jeopardise the safety of our country and its people,” they emphasised, citing, in particular, the grave implications such statements could have for the border state of Punjab. The Congress leaders also questioned Sidhu’s failure to put his foot down on such “anti-national and pro-Pak diatribe” by his close aides, despite the justified uproar it has triggered across party lines. Sidhu’s omission in this regard had given ammunition to the opposition parties, which were quick to recall the PPCC president’s own bonhomie with the Pakistan Prime Minister and army chief, they pointed out, warning against the massive damage this could cause to the Congress in the run-up to the 2022 Punjab assembly polls, which are due in less than six months. They termed Mali’s statement on Kashmir a dangerous and unacceptable deviation from India’s stated position on J&K. By questioning the unanimous 1994 resolution of the Parliament of India declaring Jammu & Kashmir as an integral of India (which was reiterated in 2012), Mali had blatantly toed the line of Pakistan, which had been trying to stake claim to the region and was in illegal occupation of certain areas, such as PoK, they added. The Congress leaders said that even Garg’s statement countering chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s criticism of Pakistan reflected strong pro-Pak leanings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-camp-hits-back-wants-action-against-ppcc-president-s-advisers-101629833824913.html
25-08-2021||Chandigarh||1984 riots case: Verify medical condition of Sajjan Kumar, SC directs CBI||The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to verify the medical condition of former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar, who is serving life imprisonment in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case and is seeking interim bail on health grounds.A bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy issued notice to the CBI on Kumar’s plea and asked it to file an affidavit within a week after verifying his medical condition.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the ex-MP, said Kumar should be taken to a private hospital for treatment as his condition had not been determined at a government hospital here.“We want the state to verify what his medical condition is,” the bench observed.Singh said Kumar was earlier treated by a doctor at a private hospital and he could be treated there.Senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for the complainant, said that Kumar had got anticipatory bail from the high court in 2010 and he was sent to jail only after he was convicted by the high court. “This is shocking,” he told the bench, adding that people were slaughtered during the riots.“I have serious reservation about private hospitals and these powerful accused,” Dave said, adding that the apex court had in September last year dismissed Kumar’s plea seeking interim bail on health grounds.When Singh said that Kumar is in a “very precarious condition”, Dave said in March last year, he was examined by an AIIMS board. They all get into precarious condition after slaughtering people, Dave said.“This is a precarious condition itself that he is in jail. That itself is a precarious condition,” the bench observed.As Singh said irresponsible statements should not be made, Dave argued “it is not irresponsible, it is a serious matter”.Singh said he had not argued anything on merits.“The medical condition of the petitioner should be verified and affidavit be filed within a week,” the bench said and posted the matter for hearing on September 6.Kumar is serving life imprisonment after the Delhi high court convicted him and others in the case on December 17, 2018.The high court had reversed the acquittal of Kumar by the trial court in 2013 in the case related to killings of five Sikhs in the Raj Nagar Part-I area in Palam Colony in southwest Delhi on November 1-2, 1984, and burning down of a gurdwara in Raj Nagar Part-II.The riots had broken out after the assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984 by her two Sikh bodyguards.In its verdict, the high court had convicted and sentenced Kumar to imprisonment for “remainder of his natural life” in the case saying the riots were a “crime against humanity” perpetrated by those who enjoyed “political patronage” and aided by an “indifferent” law enforcement agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/1984-riots-case-verify-medical-condition-of-sajjan-kumar-sc-directs-cbi-101629833704854.html

A total of 58 districts did not report any fresh case while 17 districts had fresh cases in single digit. Daily positivity rate is 0.01% and overall recovery rate is 98.6%”, said Adityanath at Covid 19 review meeting on Tuesday.Yogi said that all this was possible because of the concerted and continued efforts in following the policy of ‘trace, test, treat, and vaccination’. He asked the officers concerned to keep up the efforts and alertness.Regarding vaccination, Yogi said “This month so far, the state has administered 1.6 crore doses taking the total doses administered in the state so far to 6.42 crore. UP is the only state to do so,” he said asking officers concerned to be in regular touch with the central government for steady supply of vaccine.Regarding preparations for the possible third wave of the pandemic, Yogi asked the officials to be ready in advance and said so far, the state had arranged 6,600 PICU (pediatric ICU) and 5,850 NICU (neonatal ICU) beds. The state currently has 56,000 isolation beds and 18,000 ICU beds.In view of the reopening of schools from Tuesday for classes 6th to 8th, Yogi asked for cleanliness, sanitisation, use of mask and social distancing in schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/out-of-1-58-lakh-tests-28-found-positive-yogi-101629833585562.html
25-08-2021||Mumbai||Narayan Rane's arrest sets off a fresh war of words||The arrest of Union minister Narayan Rane on Tuesday over his controversial remarks about Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray sparked a political row.The Shiv Sena demanded Rane’s expulsion from the Union Cabinet and the Congress said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders need empathy and treatment for mental health.The BJP didn’t condone Rane’s remarks, but stood by its leader and said the action taken against him was uncalled for when similar remarks by Sena leaders, including CM Thackeray, go unnoticed.BJP national president JP Nadda said they aren’t scared and the ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’ -- in which newly inducted Union ministers are addressing rallies across the nation -- will continue in Rane’s absence.“The arrest of Union minister Narayan Rane ji by the Maharashtra government violates constitutional values. We will neither be scared nor pressured by it. They (MVA partners) are troubled by the immense support the BJP is getting in the ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’. We will continue to fight democratically, the journey will continue,” Nadda tweeted.Former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis didn’t condone Rane’s remarks and said people should refrain from passing derogatory remarks against people holding constitutional posts. “However, the arrest is uncalled for and is driven by political vendetta. It is a gross misuse of power and the police force is being used to suppress dissident voices. The violence in Maharashtra is state-sponsored,” said Fadnavis, who is the leader of opposition in the Maharashtra assembly.Fadnavis also warned the Shiv Sena over attacks on BJP offices in the state. “We do not advocate violent protest or reaction, but we will also not tolerate the attacks on our offices. It is strange that the police force has also been taking action on the directions of their political bosses. If you are taking action against Rane, why was there no action taken against chief minister Uddhavji Thackeray for his inflammatory language in his Dussehra rally speech or against the leaders who instigate workers to attack or call the PM a thief?” he said.Fadnavis said the party stands by Rane and his arrest was illegal as he was neither given the opportunity to explain nor served with a notice.Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil joined in and said Union ministers have protection from arrest under the Constitution.The Maha Vikas Aghadi allies condemned Rane’s remarks and endorsed the police action against him.Sena’s Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg MP Vinayak Raut wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, demanding Rane’s expulsion from the Cabinet. “Rane has belittled the constitutional framework by his statement. The Jan Ashirwad Yatra conceptualised by the PM was to seek the blessings of the people. Instead, Rane has been issuing statements for cheap publicity. He has lost his mental balance and has been ranting just to woo his political bosses,” Raut said.State Nationalist Congress Party chief Jayant Patil also condemned the remarks. “The statement made by Rane is certainly condemnable. The derogatory remarks against the chief minister is an insult to the people of Maharashtra. Such language was never used by a political leader in the past. This has also become an example for people of the state and the country to know the type of people selected by PM Narendra Modi and BJP-led government at the Centre,” Patil said.“All the political parties need to rethink about giving importance to the people who use such language. Even if the BJP is angry and hates Uddhav Thackeray, using such language against the chief minister is unfortunate and will have to be condemned,” Patil said when asked if the standard of politics is going down.He also chose to defend the Sena over agitations at several places and said that the party has been behaving responsibly ever since Uddhav Thackeray became the CM. But he clarified that not only Sena workers but even the common people are hurt by the derogatory remarks against their CM “and reaction would have come at a few places”NCP’s national spokesperson Nawab Malik said the BJP was looking to carry out “politics of violence by disturbing law and order” in Maharashtra.“But it will not be accepted by the people of Maharashtra,” he said.Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said, “No matter how many clashes, scandals and pressure from the (Narendra) Modi government at the Centre, the MVA government is not becoming unstable. In fact, it is becoming more and more popular. This is the reason BJP leaders have started using foul language, which shows their helplessness and depression. They (BJP leaders) need empathy, compassion and mental (health) treatment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/narayan-rane-s-arrest-sets-off-a-fresh-war-of-words-101629833404922.html
25-08-2021||Chandigarh||7 Cong leaders deny being part of move to replace Amarinder||Seven of the 20-odd Punjab Congress MLAs and ex-MLAs, who were purported to have been party to the demand for the removal of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, have completely disassociated themselves from any such move. Denying being part of what they termed as “a conspiracy hatched by a section engaged in trying to drive a wedge within the party”, these seven leaders – MLAs Kuldeep Vaid, Dalvir Singh Goldy, Santokh Singh Bhalaipur, Angad Saini, Raja Warring, Gurkirat Singh Kotli and ex-MLA Ajit Singh Mofar – threw their weight behind the chief minister and reposed their full faith in his leadership, according to a statement issued by the chief minister’s media adviser Raveen Thukral. Their denial came within hours of a list of party MLAs and ex-MLAs circulated by a section of the Punjab Congress, which claimed that these leaders wanted the replacement of Captain Amarinder Singh and intended taking up the matter with the high command, it said. All seven of them said the closed-door meeting held at Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa’s residence, after which their names were fraudulently released along with others, had been convened to discuss party affairs. Some of the participants tried to raise the issue of the chief minister’s replacement but, contrary to claims, no unanimous resolution was passed or agreed upon. Taking strong exception to the misuse of their names in this manner, these seven made it clear that they do not subscribe to any such move against Amarinder. Mofar, in fact, said he did not even attend the said meeting and had merely gone to meet one of the cabinet ministers present there. He said he was shocked to see his name being touted as one of those seeking Amarinder’s removal. Vaid made it clear he was “not part of any such conspiracy against the chief minister”, while Goldy firmly put his might behind Capt Amarinder. Angad said he had gone to the meeting to discuss cooperative elections in his constituency, and Warring said he was not even aware of any such discussion being held during the meeting. Bhalaipur and Kotli also denied any talk of the chief minister’s replacement taking place at the meeting, and added that there was no question of being party to such a demand. All seven of them condemned the attempts by a section of the Punjab Congress to trigger revolt in the party ahead of the 2022 assembly elections, especially when the high command had already resolved the differences between Sidhu and Amarinder. With the polls just months away, the party needs to work unitedly, as one integrated whole, and not fritter away its political advantage by indulging in petty politicking to promote personal vested interests, they said. They urged the Congress leadership to take immediate steps to quell any attempts to divide the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/7-cong-leaders-deny-being-part-of-move-to-replace-amarinder-101629833524849.html

The completed project will fulfil the city’s maximum electricity requirement, including that of the Shriram Temple Complex, through the green power, to be generated by rooftop solar panels, people dealing with the issue said.According to them, the government is also considering changes in the Solar Policy, 2017 to provide more incentives to people who opt for rooftop solar panels, so that the Ayodhya model may be replicated in more cities, especially those of religious importance.“L&T is almost ready with the Ayodhya DPR, detailing the plan to convert the town into a solar city by installing solar panels on roofs of houses, government buildings, commercial and industrial establishments etc. This will be on a pilot basis in the first phase after which some other cities will also be identified for the same purpose,” Bhawani Singh Khangarot, director, Uttar Pradesh New and Renewable Energy Development Agency (UPNEDA) said.An L&T survey found Ayodhya’s (3.40 lakh population) annual electricity consumption to be 281 million units by 0.81 lakh households. “The NEDA is basically working on four things in Ayodhya, that is, solar generation from ground-mounted utility scale and solar plants, arranging solar cooking for community kitchens for devotees, fulfilling energy requirement of the Shriram Temple Complex from solar and other renewable sources,” he said.Simultaneously, the NEDA has also proposed changes to the solar policy, seeking more incentives to people and government, semi-government and commercial bodies to install rooftop panels on houses/buildings.The NEDA has proposed enhancement of state subsidy on installation of rooftop solar panels by residents in the cities identified to be declared as solar cities. Ajay Kumar, another NEDA official said that the enhanced state-subsidy would be in addition to the subsidy already provided by the Central government. “We have also proposed net metering facility for government and semi-government buildings and commercial and industrial establishments that use grid-connected rooftop solar panels to generate power in solar cities. The net metering will enable them to sell excess electricity to the UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) through net meters,” he added.Domestic and agriculture consumers already have the net metering facility. The UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) did away with this facility for government buildings and commercial/industrial establishments in 2019.The third proposal mooted by the NEDA seeks to solarise Nagar Nigams of cities identified as solar ones. “According to the proposal, the Nagar Nigam will meet its energy needs for street lighting, water works etc from the renewable power through the ‘Open Access’,” Kumar said.The amendment proposals, he said, have been sent to the government which was likely to take a call on the issue soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/solar-city-ayodhya-dpr-in-the-pipeline-govt-to-amend-solar-policy-101629833416151.html

We will intensify our protest if our demands are not met,” said NHM employees. Health centres in Mauli village, Raipur Khurd, Daria and Khuda Lahora were completely shut on Tuesday.Meanwhile, Dr Amandeep Kang, director, health services, UT, said, “We have written a letter to the Centre requesting them to either increase the annual NHM budget for UT or to give us approval for hiking their salaries from the UT administration’s budget. We are waiting to hear back from them.”UT adviser Dharam Pal said, “I had a discussion with the health secretary and the DHS. The administration will approach the Union government and I will be writing a letter to the Centre shortly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhmedical-services-hit-as-nhm-employees-go-on-strike-101629833285264.html

25-08-2021||Chandigarh||Four years on, no one held guilty for dera violence in Panchkula||Moments after the CBI special court had found Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim guilty of raping two women disciples, four years ago this day on August 25, lakhs of his followers had turned Haryana into a war zone of bloodshed and destruction, leaving 36 persons dead and 423 injured.Ram Rahim’s followers had pelted stones, destroyed outstation broadcasting (OB) vans of news channels and buildings, burnt vehicles and attacked security forces. When tear gas shells had proved ineffective, police had fled from the nakas, giving way to paramilitary forces, who had “shot to kill”.Police record shows that 29 buildings were damaged, 74 vehicles including two fire brigades were set ablaze, three OB vans, one school bus and 57 vehicles, including one ambulance, were vandalized in Panchkula. The police had also seized five pistols/revolvers, four rifles, including an AK-47, two guns, one Mauser and 58 vehicles.However, four years have passed, yet no one has been convicted.Aditya Insaan, a former spokesperson of the dera, had fled the spot just after the verdict. He continues to carry a police reward of ₹5 lakh on his head and was declared a proclaimed offender (PO) on May 21 this year.Three more persons, Amrik Singh, Phool Kumar and Abhijeet, are wanted by the police and carry a ₹1 lakh bounty each on their heads.Panchkula police had registered 177 FIRs against 2,318 accused; 20 FIRs were clubbed on court’s direction. In total, 2,167 persons have been arrested and are facing trial. Currently, trials are going on in 143 cases.The police could not trace accused five cases, and the remaining 152 cases are pending in district court, Panchkula. “To date, none has been convicted,” according to police data. At least 46 accused in nine cases have been acquitted.Cases fell flat in courtNine special investigation teams (SITs) were formed to investigate cases of violence, but they all fell flat in court. The first such case that fell flat in court on April 30, 2018, was related to FIR 415 of 2017, registered in Sector 5. Six persons, accused of rioting and snatching at Hafed Chowk, were acquitted. They had been arrested on the complaint of a Mohali-based photojournalist, whose video camera and tripod were snatched. The court acquitted them as “prosecution lacked evidence”.In 2020, the eighth dera violence case (FIR 363) fell flat after an additional district and sessions judge acquitted 10 dera followers, accused of attempt to murder, riot and damaging public property. The three eyewitnesses that the prosecution presented failed to identify the accused and instead said that a mob had set a fire tender ablaze in which a fireman was injured.In a 19-page judgment, the judge had held that the prosecution was not able to establish its case beyond reasonable doubt. The order read that the identity of the accused persons was not established in the case.Another person was acquitted of criminal intimidation on June 4, 2018. Six were acquitted in FIR 362 on July 30, 2018. Five were acquitted on November 15, 2018, in a snatching case. On May 9, 2019, another five persons were acquitted.The most important FIR was number 345 of 2017, registered in Sector 5, in which 40 accused, including Insaan, were named and whose role is considered crucial in “planning and execution of riots”. However, the case is pending trial. Since outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020, trial as well as probe has got affected and there is almost no progress since.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/four-years-on-no-one-held-guilty-for-dera-violence-in-panchkula-101629833106386.html

A video clip of the alleged incident was recorded by a local and put online and has since been shared widely on social media. Even as BJP leaders have maintained that it was staged, the incident has invited criticism from opposition parties and farm leaders.Women members of both Aam Aadmi Party and Congress staged protests against the BJP, while farm leader Gurnam Singh Charuni had demanded immediate arrests of those involved.

In a first, the letters will be delivered digitally.Pradeep Kumar Agrawal, chief administrator, GMADA, said 1,600 acres of land was acquired in 11 villages for setting up Aerotropolis, an extension of Aerocity, in the vicinity of the international airport in Mohali. “Scrutiny of applications received from landowners who had applied for land pooling is going on and the entitlement of around 650-700 acres of land is almost ready,” he said. To ensure quick delivery of LoI, the landowners will get them through an SMS with a download link, said Agrawal. “It will also do away with the prevailing practice of manual dispatch, as earlier there had been instances where allottees complained of not receiving the LoI,” he said, adding that the process of online issuance of LoI will be adopted in all future schemes.GMADA has acquired land for the project in Bakarpur, Rurka, Safipur, Matran, Siaun, Manauli, Patton, Saini Majra, Chau Majra, Naraingarh and Chhat villages. The compensation ranges from ₹1.82 crore to ₹4 crore per acre.

Terming their operation a “big success”, police said the duo had been involved in the killings of several political workers, police personnel and civilians in the city. For the past several weeks, police had been pursuing several leads to track down Shiekh after getting inputs that he was operating from Srinagar and shuttling between central and South Kashmir.Shiekh was earlier a Hizbul Mujahideen militant, arrested and released twice. Later, he joined the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and was currently operating as the chief of TRF, a shadow front of LeT.Inspector general of police Vijay Kumar said, “A small team of police, comprising 10 members, was sent in covertly to raid a specific location in Alochibagh area. During the raid, the hiding militants were given an opportunity to surrender, however, they started firing on the police team. Our team also retaliated. In a brief shootout, two militants of LeT (TRF) got neutralised,” he said.Abbas Sheikh was resident of Kulgam district and his deputy, district commander, Saqib Manzoor hailed from Barzulla.“They were involved in the killing of several political workers, police personnel and civilians. Saqib Manzoor was involved in killing of advocate Babar Qadri last year.

25-08-2021||Chandigarh||Power privatisation: Chandigarh admn sends final bid report to MHA||After getting UT administrator VP Singh Badnore’s nod, the Chandigarh administration has sent the final bid report on privatisation of the electricity department to the ministry of home affairs (MHA).Now, the final note on the privatisation process will be submitted with the Union cabinet for its approval. After its consent, the department will be handed over to the private player. The administration has zeroed in on Eminent Electricity Distribution (EED), a whole-owned subsidiary of the RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group’s flagship Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation, to take over the department after it bid ₹871 crore against the reserve price of ₹175 crore.The bid was highest among those quoted by seven firms, which included Sterlite Power, ReNew Wing Energy, NTPC Electric Supply Company Limited, Adani Transmission Limited, Tata Power and Torrent Power.The decision to privatise the electricity department was taken on May 12, 2020, after directions from the Centre. The UT had committed to finish the process by the year end but it got entangled in legal battles after the UT Powermen Union approached the Punjab and Haryana high court against the move. The process was twice stayed by the high court. On May 28, HC had applied the brakes on privatisation, and even pulled up the administration for its “undue hurry” during a raging pandemic. Earlier, the HC had stayed the process on December 1.On both occasions the administration had approached the Supreme Court, which allowed the process to continue.The move has elicited criticism from different quarters, including employee’ unions, resident welfare associations and opposition parties. It was on a petition of the unions that the HC had stayed the process. However, with the Union government pushing for it, the administration has put it on fast track.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/power-privatisation-chandigarh-admn-sends-final-bid-report-to-mha-101629832386661.html
25-08-2021||Bangalore||State targets 500k jabs per day in Sept: CM||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Tuesday said that the state government is planning to administer 500,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses per day in September, reiterating the goal to vaccinate all eligible population by the end of the year. “Vaccination is the only solution for the future waves (of Covid). So, the more population we vaccinate the safer India is. Karnataka has been at the forefront in vaccination, we have got vaccination centres throughout the state and we are planning to vaccinate 500,000 every day in the month of September,” Bommai said.Vice president M Venkaiah Naidu and Karnataka governor Thaawarchand Gehlot were part of the ‘Vaccinate India Programme,’ which was an initiative of the department of planning and Give India Foundation. The statement comes at a time when Karnataka is staring at a threat of a third wave of Covid-19 infections even as the government continues to relax restrictions and even resume physical classes for school children. Karnataka has so far administered 3,79,01,502 doses of vaccines, according to data from CoWin till 8.20 pm on Tuesday. The first dose accounts for 2,89,27,640 doses while 89,73,862 second doses have been administered, as per CoWin data. Karnataka is ranging between 200,000 to 400,000 doses each day but shortage in vaccines outside Bengaluru has been a concern which Bommai said the government will overcome with the help of the union government. “The government of India has assured us all help and I am confident that they will give 15 million vaccines so that we can vaccinate 500,000 persons every day. If this is done for the next three to four months, probably 80% of our population will be vaccinated. That’s the target we are trying to achieve,” he added.Bommai, on Tuesday morning told reporters that he would be visiting Delhi on Wednesday to hold meetings with all Union ministers including health and seek better quota of vaccines. The CM said that he would change the dynamics of vaccination once availability of the same is assured. The Karnataka government has already reached out to high net worth individuals and large corporations to tap into their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds and help the state procure more vaccines, Hindustan Times reported on August 18. “We have set an ambitious target to fully inoculate the entire eligible adult population in the state by December. I will soon visit Delhi to seek an additional supply of vaccines to our state. The private sector can procure 25% of the vaccine production. We are having discussions with corporate companies to explore the possibilities of procuring vaccines under CSR and providing it to the state government. This will significantly accelerate the vaccination drive,” Sudhakar said in a statement on August 17. The Centre’s decision to control the distribution of Covid- 19 vaccine doses among all states has left Karnataka with a shortage of sorts to achieve its target of administering at least one dose to all eligible people by the end of the year, according to data. Bommai reiterated the government’s plea, asking more philanthropists to come forward and help increase the vaccination coverage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/state-targets-500k-jabs-per-day-in-sept-cm-101629832385159.html
25-08-2021||Bangalore||Forensic hair test confirm drug use by actors||In a first, Bengaluru police have used forensic analysis of human hair to confirm consumption of narcotic substances by two Kannada actors whose blood and urine sample tests to find drug traces were inconclusive, police officials said. This forensic technique was used in the investigation of the drug case involving two Kannada actors, Ragini Dwivedi and Sanjjana Galrani. In a statement released on Tuesday, Bengaluru police said that as the tests of urine and blood samples were not conclusive in this case, the Central Crime Branch (CCB) collected hair follicles from the actors and sent them to the Central Forensic Science Laboratory in Hyderabad in October 2020. “Generally, only blood or urine samples are sent to labs for tests. But these samples could only confirm whether drugs were consumed in the past 24 hours. So, we decided to send the hair samples to Hyderabad forensic lab,” said a senior CCB official. According to the police, the hair samples were sent along with those of nails and urine. “The hair samples were sent for the first time in a drugs case in the state,” said Sandeep Patil, joint commissioner of police (crime). The test is known as the hair follicle test or hair drug test. The lab had rejected the samples of hair of the actresses for the first time, so the samples were sent again, read a statement from the CCB. Following the Narcotics Control Bureau’s seizure of drugs in August 2020, Kannada film director Indrajit Lankesh claimed to have information on several film personalities who frequently used drugs at parties. On August 31 last year, the Central Crime Branch police questioned him for almost five hours and asked him to share whatever details he could to support the police in its fight against the drug menace. Lankesh claimed he had shared 15 names from the industry and some supporting documents. Based on these inputs, the Central Crime Branch of Bengaluru police and the NCB had arrested Dwivedi on September 14, 2020, and Sanjjanaa two days later. The actors had been arrested following an FIR registered in the Cottonpet police station under sections of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act dealing with illegal drug possession, consumption, and dealing. They were released on bail in January 2021. After interrogating more than 180 witnesses, the CCB filed a 2,400-page charge sheet against 25 persons, including Ragini and Sanjjanaa, in March this year. Patil said that since the accused in the case had evaded arrest, it was difficult to collect urine and other routine blood tests within 48 hours. “Hair samples will retain the traces of drugs for up to one year. The new method has helped the police to trace the drug consumption of the accused in NDPS cases,” Patil said. Apart from the two actresses, the reports have also confirmed that other accused in the case -- Viren Khanna, Rahul Tonse -- were using drugs. After the lab sent the reports, the investigation officer in the case has submitted them to the 33rd CCH court in Bengaluru. The reports will be added to the charge sheet against the actresses and others, the statement added. Talking to local media, Sanjjanaa Galrani has responded that she does not know about the CFSL report. She said she will answer only after obtaining the details of the CFSL report. Ragini and the other accused were not available for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/forensic-hair-test-confirm-drug-use-by-actors-101629832326584.html

This was done to minimize the risk of importing new Covid-19 variants. “However, the passengers arriving from Brazil and South Africa shall continue to provide the samples at Kempegowda international Airport / other entry airports and wait for the results in the airport. On testing negative they shall leave the airport,” according to the new orders. Karnataka has so far recorded several variants of the Covid-19 virus that has added to the challenges of the southern state which was among the worst impacted by the pandemic. The state has so far detected 155 cases of the Alpha / B.1.1.7 variant, 7 of the Beta / B.1.351, 1089 Delta / B.1.617.2 and 4 of the Delta plus / B.1.617.2.1(AY.1) variant, government data shows. The state has also detected 159 Kappa / B.1.617.1 variants and 1 ETA / B.1.525 variant. However, Karnataka has seen a marginal reduction in new infections but the threat of the third wave of infections looms large on the southern state. There were 1,259 new infections in a 24 -hour period, the state health department said in its daily bulletin on Tuesday. As the biggest city in Karnataka and among the largest urban centres in the country, Bengaluru attracts millions of arrivals from foreign shores each year. Despite the pandemic, Bengaluru airport has seen an uptick in arrivals in recent days and weeks. The state government said that it will continue to monitor these points of arrival closely. The state already has a rule that mandates negative RT-PCR tests from those coming from Kerala and Maharashtra, where there has been a resurgence of cases. “However, further actions shall be taken as per existing SoPs. The strict tele-monitoring of these passengers should be ensured. The above protocol shall be periodically reviewed according to the scenario of Covid-19 in the state,” the government said in its order on international passengers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/ktaka-relaxes-testing-rules-for-fliers-from-europe-west-asia-101629832325336.html
25-08-2021||Bangalore||Mysuru police bust fake RT-PCR test racket, 3 arrested||Mysuru police on Monday arrested two people for trying to enter Karnataka using fake RT-PCR reports. In the investigation that followed, one more person was arrested for preparing the fake report. Following the increase in Covid-19 cases in Kerala, the state government had imposed strict regulations for passengers coming from Maharashtra and Kerala, including mandatory RT-PCR test reports. The arrest took place based on an input that people were entering the state using fake test reports. A team of HD Kote Police began conducting checks at the Bavali check-post. During one such inspection, when the team checked the QR code on one of the reports, it was found to be fake. The two men -- Jabeer and Shariff – traveling using the fake reports were taken into custody. “Based on the information, we located the origin of the fake report to Vellamunda city, in Wayanad (in Kerala). We arrested Ranjit, who runs a tours and travels agency, and seized the computer and other equipment used to prepare the fake reports,” said HD Kote police official. Another accused, identified as Nishad, has gone absconding, and the police have launched a hunt to nab him. Jabber and Shariff were produced before a court, which remanded them to 14 days judicial custody .Meanwhile, BJP member of legislative council AH Vishwanath accused the personnel at Bavali check-post on the border of Karnataka and Kerala of taking money to allow people to enter from across the state without any RT-PCR negative report.Addressing a news conference on Sunday, he said that the personnel at the Bavali check-post are reportedly collecting money to allow people from the neighboring state without insisting on the negative reports. The MLC urged the government to close this border till the situation improves in Kerala. “Senior officers must make surprise visits to keep a tight vigil in the border. By intensifying checking at the border, the government must withdraw the weekend curfew imposed on Mysuru city from 9 pm on Friday up to 5 am on Monday in view of the low positivity rate. Traders are badly hit due to weekend curfew,” he added. Karnataka government’s decision to demand RT-PCR test had led to protest in Dakshina Kannada district and other parts of the state bordering Kerala. However, the government had insisted that considering the increase in Covid-19 cases in districts bordering Kerala, the rule can’t be withdrawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/mysuru-police-bust-fake-rt-pcr-test-racket-3-arrested-101629832264779.html

The booth-level officers will carry out house-to-house survey on the basis of electoral rolls to identify fully and partially vaccinated and unvaccinated population in their wards.“During the drive, all departments concerned have been asked to suspend other activities and focus on vaccination so that the aim is achieved,” said Dr Jindal.“In last three months, as many as 6,903 people were detected Covid-19 positive in Kangra. Of these, 6,412 were unvaccinated. Only 170 fully vaccinated people caught the infection, of whom three died,” said Dr Jindal.During the second wave, the hospitalisation rate was 13-14% which has come down to 3-4% after the vaccination drive was launched, he said.“Vaccine is safe and counter indications are only for people with severe allergic problems. People with co-morbidities must get the jab to reduced chances of mortality,” he said.Himachal logs 281 fresh casesWith 281 fresh Covid-19 cases reported on Tuesday, Himachal’s total case tally rose to 2,12,260 while the death toll mounted to 3,562 after four patients succumbed to the contagion.Of the new cases, 90 were reported in Mandi, 48 in Chamba, 45 in Shimla, 37 in Kangra, 20 in Kullu, 18 in Hamirpur, 10 in Lahaul-Spiti, seven in Bilaspur, three in Kinnaur, two in Una and one in Solan.

25-08-2021||Bangalore||Over ₹1k-cr project on anvil to help revive parched districts||The Karnataka government has proposed a ₹1,670-crore project to supply treated water from Vrishabhavathi river in Bengaluru to regions like Tumakuru, Nelamanagala, Chikballapur and Doddaballapur to help revive depleting water tables, in what appears to be the continuation of a policy to supply used water to surrounding areas of India’s IT capital. Karnataka’s minister for minor irrigation, law and parliamentary affairs JC Madhuswamy said the department has sent a detailed project report (DPR) to the government for its approval. While the river, which resembles a drain due to an unchecked inflow of sewage water and industrial pollutants, the new programme is meant to salvage the drain inlets by treating them and then pumping around 300 mld (million litres per day) to nearby regions outside Bengaluru. “Around 308 mld of secondary treated water will be used to fill up tanks in Chikballapur, Nelamangala, parts of Tumakuru and Doddaballapur,” a senior official at the state’s minor irrigation department told Hindustan Times. Successive governments in Karnataka have pursued a policy to prioritise Bengaluru’s water needs, depriving regions around it. Despite that Bengaluru faces water scarcity as most parts of the city are fed with tankers that are filled by overexploiting borewells, adversely impacting groundwater tables. The closest river to Bengaluru is over 100kms away, which has forced governments to spend thousands of crores to bring water for over 12 million residents of the city. According to estimates by the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru receives around 700-850 mm of rain each year, which is enough to accumulate around 16 tmc ft of water -- almost 70% of its demand of around 19 tmc ft. But lack of treatment plants and awareness has given rise to a situation in which most of the water is let out into drains by most households except large apartment complexes where it is mandatory to have sewage treatment plants. The Siddaramaiah-led Congress government had initiated the Koramangala and Challaghatta Valley (KC Valley) project to pump around 440 mld of secondary treated water to drought-prone Kolar and Chikkaballapur districts to fill up lakes and tanks. The treated water was pumped into Lakshmisagar lake in Narsapura of Kolar directly. The project had divided political groups and scientists who argued over the benefits and harms of such an exercise. TV Ramachandra, a scientist at the Centre for Ecological Sciences at IISc, said, “Such projects are good if we are ensuring the removal of heavy metals from water.” Ramachandra, who has authored several papers on water in Bengaluru, said the Vrishabhavathi belt has a concentration of industries that discharge heavy metals into the streams, which would enter the humans through any produce grown with this water. “We are so irresponsible as a regulatory body that we allow the industries to pollute the water bodies.” The official cited above said the water from Vrishbhavathi will be used only to fill tanks and not for agriculture or drinking water purposes. However, experts see a problem with such an approach that does not prioritise tertiary treatment of wastewater. The primary treatment removes large particles, chemical ions are removed in the secondary treatment and nutrients are removed in the tertiary treatment, experts said, pointing out the requirement to carry out all three processes to make the most of water. Pumping inadequately treated water into tanks for the purpose of rejuvenating groundwater tables is unlikely to have a desired effect, experts said. “Vegetables that are grown downstream and also the lake water have heavy metal contents. Those vegetables like pudina and spinach which we eat will naturally get into our body. Higher instances of heavy metals in our food items is also leading to the escalation in cancer and kidney failures in the region,” Ramchandra said. He said instances of kidney failure in Bengaluru, which was 1 in 100,000 about 12 years ago, is around 1 in 5,000 today. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body) has also prioritised aesthetics over quality of water in its lake rejuvenation projects, experts said. A report by CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) indicated that there are around 21 lakes out of the 205 existing on paper in which water was fit for drinking. This claim has been contested by environmentalists, scientists, and citizens. A report by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) in 2020 states that there is not even one lake which has water fit for drinking. But fish from these lakes are often consumed in Bengaluru as licences are auctioned to the highest bidder. In Bengaluru’s BTM Lake, people throng to buy fish like rohu (Labeo Rohita), catla (Labeo Catla) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio), among others, almost every weekend. Several citizen-initiative groups have aired concerns over such projects that focus on cosmetic beautification rather than improving the ecology of the spaces. A July 2021 research paper, ‘Heavy metal in the food chain -- Consequences of polluting water bodies, by TV Ramachandra and NR Narayan studied the concentration of heavy metal in Varthur lake, near the technology corridor of the city. “The study on heavy metal concentrations in vegetables grown near Varthur lake, Bangalore, has shown significant accumulation of heavy metals in vegetables that correlated well with its soil and lake water concentrations. The prolonged irrigation of vegetables using such contaminated lake water has led to soil contamination, which ultimately resulted in contamination of vegetables due to the uptake and accumulation of heavy metals in edible portions of vegetables. The heavy metal content in vegetables exceeded the safe limits in India,” the paper states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/over-1k-cr-project-on-anvil-to-help-revive-parched-districts-101629832204978.html

They have already suffered huge losses due to unseasonal rains and hailstorm this year. The prices they are fetching now are not even enough to cover the input costs.” The Congress president alleged that the government has given traders and commission agents a free hand in the “organised loot” of apple growers.He said the prices of apples should be decided through open bidding. Increased transportation and packaging costsRathore said bad roads in the apple belt were resulting in high transportation cost and further, the unprecedented increase in cost of fertilisers, pesticides and packaging material had dealt a severe blow to apple growers.Rathore alleged that despite the assurances given by horticulture minister Mahender Singh Thakur, the prices of packaging material, including cartons and trays, had increased manifold.The Congress chief demanded the state government procure apple crop through National Agriculture Cooperative Marketing Federation (NAFED) on the lines of Jammu and Kashmir. He demanded that the government also fix a minimum support price (MSP) for table fruit and good quality apples. For this, he demanded, that the HPMC should increase the number of procurement centres so that the growers can be saved from financial loss.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rathore-slams-jai-ram-govt-for-neglecting-apple-growers-101629832084841.html

The PAC, in addition to a member of the urban planning department, also has officials from other departments, whose nod is required too. After its approval, the requisite environment approvals will also be taken,” said a CHB official. The drawings for PAC’s approval were submitted in January this year.The UT environment department had earlier returned the CHB application for environment clearance and had asked it to resubmit it with proper documentation. A senior CHB official said: “The environment department has asked us to submit approved drawings of the project and proof of application for wildlife clearance.”Also, an application for providing authenticated drawings depicting the distance of project site form wildlife sanctuaries and city bird sanctuary was submitted to the chief wildlife warden in June this year. It is also under scrutiny.UT ADVISER VISITS PROJECT SITEUT adviser Dharam Pal, who is also the CHB chairman, on Tuesday visited the project site. The general housing scheme is planned on the IT Park’s plots 1 and 2, which are spread over 16.6 acres. It will comprise 728 dwelling units. The CHB is also planning to construct flats on behalf of the Punjab and Haryana governments for their MLAs and officers. During the visit, Pal went through the layout plan of the 123-acre land and asked the officials concerned to sort out all issues in both the schemes and start the construction at the earliest. He also directed that the vacant plots for commercial activities, hospital and hotel at the project sire be put on auction after fixing their reserve prices.The adviser also inspected vacant commercial properties at Manimajra and Kajheri in Sector 61.

25-08-2021||Chandigarh||Captain Amarinder Singh, Navjot Sidhu aides spar as Punjab crisis deepens||The Congress government in Punjab was thrown into fresh turmoil on Tuesday as ministers close to state unit chief Navjot Singh Sidhu rebelled against chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, and leaders loyal to the latter demanded the ouster of Sidhu’s advisers over their controversial remarks.The factional fight appeared to end an uneasy truce between Sidhu and Singh brokered by the Congress leadership after months of tense negotiations and mirrored a similar tussle for control of the party that broke out in May. Punjab goes to the polls early next year.Four cabinet ministers and around two dozen MLAs declared they didn’t have faith in the CM’s ability to fulfil pending poll promises but stopped short of demanding his resignation.“We have lost faith in him (Singh), but changing the CM is the prerogative of the party high command,” said minister for jails and cooperation Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa after meeting the lawmakers at rural development minister Tript Rajinder Bajwa’s official residence in Chandigarh.The meeting was attended by technical education minister Charanjit Singh Channi, water resources minister Sukhbinder Sarkaria, Punjab Congress general secretary (organisation) Pargat Singh, and around two dozen legislators.The disgruntled leaders also authorised a five-member delegation — four cabinet ministers and Pargat Singh, all known detractors of Singh — to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi and apprise her of their sentiment at the earliest.The disgruntled ministers also spoke to All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat. They will travel to Dehradun on Wednesday to meet Rawat before heading to Delhi.Sidhu was not present at the meeting but the leaders said they will discuss the matter with him before leaving for Delhi. The Congress has 80 MLAs in Punjab.Channi told reporters that the MLAs who assembled in Chandigarh were worried about unfulfilled poll promises made by the Congress before the 2017 assembly elections. “A lot of promises have been fulfilled, but those promises (the implementation of) which may lead to friction with the opposition remain unfulfilled,” he said.He said that issues were not getting resolved the way the Congress wanted. “We no longer trust that these issues will be resolved. Therefore, we are seeking time from the party high command for a meeting, and we will meet them and put forth our issues so that Punjab’s issues can be resolved,” said Channi, flanked by Randhawa, Bajwa and Pargat SIngh.Sidhu later met some of these ministers and MLAs at the party’s state headquarters here. “Got a call from Tripat Bajwa ji asking for an emergency…Met him along with other colleagues at the PPCC office. Will appraise the high command of the situation (sic),” he tweeted after meeting them.Hours later, Singh and his loyalists hit back, demanding action against two advisors of Sidhu, Malvinder Singh Mali and Pyare Lal Garg, who stirred a row on Sunday with their controversial comments on Kashmir.Five cabinet ministers and one MLA close to Singh called for strong action against Mali and Garg for their “patently anti-national and pro-Pak comments”.“The statements of both these newly appointed advisers of Punjab Congress president Navjot Sidhu were clearly against India’s interests, and detrimental to national security,” said cabinet ministers Brahm Mohindra, Vijay Inder Singla, Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Balbir Singh Sidhu and Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, along with MLA Raj Kumar Verka in a statement.Tuesday’s bitter verbal war is a throwback to a crisis that engulfed the Congress in May, when Sidhu rallied Singh’s detractors and publicly accused the CM of enabling corruption. Tensions between 79-year-old Singh and Sidhu had simmered since the latter quit the state cabinet after the chief minister changed his portfolio in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/captain-amarinder-singh-navjot-sidhu-aides-spar-as-punjab-crisis-deepens-101629831743058.html

Identified as Ashu Ram, 36, he belongs to Barnala. He will be produced in court on Wednesday. During preliminary questioning, Ashu reportedly told police that he lost control of the vehicle after a child beggar suddenly stepped in front of it. He also claimed that he was rushing a heart patient and an attendant to the PGIMER and was constantly blowing the siren to clear the road amid traffic. However, after he had fled from the spot leaving the ambulance behind, no one was found inside.According to witnesses, the private ambulance came from the Zirakpur side in speed and first hit a stationary autorickshaw that was waiting for the green signal around 10am. It then hit another auto and three scooters and brushed past a car in an attempt to flee. One of the scooterists was killed in the mishap.A case has been registered under Section 304 (punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 279 (rash driving) and 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code at the police station in Sector 34. Another driver held for smuggling liquor in ambulanceAn ambulance driver was caught smuggling liquor after he was involved in an accident in Sector 32 on Monday night. This was second accident involving an ambulance in the city on Monday. The accused has been identified as Rajan Kumar, 26, of Zirakpur. He was driving an ambulance of the National Highway Authority of India that operates on the Sangrur-Patiala stretch. According to police, the ambulance was returning after dropping a patient at the PGIMER. On the way, Rajan allegedly bought three boxes of countrymade liquor that he intended to sell at higher prices in Punjab.As he was heading towards Tribune Chowk, he suddenly lost control of the vehicle, which overturned after hitting an auto-rickshaw and a motorcycle. A woman passenger in the auto received minor injuries. On reaching the spot, police found liquor boxes in the ambulance. Rajan’s medical examination was conducted, but he was not found under the influence of liquor, said an investigating official. A case under the Excise Act was registered, and the driver was released on bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-accident-ambulance-driver-who-left-one-dead-six-injured-held-101629831668009.html

Yesterday, the standing committee discussed the matter for six hours and today as well, the matter was deliberated upon for two hours,” said Arun Kumar Attree, member of the standing committee for AC members. At least 16 elected AC members recorded their dissented.AC member Mithuraj Dhusiya said the decision to implement the agenda was unfortunate. “It is extremely unfortunate that no substantial discussion was allowed on the matter of FYUP with MEES or on other agenda items. No voting was allowed and the elected members were asked to deposit dissent notes,” he said.In 2014, DU was rocked by controversy after the then administration introduced the four-year undergraduate programme (FYUP), which was later scrapped by the government amid protests by students and teachers. Under MEES, students who exit successfully at the first year will be awarded a certificate, and a diploma if they exit after the second year, and such students can rejoin the programme later on.ABC allows students to exit from one course at any point and save their academic credits to use it in other universities. The credit transfer will only be possible within universities that sign up for the ABC system.The AC meeting also discusses other issues related to ad-hoc teachers, pending promotions, and delay in disbursal of grants to Delhi government-funded colleges.During zero hour, prior to the NEP discussion, members raised several demands. The elected teacher representatives of the AC from the teachers’ group, Democratic Teachers Front (DTF), asked DU to intervene in a matter related to repeated non-renewal of contracts of ad-hoc teachers, due to issues in the teaching roster, at Vivekananda College. “The issue of roster needs to be resolved so that teachers are not harassed,” said a statement signed by Rajesh Kumar, Biswajit Mohanty, and Mithuraaj Dhusiya, asking for the removal of the college’s acting principal.Teachers also demanded an intervention into the recent case where a Dalit Hindi teacher was allegedly slapped during a department meeting at Lakshmibai college. “Such incidents are extremely condemnable and violence has no place in education institutions. The principal has so far not been able to resolve this situation, which is unfortunate,” the teachers stated.Several AC members also asked the university to hold dialogues with the University Grants Commission (UGC) to delay the implementation of 2018 order which calls for a mandatory PhD qualification to be eligible to teach in university departments. They also asked for absorption of all ad-hoc teachers and giving them benefits like maternity leave.“DU must also facilitate immediate relief for teaching and non-teaching staff of 12 DU colleges that are 100% funded by the Delhi government. To give relief on a long-term basis, DU must explore options to make proposals for the takeover of these 12 colleges by Delhi University,” the teachers stated.Apart from this, the AC members asked the university administration to finish the pay fixation work immediately to smoothen problems of promotions in some colleges. “Immediately financial relief should be provided to dependents of all working teachers who expired because of Covid,” they said in the statement.Meanwhile, the DU Teachers’ Association (DUTA) also held a one-day strike outside the vice-chancellor’s office on Tuesday to protest against the NEP recommendations.The teachers’ body has asked for wider consultations over the recommendations before placing them in statutory bodies like AC.During the meeting of the Standing Committee on Academic Matters on Monday, several AC members raised their voices against the “loss of workload” that may arise due to the proposed NEP structure.“This document at this stage is not fit for discussion in Academic Council and needs a major overhaul and that is possible only when it is sent for feedback from teachers in committee of courses and staff councils,” said AC member Dhusiya. They also said that before implementing FYUP, the university needs to assess if they have the necessary infrastructure to accommodate students for a longer period.The teachers argued that due to the design of MEES and ABC students can earn credits for non-core courses from other universities thereby reducing the workload.Teachers also said that without giving much clarity on the job prospects for those who leave the institution with a certificate or diploma after their first or second year of the UG programme respectively, the MEES system will encourage more dropouts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fouryear-undergrad-multiple-entry-exit-credit-system-get-du-academic-council-approval-101629831666850.html
25-08-2021||Delhi||Man shot dead at Dwarka restaurant, hunt on for two assailants||An 18-year-old man was shot dead while working at a restaurant in Dwarka’s Chhawla area on Monday evening. The two men, who allegedly shot him at the entrance of the restaurant, are on the run and efforts are on to arrest them, police said.A senior police officer identified the victim by his first name Aman, a resident of Bawana area. Police said Monday was his first day at the restaurant as he was filling in for his friend, Mahesh (single name), who had gone to his village for Rakshabandhan.Police said the control room was alerted by a man named Vikas Yadav, whose brother owns the restaurant, ‘Heaven On Earth’. Describing the sequence of events, Yadav said he was sitting outside the restaurant when two men went in and placed an order for fried rice and momos.“After sitting inside for some time, the men came out and started pacing about. They got a call and as soon as it ended, they rushed inside. As they were entering, Aman was walking out with their order and they shot him four times. Two bullets missed him, but two hit him in the chest and leg, and left him bleeding profusely,” said Yadav.Yadav said his brother rushed Aman to a hospital, but doctors declared him dead on arrival. “I had made the PCR call and when the police arrived, I told them that my brother had taken Aman to Rao Tula Ram hospital,” he said.Police said when they reached the hospital, they were told that Aman was dead. A case was registered at the Chhawla police station under sections 302 (murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Arms Act.Police said the two men who shot Aman fled on their motorcycle parked nearby and police are scanning the CCTV footage to identify and nab them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-shot-dead-at-dwarka-restaurant-hunt-on-for-two-assailants-101629831666352.html
25-08-2021||Delhi||No more curbs on operational hours, restaurants, markets hope to recoup losses||Tuesday was like a normal Friday come early for restaurants, bars and market associations across the city; for the first time since April, these establishments could remain open for their usual business hours, instead of the truncated operating hours that were in place in view of Covid-19.Aiming to recover the losses sustained during the multiple lockdowns and restrictions, many associated with the hospitality sector said they hope to see their businesses returning to normal over the coming days.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), in an order on August 23, lifted the restrictions on timings of restaurants, bars, markets and malls, allowing them to operate for their full business hours. However, restaurants are still allowed to take in only 50% of their capacity.The Delhi government had imposed a complete lockdown on April 19, when Covid-19 cases had started to peak amid the second wave of the pandemic. From May-end, as the number of infections started reducing, the government started opening up public places in a staggered manner. From June 14, markets were allowed to open daily but only till 8pm. Restaurants were allowed to function at 50% capacity but only till 10pm.Markets in Delhi are normally allowed to open till 9.30pm, while restaurants and bars are allowed to remain open till 1am. A new policy of the Delhi government, allowing these outlets to open till 3am, is likely to come into effect from October.Restaurateurs said they had been waiting for this day for a long time, as the restricted hours was curtailing their revenue flow — at least 60% to 70% of their business usually came after 10pm.“We have been waiting for this day. The time cap was impacting our business. Most bar-related businesses made around 60% to 70% of their total revenue after 10pm. Since Tuesday is a weekday, business has been slow, but we hope to see it picking up over the coming weekend,” said Priyank Sukhija, founder and managing director, First Fiddle F&B Private Ltd.He said owing to the restricted hours, the staff strength was also reduced by about 30% and most employees took a salary cut, as profit margins had reduced. “From Tuesday, we plan to work at 100% staff strength. Salaries, too will be restored by the month-end,” said Sukhija.Welcoming the move, Kabir Suri, vice-president, National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), said restoring full working hours spells big relief for the food and beverages industry. “The restricted timings affected the dinner service. We had to take the last order at 9pm, which meant guests had to hurry up with their dinner and leave the premises. We lost a major window for business. Now , things will be more relaxed and we can also space out guests in two slots,” said Suri.Restaurant owners and market associations also said so far, the curtailed timings had not allowed the recovery of losses suffered during the lockdown periods.Ashwani Marwah, general secretary, traders’ association, Lajpat Nagar, said, “One, it would make operations more relaxed, the way it used to be. Shop owners wouldn’t have to worry about winding up in a hurry. This one hour slot would give everyone a breather and allow the crowd to be more scattered than concentrated.”He further said the market’s usual timing is 11am to 9pm. During the restricted timings, shops would open up early but customers would pour in only after 11am.“With the original timings being restored, we hope that business picks up. Most shoppers visit markets after office hours, especially during this time when the heat and humidity are at a peak. We lost business on festivals such as Rakshabandhan as well. The market will most likely revive over the weekend,” said Ashok Randhawa, president, Sarojini Nagar Mini Market Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-more-curbs-on-operational-hours-restaurants-and-markets-hope-to-recoup-losses-101629831665775.html
25-08-2021||Delhi||Seeking restrictions on drinking age akin to living in ivory tower: Delhi govt||The Delhi government on Tuesday told the high court that when the age of voting in the country is 18 years, seeking restrictions on the legal age for drinking is like living in an agony tower.“Nobody in the right mind supports drunken driving. Today the voting age for voting is 18 and to suggest that people above 18 cannot drink is to live in an ivory tower. Most states around Delhi have 18 (as the legal drinking age)…It does not mean that if you permit people above 18, you will allow drunken driving. There is an element of emotionality in this. Also there are very strict laws to check drunken driving,” senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing the Delhi government, said.The submissions were made before a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh during hearing on a plea that sought a robust mechanism for mandatory age check at liquor shops, bars and restaurants serving alcohol with government documents such as the Aadhaar card or the voter ID card.The petition also sought to restrain the Delhi government from giving effect to the new Excise Policy 2021-22 which reduced the age of consuming alcohol from 25 to 21 years until a robust age verification mechanism is put in place.Delhi was one of only six states or union territories that pegged the benchmark at 25. An expert committee set up by the government recommended in December that the legal drinking age be changed to 21.Announcing the new legal drinking age in March, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said that the government will introduce the system of “age-gating” in the city wherein persons below 21 years will not be allowed to enter any restaurant, pub or club that serves liquor by themselves. The change in rules is part of the new Delhi excise policy which aims to reform the city’s liquor business by improving user experience, cleaning up the liquor mafia and eradicating pilferage.On August 9, the Delhi government told the high court that the decision to reduce the legal drinking age was taken to have parity with other states, especially neighbouring cities such as Noida and Ghaziabad.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, also for the Delhi government, told the court on Tuesday that people are trying to stall the new excise policy for one reason or another. He said drunken driving is not permissible under the law and the reduction in the age cannot be connected to it.The court, while issuing notice on the plea by Community Against Drunken Driving (CADD), sought the response of the Delhi government.The organisation, through activist Prince Singhal, has sought mandatory age checks at places selling and serving alcohol including bars, pubs, liquor vends and any food and beverage outlet.“Since the Delhi government introduced the new excise policy and liberalised the alcohol policy bringing down the legal drinking age and increasing alcohol availability making the alcohol policy almost at par with countries in the west, it has become even more pertinent to strictly monitor age of consumer as is done in the western nations,” the petitioner said .It also sought that the Delhi government be restrained from giving effect to the recent amendment made in the Excise Rules which permit the door step delivery of liquor until a robust age verification mechanism is instituted even for door delivery.The matter will now be heard on September 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/seeking-restrictions-on-drinking-age-akin-to-living-in-ivory-tower-delhi-govt-101629831664172.html
25-08-2021||Delhi||Woman who immolated self near Supreme Court, dies||Three days after a 27-year-old man succumbed to burn injuries at the RML hospital, a 24-year-old woman, who set herself on fire along with the man outside the Supreme Court on August 16 over alleged harassment related to a rape complaint she filed against an MP, too died at the hospital on Tuesday morning.The woman, a resident of eastern Uttar Pradesh, was on ventilator support after sustaining 80% burn injuries in the incident. The man had 70% burns on his body.The police said that on May 1, 2019, the woman filed a rape case against Bahujan Samaj Party MP from Ghosi, Atul Rai, at the Lanka police station in Varanasi. After the MP’s anticipatory bail was rejected by the Supreme Court the same month, he surrendered in a Varanasi court in June 2019. He is currently in jail.On the afternoon of August 16, the man and woman, both from Uttar Pradesh, held a Facebook Live session from outside gate D of the Supreme Court before pouring kerosene and setting themselves on fire. In the video, the woman had accused at least five senior Uttar Pradesh police officers of harassing her to save the MP in the case she filed against him. In the 10-minute-long video, she said she was also being framed in a false case.In her complaint to the police, the woman alleged that Rai called her to his house to meet his wife on March 5, 2019, but she claimed he allegedly forced himself on her when she reached there. She also accused the MP of recording the act and allegedly using it to blackmail and threaten her against approaching police.Last week, after reports of the couple’s self-immolation, the Uttar Pradesh (UP) police had said that Rai was arrested on the woman’s complaint and a charge sheet was also filed against him. They also suspended two policemen, Varanasi Cantt SHO Rakesh Singh and sub-inspector Girija Shankar Yadav, and initiated departmental action against them for deficiencies in another case which the woman had alleged was filed to harass her.On August 17, the Uttar Pradesh government had formed a two-member team headed by a DG rank officer to probe all the FIRs pertaining to the alleged rape survivor and her male associate.The state government has also asked the two-member team to investigate allegations levelled by the woman against DG Uttar Pradesh Police Recruitment & Promotion Board (UPPRPB), RK Vishwakarma, and additional director general Neera Rawat in the video, and submit a report within two weeks.A senior Delhi Police officer, who asked not to be named, said, “ We are exploring the legal aspects of the case. The Uttar Pradesh police is already investigating her FIR. They had also gone to the hospital last week but were unable to record her statement. If need be, we will write to Facebook and use the video to file an FIR.”Police said they are in touch with the woman’s mother. Delhi Police are yet to receive a complaint related to the self-immolation incident outside the country’s apex court.When contacted, the woman’s mother did not comment on the incident.The investigation so far has revealed that the two knew each other for the past 7-8 years and were active in politics from their student years.Locals in the 27-year-old man’s village in Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh, said that he was a witness in the case against Rai.According to police, Rai’s brother, Pawan Kumar, had filed a case against the 24-year-old woman in November 2020 at the Cantonment police station in Varanasi, accusing her of forging documents to alter her date of birth, following which a local court in Varanasi had issued a non-bailable warrant against her earlier this month.Kumar had complained in a 2015 complaint the woman filed against a student leader, she submitted documents in which her date of birth was March 10, 1997, and in the subsequent complaint against his brother in 2019, the woman said her date of birth was June 10, 1997.When HT contacted him for a response on Tuesday after reports of the woman’s death, he said, “The case is sub judice. It will not be appropriate to comment.”Earlier this year, the woman had approached the Supreme Court seeking a transfer of the case against Rai from Uttar Pradesh to a Delhi court. The Supreme Court had on March 9 stayed the trial and issued a notice to the jailed MP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/woman-who-immolated-self-near-sc-dies-101629831604723.html
25-08-2021||Delhi||High pollution levels can alter rainfall patterns, Delhi-NCR at risk: Analysis||High pollution levels not only pose a health risk to people but over time, it can also reduce the southwest monsoon rainfall by around 10-15% in the country, a new analysis has found.A recent analysis by Climate Trends, a Delhi based communications initiative building a narrative around climate ambition and low carbon development pathways, highlighted how high pollution levels impacted monsoon patterns in a region. The analysis said with the levels of toxic pollution increasing, in the coming years, monsoon rain may reduce by at least 10%.“Air pollution is likely to decrease the southwest monsoon rainfall by 10%-15% for the entire country. Meanwhile, some places might even see rain drop up to 50%. It will also impact the dynamics of monsoon like cause a delay in onset,” said Dilip Ganguly, associate professor, Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT-Delhi, who is one of the contributors to the analysis.Explaining the reason, he said, “Air pollution does not allow the landmass to warm up to the required levels. Due to the presence of pollutants, heating of land takes place at a slower rate. For instance, the required surface temperature is 40°C, while the presence of air pollution will result in restricting temperature up to 38°C or 39°C.”Signs of erratic monsoon patterns are already visible in Delhi and the neighbouring areas.Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and private weather forecasters said that over the last decade, instead of receiving uniform rains, Delhi has been receiving short and intense rainfall. The number of rainy days has also reduced from around 15-17 between the years 2000 and 2009, to around 10-12 over the last 10 years.This year, Delhi saw only five rainy days in August. But in these five days, the city received 214.5 mm rainfall, a 3% surplus, the bulk of which was concentrated on August 21.The report also reiterated what Delhi is witnessing. The findings said that “although air pollution is impacting mean monsoon rainfall for India, it is the Indo-Gangetic plains which seem to be in a tight spot.”“...From March-May, the land surface gets heated due to which the strength of the inversion layer reduces, bringing down the pollution levels. However, during that time, dust from western Rajasthan and the adjoining desert region of Pakistan reaches the Indo-Gangetic plains. This along with local emissions leads to an increase in summer time pollution,” said Krishnan Raghavan, scientist, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, and lead author on IPCC working group-one report.He said, “The geography of the north-western plains including Delhi-NCR is also not supportive. The entire Himalayan region guards the Indo-Gangetic plains, which does not allow pollutants to escape and acts as a barrier.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/high-pollution-levels-can-alter-rainfall-patterns-delhi-ncr-at-high-risk-analysis-101629831604175.html
25-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi drains to be redesigned for lasting relief from waterlogging: Kejriwal||The design of city drains will be changed according to the suggestions by an expert team from IIT-Delhi to ensure smooth flow of water during and after heavy rains and resolve the annual problem of waterlogging on roads during monsoons, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Tuesday after chairing a review meeting on Delhi Drainage Masterplan.“Today CM Arvind Kejriwal chaired a review meeting on Delhi’s drainage masterplan. Design changes will be introduced in drains in accordance with recommendations of IIT. The focus will be to enable smooth flow of water during and after heavy rains. Waterlogging issues be resolved,” said a tweet from the CM’s office after the review meeting.According to the tweet by the CMO, Delhi, the review meeting was also attended by water minister Satyandar Jain, vice-chairperson of Delhi Jal Board Raghav Chadha and chief secretary Vijay Dev.The meeting came at a time when the national capital was once again brought to its knees after six hours of rainfall on Saturday, throwing traffic into disarray and inundating several key stretches and underpasses. The heavy flooding exposed how badly city needs a comprehensive drainage plan, as well a meticulous road map to ensure that local drains are cleaned properly ahead of monsoon that are managed by a multitude of agencies.On July 19, Kejriwal announced that the Delhi administration will redesign the city’s drainage system and identify more waterlogging hot spots so that area-specific interventions can be made to ensure smooth flow of traffic and people’s safety. The announcement by the chief minister came on a day when a man drowned in the submerged Pul Prahladpur underpass -- one of the perennial problem points -- and at least 39 key road stretches were flooded after heavy rain.The last drainage master plan was drafted by the Delhi administration in 1976. To be sure, Delhi was administered by a metropolitan council between 1966 and 1990. In 2016, the Delhi government commissioned a study of the city’s drainage system by IIT-Delhi. Following the study, a drainage master plan was compiled which had also pointed out to the fact that the city had no single agency to manage and maintain drainage. However, the plan could not be implemented.A senior government official abreast of the developments, said, “There are about 2,846 drains in Delhi with a total length of 3,692 km. Majority of these drains are managed by the Public Works Department (PWD). Delhi is divided into three major natural drainage basins -- Trans Yamuna, Barapullah and Najafgarh. In addition, there are also several small drainage basins connected directly to the Yamuna.”According to a statement by the CM office, the government will rope in consultants to identify and plug the problems in the drainage system. To bolster the drainage system, specific projects will be taken up to implement solutions for fixing slopes of drains, connecting storm drains to the larger drainage system, etc.The statement said that a technical expert committee has been working to decide design parameters and technical inputs like rainfall intensity, return period, run-off coefficient and retention period for the drainage master plan. The experts from IIT-Delhi have been roped in to analyse the drainage systems and suggest solutions.The two panel of experts have given 10 recommendations to the government. These range from removing encroachments on storm water drains to curb drumping of waste and sewage in stormwater drains, preventing construction on drains, rejuvenation of water bodies and designing drains from a broader perspective of the area covered by them, instead of just fixing the local concerns. The panel has also recommended improving flood monitoring and management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/city-drains-to-be-redesigned-for-lasting-relief-from-waterlogging-kejriwal-101629831544736.html
25-08-2021||Delhi||AAP to launch a month-long campaign ahead of municipal polls||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will kick-start a campaign aimed at the Delhi municipal polls next year involving local meetings and door-to-door drives from September 1 to 30, highlighting alleged corruption in the three BJP-ruled municipal corporations (MCD), and their failures in keeping Delhi clean, said AAP Delhi convener Gopal Rai.“The Aam Aadmi Party will launch a mega campaign from 1st September to 30th September to make the MCDs free of garbage and corruption. As part of the campaign, nearly 2,500 meetings will be conducted with local residents under the ‘Aapka Vidhayak Aapke Dwaar’ initiative. AAP MLAs will lead the campaign with full force,” said Rai, also a minister in the Kejriwal cabinet, at a press conference on Tuesday.He said, “Ward-wise preparation meetings will be held in all 272 wards of Delhi from 25 to 30 August under the ‘Aapka Vidhayak Aapke Dwaar’ initiative. The people of Delhi continuously gave the BJP chance in the MCD, and in return, the BJP councillors gave garbage and corruption to the people.”“With the support of the people, AAP will bring change in the MCD in the same way it brought change to Delhi (government). The BJP got zero seats in the MCD by-polls earlier this year. They will see the same result in the forthcoming MCD elections,” Rai added.In the bypolls to five municipal wards in February this year, the AAP won four and the Congress got one seat. The BJP drew a blank.Delhi goes to the municipal polls next year.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “Like all political parties, the Aam Aadmi Party is free to run its political agenda before the municipal polls but the truth is that the AAP has no interest in improving civic services, it just wants to grab power in the civic bodies.”“It is sad that the AAP has chosen to play dirty politics against municipal corporations at a time when Delhi gets inundated for days after short spells of rains, the water supply and sewage services have almost collapsed due to corruption in the jal board, and today even the Delhi High Court has sought response from the Delhi Jal Board on its accounts balance sheets since 2015. The Delhi government is today answerable to the people on charges of corruption in the DTC bus purchase and scams in the jal board. To divert public attention from these serious allegations, the AAP is trying to mislead people by levelling baseless allegations against the municipal corporations. Mr Gopal Rai is a minister in the Delhi government, and if he really wishes to improve civic services he should shed political bias and make his Delhi government release long withheld municipal funds,” Kapoor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-to-launch-a-month-long-campaign-ahead-of-municipal-polls-101629831544122.html
25-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Stray dog issue pitting neighbour against neighbour||The stray dog issue has polarised various neighbourhoods in Chandigarh. A recent case in Sector 8 has once again put the spotlight on this rift between dog lovers who want to feed and care for the strays and those who want an end to the “nuisance” caused by them.Rajbir Rai, the Sector 8 resident who was issued a show-cause notice on his neighbours’ complaint for allegedly keeping around a dozen stray dogs, calls it a “problem between neighbours” in which stray dogs have been made the scapegoat. “I care for the strays and feed them. There has been no instance of dog bites due to them,” he says, while alleging that he had earlier filed a complaint of animal abuse against a neighbour that led to the whole episode.In Sector 22, a woman unwilling to be named, shares how she had rescued a stray dog in February that later gave birth to nine puppies and led to a dispute with her neighbours. “My neighbours even tried to abandon the puppies in a forest area,” she says. In Sector 37, Sameer Gupta, who lives in a corner house next to the park, is among those who have to deal with the stray dog issue on a daily basis. “Some animal lovers have made kennels in the park, which often leads to conflicts. As the kennels were made illegally, I had written to the civic body and got them removed in January. The very next day the other group threatened me and rebuilt the kennels,” he says. A civic body official, who deals with this issue, says on the condition of anonymity: “If the neighbours keep sending us complaints, we have to take action. We often ask people who want to take care of such stray dogs to simply adopt them.”However, the Chandigarh Registration of Pet Dogs Bylaws allows a family to keep only two pets. A couple of years back there was a proposal to allow a family to adopt two additional stray dogs, but it was not implemented. District animal welfare officer Inder Sandhu says that “de-escalation” is the key here, and the problem would not arise if the civic body does its job properly. According to Sandhu, there have been many instances where the anger towards dogs was found to be misplaced, and after his intervention, some people had even taken back their complaints.In March this year, the Animal Welfare Board of India had issued an advisory to all chief secretaries, police departments and civic bodies on handling of such issues. According to it, resident welfare associations and dog feeders should identify feeding spots in the respective neighbourhoods. It also suggests that the station house officer concerned should be made responsible for ensuring that the feeders and other residents don’t cause any kind of harassment to each other.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhstray-dog-issue-pitting-neighbour-against-neighbour-101629831485855.html
25-08-2021||Lucknow||Lucknow SGPGI to substantially increase emergency admissions soon||To accommodate more emergency cases at the Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), the emergency wing will soon be shifted to the organ transplant centre. The organ transplant centre has 510 beds out of which 110 would be used for the new emergency ward, a substantial increase from the existing 30 beds, SGPGIMS officials said. “Once the emergency wing has more beds, we would be able to accommodate more emergency patients many of whom have to be refused admission as our emergency admission capacity is limited at present,” said director SGPGIMS professor Radha Krishna Dhiman. The remaining section of the organ transplant centre would be used to perform liver transplants, SGPGIMS officials said. The doctors of the institute perform around 120 kidney transplants annually. Minister of health education Suresh Khanna during the Annual Conference of Indian Society of Nephrology at SGPGIMS’s Shruti Auditorium had directed the PGI authorities to increase emergency admission. “We will ensure that patient care at SGPGIMS is improved. The increase in the number of beds will surely improve patient care in the days to come,” professor Dhiman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-sgpgi-to-substantially-increase-emergency-admissions-soon-101629831484728.html
25-08-2021||Mumbai||Took 2 vax doses, certificates show jabbed once: Couple in Maharashtra||A couple from Badlapur who took both their doses of Covid-19 vaccine have complained that their vaccination certificates mention only one dose completed. As a result, they claimed they were deprived of travelling by local trains.The couple, Razia Khurshid husen Shaikh, 65, and Khurshidhusen Abdulla Shaikh, 65, who got their first dose of Covishield on March 24 in a private hospital in Thane, took their second dose at Kulgaon Badlapur Municipal Council’s (KBMC) Dubey Hospital on May 20. However, after the second dose, they received a certificate that showed their second dose of vaccine as the first dose.“Now, I have two certificates that show first dose of vaccination. I have been visiting the civic hospital to update it since May. However, they have not done anything about it. Now, since one can travel in local trains after full vaccination, we are deprived of this even after taking our full dose,” said Shaikh. “I want to travel by train to my daughter’s place in Mulund. Taking the road is a nightmare now-a-days due to the traffic situation. One day, it took four hours from Badlapur to Mulund,” said Shaikh.The couple had approached the KBMC to make the correction on the CoWIN app and help them update the certificate. The KBMC staff had made the correction on the receipt provided to the couple. However, the same is not updated on the app yet.“When I went to take the second dose, the staff there did not even bother to ask me about my first dose. They simply filled the form. It was very crowded too. It is not convenient for us to keep visiting the hospital to get this issue resolved,” added Shaikh, who is a retired person. Chief officer of KBMC, Yogesh Ghodase, said, “I will look into this matter and help it get solved after checking with my staff.”In Badlapur, there are three civic-run vaccination centres – Dubey Hospital, a rural hospital and a primary health centre in Badlapur gaon. Badlapur residents complained about lack of vaccines in the civic-run hospitals and had to go to other cities to get vaccinated. Some also complained about mismanagement at the centres.“When I went for the second dose on Monday afternoon, they said there is no stock available. I thought of waiting to see if there was a chance, and after some time, an employee came and allowed everyone in for the dose” said Sudha Nambiar, 56.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/took-2-vax-doses-certificates-show-jabbed-once-couple-in-maharashtra-101629831304706.html
25-08-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali: NHAI’s ₹700-cr project hits roadblock||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI)’s ambitious project to build a greenfield alignment to decongest the Airport Road in Mohali besides Chandigarh and Zirakpur has hit a hurdle.Even though the authority has released ₹450 crore to acquire 400 acres of land to construct the 32-kilometre road, affected landowners in Nagiari, Devi Nagar and other villages have raised objections to the compensation being provided for acquisition. The amount ranges from ₹24 lakh to ₹4.12 crore per acre depending upon the location.A greenfield road is built in an area that has never been developed. The planned road from IT Chowk near the Chandigarh International Airport to the Kurali-Chandigarh road will provide an alternative route to traffic moving between the Delhi side and parts of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir. The NHAI will be acquiring around 400 acres of land in 28 villages for the ₹700-crore project. According to a senior NHAI official, Ashoka Buildcon Limited has been finalised to construct the project. “We have already released ₹450 crore, as per the rate fixed by the land acquisition collector,” he said.Mohali district revenue officer Gurjinder Singh Benipal said some of the landowners have raised objections over the amount of compensation, as at some places it is just ₹24 lakh per acre. “They have also given a representation to the authorities concerned, and now the state government is holding talks with the NHAI to increase the compensation. For the time being, we have put the disbursal of money on hold and we are hopeful that the issue will be resolved soon,” he said.The NHAI had come up with this project after scrapping the project to widen the 40-km Kharar-Banur-Tepla road in July 2019, owing to its high cost. Even MP Manish Tewari had taken up the need for an alternative route with Union minister Nitin Gadkari in February 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-nhai-s-700-cr-project-hits-roadblock-101629831184601.html
25-08-2021||Mumbai||Row over Rane’s remarks: 3 FIRs in Mumbai after clashes between Sena, BJP workers||Mumbai Police on Tuesday evening registered three first information reports (FIR) following protests and clashes between Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) workers that erupted after Union minister Narayan Rane’s objectionable comments on Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray.Santacruz police station has registered two cross FIRs under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Disaster Management Act against eight known accused and some unknown persons in the both cases.Vishwas Nangre Patil, joint commissioner of police (law and order), said that a large crowd had gathered outside Rane’s Juhu residence and started shouting slogans against the Shiv Sena. Workers from the Sena also reached the spot and began abusing BJP workers, after which a clash took place between the two groups. The police tried to restrain the crowd and disperse them to avert any injuries.“There was adequate police force to prevent the clashes but a mob came and resorted to stone pelting. We, however, dispersed the crowd before any untoward incident took place,” said Patil.The third FIR was registered at Kasturba Marg police station in Borivli (East) under the relevant sections of IPC and the Bombay Police Act against six people and 80-90 unidentified people. The officers said that the accused were detained at the respective police stations later in the evening.Another FIR against RaneMeanwhile, Rane faces another FIR after a case was registered against him in Thane on Tuesday afternoon for his remarks against Thackeray. According to Naupada police, the FIR was filed on the basis of a complaint by Thane mayor Naresh Mhaske, who reached the police station around 11.30am on Tuesday. “I believe that Rane’s statement has the potential to create disharmony and enmity in the society as well as harm the image of the CM. What he has said can lead to clashes between activists of different parties,” Mhaske told the police in his statement. An officer with Naupada police said, “Based on Mhaske’s statement, an FIR on defamation and making statements amounting to public mischief under the Indian Penal Code has been filed against Rane.” Rane’s statement has led to clashes between Shiv Sena and BJP members in Thane too. Shiv Sainiks pelted stones and threw ink bottles at BJP office in Khopat. BJP workers raised slogans against the Shiv Sena. In Kalyan (West), several Shiv Sena leaders thronged outside BJP office and vandalised its window. They also put a footwear garland on Rane’s effigy. Shiv Sena party workers also staged a protest outside the Kalyan tehsildar’s office. The BJP office at Ahilya Bai Chowk in Kalyan (West) was vandalised and a BJP worker was manhandled. In Kalyan (East), some Shiv Sena workers were detained during their protest. Protests were organised in Vashi, where the Shiv Sena resorted to rasta rook. In Airoli, Rane’s effigy was thrashed with footwear and burnt, while in Kharghar, the protestors marched to the police station, demanding that a case be registered against him. Former opposition leader Vijay Chougule of Shiv Sena said, “If anyone thinks that we will sit quietly on challenging our leader Uddhav Thackeray and the Shiv Sena, we will teach them a lesson. Narayan Rane is a senior politician who should know what language he should be used.” As reports of Rane’s arrest began coming in, Shiv Sena’s Raigad district advisor Baban Patil led the party’s celebrations in Panvel and by bursting crackers. Meanwhile, the BJP protested against Rane’s arrest. Protest on Mumbai-Goa roadThe women’s cell of Shiv Sena from Raigad staged a protest on the Mumbai- Goa road and in Mahad, claiming that if Rane ever steps foot in Raigad, they would make him wear bangles. The cell had conducted protests at various places in Raigad. Before Rane’s arrest, Sena workers had blocked the Mumbai-Goa highway, demanding an apology by the Union minister over his comment, and also organised a protest at Shivaji Chowk in Mahad. Sapna Malusare, Mahad panchayat samiti chairman, said, “Rane got his identity because of [late Sena founder] Balasaheb Thackeray. Rane could reach such heights because of the Thackeray family, and today he dared to speak ill of Uddhav Thackeray. If he ever steps in Raigad, we will make him wear bangles.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/row-over-rane-s-remarks-3-firs-in-mumbai-after-clashes-between-sena-bjp-workers-101629831065087.html

The civic body is taking steps to involve the informal sector, which is currently collecting waste from the households along with the MC. It will also purchase e-rickshaws for door-to-door collection.Further, the civic body is conducting a micro survey in the city to determine the number of kitchens in each building. Based on this, it will fix the waste collection charges. The officials stated that the MC has completed 25% of the survey. The MC is also gathering information about the garbage collectors of every area. MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal also conducted a review meeting regarding the same with MC officials on Tuesday. Citing the census 2011 data, the MC officials stated that there were around 3.5 lakh properties in the city at that time but, there is no data available regarding the number of the same at present. The MC has not been able to streamline door to door collection of garbage in the city due to the presence of the informal sector. The informal sector, which charges a certain fee from the residents for the collection of waste without any regulation, raises agitation whenever MC tries handing it over to the private sector. Even in 2011, when the MC appointed A2Z company for solid waste management in the city, the informal sector had raised concern. Under the Chandigarh model, the civic body has decided to involve the informal sector and to ensure a certain amount to the collectors involved.MC commissioner Sabharwal said,” MC is working to streamline solid waste management in the city, and tenders are also being floated for processing over 1,100 metric tonnes of waste generated in the city daily.”“A team of MC officials also visited Chandigarh last month to study the waste management model there,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/solid-waste-management-ludhiana-mc-initiates-work-on-implementation-of-chandigarh-model-in-city-101629830767779.html

25-08-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana sees no new Covid case after more than a year||It was on May 27, 2020, when Ludhiana had seen no new case of Covid-19 ever since the pandemic began. On Tuesday, the feat was achieved again after more than a year, when the district added no fresh patient to its tally. Only one person each had tested positive for the viral disease on August 9 and August 23, which was the lowest count reported since August 1, 2020, when the health department began maintaining the list of daily Covid cases.During the peak of the first wave, 438 fresh cases were reported in the district on September 15. As the first wave subsided, the least number of cases the district had logged was five on November 11. When the second wave of the contagion had peaked in Ludhiana in May this year, the daily case count had hit the all-time high of 1,729 on May 9 and a record 30 deaths were registered twice, on May 10 and 11. The district had registered 29,529 cases and 624 deaths in May, highest since the pandemic started last year, leaving the health infrastructure crumbling. However, the situation started improving with the imposition of stricter curbs and restriction on public movement.Compared to May, June accounted for 2,849 infections and 87 casualties. While only 334 cases and five deaths surfaced in July, 159 cases and three deaths have been reported till August 24, lowest in 16 months. The elusive zeroDistrict epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Bhagat said it was satisfying to hit the elusive number zero. “I have been waiting for this day since March 24, 2020, when the first case was reported in the district. Since then, we have been striving to bring down the cases to zero. I want to congratulate the health department, administration, police and especially the people of Ludhiana for helping in reaching this point,” he added. Experts caution against complacencyDespite the respite from the worrisome numbers, health experts have cautioned that no Covid case doesn’t mean no responsibility.Civil surgeon Dr Kiran Ahluwalia said, “Zero case does not mean that coronavirus has vanished. The residents must continue to adhere to safety protocols and also get vaccinated at the earliest. Only by following simple rules of wearing masks, sanitising hands and maintaining social distance that this virus could be defeated.”Dr Bishav Mohan, member of the Punjab Covid task force, said, “We have achieved a milestone but at the same time, we can’t lower our guards. It is important that more and more people get vaccinated and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. People should come forward to get tested if symptoms appear as the virus is still deadly. Timely response can save lives.”No patient admitted in hospitalCurrently, no Covid patient from Ludhiana is undergoing treatment at any government or private hospital in the district. There are 35 active cases in the district and all of those are under home isolation. The health department has collected 8,695 samples on Tuesday. While the total number of positive cases in the district stands at 87,457, as many as 85,326 patients have recovered.Five fresh infections take district’s dengue count to 23Five more people were found suffering from dengue on Tuesday, taking the total number of cases to 23. There are 430 suspected patients, who had been suffering from dengue-like symptoms.According to district epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Bhagat, as many as 21 cases of the vector-borne disease were reported from the urban areas, while one case each was reported from Sidhwan Bet and Jagraon.He said that majority of the cases were reported from Kailash Chowk, Bhamia Road, Chander Nagar, Janata Nagar, Model Town, Basti Jodhewal, Rani Jhansi Road, Ferozepur Road, Ashapuri and Civil Lines areas.He said that 20 residents from other districts have also tested positive of dengue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-sees-no-new-covid-case-after-more-than-a-year-101629830706785.html

25-08-2021||Chandigarh||Bitumen contractors to stall work citing ‘corruption, wrong policies’ of Ludhiana MC||Compounding troubles for the Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) and the Congress ahead of the assembly elections, bitumen contractors in the city have announced to boycott road construction projects in the city citing “corruption and wrong policies adopted by the civic body for allotment of such projects”. During a meeting held at a hotel on Ferozepur Road on Tuesday, members of Ludhiana Hotmix Plant Welfare Association said projects worth around ₹200 crore will be affected if the MC failed to take corrective measures. These include the projects which have already been allotted by the MC besides those for which tenders have been floated. Among their other concerns is the condition imposed by the MC wherein the bitumen contractors have been directed to quote and complete the road construction projects within 6% lesser amount in comparison to the estimate prepared by the civic body. President of the association, Vinod Jain said, “It is not feasible for a contractor to complete the project and earn a marginal profit by quoting 94% of the estimated amount. We need to quote at least 98% of that amount. The government has fixed the estimates for completing different works and tenders are floated online. Even if a contractor submits a bid to complete the project in one percent lesser than the estimate amount, the MC has no right to force him to quote at least 6% lesser rate as the contractor has got the tender by quoting the lowest amount among other bidders. If the contractor does not quote the lower rate, then the contract is given to some other contractor of their choice.”The contractors, including association’s chairperson Amrik Singh, vice-president Bhagwan Das and Sunil Kumar among others, stated that due to the “prevalent corruption” in the MC, tenders were not allotted to the lowest bidder, but the second lowest bidder in “exchange of commission”. They also claimed that the projects under the Smart City Mission were being given to the contractors who did not even meet the requirements. “If any contractor raises objection, officials initiate a process to blacklist him. Security amount submitted by contractors in the last two years has not been refunded even after the completion of projects. MC officials even ask for a commission for releasing the payment for completed works. We will not operate the hotmix plant until the issues are resolved. We also urge Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh to take corrective steps and initiate action against corrupt officials,” Jain added. ‘Public representatives also involved’The association of contractors alleged that public representatives, especially from the Congress, were also involved in the nexus due to which, no action was taken against officials. Without naming anyone, the contractors said that they had also submitted a complaint to the mayor in the past, but to no avail. Will not succumb to pressure mounted by contractors: Mayor Accusing the contractors of looting the MC by forming a pool and quoting lower rates for road construction projects and further employing tactics such as a boycott, Ludhiana mayor Balkar Sandhu said the civic body will instead use ready mixed concrete for road construction projects and would not succumb to the pressure being mounted by the contractors.“The bitumen projects will be converted into ready mixed concrete ones after approval in the F&CC meeting. The MC might have to spend a little more, but we will neither compromise with the quality nor allow the contractors to loot the hard-earned money of the taxpayers,” he added. Public to face harassmentWith residents already facing inconvenience due to poor condition of roads in different parts of the city, the tussle between the civic body and the contractors is further set to harass the public as the road projects will get delayed. Deep potholes can be seen even on main roads of the city, including Gill Road, Dugri Road, Model Town-Jawaddi Road, Haibowal, Giaspura and BRS Nagar areas among others, while waterlogging during the rainy season adds to the woes of commuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bitumen-contractors-to-stall-work-citing-corruption-wrong-policies-of-ludhiana-mc-101629830704687.html

The HC also did not hear a separate petition seeking quashing of the three first information reports (FIR) registered against Rane at various police stations for making inappropriate comments against chief minister Uddhav Thackeray during a speech at Raigad on Monday in the course of the Jan Ashirwad Yatra.According to sources, the registry of the HC sought the original copy of the order by the Ratnagiri court, before allowing the filing of the appeal. Sources also said that after getting the original copy of the court order, attempts would be made to file the appeal and get an urgent hearing on Wednesday. The appeal filed by advocate Aniket Nikam was mentioned before a bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, even as Rane was taken into custody by Sangameshwar police station. However, the court directed Nikam to follow due procedure before approaching the court. Nikam approached the bench of HC soon after the lunch hour concluded at 2.30pm, and mentioned the two applications seeking anticipatory bail and quashing of the FIRs filed against Rane at Pune, Nashik and Mahad. Rane has been booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code which including section 500 (defamation), 505(2) (intent to incite), 153 (b) (1) (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration).While speaking to the media, Nikam said as the maximum sentence for the offences under which Rane was booked was seven years, the MP was eligible for bail. He further added that the police failed to issue a notice, as stipulated under section 41 A of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), before taking Rane into custody, which was a procedural lapse. The offence at Nashik has been registered by the cyber police under sections 500, 505(2), 153 (b) (1) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) based on the complaint of the local unit chief of Shiv Sena. Following the registration of the complaint, the police commissioner of Nashik issued an order to arrest the minister and formed a team. In Pune, the FIR has been registered under sections 153 and 505 of the IPC, following a complaint by a member of the Yuva Sena and the third FIR in Mahad was also registered on a complaint from Siddesh Patekar, a Yuva Sena office holder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-bombay-hc-relief-for-narayan-rane-101629830649309.html

Then, none of them uttered a single word on Article 370. The PAGD leaders know that restoration of Article 370 is next to impossible but to mislead the people of Kashmir again and again they are using the age-old tactics of deceit and deception to create an atmosphere against the policies of the BJP government.” Expressing surprise over the ‘acumen’ of PAGD leaders demanding the restoration of Article 370, the senior BJP leader claimed this contentious Article gave J&K unemployment, terrorism, under-development, poverty, hunger and all other ills plaguing the region.“If the PAGD leaders really wanted upliftment of the people of UT of J&K, they would have demanded more industry, avenues to promote tourism especially international as it is the mainstay of the UT and government jobs for educated youth. The alliance is seeking a return of the dark era in Kashmir. The Centre will never allow this to happen,” he claimed, adding, “People are now wary of the destructive game-plan of the PAGD. They will not fall prey to it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/demand-for-article-370-restoration-pagd-leaders-befooling-kashmiris-says-ex-deputy-chief-minister-gupta-101629830585021.html

Political workers from across J&K attended, with top leaders like Farooq Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti addressing the gathering. Leaders and workers of the NC alliance; Peoples Democratic Party; Communist Party of India (Marxist); J&K Awami National Conference and the J&K People’s Movement participated.PAGD spokesman and the general secretary of CPI(M), Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami, said, “Unconstitutional decisions of August 5, 2019 taken in Parliament to nullify Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution of India and the damaging legislation which dismembered the historic state and created two Union Territories – Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh - has created a big political void. It is extremely unfortunate that judicial challenges to the abrogation, as a violation of the Constitution, continue to remain pending before the Supreme Court even after two years.”Tarigami, who was flanked by top leaders of the alliance, claimed that the suppression of civil liberties and democratic rights continues unabated in J&K.“Attack on democratic rights under draconian laws like UAPA/PSA continues; hundreds remain under detention without even charges being framed. New orders are being passed like non-clearance of passports and no government services to anyone involved in ‘law and order’ or ‘stone pelting cases’. This negates the principle of natural justice by equating a police report with being guilty. Jurisprudence underlines that everyone is innocent till proven guilty. “He said that by making the status of permanent residents of erstwhile state redundant, the protection of jobs and land rights were snatched arbitrarily.“The economy of the region is getting from bad to worse by the day, as promises of development, investment and job creation of the government have fallen flat. Instead of creating new employment opportunities, daily wagers, casual labourers, scheme workers and other contractual employees are either not getting wages regularly or are being denied their wages. Agriculture and horticulture, tourism, handicraft, transport and other sectors are in deep crisis.”Tarigami said that successive executive orders post August 2019 like domicile laws, curbs on media, intimidation of government employees, discriminatory rules on employment were just some authoritarian diktats that had been imposed on J&K residents .“Termination of some employees without giving them a chance to be heard, has created a fear psychosis. Local officers are being sidelined. The abolition of state cadre is one more step towards disempowerment of the people,” the PAGD spokesperson said, adding, “Leaders condemned the killings of unarmed persons, including political activists. It is imperative J&K residents remain united and not fall prey to false campaigns to divide them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pagdpasses-restoration-seeking-original-status-of-jammu-kashmir-and-ladakh-101629830164633.html

The district will have all 11 plants by end of this month,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer and nodal officer for new oxygen plants in Ghaziabad.The 166-bed MMG District Hospital, which served as a dedicated Covid facility during the first wave of the pandemic, had to rely on oxygen cylinders.“We have got installed a 150 litres per minute (lpm) capacity oxygen plant, and another 1000 lpm capacity plant is being installed. With the two plants, our reliance on oxygen cylinders can now be done away with. Our hospital now has fully oxygenated beds,” said Dr Anurag Bhargava, chief medical superintendent of the hospital.Likewise, the officials of the 100-bed Sanjay Nagar hospital said that they have got installed two new oxygen plants of 150 lpm and 500 lpm capacity.“Both the plants will be able to provide sufficient oxygen to all the beds in case of any third Covid-19 wave. We also have one old plant that provides oxygen to just 25 beds. Now, with the two new plants, our hospital has a centralised oxygen supply,” said Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of the hospital.The Sanjay Nagar hospital served as a dedicated Covid facility during the first and the second waves of the pandemic. It resumed normal services about a fortnight ago.According to official records of the state health department, the six districts under the Meerut division have sanction of 55 new oxygen plants in government health care facilities and 36 of them have been made functional so far.The enhancement of oxygen supplies is part of directions from the UP government, which is upgrading the health care infrastructure before any eventuality of a third Covid wave.According to the officials in Lucknow, the state has about 56,000 isolation beds and 18,000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds (including 6,600 paediatric ICU beds) as part of the plan to deal with any third wave.They said that installation of oxygen plants is one of the measures and 336 of the overall new 552 sanctioned oxygen plants have come up so far.“To check the preparedness before any third wave, senior state health department officials will conduct inspections in all the districts on August 27 and 28. They will inspect the Covid vaccination facilities, functionality of PICU and isolation beds, besides operationality of the oxygen plants and other equipment,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-two-district-hospitals-now-self-reliant-in-oxygen-supply-101629827763703.html
25-08-2021||Pune||We will have our fully ‘Made in India’ PSA unit ready within a month, says Dr Ashish Lele, director, NCL Pune||Dr Ashish Lele, director, National Chemical Laboratory (NCL) in Pune to Dheeraj Bengrut about the role NCL played during the pandemic and new research projects going on at the institute. Dr Lele was former chief scientist at CSIR-NCL and took charge of NCL on April 1, 2021. Dr Lele has also served as senior VP and head, Advanced Materials and Alternative Energy Group, Reliance Industries, prior to take this posting.How do you plan to take NCL forward now that you are director?In last five months since I have joined NCL, there are few things I am trying to bring in. I am trying to re-emphasise this. These are fundamental things, as there is a purpose for this laboratory, which is why it was started. It is to advance knowledge and use chemical science for the good of people. We actively encourage our scientists and our research students to take a leadership role in science in their own areas. And the second part is to apply science for the good of people, which means we need to take science and convert it for uses for our country, as well globally. The other thing which we do is work with the industry... we interact with them, work and develop technologies with them. How do we make this happen? For that first we have to choose the right problems to work upon. There are certain important trends happening in India and the planet, for example climate change is a problem. All these are difficult problems and we have to break it up in different parts to work on. We then protect that knowledge of good science, and work towards converting it for real life usage. It is worked in stages - laboratory, bench, pilot experiment and then scale for production. What new research projects and initiatives are currently related to the Covid pandemic? NCL developed Pressure Swing Absorption (PSA) technology which allows continual supply of oxygen taken from the air. CSIR NCL has developed this technology and we have set up more than 200 PSA units across the country, which is saving lives of patients in this critical times. There is a material in that PSA unit which actually separates oxygen from air - it is called zeolite, and we are currently importing it from other countries. So we are bujilding the entire plant, but its heart - the zeolite is brought from outside. We took up the challenge to develop zeolite on our own. After I joined, we put a team of 10 to 12 scientists from different divisions on the project. I am happy to tell that we are finally made the ‘zeolite’ material as a pilot and there are many aspects of technology which we called basic engineering. So we will have our fully ‘Made in India’ PSA unit in our country and within a month it will be on the market. This will not stop here and we will continue to develope multiple zeolites and other products. Another important project which we are working or rather participating in which is done across the country is genome surveillance. It is an all India effort, several institutions are participating in it and every week we collect around 200 Covid samples and we upload data. This surveillance helps us understand the spread of the virus, and who are more vulnerable, among other things. Any new academic courses or skill development projects for research students coming up at NCL?We want to go beyond our research Phd students and for that we are offering skilling programmes for industry professionals. So industries send their engineers and young people for traininig and we have a year long calendar every year. This year two new skill development programmes would be added. One about green hydrogen technology to generate energy. And also the sewage surveillance system which we are currently doing for the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). We can always help other research institutes to set up a course and call other scientific institution students to the NCL for training.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/we-will-have-our-fully-made-in-india-psa-unit-ready-within-a-month-101629824705496.html

It was my first attempt and I made a small idol,” said Trupti Marne, a housewife and resident of Kothrud.This year she pre-planned the making of a colourful Ganesh idol.“On August 28, I will start making the idol. It takes two-three days to dry the structure completely. Once it is dried , one can colour it. Between August 1-3, I will colour it so our Idol will be ready before the chaturthi,” said Marne. Making the idol at home has increased family bonding time for many.“Me and my son have decided make the Ganesh idol at out home. Our society has decided to not have a Ganesh idol due to the Covid threat. I used to do eco-friendly decorations in our society every year. My father used to make Lord Ganesh from shadu mati. Now I will be doing it for the first time,” said Namrata Jawale, a Balewadi resident.“The last one-and-a-half year was tough for all of us. Because of the pandemic, there are restrictions. So this year we decided to do everything at home. We decided the theme, and went shopping for all the required material to make an eco-friendly Ganpati,” added Jawale, who has already completed the basic idol.“Our Ganesh idol is drying. My son is going to decorate it with natural colors and some ornaments and natural flowers,” added Jawale.Seema Pradhan, a 65-year old retired teacher who was fond of paintings was urged by her son Bhushan Pradhan, an actor to make an idol of shadu mati this year.“Being a teacher by proffession, I never got time to celebrate the Ganesh festival with complete devotion. In 2016, I was told my son to make an idol for our home, from then on, I started to make the idol at home,” said Pradhan, who has also received orders of 12 of his clay idols this year.“During lockdown in 2020, while I was making the idol, my 85-year old mother wanted me to do it as a business. She passed away last December and in her memory, for the first time, I took orders ,” added Pradhan, who decotes seven hours a day to making the idols.“I close my eyes and seek his blessing before making the idol. Moulding it properly gives satisfaction ,” added Pradhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punekars-make-ganesh-idols-at-home-to-keep-covid-threat-at-bay-101629824163263.html
25-08-2021||Patna||HC asks petitioner to move Lokayukta with complaint against BRABU V-C||The Patna High Court on Tuesday directed a petitioner to approach the Lokayukta with his complaint alleging serious irregularities in appointments and financial lapses by BRA Bihar University (Muzaffarpur) vice-chancellor Hanuman Prasad Pandey, registrar Dr RK Thakur and CCDC Dr Amita Sharma.The petitioner, Md Umer Shekh, has accused the V-C and his associates of regularisation of over 500 illegal appointments and making illegal payments, 37 illegal appointments in Nalanda Open University, where Pandey held additional charge till a couple of days ago, handing over charge of eight full-time posts to Sharma, who also allegedly carried out illegal appointments for vocational courses, tampering with the merit list for M.Ed to change names of 70 candidates, no reservation roster compliance in the appointment of guest teachers for history, double payment to some teachers from two places and discrepancies in tender allotment for printing.The petitioner had sought direction to the state government to hold a proper inquiry into the entire affairs of Pandey and his associates by an independent agency or a special investigation team (SIT). The petitioner said he had also approached the Chancellor’s office, the state government, the member of Parliament of Muzaffarpur and the members of the Legislative Assembly in April itself to apprise them of the arbitrary functioning of the V-C in connivance with his trusted officials.“The university seems to have become a den of corruption and it calls for a thorough probe,” senior advocate PK Shahi, appearing for the petitioner, told the bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Sanjay Kunar, who asked the petitioner to move Lokayukta.“The complaint petition will soon be filed before the Lokayukta in the light of the court observation,” Shahi said.In the recent past, Raj Bhawan had also set up inquiry against three present V-Cs — Magadh University V-C, JP University V-C and Pandey.Earlier, several V-Cs and proV-Cs had to resign or were removed on corruption charges.Pandey was not available for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/hc-asks-petitioner-to-move-lokayukta-with-complaint-against-brabu-vc-101629822309384.html
