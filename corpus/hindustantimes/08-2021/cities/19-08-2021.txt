During the drive, which started in 2014, the Mumbai Police put in extra efforts to trace missing children under the age of 14 years.In the 10th operation in July, 105 girls and 23 boys were traced. Of them, eight children were found to be engaged as child labourers.After tracing the children with the help of child welfare committee and non-government organisations, the police also helped in reuniting the children with their families or arranging their rehabilitation at children’s homes. Police officers said most of the children found were involved in the begging racket or wandering aimlessly on roads and railway stations.A special month-long drive was conducted from July 1 to July 31 during which the police force put in rigorous efforts to track down missing children. Officers said a majority of the cases are of runaway children due to family harassment or fights.Apart from Mumbai Police, Railway Protection Force (RPF) rescued 477 children from railway platforms at stations on Central Railway in the past seven months across Maharashtra and reunited them with their parents. RPF officers said these include 310 boys and 167 girls. Anil Kumar Lahoti, general manager of Central Railway, said the railways play its role of social responsibility by connecting with the runaway children, understanding their problems and counselling them to go with their family. “We appreciate RPF and frontline staff who play an important role by identifying such cases with their innate sense and taking immediate action as a counsellor,” said Lahoti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/operation-muskaan-mumbai-police-traced-128-missing-children-101629397501697.html

The authority had started work on this underpass on June 11, 2020 with an aim to provide smooth connectivity between sector 137/142 and sector 168, among others located along the expressway. Once operational, the underpass will benefit the residents living in dozens of newly built housing complexes, commercial areas and IT-enabled firms functional in this cluster, said officials.“We have completed 66 % overall work on this project and the work is in full swing so that we can complete the work at earliest,” said Rajeev Tyagi chief general manager of the Noida authority.The authority that is spending Rs43 crore on this underpass project has scheduled completion of this project on December 10, 2021. This 434-metre length underpass is being built with ‘push back’ technology in a manner so that it does not trouble the smooth flow of traffic.“We are using push-back construction methodology to construct this underpass so that the work is kept going on without disrupting the regular vehicular movement on the Expressway,” Tyagi.“In this technique concrete boxes are casted and pushed through the road embankments through jacking to build beds. The advantage of this technology is that it does not disrupt the traffic above road under which an underpass is being built. And it saves a lot of time in construction,” said Tyagi.Residents said that once this underpass is completed and ready for use we will not have to face traffic congestion on Noida Expressway in order to commute from sector 168/135 side to sector 137/142 side.“As of now existing small underpasses located in this area witnesses huge traffic snarls because two vehicles cannot pass through at one time. As a result we have stuck for long time particularly during peak hours in evening and morning. This underpass will address congestion issues to large extent,” said Deepika Singh, a resident of sector 135.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/66-work-on-advant-underpass-completed-101629397496940.html

19-08-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Woman, two aides arrested for killing friend, burying body in her house||Police on Thursday arrested a 19-year-old woman and her two friends linked to the murder of 19-year-old man from Muradnagar who was found buried in the woman’s house on August 11. The victim and suspects in the case are from the village of Khairajpur, said police.Police said that the victim, Mohammad Mursaleen, was allegedly a friend of the woman, who they identified by a single name as Ayesha. An autopsy report confirmed death by strangulation, said a police officer. Police identified the other two arrested suspects as Mohammad Usman and Arif and said two other suspects, Zubair and Zeeshan, were absconding. All were between 19 and 25 years of age, they added.Police said they had succeeded in establishing the sequence of events that led to Mursaleen’s murder. On August 11, Ayesha allegedly called him to her home.“When we questioned her, Ayesha told us that had been pressing her to marry him. She told this to her two suspects - Zubair and Usman who had a previous altercation with the victim over another issue. Thereafter, they planned to get rid of the victim,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural). The woman allegedly told the police that when the victim reached her house, her two friends allegedly murdered him, while she kept watch at the door.“They wanted to dispose of the body outside but found that it would be difficult to move out of the locality without anyone noticing. So, they dug up a patch in the house and buried it. Upon questioning and investigation, three suspects were arrested while a search is on for others,” the SP said. Police said Zeeshan helped bury the body.The family of the victim had filed a missing person complaint with the Muradnagar police on August 15 after extensive searches failed to throw up any clues. A police investigation traced his mobile phone SIM card to an ice-cream vendor near the woman’s house. The woman had allegedly wrapped the SIM card in a ₹500 currency note and given it to him in an effort to dispose of evidence, said police. The vendor led police to the woman’s house from where the body was exhumed after she was questioned, said officials.Mursaleen’s family named seven suspects in the case, including Ayesha’s mother, brother and the Ayesha’s friend Arif, in their police complaint following the discovery of body. “The family’s role in the case is being probed as we suspect they knew that the body was buried in the house. Once established, they will also be arrested,” said an officer from Muradnagar police station. Police said that Arif had no role in murder, but was booked for allegedly threatening the victim as alleged by his family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-woman-two-aides-arrested-for-killing-friend-burying-body-in-her-house-101629397212556.html
19-08-2021||Mumbai||Technical glitches in app lead to troubles for anganwadi workers||Arti Salve, 39, an anganwadi worker (AW) in Beed, bought a smartphone worth ₹4,000 in April 2020 for her 12-year-old son’s online school education. But since last month, she has taken away his phone to upload details including photographs of malnourished children, pregnant women and lactating mothers on the centralised application — Poshan Tracker. The smartphone with 2GB RAM that the Centre gave to her in 2019 is unable to support the Poshan Tracker, and Salve doesn’t have the money to buy another smartphone for herself. “We are responsible for collecting data on height and weight of kids to maintain a record of malnourished children, as well as daily data on lactating mothers and pregnant women. This work can’t be done by sitting at home. We are always on the field even amid the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Salve who gets ₹6,000 as monthly remuneration. Salve’s story is not an isolated case. There are around 125,000 anganwadi workers in the state, earning a monthly income between ₹4,500 and ₹8,000, depending on their years of experience, who are facing the same hurdle with smartphones and the app.Getting no recourse despite repeated complaints and grievances, starting August 17, AWs have started returning the insufficient phones to the state women and child department (WCD) that will continue till the end of this month, as a mark of protest. Since the launch of the protest at least 1,000 phones have been returned, said MA Patil from Maharashtra Rajya ASHA Gatpravatak Karamchari Kruti Samiti.Warranty period is over, AWs asked to pay from their pocketsAround six months ago, under the Union women and child development ministry, Poshan Tracker app was launched in India with an aim to monitor nutritional outcomes in real-time which will be vital in improving maternal and child health.“The app keeps hanging every time they try to upload a photo. So, they have to reinitiate the uploading process repeatedly,” said Patil.The warranty of the phones expired in March. Since then, AWs have to pay for repair from their own pockets, which becomes financially constraining. “These phones are not of good quality. So, often cameras malfunction or hardware gets damaged. Hence, these need repairing which costs between ₹500 to ₹2,000. AWs with such a low salary cannot afford it,” added Patil.Not wanting to stop their work, many AWs like Salve have started using their private phones. However, AWs are not getting the money to charge their internet package. “AWs get ₹599 for a three-month package. But those who are using their private phones are not getting the money. So, they are paying the money from their pockets,” said Kamal Parulekar, secretary, Anganwadi Sevika Union. Additionally, there have also been reports that the app is infringing the privacy of Aws, as without their authorisation the app is automatically uninstalling social media apps like Facebook among others. In July first week, Anganwadi Karmachari Sabha approached the Bombay high court (HC) seeking intervention in the matter. “The payment of AWs’ honorarium is linked to logging in data into the app. These technical errors are affecting the income of AWs. We have, therefore, approached HC with the demand that the pay shouldn’t get deducted,” said Patil.Anganwadi workers have filed complaints with state WCD minister Yashomati Thakur who claimed that the Central government has not released the fund. Despite repeated attempts, Thakur was unavailable for a comment.Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, many families have lost their livelihood which has affected their income. This has also affected the nutritional intake among children which can increase cases of malnutrition in the state, said activists. “Thus, it is essential to maintain accurate data for the formulation of policies and schemes. If this continues, it will have a long-term impact on the health of children and mothers amid the ongoing pandemic,” said Parulekar. Poshan Tracker riddled with loopholes “Almost 90% of anganwadi workers have completed Class 10 and have mostly studied in Marathi medium schools. They cannot read English, but the application is completely in English. On a daily basis, they have to seek help from neighbours or their children to fill up the forms,” said Patil.Also, there is no option to delete a form. “So, if someone has typed a wrong name in English, AWs cannot delete it from the app. This is leading to inaccurate reporting,” Parulekar. The application doesn’t upload updated information automatically which is further hindering the nutrition plan of the needy children and mothers. The nutrition scheme of the children is divided into three age-wise categories — newborn to six-month-olds; six-month to three-year-olds, and three-year to six-year-olds. But when a three-year-old child becomes a year older, the application doesn’t update it. Thus, the child keeps getting a nutrition package of the second age category. Similarly, women remain enlisted in the category of pregnant even after her delivery. So, she keeps getting the nutrition package of a pregnant woman. Whereas the nutrition requirement of a lactating mother is completely different,” said Parulekar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/technical-glitches-in-app-lead-to-troubles-for-anganwadi-workers-101629397207981.html

After the Sachdeva group approached the police and members were allowed to enter, a heated argument was witnessed between the two groups.Meanwhile, Kular said that Chawla is trying to get mileage ahead of the elections of the association, which is due in the first week of September. He claimed that there is resentment against him currently and added that the police have lodged the FIR against them under pressure.Members meet police commissioner, seek probeMembers of the United Alliance Group met police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal on Thursday and sought a probe into the matter. Sachdeva said the meeting was convened following Covid protocol. “The hall of the association building has capacity to accommodate 1,000 members, but they had placed 150 chairs. Another 250 chairs were placed outside the hall. After 150 members entered, Chawla restricted entry of more members,” he said.He added that at the time of incident, Walaity Ram, Asru Ram Gupta and other office bearers were on the stage and are not visible anywhere in the video. “We handed over the videos of incident to the police commissioner and sought a probe,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/day-after-assault-on-ucpma-chief-31-booked-101629396478348.html

19-08-2021||Kolkata||CBI, SIT to probe Bengal post-election violence: HC||The Calcutta high court on Thursday ordered separate probes by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the state police into alleged post-poll violence in West Bengal this year.A five-judge bench headed by acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal said CBI will probe the serious allegations of rape and murder and a three-member SIT those of arson and loot, under the court’s supervision.“All the cases where, as per the report of the committee, the allegations are about murder and crime against women regarding rape and attempt to rape, shall be transferred to CBI for investigation. It is made clear that it shall be a court-monitored investigation,” the order stated.The investigation of SIT, comprising three senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officers Soumen Mitra (commissioner of Kolkata Police), Suman Bala Sahoo (director general-communication) and Ranveer Kumar (additional director general-administration) will also be monitored by the court and overseen by a retired judge of the Supreme Court. The high court also directed the Mamata Banerjee government to pay compensation to the victims of violence directly into their bank accounts after due verification.The state has said it will appeal the verdict.“I don’t see it as a setback. It is a judgment passed. If the litigant, which in this case is the state, finds that the verdict is not in its interest or beyond law, we have the right to challenge. We are waiting for the order. We will definitely move the Supreme Court,” said Sanjay Basu, advocate who appeared for the DGP of West Bengal along with senior advocates including Abhishek Manu Singhvi. He added that the observations in the order are not correct.Soon after the results of the assembly elections were declared on May 2, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made allegations of widespread post-poll violence from across the state. With petitions filed in the immediate aftermath, the high court took cognisance and in June, the court asked the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to form a seven member committee “considering the fact that there was blatant violation of human rights besides violation of other rights of the victims”. The committee submitted its final report on July 13 recommending a CBI probe, and that trials should be held outside the state.The committee said at least 1,934 complaints were lodged with the state police between May 2 and June 20. They included 29 complaints related to murder, 12 to rape and sexual assault, and 940 of loot and arson with the committee receiving around 1,979 reports covering 15,000 victims.The order quoted acting chief justice Bindal as saying: “In our opinion, the heinous crimes such as murder and rape deserve to be investigated by an independent agency which in circumstances can only be the Central Bureau of Investigation. It is for the reason that in a number of cases, the State had failed to register the FIRs and opined the same to not be cases of murder. In some cases, even after registration of FIR, the observation by the State is that these may result in ‘no case’. This shows a predetermined mind to take investigation into a particular direction.”The order comes as a setback to the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC), with party MP Saugata Roy saying that the handing over of cases to CBI was a “transgression” on the rights of the state. “I am unhappy with the order. Law and order is a state subject and I think it’s a transgression on the state’s rights as it is not desirable that an external agency like CBI should be allowed to intervene in a state subject repeatedly. We had opposed when the NHRC team submitted its report because some of its members had BJP links. I hope and I expect that the state would go for an appeal against the order,” he said.The BJP attacked the TMC immediately after the order and said that the court had given a strong message, and that it would not be wrong to call Mamata Banerjee a failed chief minister. “The high court has given a strong message. It should be a milestone as the court has made it clear that anarchy has no place in India. It will not be wrong to call Mamata Banerjee a failed chief minister. A chief minister has to protect all citizens. The court has shown that when administration fails, the judiciary comes to people’s rescue,” BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said.In its counter affidavit, the state government argued that the committee was set up to spearhead a witch hunt against the Banerjee’s administration and was a concerted effort to discredit a democratically elected government. Justice Bindal, however, wrote, “Though the issue of bias of three members of the committee was sought to be raised, the argument just needs to be noticed and rejected. It seems to be an argument in frustration, where on the core issue the State has been found on a wrong foot.”In his comments, justice IP Mukerji said parts of the committee’s report that expressed opinion or made recommendations were “non-est” (beyond its jurisdiction) in the eye of the law. Mukerji was critical of the role of the Election Commission of India, saying that it was ECI’s duty to direct or advise the administration to register complaints “which it did not”. In his comments he added that “it is not established that the state has shown apathy to action”, and the investigation process, in his opinion, was at the initial stage.“Truth will prevail. The CBI probe will help people get justice,” said Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh.The Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), also charged the state government with framing false charges against opposition leaders, but also charged the NHRC team of only talking to the BJP. “The state government has framed false charges against opposition leaders at random. I never killed a mosquito but there are two murder charges against me in Bengal,” said CPI(M) politburo member Hannan Mollah.CPI(M) central committee member Rabin Deb said, “Nobody visited the home of Kakali Khetrapal, one of our women activists who was murdered at Jamalpur in East Burdwan district on May 3.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/cbi-sit-to-probe-bengal-post-election-violence-hc-101629395637089.html
19-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: August sees 41% dip in Covid-19 cases||In a respite to Mumbai, Covid-19 cases seem to be on the decline, data revealed. The first 19 days of August have seen a 41% decrease in cases (5,510 infections), compared to the same period in July (9,339 infections), and a 60% drop from the corresponding time in June (13,978 infections). The figures are amid indication from experts and authorities that the devastating second Covid-19 wave, which started from April, is under control in the city and towards its tail end. The total active cases in Mumbai have also dropped to 3,030 and 85% of the 15,907 beds in Covid-19 hospitals are vacant.Also, Mumbai’s daily positivity rate has dropped. Mumbai on Thursday recorded a positivity rate of 0.5% as the civic body conducted 52,482 tests on Wednesday. The number of new Covid-19 cases reported on Thursday is 282. Overall, Mumbai has conducted 8,798,439 Covid-19 tests at an overall positivity rate of 8.41%. Dr Rahul Pandit, who is part of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task-force, said, “We are at the end of the second wave, but this is the time we need to be extra careful, especially as aspects of routine life are opening up in the city. As a city, if we grow complacent now, our caseload can increase rapidly.”While the overall bed occupancy is very low, the ICU and ventilator bed occupancy is considerably higher. Of the 2,313 ICU beds, 30.4% or 704 beds are occupied, while 1,609 are vacant. Of the 1,310 ventilator beds in Mumbai for Covid-19 patients, 34% or 451 beds are occupied, while 859 are vacant.Dr Om Shrivastav, who is also part of the task force, said, “We have seen more serious or critical patients during the second wave. Even though many Covid-19 patients did not need hospitalisation, those who delayed in getting medical attention developed serious symptoms faster. This aspect of the second wave has lingered and serious patients are still recovering.”Out of data available with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for 2,686 active cases, 38% are symptomatic, 45% are asymptomatic, and 17% are critical. On the contrary, BMC figures from March 2021 show (for 33,961 active cases on that day) 77% were asymptomatic, 21% were symptomatic, and only 2% were critical.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-august-sees-41-dip-in-covid-19-cases-101629396063077.html
19-08-2021||Other||Preparations on for BKU Mahapanchayat on Sept 5||MEERUT Preparations are in full swing for the Bharatiya Kisan Union’s (BKU’s) proposed Mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar on September 5, with Khap leaders supporting it by organising meetings in villages under their influence. A similar meeting of Deshwal Malik Khap was convened in Lankh village of Shamli district on Wednesday, in which BKU chief Naresh Tikait made a scathing attack on the ruling BJP. He called upon farmers and BKU supporters to sink their differences and team up to ensure grand success of the proposed Mahapanchayat on September 5. “It is the responsibility of all to ensure success of the Mahapanchayat,” said Tikait, hoping that “it will be historic”. Tikait said that if the BJP returned to power in Uttar Pradesh in 2022, farmers would have to pay ₹100 per hour, ₹1,000 daily and ₹3.60 lakh per year for their electricity bills. “The party’s return to power would bring misery for farmers,” he said. Comparing the price of sugarcane and electricity of UP with neighbouring Haryana, Tikait said “ Sugarcane price in Haryana is ₹350 per quintal and here ( in UP) it is ₹325 per quintal. There farmers pay monthly power bill of ₹250 and in UP it is ₹2100 to ₹2200”. Reminding the people about the BKU’s movements, he said all previous governments listened to farmers. During the movement in Bhopa village of Muzaffarnagar in 1989, the state government provided 10 to 11 tractors to those farmers whose tractors were damaged during the movement and also waived off electricity bill of 37 months. He also mentioned hike of ₹80 in sugarcane price during the rule of Mayawati (BSP) and ₹65 under Akhilesh Yadav (SP). “We should always remember the work done in favourv of farmers”, said Tikait and reminded how late Rajeev Gandhi shifted his rally from the Boat Club in Delhi because of farmers’’ protest. He said the situation was different now and every possible effort was being made to malign the image of farmers and to defame their ongoing movement. People in the meeting assured Tikait of extending their full support to the forthcoming Mahapanchayat. Meanwhile, Thambedar of Gathwala Khap Shayam Singh assured to organise bhandara at the Mahapanchayat to ensure food to the participants. BKU’s former Muzaffarnagar president Dheeraj Latiyan claimed that people were extending their support to the Mahapanchayat in every village of the region, and it would be a historic gathering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/preparations-on-for-bku-mahapanchayat-on-sept-5-101629396003580.html
19-08-2021||Other||2 hurt as shop-cum-godowngoes up in flames in Ludhiana||A massive fire broke out at a shop-cum-godown selling plastic material in Kucha No 16 of Field Ganj here this morning. Two people, including the factory owner’s son and an employee, suffered injuries in the incident. They were rushed to the hospital for treatment where they are now stated to be stable.The incident took place around 5.30am when the staff was loading disposable plastic material into the truck.Lead fire officer Harjinder Kumar said the fire first broke out at a grocery unit in the building, owned by one Gurdeep Singh. As the fire started to spread, panic-stricken residents living in the vicinity started rushing out of their houses.Gurdeep, along with his son Jagmeet, immediately reached the spot and informed the fire department. Jagmeet tried to open the shutter of the shop, but it fell upon him, leaving him injured.In the meanwhile, Toni, an employee who was stuck inside the store, tried to escape through the stairs but as the fire was spreading quickly, he was left with no option but to go the terrace and jump to an adjoining building. He successfully managed to jump to safety but suffered a fracture in his leg in the process. After this, Jagmeet and Toni were rushed to the hospital.Division No 2 station house officer, Satpal Singh Sidhu, along with the police party and PCR cops, cordoned off the area.He said that around 25 highly inflammable chemical and fuel containers were taken out safely, but a huge pile of disposable plates, cups and polythene bags which were kept in the four-story shop-cum-godown were gutted in flames. Assistant divisional fire officer (ADFO) Swarn Chand, 60, said fire tenders containing over 2.5 lakh litres of water and 25 firefighters were pressed into service to douse the flames.He said the fire was brought under control around 11am.Material worth over ₹1 crore gutted in flames, building damaged:According to a relative of Gurdeep Singh, owner of the building, stock worth over ₹1 crore was stored in the building. He said the fire arrangement was in place but before Gurdeep could use the fire hydrant, the blaze spread in the entire building.Harjinder Kumar, the lead fire officer, said the structure of the building has been badly damaged due to the fire incident. He added that the fire hydrant installed by the owner was not functional. The firefighters had to dig a hole in the wall on the fourth floor for using water guns to douse the flames.Authorities failed to check presence of inflammables in building: ResidentsAs police evacuated residents of at least 15 houses located close to the shop-cum-godown in Field Ganj area where a massive fire broke out on Thursday morning, residents complained that authorities had failed to check the presence of inflammables in the vicinity.“We learnt that several fuel containers were stored in the building. This is a densely populated area. What if an explosion had occurred? The building would have collapsed just like the plastic factory at Suffian Chowk (which was gutted in 2017). Who would have been responsible then,” asked Jagjit Singh, 68, a resident of the area.Another resident, Ajit Singh, 62, who had just returned with his wife and daughter, from a trip, said, “We were lucky that we were not at home when the fire broke out. My house is located right next to the building that caught fire. The firemen asked us stay away.”Residents revealed that this was not the first such incident at the shop-cum-godown. A labourer had died after a lift installed in the building fell on him.Tough time for copsThe cops also had a tough time controlling the crowd during firefighting operations as residents continued to assemble near the building, with scant regard for their own safety. Even children were seen walking towards building, some even trying to record the incident on their phones. SHO Satpal Singh Sidhu, who had rushed to the spot with his team, said, “It is the responsibility of elders to teach the children to stay away, but unfortunately even the elders were seen assembling near the building, obstructing the free passage of fire tenders.” Deja vu for firefighters:For the 25 firefighters who rushed to douse the flames, the incident was a stark reminder of Suffian Chowk factory fire in November 20, 2017, which had left 16 persons, including nine fire officers, dead. Witnessing large plumes of smoke, the firefighters were initially reluctant to enter the building. But after an hour of struggle, Pankaj Sharma, Varinder Singh, Gulshan Kumar decided to get in. Lead fire officer Harjinder Singh, who was coordinating the operation, said that due to the heat and smoke, the firefighters were sent in batches. In the absence of proper equipment, many firefighters were seen coughing and gasping for breath as they came out of the building. In the absence of a hydraulic ladder, the firefighter had to risk their lives and enter the building amidst fear that it may collapse any moment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2-hurt-as-shop-cum-godowngoes-up-in-flames-in-field-ganj-101629395998716.html

The visitors are required to come with a recent negative RT-PCR test report for Covid-19. Close to 300 visitors met inmates in UP jails.The meeting of jail inmates with their kin was banned earlier this year in wake of second wave of Covid-19. According to a press statement issued by the prison department, over 600 people reached at various UP jails on Monday in order to meet their relatives or family member held inside.Only those having negative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Covid-19 report tested within 72 hours were allowed to meet the inmates.

19-08-2021||Pune||Eight years since Dabholkar murder in Pune: Will CBI begin trial?||The hearing for the case involving the murder of Dr Narendra Dabholkar in Pune by two men on a bike who shot at him will take place in the Pune special court on Friday. The day also marks eight years since the murder was committed. Going by recent updates however, the case does not seem to have made any progress in the past two-and-a-half years.The murder weapon that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) claimed to have extracted from the Thane creek was later found not to match with the one used to kill Dabholkar, with the report exclusively published by Hindustan Times.Asked if this feels like going back to square one, Dr Hamid Dabholkar, the son of Dr Narendra Dabholkar, said, “It won’t be right to say that the investigation is back to where it began. By now, we have identified and jailed the shooters. The chargesheet has been filed in all four cases. What remains elusive is the bike and the weapon but that seems to be a lost cause given that it has been eight years now. However slow the pace of the investigation may be, the High Court (HC) has allowed for the trial to begin and to continue the investigation to find the main conspirators. So, I take that as positive steps. Our demand this time is going to be to focus on the main conspirators.”The CBI had applied for a stay on hearings in the lower court in October 2020. The stay, coupled with covid-19 pandemic restrictions, resulted in lack of progress in hearings for nine months. The proceedings were adjourned to later dates, even June, and finally started taking shape in July.So far, three persons have been imprisoned in the case under sections 302 (murder), 120(b) (criminal conspiracy), 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code along with section 3(25) of the Arms Act, including Dr Virendrasinh Sharadchandra Tawade, Sachin Prakashrao Andure and Sharad Bhausaheb Kalaskar. The case also includes sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).As part of decongestion procedures during the pandemic, the prison administration shifted Tawade to Yerawada central jail from the Mumbai jail as it was severely overcrowded. However in March, the court passed an order allowing him to be shifted back to Mumbai for medical treatment. While Tawade’s known medical condition was toothache, the exact medical grounds on which he was granted the transfer could not be confirmed as his lawyer, advocate Virendra Ichalkaranjikar, remained unavailable for comment despite repeated attempts to contact him.The CBI in May 2019 arrested advocate Sanjiv Punalekar and his aide Vikram Bhave in Mumbai. While advocate Punalekar got bail within a matter of months, Bhave was granted bail by the Bombay HC only in May. Tawade is an accused in the murder of Kannada scholar M M Kalburgi and is currently on bail whereas Kalaskar is an accused in the murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh.Dr Hamid Dabholkar said, “The forensic evidence has proved that the weapon was common in these cases. It is also on record that the five cases namely, Dr Dabholkar, Kalburgi, Lankesh and the Nalasopara case are a planned conspiracy.”It now remains to be seen if the CBI will initiate trial in one of the most controversial cases of our times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/eight-years-since-dabholkar-murder-in-pune-will-cbi-begin-trial-101629395758259.html
19-08-2021||Gurugram||Drain to be constructed between Subhash Chowk, Hero Honda Chowk||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) will connect the key master sewerage lines at Subhash Chowk and Hero Honda Chowk to mitigate waterlogging and related issues, by providing a drainage outlet, officials said on Thursday.The GMDA has floated a ₹1.40 crore tender for the project, bids for which will open on September 3. Work is likely to start in mid-September, officials said.Due to the absence of a master drain, sewage often mixes with the master stormwater line flowing through the two junctions, as well as sectors 33 and 72 A. During heavy rains, this clogs the stormwater drains, further compounding waterlogging issues at Hero Honda Chowk and Subhash Chowk, said officials.“Tenders for extending the sewerage line have been floated. Work is likely to commence after mid-September, once the rains subside and the skies clear up. In the interim, we are completing all the formalities for the project,” said Pardeep Kumar, chief engineer, GMDA.Kumar said that the project will also benefit future and current developmental projects in the area as it will give companies and residents a sewage outlet.This monsoon, areas around Subhash Chowk were among the worst-affected stretches, with the underpass at Hero Honda Chowk being shut on two occasions due to heavy rainwater accumulation.Such was the extent of waterlogging at Subhash Chowk on several occasions that pedestrians could be seen holding on to one another and forming a human chain to cross the stretch due to rainwater accumulation up to the waist level. Many also carried their children on their shoulders while crossing the stretch.To fix these issues, GMDA officials said that they will be laying a 600mm wide reinforced cement concrete (RCC) drain with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe, as well as constructing manholes along the three-kilometre stretch.“The entire project is expected to take six months to complete. Due to the Sohna elevated project, several drains were clogged by construction materials that hindered the outlet for rainwater. With the project expected to continue for another two years as well as the need to providing sewerage outlet in general, the existing master drain is being extended between the two junctions,” a senior GMDA official privy to the matter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/drain-to-be-constructed-between-subhash-chowk-hero-honda-chowk-101629395648975.html

A “yellow alert” was also issued for the district. On Thursday, the city recorded a maximum temperature of 37.4°C, which was four degrees above the normal, and a minimum temperature of 25.7°C. The humidity level at the end of the day was recorded at 89%. Over the next four days, the maximum temperature in Gurugram is likely to be between 30-34°C, while the minimum temperature is likely to be around 27°C.A weather warning bulletin issued by the IMD’s meteorological centre in Chandigarh predicted “heavy rain, thunderstorm and lightning, squall” in Gurugram till Sunday.According to the weekly forecast of IMD, one or two spells of rain or thundershowers are likely in the city from August 20 to 23. “Till now, Delhi-NCR was experiencing a break from monsoon, but now with south-easterly winds, the moisture content in the atmosphere is high and good rain is expected over the next few days. Due to this, the temperature is also likely to drop by up to five degrees by Saturday,” a senior IMD official said. Meanwhile, the air quality in the city has been in the moderate zone of the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily air quality bulletin over the past three days. On Thursday, the city had an air quality index of 188, with PM 2.5 the prominent pollutant. The air quality in Delhi-NCR is likely to remain largely in the satisfactory category till Tuesday, according to a bulletin issued by the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rain-predicted-mercury-set-to-drop-101629395645960.html
19-08-2021||Gurugram||Illegal farmhouse colony in Sohna demolished||An illegal under-construction farmhouse colony on 50 acres in Bhogpur and Kiranaki villages of Sohna was demolished on Thursday, officials said.Officials of the Department of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) said that the colony was being developed without necessary permissions from the competent authorities and sold to buyers in violation of norms. A developer has to obtain either change of land use permission or licence to develop a group housing or plotted colony, according to the Haryana urban development rules.RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement), said that notices had also been issued to the developers over illegal constructions, directing them to stop further work. “Since the violations did not stop, we decided that the illegal farmhouse colony, under the name of Nature Valley, in Kiranaki and Bhogpur villages of Sohna should be demolished. Four earthmoving machines were pressed into service to demolish the illegal structures spread over roughly 50 acres,” he said.DTCP officials said that a police team of 100 personnel was also called in to provide support for the drive, in which the boundary wall, road network, light poles and guardrooms were demolished.Bhath said that the illegal development of farmhouses on agricultural land or forest land will not be allowed. “Action will be taken against landowners and developers who are selling these properties to gullible buyers. A drone survey is already underway to identify such illegal structures in the district,” he said.According to the details shared by the department, demolition drives will be conducted on the outskirts of the city, particularly in Badhshahpur, Farrukhnagar and Manesar, this month to stop illegal constructions, especially illegal colonies.Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner (enforcement), said that they will also interact with buyers in these areas and make them aware of the futility of buying properties in illegal colonies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/illegal-farmhouse-colony-in-sohna-demolished-101629395640999.html
19-08-2021||Gurugram||OPD delay, staff absence main issues at Civil Hospital, finds chief officer during surprise check||Senior district health department officials found several shortcomings in the functioning of the Civil Hospital in Sector 10 during a surprise inspection on Thursday. Pointing at the delay in starting out-patient department (OPD) services and absence of staff at the registration counters, the chief medical officer said that explanations will be sought and warnings issued to doctors and staff over their lax behaviour in running the hospital.“During the inspection at 8.30am, we found that there was no one at the registration counter, which is at the entrance of the main hospital building. Only four doctors were present in the hospital at the time when OPD services had to start. Since many doctors were not present on time, OPDs started late by almost an hour and affected the functioning of the hospital. Even the hospital pharmacy was closed in the absence of the staff, and the landline number of the emergency ward was not operational,” said Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram. Except for super speciality departments, such as cardiology, neurology, and nephrology, Civil Hospital runs OPD for all departments, including medicine, surgery, Ear Nose Throat (ENT), eye and dental. Every day, the OPD registers a footfall of 1,000-1,500 patients. It is the only government hospital in the city after the main government hospital in Civil Lines was shut in 2019 for reconstruction. Several departments were shifted to the Sector 10 hospital, making it the main government-designated tertiary care centre. Since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, followed by vaccination, the hospital has been receiving a heavy footfall. Several improvised services, such as setting up oxygen plants and better bed management for Covid-19 patients, have also been undertaken. Yadav said that the purpose of the inspection was to see the routine functioning of the hospital as all health services have been resumed after the second wave of Covid-19. Refusing to give an exact count of staff and doctors who were not available during the working hours, Yadav said that appropriate action will be taken. According to him, calls were being made to doctors to seek explanations for their absence, due to which OPD could not be started on time. “The entire hospital services were hampered due to callousness of the hospital staff.

MS Malik, the chief conservator of forests for Gurugram circle, said that by planting fruit-bearing trees, the department is trying to develop habitats near urban areas as part of wildlife management.“We are planting trees such as jamun, peepal (sacred fig), gular (cluster fig), shahtoot (mulberry), pilkhan (white fig) and others that are beneficial for wildlife. Along with ensuring the availability of food, these trees have the potential to become homes for birds, monkeys and other small animals. This can also help reduce monkey conflict in the cities,” said Malik.Managing the population of monkeys in urban areas, especially Gurugram and Faridabad, has been difficult over the past few years with frequent attacks being reported by residents. In some instances, monkeys caused severe bruises and cuts. Earlier this month, two children in Sohna were injured in a monkey attack outside their house.Officials said that once these pockets are developed, they would also be able to release captured monkeys here, instead of releasing them in the Aravallis. Apart from Gurugram district, the plantation has also been carried out at two places in the Mahendragarh district.Environmentalists welcomed the move but said that a few such pockets would not solve the problem. “Planting fruit-bearing trees is definitely a good initiative and has good potential to manage man-animal conflict in the coming years, but this would help only when this is done on a large scale. Such plantations should be carried out near a cluster of sectors, as monkeys are found near the most common markets where food is easily available for them. This can also help increase the green cover of Gurugram that stands at 9% of its total area at present,” said Vaishali Chandra, a city-based environmentalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/green-pockets-with-fruit-bearing-trees-being-created-to-minimise-monkey-attacks-101629395582730.html

The government seems to have its eyes closed,” he said.Hooda said the way the state government hid the actual death toll due to coronavirus and lack of oxygen, it is clear that they are shy of facing the reality.“Today, unemployment, crime and inflation are at peak. Haryana is facing four times more unemployment (28.1%) than the country. Scams are being carried out in the name of employment and government recruitments,” he alleged.As per the list of business for Friday, the opening day of the assembly session will also see introduction of six amendment Bills.These are Haryana Management of Civic Amenities and Infrastructure Deficient Municipal Areas (Special Provisions) Amendment Bill, the Maharishi Balmiki Sanskrit University, Kaithal (Amendment)Bill, the Haryana Enterprises Promotion (Amendment) Bill, the Haryana Lokayukta (Amendment) Bill, Pandit Lakhmi Chand State University of Performing and Visual Arts, Rohtak (Amendment) Bill, and the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Haryana Amendment) Bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-assembly-session-begins-today-101629395096593.html

The court has also issued directions for a thorough investigation in this regard.Police have also booked two cops posted in the Economic Cell of the Kaithal police for not taking required action against the doctors when a complaint was filed against them in December last year.As per the FIR, complainant Jaipal had alleged that the doctor couple was posed as medical officers at the civil hospital and during their service in 2003 and they had prepared false attendance certificates by putting signatures of four the then sitting judges. They had even claimed travel allowances from the health department.Talking to HT, the complainant alleged that the couple got transferred to Punaha in 2003. To avoid joining duty there, they allegedly cited that they have to move court for regular hearings in different cases in Kaithal.Jaipal said last year he had filed an RTI application in the office of director general of health, Panchkula regarding records of attendance and as per the records, four judicial officers had reportedly disclosed in letters that some attendance certificates are not genuine.Based on the information, the complainant had moved a complaint to SHO Civil Lines police station and the office of the superintendent of police on December 3 last year for taking legal action and registering an FIR.The Kaithal SP had forwarded the complaint to the Economic Cell, Kaithal for taking necessary action. The investigation was conducted by sub-inspector Mohinder Singh and in-charge Economic Cell Devender Kumar Sharma.“But both the cops disposed off the complaint illegally without hearing the complainant as well as the judicial officers and misused their power,” Jaipal alleged.Now, an FIR is registered under Sections 409, 420, 467, 468, 471, 166-A and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the doctors and the cops. Kaithal SP Lokender Singh confirmed this and said no arrest has been made so far.Meanwhile, Dr BB Khakkar refuted the allegations and said the matter had already been investigated on several occasions and there is no evidence to prove the allegations levelled against them.He alleged that the complainant has some personal interests and is taking up this matter for publicity. The doctor claimed to have a copy of the recent investigation in the case conducted by DSP Vivek Chaudhary in which the DSP claimed that there is no criminal offence found in the probe.Also, in his investigation report, in-charge Economic Cell Devender Kumar Sharma had said that during probe, no evidence to prove the claims of false TA bills were found and there was no record related to the allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kaithal-doc-couple-booked-for-forging-attendance-certificates-signatures-of-the-then-sitting-judges-101629394916197.html

19-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Nashik enters Race to Zero campaign, to be carbon neutral by 2040||The state environment and climate change department on Thursday announced the entry of Nashik into the global ‘Race to Zero’ campaign, which was founded last December under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Nashik is the first non-metro city in India to join the global campaign to promote carbon neutrality, with Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and Aurangabad set to follow suit in the next couple of months, said officials privy to the development.The development follows an announcement made in April this year by state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, in a virtual meeting held with Climate Voices — a consortium of three independent environment groups operating in India. “Cities joining ‘Race to Zero’ will seek to prevent future climate threats, create jobs, and unlock equitable and sustainable growth. These cities must publicly acknowledge and recognise the global climate emergency, keeping climate resilience in line with urban decision making, pledging to reach net-zero (carbon emissions) in the 2040s or sooner,” Climate Voices had said in a statement at the time.The environment department in a statement on Thursday also said that Nashik has taken up nine “commitments” which will help it to attain ‘net zero’ status by the year 2040. These include developing ‘complete neighbourhoods’ across the city, where residents will be able to meet most of their needs within a short walk or bicycle ride from their homes, instead of having to travel longer distances using motor vehicles.Nashik also plans to enact regulations that make it mandatory for all new buildings and development projects to operate with net-zero carbon emissions by 2030. Under the Race to Zero initiative, the city will “develop financial support programs to incentivise the deployment of building-scale renewables and mandate the use of renewables through building codes,” the environment department said in a statement.Other commitments include establishing baseline levels of air pollutants to set reduction targets to meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. A plan to tackle emissions from the city’s largest contributors is expected to be in place by 2025. The next four years will also see the city attempt to adopt cleaner public transport, with a pilot program for zero-emission buses on the cards during the same period.The city plans to utilise grants to the tune of ₹20.5 Crore, received from the 15th Finance Commission, to reduce air pollution by constructing electric crematoriums and introducing sanitary waste management technologies for the Nashik Municipal Corporation, as unsanitary landfills contribute directly to climate change-associated emissions. “All waste generated in the city will be collected and residual waste will be disposed of adequately in an engineered sanitary landfill,” the environment department said.Commenting on these commitments, Nashik Municipal Corporation commissioner Kailas Jadhav said, “Reducing air pollution is a major step towards tackling climate change and adopting carbon neutrality. Under the Race to Zero initiative, NMC will have a much-needed platform that will support our best practices in that regard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-nashik-enters-race-to-zero-campaign-to-be-carbon-neutral-by-2040-101629393174325.html

Scientists Dr V M Bhandari and his group at CSIR-NCL Pune, with support from the DST, developed the hybrid technology that involves boiling of a liquid as a result of pressure reduction (cavitation), and also uses natural oils with antimicrobial properties. This technology can eliminate harmful bacteria, including antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. “Disinfection of water is essential for removing pathogenic microorganisms that are responsible for causing a number of water-borne diseases. However, the common drawbacks of chemical methods such as chlorination include formation of harmful and carcinogenic disinfection by-products. Therefore, it is pertinent to develop technology that provides safe and healthy drinking water at a low cost with substantial ease of operation, scalability, and without harmful by-products,” said Dr Bhandari.“The technique used hydrodynamic cavitation, combining chemistry, biology, and chemical engineering, along with natural resources in the form of natural oils and plant extracts. The process has resulted in increased efficiency and reduced cost of water treatment. It was observed that increased rates of disinfection using oil can drastically reduce the time of operation and consequently reduce cost as compared to other advanced treatment processes,” he added.SWASTIIK can have significant benefits in terms of providing safe water and also possible health benefits that can also boost immunity, an important aspect as underlined in the current pandemic times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ncl-scientists-develop-novel-hybrid-technology-to-disinfect-water-101629389693479.html

A notification issued by the state’s urban development department (UDD) on Wednesday said Anubhuti Shrivastava, currently posted as executive officer at Hajipur Nagar Parishad, has been suspended with immediate effect.The case dates back to June 18 last year, when Bajarang Bahadur Singh, former chief administrator (chairman) of Bhabua Nagar Parishad, filed a complaint with the district magistrate of Kaimur, seeking a probe into the alleged embezzlement by Shrivastava, contractual junior engineer Rahul Singh and other officials.In his complaint, Singh also enclosed documents related to the alleged embezzlement and assets acquired by Shrivastava disproportionate to his known sources of income, copies of which he also sent to the UDD. The DM formed a probe team which, in its report dated September 23, 2021, found that 504 schemes at an estimated cost of ₹39.71 crore were completed in financial years 2017-2018, 2018-2019 and 2019-20 during the three-year tenure of Shrivastava but tenders were issued only for 51 schemes. The probe report also highlighted gross irregularities in maintaining books and GST vouchers. The appointment of contractual junior engineer Rahul Singh was also found to have been made against rules.District magistrate Navdeep Shukla said the report was sent to the UDD last year for necessary action. HT has reviewed the copies of complaint and the probe report.After almost a year of no action, complainant Singh met CM Nitish Kumar in his Janata Darbar on Monday (August 16) and mentioned the matter. He also briefed the CM about alleged embezzlement of crores of rupees in Nagar Parishads of Jagadishpur and Dumaraon by Shrivastava during his earlier postings and for which the recommendations for probe and action were also pending with the UDD for long.The CM directed the director general of police (DGP) and the Vigilance department for an immediate probe, Singh said, thanking Kumar. Shrivastava could not be contacted for his comment despite repeated efforts as his mobile phone was always found switched off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/official-under-probe-for-scam-suspended-after-bihar-cm-steps-in-101629389634675.html
19-08-2021||Patna||Pandemic has deepened inequality in education: Nobel laureate||Nobel laureate Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee on Thursday said the biggest worry due to a Covid-19 pandemic is the widening gap of inequality in education, as online learning exposure as well as Internet penetration continue to be extremely low, more so in a state like Bihar.He was delivering the inaugural Manoj Srivastava memorial lecture. Manoj Srivastava, a senior IAS officer and a widely acclaimed academic, passed away last year. “Even during normal times, attendance in government schools remains a concern, hovering around 50% mark in most states, which results in poor learning outcome of students, as reflected through Annual Status of Education Report (ASER). Around 50% students in Class 5 cannot even do class 2 mathematics. This should frighten us. The pandemic has dealt another blow. The challenge for the country is to undo the widening gap of inequality in education, which has grown wider during pandemic,” he said. Recalling his association with the late IAS officer, Banerjee said the notion that private schools are better off was also misplaced. “We are a victim of tyranny of curriculum. Instead of teaching what the curriculum dictates, we should teach what the students need, as one class has students of different levels of understanding. It needs patience. The system is structured in such a way that it does not give opportunity to all. We must get out of the system of education developed for the colonial regime. It cannot be for the elite only,” he said.Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha dwelt on his old association with Srivastava and how the officer, due to his easy accessibility, nature to challenge hierarchy and desire to work for the masses and basic issues, had an impact on him. “With a whole spectrum of people here, one can easily get a feel of the imprint the officer has left,” he said.CPI-ML general secretary Deepankar Bhattacharya recalled how his party leadership, inspired by the work and approach of young Srivastava as Bhojpur district magistrate, sent him to the officer’s house with a request if he would like to contest election. Former union minister Akhilesh Prasad Singh of the Congress said he was always in touch with Srivastava for valuable advice on complex issues. Others who spoke on the occasion included Asian Development Bank vice-opresident and former Election Commissioner Ashok Lavasa, Bihar chief secretary Tripurari Sharan, Srivastava’s son Sagar Srivastava, who is an Indian Revenue Service officer, and several others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/pandemic-has-deepened-inequality-in-education-nobel-laureate-101629389514124.html

Singh, who was holding the tourism department, was removed last year due to rebellion against chief minister Ashok Gehlot. Singh’s son Anirudh submitted a complaint to the Superintendent of Police, Bharatpur, on Thursday alleging that the ‘core team’ of his father and Deeg–Kumher (Bharatpur) MLA Vishvendra Singh was continuously threatening him. “The threats are of extremely serious nature, threatening to cause all kinds of physical injuries to me and people who accompany me,” he alleged in the complaint. He further stated, “If any harm is done to me, the responsibility of the same would rest with Vishvendra Singh.” Superintendent of Police, Bharatpur Devendra Kumar said, “He has submitted a complaint in which he is mentioning some core team (of Vishvendra Singh), which allegedly is threatening him. The circle officer, Bharatpur city has been asked to probe the issue.” “The allegations made in the complaint are being probed. Based on the facts which come in the probe, the decision about registering the case will be taken accordingly,” he said. The MLA Vishvendra Singh could not be reached for comments as he did not respond to the calls. This is not the first case when Anirudh has come face to face with his father. Earlier, Anirudh Singh had tweeted against his father. The former minister was among the 19 MLAs who rebelled against the leadership of Gehlot in July last year, which had led to a political crisis. He, along with then deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and then food and civil supply minister Ramesh Meena, was terminated from the cabinet, following the rebelion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-congress-mla-s-son-alleges-threats-by-father-s-core-team-101629389341241.html

Going by the contractor’s estimate, the work will take another six months for completion,” Patil said.“It is one of the important projects in the city. With highway traffic and city traffic merging here, it creates more chaos. There are many accidents too. Union minister Nitin Gadkari has funded the project thus decreasing the financial burden of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). The project has been delayed mainly due to the land acquisition issue,” he said.After inspecting the site, Patil instructed that the potholes be cleared during night hours by keeping one lane closed. Accordingly, these craters are expected to be cleared within the next week. PMC officials and traffic police were among the authorities present during the site visit.According to PMC officials, some landowners moved court making it difficult to acquire land for the project. Still, the project hasn’t ground to a halt and nearly 90% of the land is in possession with the remaining 10% to be acquired soon. Some officials who did not wish to be named said that traffic speeds have dropped considerably owing to the rainy season, which is causing problems with potholes and even mud appearing in places along the route.Suggestions for improving the traffic situation at Chandani chowk:Increasing the number of traffic wardens to streamline trafficChannelising properly the vehicles coming from BavdhanClearing potholes during night hoursPushing the barricades behind to make more space for vehiclesSpeaking with landowners who went to court and helping get the land sooner for the flyover project||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-maha-chief-suggests-temporary-measures-to-ease-traffic-at-chandani-chowk-101629389336144.html

The PMC usually distributes the chemical free-of-cost to citizens to carry out immersion of Ganesh idols within their homes. The Ganesh idols are immersed in water mixed with the chemical which helps dissolve the Plaster of Paris (PoP) idols without causing any water- or environmental pollution.Earlier, municipal corporations would face pollution of rivers and other water bodies as thousands of Ganesh idols made of PoP were immersed on different days of the festival. Faced with similar problems, the PMC, with the help of the National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), found that if the idols were immersed in water mixed with Ammonium Bicarbonate, they dissolved and the resultant solution could be used to plant trees. Ever since, the PMC has been ordering the chemical ahead of the Ganesh festival and is getting good support from citizens with demand for it increasing year-on-year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-orders-50-lakh-of-ammonium-bicarbonate-for-ganesh-immersion-101629389274510.html

Congress leader Aba Bagul said, “In the name of revenue, the ruling party is selling PMC properties. Amenity spaces are plots or constructed areas reserved for gardens, hospitals, playgrounds, school or other civic amenities.Standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane said, “This decision will help increase revenue. By leasing out 270 amenity spaces, the civic body will earn  ₹1,753 crore.”Rasane said, “Due to Covid, the municipal corporation earned less. There is a need to search for new sources of income. PMC has a total of 732 amenity spaces in the city spread over 148.37 hectares. PMC already developed 585 amenity spaces. Now 147 amenity spaces remain on 19.31 hectares.”Rasane added, “As per the PMC policy, we can lease the properties for 30 years, but we will seek the general body’s permission to lease for 90 years.”Chavan said, “Amenity spaces are important. If these are leased out, there would be no open places and trees in the city. Citizens must come forward and oppose this decision.”Inquiry into outstanding duesStanding committee chairman Hemant Rasane has instructed the administration to conduct an inquiry into previously allotted amenity places and pending dues with said operators.Rasane said, “PMC had given various properties on lease. Till March 2021, total dues from 1,625 leased properties was  ₹34 crore.

Venting his ire, Tej Pratap tweeted, “The president forgot that the party runs by the constitution and the constitution of RJD says that without giving notice, you cannot remove any office-bearer of the party. What happened today was against the constitution of RJD.” “He owes an explanation for this,” he told a news channel on Thursday. Singh, a close aide of Lalu Prasad, shot back saying he is answerable only to the RJD chief. “Lalu Prasad is the president of RJD and no one else can ask him for clarification except him. Who is Tej Pratap?,” he said, adding that it was his responsibility to appoint RJD’s student wing president. “When I did not appoint anybody, where does the question of removal arise? I have appointed Gagan Kumar to this post,” he told reporters at RJD office in Patna on Thursday.Hours later, Tej Pratap threatened to lodge a court case against Singh for “violating” the party’s constitution and demanded that the party take action against him. “There is a concerted effort to demoralize youths in the party,” he said while talking to media persons on Thursday evening. He said he will discuss the matter with Tejashwi.“I will continue to fight unilateral decisions,” a visibly angry Tej Pratap said.The tension between Jagdanand Singh and Tej Pratap Yadav has been building up for some time. During a meeting of RJD’s student wing recently, Tej Pratap had used words like Hitler from the stage while referring to Singh.“There can be no Hitler in RJD. Words like Hitler have no place in the party. That’s why whatever someone says, I don’t pay attention to it,” Singh later said in response. “There are three people on constitutional posts in RJD, president Lalu Prasad, leader of Opposition Tejashwi Yadav and the state unit president (himself),” he said.Singh had stopped coming to the party office after Tej Pratap’s diatribe against him and even skipped the I-Day function at the party office. On Wednesday, he came to party office after having a closed-door meeting with Tejashwi Yadav and announced his decision to appoint a new youth wing president. On his part, Tejashwi, Lalu Prasad’s younger son and RJD’s heir apparent, sought to play down the war of words between his brother and the state president. “Everyone has their own opinion. When I am the leader of opposition and national president is Lalu ji, there is no problem. Everything will be fine soon,” he said. Meanwhile, the ruling Janata Dal (United) seized the opportunity to take a swipe at the rival party. “Tej Pratap is hurt because nobody in his party gives importance to him. It is a fight for the chair between the two brothers,” said JD(U) vice-president Sanjay Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/rjds-jagdanand-tej-pratap-clash-in-public-101629388851810.html

The PM has given time on August 23. Many thanks to him,” Kumar tweeted on Thursday.Earlier in the day, leader of Opposition, RJD’s Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, told reporters that the PM had given time to the CM and a representative of the Opposition alliance to meet him on August 23 at 11 am.“The Opposition has consistently raised the issue of caste-based census in the Bihar Legislative Assembly and two proposals were also unanimously passed by the House in the past,” said Tejashwi, who had also written to the PM on the need for caste-based census, after Kumar’s letter last month, seeking time for a meeting with all-party delegation on the issue.Earlier this week, Kumar had praised the Prime Minister for removing the confusion on state’s right to decide on other backward castes (OBCs) and said he was hopeful of getting him to discuss the matter related to caste-based census. His reference was to the 127th Constitution Amendment passed by Parliament in the monsoon session that concluded last week, which restores the rights of states to identify and maintain a list of backward classes.In 2011, socio-economic and caste census was done, though caste data could never be made public due to several discrepancies. The last caste census in the country was held in 1931. As per its projections for specific Hindu castes and the 1961 Census for all others, backward castes consisted of 51.3% population in the state.However, there is a widespread view among political parties that the numbers might have changed, and a fresh caste-based census is the need of the hour. In this regard, both the Houses of the Bihar Legislature had passed a resolution in 2020 also, while the Legislative Assembly passed a second resolution also.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/caste-census-pm-agrees-to-meet-cm-led-bihar-delegation-on-aug-23-101629388612883.html

The project only takes inspiration from Amritsar, but will have its own unique identity. Under the preliminary plan, three streets leading to the gurdwara from the Qila Mubarak (royal fort), the Garg Chowk and the Jain School will be given a retro look. This will decongest the area around the gurdwara, as these roads will be pedestrian only, with no traffic allowed to ply. The front street of the Qila Mubarak will also be part of the project. The council, which is funding the project, has asked its engineers from the buildings and roads branches to conduct a survey and prepare a blueprint of the appearance of the streets, and an estimate of the expenditure required. All shops will also be renovated in a similar pattern to create an atmosphere of spirituality. Wires around the street will also be taken underground to give a clear view of the gurdwara and other historic buildings.History shows that Sufi saint Baba Farid stopped by the city known as Mokhalhar (now Faridkot) in early 13th century and sat in isolation for 40 days near the fort of the King Mokhalhar. The king was impressed by his divinity and named the city after him. The place where Baba Farid sat is known as Tila Baba Farid.  Faridkot municipal council president Narinder Singh said, “Our engineers have started working on the plan and a proposal will be sent to local bodies department director for approval soon. We have sufficient funds to complete this project. After the approval, we will float tenders. We hope the project to be completed by the first quarter of 2022. It will be completely different from the Heritage Street,” he said. Deputy commissioner Vimal Kumar Setia said, “This is our ambitious project to protect and conserve ancient history linked to Baba Farid and Faridkot. The Heritage Street is only a start, later we plan to restore the three historical gates of Faridkot and the Clock Tower, that the Faridkot Maharaja had built over a century ago.” Faridkot MLA Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon said, “Building a Heritage Street is my dream project now. Baba Farid has blessed this city and people.The project is our tribute to him.” Maheepinder Singh, caretaker, Baba Farid Trust, which manages the historic gurdwara said the project was a welcome development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/heritage-street-planned-around-historic-baba-farid-gurdwara-in-faridkot-101629387653456.html

Mali had made references to J&K on Facebook on August 17; protesters claimed that this amounted to sedition. Led by state BJYM in-charge Rajesh Honey and state president Bhanu Partap, the activists planned to gherao Sidhu’s residence in Holy City, a private township. Police, however, stopped them at the entrance to the complex by installing barricades and locking the main gate. The youth workers tried to break the barricading, but police took some of them into preventive custody to defuse the situation. “Mali must be tried under sedition for his anti-national view on J&K,” claimed BJYM district president Gautam Arora. “Every Indian will be enraged to see the post of Mali, as he doesn’t consider J&K to be an integral part of the country. It also shows that Sidhu in inclined towards Pakistan. Sidhu supports Pakistani extremists and separatists of Kashmir. He must tender an apology to the country,” claimed Arora.In the confrontation between the police and BJYM, the youth wing of the BJP, the protesters raised slogans against the Congress and Sidhu. Partap added that they would hold state-wide protests against Sidhu and Mali. In his interactions with the media, Mali has maintained that nothing was wrong in his social media post on J&K.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjymprotests-against-ppcc-chief-sidhu-over-adviser-s-comment-on-jk-101629386812230.html

The CM made this announcement while distributing ₹42.03 crore cash awards to all Tokyo-returned medal winners of India and others at a felicitation ceremony at the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Stadium here on Thursday. It was another honour for Dhyan Chand, who was regarded as one of the greatest in the history of hockey, after winning three gold medals for India at the Olympics. “To give sports a fillip, the state government has decided to name UP’s proposed sports university at Meerut after Major Dhyan Chand, whose contribution to Indian sports is immense,” said the CM. The government had also decided to adopt two sporting disciplines, including wrestling for the next 10 years. The government would take care of everything in these two disciplines and its athletes, he said. Laying emphasis on Prime Minister Modi’s vision of ‘Khelo India Khelo’, the CM said as per the request of the Wrestling Federation of India, the state government had decided to open an international standard academy of wrestling in the state capital. Yogi, who met each medalist during the ceremony, also announced a hike in UP sportspersons’ diet money from ₹250 to ₹375 per day, bringing it at par with the diet money plan of the Sports Authority of India. He also announced a hike in the cash awards to medal winning athletes of Uttar Pradesh in future international events like the Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and World Championships. “We also have plans to appoint medal-winning athletes at the top level (Olympics, Commonwealth Games and Asian Games) on gazzetted posts, including that of deputy SPs, in various government departments,” the CM added. However, he did not make any direct promise of any specific jobs to any of UP awardees on the dais, but said that the government had decided to create new job opportunities in the UP Sports Directorate against the vacant posts of regional sports officers, sports officers and deputy sports officers. The CM also mentioned about schemes like creating a playground in every village and open gym at every gram panchayat level. “It’s a Kumbh of sports and sportspersons here today and we all should celebrate this occasion. The UP government will continue its support to sports and sportspersons,” he added. Governor Anandiben Patel too lauded the congregation of medal-winning sportspersons at the ceremony. “Success of our athletes at the Tokyo Olympics will surely motivate parents in the country to push their wards to follow the footsteps of Neeraj Chopra, who is India’s torch-bearer in sports.” All the dignitaries on the dais, including governor Anandiben Patel and CM Yogi Adityanath, were presented with special hockey sticks and other mementoes by the officials of the Indian Olympic Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/meeruts-sports-univ-to-be-named-after-major-dhyan-chand-says-up-cm-101629386698147.html

Deshmukh claimed that the Supreme Court accepted his plea on the ED and said that it would be heard soon. The top court had on Monday refused to grant interim relief to Deshmukh, even as he was seeking protection from any ‘coercive action’ in connection with the money laundering case.A three-judge bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar said Desmukh is at liberty to access remedies available to him under the law, after he filed a batch of petitions against a few charges of ED.Deshmukh said the apex court allowed him to move a lower court to seek legal remedy. "The legal process has begun and I will appear before the ED after they are completed. I will cooperate with the ED. I have always followed high standards in my entire social-political life," he was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.ALSO READ | Maharashtra: The travails of former home minister Anil DeshmukhThe ED had earlier issued summons to Deshmukh in connection with a criminal case registered under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) related to an alleged ₹100 crore bribery and extortion racket, which forced the 71-year-old to step as Maharashtra’s home minister in April.Deshmukh skipped appearing before the ED for the fifth time on Wednesday and had stated that he was taking recourse to "lawful remedies" for the protection of his liberty. According to PTI, he had a three-page reply to the investigating officer of the case. He said the Supreme Court made it available for him to take recourse to remedies available under the CrPC, including filing of a quashing petition.The NCP leader requested the agency to record his statement through an electronic medium, till the time any court passes “appropriate orders.”The ED lodged the case against Deshmukh and others following the Central Bureau of Investigation filing a corruption case over the alleged bribery charges, made by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh.After he was ousted as the police chief, Singh had written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray alleging that Deshmukh had asked suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Waze to “extort over ₹100 crore a month from bars and restaurants” in Mumbai. Deshmukh, who resigned from his post in April following the allegations, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/anil-deshmukh-enforcement-directorate-pmla-case-maharashtra-supreme-court-101629385000928.html
19-08-2021||Mumbai||‘SC accepted my petition against ED; will appear once legal recourse is completed’: Anil Deshmukh||After skipping multiple summons issued by the Enforcement Directorate in the alleged money laundering case, former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Thursday issued a statement saying that the Supreme Court has accepted his petition against ED action which is expected to be heard very soon. The apex court has also given him the liberty to appeal in the lower court and he will appear before the ED after completing legal recourse.“The Supreme Court has accepted my petition against the Enforcement Directorate’s action and is expected to hear the same very soon. The apex court also allowed me to appeal in the lower court. Once the process of legal recourse is completed, I will appear before the Enforcement Directorate and extend full cooperation. In my entire political and social life, I have always followed high standards,” said Deshmukh in a statement released on Thursday.On Wednesday, the senior NCP leader skipped the summons issued by the ED in connection with the allegations of corruption and extortion against him. It was the fifth summons issued by the central investigation agency on Tuesday. The ED had issued fresh summons a day after the top court refused to grant any interim relief to Deshmukh.The ED has registered a money laundering case against Deshmukh after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a first information report (FIR) against him on April 21. So far, Deshmukh has maintained that the allegations against him are false.The central agency has alleged that while serving as the Maharashtra home minister, Deshmukh misused his position, and through assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze – who has now been dismissed and is in Taloja jail for his alleged role in the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran murder case – collected ₹4.7 crore from Mumbai’s bars for their “smooth functioning”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sc-accepted-my-petition-against-ed-will-appear-once-legal-recourse-is-completed-anil-deshmukh-101629384652523.html

Ludhiana civil surgeon Dr Kiran Ahluwalia said a 59-year-old woman from the Old City area died due to swine flu at a private hospital on Wednesday.Swine flu is a contagious respiratory infection caused by an influenza virus strain that starts from pigs. Its major symptoms are fever, cough, sore throat, chills, weakness and body ache. Children, pregnant women and the elderly are at higher risk of contracting the disease.“The woman, of a colony near the Laxmi Cinema area, was brought to the Dayanand Medical College and Hospital a week ago, following symptoms of swine flu. She was cremated on Wednesday following protocols related to swine flu,” said the civil surgeon, adding that a high alert had been sounded and area around her house has been cordoned off. The health department has started prophylactic (preventive) treatment of the woman’s daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren. The department has also advised people to stay away from densely populated areas if they are suffering from flu-like symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-sees-first-swine-flu-death-in-over-two-years-101629383209338.html

Nashik is the first non-metro city in India to join the global campaign to promote carbon neutrality, with Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and Aurangabad set to follow suit in the next couple of months, said officials privy to the development.The development follows an announcement made in April this year by state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, in a virtual meeting held with Climate Voices - a consortium of three independent environment groups operating in India. “Cities joining ‘Race to Zero’ will seek to prevent future climate threats, create jobs, and unlock equitable, sustainable growth. These cities must publicly acknowledge and recognise the global climate emergency, keeping climate resilience in line with urban decision making, pledging to reach net zero (carbon emissions) in the 2040s or sooner,” Climate Voices said in a statement.The environment department in a statement on Thursday also said that Nashik has taken up nine “commitments” which will help it to attain ‘net zero’ status by the year 2040. These include developing ‘complete neighbourhoods’ across the city, where residents will be able to meet most of their needs within a short walk or bicycle ride from their homes, instead of having to travel longer distances using motor vehicles.Nashik also plans to enact regulations that make it mandatory for all new buildings and development projects to operate with net zero carbon emissions by 2030. Under the Race to Zero initiative, the city will “develop financial support programs to incentivise the deployment of building-scale renewables and mandate the use of renewables through building codes,” the environment department said in a statement.Other commitments include establishing baseline levels of air pollutants to set reduction targets to meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. A plan to tackle emissions from the city’s largest contributors is expected to be in place by 2025. The next four years will also see the city attempt to adopt cleaner public transport, with a pilot program for zero-emission buses on the cards during the same period.The city plans to utilise grants to the tune of ₹20.5 crore, received from the 15th Finance Commission, to reduce air pollution by constructing electric crematoriums and introducing sanitary waste management technologies for the Nashik Municipal Corporation, as unsanitary landfills contribute directly to climate change-associated emissions. “All waste generated in the city will be collected and residual waste will be disposed of adequately in an engineered sanitary landfill,” the environment department said.Commenting on these commitments, Nashik Municipal Corporation commissioner Kailas Jadhav said, “Reducing air pollution is a major step towards tackling climate change and adopting carbon neutrality. Under the Race to Zero initiative, NMC will have a much-needed platform that will support our best practices in that regard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nashiks-9-commitments-to-attain-carbon-neutral-status-by-2040-101629378285880.html
19-08-2021||Lucknow||‘Best-ever support to Indian athletes by any state govt’||LUCKNOW The event organized by the Yogi Adityanath-led UP government to felicitate Tokyo-returned sporting icons of India was big and grand in every way. All medalists looked mesmerized by the hospitality extended to them at the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium here on Thursday. Two giant screens showed the footage of India’s golden boy Neeraj Chopra, who created history by bagging India’s first-ever gold medal in athletics. This wasn’t all. Clips of PV Sindhu’s stellar performance in the badminton court, fine display of skills by wrestlers Ravi Kumar Dahiya, Bajrang Punia and others like Mirabai Chanu and Lovlina Borgohain entertained the 10,000-odd young athletes who came here from all parts of UP to witness the felicitation ceremony. Colourful dance performances by troupes of various cultural and traditional organizations in and outside the stadium and well-decorated carts to ferry the medalists from the entrance to the main stage were among the highlights of the event. Fans were seen chasing Chopra and Sindhu most for their autographs and selfies with them. Besides chief minister Yogi Adityanath Singh, governor Anandiben Patel, deputy chief ministers Dinesh Sharma and Keshav Prasad Maurya gave away the awards to the medalists. UP information department’s special video titled ‘Sashakt Yuva, Sashakt Pradesh’ drew applause from the athletes and young fans. Neeraj Chopra was given the biggest purse of ₹2 crore, followed by silver medalists – wrestler Ravi Kumar Dahiya and weightlifter Mirabai Chanu ( ₹1.5 crore each) while bronze medalists – wrestler Bajrang Punia and boxer Lovlina Borgohain got ₹1 crore each. Wrestler Deepak Punia and golfer Aditi Ashok were given ₹50 lakh each.The 32 members of both the men’s and women’s hockey teams were given ₹50 lakh each. The men’s hockey team won bronze while their women counterparts finished fourth at the Tokyo Games.In a special gesture, Vijay Sharma, the coach of Mirabai Chanu, was given ₹10 lakh, whereas the hockey teams’ staff members too were given ₹10 lakh each. Varanasi’s Lalit Kumar Upadhyay, who was part of India’s men’s hockey team, was given ₹1.25 crore, whereas women’s team player and Meerut’s Vandana Katariya was given ₹75 lakh. As promised by the state government, eight athletes from Uttar Pradesh, who participated at the Tokyo Games, but couldn’t make a podium finish, were also given ₹25 lakh each as a token of appreciation. They included walk-racer Priyanka Goswami, javelin thrower Shivpal Singh, shooter Saurabh Chaudhary, Mairaj Ahmed Khan, boxer Satish Kumar, sailor Arvind Singh, discus thrower Seema Punia and javelin thrower Annu Rani. Shooter Chaudhary, Mirabai Chanu and her coach Vijay Sharma skipped the event for personal reasons. Neeraj Chopra, in his brief but impressive address, was amazed to see such a huge gathering for Indian athletes on Thursday. “I was running around the stadium all alone after winning the gold medal at Tokyo. But today, I felt the real crowd support. It looks like a ceremony of India, not only of UP.” “I can see many more Neerajs sitting in the spectators’ gallery and I wish that one day some of them would surely be winning medals for UP,” Chopra said after he was cheered by young athletes from the spectators’ gallery. Ace shuttler PV Sindhu, who won her second Olympic medal at Tokyo after a silver at the Rio Olympics in 2016, admired the UP government for holding such a grand felicitation ceremony for Olympic medalists. “This is the best-ever support given by the any state government to the athletes of India. I wish that such things would continue to inspire Indian athletes to win more medals in the future Olympics,” she said. Other athletes like women’s hockey captain Rani Rampal, hockey player Lalit Kumar Upadhyay, Lovlina Borgohain, Ravi Dahiya, Bajrang Punia, men’s hockey captain Manpreet Singh also shared their experiences at the Tokyo Games. Manpreet said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s words a day before the bronze-medal game were very inspirational. “We were disappointed after losing the semi-finals, but the PM’s words made a big difference and we could create history.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bestever-support-by-any-state-govt-to-athletes-of-india-101629377329354.html

We will ensure such incidents don’t happen in the future,” said Dhurb Singh Martolia, sub-divisional officer, Terai-central forest division in Kumaon.A female elephant and a calf were killed on Wednesday after being hit by a train on Lalkuan-Kashipur route. Railway traffic was disrupted for 5 hours after the incident due to furious elephants.The forest department has booked Vijay Chand, loco pilot of the train under Wildlife Protection Act, Martolia said.He said joint patrol will be conducted by forest and railway officials at night to avoid such incidents in the future. “Besides this, the forest department has received a letter from divisional railway manager (DRM), Bareilly about the fixation of the speed limit of the train plying in the region,” he said.Martolia said, “Joint patrolling of forest and railway officials will be conducted at night to avoid such incidents. Besides this, trains will ply at the speed of 30-km/hour at night and 50 km/hour during the day.”In August 2018, while expressing serious concern over the death of elephants in train hit incidents, Uttarakhand high court had directed the union railway ministry to construct underpasses in the identified elephant corridors in the state and ensured that the speed of the trains should be the lowest possible while they are passing through elephant corridors in the state.The court had given these directions while hearing public interest litigation regarding encroachments around Corbett Tiger Reserve. The HC had also directed the forest department to coordinate with the railway department through wireless and having an animal tracking system in place to ensure wild animals are not killed in rail hits. The division bench also remarked that officials should have compassion while dealing with matters related to the wildlife in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-loco-pilot-booked-for-death-of-two-elephants-in-train-hit-incident-101629376248295.html

Bansal has alleged flagrant violations of the Wildlife Protection Act and Forest Conservation Act in CTR. Bansal in his legal notice has alleged that illegal construction of bridges and wall is happening in Corbett near Kalagarh Forest Rest House. Gaurav Bansal said he sent a legal notice to member secretary NTCA to draw his attention to two issues-illegal construction of bridges and wall and illegal felling of trees and shrubs within CTR. “Within Kalagarh and Pakhro area of the Corbett Tiger Reserve, forest officials are illegally constructing bridges. Near Kalagarh Forest Rest House, Uttarakhand Forest Department is not only illegally allowing construction of around four bridges but it is also constructing a high wall at the boundary of Corbett Tiger Reserve,” he said. Bansal said he has also come to know that all the materials needed for these constructions except cement are being sourced from CTR itself resulting in illegal mining of the natural resources and the same is causing an irreparable and irreversible loss and damage to the rich biological diversity of the Corbett landscape. “Illegal construction of bridges and wall has been done by the Uttarakhand forest department at the cost of trees and shrubs which constitute an essential part of the ecology, flora and fauna of Corbett Landscape,” he said. Bansal said according to Supreme Court order in “Navin M Raheja Vs. Union of India and Others (1998)”, the apex court has not only stayed the construction of any kind of road within the CTR but also expressly observed that no tree whatsoever should be felled in CTR by the state or anyone else. “These illegal constructions of bridges and wall by way of felling the trees and shrubs within the Corbett Tiger Reserve by the forest department is nothing but unsustainable use of Corbett landscape which is not only capable of damaging the ecology of the Tiger Reserve but shall also cause harm to the pristine biological diversity of the Corbett National Park,” he said. Bansal said through his legal notice, he has urged the NTCA to use its power under relevant sections of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 and as such disallow the ecologically unsustainable use of Corbett Landscape by way of evaluating and assessing the harm caused by these illegal construction activities. Director CTR Rahul (who goes by his first name) also wrote a letter to DFO Kalagarh forest division last month, seeking details of constructions/renovations going between Kalagarh to Pakhro, why was he not informed about such constructions, whether permissions had been sought for the constructions and who was funding the constructions. When contacted, Rahul, director CTR said they are looking into the matter and will soon send a status report to the NTCA. Corbett Tiger Reserve, which is spread across 1,288 square kilometres, is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the state. The gates of Corbett open on November 15 every year for six months till mid-June. Corbett witnesses a footfall of around 300,000 tourists every year. There are 231 tigers inside CTR and 266 using the reserve according to the latest report on tigers. This is the highest number of tigers across 50 tiger reserves in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ntca-seeks-reports-on-illegal-constructions-in-corbett-101629375468006.html
19-08-2021||Chandigarh||Remembering Rajiv, a man of vision and values||He would have turned 77 today. The accidental, reluctant and young Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, piloted the destiny of India during the tumultuous ’80s. The beginning of his political innings was traumatic and the end tragic. But he showed exemplary equanimity and dignity and infused new confidence in the life of the nation. I’m fortunate to have worked with him closely. In essence, he was charismatic as former US President John F Kennedy and an idealist like his grandfather and former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. He was keen to be perceived as a break from the past. He symbolised a change in the arena of politics, economy and morality in public life, through consent and conciliation, participation and persuasion. He was a determined peacemaker and worked hard to put an end to agitations and violations in Punjab, Assam, Mizoram, Nagaland and Kashmir to restore peace and democracy. Ironically, he fell victim to the violence that he fought throughout his life. Countering mayhem at Meham He described India as an old country but a young nation. He did everything to save and strengthen democratic systems as a passionate patriot and democrat. I vividly recollect that early in 1990 during the Meham byelection, democracy was being trampled upon through rigging and intimidation by then chief minister Om Prakash Chautala, who was seeking election to the Vidhan Sabha to retain his chief ministership. Rajiv, along with a young Rahul, visited the house of Anand Singh Dangi, an independent candidate, where three people were killed in police firing. He stood with the people. Consequent to his visit, Chautala had to resign on May 22, 1990. This is an irony of history that Rajiv visited Meham on May 20, 1990, to fight violence exactly a year before his assassination on May 21, 1991. Rajiv chose me as a candidate in the 10th Lok Sabha elections from Rohtak of which Meham is one of the nine segments, to oppose Devi Lal, the then deputy prime minister, who was trounced not once but thrice in three consecutive elections. But alas! Rajiv was no more to see the election result after which the Congress formed the governments in Haryana and at the Centre. Curbing corruption, opportunism To check corruption and political opportunism, he got the 52nd Constitution Amendment Act, 1955, commonly known as the anti-defection Act, passed within months of taking over. It provided for disqualification of an elected member of legislature on the grounds of defection to another political party. It was amended subsequently through the 91st Constitution Amendment Act, 2003. Though attempts are being made to circumvent the provision of this law, yet the measure has succeeded to a large extent. To make democracy broad-based and to harness the emerging advantage of India’s demographic dividend, Rajiv reduced the voting age from 21 to 18 years. Undoubtedly, the idealism and energy of youngsters have changed the political dynamics of the country forever. Decentralisation of democracy Moved by poverty in the rural areas of Kalahandi, Rajiv famously said that of every rupee spent by the government, only 15 paise reaches the beneficiary. He realised that the decentralisation of democracy at the grassroot level was imperative. He decided to revitalise the framework of panchayati raj institutions. He included the setting up of panchayati raj institutions in the Congress manifesto in the 1991 Lok Sabha elections. The Congress government fulfilled its dream by enacting the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendment Acts that enjoin the states to establish three-tier panchayats and municipalities in the rural and urban areas, respectively. Expanding higher education Education is the most critical weapon in building a nation. Rajiv established the ministry of human resource development in 1985 to modernise and expand higher education. He conceived the concept of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas, the free, residential schools for providing quality education to talented children of the rural areas. The first Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya was opened in Jhajjar district, a part of my constituency. At present, there are 660 JNVs. Architect of digital India Rajiv is rightly acclaimed as the architect of digital India. The seeds of information technology and telecom revolutions were planted by him. Several institutions such as MTNL, BSNL and C-DOT were established to spread the communication network. He launched institutions to liberate the mind, the economy and culture by infusing the dynamism of youngsters and changed India forever. His memory is eternally etched in the hearts and minds of the people of India.

19-08-2021||Chandigarh||Soul food: A humble bowl of rajma chawal||The words of Irish author George Bernard Shaw would resonate with any food connoisseur, “There is no love sincerer than the love of food.” Shaw isn’t the first to have made this observation, nor will he be the last, for the annals of history bear testimony to the undisputable actuality that man’s intellect has been dominated by his digestive organs. As a Punjabi, I could not agree more, for having lived a considerable part of my life in a state where the words of a Punjabi song resonate, “Khao, piyo, aish karo mitron…”, the essence of my Punjabiyat lies in my plenary indulgence for gluttony. My epicurean escapades with the rajma chawal, a North Indian household staple, during my college days bring back the good times spent in hostels and cooperative messes. At a time when Zomato and Swiggy were unheard of, the mobile phone device a reality whose existence we were only familiar with through electronic journals, this simple meal was an emotion, our go-to source for gastronomic delight. Due respect was accorded to this dish by our hostel mess chef, for we would be greeted by its aroma thrice a week, every morsel laden with his Himachali expertise. Leaders of the free world can perhaps take inspiration from how this humble dish played an instrumental role in promoting peace, for the heavy meal would bring out the best in our characters, eliciting in us the feeling of contentedness, forgiveness and generosity. A common post-rajma chawal complication was the laborious effort in trying not to doze off during after lunch lectures. Notoriously labelled as ‘suicidal sessions’, these lectures of engineering and mechanical drawing were subjects that mandated rapt attention. As one struggled to stay up, the monotonous drone of our professors serving as lullabies, one finally understood the essence of the lines, “We are but the verist, sorriest slaves of our stomach.” Fast-forward to days of portion control and healthy dieting, and a look back at the Herculean quantities of rajma chawal we consumed back then astound me. The memories of those good times linger however to this day, especially when I attend gatherings or meetings where I’m forced to restrict my consumption of this wholesome meal. So, while boiled vegetables and low-calorie foods may keep the weighing machine in check, in times of homesickness, a low phase or in the unforeseen event of being left by your beloved, there comes to mind only one soul food to make things better again, a humble bowl of rajma chawal. rarabhandari@gmail.com The writer is a Punjab-cadre IAS officer||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/soul-food-a-humble-bowl-of-rajma-chawal-101629373665438.html

On Tuesday, health minister Keshab Mahanta appealed to those persons who are due to get their second dose of either Covishield of Covaxin to come forward and get vaccinated. “We have tried a lot to bring those people to vaccination centres. We have telephoned them, set up call centres in each district. But still a lot of people whose second doses are due are not turning up. I don’t know why,” he said. “Some of them may have got their second doses elsewhere and we might not be aware of it. I would appeal to media outlets to urge people to come and get their doses,” added Mahanta. Also Read | Security beefed up in Darashing Hill near Assam-Mizoram border after fresh firingThe minister said that while 51% of all eligible persons above 18 years had got their first doses, only 11% of beneficiaries had taken their second doses. Both numbers, however, are higher than the national figures of 32% of total eligible beneficiaries administered with the first dose and 9% with second dose. Till Thursday morning, 14.98 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine had been administered in the state. Of them, 12.36 million people had taken their first doses, while 2.61 million people were fully vaccinated or had their second doses. Mahanta informed that nearly 250,000 to 300,000 doses of vaccines are being administered daily in the state at present and there is adequate supply to vaccinate all eligible persons. According to director, health services (family welfare) Munindra Nath Ngatey, over 270,000 persons who had got their first dose are scheduled to get their second dose in the next few days. As per existing guidelines, those given Covishield have to take their second dose between 84 and 112 days after taking the first dose. On the other hand, the gap between first and second dose of Covaxin is 28 days. “If the gap exceeds 112 days, it is considered overdue. It is possible that sometimes people might forget when the date of their second dose is due,” said S Lakshmanan, director, National Health Mission (NHM), Assam. According to union health ministry guidelines, persons who get infected with Covid-19 after taking their first dose can take the second dose three months after recovering from symptoms of the disease. “There could be some persons infected with Covid-19 after their first doses, but the number of such beneficiaries is very less and not a cause of concern,” said Lakshmanan. In order to encourage more people to get both their first and second doses, the health department is conducting awareness drives in all districts. Officials are using electoral rolls to find out if all beneficiaries above 18 years have turned up for their vaccine doses. Door to door campaigns to vaccinate all eligible persons have also started in some parts of Kamrup (metropolitan) district, which includes Guwahati. At present there are nearly 2,000 vaccination centres across the state. As per health officials, Assam has an eligible population of 23.7 million who are above 18 years of age.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/assam-authorities-worried-at-lukewarm-response-to-second-covid-vaccine-dose-101629372465393.html
19-08-2021||Jaipur||Vasundhara Raje back on BJP posters in Rajasthan||After long bickering in state BJP, former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje has returned on party posters. Cabinet minister Bhupendra Yadav’s Jan Ashirwad Yatra has included Raje on the posters, putting an end to the poster row which was going on for the last several months. Not only has she returned but has also been given prominence as she has been placed centrally in the poster released by the BJP for the Yatra, along with party state president Satish Poonia and Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria on her flanks. Other than PM Narendra Modi, national party chief JP Nadda, state incharge Arun Singh, Raje Poonia, and Kataria, the Yatra posters also bear photos of three Union ministers from Rajasthan – Gajendra Singh, Arjun Ram Meghwal and Kailash Choudhary. Over the development, a party MLA on anonymity commented that this must have been done on directions of Bhupendra Yadav as he always has balanced things. But her inclusion in the poster is not alone, three more faces have been added. A party office-bearer said the Yatra is a central program and accordingly all senior leaders’ photos, including that of Raje, and other ministers in GoI, are there on the posters. A controversy and war of words had erupted between state BJP workers and Raje’s supporters after photos of Raje were removed from the state’s party posters in state capital Jaipur around two months ago. Even during the last assembly by-polls on three seats, her photo was missing from hoarding and posters. At Rajsamand, the posters did have her photo but not at all places. A BJP leader had then stated that they are following the protocol and photos of only the CM, the leader of the opposition, and the state party chief can be used. Raje, who never commented on the development, recently broke her silence for the first time, saying, “I don’t believe in politics of posters, but want to dwell in people’s hearts and intend to carry out such works that remain their memory.” Meanwhile, Union labour minister Bhupendra Yadav on Thursday began his Jan Ashirwad Yatra in Congress-ruled Rajasthan from Alwar district where he addressed a public gathering and highlighted the achievements of the central government. The yatra began from Alwar bypass in Bhiwadi. He was received by the party leaders and workers, thereafter the yatra moved to the party office in Bhiwadi. He addressed the gathering there and said that the government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is transforming India into ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’. He also targeted the Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan saying there is a fight between Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot over the chair (chief ministership). He also exuded confidence that the party will form the next government in the state. After the address, he resumed the onward journey in a specially designed vehicle. Yadav, along with Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Shekhawat, state president Satish Poonia, deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Rathore and other leaders, was mounted on the vehicle painted in saffron colour. The yatra was escorted by party workers on a motorcycle by a large number of cars and other vehicles were also part of the yatra which is scheduled to reach Jaipur by evening. He will cover Jaipur district on Friday and Ajmer on Saturday. Senior Congress leader Archana Sharma said BJP is daydreaming that they will come into power in Rajasthan. She said what ashirwad (blessing) are they seeking? “People died due to a shortage of oxygen and inflation is uncontrollable,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/vasundhara-raje-back-on-bjp-posters-in-rajasthan-101629372167386.html

The state has recorded 23-25 such cases so far, and as an added precaution the government has started screening all Covid-19 recovered patients for TB, Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar told news agency ANI on Thursday.“As a precautionary measure, we have thought of conducting TB screening for all Covid-19 recovered persons,” he added.Sudhakar informed the Vidhana Soudha on Wednesday that over 28 lakh recoveries have been reported in the state so far and since both coronavirus and TB affect the lungs a special drive has been launched to help detect TB early.“There are more than 28 lakh people in the state who have recovered from the Covid-19 infection. Since both Covid-19 and TB infect the lungs, we have launched a special drive to ensure early detection of TB in people who have recovered from the virus," he said.“People who have recovered from Covid-19 should voluntarily get themselves evaluated for TB. If it is detected at an early stage the treatment will become easier", Sudhakar added.India has seen a fall of 25% in the number of TB cases reported in 2020 as compared to the previous year, the Union health ministry said in the Lok Sabha during the monsoon session. According to the official figures presented by the ministry in the lower house, India reported 1.8 million TB cases between January and December 2020 as compared to 2.4 million the year before.Fear of contracting the virus and closure of out-patient clinics due to the pandemic impacted screening and testing measures, a fact which Sudhakar himself reiterated in the assembly on Wednesday. It remains to be seen what impact this will have on the Prime Minister’s vision of ushering in a TB-free India by 2025.The ministry of science and technology announced on Wednesday that researchers from Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa — all of whom belong to the group of 24 countries recognised by the World Health Organisation as the countries with the highest caseload of TB —will be studying the impact of Covid-19 on epidemiological characteristics of TB infection and search for mechanisms responsible for the interaction of these two processes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/covid19-recovered-patients-in-karnataka-afflicted-with-tuberculosis-state-to-step-up-screening-measures-101629369880649.html
19-08-2021||Other||Taste of Life: When (and why) the misal was Pune’s steak... served very rare||VN Natu, the chronicler of Pune and the author of the delightful book “Aadhich Pune Gulzar”, was 14 when one of his uncles took him to a restaurant serving misal. The year was 1942 and the month, March. The Second World War had extended to the China– Burma– India theatre. The Air Raid Precautions law had been implemented and several citizens, like one Mr Thakur who sold bhel in Sadashiv Peth, were arrested for not obeying the orders. Pune had been experiencing frequent “brown-outs”, and mock drills to train the population in an event of a bombing were a routine. There was a talk of an impending “black-out”. Natu and his uncle went to a restaurant in Shukrawar peth. They did not enter through the main door facing the road. Most of the restaurants those days had back doors to facilitate patrons who did not wish to be seen entering the premises. Once seated, the uncle ordered misal for both of them.This was Natu’s first visit to a restaurant. His uncle too had never been inside one. They had never tasted misal. The purpose of this visit was not limited to eating misal. They were not there to enjoy the taste and appreciate the texture of the dish. They were there because the uncle believed that eating misal would equip them in fighting the British. They wanted to eat misal because they wanted to be strong and “masculine”.The notion that some dishes were “masculine”, while others were “feminine” was brought to India in the late 19th century. While several ancient Indian manuals and treatises on medicine prescribed foods for vigour and strength, they never classified them as “masculine” and “feminine”. The myth that certain foods and dishes were “masculine”, and one needed to devour those for strength was traceable to the intersection of colonialism, white supremacy, domesticity, and masculinity.The idea that some foods were more appropriate for women started to emerge in 19th-century Europe and the US after more and more women started joining the workforce. The corporate advertising machinery demarcated male and female taste preferences. Over a period of time, a notion that certain foods were more preferred among women started to emerge. Man is the hunter, the breadwinner, the meat – and - misal – eater. A woman is the gatherer of vegetables, the cupcake–maker, and salad-eater. This classification is based on how society constructs its understanding of gender. The separation in cooking familiarity and skill is more to do with society’s control over gender than the genetic makeup or sex of people - partly to do with the gendered division of labour, partly to do with the construction of the gendered body. The food choices and acquired tastes are part of the learning which is gendered. Gender is not “natural”. And Pune definitely was not a place for fluid gender roles and feminised masculinities in the 19th and 20th centuries. Misal, tea, kanda-bhaji (onion fritters) were masculine; sabudana khichadi, ghavane (thin pancakes made of rice flour) were feminine. Meat has closely been associated with masculinity, virility, power, and privilege. Energy-dense, spicy, oily, and strongly flavoured foods were perceived as masculine foods, while soft and sweet foods were perceived as feminine.Several columns in “Bombay Chronicle” and “Bombay Gazette” between 1910 and 1940 labelled fish, pasta, salads, cakes, and ice-cream as “female foods”. These foods were sweet or bland. A lady was not supposed to devour a steak. Various restaurants serving Europeans in India designed menus keeping this in mind. The dishes meant for women were described as “decorated”, “colourful” and “joyful”.Those who ate “masculine foods” were perceived as more masculine than those who ate “feminine foods”.The portions mattered too. Eating like a bird was feminine. Eating large portions was manly. Larger portions and spicy/oily food were perceived as more masculine, while smaller portions were considered more feminine. Boys were, and are, encouraged to eat big portions from a very young age. Men eat more in the presence of other men. This was based on the motivation for competition. Pune was known for its feasts where men competed to eat jalebis and laddoos. The newspaper “Jnanaprakash”, between 1850 and 1880, reported several stories where men ate hundreds of jalebis or passed out due to the exhaustion caused by over-eating. These men were treated with respect. Another means of reinforcing masculinity was by restricting women’s dining in public to certain occasions and to the company of men of their families. A restaurant was a public space where only a man ate and hence, this act of consumption was “masculine”. Because misal or meat could only be eaten in restaurants, their status as a forbidden pleasure appealed to men.Culture affects gender roles and hence, food choices. Caste matters too. When fractures in the social fabric became too apparent in 20th century Pune, men belonging to castes which traditionally avoided meat or did not eat out due to reasons related to caste and religion were mocked in public. They were perceived as “weak”, “traitors” and songs were composed to ridicule their dietary choices. Men who gave up tea and meat (mostly followers of Gandhi) were described as “less masculine”, “physically weaker”.Natu and his uncle ate misal several times after their first visit that day. Their families never knew. Both of them participated in the Quit India Movement. Natu threw stones at the police near SP College on August 10, 1942. His uncle participated in a few demonstrations against the British and went underground to avoid arrest. He helped a few freedom fighters in acquiring equipment to run a radio station. Did you eat meat, I had asked Natu seven years ago when I met him for the first time. He smiled and started talking about the various misals he enjoyed over the years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/taste-of-life-when-and-why-the-misal-was-pune-s-steak-served-very-rare-101629370245695.html

19-08-2021||Mumbai||Marathi manoos tired of MVA, will wrest civic body from it: Narayan Rane||Union minister for micro, small and medium enterprises Narayan Rane, who started his week-long Jan Ashirwad Yatra from Mumbai, targeted chief minister and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray saying he has devoided Maharashtra of growth since the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government came to power. Rane paid respects to Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray at Smruti Sthal — a makeshift memorial where the Sena supremo was cremated, in Shivaji Park, Dadar. Later, the Sena workers “purified” the memorial with gaumutra and milk.The Sena is observing Rane’s tour of Mumbai, Palghar and Konkan region closely since he is the party’s bête noire after being removed from the party for questioning Uddhav Thackeray’s leadership in 2005. Rane started his tour from Mumbai and is going through some of the strongholds and bastions of Shiv Sena, including the Mahim-Dadar area.Ahead of next year’s Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls, Rane also invoked “Marathi manoos” and said that they are tired of the Sena’s functioning in the civic body and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will snatch the reins of BMC from the Sena. Without naming Uddhav Thackeray, Rane said that his party will “save” the state from “the ones who are out to destroy Maharashtra.”Speaking at Teacher’s Colony in Kherwadi, which is very close to Kala Nagar in Bandra (East), where Thackeray’s residence Matoshree is situated, Rane said, “I am in Kherwadi, which is next to Kala Nagar, so some of the words I say here must fall on their ears. In the last two years, you have devoided Maharashtra of growth and led it towards destruction. The people of Mumbai are tired of your work and way of functioning, and therefore, they will take away the reins of the corporation.”Also Read | Covid-19: Fewer than 10 active cases in 6 districts of MaharashtraRane later visited Shivaji Park in Dadar and paid his respects to Sena founder. Speaking to reporters opposite Shivaji Park, Rane invoked the memory of Bal Thackeray and said, “I paid respects to Balasaheb and I wished that he should have been alive today. Saheb has made me into whatever I am today. If he were alive today, he would have blessed me to gain more success. Even though his hand is not over me, his blessing is always there.”The day-long political drama also saw a controversy. Hours after the Union minister and other BJP ministers left, Shiv Sainiks gathered there and “purified” the memorial by sprinkling cow urine (gaumutra) and milk. Sena workers, including Appasaheb Patil, wiped the photo of Sena supremo and carried out the rituals.Sena Member of Parliament Vinayak Raut on Wednesday said that Rane does not have the “moral right” to visit Thackeray’s memorial and Shiv Sainiks (party workers) will not allow it, but the party leadership asked its cadre not to resort to any protest. On Thursday Sena workers did not stop Rane from visiting the memorial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/marathi-manoos-tired-of-mva-will-wrest-civic-body-from-it-narayan-rane-101629367544874.html
19-08-2021||Delhi||CBI to probe Delhi govt’s bus purchase||The Union government has recommended a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the 2020 purchase of 1,000 air-conditioned low-floor buses by the Delhi government, and a maintenance contract for them, both of which have been another issue of contention between the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government and the state unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The ministry of home affairs (MHA) informed Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Kumar Dev about this in a note dated August 16.The note, a copy of which has been seen by HT, said that the ministry of home affairs (MHA), after examining the report submitted by a three-member panel appointed by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal asked CBI to look into the matter.People familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified confirmed this as well.A PE is the precursor to a First Information Report (FIR), during which agency carries out investigations to ascertain whether a cognisable offence is made out.The Delhi government termed the move “harassment” by the Centre.“There is absolutely no truth to these allegations. A committee was already set up to investigate the matter thoroughly, which gave a clean chit. It is a politically motivated conspiracy against AAP. The BJP wants to prevent the people of Delhi from getting new buses,” the Delhi government said in a statement.“In the past as well, the Centre has tried to harass the Delhi government using CBI, but not even once has their attempt been successful because there has never been any truth to any of their allegations. The Delhi government does not believe in the politics of slander, it only believes in good governance and is committed to delivering upon its promise of good governance,” it added.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the government “scam” will be “exposed” by the inquiry. “It is a matter of satisfaction that the Ministry of Home Affairs has decided to refer the Delhi BJP complaint regarding the scam in purchase of 1,000 buses for a CBI inquiry. Now very soon, the Delhi government scam and those who planned it will get exposed,” he said.HT reported on July 11 that the L-G-appointed panel gave a clean chit to the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) in the tendering and procurement of the buses, although it found some “procedural lapses” arising out of “a bona fide decision making”.“The tendering process of purchase of buses warrants no interference and suffers from no major infirmity... The committee, prima facie, did not come across any material to impute criminal misconduct attributable to any public official,” the report said.“There were only procedural lapses apparently arising out of a bona fide decision-making process. However, a greater effort for understanding the market and a higher degree of due diligence in assessing reasonableness of bids was required compared to what seems to have been demonstrated,” it added.DTC, which comes under the Delhi government, floated last March, a tender for procurement of 1,000 CNG low-floor buses and issued another tender for allotting the annual maintenance contract (AMC) for these buses four months later.It was spending ₹875 crore in the procurement of the 1,000, buses and the AMC, as per the second tender, was costing the DTC ₹3,500 crore. To be sure, the purchase is a one-time expense, and the maintenance contract is valid for 12 years.However, the BJP levelled allegations of corruption in the tender. On the directions of the Delhi L-G, the state vigilance department constituted a three-member committee headed by former bureaucrat OP Aggarwal, and comprising principal secretary (vigilance) KR Meena, and transport commissioner Ashish Kundra to look into the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/centre-asks-cbi-to-probe-delhi-govt-s-purchase-of-1-000-low-floor-buses-101629367065025.html

19-08-2021||Patna||Bihar CM-led delegation to meet PM on Aug 23 to discuss caste-based census||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar will head an all-party delegation from the state to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 23 to discuss the demand for a caste-based census.“I had sought time from the PM to meet him with a delegation. The PM has given time of August 23. Many thanks to him “ Kumar tweeted on Thursday.The CM, who called on governor Phagu Chauhan in the afternoon, said the names of delegation members would soon be finalised and sent to the PM. “Tejashwi Prasad Yadav (of the opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal) will also go. He along with other members of the Opposition met me on this issue during the monsoon session. It is an issue on which all the parties are one. The BJP is also finalising the name (of its representative in the delegation),” he added.Yadav, leader of Oposition in the state, confirmed his presence at the meeting. The Bihar assembly has passed two resolutions seeking a caste-based census, something the Union government has sought to avoid, given the sensitivity of the matter. The demand for a caste-based census comes from a belief that the current reservation (or quota) regime is skewed and not representative of the current composition of the population. Earlier this week, Kumar praised the PM for removing the confusion on a state’s right to decide on other backward classes (OBCs) and said he was hopeful of getting him to discuss the matter related to caste-based census as well. His reference is to the 127th Constitution Amendment passed by Parliament in the monsoon session that concluded last week, and which restores the rights of states to identify and maintain a list of backward classes. “In Bihar, then chief minister Karpoori Thakur created a separate category for extremely backward classes (EBCs). Different states have done it differently, as they were empowered to do so. There was, however, some confusion for the last few years. After the court order, the Centre decide to clear it that states continue to have the right,” he said.He said that any decision on a caste-based census would be taken only after discussing the matter with PM. “Doing it at the state level will not be census. It will be counting only, as some states did in the past,” he said.The Union government did conduct a socio-economic and caste census in 2011, but caste data was not made public. India’s last full caste census was done in 1931.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-cm-led-delegation-to-meet-pm-on-aug-23-to-discuss-caste-based-census-101629358124285.html

19-08-2021||Bangalore||Man returns to India after 600 days in Saudi jail for FB post he didn’t make||An investigation by the Karnataka Police helped a man lodged in Saudi Arabia prison for over 600 days return home. Thirty-four-year-old Harish Bangera, an air-conditioning technician, was arrested on charges of blasphemy, on December 22, 2019, for making contemptuous remarks about Mecca and the king of Saudi Arabia on Facebook. A subsequent investigation by Karnataka Police revealed that the derogatory messages were posted by a fake account created by two men - Abdul Huyez and Abdul Thuyez - in Udupi district. Police arrested the two men in October 2020, who revealed that they impersonated Bangera on Facebook. Using the details of the investigation, Bangera’s family managed to get him released. Also Read | Fearing complications, Covid infected couple dies by suicide in KarnatakaBangera arrived at Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru on Wednesday. Talking to HT, he said that he was lodged in an “inquiry jail” and the efforts of people back home ensured that he was not sentenced. “I can’t thank enough those who helped secure my release. The Udupi Police’s report proved my innocence. They worked hard after releasing that I had been framed. If it wasn’t for Covid-19, I would have been released much earlier. All the documents were submitted, but the courts were closed due to Covid-19,” said Bangera. He added that even though he was offered to continue working in Saudi Arabia, he wanted to return to his hometown. “The company was following the law. So, they asked me to surrender before the court. Once I was released, they said I could continue working since I was proven innocent, but I wanted to be with my family,” he added. An investigation into the case began soon after Bangera was arrested in Saudi Arabia and his wife filed a police complaint claiming the Facebook account was fake, said Udupi Police. “Bangera wrote some posts on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which led to some issues. He later deleted the post and apologised. This fake post was retaliation for that incident. Once Facebook confirmed we were on the right track, we found the actual perpetrators. The case is under trial now,” said a senior official of the Dakshina Kannada Police. The Udupi Police, through Director General and Inspector General of Police Praveen Sood and the Indian embassy in Saudi Arabia, informed the Saudi Arabian government about the arrest and this resulted in his release, the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/man-released-after-600-days-in-saudi-jail-returns-to-india-101629355424055.html

A seven-member committee set up by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) had earlier looked into the incidents of violence following the West Bengal assembly elections and recommended a court-monitored CBI probe.Also Read | Govt failed to properly probe post-poll violence complaints: Calcutta HCCBI will probe the allegations of murder and rape, raised shortly after the overwhelming victory of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) against rival Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in these elections. According to people familiar with the development, the Calcutta high court also directed that a separate Special Investigation Team (SIT), with senior officers from the West Bengal cadre, be set up to probe the other allegations cited by the NHRC committee.This SIT will comprise three IPS officers -- Soumet Mitra, Suman Bala Sahoo, and Ranbir Kumar. The proceedings shall be monitored by a retired judge of the Supreme Court; a detailed order regarding this will be issued later, the Calcutta high court said.Also Read | Central agency ready to probe Bengal post-poll violence: Govt to HCThe West Bengal government should hand over all records of cases to the CBI for the investigation, the Calcutta high court said, adding that it will be a "court-monitored investigation" and that any obstruction during the course of the probe by anyone shall be "viewed seriously".Post-poll violence reportedly broke out in West Bengal following the announcement of the assembly election results on May 2. It was alleged that the Trinamool Congress (TMC), which won with an overwhelming majority in the poll results, turned a blind eye when its supporters clashed with the opposing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers at various places in the state.After several BJP leaders raised alarm over a "complete breakdown" of law and order, the Union ministry of home affairs deputed a four-member team to visit the areas reported to have witnessed post-poll violence. The Calcutta high court eventually took cognizance of the matter and asked the NHRC to examine all the cases of alleged violence.The seven-member committee submitted its final report on July 13, slamming the Trinamool Congress-led state government, while recommending a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe. The state government later filed an affidavit, refuting the charges while alleging that the report was politically motivated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/calcutta-high-court-orders-cbi-probe-into-west-bengal-post-poll-violence-101629352612684.html

We have kept their names secret.” He said, “The majority of artistes have lost all of their income. And there is no clear path back to pre-pandemic levels of employment.” Shatrughan Sharma, a theatre artiste said, “Earlier, a lot of film shoots used to take place in the city and theatre artistes used to get work.

19-08-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Man without a mobile number||Mobile phone has become as necessary as oxygen. Everybody seems to need it. Not Ramesh Kumar. Even though, he says, he earns enough money as a rickshaw puller to afford one.“I spend my nights on the patri,” he explains, referring to the footpath. And if you sleep on the patri, he says, you get to know all the bad things that happen at night in this city. For instance, “there’s no guarantee you will wake up in the morning with your samaan (things) still by your side.” Indeed, Mr Kumar had “3-4” mobiles stolen in the past while asleep. “And now I don’t keep it at all.”This morning, the rickshaw puller has parked his rickshaw on a street-side in central Delhi, close to where he sleeps. Wearing pants and a baniyan, he is leisurely perched on the passenger’s seat, smoking a beedi. In his mid-20s, Mr Kumar declares his indifference to the city. “I’m from Ayodhya, the land of Bhagwan Ram. I don’t belong to Dilli.” He doesn’t really need a phone “because a mobile helps you stay connected to your family and I’m anyway mostly with my family.” He tends to be more often in Ayodhya than Delhi. “I spend a few weeks in Delhi, and then a few months in my village.” There Mr Kumar helps his father cultivate the small agricultural land the family owns “which doesn’t yield enough, and that’s why I have to be (regularly) in Dilli to earn.” The arrangement has been in place for 11 years.Very many folks in the city pass their spare time, and even survive the loneliness, by watching videos on mobile. Mr Kumar doesn’t get any spare time, he says, shaking his head. “Riding a rickshaw is painful. Your arms and legs hurt by the day’s end.” At night, after dinner, he parks the rickshaw beside a paan shop and lies down on the pavement. “I’m so exhausted by then that I have no taakat (energy) for anything.” He pauses, and adds: “Sometimes a begana kutta (stray dog) sleeps by my side, sometimes a charsi (addict) opens the bag I use as a pillow… but I sleep deep, and I have nothing precious worth stealing—except my life.” Here he smiles, “And my life is precious only to my family.”Turning to look at his smouldering beedi, he says—“my mobile is my beedi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-man-without-a-mobile-number-101629329289733.html

19-08-2021||Delhi||Elevated ramps, flyovers to clear traffic chaos around station||The Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) has prepared a comprehensive traffic circulation and road improvement plan to cater to the footfall and vehicular traffic that is likely to increase once the redevelopment work on the New Delhi Railway Station kicks in next year.The plan was submitted to the Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning and Engineering) Centre (UTTIPEC) in July.Vice-chairman of RLDA, Ved Parkash Dudeja said, “We have prepared a detailed plan to cater to the increase in traffic and footfall and ensure smooth traffic movement in and around the station complex. This will also help in reducing congestion in Connaught Place.”In the ₹1000-crore traffic plan that is included in the first phase of the project, RLDA has proposed constructing 23 lane kilometres of elevated corridors (approx 11km) and widening arterial roads around the station complex.Lane kilometre is a method employed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) that involves measuring the length of each new lane that is built instead of counting the overall length of the highway. For instance, one km of a four lane highway is counted as four kilometres under the method.Currently, 450,000 passengers visit the station daily (160-170 million annually). RLDA officials said the projected increase in peak hour passenger volume (number of passengers at the station per hour) is likely to range from 45,000 to 55,000 in the next two decades.The built-up area is going to increase from approximately 1.1million sq.ft to over 5.5 million sq ft during the first phase of the development. Currently, the entry points at both Ajmeri Gate and Paharganj are congested and the redevelopment work is going to further increase vehicular traffic and footfall in the area.As per the plan, widening of Panchkuian road, Basant Road, Chelmsford Road, Bhavbhuti Road and Minto Road have been proposed. There will be separate entry and exit routes to the station.To provide connectivity to the station’s entry, flyovers have been proposed on Basant Road (which can be accessed from Panchkuian road) and Chelmsford Road.“We plan to construct elevated sections on Basant Road and Chelmsford Road up till the concourse of the station. These roads are underutilised right now. Basant Road is very narrow. An elevated corridor will increase the capacity of the road,” said Dudeja. There is also a flyover proposed at DDU marg for entry to the station.For vehicles leaving the station, ramps will be provided on Asaf Ali Road, Bhavbhuti Road and Chelmsford Road (a little ahead of the entry point).The State Entry Road is proposed to be developed as a pedestrian street connecting the station complex to Connaught Place. “It is proposed to be developed as a high street and will be completely pedestrian-friendly,” said an RLDA official.Dudeja said the traffic plan incorporates measures to facilitate pedestrian movement and non-motorised transport.A senior UTTIPEC official said, “RLDA has submitted the plan. We have asked them to provide some more information.”Sabyasachi Das, former in-charge of UTTIPEC, said, “There is a need for a comprehensive plan to decongest the area around the station. Earlier, when RLDA planned the redevelopment, it was focused on just development of their land. It is good that they have planned improvement of roads around the station. But construction of 40-storey towers and other developments will increase traffic, even if it is a transit-oriented development. There is a need to have a comprehensive plan for an influence area of 5-6 kms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/elevated-ramps-flyovers-to-clear-traffic-chaos-around-station-101629325921512.html
19-08-2021||Delhi||New Delhi station facelift likely in 2022||The Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) plans to invite request for proposal (RFP) from nine firms for the redevelopment of New Delhi Railway Station (NDRS), India’s largest and second busiest railway facility, officials privy to the development said.They said work on the first phase of the project is expected to start next year.RLDA has also prepared a traffic circulation and improvement plan for the station and its surrounding areas. The plan was submitted to the Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning and Engineering) Centre (UTTIPEC), the apex body for approval of traffic plans in Delhi, in July.A senior UTTIPEC official said, “RLDA has submitted the plan. We have asked them to provide some more information.”RLDA vice-chairman Ved Parkash Dudeja said they aim to make New Delhi station an iconic structure with large-scale infrastructure development in and around it. “While the development at the station will provide state-of-the-art facilities to passengers, we have also made a detailed plan to decongest the area. We will invite the RFP for the first phase of works, which involves station development, commercial centres, that will begin by September-end or early October, and we plan to start the construction work by next year.”The redevelopment plan, estimated to cost around ₹14,000 crore, will be implemented in two phases and will be based on the Centre’s Transit Oriented Development (TOD) policy. Of the 160 acres of land where new developments have been proposed, work on around 85 acres will be taken up in the first phase at a cost of ₹6,500.In the first phase, the railway development body plans to construct a 70 metres high dome-shaped building (infinity tower), 40-storey twin towers and business district, providing office and commercial space, multilevel car-parking on either side of the station (Paharganj and Ajmeri Gate) for 5,000 vehicles, retail hub, pedestrian boulevard, etc. It will also upgrade the road network around the station.The revamp of the New Delhi station, which handles approximately 450,000 passengers daily (160-170 million passengers annually), has been going on since 2007. Dudeja said the initial plan was not implemented as it required shutting down half of the station for three years and the other half for another three years.“The initial plan was a bit complicated as it involved aligning all the railway tracks, for which it was mandatory to close half of the station in a phased manner over a period of six years. It is not possible to suspend train operations at the station, which is the second busiest in India. In the new plan, we will not have to close the tracks for such a long duration,” said Dudeja.In the new plan, RLDA has proposed a 70m-high dome-shaped building above the tracks. A large concourse of the building will be connected to all the 16 platforms, and facilities such as retail, lounge, restrooms will be there above the tracks; multilevel parking lots, office complexes will be part of the larger station complex.At the concourse, there will be two arrival and departure points each. The concourse will be connected to multilevel car parking-cum-office spaces on either side of the station through skywalks. “Currently, all the buses are parked on the main road. The new facility will have a bus bay on the ground floor with a capacity of up to 100 buses. The parking lots will be connected to the station building at the concourse level. The entire area will be accessible to all,” said an RLDA official.Earlier this year, RLDA finalised nine national and international firms based on the request for quotation it received for the project.As the project requires coordination with multiple agencies, RLDA officials said they have been holding regular meetings with various departments.RLDA officials said they also plan to run battery operated cars or carts to connect all the buildings.In the second phase, RLDA plans to develop the remaining 75 acres with focus on developing green spaces as ground coverage will be less than 25%.Redevelopment of railway residential colonies, and other residential units will also be taken up in the second phase.The commercial district, which includes 40-storey twin towers for commercial purposes, retail facilities, etc, are proposed to be located near Bhavabhuti Marg, near the Civic Centre (municipal headquarters).RLDA officials said the works planned in the first phase will be completed within four years.A K Jain, former planning commissioner at DDA, said, “While redevelopment of the area is the need of the hour, concentrating commercial developments in a few pockets is not a good idea. It will only result in more congestion, especially in the heart of the city. Commercial development should be planned along the railway track from Old Delhi station to Nizammudin railway station. This will help in distributing traffic. The railways have a lot of property in Delhi. Instead of constructing large commercial spaces around New Delhi station, it should develop spaces around Dwarka, Anand Vihar, etc.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-delhi-station-facelift-likely-in-2022-101629325164343.html
19-08-2021||Delhi||Centre defends top cop’s appointment||he Centre on Wednesday opposed a plea challenging the appointment of Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police commissioner even as the Delhi high court refused to issue notice and asked if similar pleas are pending before any other court.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh posted the plea by one Sadre Alam, challenging Asthana’s appointment and subsequent extension of term by one year, for further hearing on August 24. “Is any such matter pending before any other court? Just take instructions,” the bench said.When the counsel for the petitioner, advocate BS Bagga, urged the court to issue notice, it responded, “No, no. We are still going to read everything. We will see.”Additional solicitor general (ASG) Chetan Sharma, appearing for the Centre, told the court that no such challenge was pending in any court according to his knowledge. He said the government would seek instructions, following which the court adjourned the matter.Sharma also questioned the locus standi of the petitioner and the maintainability of the petition, claiming that service matters cannot be challenged in a public interest litigation.“It has become a business for so-called integrity-keepers to challenge any appointment made by the authorities,” Sharma argued.Advocate Bagga contended that the July 27 order appointing Asthana was in violation of the existing service law. He said Asthana was appointed to the post just four days before retirement when the service conditions mandate a minimum residual tenure of six months.The plea seeks initiation of steps for appointing a Delhi Police commissioner strictly in accordance with the directions issued by the Supreme Court earlier.Similar petitions have also been filed before the Supreme Court, including one by an NGO, Centre for Public Interest Litigation, urging directions to the central government to produce its July 27 order that approved the inter-cadre deputation of Asthana from Gujarat cadre to AGMUT (Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram and Union Territory) cadre.A contempt plea has also been filed in the apex court by advocate M L Sharma against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah for appointing Asthana as Delhi Police commissioner in an alleged violation of the judgment in the Prakash Singh case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/centre-defends-top-cop-s-appointment-101629324645420.html
19-08-2021||Chandigarh||Safina Baig says Anand Sharma was rude to her; MP denies charge||Baramulla District Development Council chairperson Safina Baig on Wednesday accused Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Anand Sharma of threatening her and passing derogatory remarks during a review meeting in Srinagar. The Congress leader was part of a parliamentary standing committee, which is currently in Kashmir. Baig, who is the wife of former MP and former J&K deputy chief minister Muzaffar Baig, said Sharma threatened her and passed the derogatory remarks because she had unintentionally misnamed Sharma, for which she apologised. “I apologised, but Sharma behaved very rudely and had a threatening tone. He did not treat me as if I was a democratically elected representative of Kashmir,” she said, adding that she highlighted several issues pertaining to Kashmir, especially Baramulla district. However, she left the meeting after the incident. “I felt threatened and sad because of the way the Congress leader treated me,’ she said. People’s Conference also took strong exception to Sharma’s alleged behaviour and called it rude and misogynistic. “An innocuous mistake of getting his royal highness Anand Sharma’s name wrong invited wrath of the delusional prince who broke all parliamentary etiquette and protocol by making misogynistic and derogatory remarks against Baig,” PC spokesman Adnan Ashraf said in a statement. “The behaviour of the honourable parliamentarian reeks of a colonial mindset. The leaders of same party, which is trying to advocate and articulate the suffering of the people, are lording over elected representatives of Jammu and Kashmir due to the new found powers of “parliamentary delegations” in the Union Territory status of J&K. Lording over elected representatives of J&K is an age old aberration of INC leaders” Ashraf said, while urging the Rajya Sabha chairperson to take notice of this highly condemnable incident. Congress leader Anand Sharma termed the allegations baseless and false. “This is untrue. There were other members, officials of the administration and around 150 people in the meeting. Anybody will tell you that the allegations are baseless. I was not rude to her. In fact, other members of our parliamentary standing committee, including women, had been upset by her attitude and I had to pacify other members of the committee. Being the chairperson of the committee, I do not want to react to this issue and give credence to her.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/safina-baig-says-anand-sharma-was-rude-to-her-mp-denies-charge-101629322361024.html
19-08-2021||Chandigarh||Mehbooba’s mother appears before ED in money laundering case||Gulshan Nazir, the mother of People’s Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti, mother of former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, on Wednesday appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) here and answered questions in a case related to money laundering even as the PDP alleged that the Centre had “talibanised” and “subverted” all institutions.Mufti accompanied her mother Nazir, who is in her 70s, to the ED’s zonal office in Srinagar. After the questioning, she tweeted, “In New India, being summoned by agencies like NIA and ED has become a ritual for whoever disagrees with GOI’s divisive agenda and policies. In my mother’s case, the chronology is quite clear.” “The last time she received a summon was when the PDP boycotted the Delimitation Commission followed by another summon when I staged a peaceful protest on 5th August criticising the illegal abrogation of Article 370,” Mehbooba said.She took a dig at a certain section of the media and said “Unfortunately agencies like NIA and ED that should be working on serious cases are weaponised to harass and punish political opponents. GOI has Talibanised and subverted all institutions inc Godi media (sic) to the extent where instead of upholding the truth they peddle their lies”.The ED had been issuing summons to Nazir, wife of the former J&K chief minister late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, since April but she had so far avoided visiting the ED. The summons had come after the ED questioned Mufti in March under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.The criminal case filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) is linked to the recovery of at least two diaries by the ED after raids on an alleged associate of Mehbooba.The diaries contain the details of some purported payments made from the chief minister’s discretionary fund in alleged contravention of rules, the officials said.These funds are alleged to have been diverted during the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) rule in the erstwhile state.A few lakh rupees from these funds are alleged to have been transferred into the accounts of Nazir and some others, and the ED wants to question her about it, the officials said.Veteran politican and CPM leader M Y Tarigami also tweeted saying “Summoning aged wife of former union home minister by ED is glimpse of coercive tactics employed by central government to kill dissent”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mehboobas-mother-appears-before-ed-in-money-laundering-case-101629321641795.html

The two-day annual conference is being held online due to Covid-19 pandemic and 33 scholars including Tibetan PhD scholars and PhD candidates from across the world are participating in it.“The number of Tibetans escaping to exile has also decreased due to increased surveillance at the borders,” said Tsering, adding that only five Tibetans had escaped in 2020 and seven had left in 2021. “This means that people who can testify about the situation within Tibet through lived experience is also decreasing,” Sikyong said.The 54-year-old exile leader said, due to geopolitical reasons, the few lines of communication between the people inside and outside Tibet had been banned by India and other countries for security reasons.Sikyong also urged Tibetans to be cautious of Chinese manipulation to foment conflicts within the Tibetan community-in-exile.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fewer-tibetans-escaping-due-to-surveillance-penpa-tsering-101629318940776.html
19-08-2021||Chandigarh||Tourist entry restricted in HP but political rallies go on unabated||With the spectre of the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic looming large on Himachal Pardesh, the state has imposed restrictions on tourist entry in the state. However, it is yet to put a lid on political gatherings despite the continuous upsurge in Covid infections over the last three weeks. The hill-state has added 5,600 fresh Covid infections to its tally since the last week of July, while 43 people have lost their lives. Significantly, the positivity rate has jumped from 0.9% to 2.3%.Large crowds are turning up at public meets called by chief minister Jai Ram Thakur and his cabinet colleagues in the run up to bypolls in the state. Little attention is paid to social distancing and just a few people mask-up. Often political leaders themselves flout Covid protocols with abandon. For instance, the CM and BJP state chief Suresh Kashyap removed their masks while complying to selfie requests on the sidelines of a public meeting and two former MPs Rajan Sushant and Kripal Parmar sparred at a public event at Fatehpur assembly segment.Not to be left behind, the Congress has also been holding large political events at poll-bound constituencies as well. History repeating itselfA similar trend was seen during the second wave of the pandemic. Himachal’s daily case numbers, which had been steadily declining since November 2020 began rising in February-end. Virus transmission picked pace in March and peaked in April, outpacing the positivity rate during the first wave.It is no coincidence that at that time too political parties had been campaigning for local council elections. However, the state government had attributed the spike in cases to people’s negligence during social events. Notwithstanding that Covid norms had been brazenly flouted during election rallies. On August 13, restrictions were placed on the entry of tourists to Himachal Pradesh. Now, people going to Himachal will have to either show a RT-PCR negative report (not older than 72 hours) or a RAT negative report (not older than 24 hours). Those who are fully vaccinated do not need to furnish a Covid negative report.The state government also closed down schools and public transport is running with 50% occupancy. However, the government did not ban political or social events.Onus on the public BJP’s chief spokesperson Randhir Sharma said, “The first and second waves were caused due to an influx of visitors from outside the state. We always appeal to people to follow Covid protocols at rallies. Even Union minister for information and broadcasting Anurag Thakur, who is visiting the state on a week-long tour, has appealed everybody to follow Covid norms.” Echoing his BJP counterpart, Congress spokesperson Naresh Chauhan said, “The Congress is strictly following Covid norms and our party is not holding big events,” adding, “However, the same cannot be said for the ruling dispensation.” Bypolls for the Mandi parliamentary constituency and three assembly segments — Fatehpur, Arki, and Jubbal-Kotkhai — are likely to be held in September. Both, the BJP and Congress, are holding a series of political events in these constituencies. Once the elections are announced, there will be poll campaigns by the parties and the candidates, which usually draw large crowds and may trigger a third wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tourist-entry-restricted-in-hp-but-political-rallies-go-on-unabated-101629318462409.html

Party’s state affairs in-charge Dushyant Gautam said, “I personally spoke to some leaders who had certain issues at the local level. We have assured them that the senior leadership will listen to their grievances and they should not think of leaving the organisation. Some of them seem to be satisfied.” The Joshi group claimed that those expected to join the SAD have categorically asked the party leadership to make efforts to establish contact with the ex-minister first. “We are joining the SAD unconditionally. We all are with Joshi. Many of us received calls about not taking the step of leaving the party but we told our senior leaders that the party is not taking Punjab seriously. If we have to live in Punjab we have to speak for its people,” said a member of Joshi group. Joshi is likely to join the Akali Dal along with senior party leaders such as former Dasuya MLA Sukhjeet Kaur Sahi, former state Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) chief Mohit Gupta, Kamal Chetli, the party’s Ludhiana West candidate in the 2017 assembly polls and former Ludhiana deputy mayor RD Sharma. While Joshi was expelled from the party for six years after his outbursts against the state and the central leadership last month, other leaders are still members of the saffron party. Also, the party on Tuesday went into a huddle in Delhi with its national affairs incharge calling a meeting with Punjab president Ashwani Sharma along with general secretaries. These leaders are expected to meet party national president JP Nadda on Thursday on the issue. A senior party leader termed the likelihood of some leaders joining the SAD as unfortunate. “The party should not have allowed it to happen. All these leaders expected to join the SAD have raised the party flag for years despite all odds,” said a former minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-reaches-out-to-disgruntled-punjab-leaders-amid-talk-of-joshi-others-joining-sad-101629318406116.html

Sidhu, who was inducted into the AAP fold in the presence of party’s Punjab affairs co-incharge Jarnail Singh, said he took the decision to leave the Congress due to anti-people policies of the Capt Amarinder Singh-led government and its failure to fulfil the pre-poll promises. Jarnail Singh and deputy leader of opposition in Vidhan Sabha and MLA Sarabjit Kaur Manuke also slammed the state government for not fulfilling the poll promises. They said even the newly appointed PPCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu has been pointing out the failure of the government. It is learnt that Sidhu was eyeing Congress ticket from the Atam Nagar assembly constituency but quit the party anticipating that he won’t get one. He unsuccessfully sought the party ticket from the segment in 2017 also. Sidhu said, “I did not leave the party due to ticket. The party failed to fulfil the promises such as putting an end to the drug menace and punishing those involved in the sacrilege incidents. Even I am not able to face the public. People are not getting proper drinking water supply. On the other hand, the AAP government in Delhi has been working for the betterment of the public.”In July, former PPCC general secretary Daljit Singh Grewal had also joined the AAP, accusing the Congress of not delivering on the poll promises.

19-08-2021||Chandigarh||HC refuses to accept compromise between accused and rape victim||The Punjab and Haryana high court has refused to accept a compromise between a married woman and a person whom she had accused of raping her. The bench of Justice Rajesh Bhardwaj observed that the petitioner is alleged to have committed a heinous offence and he established physical relations with the woman forcefully by blackmailing her. “The allegations levelled in the FIR amount to cognisable offence and truth can be unravelled only after leading the evidence in a trial court. Interference by the high court on the basis of alleged compromise is not called for,” the bench said. The FIR in the case was registered in July 2019 in Faridabad. The petitioner had approached the high court in July with a compromise deed between him and the woman that was effected the same month. It was alleged that the woman (28) became familiar with the accused and thereafter in due course of time taking benefit of the relations, he developed physical relations with her forcefully. He started forcing the woman and established physical relations repeatedly. On resistance she was threatened that he would upload her photos on Facebook and kill her husband, she had alleged adding that having no other alternative, at one point of time, she disclosed the same to her husband, who got the FIR registered. The accused had claimed that both the parties have amicably settled the dispute and they have arrived at a compromise and in view of this, carrying on with his prosecution would be an abuse of the process of the court and thus, the same deserves to be quashed. The police had opposed the plea stating that the offence involved is heinous and on completion of investigation the challan already stands submitted before the trial court and further the compromise alleged has no legal sanctity. The court took note of SC observations that in case of heinous offences, the compromise arrived would be meaningless. It also took note of the fact that allegations against him were of forcefully establishing physical relations repeatedly by blackmailing her of posting her photos on Facebook and killing her husband.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-refuses-to-accept-compromise-between-accused-and-rape-victim-101629318401669.html

According to a top vigilance official, Saini reached the bureau office at 8.10 pm, on his own, saying he wanted to join investigation in the corruption case against him. The official said the former DGP parked his car outside the compound gate in order to project that he had come to join investigation in a case in which he had got interim anticipatory bail and was to join investigation under orders of the Punjab and Haryana high court by August 18, 2021.On getting this information, the investigating officer apprehended Saini while he continued sitting in his car and refused to get out.

Saini has been claiming to be a tenant in the house after his retirement.On Tuesday, Saini had moved the HC pleading that the VB was likely to arrest him in another case. However, the petition was withdrawn by the ex-DGP. On August 3, high drama prevailed outside Saini’s Sector-20 house when a VB team came to arrest him following a registration of the FIR in an assets case. However, the bureau could not find Saini at his house despite having credible information about his presence The case files According to information, Saini has been arrested in connection with an FIR registered on September 17, 2020, under sections 420 (cheating), 467, 468 (forgery), 408 (breach of trust) and 120 (B) ( criminal conspiracy) at vigilance bureau police station in Phase -1, Mohali.The case, pertaining to the sale of land in Kurali, was registered against Devinder Singh Sandhu, director, WWICS Estate Private Ltd , Naginder Rao, general manager of WWICS, Ashok Kumar Sikka (PCS Officer), for forgery of documents with regard to change of land use by WWICS in connivance with employees of the local bodies department. The VB further nominated PWD XEN Nimratdeep Singh and his father Jaspal Singh in the case. The VB claimed that the amount at which Jaspal had sold the land was utilised to buy the Sector- 20 house where Saini was staying. “Saini and Jaspal showed a forged rent agreement between them. Later, Saini bought the house and paid some amount to Jaspal also,” the VB probe had claimed. Though VB had attached Saini’s house, he was not nominated in the case till now even as Jaspal and his son had got bail from the high court. This is the fourth case registered against Saini during the current Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress government in the state. In all other cases, Saini has managed to secure blanket bails. Saini had repeatedly claimed that the Congress government has been vindictive against him because as vigilance chief during the previous SAD-BJP regime, he had registered cases against Amarinder Singh and his aide BS Chahal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vigilance-bureau-arrests-ex-punjab-dgp-sumedh-saini-in-land-fraud-case-101629318340746.html

19-08-2021||Chandigarh||Ranit Singh murder case: Court to pronounce verdict on August 26||A special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court will pronounce the judgment in Ranjit Singh murder case, in which Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh is one of the accused, on August 26. The court has issued notice to the respective jail superintendents to present the accused — Ram Rahim who is behind bars at Rohtak’s Sunaria Jail and Krishan Lal who is lodged in Ambala central jail — via video-conferencing on the above-mentioned date. Ranjit Singh, a former follower of Gurmeet Ram Rahim, was shot dead by four assailants on July 10, 2002, at his native Khanpur Kolian village in Kurukshetra after he ‘raised his voice’ against the dera head. Earlier, special CBI judge Dr Sushil Kumar Garg had fixed August 23 as the date for the final order and also sought the physical presence of the accused. However, the district attorney cited the January 11, 2019 verdict against the dera chief when the accused was produced through video-conferencing (VC). “In the present case, too, it is requested that the presence of the accused be allowed through VC in view of the possible threat to law and order situation,” he said. The district attorney also said since the Haryana Vidhan Sabha session was also scheduled from August 20-25, the police would remain occupied, while requesting the court to fix any other date after August 25 for pronouncing the order. The court then fixed August 26 for the final order and directed the superintendents of Sunaria and Ambala jails to ensure the presence of accused Ram Rahim and Krishan Lal through video-conferencing. Public prosecutors can address their arguments in rebuttal on August 23. The dera head has already been convicted twice in separate cases. Ram Rahim was convicted of rape by a CBI court on August 25, 2017, and was sentenced to a 20-year jail term two days later. His conviction led to widespread violence in Panchkula in which alteast 36 lives were lost and hundreds were injured. In January 2019, Ram Rahim and three others were sentenced to life imprisonment in the journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati murder case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ranit-singh-murder-case-court-to-pronounce-verdict-on-august-26-101629316303116.html

A nine-foot-tall cold bronze statue of Maharaja Ranjit Singh was on Tuesday vandalised by an activist of the banned Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP). In a viral video, the accused, who has been arrested, could be seen chanting slogans, breaking the arm of the statue and dismantling Singh’s bust from the horse and throwing it on the ground before being pulled by another man. Gorpal Singh, the leader of the Sikh community in Peshawar, on Tuesday said they would bring the statue to the city if the Punjab government cannot protect it from miscreants. Singh said that a delegation of Sikhs would go to Lahore, which is the capital of Punjab, to bring the statue to Peshawar. The Punjab government should avoid displaying the statue of Ranjit Singh time and again if it could not protect it, he said. He said that a picture of Ranjit Singh was put on display at Historic Balahisar Fort in Peshawar around six years back and till date no damage had been done to it, while the Punjab government could not protect a single statue. Singh said that the frequent attacks on the statue hurt the community’s feelings and sentiments. This is not the first time that the statue has been targeted. The arm of the statue was broken in Lahore last year. It was also damaged in August 2019 by two young men. Maharaja Ranjit Singh was the founder of the Sikh Empire, which ruled the northwest Indian subcontinent in the early half of the 19th century. The statue shows the regal Sikh emperor sitting on a horse, sword in hand, complete in Sikh attire. Sculpted by local artists, under the aegis of the Fakir Khana Museum, the statue is meant to invoke the feeling of the emperor being present, with its real-life proportions, and was unveiled on his 180th death anniversary. Ranjit Singh passed away in 1839.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vandalisation-of-maharaja-ranjit-singh-s-statue-anguish-pak-sikhs-101629316006617.html

Even on a sultry day, impressive gatherings were spotted at the election meetings in the predominantly rural segment. The former deputy chief minister visited about 12 places in Zira, a part of Khadoor Sahib Lok Sabha seat. Badal’s day began at around 9.30am as he left Ferozepur city to meet near Zira a group of motorbike-riding youths, who escorted him to Gurdwara Singh Sabha in Zira. The venue of most of the meetings addressed by Sukhbir was gurdwaras even as no political sloganeering was noticed at the shrines. Covid-19 guidelines of maintaining social distancing and wearing face covers were grossly violated at the events. Sukhdev Singh Sheera, the state secretary of the SAD’s new ally — Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) — was also present at the launch of the Akalis’ electoral activity. On the way to Zira, a group of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) raised slogans against the Akali leadership for the party’s alleged initial support to the contentious central farm laws. The SKM activists had also removed party’s publicity hoardings put on the Amritsar-Bathinda highway. Badal’s speeches focused on promises already announced by the SAD-BSP alliance, underlining thrust to the education and medical care. He was accompanied by veteran Akali leader and the party nominee from Zira segment Janmeja Singh Sekhon. Badal, who represents Ferozepur Lok Sabha segment, also assured development of the area if SAD-BSP is voted to power in the 2022 elections. “Sekhon sa’ab has a deep understanding of the rural issues and for the last 20 years, he had been urging the SAD to field him from Zira. If voted to power, he will be given charge of the irrigation ministry. Sekhon got a ministerial berth in every Akali government in the last over three decades,” said Badal, while trying to strike a chord with the Akali sympathisers. Trying to undermine Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Badal said Punjab has only three main parties: SAD, its new electoral ally the BSP, and the Congress. “Like the Congress, the AAP is driven by its Delhi-based leadership whereas SAD represents the spirit of Panth and Punjab. Punjab does not need a high command in Delhi,” he added. He gave a call to teach a lesson to the Congress’s Zira legislator Kulbir Singh Zira. “Besides supporting mafia, the MLA (Kulbir Zira) was instrumental in implicating his political opponents in criminal cases. On assuming power, our government will initiate action against him,” he said amid loud applause at the gurdwara in adjoining Makhu village. The gatherings inside the gurdwaras comprised elderly and middle-aged men and women while the youths stayed outside the shrines. A large number of police personnel in uniform and civvies were also deployed. Police didn’t allow any black piece of cloth inside the gurdwaras. Most streets leading to the political meetings were barricaded and entry of the vehicles was barred. On Thursday, Sukhbir will tour the Guru Harsahai segment in Ferozepur district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cadres-upbeat-but-farmers-angry-sukhbir-faces-ground-reality-on-day-1-101629315762045.html

The state government should not say there is no inflation,” said Chaudhary. “Prices of petrol have crossed ₹100 per litre due to the high rate of VAT in Uttar Pradesh.

However, Sarabjit Dhillon, whose wife lost the last MC elections against me, brought the work to a halt, stating that it can’t be carried out on my directions.”“We also contacted the MC officials but to no avail. Even the police tried to threaten us with an FIR. I will take up the matter with MC Commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal on Thursday and seek action against the MC officials who stopped the work on the directions of the Congress leader.

19-08-2021||Mumbai||Mosquito-borne diseases on rise in Mumbai in August||After heavy downpour in July, mosquito-borne diseases have increased drastically in August compared to the first two weeks of July. Most civic-run and private hospitals are witnessing a surge in dengue and malaria cases. Every year, on an average, around 5,500 dengue and malaria cases are recorded in the city. The highest number of cases is registered during monsoon between June and August. Last year, due to the national lockdown owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, cases were limited. But with relaxation in Covid-related lockdown restrictions, movement of people has increased along with construction work which led to a surge in mosquito-borne ailments in the city, said experts. Although the city recorded less rainfall in August compared to June, the number of monsoon-related cases is on a rise. As per data provided by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), in the first weeks of July, the city had recorded 230 malaria and eight dengue cases. Till August 15, the number surged to 395 and 61 cases, respectively. “Monsoon-related illnesses declined sharply last year due to the lockdown and minimal human activity. We are witnessing a 30%-40% increase in dengue, malaria and leptospirosis this year,” said Dr Harshad Limaye, senior consultant, internal medicine and infectious diseases, Nanavati Max Super Speciality Hospital. Dr Manjusha Agarwal, senior consultant-internal medicine at Global Hospital, Parel who has treated around 100 malaria cases this monsoon, said, “Compared to malaria cases, we are witnessing more dengue cases this monsoon.”As per medical experts, mosquito-borne diseases increase after heavy rainfall. In the rain, mosquito eggs get washed away, but when the rain subsides, water logged areas become breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Cases of other monsoon-related diseases like gastroenteritis, hepatitis and leptospirosis have also increased compared to the last month. Data from BMC shows that till July 15, the city had registered 106, 12 and 15 cases of gastroenteritis, hepatitis and leptospirosis cases, respectively. However, in the same time period in August, cases of gastroenteritis, hepatitis and leptospirosis increased to 159, 20 and 27.“There has been more than 25% increase in tropical illnesses. We are treating patients with dengue, malaria, chikungunya, seasonal flu and other viral respiratory illnesses. These tropical diseases, parasitic diseases and monsoon-related illnesses look very similar to Covid-19,” said Dr Sanjith Saseedharan, consultant and head of critical care, SL Raheja Hospital, Mahim.Although the monsoon disease trend is not worrisome, overlapping symptoms such as fever, cough and breathlessness create hurdles for accurate diagnosis of dengue, malaria, leptospirosis with that of Covid-19, said Dr Limaye. Hence, all patients have to compulsorily undergo RT-PCR or rapid antigen test to avoid any misdiagnosis. All the 27 leptospirosis cases this month have been recorded from E (Byculla), F-North (Matunga) and K-East (Andheri East) wards. To control the cases, 4,419 rat holes have been treated. “It is expected that the monsoon-related ailments would increase due to the rainfall. Thankfully, as the number of cases of Covid-19 is less, we can focus fully on other non-Covid patients. All hospitals have preserved beds for the monsoon patients,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mosquitoborne-diseases-on-rise-in-mumbai-in-august-101629314982115.html
19-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Congress workers join AAP||Several supporters of former mayor Pradeep Chhabra and Congress workers on Wednesday joined the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the presence of party’s Chandigarh affairs in-charge and MLA Jarnail Singh, president Prem Garg, Punjab MLA Kulwant Singh Pandori and general secretary Harchand Singh Barsat. Welcoming the new members, MLA Jarnail said, “After Delhi, the Congress has been reduced to zero in Chandigarh.” AAP’s Chandigarh leader Pradeep Chhabra said, “In the Chandigarh municipal corporation elections, the Congress and the BJP will be completely wiped out.” Slamming the Congress, he said the party’s Chandigarh unit was full of corrupt people. “Hardworking workers and leaders are not valued in the Congress. There is just a private company of a family, which is why Chandigarh leaders are quitting the Congress,” he added. Among the newly inducted AAP members are former Chandigarh Congress general secretary Sandeep Bhardwaj, secretaries Mushak Ali and Praveen Dugal Vishu, joint secretary Kuldeep Kumar, vice-president Rakesh Soni, SC wing vice-president Kanwaljit Singh Sidhu, DCC general secretary Jagdeep Mahajan, vice-president Dinesh Sharma, chairperson (RTI cell) Gagandeep Singh Ahluwalia, DCC vice-presidents Beant Singh and Surinder Singh, secretary Harwinder Goldy, and block presidents Harjinder Bawa and Mohinder Rajbhar. At odds with the incumbent Congress leadership, Chhabra, after resigning from the party, had recently joined AAP. Most of those who joined the AAP on Wednesday are considered Chhabra loyalists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-congress-workers-join-aap-101629314865698.html
19-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra task force lists ways to keep schoolkids safe||Distanced seating, a hybrid model of online and offline sessions to limit the number of students in class, allowing outdoor sports with limited or no contact, sensitisation of teachers and parents are some of the guidelines drafted by the nine-member paediatric task force for safe schooling amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The draft was submitted to the Maharashtra government last week. The state had planned to re-open physical classes for students from Class 5 to 8 in rural areas and Class 8 to 12 in urban areas. However, the decision was deferred on Monday. A state official said that schools have to prep for re-opening by ensuring that all teachers and staff were vaccinated and they had Covid-specific protocols in place. “The schools have to first comply with the guidelines made by the task force before they are allowed to re-open,” said the official. The pandemic has disrupted education for nearly 17 months now. Most schools have remained closed since March 2020, leaving students dabbling with online education and the lack of social contacts. The task force guidelines have taken a holistic approach by recommending protocols for distancing, sanitising, assessing the psychosocial impact on children and positioning the teachers and parents as key players to ensure that any possible Covid-19 outbreaks are quickly contained. “Earlier, if children had a minor cough or cold, parents would still send them to school, but that cannot happen anymore,” said Dr Vijay Yewale, member of the paediatric task force. “The schools will have to reduce the number of students per batch, stagger sessions, and more importantly hold meetings with parents to sensitise them. Temperature checks will have to be done at entry points and any activities that require close contact will have to be avoided,” he said. But how does one get children to stay at a distance from their friends in school? “It will be tricky, but a crucial part of safe schooling will also involve sensitising children,” said Dr Samir Dalwai, a developmental and behavioural paediatrician and member of the task force. “Students will have to be made aware about things to do when they get home from school. For example, having a bath before mingling with family members, keeping the used uniform aside for washing etc,” he said. Schools are recommended to have a 50/50 online-offline model. Experts said that the teacher-student relationship has to be more evolved in every school and teachers will have to act as Covid-19 warriors. “Teachers will have to establish individualised contact with each student. Schools on the other hand will need robust systems in place. For instance, if someone in class tests positive or is suspected for Covid-19, the school should immediately shift the child and his classmates to online classes, and get the other half of the class to attend physically,” said Dalwai. Experts say it will be hard for children to suddenly start schooling after such a long gap, and teachers should constantly counsel, and watch out for signs like irritability, anger, lack of interest, among other things.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-task-force-lists-ways-to-keep-schoolkids-safe-101629314863271.html

We expect good things from him as we have followed him on different platforms where we were able to see his past performances,” said Francisco Cardona, CEO of HNK Sibenik.Named India’s Footballer of the year last month, Jhingan is already in Croatia and watched Sunday’s home win against Hrvatski Dragovoljac.Jhingan was excited to have the opportunity to move to HNK Sibenik in the Prva HNL in Croatia. “I think I am at a stage of my career where I really want to test myself in the highest-level possible and I think this is the perfect platform for me. As I have said, it has been my desire to play in Europe and I have taken up this challenge upon myself. I cannot wait to get going and look forward to giving 100 percent at every given opportunity,” said Jhingan, who started his youth career at St Stephen’s Football Academy in Chandigarh and got a break in the top division with United Sikkim in 2011.As a young 21-year-old footballer, Jhingan first broke into prominence during the inaugural edition of ISL when he was adjudged the Emerging Player of the League in 2014, a feat that helped him earn a place in the senior India national team making his debut in 2015 against Nepal at the FIFA World Cup 2018 qualifiers. The defender has two ISL runners-up medals with Kerala Blasters FC where he spent six years and moved to ATK Mohun Bagan in 2020 after missing the previous season due to injury.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jhingan-first-indian-footballer-to-play-in-croatia-top-tier-league-101629314740328.html
19-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: All allegations baseless, says Yashwant Jadhav on alleged discrepancies in wife’s election affidavit||A day after the Income Tax (I-T) Department reportedly found discrepancies in the election affidavit filed by Shiv Sena legislator Yamini Jadhav for 2019 Assembly polls, her husband and Sena leader Yashwant Jadhav said the allegations were politically motivated ahead of BMC election. He added they have not received any communication from any central agency so far. The Shiv Sena has maintained silence on the issue. The I-T department may submit its findings to the Election Commission and seek her disqualification, which can become a major embarrassment for the ruling Shiv Sena. The I-T Department has found that a Kolkata-based shell company was used to launder ₹15 crore by Jadhavs. The findings showed that as per the affidavit filed by the candidate, she availed an unsecured loan including one from Pradhan Dealers Pvt Ltd of ₹1 crore. The department said Pradhan Dealers was found to be a shell company run and controlled from Kolkata by entry operators.Yashwant Jadhav, who is the standing committee chairman in Sena-controlled Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), said it was a political conspiracy to defame Jadhav and him ahead of BMC elections. He added that they would speak to authorities if contacted.“So far, we have not got any notice from any agency, nor have they contacted us. If the agencies get in touch, we will speak to them. This is a political conspiracy against my wife and me. All allegations against us are baseless. We are not connected to any shell companies as claimed. All our transactions are clean,” he said.This issue is expected to become another point of clash between Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of BMC polls in February 2022.Jadhav is another Sena legislator who is in the cross hairs of central agencies after Pratap Sarnaik, who faced inquiry by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Earlier, the BJP had attempted to target minister Anil Parab, who is considered close to Sena chief and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. When asked about the allegations against Jadhav, Sena chief spokesperson Arvind Sawant said he was unaware of the issue. Meanwhile, BJP leader Kirit Somaiya launched an attack on the Jadhavs and Sena saying they laundered money through companies located in United Arab Emirates (UAE).“I want to directly ask Yamini and Yashwant Jadhav if they will speak on their financial dealings with Pradhan Dealers Pvt Ltd. The Jadhav family has transferred money to two companies in UAE. But this money was deposited in their accounts by Pradhan Dealers, a Kolkata-based company,” Somaiya said in a press conference in Mumbai.Reacting to the allegations, Yashwant said, “This is politically motivated as BMC elections are approaching soon. Byculla seat was won for the first time by Yamini and this is a conspiracy to defame both of us.” When asked if the party has sought any explanation from them over the allegations, he said, “There is no question of being questioned by the party as the leadership knows that we will not indulge in anything illegal.” Despite repeated attempts, Jadhav could not be contacted. Yashwant said, “She is attending to her ailing mother, who is in a critical condition.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-all-allegations-baseless-says-yashwant-jadhav-on-alleged-discrepancies-in-wife-s-election-affidavit-101629314680355.html

19-08-2021||Mumbai||Amid BJP’s yatra, CM Thackeray expresses concern over political events||As ministers from the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Central government are holding ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’ in various parts of Maharashtra, the state cabinet on Wednesday expressed concern over the spike in Covid-19 owing to political meetings and gatherings. Meanwhile, no decision was taken on reopening of schools or allowing partially vaccinated staff to work in shopping malls. State health minister Rajesh Tope said they are not considering giving any further relaxations as of now. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in a statement after the cabinet meeting, said he is concerned over the irresponsible behaviour of a few people who are organising political, social or religious programs and putting the lives of the common people in danger. The statement assumes significance as Narayan Rane, union minister for micro, small and medium enterprises, is holding the 650-km yatra in Mumbai and Konkan. “We need to be careful while allowing political meetings and gatherings that are leading to crowding,” a senior minister reportedly said in the cabinet meeting. “The citizens should not forget that the state has relaxed some of the restrictions just to keep the economy afloat. However, the behaviour of some people is a matter of concern as they are organizing political, social, religious and other events by violating the rules and endangering lives of the common man,” Thackeray said in a statement. “We are endangering not only our own health but also of others by not following Covid rules, crowding and not wearing facial masks.” Over complaints of shortage of vaccine doses, the health minister has urged the mall associations to take the private route to get their staff vaccinated in less time. Ahead of the forthcoming local body elections, the state BJP unit is looking at an opportunity to take the central schemes to the people and expose the alleged failure of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on various fronts. For this, four new ministers — Rajya Sabha MPs Narayan Rane and Dr Bhagwat Karad, and MPs Kapil Patil and Dr Bharti Pawar — who were inducted in the Modi government as part of cabinet reshuffle on July 7 have been asked to hold ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’. They have already begun their yatra from August 16, while Rane is set to start the yatra from August 19. State BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye alleged that the BJP is being dragged for no reason whereas such political gatherings are being organized by all the three ruling parties in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amid-bjp-s-yatra-cm-thackeray-expresses-concern-over-political-events-101629314620417.html
19-08-2021||Chandigarh||Panchkula MC turns forest land into garbage dump||Violating all norms, over 12 acres of forest land has been converted into a dumping ground by the Panchkula municipal corporation (MC), posing a severe threat to wildlife and people living in the vicinity.A strong stench greets you as you cross National Highway 73, just next to the site of the city’s upcoming dumping ground. As you walk on the kuchha road, heaps of garbage and swarms of flies indicate the beginning of the land filled with the city’s waste. Cows from nearby villages, even peacocks and other wildlife animals can be seen feeding on the garbage.Notices have been issued by the wildlife and forest department, residents have moved high court, but the MC is unfazed, set upon converting the forest land into a dumping ground.“Daily, a large number of MC vehicles come to the site and dump waste, which is not segregated,” says a ragpicker, and points to syringes in the dump: “There is medical waste as well.”Close by, a seasonal drain can be seen filled with waste as well. “This merges with the big nullah and then the river,” he says.Sanctioned for waste plantPanchkula city has one other dumping ground, over 12 acres of open space, in Sector 23. This site, too, doesn’t have an “environment clearance” and is in close proximity to the Khol-Hi-Raitan Wildlife Sanctuary, forest area, residential areas and a religious site.Only after several protests, the MC had sought permission to set up a solid waste management plant in the forest area of Jurriwala village, which was granted in 2011 by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change, Northern Zone (Chandigarh).“The sanction was for a solid waste management plant, but the authorities are using the land as a dumping ground with no appropriate measures to manage waste,” says a senior officer of the forest department.The principal chief conservator of forests-cum-chief wildlife warden, Vir Bhan Singh Tanwar, says: “The MC had demanded diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes. In reply, we had sought equivalent vacant land (13.5 acres) for forest as per the Forest Conservation Act, 1980.”‘MC not paying heed to notices’“The MC has yet to deliver us the land, but has started dumping waste already. We have issued several notices, but they are not listening,” says Tanwar.“We have been protesting for more than a decade against using this site, which is just 300 metres away from the residential area of Sector 25,” says BR Gupta, president of Sector-25 RWA, adding that the Sector-23 dump had already made groundwater totally unfit for human consumption.MC commissioner Dharamvir Singh said: “For now, we are dumping waste there as the tender for solid waste management plant is yet to be floated. It will not take time.”About medical waste being thrown and animals feeding on plastic there, he said: “People should behave responsibly. They should not throw waste packed in polythene.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panchkula-mc-turns-forest-land-into-garbage-dump-101629314562570.html
19-08-2021||Mumbai||Second Covid-19 wave is under control: Maharashtra government||The second Covid-19 wave in Maharashtra is under control for now, claimed the state government on Wednesday, even as chief minister Uddhav Thackeray appealed to citizens to adopt Covid-19-appropriate behaviour to prevent a third wave, especially during the upcoming festive season. Thackeray cautioned that the second wave is not yet over.The state on Wednesday witnessed 5,132 fresh cases and 158 deaths. In a release post the meeting of the state cabinet, the government said the average weekly positivity rate has now dropped to 2.4 %. In addition, it reported that of its 36 districts, zero patients were reported in Nandurbar district, less than 10 patients in six districts and less than 100 in eight districts. The state government also said that about 50% citizens above 45 have been given at least one dose of vaccine, while in the 18-45 age group, it is 25%. Overall, over 50 million citizens have been given one dose, while 13,307,000 were fully vaccinated, as of Wednesday. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said the figures indicated the declining trend. “When positivity rate dips below 5%, it indicates that the virus has been controlled,” said Dr Awate. “The authorities apart from their standard practices of testing, contact tracing and medication also took into account the local factors to combat the virus,” he added. Thackeray, meanwhile, issued a statement, saying that he was worried about political, religious as well as social gatherings taking place in the state. “The second wave is not yet over and we have eased the lockdown, just to ensure that the economic cycle is not disrupted,” said Thackeray. “In view of the upcoming festive season, citizens should ensure that they follow all the Covid-19 rules and take all precautions to ensure that the third wave is prevented,” he added. He said not observing Covid-19 rules is harmful for both the individual as well other citizens.Mumbai saw 285 new cases and added five deaths to its toll, reaching 15,930. The total deaths in Maharashtra since the outbreak last year has reached 135,413. The number of Covid-19 patients right from the outbreak last year has now reached 6,406,345.

There is barely any space to walk or park one’s car. The worst-hit are the Jawahar Nagar market, Model Town, Gol market etc which see a huge footfall during the festival season.”Nitish, a resident of Nehru Nagar in Model Town area, said, “Some shopkeepers even encroach around 10-ft of the area outside their shops. It becomes even more difficult to cross the area on a four-wheeler. Traffic cops should be deployed in such markets during the festival season to streamline the movement of vehicle and issue challans for wrong parking.”Shopkeepers cite pandemic losses, say MC should take a lenient viewMeanwhile, shopkeepers demanded that the civic body should allow them to install vends during the festival season so as to give them a chance to recover the losses suffered during the pandemic-induced lockdown.Model Town market association president Amarjit Singh said, “We have all suffered major losses since the lockdown imposed in the country last year. The civic body should take a lenient view so that we can recover some of our losses.”He added, “I also appeal to the shopkeepers to not obstruct traffic flow as customers themselves would avoid visiting markets that have huge traffic jams.”An MC official, requesting anonymity, said the civic body has been denying permission for installing vends/stalls outside the shops for the last three years, but no action is taken against the violators due to political interference. The MC has not yet taken any decision on allowing stalls this festival season.Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “We might allow the shopkeepers to install stalls outside their shops this time, but in a limited area so that they don’t prove to be a hindrance to smooth flow of traffic. I will direct the officials to act against the violators.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ahead-of-rakhi-encroachments-galore-in-ludhiana-markets-101629314501750.html

19-08-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC grants interim protection from arrest to Raj Kundra in 2020 case||The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday granted interim protection from arrest for one week to businessman Raj Kundra in a cybercrime case from last year, which pertained to obscene content shown on OTT platforms. Kundra had approached the HC after a sessions court rejected his anticipatory bail application earlier this month.The businessman is currently in lodged in Arthur Road jail for his alleged involvement in a pornographic film racket which came to light in February, after the HC rejected his plea challenging his remand on July 19 in that case. Kundra’s application stated that two other accused in the case had been granted protection and he sought the same on grounds of parity. The HC granted the state’s request for a week to respond. Kundra’s lawyer Shishir Gupte informed the single bench of justice S K Shinde during the anticipatory bail application that the First Information Report (FIR) registered by the cyber cell of Mumbai police in October 2020 did not mention Kundra’s name, and he was falsely implicated by the police. The FIR was registered under Indian Penal Code section dealing with sale of obscene material, sections of the Information Technology Act which deal with transmission of sexually explicit material and provisions of the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act. Gupte submitted that the Cyber police was trying to establish his connection with a mobile application, Hotshots. The app is one of the many that is currently under the scanner of the Crime Branch, investigating the February pornography racket. The CB has arrested at least 11 persons – including Kundra and associate Ryan Thorpe -- in connection with the racket, in which allegedly pornographic films and videos were produced and disseminated over subscription-driven websites and apps. The investigation has revealed so far that a company founded by Kundra in 2019 created Hotshots, which it later sold to a UK-based firm that is owned by Kundra’s relative, Pradeep Bakshi. Gupte told the court that Kundra had invested in the venture for a brief period and discontinued his association in December 2019. He further stated that during this association Kundra was not involved in the contracts or content created by the company. Gupte said that since the HC had already granted interim protection to other co-accused, Sherlyn Chopra and Poonam Pandey, and the police had already seized electronic devices belonging to Kundra in another case, his custodial interrogation was not required and hence his application for pre-arrest bail should be allowed. Additional public prosecutor Prajakta Shinde opposed the application on the grounds that Kundra’s role in both cases was different from the co-accused and hence he could not seek similar relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-grants-interim-protection-from-arrest-to-raj-kundra-in-2020-case-101629314260361.html
19-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Private schools want physical classes for younger students too||With classroom teaching now allowed for students in Class 7 and above, private schools in Chandigarh want physical classes to resume for the younger students as well. The Independent School Association (ISA), which represents around 75 private schools of the city, has taken up the matter with the Chandigarh administration. However, the education department maintained that there is no immediate plan to call primary class students back to school.“Globally, we have seen schools were reopened for the younger students first, as it an important age for learning. Their education is getting affected, and we want physical classes to be allowed at primary stage, though on voluntary basis,” said HS Mamik, president, ISA. Atul Khanna, director, Strawberry Fields High School, Sector 26, said: “With new cases on a low, now is the right time to try reopening classes for younger students as well. Schools can be asked to ensure that both teaching and non-teaching staff are vaccinated, and in case there is a spike in cases, schools can be asked to shut down again.”However, parents are divided on the issue. Nitin Goyal, president, Chandigarh Parents Association, said: “There are many parents who are still paranoid about sending their children to school. However, over the months, the number of parents who want schools to reopen has gone up.” Goyal said even if primary classes are reopened, attendance should remain voluntary and online teaching should continue, as being done for Classes 7-12.Rubinderjit Singh Brar, director, school education, Chandigarh, said the education department is right now focusing on classroom teaching for students in Classes 7-12. “There is no immediate plan to call primary class students back to school,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-private-schools-want-physical-classes-for-younger-students-too-101629314140300.html

Nearly 2,000 people are getting vaccinated at these two hospitals daily, according to the Chandigarh health department.“Migrant population, especially those living in Baddi and Solan in Himachal Pradesh, have to make regular visits to Punjab to work in industries. After the Punjab government’s announcement, they are visiting the two government hospitals in Chandigarh in huge numbers, as they feel that vaccine may not be easily available at their local centres,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director, health services, Chandigarh, while dispelling rumours about free vaccination being discontinued in thehill state.According to the latest electoral list, around 7,29,822 people in Chandigarh are above the age of 18 and are eligible to get vaccinated. As on Wednesday, 7,50,062 (104%), including migrants, had taken their first shot while 2,59,816 (36%) were fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-sees-influx-of-migrants-for-vaccination-101629314021430.html

19-08-2021||Chandigarh||HC refuses to accept compromise between accused and rape victim, says allegations are of heinous crime||The Punjab and Haryana high court has refused to accept a compromise between a woman and a person whom she had accused of rape.The court of justice Rajesh Bhardwaj observed that the petitioner is alleged to have committed a “heinous offence” and had established physical relations with the woman forcefully by blackmailing her. “The allegations levelled in the FIR make out cognisable offence and truth can be unravelled only after leading the evidences before the trial court,” the bench said, adding that in court’s opinion, interference by the HC on the basis of alleged compromise is not called for. The FIR was registered in July 2019 on allegations of rape in Faridabad. The petitioner had approached the HC in July with a compromise deed between the woman and the accused effected the same month. As per the case, allegations were that the woman, 28, is married and became familiar with the accused. Thereafter, in due course of time, taking benefit of the relations, he started forcing her and established physical relations repeatedly. On resistance, the woman was threatened that he would upload her photos on Facebook and kill her husband, she had alleged, adding that having no other alternative, at one point of time, she had disclosed the same to her husband, who got the FIR registered. The accused had claimed that both the parties have amicably settled the dispute and have arrived at a compromise. And in view of this, carrying on with his prosecution would be an abuse of the process of the law and thus the same deserves to be quashed. The police had opposed the plea stating that the offence involved is heinous and on completion of investigation the challan already stands submitted before the trial court and further the compromise alleged has no legal sanctity. The court took note of SC observations that in case of heinous offences, the compromise arrived would be meaningless. It also took note of the fact that allegations against him were of forcefully establishing physical relations repeatedly by blackmailing her of posting her photos on Facebook and killing her husband.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-refuses-to-accept-compromise-between-accused-and-rape-victim-says-allegations-are-of-heinous-crime-101629313840255.html

The fifth plant is being set up at the IOCL’s Panipat refinery and will generate ethanol from paddy waste.As per the project details, work on these plants was to complete by August this year but was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdowns. But officials working on the projects said all four biomass plants will be completed by end of the year and trials are likely in November, whereas IOCL’s 2G ethanol plant will be completed by March next year.After being made operational, the biomass plants will generate a total of 49.8 MW electricity or 26 crore units by consuming 5.87 lakh MT of paddy waste generated from around 2.90 lakh acre.Similarly, the ethanol plant will directly produce 100 kilo litre ethanol per day from 425.5 MT dried rice straw and provide relief from the emission by consuming the paddy waste of around 80,000 acre every year.The expected cost of the project is around ₹766 crore and the plant is spread in 34 acre on premises of the Panipat refinery.The IOCL officials said the project is based on indigenously developed technology and will not leave any waste behind.Besides 150 technical experts, this plant will provide employment to about 1,200 people including village-level entrepreneurs and supply chain management.Haryana new and renewable energy department additional chief secretary PK Das said, “These plants will prove to be game-changer by converting crop waste into energy and fuel. We are facing stubble burning issue but using technology, this will provide double benefit apart from providing extra income to farmers.”As per ground-level officers, private companies have made arrangements of land, employees, machines and paddy waste. “In return, the government will purchase electricity from these companies as per government policy,” said Balwan Singh Golan, HAREDA project officer, Kurukshetra.He said these private companies have been allowed to purchase crop waste directly from farmers and will pay around ₹1,000-1,500 per acre to farmers.THE BURNING ISSUEAs per officials of the state pollution control board, stubble burning contributes to about 48% of total emission in Haryana and Punjab. These waste-to-energy plants will provide a huge relief by consuming millions of tonnes of crop waste.Haryana is the second biggest producer of paddy waste in country after Punjab and faces criticism for failure to put a check on the incidents of stubble burning, which affect the air quality of NCR.As per figures, of 13 lakh hectare under paddy in Haryana, about 7 lakh hectare is harvested by combine harvesters leaving 50 quintal crop waste per hectare behind.And despite government providing subsidised implements for straw management, keeping a check on stubble burning remains a challenge.Haryana reported 5,678 active fire locations in 2020 kharif season as compare to 9,225 and 6,364 in 2018 and 2019, respectively.S Narayanan, member secretary to HSPCB, said, “A number of biogas plants are planned in Haryana with a capacity of around 422 tonnes per day which can utilise around 5 lakh MT paddy straw. These projects can help the state combat crop residue burning,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/haryanas-waste-to-energy-plants-may-be-key-to-resolve-stubble-burning-issue-101629313663254.html

The court has issued notice to jail superintendents to present Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim and another accused Krishan Lal via video conferencing on the next date of hearing.Ranjit Singh, a former follower of Ram Rahim, was shot dead by four assailants on July 10, 2002 at his native Khanpur Kolian village in Kurukshetra after he “raised his voice” against the Dera head.Four years ago, on August 25, 2017, Ram Rahim was convicted of rape by a special CBI court and on August 27, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison.Following the verdict, Panchkula witnessed the biggest riots of the state that left 36 dead and 423 injured as mobs of followers of Ram Rahim went on a rampage after the CBI special court found him guilty of raping two women disciples.Police record shows that 29 buildings, government and private, were damaged. The dera followers burnt 74 vehicles including two fire tenders, three outstation broadcasting (OB) vans of news channels, one school bus and damaged 57 vehicles, including one ambulance.The Panchkula police also seized five pistols/revolvers, four rifles including an AK 47, two guns, one Mauser, and 58 vehicles.In January 2019, Ram Rahim and three others were convicted of murder and criminal conspiracy of journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati and sentenced to life imprisonment.With Ram Rahim already being convicted in two cases and serving life imprisonment in Sunaria jail, thousands of people are now eyeing the third judgment.Earlier the date of order was fixed for August 23, however, special public prosecutor HPS Verma filed an application seeking two weeks time for filling rebuttal as he requires assistance of the investigating officer, who has retired.Judge Dr Sushil Kumar Garg denied two weeks time but granted five days till August 23 and order on August 24. He also directed that both accused be present in person.However, district attorney requested that even at the time of pronouncement of verdict against the Dera chief on January 11, 2019, Sunaria jail superintendent was directed to produce Ram Rahim through VC.“So, in the present case too, it is requested that presence of the accused be allowed through VC on account of law and order situation at the time of pronouncement of the order,” he requested.The attorney informed the court that Vidhan Sabha session is also scheduled from August 20 to August 25 and that law and machinery will remain busy during this period.He said as the case is highly sensitive, it is requested that the date fixed be adjourned to any other date after August 25. Following which, the date was adjourned to August 26, and the superintendent of district jail, Sunaria (Rohtak), and central jail, Ambala, were directed to ensure presence of accused Ram Rahim and Krishan Lal through VC.The public prosecutors can address their arguments in rebuttal on August 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/order-in-ranjit-singh-murder-case-on-aug-26-101629313600265.html

MMC then suspended licenses issued to some of the doctors and prohibited many of them from practising for certain time period.Majority of the certificates were related to courses conducted by a Parel-based college and included diploma in gynaecology and obstetrics, diploma in ophthalmology, diploma in general surgery, diploma in cardiology, and fellowship in surgery and medicine.“As and when we saw anything wrong, we have reported it to the police and other agencies,” said Dr Shivkumar Uttare, president of MMC.MMC said it had to register a case as forgery was a criminal offence and it becomes more serious when medical professionals are involved in such practices as human lives are at stake.The 42 doctors have been booked for cheating, forgery, forgery of valuable security, forgery for purpose of cheating, using as genuine a forged document or electronic record, common intention.During interrogation, the doctors said paediatrician Dr Snehal Nyati helped them procure the fake certificates for an amount between ₹3 lakh ad ₹5 lakh. Nyati was arrested earlier in a similar case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/42-doctors-booked-for-submitting-fake-certificates-to-mmc-one-arrested-101629313360231.html
19-08-2021||Chandigarh||Security lapse: Dera head gets to see visitors during out-of-prison medical check-ups||The security detail of incarcerated head of the Dera Sacha Sauda sect, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, who is serving a 20-year sentence, seems to have gone out of line by allowing unauthorised access of visitors including two women to the Dera head during his travels for medical examination.The deviation not only amounted to compromising the security of a high-risk prisoner but also has raised questions on the conduct of security officials in providing favours to the controversial sect head citing directions from “someone in Chandigarh”.The matter has been conveyed to the higher police authorities by Rohtak superintendent of police (SP) Rahul Sharma and additional director general of police (ADGP), Rohtak Range, Sandeep Khirwar in separate communications last month.The two officials have recommended initiation of departmental action against Meham deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Shamsher Dahiya for deliberately allowing lapses. Dahiya was the officer in-charge of the security detail during some of the recent out-of-prison visits of Dera head.WOMEN BOARDED DERA HEAD’S VEHICLE ENROUTE ROHTAKA few other cops who were part of the Dera chief’s security detail have also flagged the intentional security lapses.DSP Sajjan Kumar, in a communication to the Rohtak SP, wrote that during a July 13 visit to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, four persons including two women were given unauthorised access to meet the Dera chief on the hospital premises.Kumar said when he objected to the presence of these persons citing security risks and protocol, he was told by Dahiya that he got a phone call from Chandigarh to facilitate the meeting of the Dera head with these persons.DSP Kumar said after completion of medical examination and tests at AIIMS, the Dera chief boarded Dahiya’s vehicle on the way back to Rohtak prison. As per Kumar’s communication, the vehicle with Dera chief on board made multiple unscheduled stops enroute where two women were also allowed to board the vehicle.Kumar wrote that while Dahiya claimed of getting telephonic directions from Chandigarh to facilitate the access, he felt that it was a mere ploy to mislead his fellow cops.Director general of police (DGP) PK Agarwal said such incidents amount to serious misconduct and breach of professional ethics. “We are moving the case to state government for placing the errant DSP under suspension and initiation of disciplinary proceedings,” he said.THREAT PERCEPTION, LAW AND ORDER PROBLEMConsidering the threat he faced from Sikh radicals, the Dera head was given the apex Z plus security cover during the Congress rule. In fact, till 2017, when the BJP was in power, he was the only individual in state besides the governor and the chief minister to have the highest protection.His cover was withdrawn in 2017 after he was convicted and sentenced for 20 years for raping women followers.“Such deliberate acts of compromising the security of a high-risk prisoner can have serious repercussions. If something goes wrong, such misadventures can snowball into a law-and-order crisis considering the kind of following the Dera head has in Haryana and Punjab. The government is ill-equipped to handle such situations,” said a former CID official, who had handled the Dera chief’s security paraphernalia.GOVT PLAYING VOTE-BANK POLITICS: CHATTRAPATIAnshul Chattrapati, son of slain journalist Ram Chander Chattarapati for whose murder the Dera head has also been sentenced for life, said the Dera head being allowed such liberties is a serious matter.“The state government has a lot to answer. I had written to the chief justice of Punjab and Haryana high court that the Dera head was misusing his political links to obtain paroles one after another thereby nullifying the process of law and mocking the process of natural justice,” he said.“In May, he was allowed to stay at a farmhouse in Manesar. When he was admitted to a Gurugram hospital, he insisted that his devotee Honeypreet Kaur be allowed to take care of him. How many prisoners in state get such VVIP treatment? The state is lending him a helping hand purely for vote-bank politics,” he added.Principal media advisor to the Haryana chief minister, Vinod Mehta, however, said the state government has not favoured the Dera head in any way.“Since he has medical problems which cannot be ignored, the Dera head was taken to Delhi as those tests could only be conducted at AIIMS. The paroles have been granted as per rules, keeping in mind his medical condition,” Mehta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/security-lapse-dera-head-gets-to-see-visitors-during-out-of-prison-medical-checkups-101629313184856.html

He returned home via Qatar and Kuwait with the support of US Air Force. “Our base camp was located about 8-10 km from Pul-e-Charkhi, the biggest prison in Kabul and employed 60 people. Among them were five Indians, 35 Americans and 20 British nationals. Two hours before the Taliban reached Kabul on August 14 night, US embassy ordered that we vacate the camp,” he recalled while talking to HT on phone from Pratapgarh.“Before leaving the camp, we took back-up of the entire data on our computers and destroyed around 200 laptops. Forty vehicles of the US army were burnt to prevent them from falling in the hands of the Taliban. After this, six Chinook helicopters of the US Army got us airlifted to the airport,” he shared.“We were then flown to Doha (Qatar) by a US Air Force plane on the night of August 15. After staying there for the next day, we reached Kuwait and finally managed to land at New Delhi on Tuesday night,” he said. “It is not that Taliban is not being welcomed by the locals but at the same time there is substantial population which wants to escape for better opportunity as they feel their future is bleak in Afghanistan,” he said. He said Indian government is evacuating Indians from different locations in Afghanistan.“There are many Indians still in Afghanistan and they need to be taken to safety as soon as possible,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/airlifted-by-us-army-from-afghanistan-pratapgarh-s-it-engineer-returns-home-101629313063169.html
19-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Kasturba hospital to start genome sequencing from this week||Two weeks after installation of genome sequencing machines in their laboratory, Kasturba Gandhi Hospital in Byculla is likely to start conducting tests to identify variants of Sars-CoV-2 — the virus that causes Covid-19 — by this weekend. The hospital will be the first civic-run facility to conduct genome sequencing in Mumbai.Genome sequencing is an exercise to study the changes in the structure of the virus over time. A combination of changes in the ribonucleic acid of the virus can give birth to a new variant.The genome sequencing machines were inaugurated on August 4 by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. At present, molecular diagnostic reference laboratory of the hospital is completing the process of installing the machines. Dr Jayanti Shastri, in-charge of the laboratory, said, “We are just completing validation of the machines. These will start testing this week.”With 11 Delta Plus variants identified in Mumbai, genome sequencing will help boost identification of Delta and Delta Plus variants in the city. Currently, it takes more than two-three months to get test results of genome sequencing which delays the epidemiological study of the mutated virus in infected patients. With this laboratory, results will be available within three-four days.“The samples will be collected through the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) from international passengers, Covid-19 hotspots, places with high transmission rate, among others,” said Dr Shastri.HT had earlier reported that due to Covid-19 restrictions on international cargo ferrying, the hospital had to wait for months to get the machines from Chicago. The machines have been procured through donations that cumulatively cost around ₹10.5 crore. A US-based biotech company has donated ₹6.4 crore, while Mumbai-based ATE Chandra Foundation donated ₹4 crore for the machine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-kasturba-hospital-to-start-genome-sequencing-from-this-week-101629312941635.html

19-08-2021||Mumbai||Extortion case against Param Bir Singh transferred to Maharashtra CID||The extortion case registered by Marine Drive police against former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh and eight others including six police officers has been transferred for further investigation to Maharashtra criminal investigation department (CID). The case was being investigated by a special investigation team (SIT). A senior officer, who was part of the SIT, confirmed the development and said, “The official order has come from the government but papers related to the case are yet to be handed over to state CID”. The SIT was formed in the last week of July to probe two first information reports (FIR), one of which was registered at Marine Drive police station in July against Singh, crime branch deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Akbar Pathan and five other cops based on a complaint by Bhayander-based builder Shyamsunder Agrawal who alleged ₹15-crore extortion by Singh and his subordinates. The other is a Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) case registered by Juhu police against Agrawal in February for his alleged links with underworld gangster Chhota Shakeel. Agrawal has alleged that based on this false case, Singh and his subordinates extorted money from him at the behest of his former business partner Sanjay Punamiya.Only the Marine Drive case has been transferred to CID while the MCOCA case is still with SIT for investigation, said a police officer.The SIT is headed by a DCP-rank officer while an assistant commissioner of police (ACP)-rank officer would be the chief investigation officer. The SIT will directly report to Mumbai Police chief Hemant Nagrale and joint commissioner of police, law and order, Vishwas Nangre Patil.Singh is currently facing four FIRs — one with Marine Drive police, while three other FIRs are being investigated by the Thane Police.According to the FIR at Marine Drive police station, the complainant Agrawal, 57, claimed he had done several real estate projects in Borivli, Bhayander and Gorai between 2016 and 2011 in partnership with Punamiya, but due to complications, conflicts and profit-sharing disputes, the two ended their partnership in 2011. He alleged that Punamiya has been registering false cases against him since then and has filed 18 such cases in Mumbai and Thane. Agrawal has cleared his name in 14 of these cases.In the MCOCA case, Punamiya alleged that Agrawal threatened him for extortion at the behest of gangster Chhota Shakeel between November 2016 and December 2020. MCOCA sections were invoked in the case in March 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/extortion-case-against-param-bir-singh-transferred-to-maharashtra-cid-101629312341013.html
19-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Soon, pay fine for dumping malba at undesignated sites||Dumping of the construction and demolition (C&D) waste at public places will soon invite heavy penalty in Chandigarh. User chargers will also have to be paid for mandatory transfer of the C&D waste (known locally as malba) from the construction site to the designated processing site.The UT administration on Wednesday finalised the draft Chandigarh Construction and Demolition Waste Management Policy, 2021.

The authority to issue challan will rest with the subdivisional engineer/junior engineer of the road wing or enforcement inspectors of the MC.If any question relating to the interpretation of the policy arises, it will be referred to the MC commissioner, whose decision will be final and binding upon. No appeal thereto in any court of law is maintainable, states the draft.DutiesEvery waste generator shall be responsible for collection and segregation of the waste.No waste generator will dump C&D waste at undesignated sites.Bulk generators (more than 20 tonnes daily or 300 tonne per project in a month) shall segregate the waste into four streams: concrete; steel; wood and plastics; bricks and mortar.It is made mandatory to cover the construction area to avoid air pollution by particulate matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-soon-pay-fine-for-dumping-malba-at-undesignated-sites-101629312220285.html
19-08-2021||Mumbai||BMC approves ₹700-cr project for 11 oxygen plants, underground tunnels in Mithi||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) standing committee on Wednesday approved two projects worth around ₹700 crore including setting up of 11 oxygen plants in the city and construction of two tunnels below Mithi river to ensure it does not get clogged.As per the proposal passed by the standing committee, oxygen plants will come up at 10 locations at a cost of ₹204 crore. This includes locations like Dahisar jumbo centre, BKC jumbo centre. BMC had earlier awarded the contract for installing oxygen plants at nine locations in the city where 16 plants were installed. During the peak of second wave, city’s oxygen demand was of 235 metric tonnes a day, and considering this figure, BMC has been making arrangements to prepare for a possible third wave.Further, the ₹500-crore project for constructing two tunnels will help prevent pollution in Mithi river which has been facing sewage discharge and wastewater from industries and slums along its bank.According to the proposal, construction of a 6.7-km tunnel, from Bapat nullah and Safed Pool nullah up to proposed sewage treatment plant at Dharavi, is expected to be completed in 48 months. While the tunnel from Bapat Nullah will have capacity of 78-million litres of sewage collection, at Safed Pool nullah it can handle 90-million litres of sewage daily. The tunnel will pass from 20 to 25 metres below the ground. Some portions of the tunnel will also pass through mangrove areas for which the project will require environmental clearance.Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has slammed BMC for awarding the oxygen plants contract without making any calculations. Vinod Mishra, standing committee member from BJP, said, “BMC is completely non-transparent on what basis they are coming up with so many oxygen plants. We do need plants, but there are several questions which they need to answer. Such as how many plants are needed and how much oxygen is needed? What is the pressure of oxygen produced by the plant? And will this pressure be useful for ICU patients? We have pointed out mal practices previously in appointing contractor for oxygen plants. BMC should come out clear on it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-approves-700-cr-project-for-11-oxygen-plants-underground-tunnels-in-mithi-101629312160258.html
19-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Kansal man let off in rape case||Stating that failure to fulfil a promise cannot be construed to mean the promise itself was false, a fast-track special court in Chandigarh has acquitted a man from the charge of rape on the pretext of marriage.The court also observed that the physical relationship between the couple was “not isolated or sporadic in nature but regular over the years”, while giving relief to the man, identified as Varun Kumar of Kansal village.The woman had alleged that she met Varun at a coaching centre in May 2013, and he made forcible physical relations with her for at least four years, and she had to undergo abortion in 2017.After he got engaged to someone else the following month, she filed a complaint alleging that he had raped her on the pretext of marriage. On January 24, 2018, Varun was charged under Section 376 (2) (n) of the Indian Penal Code. It pertains to repeated rape of a woman and can lead to rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than 10 years and can extend up to the convict’s natural death.Man’s parents were against marriageDuring the trial, Varun said that his parents were against their inter-caste marriage, and even she was aware about it. He had to end the relationship after his parents threatened to disown him and even commit suicide, he told court.Stating that the rape allegations were just to pressure him into marriage, Varun said the physical relations between them were neither on the pretext of marriage nor forcible but “on account of their friendship and liking for each other”. Court questions veracity of allegationsJudge Swati Sehgal observed that the woman had alleged of being raped at a public park in Sector 22, Chandigarh, which was “highly improbable” as the park is very crowded in evenings and the complainant could not produce any documentary evidence.The court also observed that the physical relationship that followed was not isolated, and lodging a case after four years of the alleged first incident of rape and a month after the man’s engagement raised serious doubts about the truth and veracity of the woman’s allegations.“Failure of the accused to fulfil his promise cannot be construed to mean the promise itself was false. Woman was aware of obstacles in their relationship but still engaged in sexual relations,” the judge further said.Acquitting the man, she observed: “The nature and manner of allegations coupled with the messages exchanged between them, marked as exhibit during the trial, make it apparent that their love for each other grew and matured over a sufficient period of time and the passion of youth ruled over their mind and emotions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-kansal-man-let-off-in-rape-case-101629311981370.html

He told me that around 28 people from various districts of Uttar Pradesh were trapped in the factory. The owner of the factory, a resident of Afghanistan, assured them safety, food and lodging,” he said.“My brother panicked after a Taliban commander visited the factory along with fighters on Tuesday. The commander told my brother and other people from Uttar Pradesh that Afghanistan was now under the control of the Taliban and that Islamic law had been enforced in the country. Everyone has to follow the new law, else they should be ready to face the consequences,” Maurya said, adding that the passports of all the stranded workers were in the custody of the factory owner who assured to return them once the work in the unit was completed.Maurya said he will also approach Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath to ensure the safe return of his brother and others.Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said the state government is in constant touch with over 300 of its residents who have been issuing fervent pleas to be evacuated from the land-locked country.In videos sent to their family members in Uttarakhand, a group of ex-servicemen who used to work with private security agencies to assist the now-collapsed Ashraf Ghani-led administration are seen pleading with the central government for their safe return.The men claimed that they were stranded in major cities such as Kabul, Kandahar and Herat.On Wednesday, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee claimed that more 200 people from north Bengal were stranded in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/migrants-trapped-in-kabul-fear-taliban-threats-as-families-worry-for-them-101629311321204.html
19-08-2021||Delhi||Sunanda Pushkar death case: Probe centered on autopsy report by AIIMS docs panel||he post-mortem exam report of Sunanda Pushkar initially raised more questions than it answered with the preliminary assessment saying it was a ‘sudden unnatural death’, but it was never made clear what it meant. It remained inconclusive on the explanation even after two days of extension that the doctors had sought.Pushkar, then 51, was found dead inside a luxury suite of Hotel Leela Palace in south Delhi on January 17, 2014.As it was an SDM inquest, the then director AIIMS, Dr MC Misra, constituted a three-member panel of forensic medicine experts that was headed by Dr Sudhir Gupta to perform the post-mortem. The entire autopsy procedure was videographed, as is the protocol in medico-legal cases.Two days after Pushkar’s autopsy was conducted at AIIMS, the hospital submitted the preliminary report to the then sub-divisional magistrate, Alok Sharma, investigating her death, in a sealed envelope.The report submitted appeared to say that Pushkar’s death was not due to natural causes but due to poisoning. Public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava relied on the post-mortem exam report to argue that it was not an accidental death but poisoning which could be administered orally or injected.Asked about the attention that his report garnered at that time, Dr Gupta on Wednesday said, “After we submit a post-mortem report to the police, our job is done. Unless the court has some specific questions, there is no legal provision for forensics to give their opinion to the court.”However, the doctors later also clarified that the autopsy report never mentioned it was a “homicide, and it was for the investigating agencies to ascertain what the manner of poisoning was and the substance used”.“Whether the death is a murder or a suicide or an accident, it is always for the investigation agency to determine; forensic medicine experts are there to give out the possible causes that may help the investigators,” Dr Gupta said then.Pushkar’s viscera samples (internal organs) were sent to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation laboratory for further analysis to determine the kind of poison, as the AIIMS report did not mention any specific substance.The 11-page FBI report found traces of an anti-anxiety drug, corroborating AIIMS findings. Besides traces of Alprax, the FBI lab also found an anesthetic drug ‘Lidocaine Gel’, used to relieve itching, burning and pain due to skin inflammation.The conclusions of the post-mortem report came into limelight after Dr Gupta alleged that he was pressured to change the report to say that it was a natural death. He reportedly wrote to the then union health minister JP Nadda stating, “Dr Misra (AIIMS director) asked me to declare Sunanda Pushkar’s death as natural in the post-mortem report, which is contrary to the findings…”When asked for a comment on his letter, Dr Gupta on Wednesday said, “These are all matters of the past.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sunanda-pushkar-death-case-how-the-autopsy-report-thickened-plot-around-death-101629310659420.html
19-08-2021||Delhi||Sunanda death case: Several twists and turns in years of investigation||Between the evening of February 17, 2014 when Sunanda Pushkar was found dead inside Hotel Leela Palace in south Delhi, and the afternoon of May 14, 2018, when the police charged her husband Shashi Tharoor in the case, three police commissioners supervised the investigation. What was initially suspected to be a case of poisoning, according to the police, became a murder case and then suicide by an overdose of anti-depressants. During the tenure of the three police chiefs --- BS Bassi, Alok Verma and Amulya Patnaik -- the cause of Pushkar’s death and the motive for her alleged murder, changed each time the three men were heading the force.On Wednesday, a city court discharged Congress member of Parliament Tharoor in the case of domestic violence and abetting his wife’s suicide -- charges that Delhi police filed against him in their charge sheet after four years on May 1, 2018. Usually, police have to file their charge sheet within three months.HT takes a look at all the controversies over the police’s investigation over the years.Case transferLess than a week after Pushkar was found dead, the Delhi police transferred the case to the crime branch on the morning of June 23. Until then, the case was being investigated by the south district police.The decision was reversed even before the crime branch officials could get the case files. Police then said that the case will be continued to be probed by the south district staff. The then joint commissioner of police, Vivek Gogia, who was the head of the southeastern range supervised the investigation. Gogia is currently the joint director at the National Crime Records Bureau(NCRB). A special investigation team of the local south district police filed the charge sheet in the case.Crime scene visited again after yearsThe hotel suite where Pushkar was found dead was sealed for over three years. On July 17, 2017, a city court ordered the police to complete the investigation and de-seal the room. The room was finally de-sealed in October 2017. Interestingly, while there were no major developments in the case, the police team visited the room many times in all those years. The last was on September 1, 2017, when they collected “ more evidence”. One such piece of evidence was a half-filled glass of water, which was never collected by the investigating officers. The glass was then sent to the forensic science laboratory. Police also collected broken glass pieces from Pushkar’s room, months after the incident.Murder or suicideFor almost a year, Delhi police did not register a First Information Report(FIR) in the case. On January 6, the then Delhi police commissioner BS Bassi announced registration of an FIR as the death “seemed unnatural and could be due to poisoning”. Bassi did not specify how the poison was administered. The FIR also did not name Tharoor or any other person. To be sure, Tharoor was never arrested in the case or charged with Pushkar’s murder.Bassi did not wish to comment on the case or Wednesday’s court order.Charge sheet on abetment of suicide While police continued to probe Pushkar’s death as that of ‘murder’ for almost three years, the charge sheet they filed on May 14, 2018, invoked abetting suicide and domestic violence against Tharoor. Police then mentioned an overdose of Alprax tablets as the cause of her death. While denying the charges, Tharoor then said that he will “vigorously” contest the police’s charge sheet. Tharoor had termed the police’s charge sheet preposterous. When the charge sheet was filed, Amulya Patnaik was the Delhi police commissioner.IPL and Mehr Trar probed Besides contradictory investigation and charge sheet, Delhi police widened their gaze and probed Pushkar’s death from the angle of the Indian Premier League controversy. As part of the investigation, the then police commissioner Bassi had asked the Economic Offences Wing to prober financial irregularities related to the Kochi-IPL franchise. Tharoor had resigned as union minister during the 2010 IPL controversy after allegations of corruption linking him to the Kochi-IPL franchise. Pushkar was alleged to have received stakes for free when Tharoor was the minister in the United Progressive Alliance II government. To be sure, the Delhi police never charged Tharoor or Pushkar in the case, even as the then commissioner was quoted in print and television media about police quizzing Tharoor on the IPL controversy.As part of their investigation, two years after Pushkar’s death, Delhi police also questioned Pakistan-based journalist Mehr Tarar because Pushkar had a public spat with her on twitter just days before her death. To be sure, Tarar said that her name was dragged into the case, only because she had chatted with Pushkar on twitter. At this time, former CBI director Alok Verma was the Delhi police commissioner.Crime scene tampered withA vigilance report to probe the conduct of the investigating officers pointed out lapses in the investigation and noted that the crime scene was tampered with. Used plates in her room were not collected by the investigating officers on the day of the incident. Pushkar’s body was also moved from one room to the other. The vigilance enquiry was ordered in the backdrop of such findings. Delhi police have officially not revealed the findings of the report till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sunanda-death-case-several-twists-and-turns-in-years-of-investigation-101629310540937.html
19-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt gives nod to action plan to phase out single-use plastic||New Delhi: The Delhi government on Wednesday approved a comprehensive action plan detailing steps to be taken by various agencies by December 2022 to phase out single-use plastic from the Capital.Senior Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) officials said that the “Comprehensive Action Plan for Elimination of Identified Single-Use Plastic” includes strict deadlines for the stakeholders to adhere to, adding that the progress will be closely monitored by the pollution control board.“The draft action plan was prepared last week, and we were awaiting its approval. We have been having detailed meetings with all stakeholders on the effective implementation of the ban,” said an environment department official.The Union environment ministry notified the Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules (2021) that prohibits the manufacture, import, stocking, distribution, sale and use of identified single-use plastic items on August 12. The rules said the permitted thickness of plastic bags, currently 50 microns, will be increased to 75 microns from September 30 this year and to 120 microns from December 31, 2022.It also banned several single-use plastic items like earbuds with plastic sticks; plastic sticks for balloons; plastic flags; candy and ice-cream sticks; polystyrene (thermocol) for decoration; glasses; cutlery; wrapping or packing films around sweet boxes, invitation cards, and cigarette packets; and plastic or PVC banners of less than 100-micron thickness. The ban on these will come into force from July 1 next year.In May this year, Delhi constituted a special task force, under the chief secretary, to take measures to eliminate single-use plastics. Later in June and August, the principal secretary (environment) convened consultation meetings with stakeholders to identify and adopt alternatives to single-use plastic.Earlier in August,an information, education and communication (IEC) plan for different stakeholders, including manufacturers, resident welfare associations, market associations, was also prepared by DPCC to discourage the use of items that use single-use plastic.The comprehensive action plan approved on Wednesday details various steps to be taken to phase out single-use plastic, the time frames -- divided short, medium, long term or continuous action -- for each action, deadlines and the agencies responsible for the task.For instance, under the “management of littered single-use plastic items” in the action plan, one of the tasks --“identification of ingress points of littered single-use plastic items in surface water bodies and drains and strategy for prevention” -- has to be completed by October 31, 2021, by the urban local bodies, Delhi Jal Board and the Irrigation and Flood Control Departments.Other deadlines include the assessment of district-wise plastic waste generation in Delhi by March 31, 2022; identification and closure of units manufacturing single-use plastic products by June 30, 2022; development of a database of plastic recyclers by December 31, 2021; and a ‘continuous’ task of implementation of a plan to manage location-wise legacy waste.An assessment by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) this year showed that 66% of the plastic waste generated in the country is coming from seven states alone. It further said Delhi, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and West Bengal, “followed a highly consumerist lifestyle” and generated 48% of the total plastic waste.Atin Biswas, programme director (solid waste management) at CSE, said, “The test will be how the states implement this ban. These items are so widely in use that we will need a comprehensive and effective plan to phase out single-use plastic. Enforcement will have to be backed by awareness.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-gives-nod-to-action-plan-to-phase-out-single-use-plastic-101629310240302.html
19-08-2021||Delhi||Traders worry as Afghan crisis likely to hit dry fruit supplies to Delhi market||The current crisis in Afghanistan has thrown traders of Old Delhi’s Khari Baoli market into a state of uncertainty, with most of them speculating unstable supplies and rise in prices of dry fruits that arrive from the strife-torn country – which has been taken over by the Taliban militia -- in the days to come.The Mughal-era market -- popular for wholesale trade of spices, dry fruits and food grains -- gets around 35,000 tonnes of dry fruits from Afghanistan in a year on average. The most popular among them are fig (anjeer), raisins, apricots, manukka and varieties of nuts and pistachio, said traders in Khari Baoli.“Currently, prices are up by around 8% - 10% but that is due to a wide variety of reasons, such as the festive season ahead, starting with Raksha Bandhan, rainfall in several parts of the country, and increased transportation and storage cost because of the Covid-19 pandemic. There is too much uncertainty because of the situation in Afghanistan. Prices may shoot up with the disruption in the supply chain,” said Ravindra Mehta, a consultant for import of dry fruits.On Wednesday, Afghan fig in the market was priced at ₹ 250 – 300 per kg, raisins around ₹1,000 per kg, apricot around ₹600-800 per kg, and munakka around ₹500 per kg.Taliban forces have reportedly sealed Afghanistan’s Torkham and Chaman borders with Pakistan, the only two land routes used for trade activities from India to Afghanistan and vice-versa, worrying traders across India. Traders here mostly import dry fruits, onions and apples from Afghanistan.Kanwarjit Bajaj, a Delhi-based trader and president of the Indo-Afghan Chamber of Commerce, said: “Khari Baoli market, on average, records arrival of around 35,000 tonnes of dry fruit from Afghanistan in a year. While the border in Torkham has completely been taken over and has witnessed no trade in the last one week, the one in Chaman has been operating on and off. Things have to become more stable in the days to come otherwise such supply disruptions will surely lead to price rise. India is a big market for Afghan dry fruit farmers. The Indian government should take all possible efforts to preserve the good trade relations in the country.”In a report (from Amritsar) published earlier this week, HT said the integrated check post (ICP), Attari, which facilitates India’s trade with Pakistan and Afghanistan, has been receiving goods only from Afghanistan since the Indian government abrogated Article 370 in August 2019. In 2019-20, the ICP recorded a business of ₹2,767 crore, which dipped to ₹2,500 crore in 2020-21. Prior to this, the ICP had been netting business between ₹4,000 crore and ₹5,000 crore a year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/traders-worry-as-afghan-crisis-likely-to-hit-dry-fruit-supplies-to-delhi-market-101629309879366.html
19-08-2021||Delhi||Probe into e-commerce fraud leads to 60 websites powered by SEO tools; 5 held||A day after five people were arrested from Mayapuri and Nilothi for allegedly running multiple fake e-commerce websites to dupe over 10,000 unsuspecting buyers from across the country, police said on Wednesday that the suspects used search engine optimisation (SEO) techniques -- a process to increase the traffic to their website from search engines -- to lure their victims.Police said the suspects -- mastermind Vijay Arora (37) and his aides Manmeet Singh (29), Avtar Singh (32), Raj Kumar (30) and Pradeep Kumar (32) -- were allegedly behind over 60 such fake e-commerce websites that were used to dupe victims of around ₹25 crore over the last three years.According to police, Arora, who has done a hotel management course, previously worked in a five-star hotel in Lucknow in 2014 and even launched a courier company a year later.In 2019,he began creating fake e-commerce websites offering items like clothes and electronics at throwaway prices but rarely delivered the products. He initially in Manmeet, Avtar and Rajkumar to help run the operation. He later roped in Pradeep, a recently graduated engineer from Karnataka, to help him with SEO techniques to push more traffic to his websites.Explaining the modus operandi, deputy commissioner of police (cyber cell) Anyesh Roy said, “If something costs ₹4,000 in the market and a website is offering the same item at discounts up to 60%, people will buy the item without checking the credibility of the website. Since there was no option to pay on delivery, customers paid for them online.”The DCP said less than 10% of the consumers complained on consumer forums. “Some reached out to us, after which we constituted teams to investigate. All of these complaints led to the same set of people, who were later nabbed after we received a tip-off,” said Anyesh Roy, DCP (Cyber Cell).Police said that in the last three years, they had cheated more than 10,000 customers.“When we were going through the complaints, we found many stating that they were wrongly delivered cheap goods instead of the fancy product they ordered,” said a senior police officer.Police said they also took advantage of the pandemic to dupe many people trying to buy digital devices. The official said there were several complaints of victims being promised a hig-end tab for around ₹4,000 but never getting it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-probe-into-e-commerce-fraud-leads-to-60-websites-powered-by-seo-tools-5-held-101629309879917.html
19-08-2021||Delhi||Preserve CCTV footage, order HC in murder of gangster in Tihar jail||The Delhi high court on Wednesday ordered preservation of CCTV footage while also seeking a status report from the city police and jail authorities on a plea seeking CBI probe in the alleged murder of an inmate, Ankit Gujjar, in Tihar Jail earlier this month.Gujjar (29), dubbed as one of the most wanted criminals in Uttar Pradesh with multiple counts of homicide and robbery, was found dead inside his cell in Tihar Jail on August 4.Justice Mukta Gupta issued a notice to the Delhi Police, the jail authority, the Centre and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on the petition by Gujjar’s family members and ordered preserving the CCTV footage before, after, and of the incident.The petition, filed through advocate Mehmood Pracha, has alleged that Gujjar was being harassed by the jail officials as he was “unable to meet their regularly increasing demands for money” and was murdered “as a part of pre-planned conspiracy”.It is said that Gujjar “faced much more brutality” at the hands of a jail official who “directed his subordinates to use all their might to finish him and make an example out of him for other inmates”.“The brutality meted out to the deceased as evidenced from the photographs of his corpse, coupled with the fact that he was left to die in a solitary cell without any medical attention whatsoever, renders to the present case a colour of the rarest of rare category,” said the petition.The petition further says that the jail authorities in Tihar are operating an “organised extortion syndicate” and the police was trying to manipulate the investigation in order to save and shield the culprits.The petition states that although an FIR for commission of offences of murder was registered pursuant to the directions of a magisterial court, “a free and fair investigation by a neutral investigation agency would inevitably lead to invocation of not just further provisions under the Penal Code but also under special laws such as the MCOCA (Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act), Prevention of Corruption Act and Prevention of Money Laundering Act”.The plea has also sought round the clock security for the family members. The matter will be next heard on September 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/preserve-cctv-footage-order-hc-in-murder-of-gangster-in-tihar-jail-101629309821902.html
19-08-2021||Delhi||On a break, Monsoon may return to Delhi on Thursday||Moisture-laden winds from the east will reach the Capital by late Wednesday night, ending the break monsoon phase which has seen Delhi on the boil for the last 10 days, India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said.Senior weather officials said that Delhi will receive south-easterly winds, which will increase the moisture content in the atmosphere, by early Thursday morning and also predicted patchy rain in certain parts by evening. The IMD has forecast “increased rainfall activity” from Friday.Delhi has been experiencing a break monsoon phase since August 8, with weather officials attributing the high temperatures to the hot and dry winds from Pakistan, which is rare for this time of the year.On Wednesday, the maximum temperature at the Safdarjung weather station, which provides official data for the city, was 38°C, four degrees above what is considered normal for this time of the year. The minimum temperature was 27.4°C.Met officials said that Thursday will mark the end of the break monsoon phase which, according to IMD data, is one of the longest break monsoon spells that the city has witnessed. According to weather experts, in Delhi, the break monsoon spell usually lasts for five-seven days.Unlike the excess rainfall (507.1mm) in July, August saw a slow start and recorded only 63.2mm rain till Wednesday. August is usually the rainiest month of the season in Delhi.“This is also the second break monsoon spell that Delhi is experiencing. Usually, when the break period lasts for three to four days, we do not really realise it because the period without rains is too short to see a noticeable difference in temperature,” said a senior IMD official.The IMD forecast on Wednesday said, “A low-pressure area over Odisha and adjoining areas of Jharkhand and Gangetic West Bengal has become less marked. However, the cyclonic circulation now lies over Jharkhand...and neighbouring areas... This will cause increased rainfall activity over Delhi on August 20 and 21.”Private weather forecasters also said residents will start experiencing some respite from the high temperature from Thursday. The condition will improve further on Friday. “The temperature on Thursday will be around 1-2 degrees less than Wednesday, but temperatures will start dropping significantly from Friday. On Thursday, even though there will be a slight drop in the daytime temperature, the humidity will increase discomfort,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/on-a-break-monsoon-may-return-to-delhi-on-thursday-101629309821205.html
19-08-2021||Delhi||DPCC to issue closure notices to 70 units in Patparganj Industrial Area||The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) will issue closure notices to 90 industrial units and show-cause notices to at least 70 other units operating in east Delhi’s Patparganj industrial area, based on a recently concluded survey to assess the pollution norms being flouted in the area.“An order was issued on August 14, based on which seven teams were constituted to carry out the survey. It was found that there are 819 industrial units operational in the area. Based on the findings of the teams, action will be taken in the coming weeks,” said a senior DPCC official requesting anonymity.Officials said 404 units that functioned as godowns, offices and construction units were found in the “white category” and will not attract any action. However, showcause may be issued to nearly 70 units as they were found violating the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act.The DPCC survey found that under the green category, where pollution is “mild” , 19 units were found to be operating without valid approvals, four had permission but were found to be flouting pollution control norms and two did not allow inspections in their premises.Under the more severe orange category, out of a total of 73 units, officials suggested issuing showcause notices to 18 units that were flouting air and water pollution norms, and closure notices to five industries found operating without valid permissions.Teams also suggested levying environment penalty charges on around 49 industries that were found to be contributing to air and water pollution in the area.“Regular surveys are conducted to ensure that industries follow the prescribed norms and keep a check on illegal units. Regular reports of such inspections are also shared with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to ensure strictest action,” said another official from the DPCC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dpccto-issue-closure-notices-to-70-units-in-patparganj-industrial-area-101629309819338.html
19-08-2021||Lucknow||UP supplementary budget: Yogi Adityanath govt woos youths, farmers and workers||The Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday presented a supplementary budget of ₹7301.52 crore for 2021-22, providing large or even token sums to fund schemes, including ones to make youths digitally proficient, pay increased honorarium to different categories of workers such as shiksha mitras, anganwadi workers and village chowkidars, clear dues of farmers and provide for the welfare of cows ahead of the 2022 assembly election in the state. The election is due early next year.Additional sums have been provided for some of the ongoing projects, too, in the first supplementary demands for grants for 2021-2022 that minister for finance Suresh Khanna presented in the state assembly in the presence of chief minister Yogi Adityanath.After presentation of the supplementary budget, Khanna called Yogi Adityanath “Ram of politics who is in the House to defeat the asuri shaktis or demons” when leader of opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary objected to the minister’s speech on the supplementary budget. Chaudhary, however, continued to make his point about rising inflation and other issues.Khanna also said, “The supplementary demands for ₹ 7301.52 crore are only 1.33% of the annual budget of ₹ 5.50 lakh crore. Our focus has been on providing funds for important public welfare schemes, certain ongoing projects along with other demands especially the one for ₹3,000 crore to create job opportunities for the youth (scheme to make you youth digitally proficient). Funds have been demanded for social security of advocates and construction of a memorial and cultural centre in the name of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar.” “Four-and-a-half years of this government have changed the perception of the people who feel the Yogi government has made some new records and also broken certain records,” said Khanna.

It said the demands would be funded by achieving the tax and non-tax revenue realisation targets and cutting down the unproductive expenditure.“It’s good that the state government has kept the size of the supplementary budget at a modest level. It has refrained from announcing freebies to impress the electorate, though steps have been taken to give relief to workers at the grassroots level like the Asha (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers and village chowkidars that have a direct connect with the people,” said professor Yashvir Tyagi, former head of the department of economics, Lucknow University.Funds earmarked for Ayodhya, Kashi projects, Ambedkar centreThe Uttar Pradesh government’s supplementary budget for 2021-provides ₹209.69 crore to set up public amenities and parking facilities at six places in Ayodhya, ₹ 40 crore for strengthening/broadening of the road from the Ganga river to the Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi, ₹ 50 crore for memorial and cultural centre in the name of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar and ₹90 crore for social security fund scheme for payment of ₹ 5 lakh each to advocates who have completed the 30-year membership.

19-08-2021||Pune||If situation normalises, I would like to go back again, says Pune-based Parag Rabade after his arrival from Afghanistan||Parag Rabade, who returned to Pune from Afghanistan on Wednesday, said he would like to go back to the foreign country if situation normalises in the near future. The professor, who teaches Computer Science, International Relations and Management in seven private universities in Kabul, returned to Pune in the morning a day after he arrived in India in C-17 aircraft as a part of evacuation exercise undertaken by the Indian government on Tuesday. Rabade had earlier booked a ticket to return home through an Air India flight scheduled on Monday. “My mother started crying after seeing me. My family and friends were sure that I would return home safely, but when and how it would happen was a cause of concern,” he said. Recounting the panic situation in Afghanistan after the Taliban seized control of the country, and his efforts to return home, Rabade said, “After Sunday afternoon the situation changed in Kabul. As the information got circulated that Kabul fell, there was panic among people. I had booked a ticket on the Air India flight for Monday. I reached the airport in the early hours. There was chaos at the airport and the situation was completely out of control. I went to the Indian embassy and found out that the air space had been closed. I was informed that the aircraft C-17 would be evacuating people waiting at the Indian embassy. The Taliban authorities had imposed curfew on the roads and no one could travel, but they assured to not harm the embassy.” Having left the home the day before he boarded the evacuation flight, Rabade had to wait at the airport empty stomach. He had shared the situation in a video recorded from the Indian embassy on Twitter. “My friends and family were worried about my safe return. I was in constant touch with my family and friends. There were 143 passengers in the aircraft that I boarded, including diplomats, military officials and ambassador,” said Rabade. With two doctorates, in Computer Science and Management, Rabade started teaching in universities in Kabul when he moved to the foreign country in 2014. “I am well versed in their native language so communication was not a problem. Over the years, I have developed rapport with the students. The education of my students hasn’t been completed yet. My family is worried about me, so they are saying that I shouldn’t return. Everyone is hoping for a better situation. If it improves and the embassy reopens then I would like to go back,” said Rabade. He said over the years the number of female students has increased in universities at Afghanistan and more women are getting permission to learn and take up jobs. “In 2014, the count of female students in classes was around 28%-29%. By 2020, it increased to 49%. They got permission to learn and seek employment opportunities. What will happen now is left to be seen. This period is different from the earlier times when the Taliban was in power. Now we are living in the era of the internet and smartphones. I hope there won’t be any disruptions in education. But people will have fear in their minds till situation changes for better,” said Rabade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/if-situation-normalises-i-would-like-to-go-back-again-says-pune-based-parag-rabade-after-his-arrival-from-afghanistan-101629304718877.html
19-08-2021||Pune||PMC to conduct surprise raids to contain Covid inappropriate behaviour||PUNE: With most establishments reopened, the markets are teeming with customers largely seen defying covid norms which has forced the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and district administration to carry out surprise raids in all such areas. Besides, traders who had earlier promised to follow Covid norms when urging the administration to extend operational timings are now seen flouting them in many places as markets remain open for a longer time. While regular drives on a ward-to-ward basis are already underway, the same will be intensified in the coming days in view of the crowding at marketplaces.Dr Kunal Khemnar, additional municipal commissioner, PMC, said, “There is a need to increase surprise raids in markets and I will be informing the same to all my ward officers. Things cannot be taken lightly by traders and customers who are visiting the markets. We have been warned by the district magistrate and if the number of cases increases, we will have to again impose a set of restrictions.”There were huge crowds at Raviwar peth on Wednesday as people were seen purchasing rakhis ahead of Raksha Bandhan which falls on August 22. Ganesh Chaturthi preparations have also started with several retailers buying decorations and other accessories.On his part, Mahendra Pitaliya, secretary, Federation of Trade Association of Pune, said, “We are going to distribute 40,000 “no mask, no entry” stickers among traders. They all need to take special precautions otherwise the lockdown will be back. We have also noticed a surge in the number of customers and are alerting all about following covid regulations. Regular customers should be called on an appointment basis to avoid rush while maintaining social distance.”Despite Pitaliya’s claim, only one shop out of the many at Raviwar peth was seen with the “no mask, no entry” sticker at its entrance.The owner of Babulal Gokuldas and Sons said, “All shop owners want to run their business like normal. Many a time, social distancing rules are flouted but we are trying to control such behaviour. The rush has increased in markets due to the upcoming festive season.”Meanwhile, the PMC is also keeping a close watch on pop-ups coming up on footpaths for selling wares. “We will not be allowing more structures to come up on footpaths as it makes the streets more congested,” Dr Khemnar said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-conduct-surprise-raids-to-contain-covid-inappropriate-behaviour-101629304538769.html
19-08-2021||Ranchi||Marandi’s aide booked for rape, BJP, JMM trade fire||The opposition BJP and ruling JMM in Jharkhand on Wednesday traded allegations Ranchi police booked a close aide of BJP legislature party leader Babulal Marandi for allegedly raping his domestic help at his home last year. Marandi, a former chief minister, defended his aide Sunil Tiwari, who is his political advisor, saying the case against him was political vendetta, and demanded a CBI probe.In response, JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said Marandi should stop himself from delivering verdicts even before the police complete their probe. Marandi said Tiwari has been framed as he became an intervener in a writ petition against chief minister Hemant Soren. The case is likely to come up for hearing next week.“The case against Soren started in December 2020 when a girl filed a petition in the Bombay High Court regarding her previous complaint of rape against the CM. Later, she posted a video on social media claiming she is facing life threat from me, Sunil Tiwari, Nishikant Dubey (BJP MP) and one other person from Mumbai whom I don’t know. That is when I had asked him (Sunil Tiwari) to become an intervener in that case and later also to file a writ petition in the Supreme Court, demanding a CBI probe in that case,” Marandi told reporters at a press conference here.The BJP legislator said he had also written to the Maharashtra police chief and Mumbai police commissioner to conduct a probe and provide security to the girl. “I demand an independent probe in this case, be it by CBI or by a High Court judge. We will also take up this issue with the Governor once he returns from New Delhi,” Marandi said. A case has been filed with the Argora police station in state capital Ranchi agaisnt Tiwari on a complaint of the 20-year-old girl from Khunti district, police said. The girl has accused Tiwari of rape, physical assault and life threat. He has been booked under various sections of Indian Penal Code and the SC/ST Atrocities Prevention Act, officials said. According to the first information report (FIR), the incident took place between March and September 2020 and the complaint was filed on August 16, 2021. The police, however, did not elaborate. JMM’s Bhattacharya said while rape allegations against the CM was fabricated and a defamation case has been filed with a lower court in Ranchi, Marandi was passing verdicts when police were still probing the case. “He (Marandi) is a former chief minister and has considerable influence. He should not put unnecessary pressure on police when probe is still on, especially in cases related to tribal girls who are often exploited due to their vulnerability,” said Bhattacharya. Tiwari, meanwhile, said he was being framed. “I have filed a writ petition in Supreme Court regarding the rape allegation against chief minister Hemant Soren by a Mumbai girl, seeking a CBI investigation. The case is to come up for hearing on August 23. The case against me is a result of that. I had written to the chief secretary, home secretary, Ranchi police as well as government of India on June 19 itself seeking protection. I had clearly mentioned in the letter that I was getting threats from different quarters threatening not to pursue the case,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/marandis-aide-booked-for-rape-bjp-jmm-trade-fire-101629304359349.html
19-08-2021||Delhi||Sunanda Pushkar case: Shashi Tharoor cleared of charges by Delhi court||A Delhi court on Wednesday dropped all charges against Congress lawmaker Shashi Tharoor in the case of his wife Sunanda Pushkar’s alleged suicide, seven years after she was found dead in a luxury hotel room in the Capital.Special judge Geetanjali Goel exonerated Tharoor of all charges and gave him a clean chit in the matter. A detailed order is awaited.“The accused is discharged,” the judge said in a virtual hearing.During the hearing, Tharoor thanked the judge: “Grateful Your Honour. It has been seven and a half years of absolute torture. I really appreciate it”.Later, in a statement, he said that justice has been done and it will allow everyone in the family to mourn Pushkar in peace.Also Read | ‘No issues with Sonia, Rahul; joined TMC unconditionally’“In our justice system, the process is all too often the punishment. Nevertheless, the fact that justice has been done, at last, will allow all of us in the family to mourn Sunanda in peace,” Tharoor said.He said that the order brought a significant conclusion to the “long nightmare which had enveloped me after the tragic passing of my late wife Sunanda”.“I have weathered dozens of unfounded accusations and media vilification patiently, sustained by my faith in the Indian judiciary, which today stands vindicated,” the former Union minister said.Public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava, appearing for the police, said that they were yet to get a copy of the court’s order. “We have not got the order copy and only after analysing the issues we will think of filing an appeal with the approval of the concerned department,” he told HT.Pushkar was found dead in the suite of a luxury hotel on the night of January 17, 2014, following which the police sealed the room and registered an FIR. The couple was staying at the hotel because Tharoor’s official bungalow was being renovated.The case quickly grabbed national headlines and sparked a political tussle between the then ruling Congress party and its primary challenger, the Bharatiya Janata Party, months before general elections.Delhi Police registered the first FIR on January 1, 2015 against unidentified persons. It questioned Tharoor and others, and conducted a polygraph test on six people, including the minister’s help and staff.On May 15, 2018, Delhi Police filed a 3,000-page charge sheet against Tharoor under sections 498-A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) and 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code. The maximum punishment for the offence is 10 years of imprisonment.He denied all charges, calling them “preposterous and motivated”. “I have taken note of the filing of this preposterous charge sheet & intend to contest it vigorously. No one who knew Sunanda believes she would ever have committed suicide, let alone abetment on my part... If this is conclusion arrived at after 4+ yrs of investigation it does not speak well of the methods or motivations of the Delhi Police,” he had tweeted at the time.Tharoor was granted anticipatory bail in July that year. He was never arrested in the case.During the trial, senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, appearing for Tharoor, argued that no case of abetment to suicide was made out against his client. Pahwa told the court that doctors were not able to ascertain the cause of death or establish whether Pushkar had indeed died by suicide and, hence, the prosecution case was nothing but “a figment of imagination of the police”.Pahwa had earlier said the post-mortem examination and other medical reports allegedly established that it was neither a suicide nor homicide. He also said during the course of the investigation, there were a plethora of reports by experts before the investigating officer (IO) but there was “no definite opinion on the cause of death”.Public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava had stressed that Pushkar has undergone mental cruelty which led to poor health. Shrivastava also argued that it was not an accidental death and relied on the post mortem report that suggested the cause of death was poisoning.He also said due to the alleged mental cruelty caused to Pushkar, her health worsened. The prosecutor further added that Pushkar was earlier not facing any health issue but problems began due to “stress and betrayal”.After the judgment on Wednesday, Pahwa said that the charges levelled by the police were absurd and preposterous, and that even the most essential ingredients of the offences were not present. “All the reports of various medical boards including psychological autopsy reports exonerated Dr Shashi Tharoor from the charges of homicide or suicide. The charge sheet filed was without any basis,” he said.“There was no complaint by anyone for harassment or abetment to suicide by any of the family members or friends of late Sunanda Pushkar Tharoor. I am happy that at last after seven years, justice has prevailed and he has been honourably discharged from all the charges made by Delhi Police against him,” he said.In the last seven years, three city police commissioners supervised the investigation -- BS Bassi, Alok Verma and Amulya Patnaik.The Congress welcomed the judgment.“The truth always wins. The constant abuse, innuendos and slander of our colleague Shashi Tharoor by BJP and its crony TV anchors comes to naught,” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said.Tharoor’s party colleague Jairam Ramesh also spoke out in his support. “For seven years my friend and colleague Shashi Tharoor was harassed and subjected to vilification, abuse and mental torture. Today, he stands vindicated…,” he said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sunanda-pushkar-case-shashi-tharoor-cleared-of-charges-by-delhi-court-101629267036125.html
