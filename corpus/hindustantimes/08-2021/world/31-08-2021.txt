Leading up to the earlier decided August 31-deadline by US President Joe Biden for his troops to depart Afghanistan, there were speculations and even insistence from allied forces to extend the time. However, Biden decided to stick with it and the last US military flight flew out of the war-torn nation late Monday – with videos of Taliban firing gun shots and celebrating being reported.Also Read | US troops exit: This army general is the last American soldier to leave AfghanistanIn a statement after the meeting, the EU Council said that it will “continue to coordinate with international partners, in particular with UN and its agencies, on the stabilisation of the region and to ensure that humanitarian aid reaches the vulnerable populations, in particular women and children, in Afghanistan and in neighbouring countries.”“The EU will engage and strengthen its support to third countries, in particular the neighbouring and transit countries, hosting large numbers of migrants and refugees, to reinforce their capacities to provide protection, dignified and safe reception conditions and sustainable livelihood for refugees and host communities,” the statement added.The EU’s statement also mentioned that the union and its member states will do their “utmost to ensure that the situation in Afghanistan does not lead to new security threats for EU citizens.”“All efforts must be pursued to ensure that the Taliban regime ceases all ties and practices with international terrorism and that Afghanistan does not become once again a sanctuary for terrorists and organised crime groups,” it read.This development came on the same day when Nato secretary general Jens Stolenberg reiterated his need to look after the vulnerable Afghans who wished to be evacuated from their homeland, but couldn’t be part of the military airlift.In an interview with AFP, he said that it is important for Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport to remain open in order to continue providing “humanitarian aid” to the Afghans as well as to ensure that people can be flown out. “We will not forget them,” Stolenberg added.Emphasising that the Taliban had earlier assured that people will be permitted to leave even after the withdrawal of the US troops, he said that Nato will continue to work with its allies and other countries to “help people leave,” and that Taliban will be judged not on what they say, “but by what they do.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-to-convene-forum-in-september-to-discuss-resettlement-of-at-risk-afghans-101630433068261.html
31-08-2021||World||Security, logistics, repair: What next for Kabul's airport?||With the Taliban in possession of Kabul's airport after the United States completed its withdrawal on Tuesday, the focus will now shift from the mammoth Western evacuation operation seen in the past two weeks to the group's plans for the transport hub.The symbolism of the airport was underlined Tuesday when the Taliban's top spokesman stood on its runway and declared victory over the United States. But what happens next remains unclear. Here is a look at the future of Hamid Karzai International Airport:Who is going to run security?Attacks in the past week have shown the airport is a target for terrorists, so security is the primary concern.The United States took control of the airport to manage the evacuation of tens of thousands of people with help from other countries, coming under attack from the Islamic State group's Afghanistan-Pakistan chapter.Turkey had offered to run security following the withdrawal of foreign troops, but the Taliban repeatedly said they would not accept any foreign military presence after August 31."Our fighters and special forces are capable of controlling the airport and we do not need anyone's help for the security and administrative control of the Kabul airport," Taliban spokesman Bilal Karimi told AFP on Monday.However, Michael Kugelman, a South Asia specialist at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington, said a foreign security presence would be necessary if airlines were to return, and that a deal could yet be struck."You're looking at a very volatile environment security-wise," he told AFP."There are all kinds of alarm bells that should be sounding for commercial airlines that I imagine would not be comfortable getting into the airport."Qatar's foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, told the Financial Times the Gulf state was urging the Taliban to accept foreign help."What we are trying to explain to them is that airport safety and security requires a lot more than securing the perimeters of the airport," he said.Who will operate the airport's logistics?As far as the United States is concerned, State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Friday that it was "essentially giving the airport back to the Afghan people".In recent weeks, NATO has played a key role, with civilian personnel taking care of air traffic control, fuel supplies and communications.As with security, there were discussions with Turkey over running logistics.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country was still assessing the Islamist group's offer, but with the Taliban insisting on controlling security, Erdogan appeared to drop the idea."Let's say you took over the security, but how would we explain to the world if another bloodbath takes place there?" he said.Running and maintaining an airport is complex and requires expertise. With thousands of skilled workers believed to have fled the country -- despite Taliban pleas for them to stay -- questions remain over whether there will be enough trained workers left in the Afghan capital.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said keeping the airport open was of "existential importance", adding Berlin stood ready to provide technical assistance to keep it operational.French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, speaking on France Television, said that a solution must be found, adding that "there are discussions underway today with the Qataris and the Turks".What state is the airport in?US officials have said the airport is in a bad condition, with much of its basic infrastructure degraded or destroyed.A pilot told AFP the terminal building was trashed by passengers during the chaos of the early days of the Taliban takeover.As well as the passenger halls, critical infrastructure has been destroyed, including air traffic control terminals, which will need to be replaced for commercial flights to run again.On the plus side, the two-week mass evacuation campaign has shown that the airport's runways are at least operational, if in poor condition.Will commercial flights restart?The Taliban have insisted they want to keep the civilian airport open, but without guarantees over security, commercial airlines simply won't operate out of Kabul."You're looking at a perfect storm of risks for airlines," Kugelman said.A key incentive to operate a functional airport would be the boost it would give to the Taliban's international image."If the Taliban's looking to get recognition and legitimacy from governments around the world, then it has to have a working, safe, trusted airport in place," Kugelman added.But it is likely to take time.Will people even be allowed to leave the country?The Taliban have insisted Afghans will be able to come and go.The group's deputy chief negotiator, Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, said those with passports and visas can go abroad "in a dignified manner and with peace of mind" after commercial flights open.However, many are sceptical about the Taliban's claims that they will not seek revenge against those who worked for the collapsed government or foreign forces.And Kugelman said he believed the Afghans who did not manage to be evacuated before August 31 may now be too afraid to travel to the airport."I think that for many of them who already have reason to fear the Taliban, the prospect of trying to escape the country by going to an airport controlled by the Taliban will be a very unpalatable thought."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/security-logistics-repair-what-next-for-kabul-s-airport-101630429538608.html
31-08-2021||World||‘Afghan territory not to be used to threaten or attack any country’: UNSC||The United Nations Security Council asserted on Tuesday that Afghanistan’s soil shouldn’t be used to attack any country or to shelter terrorists, even as foreign secretary Harsh Shringla highlighted the importance of combating UN-designated terror groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). In a strongly worded resolution adopted at the close of India’s presidency of the Security Council for the month of August, the UN’s highest body pointed to the Taliban’s commitments regarding combating terrorism and allowing the safe and orderly departure of Afghan and foreign nationals. The UN Security Council resolution 2593, tabled by permanent members France, the UK and the US, was backed by 13 of the 15 council members. Permanent members China and Russia abstained. The resolution demanded “that Afghan territory not be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or to finance terrorist acts”, and reiterated the “importance of combating terrorism in Afghanistan, including those individuals and entities designated pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999), and notes the Taliban’s relevant commitments”.The Security Council pointed to a Taliban statement of August 27, in which the group made a commitment that Afghans will be able to travel abroad, and leave the country at any time they want via any border crossing “with no one preventing them from travelling”, and said it expects the Taliban “will adhere to these and all other commitments, including regarding the safe, secure, and orderly departure from Afghanistan of Afghans and all foreign nationals”. Shringla, who presided over the Security Council meeting that passed the resolution, told the media that the UN and the international community had sent out a “strong signal” on its expectations regarding Afghanistan. Referring to the resolution underlining the importance of combating terrorism, he said, “In that context, I may mention that the Lashkar-e-Taiba and the Jaish-e-Mohammed are UN Security Council-proscribed terror entities that need to be called out and condemned in the strongest possible terms.” The reference to terrorist individuals and entities designated by Security Council resolution 1267 is of “direct importance to India”, he added.Shringla noted that the resolution also recognises the importance of upholding human rights, especially of Afghan women, children and minorities, an inclusive negotiated settlement and humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. “Over the last two decades, we have extended over $3 billion of assistance to Afghanistan in infrastructure development, capacity-building, education, agriculture – areas that are important for the people of Afghanistan,” he said.Shringla didn’t comment on the abstentions by China and Russia, saying only that the Security Council had been unequivocal and the resolution reflected the views of council members.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that China abstained after it failed to have a reference to the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) included in the text of the resolution. China also wasn’t keen on the resolution being passed while India held the rotating presidency of the Security Council for August, the people said.The Russian side, which has been working closely with China on Afghanistan, abstained on similar lines, the people added. The resolution was discussed by external affairs minister S Jaishankar with his US counterpart Antony Blinken and there were high-level contacts with other Security Council members. The resolution also addresses India’s key concerns pertaining to Afghanistan, such as facilitating travel from Kabul airport, the people said. Shringla noted that the resolution highlighted the importance of upholding human rights, and said, “India has always provided very strong support to minority communities in Afghanistan, in particular the Sikh and Hindu minority communities, and it is an important part of our effort to try and bring those Afghan nationals, including minorities, who want to leave Afghanistan and evacuate them.” The resolution, he added, indicated the need for a “safe zone for the passage of travellers in and out of Kabul airport” and highlighted the Security Council’s will to take necessary steps for the world community’s engagement with Afghanistan.The Security Council pointed to the “dangerous security situation” around Kabul airport and expressed concern that “intelligence indicates further terrorist attacks may take place in the area”. It sought steps for the “rapid and secure reopening of the Kabul airport and its surrounding area”. The council reaffirmed its commitment to the “sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and national unity of Afghanistan”, and called on all parties to “seek an inclusive, negotiated political settlement, with the full, equal and meaningful participation of women, that responds to the desire of Afghans to sustain and build on Afghanistan’s gains over the last twenty years”.Hours after the US completed the withdrawal of its troops from the Kabul airport and ended its 20-year presence in Afghanistan, the Taliban contended on Tuesday that the country had “gained full independence”. Despite the Taliban’s public announcements about a general amnesty, there have been numerous reports of summary executions and human rights violations from across the country. A number of terrorist leaders, including those with links to al-Qaeda, have resurfaced in Afghanistan. India’s greatest security concern is the presence in Afghanistan of up to 10,000 fighters from Pakistan-based groups such as LeT and JeM. Speaking shortly after the US withdrew all its troops from Afghanistan, Blinken said Washington will remain focused on counter-terrorism and hold the Taliban accountable to the commitment to prevent terror groups from using Afghan soil. “But while we have expectations of the Taliban, that doesn’t mean we will rely on the Taliban. We’ll remain vigilant in monitoring threats ourselves. And we’ll maintain robust counter-terrorism capabilities in the region to neutralise those threats, if necessary...,” Blinken said without offering details. Blinken also said any future engagement with a Taliban-led government in Kabul will be driven only by US national interests. “But we will not do it on the basis of trust or faith,” he said. “The Taliban seeks international legitimacy and support. Our message is: any legitimacy and any support will have to be earned.” He said a “new chapter of America’s engagement with Afghanistan has begun” with the drawdown of US forces. After ending its diplomatic presence in Kabul, the US has built a new team to lead the diplomatic mission from Doha in Qatar, which has served as the venue for negotiations with the Taliban in recent years. The US team in Doha will be led by Ian McCary, the deputy chief of mission in Afghanistan for the past year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-territory-not-to-be-used-to-threaten-or-attack-any-country-unsc-101630429738311.html

Britain’s chief of the air staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston told the English daily that the UK could also be involved in strikes against the terror outfit.“The UK stands united with our coalition partners in mourning those killed by Daesh’s (ISIS) horrific attack at Kabul airport and in our unwavering collective resolve to combat Daesh networks by all means available, wherever they operate,” Wigston was quoted as saying by the English daily.Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston further added that if the UK finds an opportunity to contribute to efforts in containing the Islamic State's Afghanistan affiliate, it is ready to do that. He also said that the rise of violent extremism is a threat to the UK and its allies. He said the UK is able to operate in Afghanistan despite it being one of the most inaccessible parts of the world.Wigston’s comments come after the Pentagon revealed that there are at least 2,000 fighters of the outfit in Afghanistan. The ISIS-K was responsible for deadly twin blasts at the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul in which 169 Afghans and 13 American soldiers were killed last week.Logistics for conducting air strikesThe report said that the UK is examining logistics for air strikes. It is checking where the Royal Air Force (RAF) jets would be based, how they would refuel and how targets would be identified on the ground. Wigston said that the UK needs to play a global role in the Global Coalition to Defeat Daesh, the US-led coalition that previously targeted ISIS in Syria and Iraq, be it by conducting air strikes or by ‘moving troops or equipment into a particular country, at scale and at speed’.‘UK has right to self-defence’UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab said that the country retains the right to exercise ‘self-defence’ in relation to ‘terrorist groups operating from abroad’. Responding to Wigston’s comments, he said he cannot go into ‘operational details’, but said that the UK needs to face the ‘new reality’ in the war-torn country. He said that nations will have to exercise a ‘moderating influence’ on the Taliban and hold it to the pledges it made.‘UK still has nationals in Afghanistan’Raab said that over 5,000 British nationals were among more than 17,000 people evacuated by the UK from Afghanistan. He highlighted that a few hundred UK nationals are still in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-ready-to-attack-isis-k-network-in-afghanistan-report-101630427383781.html

We stand united: those Afghans who have worked with us and are at risk must be given safe passage. #NATO remains committed to fighting terrorism with resolve and in solidarity. pic.twitter.com/Fyey2knj8jThe Nato chief also lauded Turkey, its member, for offering to play a role in operating the Kabul airport as the Taliban attempt to get it functional, and also thanked nearly 800 Nato civilian staff for their help in managing the airlift.“We will continue to work with Nato allies and other countries to help people leave. The Taliban has clearly stated that people will be allowed to leave, we will judge the Taliban not on what they say, but by what they do,” he pointed out.Stolenberg also stressed that allied forces would maintain diplomatic pressure on the Islamist insurgents on permitting remaining Afghan nationals who had worked for the foreign forces, and now feel at risk, to leave the country.Notably, the last US military flight flew out of the Kabul airport late on Monday ending a two-decade-long presence of Western forces in Afghanistan. According to the latest update by the White House, the US and coalition aircraft evacuated over 123,000 civilians that were all “enabled by US military service members.”“Since August 14, U.S. military aircraft evacuated more than 79,000 civilians from Kabul. This includes 5,526 Americans, and more than 73,500 third country nationals and Afghan civilians. This last category includes SIVs (Special Immigrant Visas), consular staff, at-risk Afghans and their families,” another tweet by the White House on Tuesday morning read.Since August 14, U.S. military aircraft evacuated more than 79,000 civilians from Kabul.

Qureshi also said that it is a pivotal moment in Afghanistan’s history.Qureshi’s comments came amid the visit by German foreign minister Heiko Maas to Islamabad where both the ministers are scheduled to discuss bilateral issues and regional situations. “The international community must remain engaged. Humanitarian assistance must flow. Do not let the economic collapse in Afghanistan take place,” Qureshi said.He also urged the international community to remain vigilant about the role of spoilers in Afghanistan. He said it is necessary for the international community to ‘discern between those standing for peace and the spoilers.’The German foreign minister, however, said that if the Taliban made commitments to form an inclusive government it remains to be seen if they keep the promises. “It is important for us that all Afghans, even those who do not support the Taliban, feel represented by this government and it remains to be seen whether the Taliban take this into account,” Maas said.Qureshi said that the Taliban’s recent statements on respect for human rights and international norms were encouraging.Restarting charter flightsMaas also said that Germany was preparing in close coordination with other nations to organise charter flights in order to take eligible Afghans to Germany once the Hamid Karzai International Airport becomes functional again.Qureshi and Maas also spoke about developing bilateral cooperation in diverse fields and regional peace and security, with focus on Afghanistan. Qureshi also said that since Germany is Pakistan’s one of the largest trading partners in the European Union, there were possibilities that trade could be enhanced by developing economic linkages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/abandoning-afghanistan-could-lead-to-serious-consequences-pak-foreign-minister-101630423743180.html

Ahmad clarified that their stay is for a ‘limited period’ and the American soldiers in Pakistan have been issued transit visas ranging from three weeks to one month, news agency PTI reported quoting Pakistan’s Dawn.Ahmad’s response comes after videos and pictures of the US troops surfaced on social media, sparking speculations that there would be a long-term presence of the American military on Pakistan’s soil. Earlier, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam’s chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman claimed that Pakistan was booking hotels for Americans in Islamabad and said that it was returning to Musharraf-era. This speculation was dismissed by Ahmad.‘Pak played huge role in peace process’The interior minister also said Pakistan played a huge role in the peace process in Afghanistan and will continue to fulfil its duty of national security and its international expectations. “No other country has rendered sacrifices for peace in Afghanistan more than Pakistan. Peace and stability in Afghanistan were linked with peace and stability in Pakistan,” Ahmad said. He also said that he received assurance from the Taliban that the banned outfit Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) will not use Afghan soil to foment terror activities against the nationHe also said that all Pakistanis were evacuated from Afghanistan except for 30-to-40 of its nationals as their families remain there.‘Feared huge migrant influx’The interior minister said that following the blasts at Kabul airport, Pakistan expected a huge influx of migrants but expressed relief that such an event has not occurred. He also highlighted that 2,192 people entered Pakistan through the Torkham border while 1,627 people reached Islamabad on flights. He also said that a small number of people arrived via the Chaman border.Ahmad also said that issuance of visas to those coming from Afghanistan was not a money-making exercise and normal visa fee was being charged from the people and visas on arrival were issued free of cost.

One such was the former player in Afghanistan women’s national football team, Fanoos Basir, who escaped her homeland as she saw no future for herself under the Islamist insurgent group Taliban’s rule.Now, sitting at a reception centre for refugees in France, Basir reminisces of her life back home and the “nightmare” the citizens had of Taliban recapturing Afghanistan. “We had a lot of dreams for our country, for our future, for the future of women in Afghanistan,” she told Reuters after being flown out of Kabul on a French evacuation flight.Soon after joining a novice Afghan national football team in 2010, Basir commenced to take part in international tournaments overseas – pictures often showed her head uncovered, and smiling with her arms around her teammates. This scenario couldn’t go more against what the Taliban is notoriously known for as in the 90s when they were in power: they had ordered women to stay indoors, barred them from receiving education or work, taking part in sports or even leaving the house without a male chaperon. “There is no future for women… for now,” Basir told Reuters.Following the sweeping triumph of the insurgents after they regained control over Kabul on August 15, and the former President of Afghanistan Ashraf Ghani and nearly all of his aides fleeing the country, Afghans have been desperately trying to escape. The Afghan national football team has been shut down, and a vast majority of the contingent has been evacuated via an Australian military aircraft.Watch | 'Saw Taliban around my home': How Afghan women's basketball star escapedEarlier, Khalida Popal, the former Afghan women’s football team captain had urged her teammates to burn their kits, delete any trace of their social media accounts, and erase their public identities for the sake of their safety. In a video interview, Popal, now based in Copenhagen, said that during their two-decades-long reign, the Taliban had killed, raped and stoned women to death and female footballers were scared what their future may be like. “[It’s] painful for me, for someone as an activist who stood up and did everything possible to achieve and earn that identity as a women's national team player,” the co-founder of the Afghan women's football league added to Reuters.Also Read | Afghan women set afire for 'bad cooking', used as sex slaves by Taliban: LawyerAlthough Basir had left playing the sport many years before, she has since run a club side for women – and even worked as a civil engineer. The 25-year-old told Reuters that after the militant group took over Kabul, she refrained from leaving her house for days – wearing a burqa when she did finally decide to venture out.With no possibility of a woman’s sport team in Afghanistan at the moment, Basir said that she had to quit her job as an engineer as well. Addressing various reports regarding the insurgents imposing their old diktats on women not leaving the house without a male relative, she said that it would have meant bringing her father or brother to work every day.As glimpses of the old life under Taliban began coming back, Basir decided to leave Afghanistan with her frail parents.Evacuation battleIt is no novelty that the scenes outside Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport – both before and after the deadly suicide attacks by the ISIS-K, were dangerous. Basir failed to get through the enormous queue and crowds of people outside the airport for three days in a row. In her interview with Reuters, she even described seeing Taliban fighters firing guns and beating people with sticks.When she got a chance to speak with one of the militant group’s representatives, she was told, “You are a woman, we do not want to talk with you.”The former Afghan women's team footballer had given up hope to escape the Taliban regime, and that’s when she and her family heard the French embassy had organised buses to pick up eligible people for evacuation. Basir and her parents were able to reach the Kabul airport, and eventually fly out.Future plansBasir and her parents are undergoing Covid-19 quarantine at the reception centre for refugees – about 450km west of Paris. She told Reuters that she hopes to eventually work as a civil engineer in her new home, although she said that leaving Afghanistan, “[their] dreams. Everything is so hard for everyone.” “Now, we will start from zero,” she was quoted as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-future-for-women-under-taliban-former-afghan-football-player-after-fleeing-101630411277865.html
31-08-2021||World||Japan ministry seeks 2.6% defense hike amid China worries||Japan’s Defense Ministry on Tuesday asked for a 2.6% increase over this year’s record budget as it seeks to further strengthen the country's military in the face of China’s growing assertiveness in the region.The ministry's budget sought 5.48 trillion yen ($49.86 billion) for the year starting April 1, 2022, in what could be a record high if approved by the Finance Ministry and parliament later this year, after a nine-year consecutive increase.Japan’s concerns about China’s increasingly assertive military actions in the region, as well as Beijing’s growing tension with Taiwan and rivalry with the United States, were specifically noted in this year’s defense report adopted in July.The report said China's increased military capability and the lack of clarity regarding Chinese military spending is “a matter of grave concern" and criticized China’s maritime activity in and around Japanese-claimed waters.Japan has been stepping up defense in the country’s southwestern regions and islands, including Ishigaki Island, where a new military base with a land-to-sea missile defense system will be opened. Ishigaki is north of the uninhabited but Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, which are also claimed by China and called Diaoyu.Japan's military spending and capabilities have grown continuously since former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took office in December 2012, rising by 17% over the past nine years. Abe's government allowed Japan's self-defense force to play a greater international role by adopting a new interpretation in 2015 of the war-renouncing Article 9 of the constitution.Critics say Japan, as the world’s fastest-aging country with a shrinking population, should allocate more money toward health care and other purposes instead of defense spending.Costly items in the latest budget request included 130 billion yen ($1.18 billion) to acquire a dozen more U.S.-made F-35 stealth fighters from Lockheed Martin, including four F-35Bs capable of short takeoff and vertical landings that can operate on two Japanese helicopter carriers that are being converted.The Defense Ministry also seeks to increase research and development spending to a record 325.7 billion yen ($2.96 billion) for “game-changing” technologies such as unmanned aircraft operated by artificial intelligence.The ministry is seeking nearly 105 billion yen ($1 billion) for home-developed fighter jets — the first in about 30 years since the Mitsubishi F-2 — by around 2035, a multibillion-dollar project led by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.In order to beef up its space forces, Japan wants 84 billion yen ($765 million) that includes purchasing lasers and satellites to track targets in space, as well as increasing space force personnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-ministry-seeks-2-6-defense-hike-amid-china-worries-101630412191426.html

31-08-2021||World||EU ministers meet to discuss Afghanistan's fall to Taliban, influx of refugees||European Union justice and home affairs ministers are meeting Tuesday to discuss the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan and the flow of refugees and migrants it is expected to produce.The meeting comes the day after the last US forces flew out of Kabul's international airport, ending America's longest war.The 27-nation bloc is looking for ways to prevent a repeat of a 2015 refugee crisis fueled by Syria's civil war. The arrival in Europe of well over a million migrants that year led to infighting among EU member nations over how best to manage the influx. A new wave of migrants from Afghanistan is likely to exacerbate tensions.The EU is likely to provide funding to house refugees in countries bordering Afghanistan to prevent them heading for Europe.“It’s important that we are in a position where we can avoid a humanitarian crisis, migratory crisis and a security threat from Afghanistan," European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson said before the ministers' meeting.“But then we need to act now and not wait until we have big flows of people at our external borders or until we have terrorist organisations being stronger,” she added. "So that’s why we need to act now to support people in Afghanistan, in the neighboring countries, and work together with international organisations.”The EU's focus on accommodating migrants close to Afghanistan will not please rights groups.Also Read | Don't want Afghan militants arriving under cover of refugees: PutinAmnesty International said in a letter to Johansson that the EU and its member nations “must refrain from extremely damaging responses that put emphasis on keeping the EU’s border ‘protected’ and proposing or adopting measures that shift the responsibility for the protection of refugees to third countries.”The human rights group said the EU should give Afghans who reach Europe “access to the territory and to fair and effective asylum procedures and adequate reception conditions” and also consider all Afghan women and girls as “prima facie refugees” due to the risks they would face in Afghanistan.American forces helped evacuate over 120,000 U.S. citizens, foreigners and Afghans after the Taliban regained control of the country, according to the White House. Coalition forces also evacuated their citizens and Afghans. But foreign nations and the U.S. government acknowledged they didn’t evacuate all who wanted to go.According to some EU estimates, around 570,000 Afghans have applied for asylum in Europe since 2015.Asylum applications by Afghan nationals have climbed by a third since February as it became clear that the United States would pull troops out of Afghanistan. More than 4,648 applications were recorded in May, according to the EU’s asylum office. About half of the applications tend to be successful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-ministers-meet-to-discuss-afghanistan-s-fall-to-taliban-influx-of-refugees-101630409018599.html

The director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a report that indications of the operation of the radiochemical laboratory at the Yongbyon Site from mid-February to early July 2021 are consistent with previous reprocessing campaigns of irradiated fuel discharged from the 5-megawatt reactor at the same site.“The DPRK’s nuclear activities continue to be a cause for serious concern. Furthermore, the new indications of the operation of the 5MW(e) reactor and the Radiochemical Laboratory are deeply troubling,” the report noted.The UN Security Council has passed multiple resolutions to impose a wide range of sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear activities but the secretive regime continues to violate international regulatory norms. The United States and several other countries have imposed separate sanctions but that hasn’t deterred North Korea from nuclear tests and missile programmes. The 5-megawatt reactor is widely believed to have produced plutonium for nuclear weapons and is at the heart of North Korea's nuclear programme, reported news agency ANI.“The continuation of the DPRK’s nuclear programme is a clear violation of relevant UN Security Council resolutions and is deeply regrettable,” the IAEA director-general said.The IAEA called upon Pyongyang to comply fully with its obligations under relevant Security Council resolutions and cooperate promptly with the atomic agency in the full and effective implementation of its NPT Safeguards Agreement.On Monday, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was aware of the reports from North Korea "and concerned by the latest developments.""He calls for the DPRK to refrain from any nuclear weapons-related activities and to resume talks with the other parties concerned,” Dujarric said. "Diplomatic engagement remains the only pathway to sustainable peace and complete and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deeply-troubling-un-atomic-agency-raises-concern-over-north-korea-nuclear-activities-101630403828799.html

The vaccines by both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna use the mRNA technology and are currently being widely used in inoculations by several countries.Almost 1,650 healthcare workers from a hospital in Belgium, including men, women, those previously infected with Covid-19 and those uninfected, across age groups, were involved in the study. As many as 688 people received the Moderna vaccine and 959 people were immunised with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.Also read | Two die in Japan after getting Moderna vaccine jabs suspended over contaminationThe findings of the study were published in a letter to the Journal of the American Medical Association on August 30. The study showed that among people previously uninfected, those who were inoculated with the Moderna vaccine had an antibody response of 2,881 units/ml while those administered with the Pfizer vaccine had 1,108 units/ml. Similarly, among those previously infected too, those with the Moderna vaccine showed higher antibody presence than those who received the Pfizer vaccine.The study also show that previously infected participants had higher counts of antibodies than those who were not infected, after receiving both doses of the vaccine. Both the vaccines have demonstrated an efficacy rate of more than 90% in preventing Covid-19 illness.Earlier on August 27, another separate study by the Northwestern University in the US showed that the antibody response in adults with prior history of Covid-19 infection reduced by 20%, two months after receiving the second Moderna or Pfizer vaccine dose. The university said in a press statement that the study “underscores the importance of receiving a second dose of vaccine, not only because it is commonly known that immunity from vaccines wanes over time, but also because of the risk posed by emerging variants, including the highly contagious delta variant.” The study said that prior exposure to Covid-19 does not guarantee a higher level of antibodies or a robust antibody response to the first dose of the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-produces-more-antibodies-than-pfizer-shot-study-101630404239662.html

It was in line with the UAE’s desire to “build bridges, maximize common goals and work together with friends” to ensure stability and regional prosperity, he wrote.  The call comes after a surprise meeting between Erdogan and the UAE’s national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan earlier this month that discussed boosting investments and seemed to cap years of hostile rhetoric between the two countries which have been locked in proxy conflicts from Libya to Syria for nearly a decade. UAE officials have spoken about the need to shore up Middle East ties as Washington draws back from the region and seeks to revive nuclear diplomacy with Iran. At home Erdogan’s poll ratings have hit an all-time low this year amid disenchantment with the Turkish government’s handling of the economy. At the same time the UAE started to hold out the promise of better ties that could benefit trade. Sheikh Tahnoun is the chairman of International Holding Co., which is one of the UAE’s most valuable listed firms. The company is weighing investment opportunities in Turkey, Reuters reported last week. Tahnoun, who is the brother of Abu Dhabi’s crown prince, also chairs Abu Dhabi’s newest sovereign fund, ADQ, which has amassed an estimated $110 billion in assets since being founded in 2018. It recently joined a funding round for Turkish e-commerce company Trendyol. Read More: Gulf Reaches Out to Erdogan in Wary Move to Ease TensionsSo far, though, investments have been largely tentative due to longstanding tensions stemming from Turkey’s support for the Muslim Brotherhood -- an Islamist political organization viewed as a threat by the UAE’s rulers. Turkey and the UAE have been on opposing sides of a proxy war in Libya and have disagreed on issues ranging from Syria to Iraq and the eastern Mediterranean. The UAE has also moved to mend ties with Qatar, which has counted on the support from Turkey during a near three-year feud with the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uaes-crown-prince-nahyan-turkey-s-erdogan-hold-friendly-call-101630400333052.html

Their stay in the country, Ahmed said, “is only for a limited period.”“Foreigners are coming to Pakistan after evacuation from Afghanistan, and their stay here would be only for a limited period. They have been issued transit visas ranging from 21 to 30 days,” he told Dawn. Ahmed's response came after pictures emerged on social media showing American forces at the Islamabad airport, triggering speculations of a possible long-term presence of the Americans in Pakistan.On the number of arrivals in Islamabad from Afghanistan, the minister said as many as 1627 people entered Pakistan’s capital city on flights. 2192 individuals, he said, arrived in his country from the Torkham border crossing, while a “small number of people” came here from the busier Chaman border. He described as a “normal activity” Afghans arriving in Pakistan from the Chaman border and returning to their homeland using the same route.“None of those who arrived via the two borders have been granted refugee status,” he further said, adding that issuing visas to those arriving from Afghanistan is not being misused as a “money-making activity.” Ahmed said, “Normal visa fee is being charged from them. Also, visas on arrival being provided free of coast.”When it comes to the Taliban, several Pakistani personalities have made remarks that are seen to be in favour of the regime. On August 16, prime minister Imran Khan described the group’s takeover of Afghanistan as Afghans “breaking the chains of slavery.” On Monday, Shahid Afridi, who, like Khan, is a former cricketer, said, “They (Taliban) have come with a very positive mind and are allowing women to work. And I believe they like cricket very much.”The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan for a second time by capturing Kabul on August 15 as the US troops prepared to leave the country after 20 years.

PM Trudeau himself had called the September 20 snap polls on August 15, seeking to turn the Liberal Party’s minority government in Ottawa to a majority one. But the incumbent prime minister now faces a rising challenge from rival PM hopeful Erin O’Toole of the Conservatives, according to recent pre-poll surveys.“An election campaign many had thought would be fought and won or lost on the basis of Canada’s post-pandemic future is instead being overshadowed in its first weeks by the future of Afghanistan and the evacuation of those desperate to leave the embattled nation,” polling agency ARI said in a release. Almost 60% of respondents said their voting preference has not been affected by the situation in Afghanistan, but 20% are taking it into consideration. In a close election, that could matter, ARI noted, saying, “Those who say these events will affect their choice are unfavourable to the Liberal Party.” Just 2% consider the Canadian airlift ops a success, 41% consider it to have gone alright and 37%, deem it a failure. “The timing of the crisis - running in parallel with the 44th federal election - creates an obvious political dimension for parties and leadership,” ARI commented.Canada had wrapped up its evacuation efforts in Afghanistan last week. But last Sunday, foreign minister Marc Garneau had described the criticism of Ottawa’s mission as “fair enough” during an interview with the outlet CTV News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadas-role-in-afghan-turmoil-may-dent-trudeau-s-chances-in-election-survey-101630395406526.html

Why should I be?” Masooda, a class 5 student of a private school in Kabul, told the Associated Press.The Taliban have said students will be segregated by sex, which has anyway been a practice in many schools for older students across Afghanistan. On Sunday, the Taliban's acting higher education minister said Afghan women will be allowed to study at university but there would be a ban on mixed classes under their rule."The... people of Afghanistan will continue their higher education in the light of Sharia law in safety without being in a mixed male and female environment," Abdul Baqi Haqqani, the Taliban's acting minister for higher education, said.

Anyone who digressed was handed down brutal punishments-- from public beatings to stoning to death for adultery.Taliban fighters took control of the Kabul airport, which witnessed scenes of chaos, desperation and a suicide bombing, on Tuesday following the withdrawal of the last US troops, ending 20 years of war, and several reports said there was celebratory gunfire across the Afghan capital.

31-08-2021||World||Afghan soil shouldn’t be used to shelter terrorists, says UNSC resolution||The United Nations Security Council has demanded that Afghan soil shouldn’t be used to attack any country or to shelter terrorists even as American forces completed their drawdown in Afghanistan a fortnight after the Taliban takeover. In a resolution adopted at the end of India’s presidency of the Security Council for the month of August, the UN’s highest body reiterated the importance of combating terror in Afghanistan, including individuals and entities sanctioned under UN Resolution 1267 and pointed to the Taliban’s commitments in this regard. Hours after the US completed the withdrawal of its troops from the Kabul airport and ended its 20-year presence in Afghanistan, the Taliban contended the country had “gained full independence”. Despite the Taliban’s public announcements about a general amnesty, there have been numerous reports of summary executions and human rights violations from across the country. A number of terrorist leaders, including those with links to al-Qaeda, have resurfaced in Afghanistan. India’s greatest security concern is the presence in Afghanistan of up to 10,000 fighters from Pakistan-based groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. The UN Security Council resolution demanded “that Afghan territory not be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or to finance terrorist acts, and reiterates the importance of combating terrorism in Afghanistan, including those individuals and entities designated pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999), and notes the Taliban’s relevant commitments”. Also Read | Last serving US soldier leaves Afghanistan: Who is Major General Chris Donahue?Speaking shortly after the US completed the withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan, secretary of state Antony Blinken said Washington will remain focused on counter-terrorism. “The Taliban has made a commitment to prevent terrorist groups from using Afghanistan as a base for external operations that could threaten the US or our allies, including al-Qaeda and the Taliban’s sworn enemy, ISIS-K...We will hold them accountable to that commitment,” he said. “But while we have expectations of the Taliban, that doesn’t mean we will rely on the Taliban. We’ll remain vigilant in monitoring threats ourselves. And we’ll maintain robust counter-terrorism capabilities in the region to neutralise those threats, if necessary...,” Blinken said without offering details. Blinken said the US had engaged with the Taliban over the past few weeks to enable evacuation operations, and any future engagement with a Taliban-led government in Kabul will be “driven by one thing only: our vital national interests”. The US will work with a new Afghan government to ensure greater stability in the country and region and protect the gains of the past two decades. “But we will not do it on the basis of trust or faith,” Blinken said. “The Taliban seeks international legitimacy and support. Our message is: any legitimacy and any support will have to be earned.” The Security Council also pointed to a Taliban statement of August 27 in which the group made a commitment that Afghans will be able to travel abroad, leave the country at any time they want to via any border crossing “with no one preventing them from travelling”, and said it expects the Taliban “will adhere to these and all other commitments, including regarding the safe, secure, and orderly departure from Afghanistan of Afghans and all foreign nationals”. Also Read | Biden to explain why deadline of US pullout from Afghanistan was not extendedThe council noted the “dangerous security situation” around the Kabul airport and expressed concern that “intelligence indicates further terrorist attacks may take place in the area”. It called on relevant parties to work with global partners to strengthen security and prevent further casualties. It also requested that steps should be taken for the “rapid and secure reopening of the Kabul airport and its surrounding area” – a significant demand since nationals of several countries, including India and the US, are still believed to be in Kabul. The UN Security Council reaffirmed its commitment to the “sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and national unity of Afghanistan”, and condemned the “deplorable attacks” near Kabul airport on August 26 that were claimed by the Islamic State-Khorasan and resulted in deaths and injuries of more than 300 civilians and 28 military personnel. The council also highlighted the importance of upholding human rights, including those of women, children and minorities, and called on all parties in Afghanistan to “seek an inclusive, negotiated political settlement, with the full, equal and meaningful participation of women, that responds to the desire of Afghans to sustain and build on Afghanistan’s gains over the last twenty years”. Blinken said a “new chapter of America’s engagement with Afghanistan has begun” with the drawdown of US forces. He added, “It’s one in which we will lead with our diplomacy. The military mission is over. A new diplomatic mission has begun.” After ending its diplomatic presence in Kabul, the US has built a new team to lead the diplomatic mission from Doha in Qatar, which has served as the venue for negotiations between the US and the Taliban in recent years. The US team in Doha will be led by Ian McCary, the deputy chief of mission in Afghanistan for the past year. “For the time being, we will use this post in Doha to manage our diplomacy with Afghanistan, including consular affairs, administering humanitarian assistance, and working with allies, partners and regional and international stakeholders to coordinate our engagement and messaging to the Taliban,” Blinken said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-soil-shouldn-t-be-used-to-shelter-terrorists-says-unscresolution-101630391745963.html
31-08-2021||World||Over and out: US completes withdrawal from Afghanistan||The United States on Monday announced the end of its military mission in Afghanistan, bringing to an end a 20-year presence that had started with the invasion of the country following the September 11, 2001 terror attacks in America.The US has now left Afghan soil completely, barring an estimated 100-200 Americans still trying to leave the country. The American embassy in Kabul had been shut down some days ago and its diplomats had been operating from the airport in the Afghan capital before being flown out. The US mission will now conduct diplomacy with the Taliban administration and consular operations out of Doha, Qatar.The last American military plane left Kabul on Monday night at 11.59pm, local time. “Our 20-year military presence in Afghanistan has ended,” US President Joe Biden said in a statement shortly after, thanking military personnel for completing the “execution of the dangerous retrograde from Afghanistan as scheduled”. He will speak more broadly in an address to the nation on Tuesday.Until then, the US president said in defence of his decision to end the mission on schedule that it was “the unanimous recommendation” of the military leadership on the ground to end the airlift operations. “Their view was that ending our military mission was the best way to protect the lives of our troops, and secure the prospects of civilian departures for those who want to leave Afghanistan in the weeks and months ahead,” he said.Biden is facing unrelenting criticism in the US on two fronts - for leaving Afghanistan that paved the way for the return of the Taliban obliterating the progress made in the past 20 years, and for the chaotic evacuation operations that played out in full view of the world, involving a deadly terror attack carried out by Islamic State at the Kabul airport that claimed close to 200 lives.Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid welcomed the completion of the US pull-out on Monday evening, tweeting, “The last American occupier withdrew from (Kabul Airport) at 12 o’clock, and our country gained its full independence.”There was no further comment from the Taliban on the future of its ties with the US.“The military mission is over, a new diplomatic mission has begun,” US secretary of state Antony Blinken said in a speech, seen as the Biden administration’s first high-level response to the development. Blinken has rolled out a seven-point plan for America’s relationship with Afghanistan that revolves around the Taliban government’s ability to deliver on an entire range of assurances; such as not allowing Afghanistan to be used by terrorists to attack the US or its allies, allowing women and girls to study and work; and letting Afghans leave the country if they have the paperwork.A key part of this plan is the new US mission in Doha. “As of today, we suspended our diplomatic presence in Kabul and transferred our operations to Doha, Qatar, which will soon be formally notified to Congress,” Blinken said. “Given the uncertain security environment and political situation in Afghanistan, it was the prudent step to take.”Combating terrorism will be an important component of the relationship. “We will stay focused on counterterrorism,” Blinken said. “The Taliban has made a commitment to prevent terrorist groups from using Afghanistan as a base for external operations that could threaten the United States, our allies, including Al-Qaeda, and the Taliban’s sworn enemy, ISIS-K. We will hold them accountable to that commitment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-and-out-us-completes-withdrawal-from-afghanistan-101630389045872.html

US forces ended their two decade long mission in Afghanistan on Monday.In an open letter, these retired flag officers claim that both Austin and Milley "should have recommended against this dangerous withdrawal in the strongest possible terms". The two officers should resign as a matter of conscience and public statement, the retired general said in the letter.The ending of US mission coincided with a chaotic and bloody evacuation that left stranded hundreds of American citizens and thousands of Afghans who had aided the American war effort."The retired Flag Officers signing this letter are calling for the resignation and retirement of the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) based on negligence in performing their duties primarily involving events surrounding the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan," said the letter signed by 87 retired servicemen. It was released on Monday.Austin, meanwhile, posted a series of tweets on Tuesday morning about the completion of US evacuation process. "Today, we completed the U.S. military evacuation of civilians and the removal of all forces from Afghanistan. I'm deeply saddened that in the course of this historic evacuation we lost 13 of our own, along with so many others who were killed and wounded by cruel terrorists," he said on Twitter.Today, we completed the U.S. military evacuation of civilians and the removal of all forces from Afghanistan.

The group that regained control over the country, a fortnight ago, also said that they "want good diplomatic relations with the US.""This victory belongs to us all," Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said during the celebration, according to an AFP report. "The world should have learned their lesson and this is the enjoyable moment of victory," Mujahid also said from the runway.Until now, the airport was in control of the US forces. The two-decades-old war in Afghanistan came to an end on Monday eve as the plane carrying the remaining American troops left the country. "Every single US service member is out of Afghanistan, I can say that with absolute certainty," General Kenneth F McKenzie, head of the US Central Command, said.The US-supported Afghan government collapsed on August 15 after the Taliban seized control of the capital city of Kabul. The military takeover led to chaotic scenes at the very same Hamid Karzai International airport after thousands of Afghans made a desperate attempt to flee the brutal regime of Sunni fundamentalists. Last week, an Islamic State suicide attack at an airport gate killed at least 169 Afghans and 13 US service members.With Taliban's return to power, panic has gripped country as many afghan fear a repeat of Taliban's initial rule from 1996-2001, which was infamous for their treatment of girls and women, as well as a brutal justice system.However, since their takeover, the group has repeatedly promised a more tolerant and moderate rule compared with their first stint in power.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-walk-across-kabul-airport-runway-say-want-good-diplomatic-ties-with-us-101630385530472.html

The insurgents are not only conducting door-to-door searches, looking for people who helped American and allied forces, they are also pinning letters on their houses warning them to "surrender or die".Also Read: Afghans in Belgium organise protest, slam Pakistan for supporting TalibanAccording to Daily Mail, the letters pinned to the doors ask people to attend a Taliban-convened court where their punishment will be announced. The letters warn that failure to attend the court will result in death penalty, the Daily Mail reported.It spoke to a number of such people who have received these letters. One of them, whose construction company helped the UK military build roads in Helmand province, said he is hiding because he doesn't want to die. The 34-year-old also said that the letter pinned at his door was stamped by the Taliban.Another person the Daily Mail spoke to worked as a translator for the British military. He said the letter has branded him as "spy of the infidel" along with a warning to give himself up or pay with his life.Another translator found the letter in his shoe after he came back from prayers at a mosque.These men said they wanted to get out of Afghanistan and had even gone to Kabul airport, but couldn't board an evacuation flight due to the rush of the people. They told Daily Mail that they are now trapped and fear for the lives of their families.Also Read: Biden to explain why US deadline was not extendedThe Taliban used this tactic of issuing threats using the letters in villages when they were in power in Afghanistan more than 20 years ago. But this time, they are now being widely circulated in cities.This shows that the governing style of the insurgent group has hardly changed form its last rule, despite Taliban leaders portraying the group as moderate.Meanwhile, celebratory gunfire echoed across Kabul as Taliban fighters took control of the airport before dawn on Tuesday following the withdrawal of the last US troops, ending 20 years of war that left the Islamic militia stronger than it was in 2001.America's longest war took the lives of nearly 2,500 US troops and an estimated 240,000 Afghans, and cost some $2 trillion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-pin-letters-with-chilling-surrender-or-die-message-in-cities-report-101630383557833.html

Over the next years, the American forces remained in the country and took on nation-building tasks by providing financial aid, training Afghan forces against the insurgents.However, Afghanistan returned to Taliban rule on August 15 even as foreign forces started withdrawing from the country as per the peace deal agreed between the US and the hardline Islamist group.

Any U.S. civil aircraft operator that wants to fly into/out of or over Afghanistan must receive prior authorization from the FAA."On August 18, the FAA said U.S. air carriers and civilian pilots could fly into Kabul to conduct evacuation or relief flights with prior US Defense Department approval.

The wind seems worse this time but the damage seems less bad," said French Quarter resident Dereck Terry, surveying his neighborhood in flip flops and a t-shirt, umbrella in hand."I have a broken window. Some tiles from the roof are on the streets and water came inside," the 53-year-old retired pharmacist added.According to Edwards the levee system in the affected parishes had "really held up very well, otherwise we would be facing much more problems today."- 'Total devastation' -In the town of Jean Lafitte, just south of New Orleans, mayor Tim Kerner said the rapidly rising waters had overtopped the 7.5-foot-high (2.3-meter) levees."Total devastation, catastrophic, our town levees have been overtopped," Kerner told ABC-affiliate WGNO."We have anywhere between 75 to 200 people stranded in Barataria," after a barge took out a bridge to the island.Cynthia Lee Sheng, president of Jefferson Parish covering part of the Greater New Orleans area, said people sheltered in their attics.Several residents of LaPlace, just upstream from New Orleans, posted appeals for help on social media, saying they were trapped by rising flood waters."The damage is really catastrophic," Edwards told Today, adding that Ida had "delivered the surge that was forecasted. The wind that was forecasted and the rain."President Joe Biden declared a major disaster for Louisiana and Mississippi, which gives the states access to federal aid.One person was killed by a falling tree in Prairieville, 60 miles northwest of New Orleans, the Ascension Parish Sheriff's Office said.A second victim died while trying to drive through floodwaters in New Orleans, the Louisiana Department of Health tweeted.Edwards reported on Twitter that Louisiana had deployed more than 1,600 personnel to conduct search and rescue across the state.US Army Major General Hank Taylor told journalists at a Pentagon briefing that military, federal emergency management officials and the National Guard had activated more than 5,200 personnel in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and Alabama.- 'Way less debris' -Most residents had heeded warnings of catastrophic damage and authorities' instructions to flee."I stayed for Katrina and from what I've seen so far there is way less debris in the streets than after Katrina," Mike, who has lived in the French Quarter, told AFP Monday, declining to give his last name.The memory of Katrina, which made landfall on August 29, 2005, is still fresh in the state, where it caused some 1,800 deaths and billions of dollars in damage.The National Hurricane Center issued warnings of storm surges and flash floods over portions of southeastern Louisiana, southern Mississippi and southern Alabama as Ida travels northeast.As of 2100 GMT Monday, Ida was located about 20 miles northwest of Jackson, Mississippi, with maximum sustained winds of 20 miles per hour.The storm system is expected to track across the United States all the way to the mid-Atlantic through Wednesday, creating the potential for flash flooding along the way.Scientists have warned of a rise in cyclone activity as the ocean surface warms due to climate change, posing an increasing threat to the world's coastal communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-ida-inflicts-catastrophic-destruction-on-louisiana-101630374637926.html

Retaliatory and pre-emptive strikes by the United States on IS positions over the past few days seem to have angered the terrorists.The Pentagon said it carried out a drone strike on Sunday against a vehicle threatening Kabul airport that had been linked to IS.“There is no permission for them to do such operations... our independence must be respected,” the Taliban spokesperson said.Islamic State has been highly critical of the troop withdrawal deal struck between the Taliban and Washington last year, which saw the Taliban offer security guarantees.One IS commentary published after the fall of Kabul accused the Taliban of betraying jihadists with the US withdrawal deal and vowed to continue its fight, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors militant communications.During the Taliban’s prison break spree this summer to free its fighters, many battle-hardened IS militants were also released - increasingly looking like a lethal error.Although both groups are hardline Sunni Islamist militants, they have differed on the minutiae of religion and strategy, while each claiming to be the true flag-bearers of jihad.In recent years, the IS Afghanistan-Pakistan chapter has been responsible for some of the attacks in those countries.Global coalition’s vowA group of countries that have banded together to fight Islamic State, including the US, released a statement pledging to work to eliminate the group. “We will draw on all elements of national power - military, intelligence, diplomatic, economic, law enforcement - to ensure the defeat of this brutal terrorist organisation,” the coalition said in a statement released by the US state department.Macron’s ‘safe zone’ callRussia has welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron’s proposal to create a “safe zone” in Kabul to protect humanitarian operations. “This is certainly a proposal that must be discussed,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. He said that it was “very important” to discuss all aspects of “such a zone”.France and Britain will urge the United Nations Security Council on Monday to work for the creation of this secure area to “allow humanitarian work to continue”, Macron said.World needs to guide the Taliban: China tells USThe international community including the US should “guide” the Taliban, provide aid, stop the currency from depreciating and help maintain stability, Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi has told US secretary of state Antony Blinken.“The US should... help Afghanistan fight terrorism and stop violence, rather than playing double standards or fighting terrorism selectively,” Wang said in a phone call with Blinken.With inputs from Sutirtho Patranobis in Beijing||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/-is-attacks-will-stop-when-us-leaves-101630372627667.html
