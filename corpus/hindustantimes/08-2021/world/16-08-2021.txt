In an exclusive interview to the BBC, the Pakistani-origin activist said that every country has a “role and responsibility” to help the displaced people.“We have to take some bold stance for the protection of women and girls, for the protection of minority groups and for peace and stability in that region. I think every country has a role and responsibility right now. Countries need to open their borders to Afghan refugees, to the displaced people,” she told the BBC.Notably, Yousafzai, a Pakistani activist, was shot by the Taliban in 2012 for her campaign supporting girls’ education. She was later treated in a hospital in the UK. She received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 becoming the youngest ever Nobel winner.Also read | Military evacuation flights resume, total anarchy in KabulIn the video of the interview shared by the BBC, she called the situation in Afghanistan an urgent humanitarian crisis. “We are seeing some shocking images on our screens right now. People are just escaping, they are finding a way to keep themselves safe. So, when you see that, you realise that this is actually an urgent humanitarian crisis right now,” she said. “We are living in a world where we are talking about advancements, about equality, about gender equality. We can not see a country going decades and centuries back,” she further said.The comments came as several videos were shared by news agencies showing many people crowding the Kabul airport in a desperate attempt to leave the country. Many countries like the US, the UK and India are currently in the process of evacuating their personnel and diplomats, which is hindered by the closure of Kabul airport earlier in the day.She also said that she had written to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan urging him to take in refugees from Afghanistan. “I have sent a letter to Prime Minister Imran Khan (of Pakistan) asking him to allow refugees but also ensure that the refugee children and girls have access to education and have access to safety and protection,” she said. “Their futures are not lost, they can enroll in local schools, they can receive education within those refugee camps,” she added.Appealing to everyone to take a bold stance supporting the protection of human rights, Yousafzai said that the issue is not just about the peace of Afghanistan but globally. “I have not yet made contact with Prime Minister Boris Johnson (of the UK), but whoever can hear me right now, I think it’s important for them to remember that they have such an important strategic leadership role to play right now. And they must take a bold stance for the protection of human rights right now. It is important not just for the peace in Afghanistan but peace globally,” she told the BBC.Earlier on Monday, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) called for an emergency meeting regarding the situation in Afghanistan, during which the secretary-general Antonio Guterres and the US ambassador to the UN also called for global support. US ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said that the US would resettle Afghan nationals in its country and also called for more countries to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/their-futures-are-not-lost-malala-yousafzai-s-call-for-countries-to-open-borders-for-afghan-refugees-101629135764910.html
16-08-2021||World||Region will feel safer if Afghan soil isn’t used by terror groups: India at UNSC meet||India said on Monday that Afghanistan’s neighbours and the region would feel safer if Afghan soil isn’t used by terror groups to attack any other country as the UN Security Council debated the situation in the war-torn country following a Taliban takeover. Most of the 15 permanent and non-permanent members of the Security Council said the Taliban must ensure the territory of Afghanistan is not used by groups such as al-Qaeda and Islamic State. They called on the Taliban to ensure the security of foreign missions and humanitarian organisations during the second meeting on Afghanistan within 10 days under the Indian presidency of the UN body. However, remarks by the representatives of Russia and China hinted at a greater willingness to engage with the Taliban, who entered Kabul on Sunday after the civilian government collapsed as President Ashraf Ghani fled the country. Russia’s envoy to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, singled out Iran as an important regional player that could work with the “extended troika”, which includes Pakistan. India’s ambassador to the UN, TS Tirumurti, noted the situation in Afghanistan had dramatically changed since the last Security Council meeting 10 days ago, and was of “great concern” to New Delhi. He reiterated India’s call for respecting the rights of Afghan women, children and minorities, and added that a “broader representation would help the arrangement gain more acceptability and legitimacy”. “The current situation in Afghanistan has numerous challenges. However, there are a few opportunities. If there is a zero tolerance for terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and it is ensured that the territory of Afghanistan is not used by terrorist groups to threaten or attack any other country, then Afghanistan’s neighbours and the region would feel safer,” he said. Tirumurti noted that Afghan men, women and children are living in a constant state of fear amid increasing violations of their fundamental rights, and said: “We hope that the situation stabilises soon, and the parties concerned address the humanitarian and security issues. We also hope that there is an inclusive dispensation which represents all sections of Afghan society.” The world community and the Security Council should ensure an immediate cessation of violence and contain any possible crisis, and countries should rise above partisan interests to support Afghans to achieve peace, stability and security, he said. Recalling India’s contributions to the development of Afghanistan, Tirumurti said the country had ongoing development projects in all of the 34 Afghan provinces in critical areas such as power, water supply, road connectivity and healthcare. Russian envoy Nebenzia said Kabul had been “quickly abandoned by the country’s leader” and widespread bloodshed had been avoided as the Taliban entered the Afghan capital on Sunday. “Currently, we believe there is no point in panicking... Russia will interact with the Taliban irrespective of the evolving situation and their specific actions,” he added. Referring to Russia’s “extended troika” group that includes the US, China and Pakistan, Nebenzia said: “We believe that an important role could be played by Iran as well here.” Chinese deputy permanent representative Geng Shuang noted that some Security Council members desired a greater role to be played by Afghanistan’s neighbours, and, in an apparent reference to Pakistan, said: “We learnt that some regional countries and Afghanistan’s neighbours had made a request to participate in today’s meeting. It is regrettable that their requests were not granted.” Pakistan’s efforts to join both the Security Council meetings did not meet with success, with the body’s members turning down the country’s request. Geng further noted that the Taliban had said the war in Afghanistan has ended and that the group will negotiate to establish “an open and inclusive Islamic government” and take “responsible actions” for the safety of Afghans and foreign missions. He hoped the Taliban will unite with all parties and ethnic groups to establish a broad and inclusive political structure for lasting peace. Both Geng and Nebenzia also referred to threats posed to their countries by terror groups based in Afghanistan, such as Islamic State, al-Qaeda and ETIM, but made no mention of organisations such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed that pose concerns for India. US permanent representative Linda Thomas-Greenfield called on all parties to prevent terrorism and to ensure Afghanistan “cannot ever, ever again be a base for terrorism”, while the UK representative noted that the Taliban had pledged at Doha to engage in talks in good faith but “their actions on the ground have betrayed that promise”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/region-will-feel-safer-if-afghan-soil-isn-t-used-by-terror-groups-india-at-unsc-meet-101629137847306.html

16-08-2021||World||Military evacuation flights resume, total anarchy in Kabul||Military evacuation flights have resumed from Kabul airport even as anarchy reigns supreme in the Afghan capital with assorted insurgent and extremists group setting up check posts enroute to the airport and all evacuees at the mercy of the sundry Islamists.While India is awaiting its turn to evacuate its diplomats and key people, reports from Kabul indicate utter chaos with the Taliban cadre firing bullets to even regulate traffic and with no government to enforce the law. “The Taliban is trying to tell everyone that they will not take retaliatory or vengeful measures against anyone but the public is not convinced. To add to their fears, the Taliban is going door to door in Kabul with a list of government officials and journalists who wrote or spoke against them in the past,” said a civilian on phone from Kabul.After the mayhem at the Kabul international airport earlier on Monday, the US have taken control of the Air Traffic Control and technical area and are only allowing military flights to evacuate people with hundreds of Afghans waiting at the tarmac for their turn. The mood is very grim in Kabul with majority Afghans blaming the US forces for abandoning them to the extremists.Also read | After Taliban take over Afghanistan, countries urge for protection of human lifeHowever, diplomats in Kabul blame British Army Chief Nick Carter for blindsiding the US and cutting out a bad deal with the Taliban, leading to the ensuing chaos. The Chinese, Pakistanis and Russians, on their part, are enjoying their schadenfreude moment at the cost of the Joe Biden administration. It is another matter that the first decision to withdraw US forces from Afghanistan was taken by then President Barack Obama (Joe Biden was his Vice President) in June 22, 2011, speech on surge and then withdrawal of troops by 2014.According to Kabul watchers, the situation in Afghan capital is extremely precarious with sundry extremist and terrorist groups affiliated to so-called Islamic state, Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Tayebba (LeT) setting up road-blocks all over the city and making outlandish demands on hapless commuters. That a large section of Kabulites want to be evacuated is also a reflection on the popularity of the those who according to Pakistan PM delivered Afghanistan from 20 years of slavery.Also read | The turn in Afghanistan will threaten Indian securityIt appears from chaos in Kabul that even Taliban has various chapters with each group reporting to a different leader or group.

Some countries including Israel have already gone ahead with plans to give booster doses.However, the decision by a few rich countries to buy booster shots has drawn the ire of health activists and the World Health Organisation (WHO), which has called for a moratorium on boosters until at least the end of September.Also Read | WHO calls for moratorium on Covid booster shots as Delta variant threatens lives of unvaccinatedPfizer and BioNTech had said that all patients in the trial received the third shot, BNT162b2, eight to nine months after their second dose.The drugmakers will submit the trial data to the European Medicines Agency and other regulatory authorities in the coming weeks.

He briefed them regarding arrangements made by Pakistan to enable evacuation of diplomats and staff, INGOs, media, and representatives of international organisations, and others from Afghanistan.“The members of the Diplomatic Corps were informed that all requests for evacuation/relocation may be directed to the ministry of foreign affairs, which will be processed expeditiously,” PTI reported quoting a foreign office statement.In the matter of rendering assistance to Pakistani citizens in Afghanistan, the foreign office stated that it was not only contributing in that but the embassy of Pakistan in Kabul was also working to extend requisite consular services for such facilitation.The embassy continued to issue visas on a fast-track basis, and procedures have also been arranged to grant visas-on-arrival at Pakistan’s international airports, the foreign office said according to PTI.A 24/7 special inter-ministerial cell or facilitation centre has been set up in the ministry of interior to aid in such visas on arrival matters, and the telephone numbers of the centre were also shared with the Diplomatic Corps for smooth coordination associated with the evacuation.The foreign office further stated that starting August 15, Pakistan commenced to receive special flights from Kabul. “Pakistan will continue to provide all possible assistance and facilitation to the international community for the smooth and expeditious evacuation from Afghanistan,” the foreign office was quoted as saying by PTI.The statement from the foreign office came after two Pakistan International Airline (PIA) flights on Sunday brought back nearly 500 stranded persons from Kabul, even as more flights are scheduled, officials told PTI.However, quoting a spokesperson of PIA, Geo News reported on Monday that the national carrier suspended flight operations to Kabul for an “unidentified period” after a “large number of people gathered at the runway” trying to flee as Taliban regained control over Afghanistan after two decades.Notably, the carrier had plans to operate three flights between Islamabad and Kabul to bring back several more Pakistanis and other nationals wishing to depart from Kabul.This development comes after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday praised the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan by saying Afghans have “broken the shackles of slavery”. His comments come in the backdrop of Afghanistan blaming Pakistan for providing supplies, including arms, medical aid and logistics to the Taliban.Watch here | Imran Khan praises Taliban takeover, calls it 'breaking chains of slavery'The group had been on a rampage for the past several weeks, capturing almost all the major provincial capitals before making their entry into Kabul on Sunday, and later in the day taking over the presidential palace.Afghan president Ashraf Ghani and some of his close aides fled the country as the Taliban were approaching the capital.

Soon after India assumed the presidency of the Security Council, for a month, starting on August 1, UNSC convened a meeting on Afghanistan on August 6 amid stalled talks between the now-defunct Afghan government and the Taliban in Doha and just days before the extended Troika meeting — of Pakistan, China and the US — in Qatar on August 11.Panic gripped Kabul after the Taliban took control of Afghanistan's presidential palace on Sunday following President Ashraf Ghani's escape to a central Asian country. The Islamist insurgents were waiting to take over the Afghan capital.Thousands of people were seen gathering at the international airport in Kabul, the only exit points out of the country not in control of the Taliban yet, in a last-ditch effort to leave the war-torn nation, even as the administration shut the civilian airspace over Afghanistan.ALSO READ | Closure of Kabul airport puts pause on repatriation of IndiansVisuals shared on various social media platforms showed hundreds of people running across the airport tarmac American soldiers fired warning shots into the air, also prompting temporary hold on its evacuation process from Kabul to clear the airfield.Even as the Taliban have said no one would be “harmed”, thousands of people are desperate to flee the country as many Afghans were apprehensive of the Taliban rule.Guterres also urged all countries to be willing to receive Afghan refugees and asked them to refrain from deporting them back to the war-torn nation now taken over by the Taliban."The international community must unite to make sure that Afghanistan is never again used as a platform or safe haven for terrorist organisations," Guterres told the UNSC, according to Reuters.ALSO READ | After Taliban take over Afghanistan, countries urge for protection of human lifeThe UN chief also urged the Taliban to "exercise utmost restraint" to protect lives."The message from the international community to those on the warpath must be clear: seizing power through military force is a losing proposition ...

The Uzbek government also said that the plane had crossed the border “illegally” and the incident is currently being probed.“The military plane illegally crossed the border of Uzbekistan. An investigation is underway,” news agency AFP quoted ministry spokesperson Bakhrom Zulfikarov as saying, earlier in the day.Meanwhile, some news reports showed that the plane was shot down and the pilot ejected out of it. The Uzbek air defences shot the plane down as it tried to violate the border, news agency Reuters reported citing the country’s defence ministry.“Uzbekistan's air defence forces prevented an attempt by an Afghan military aircraft to illegally cross Uzbekistan's border,” Reuters quoted spokesperson Zulfikarov as saying on Monday.Uzbekistan is one of the many countries that share a border with the land-locked Afghanistan. The spokesperson’s comments confirmed the Uzbek media reports about a plane crash that took place late Sunday in the country’s southern province of Surkhondaryo bordering Afghanistan, AFP further reported.Earlier on Sunday, the Uzbek news website Gazeta.uz reported that a plane with Afghan insignia crashed in the Sherabad district of Surkhandarya region and several users had shared pictures and videos of the crash on social media.On Monday, the spokesperson also confirmed the crash to Russian news agency TASS. “Indeed, an Afghan Air Force plane crashed the other day in the Surkhandarya region of Uzbekistan. Currently, the details of the incident are being studied and the relevant information will be reported later,” Zulfikarov had told TASS.Further, Bekpulat Okboyev, a doctor in the Surkhondaryo province, said that two patients wearing Afghan military uniforms were taken in by his hospital on Sunday evening, AFP also reported. Also, one of the patients came in “with a parachute” and had suffered fractures, the doctor added.Uzbekistan’s foreign ministry on Sunday also said that 84 Afghan servicemen crossed the border into their country seeking assistance. The ministry further said that the group, including three wounded personnel, was detained by the Uzbek guards after they crossed over and was offered food and temporary accommodation.

16-08-2021||World||Closure of Kabul airport puts pause on repatriation of Indians||India on Monday pledged to stand by its Afghan partners but said the suspension of operations at Kabul airport has “forced a pause” in the government’s efforts to repatriate its officials and nationals following the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban. The government is working to facilitate the repatriation of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus who wish to leave Afghanistan as well as some Indian nationals, who are still in the war-torn country, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said. “The security situation in Kabul has deteriorated significantly in the last few days. It is changing rapidly even as we speak,” Bagchi said in the first official reaction from the Indian side to the fall of President Ashraf Ghani’s government after the Taliban marched into Kabul on Sunday. “Commercial operations from Kabul airport have been suspended [on Monday]. This has forced a pause in our repatriation efforts. We are awaiting the resumption of flights to restart the process,” Bagchi said. The sudden closure of Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport threw schedules for the few remaining airlines operating flights to Afghanistan into disarray, including Air India, which had a flight scheduled for 12.30 pm. Two NOTAMs or notices to airmen – official notices containing essential information on flight operations – issued by the Afghanistan Civil Aviation Authority said the civilian side of the airport was “closed until further notice” and that Kabul’s airspace “has been released to the military”. The second NOTAM advised all “transit aircraft to reroute” and cautioned that “any transit through Kabul airspace will be uncontrolled”. Chaos reigned at Kabul airport, which was under the control of US troops, as thousands of desperate Afghans entered the terminal building and walked on to the tarmac in hopes of getting on to any of the aircraft taking off. Amid sporadic firing by the US troops, there were reports that five people were killed. At least two more people who had clung to an US military jet fell to their deaths. Bagchi said the Indian side is in constant touch with representatives of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus and will “facilitate repatriation to India of those who wish to leave Afghanistan”. He added, “There are also a number of Afghans who have been our partners in the promotion of our mutual developmental, educational and people-to-people endeavours. We will stand by them.” At the same time, the Indian side is “aware that there are still some Indian nationals in Afghanistan who wish to return and we are in touch with them”, Bagchi said. Last year, the Indian government had helped more than 380 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus to travel to the country. The situation in Afghanistan, Bagchi said, is being monitored on a constant basis at high levels, and the government “will take all steps to ensure the safety and security of Indian nationals and our interests in Afghanistan”. He pointed out that several advisories had been issued for the safety and security of Indian nationals in Afghanistan, including calling for their immediate return home. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that a few hundred Indians, including diplomats, officials and security personnel posted at the embassy in Kabul, and citizens were currently in Kabul. Military aircraft have been on standby for evacuation flights and two C-17 Globemaster heavy lift aircraft have been sent to Kabul via Iranian airspace since Sunday. One of these aircraft returned on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/closure-of-kabul-airport-puts-pause-on-repatriation-of-indians-101629121645840.html

The Islamist insurgents were waiting to take over the Afghan capital. Even as Taliban have said no one would be “harmed”, thousands of people are desperate to flee the country. But many Afghans were apprehensive of the Taliban rule and feared the return of draconian practices with the imposition of Shariah. During Taliban's previous rule between 1996 and 2001, women could not work and kangaroo courts meted out ‘punishments’ such as public stoning, whipping and hanging.The rapidity with which the Taliban took over various provinces of the country, 20 years after they were routed, has stunned the US officials. Just days before the Taliban fighters entered Kabul with barely any resistance, an American military analysis had predicted it could take months for the Afghan capital to fall.A spokesperson for Taliban's political office, Mohammad Naeem told Al Jazeera television that the people of Afghanistan and the Taliban had just “witnessed the fruits of their efforts and sacrifices over 20 years”, as he declared that the “war is over."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-air-force-kabul-airport-afghanistan-evacuation-taliban-takeover-101629115645345.html

16-08-2021||World||Haiti hospitals overwhelmed by quake victims as death toll hits 1,297||Haiti's hospitals were swamped on Sunday by thousands of injured residents after a devastating earthquake the day before killed at least 1,297 people as authorities raced to bring doctors to the worst-hit areas before a major storm hits.The 7.2 magnitude quake on Saturday destroyed thousands of homes and buildings in a Caribbean nation which is still clawing its way back from another major temblor 11 years ago and is reeling from the assassination of its president last month.Southwestern Haiti bore the brunt of the blow, especially in the region in and around the town of Les Cayes. Haiti's Civil Protection Agency said the toll from the disaster had climbed to 1,297 and the hospitals that were still functioning were struggling to cope as some 5,700 people were injured.In the northwestern city of Jeremie, another badly hit area, doctors treated injured patients on hospital stretchers underneath trees and on mattresses by the side of the road, as healthcare centers have run out of space."We do have a serious issue," Jerry Chandler, the head of Haiti's Civil Protection Agency, told Reuters."There are very important facilities that are dysfunctional as we speak and those that are functional are receiving an overflow of patients," he said.The challenge facing Haiti has been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, a severe economic downturn aggravated by fierce gang violence, and a political crisis that has engulfed the troubled nation after the assassination of President Jovenel Moise on July 7.Churches, hotels, hospitals and schools were badly damaged or destroyed, while the walls of a prison were rent open by the violent shudders that convulsed Haiti. Some 13,694 houses were destroyed, the civil protection agency said, suggesting the toll could rise further.In Les Cayes, a seafront town of some 90,000 people, rescuers in red hard hats and blue overalls pulled bodies from the tangled wreckage of one building, as a yellow mechanical excavator nearby helped to shift the rubble.Haiti's Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who flew to visit Les Cayes, praised the dignity shown by people there even in the midst of their suffering."They are affected but resilient. They fight to survive," he said, thanking international agencies and foreign governments for their support.Nearby countries, including the Dominican Republic and Mexico, rushed to send desperately needed food and medicines by air and across Haiti's land border. Colombia sent search and rescue personnel.The United States dispatched vital supplies and deployed a 65-person urban search-and-rescue team with specialized equipment, said Samantha Power, the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).From the Vatican, Pope Francis urged the international community to show support swiftly. "May solidarity from everyone lighten the consequences of the tragedy," he told pilgrims and tourists at his Sunday blessing in St. Peter's Square.However, Haiti's government appealed to aid organizations against setting up makeshift camps and urged them to work through the planning ministry, an apparent attempt to avoid the mistakes made following the devastating 2010 earthquake https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/haitis-history-violence-rebellion-2021-07-23 that killed tens of thousands of people.Many Haitians prepared on Sunday to spend a second night sleeping in the open, traumatized by memories of that magnitude 7 quake 11 years ago that struck far closer to the sprawling capital, Port-au-Prince.At Port-au-Prince airport, international aid workers, doctors and rescue workers boarded flights to Les Cayes. A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter ferried the wounded.The rescue and aid efforts will be complicated by Tropical Depression Grace, which is expected to lash Haiti with heavy rainfall on Monday. Some 75 to 100 milliliters of rainfall was expected, which may trigger landslides and cause some rivers to flood, Haiti's Civil Protection Agency said."We ask the population to remain vigilant," the agency added.Thousands of people sleeping in the streets would be exposed to the torrential rains amid a rising risk of water-borne diseases, said Chandler, the head of the agency.The death toll is expected to rise as the telephone network has been down in more remote areas. In difficult-to-reach villages many houses were fragile and built on slopes vulnerable to landslides, said Alix Percinthe, from the ActionAid charity.He said one local leader had informed him there were 47 deaths in his area not yet reported to regional authorities. Footage of Saturday's aftermath posted on social media showed residents reaching into narrow openings in piles of fallen masonry to pull shocked and distraught people from the debris of walls and roofs that had crumbled around them.Access to the worst-hit areas was complicated by a deterioration in law and order that has left key access roads in parts of Haiti in the hands of gangs. In a video posted on social media, one gang leader said the armed groups had declared a truce along the route to Les Cayes.Chandler said boats and helicopters were being used to bring in aid but the government was working to establish safe access by road. The first convoy of aid had made it through by land to the region of Les Cayes.The United Nations called for a "humanitarian corridor" to be established so that aid can pass through gang-held territories.Following Moise's assassination, which authorities have alleged was carried out by a group of largely Colombian mercenaries and Haitian accomplices, Prime Minister Henry said officials would aim to hold elections for a new president as soon as possible.However, reports this week suggested that the vote initially earmarked for September would not take place until November. The chaos unleashed https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/haiti-one-month-without-assassinated-president-jovenel-moise-2021-08-06 by Saturday's disaster is likely to make the task of holding prompt elections harder still.Haiti has long been politically unstable and Haitians have also suffered from problems stemming from international aid efforts and peace-keeping deployments during the past decade.A sexual misconduct scandal centering on Oxfam International blighted the record of charity workers in Haiti, while a cholera outbreak linked to U.N. peacekeepers led to thousands of deaths. (Additional reporting by Kate Chappell in Kingston, Sarah Marsh in Havana and Philip Pullella, Olive Griffin; Writing by Dave Graham, Drazen Jorgic; Editing by Daniel Flynn, Chizu Nomiyama and Diane Craft)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/haiti-hospitals-overwhelmed-by-quake-victims-as-death-toll-hits-1297-101629110969475.html
16-08-2021||World||Hope Taliban will lead an inclusive Afghan govt: China||China said on Monday it hopes Taliban will make good its promise to ensure smooth transition of Afghanistan under an open and inclusive Islamic government, hours after the insurgent group swept unopposed into capital Kabul and took control of the presidential palace.It respects the wishes of the Afghan people and is willing to continue to develop friendly ties with Afghanistan, the Chinese foreign ministry said in its first comments on the rapid changes in Afghanistan’s political landscape.Beijing’s expected endorsement of the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan comes a day after Washington-propped President Ashraf Ghani fled the country.“China respects the Afghan people’s right to decide their own destiny and future, and is willing to continue to develop friendly cooperation with Afghanistan. China will play a constructive role for peace and reconstruction in Afghanistan,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said on Monday.Asked whether China will recognise a Taliban government, Hua said China expects that an inclusive political arrangement that is acceptable to all Afghan people will lay the foundation for lasting peace in the country.“Based on fully respecting the national sovereignty of Afghanistan and the will of various factions in the country, China has maintained contact and communication with the Afghan Taliban and played a constructive role in promoting the political settlement of the Afghan issue,” she saidBeijing and its future role in war-torn Afghanistan has been at the centre of much speculation since US President Joe Biden announced in April a full withdrawal of American troops from the country with a 70-odd km border with China.The high-profile meeting between Taliban leaders and Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi in July added to the conjecture. Wang said the Taliban would “play an important role in the process of peaceful reconciliation and reconstruction in Afghanistan”, after the meeting.That diplomatic forecast by the senior Chinese diplomat is coming true. “The Afghan Taliban said yesterday [Sunday] that the war in Afghanistan has ended and they will negotiate the establishment of an open and inclusive Islamic government and take responsible actions to ensure the safety of Afghan citizens and foreign missions in Afghanistan,” Hua said.“China hopes that these statements can be implemented to ensure the smooth transition of the situation in Afghanistan, curb all kinds of terrorism and criminal acts, and enable the Afghan people to stay away from war and rebuild their beautiful homeland,” Hua said.Hua’s statement was a reminder of what the same delegation, which met foreign minister Wang last month had told him: The Taliban would not allow Afghanistan to become a militant base to fuel separatism in Xinjiang, a strategic apprehension for Beijing.China welcomes the Taliban’s promise that they will allow no force to use the Afghan territory to engage in acts detrimental to China and its expression of hope that China will be more involved in Afghanistan’s peace and reconciliation process and play a bigger role in future reconstruction and economic development, Hua said.“The Taliban have repeatedly expressed their hope to develop good relations with China, and that they look forward to China’s participation in the reconstruction and development of Afghanistan,” Hua added.“We welcome this. China respects the right of the Afghan people to independently determine their own destiny and is willing to continue to develop... friendly and cooperative relations with Afghanistan.”She confirmed that the Chinese embassy in capital Kabul was functioning “as usual” and that the majority of Chinese citizens in the country had been evacuated in advance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hope-taliban-will-lead-an-inclusive-afghan-govt-china-101629113306422.html

16-08-2021||World||As Delta variant spreads, travelers double up on COVID-19 vaccine in U.S.||WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Alison Toni felt lucky to get Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine in Chile earlier this year. A month later, she was in Minnesota getting vaccinated again.Toni, an American living in Chile, was visiting her parents in Minneapolis in April when she got her first Pfizer shot at a CVS pharmacy. She traveled back for the second dose in June. She did not disclose being previously vaccinated."They didn't ask, and I didn't tell," said Toni, 55. She took that step after reading that China's Sinovac vaccine had a lower efficacy than the Pfizer Inc shot, developed with German partner BioNTech, and the Moderna Inc shot, both widely available in the United States. She also consulted with her doctor beforehand.Toni is among the group of people coming from abroad who have been vaccinated a second time, or plan to do so, in the United States.Their reasons range from concerns that the vaccines immediately available to them were not effective enough, fears that they require extra protection against the fast-spreading Delta variant, or a need to meet specific requirements for work or travel. Some are seeking medical advice, others are relying on their own research.A few countries are also beginning to offer a third booster dose to their citizens based on evidence that the initial protection from vaccines wanes over time, or that an extra shot may help prevent infection against Delta, particularly for older people or those with weak immune systems.Public health officials have not determined if booster doses are needed for the general population, and there is not yet much data on the relative risks and benefits of complete revaccination."It is probably more than is needed," said Jason Gallagher, an infectious diseases expert at Temple University's School of Pharmacy. "A fourth dose is probably a waste; a third dose is probably unnecessary for a lot of people."The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged countries to hold off on boosters while many people worldwide wait to receive their first doses.Thirty-six-year-old Chilean engineer Ricardo Dayne, who first received Sinovac's vaccine at home in April got his first Pfizer shot in New York in June."Everyone was also talking about the need to have a booster, so I decided to have it."The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last week authorized a third vaccine dose for immunocompromised people. Government health officials have estimated that would apply to less than 3% of the adult U.S. population, but have said that eventually, boosters may be required more broadly.In the meantime, a surplus of vaccines in the United States, along with a decentralized healthcare system, has made it easier for people to show up at pharmacies and vaccination centers for extra doses. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that over 1.2 million Americans have already received at least one extra dose following their initial inoculation.When asked about travelers doubling up on vaccines, Moderna told Reuters its vaccine is not authorized for this purpose and J&J directed Reuters to the FDA and CDC. Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A CVS Health Corp spokesperson said the company's policy is to turn away patients who have been fully vaccinated at one of its pharmacies, or who disclose that they have been fully vaccinated elsewhere. A Walgreens spokesperson said its pharmacies ask patients if they have been vaccinated during the appointment process and have alerts in place to check.Graduate student Jing Wu, 22, said he had no choice. Wu received the Sinovac vaccine in December while in China before moving to the United States to attend Princeton University.He heard Princeton was planning to require proof of an FDA-approved vaccine. The university's health service urged him to get vaccinated again and said it would be safe.He was not reassured."I was nervous and stressed about it, but in April I got vaccinated (again)," he said, this time with the Johnson & Johnson shot.Princeton announced the policy on April 20 but later decided to accept any WHO-approved vaccine, including Sinovac. The university's health website still states that "there is no known harm from taking additional" vaccines.The university did not respond to requests for comment."If I knew back then the Chinese vaccine would be enough, I wouldn't have done it," Wu said.The United States is developing a plan to require nearly all foreign visitors be fully vaccinated, potentially creating similar issues for many people inoculated with vaccines not approved by the FDA.Britain and the European Union's lists of approved vaccines do not include shots made in Russia or China, which have been used in many countries.Governments should standardize their definition of fully vaccinated to include shots that may not be approved in their countries, but which are still effective, said Dr Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security."This whole process needs to be fixed, otherwise, as we get more vaccines and more people traveling, this will only happen more," Adalja said.(Reporting by Ahmed Aboulenein; Additional reporting by Aislinn Laing in Santiago, Carl O'Donnell and Michael Erman in New York; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Aurora Ellis)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-delta-variant-travelers-double-up-on-vaccine-in-us-101629108207762.html

Khan further spoke about how cultural imposition was tantamount to ‘mental slavery’, according to Pakistan news platform Dawn.com.Addressing the launch of a government education programme, Khan further criticised the existence of “English medium schools” that he said led to the adoption of “someone else’s culture” in Pakistan. “When you adopt someone’s culture you believe it to be superior and you end up becoming a slave to it,” the cricketing legend-turned-premier was quoted as saying.In the same breath, he indirectly likened the ongoing upheaval in Afghanistan with the people of the country breaking the “shackles of slavery".The Taliban’s takeover of the war-torn nation was completed on Sunday when their armed troops swept into capital Kabul without minimal resistance after days of rapid advances, said to be powered by Pakistan with weapons, logistics and medical aid.

He stated that a poor harvest is projected as the nation has been hit by a second drought in four years, reported VOA. "We fear the worst is yet to come and a larger tide of hunger is fast approaching," Phiri said, adding that “It is not a secret the situation has worsened and is becoming increasingly unpredictable. The conflict has accelerated much faster than we all anticipated.

16-08-2021||World||As Taliban take control of Afghanistan, a look at who's who of the leadership||The Taliban, after taking control of the presidential palace in Kabul, declared on Monday that the war in Afghanistan was over. President Ashraf Ghani has fled to central Asian country of Tajikistan, and western countries are scrambling to evacuate their citizens.There is chaos at the Kabul airport as frantic Afghans are searching for a way out."Today is a great day for the Afghan people and the mujahideen. They have witnessed the fruits of their efforts and their sacrifices for 20 years," Mohammad Naeem, the spokesman for the Taliban's political office, told Al Jazeera TV.It took the Taliban just over a week to seize control of Afghanistan, 20 years after they were ousted by the American and allied forces. The insurgents overran the country in the wake of the withdrawal of US troops.Who are the Taliban?The movement's inner workings and leadership have always been largely shrouded in secrecy. Here is a rundown of what is known about its structure, and other intriguing facts about the insurgents.Haibatullah Akhundzada: He was appointed as the supreme leader of the Taliban in a power transition after a US drone strike killed his predecessor, Mullah Mansour Akhtar, in 2016.Akhundzada's public profile has somehow been limited to annual messages during Islamic holidays.Mullah Baradar: One of the co-founders, Abdul Ghani Baradar was raised in Kandahar, the birthplace of Taliban. The Soviet invasion in the 1970s turned him into an insurgent. Baradar and cleric Mullah Omar later founded the Taliban in the early 1990s.Mullah Yaqoob: He's the son of Taliban founder Mullah Omar. He heads the powerful military commission, which oversees a vast network of field commanders charged with executing the insurgency's strategic operations.Sirajuddin Haqqani: The son of a commander from the anti-Soviet jihad, Jalaluddin Haqqani, Sirajuddin doubles up as deputy leader of the movement while heading the powerful Haqqani network, a US-designated terror group.The rise of TalibanGenesis: The Taliban, which means "students" in Pashto language, emerged in 1994 around the city of Kandahar. They were the main factions fighting a civil war after the Soviets left Afghanistan. They went on the draw members from the "mujahideen" who, with the support of the United States, repelled the Soviets back in the 1980s. Much later, they gained sole control over most of Afghanistan, proclaiming a powerful Islamic Emirate in 1996 and staying firmly in power until 2001.Modus operandi: During their 1996-2001 reign in the country, they enforced a hugely unpopular and internationally condemned strict version of sharia law. Women across the country were strictly barred from working or studying; they were confined to their homes unless accompanied by a male guardian outdoors. Public executions and floggings were also a common sight. Western films and books were banned. Cultural artefacts seen as blasphemous were destroyed.Global recognition: Only four countries, including neighbour Pakistan, formally recognised the Taliban government when it was in power. Other countries around the world, along with the United Nations, instead recognised a different group holding provinces to the north of Kabul as Afghanistan's government-in-waiting. The US and UN imposed strict sanctions on the Taliban. Even now, most countries are showing no signs of formally recogni the group diplomatically.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-taliban-take-control-of-afghanistan-a-look-at-who-s-who-of-the-leadership-101629093873213.html

Visuals shared by news agency ANI on Monday showed scores of Afghan nationals gathered outside the White House, shouting slogans such as “Biden you betrayed us”, “Biden you are responsible”. The protesters also decried the Taliban’s actions back home and said Afghanistan's citizens don’t deserve any of this. “Death to Taliban” was another slogan that echoed outside President Biden’s official residence."The women of Afghanistan will have no freedom. We do not want to go back to the burqa's that is not freedom," Farzana Hafiz, who lives in Northern Virginia, told ANI. "My family is there and I'm dying every minute. Since last night I haven't slept yet. I couldn't sleep. It's a tragedy for my people. I can't sleep," she said as she broke down.Hafiza says her 21-year-old nephew was trying to come out of Afghanistan. "He was to get his visa and he would then come to us, but now we don't know what lies in his future," she told ANI.#WATCH | "Biden you betrayed us, Biden you are responsible," chanted Afghan nationals outside the White House against the US President after Afghanistan's capital Kabul fell to the Taliban pic.twitter.com/giMjt2grNWJoe Biden, who ordered the pullout of US troops from Afghanistan, has not yet issued any official statement or post on his social media handles regarding the intensifying crisis in the war-torn country. He is on a vacation at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland. White House advisors pointed out that they were discussing ways of how the president should address the situation in Afghanistan.Former US president Donald Trump, meanwhile, blamed his successor for the crisis in Afghanistan and demanded his resignation from the top post. Issuing a statement on Sunday, Trump said it was time for Joe Biden to step down “for what he has allowed to happen in Afghanistan, along with the tremendous surge in Covid-19, the Border catastrophe, the destruction of energy Independence, and our crippled economy.”Taliban fighters declared on Monday that the war in Afghanistan is over after taking over Kabul and later the presidential palace as several countries are racing against time to evacuate their citizens. “Today is a great day for the Afghan people and the mujahideen.

Calling for peaceful international relations, Naeem said the Taliban did not want to live in isolation, adding “We will not allow anyone to use our lands to target anyone, and we do not want to harm others.”(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/you-betrayed-us-afghan-nationals-protest-against-biden-outside-white-house-101629093911790.html

16-08-2021||World||Malaysia's cabinet-led by PM Yassin has resigned, says science minister||Malaysia's prime minister and his government resigned Monday after just 17 months in office, throwing the country into fresh political turmoil as it battles a serious coronavirus outbreak.Muhyiddin Yassin's tumultuous period in office came to an end after allies withdrew support and a last-ditch bid to cling to power failed, and he becomes the shortest serving premier in Malaysian history.After a final cabinet meeting, the 74-year-old headed to the national palace to submit his resignation to the king.Science Minister Khairy Jamaluddin confirmed on Instagram that the entire cabinet had quit."Thank you for the opportunity to, once again, serve the nation," he wrote.Mohamad Redzuan Yusof, a minister in the prime minister's office, confirmed to AFP that Muhyiddin had tendered his resignation, and it had been accepted.Muhyiddin was reportedly set to address the nation later Monday.There is no clear successor to Muhyiddin but an election looks unlikely as the country faces its worst Covid-19 wave yet and an economic downturn.Rather, a period of political horse-trading is expected before a new coalition emerges that can command a majority in parliament."His replacement is anybody's guess," said Oh Ei Sun, an analyst at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs.Malaysia's constitutional monarch formally appoints the premier, and it will be up to him to assess who has sufficient backing from MPs.Muhyiddin came to power in March last year without an election at the head of a scandal-plagued coalition following the collapse of a two-year-old, reformist government led by nonagenarian political heavyweight Mahathir Mohamad.But his government faced turmoil from day one -- his majority in parliament was in doubt, its legitimacy was constantly questioned, and he faced a constant challenge from opposition chief Anwar Ibrahim.Criticism over virus responseThe demise of his government extends a period of political drama for the multi-ethnic nation of 32 million.After independence from Britain in 1957, Malaysia was ruled for over six decades by a coalition dominated by the country's ethnic Malay Muslim majority.But corruption scandals, unpopular race-based policies and increasingly authoritarian rule prompted weary voters to boot the coalition and its leader Najib Razak out of power at 2018 polls.The victory of Mahathir's opposition alliance fuelled hopes for a new era, but it collapsed amid bitter infighting.Muhyiddin, who had been a member of Mahathir's government but ended up plotting its downfall, hammered together a ramshackle coalition.As well as questions over its legitimacy, it faced mounting criticism over its failure to keep the virus outbreak under control -- officials have now reported over 1.1 million cases and 12,000 deaths.In January, Muhyiddin persuaded the king to declare Malaysia's first nationwide state of emergency for over half a century, ostensibly to fight the pandemic.But parliament was also suspended for months, leading to criticism that Muhyiddin was using the crisis to avoid a no-confidence vote.Muhyiddin's position finally became untenable after a group of once allied MPs withdrew support, depriving him of a parliamentary majority, and the king, Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah, turned against him.He made his last bid to stay in power on Friday, appealing to opposition MPs to back him in a no-confidence vote -- but his offer was rejected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysias-cabinet-led-by-pm-yassin-has-resigned-says-science-minister-101629091898082.html

The US embassy in Kabul has also been completely evacuated, the department also informed hours after the Taliban insurgents captured the presidential palace in the capital city."All embassy personnel are located on the premises of Hamid Karzai International Airport, whose perimeter is secured by the US Military," spokesman Ned Price said in a statement.According to a Reuters report, all Americans in Afghanistan are expected to be evacuated in the next two to three days. For this, the US has approved another 6,000 troops to facilitate the evacuation process of Americans and Afghan citizens who were working for them from Kabul."Over the next 48 hours, we will have expanded our security presence to nearly 6,000 troops, with a mission focused solely on facilitating these efforts and will be taking over air traffic control," the state department said in a statement. "Tomorrow and over the coming days, we will be transferring out of the country thousands of American citizens who have been resident in Afghanistan, as well as locally employed staff of the US mission in Kabul and their families and other particularly vulnerable Afghan nationals," it added.Meanwhile, Nato allies are also sending troops back to Afghanistan to protect evacuations of their own. They had pulled out their forces ahead of the Biden administration's intended August 31 withdrawal deadline.This comes as residents near Kabul airport reported sporadic gunfire. The US also confirmed this and said that it has instructed US citizens to take shelter in a safe place. "There are reports of the airport taking fire; therefore we are instructing US citizens to shelter in place," the US embassy said in a security alert.Afghanistan was plunged into crisis as the US troops started withdrawing from the country in May and the Taliban made rapid advances capturing city after city. And on Sunday, they reached Kabul city and declared that the war is over and captured the presidential palace. President Ashraf Ghani has already fled the country."Today is a great day for the Afghan people and the mujahideen.

16-08-2021||World||US President Biden faces flak at home for Afghan pull-out||CNN news anchor JakeTapper’s first question to US secretary of state Antony Blinken on his Sunday morning show captured the sense of how the rest of the United States was viewing President Joe Biden’s recent decisions on Afghanistan: “How did President Biden get this so wrong?”As morning hour wore on and Al Jazeera news channel began running clips of Taliban fighters walking around inside the President Palace abandoned by former president Ashraf Ghani, Biden was facing similar questions from both supporters and critics, with varying degrees of outrage and frustration.“This is going to be a stain on this president and this presidency,” said Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Relations Committee, on the same programme with Tapper. “I think he is going to have blood on his hands for what they did.”Ryan Crocker, who was president Barack Obama’s ambassador to Afghanistan, could sense the impending disaster. “I’m left with some grave questions in my mind about his ability to lead our nation as commander-in-chief,” Crocker told The Spokesman-Review, a Washington state publication, on Sunday morning, shortly before news came of the Taliban entering Kabul.“To have read this so wrong - or, even worse, to have understood what was likely to happen and not care,” the former ambassador of the Obama-Biden administration added.Biden did not issue any statement or posted a tweet all day. He is vacationing at the Camp David presidential retreat in the adjoining state of Maryland. News reports suggested he is expected to address the nation in the next few days, which in itself is odd given the urgency of the situation.As questions began to be raise about where was the president at this critical juncture in the nation’s history, the White House released a picture of him at a long table in a room with flags in a virtual conference with his national security team. Dressed in a casual t-shirt, he looked terribly alone.“This morning, the president and vice-president met with their national security team and senior officials to hear updates on the drawdown of our civilian personnel in Afghanistan, evacuations of SIV (special immigration visa) applicants and other Afghan allies, and the ongoing security situation in Kabul,” the White House wrote in the tweet.Barely a month ago, Biden has strenuously discounted any chance of the Taliban gaining early control of Kabul and the country. “Afghan troops have 300,000 well-equipped - as well-equipped as any army in the world - and an air force against something like 75,000 Taliban. It is not inevitable,” he had said on July 8 when asked if Taliban takeover was inevitable.More recently, Biden has said he does not regret the decision to pull US forces out of Afghanistan ending a “forever war”, but as the Taliban advanced swiftly in recent days to take control of the country, he has sought to deflect some of the criticism of his own actions by pointing to the flawed deal he inherited from Trump.“I inherited a deal cut by my predecessor - which he invited the Taliban to discuss at Camp David on the eve of 9/11 of 2019 -that left the Taliban in the strongest position militarily since 2001 and imposed a May 1, 2021 deadline on US forces,” Biden said, referring to a meeting that Trump had wanted to host at Camp David but did not.Trump had also drawn down US forces to a “a bare minimum of 2,500”, Biden, said, adding, that when he took over as president, he had two choices “follow through on the deal, with a brief extension to get our forces and our allies’ forces out safely, or ramp up our presence and send more American troops to fight once again in another country’s civil conflict”.Biden and his officials have since gone on to blame the “hollow” response of the Afghan army and security forces and their inability to hold off the Taliban despite their numerical superiority and better American-supplied equipment.“We would have been back at war with tens of thousands of troops having to go in because the 2,500 troops we had there and the air power would not have sufficed to deal with the situation, especially as we see, alas, the hollowness of the Afghan security forces.” Blinken said in the CNN interview.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-faces-flak-at-home-for-afghan-pullout-101629085823368.html

16-08-2021||World||Anthony Fauci says US can move quickly to offer 3rd vaccine shots||Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, said the U.S. will be “absolutely prepared” to distribute a third shot of the coronavirus vaccine quickly to a wider population if needed.He gave no timeline but said health officials are evaluating various groups “on a daily and weekly basis.”“So if it turns out, as the data come in, we see we do need to give an additional dose to people in nursing homes, actually, or people who are elderly we will be absolutely prepared to do that very quickly,” he said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”The issue of extra, or booster, shots has become more pressing, amid questions about “breakthrough” infections among the fully vaccinated, particularly with the more contagious delta variant now prevalent in the U.S., and whether the shots’ efficacy declines over time. Last week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved a third shot for people with compromised immune systems.The New York Times reported on Saturday that, with 100 million doses stockpiled, the Biden administration has begun drawing up plans to offer booster shots to some Americans as early as this fall.‘Nasty One’Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said no decision had been made “because right now the data we have from the U.S. says people who are vaccinated are fully protected, even against delta.”But, Collins said on Fox News “Sunday,” “there is a concern that the vaccine may start to wane in its effectiveness over months. And delta is a nasty one for us to try to deal with. The combination of those two means we may need boosters, maybe beginning first with health care providers, as well as people in nursing homes, and then gradually moving forward.”Fauci also raised the issue of possibly stronger mandates either to wear masks or to get inoculated, at a time when he said 90 million in the U.S. who are eligible remain unvaccinated. He has in the past advocated voluntary vaccine mandates at the local level and in businesses.“We’ve got to do mitigation, put aside all of these issues of concern about liberties and personal liberties and realize we have a common enemy, and that common enemy is the virus,” he said. “And we really have to all pull together to get on top of this otherwise, we’re going to continue to suffer as we’re seeing right now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-says-us-can-move-quickly-to-offer-3rd-vaccine-shots-101629081359019.html

Ghani left as the insurgents closed in on Afghanistan's capital before entering the city and taking over the presidential palace.Ghani in his first comments after he left Afghanistan said on Sunday he was faced with a "hard choice" between the "armed Taliban" or "leaving the dear country that I dedicated my life to protecting the past 20 years"."The Taliban have won with the judgement of their swords and guns, and are now responsible for the honour, property and self-preservation of their countrymen," Ghani said in a statement posted to Facebook.

The quake was followed by a series of aftershocks, and Tropical Storm Grace is forecast to hit the crisis-prone nation on Monday.The quake hit 7.5 miles northeast of the town of Saint-Luis du Sud on the country’s southwestern Tiburon Peninsula.Prime Minister Ariel Henry declared a state of emergency, and pledged to “mobilize all the resources of my administration to help victims.”The quake and the aftershocks damaged churches, hotels, hospitals and homes. It also caused a large landslide that blocked the main road from Les Cayes to Jeremie on the southwestern tip of the island. The nation was still in shock following the July 7 assassination of President Jovenel Moise.Also watch: Massive earthquake hits Haiti, thousands dead & trapped under rubble; US, Mexico send aidThe tremor took place on the same fault line that caused the devastating 2010 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.“Today’s earthquake is yet another setback for Haiti on top of political instability and worsening violence, Covid-19 and rising food insecurity,” Cara Buck, the acting Haiti director of the aid agency Mercy Corps, said in a statement from Port-au-Prince.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/haiti-earthquake-death-toll-inches-towards-1-300-us-sends-search-teams-101629070209504.html
16-08-2021||World||Pentagon to send 1,000 troops to help in evacuation||The Pentagon authorized another 1,000 troops to help evacuate US citizens and Afghans who worked for them from Kabul, a US official said on Sunday, after the embassy warned the security situation at the city's airport was changing quickly.The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the addition brings the total number of troops in Afghanistan temporarily to 6,000. The soldiers would come from the 82nd Airborne Division, which had been on standby.Residents reported sporadic gunfire in the area of the Hamid Karzai International Airport, the main point of evacuations out of Afghanistan, as US troops aided the departure of US personnel after the Taliban entered the Afghan capital."There are reports of the airport taking fire; therefore we are instructing US citizens to shelter in place," the U.S. embassy said in a security alert.Two sources familiar with the situation at the airport could not confirm the reports of firing there, amid an exodus of Americans, their local allies and other foreigners.Secretary of State Antony Blinken had said earlier on Sunday that US embassy staff were ferried by helicopter from the diplomatic compound to the airport, about 5 km (3 miles) away on the northeastern side of the city."We're working to make sure that our personnel are safe and secure. We're relocating the men and women of our embassy to a location at the airport," Blinken told ABC news.Asked if the evacuation was evocative of the US departure from Vietnam in 1975, he said: "Let's take a step back. This is manifestly not Saigon."President Ashraf Ghani confirmed he has left the country, leaving it unclear how power would be transferred following the sweep across Afghanistan that brought the Taliban back to the capital two decades after it was overthrown by US-led forces.Sources told Reuters that most US staff were expected to be evacuated from Kabul in the coming day or two.A NATO official said all commercial flights had been suspended and only military aircraft were allowed to operate. The alliance said it was helping to keep the airport running.France and Germany, members of NATO, said on Sunday they were moving their diplomats to the airport and sending military transport planes to Kabul to evacuate their citizens and their Afghan helpers.'NOT SAIGON'A U.S. intelligence assessment earlier in the week had said Kabul could be encircled in 30 days and could fall to the Taliban within 90 days, but the insurgents captured most of Afghanistan's major cities in less than a week and entered the capital on Sunday.Some 4,200 people remained in the US embassy until Thursday, when the Taliban's rapid gains forced the Biden administration to begin flying in thousands of troops to help pull out many of the remaining diplomats.The deployment included an additional 1,000 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division, who President Joe Biden said on Saturday would help evacuate citizens and ensure an "orderly and safe" drawdown of U.S. military personnel.On Sunday, U.S. officials said they were weighing whether more troops were needed. Another 3,000 are on standby in Kuwait.Washington invested billions of dollars over four U.S. administrations in Afghan government forces, giving them advantages over the Taliban, but they were unable to defend the country in the face of the militants' advance, Blinken told CNN.The United States' original mission in Afghanistan, launched to oust al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, had been fulfilled, Blinken said, saying Washington had prevented further attacks by militants harbored by the Taliban.But Biden has faced rising domestic criticism after sticking to the plan to withdraw, which was agreed under his Republican predecessor Donald Trump. On Saturday, Biden defended his decision, saying an "endless American presence in the middle of another country's civil conflict was not acceptable to me".Republican lawmaker Michael McCaul said a Taliban takeover would revive the threat to the United States."We are going to go back to a pre-9/11 state. A breeding ground for terrorism," he told CNN on Sunday.Biden met with his national security team on Sunday by secure videoconference from the presidential retreat at Camp David to hear updates on evacuations and the security situation, a White House official said.US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat like Biden, said at a news conference that the safety of U.S. personnel and of Afghans who supported the Americans should be Washington's top concern."Job number one is for us to bring back, first, all American personnel ... But second, all of the brave Afghans who helped our military, they have to be provided an exit to come to America," Schumer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-to-send-1-000-troops-to-help-in-evacuation-101629066460804.html
16-08-2021||World||Won with the judgment of their swords, guns: Ghani flees as Taliban take Kabul||Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said Sunday after fleeing the country that the Taliban had won, as the militants entered Kabul -- nearly 20 years after they were ousted from power by a US-led invasion.Ghani left as the insurgents closed in on the capital, before ultimately entering the city and taking over the presidential palace, sealing a nationwide military victory in just 10 days.The Taliban have carried out a lightning sweep of the country, with government forces collapsing without the support of the US military, which is finalising its withdrawal in alignment with an August 31 deadline set by President Joe Biden.The insurgents' imminent takeover triggered fear and panic in Kabul among residents fearful of the group's hardline brand of Islam, which it imposed during its 1996-2001 rule."The Taliban have won with the judgement of their swords and guns, and are now responsible for the honour, property and self-preservation of their countrymen," Ghani said in a statement posted to Facebook, his first since fleeing."They are now facing a new historical test. Either they will preserve the name and honour of Afghanistan or they will give priority to other places and networks," he added, saying he left to prevent a "flood of bloodshed".Ghani did not say where he had travelled to, but leading Afghan media group Tolo news suggested he had gone to Tajikistan.'Ensure security'After initially ordering fighters not to enter the capital, a Taliban spokesman confirmed the Islamist insurgents had entered several districts in Kabul to "ensure security."Three senior Taliban sources also told AFP that their fighters had taken control of the presidential palace and were holding a meeting on security in the capital.Fighters inside the palace said they had been "victorious," in footage aired on Al-Jazeera."The former Afghan president has left the nation, leaving the people to this situation," Abdullah Abdullah, who heads the peace process, said in a video on his Facebook page.Ghani's departure from office was one of the key demands of the Taliban in months of peace talks with the government, but he had stubbornly clung to power.The insurgents said they want a "peaceful transfer" within the next few days.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged the Taliban and all parties to "exercise restraint" and said that the rights of women and girls, who suffered under the previous Taliban regime, be protected.The UN also said the Security Council would meet over Afghanistan on Monday.Mass evacuation effortThere are fears of a security vacuum in Kabul as thousands of police and other armed services members have abandoned their posts, uniforms, and even weapons.The United States began moving its citizens and Afghan staff to Kabul airport, with the help of thousands of troops deployed to the capital to assist with the evacuation.A US defense official said several hundred embassy employees had already been evacuated from Afghanistan, and that the airport remained open to commercial flights.The US embassy said there had been "reports of the airport taking fire" but those were not immediately confirmed.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the Western alliance was working to keep the airport running "to facilitate and coordinate evacuations", as foreign nationals and Afghans converged on the facility to attempt to leave the country.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken nevertheless dismissed comparisons with the chaotic American departure from Saigon in 1975."The fact of the matter is this: We went to Afghanistan 20 years ago with one mission in mind," he said Sunday."That was to deal with the people that attacked us on 9/11. That mission has been successful."More US troopsThe scale and speed of the insurgents' advance have shocked Afghans and the US-led alliance that poured billions into the country over the past two decades.President Joe Biden ordered the deployment of an additional 1,000 US troops to help secure the evacuation of embassy employees and thousands of Afghans who worked for American forces and now fear Taliban reprisals.That brought the total expected in Kabul in the coming days to 6,000.Biden's decision to stick to his withdrawal timetable has come under increased scrutiny given the collapse of the Afghan armed forces, but he insisted there was no choice and he would not "pass this war" onto another president.IsolatedGhani's government was left completely isolated on Sunday after the insurgents overran the anti-Taliban northern stronghold of Mazar-i-Sharif and the eastern city of Jalalabad.Like with most of the other captured cities, the seizure of power came after government forces surrendered or retreated.Videos posted on pro-Taliban social media accounts showed the group's heavily armed fighters in cities across the country, waving white flags and greeting locals.In Kabul, many resident were already resigned to the Taliban taking power."My only wish is that their return leads to peace. That is all we want," said Kabul shopkeeper Tariq Nezami.For the tens of thousands who have sought refuge in Kabul in recent weeks, the overwhelming mood was one of apprehension and fear."I am worried there will be a lot of fighting here," one doctor who arrived with his 35-strong family from Kunduz told AFP, asking not to be named."I would rather return home, where I know it has stopped."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/won-with-the-judgment-of-their-swords-guns-ghani-flees-as-taliban-take-kabul-101629065858093.html
16-08-2021||World||Commercial flights suspended from Kabul airport||Afghanistan’s embattled president left the country Sunday, joining thousands of his fellow citizens and foreigners in a stampede fleeing the advancing Taliban and signaling the end of a 20-year Western experiment aimed at remaking the country.The Taliban fanned out across the capital, and an official with the militant group said it would soon announce the creation of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan from the presidential palace in Kabul. That was the name of the country under Taliban rule before the militants were ousted by U.S.-led forces after the 9/11 attacks. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media.The Al-Jazeera news network later aired footage showing a group of Taliban fighters inside the presidential palace.The city was gripped by panic, with helicopters racing overhead throughout the day to evacuate personnel from the US Embassy. Smoke rose near the compound as staff destroyed important documents, and the American flag was lowered. Several other Western missions also prepared to pull their people out.Afghans fearing that the Taliban could reimpose the kind of brutal rule that all but eliminated women’s rights rushed to leave the country, lining up at cash machines to withdraw their life savings. The desperately poor — who had left homes in the countryside for the presumed safety of the capital — remained in parks and open spaces throughout the city.Though the Taliban had promised a peaceful transition, the US Embassy suspended operations and warned Americans late in the day to shelter in place and not try to get to the airport.Commercial flights were suspended after sporadic gunfire erupted at the airport, according to two senior US military officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations. Evacuations continued on military flights, but the halt to commercial traffic closed off one of the last routes available for Afghans fleeing the country.Still, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken rejected comparisons to the US pullout from Vietnam, as many watched in disbelief at the sight of helicopters landing in the embassy compound to take diplomats to a new outpost at Kabul International Airport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/commercial-flights-suspended-from-kabul-airport-101629054363217.html
16-08-2021||World||Explained: What does Taliban mean? Who are their leaders and what do they want?||With the second- and third-largest cities of Afghanistan having fallen to the Taliban in the last 24 hours, the control of insurgents over the war-torn country looks imminent even as the international community has asserted that they won’t recognise any government imposed by military force.The Taliban, which was ousted by US forces in 2001, now controls over half of the provincial capitals and is gradually encircling Afghanistan’s national capital Kabul, a city whose fall will signal a complete control of the Islamist fundamentalist group over the country. In their latest blitz, the Taliban fighters have reportedly taken control of Logar province, which is about 80 kilometres away from the capital.Amid deteriorating situation, the United States and Britain are deploying thousands of troops, only to evacuate their citizens before Washington officially declares the end of its two-decades-long war. The Indian mission in Kabul has also issued separate security advisories over the past few weeks, urging its citizens to leave Afghanistan as soon as possible on the earliest available commercial flight options.The United States has expressed concerns that the hardline Islamist group could topple the Ashraf Ghani-led government within three months, according to a US media report, which would see the return of the Taliban at the helm after nearly two decades.Also Read | Taliban near gates of Kabul as embassies prepare for evacuationsWho are the Taliban?In 1994, Mullah Mohammad Omar founded the Taliban with dozens of followers to challenge the rampant crime and corruption during the civil war. Taliban literally means “students” in Pashto, a reference to the founding members being the students of Mullah Mohammad Omar.The group originally drew members from the so-called “mujahideen” fighters who pushed the erstwhile USSR forces out of Afghanistan in the 1980s. It then went on to take control of most parts of the country by 1996 and ruled for about five years until the group was uprooted by the US forces in 2001. Mullah Mohammad Omar went into hiding after US-backed forces toppled the group.The hardline Islamist movement has since been fighting against the Western troops to regain control of Afghanistan.Who are the main leaders of the Taliban?Haibatullah Akhundzada, the Islamic legal scholar, is the Taliban's supreme leader who holds final authority over the group's political, religious, and military affairs, according to news agency Reuters. He took over the leadership after his predecessor, Akhtar Mansour, was killed in a US drone strike near the Afghan-Pakistan border in 2016.Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar heads the political office of the Taliban and is part of the team negotiating for a political settlement with various stakeholders in Doha. While the Afghan government has reportedly offered a deal to end violence in Afghanistan, Baradar is yet to respond as the Taliban continues its offensive back home.Believed to be in his early 30s, Mullah Omar’ son Yaqoob oversees the military operations of the Taliban. Yaqoob was seen as a successor of Mansour but he himself proposed the name of Akhundzada because of his young age and lack of experience in the battlefield, reported Reuters citing a Taliban commander.Also Read | Kabul in Taliban’s cross-hairs make Doha peace talks redundantWhat do they want?The Taliban, which grew in popularity in its initial days because of its promise to curb crime and corruption, later became notorious for brutally imposing their harsh version of Sharia. The girls and women of Afghanistan particularly bore the brunt of the Taliban regime, which banned them from schools and workplaces. Reports suggest that the group has resorted to its old tactics of oppressing women in the name of a “genuine Islamic system.” The Taliban has again promised to restore peace and security to its followers while hundreds of thousands of civilians get displaced fearing persecution.So, what happens now?According to an analysis published in The Washington Post, the Taliban tactics suggest their interest in seizing border crossing and contested territories during its previous rule. “Taking control of these areas might enable the Taliban to repress its political opponents while generating tens of millions in revenue before the end of the year,” the report says, indicating the group taking the control back from the elected Afghan government in coming days.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-does-taliban-mean-who-are-their-leaders-and-what-do-they-want-101628873902226.html
