In an opinion piece in The Australian newspaper, Abbott said the “answer to almost every question about China is India.” “With the world’s other emerging superpower becoming more belligerent almost by the day, it’s in everyone’s interests that India take its rightful place among the nations as quickly as possible,” Abbott, who visited India last week, wrote.“Because trade deals are about politics as much as economics, a swift deal between India and Australia would be an important sign of the democratic world’s tilt away from China, as well as boosting the long-term prosperity of both our countries,” he added.Also read | Australian trade envoy Tony Abbott meets PM Modi, bilateral trade ties on agendaAs Australia's prime minister, Abbott oversaw a bilateral free trade deal with China, which took effect in 2015 and also hosted a state visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping a year before that. However, after Australia banned Chinese telecom giant Huawei from major communications infrastructure projects and called for an independent probe into the origins of the coronavirus, ties between Beijing and Canberra have soured.Abbott, also a former prime minister, stressed that Australia needed drastically to move away from Beijing and argued that India was a “natural partner” to his country. “India and Australia are like-minded democracies whose relationship had been underdeveloped, at least until Narendra Modi became India’s prime minister,” he said.Also read | China suspends ‘economic dialogue mechanism’ with Australia"India and Australia are like-minded democracies whose relationship had been under-developed, at least until Narendra Modi became India's Prime Minister. Under Modi, India has revived the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, and the first in-person Quad summit is expected before the end of the year," he said."Under Modi, India has invited Australia to join the annual Malabar naval exercises that will soon involve India, the United States, Japan, Australia and also the United Kingdom's visiting carrier strike group led by the Royal Navy's new flagship HMS Queen Elizabeth. It will be an impressive show of strength, demonstrating the democracies' commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific," he added.India, Abbott pointed out, is Australia's seventh-biggest trade partner with an annual trade turnover of about $30 billion and said that despite being hampered by tariffs and mutual perceptions that neither country is always a good place to do business. He also said the problem is that China's “daunting power is a consequence of the free world's decision to invite a communist dictatorship into global trading networks.”Also read | Australia cancels belt and road deals; China warns of further damage to ties“China has exploited the West’s goodwill and wishful thinking to steal our technology and undercut our industries; and, in the process, become a much more powerful competitor than the old Soviet Union ever was, because it’s now a first-rate economy that’s rapidly developing a military to match; and spoiling for a fight over Taiwan, a pluralist democracy of 25 million that’s living proof there’s no totalitarian gene in the Chinese DNA,” Abbott added.Abbott met PM Modi last Thursday and discussed ways to further strengthen bilateral trade, investment and economic cooperation to realise the full potential of the India-Australia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, according to a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). They emphasised that enhanced economic cooperation between India and Australia would help the two countries in realising their shared vision of a stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/-answer-to-almost-every-question-about-china-is-india-australia-s-tony-abbott-101628528582343.html

India, as the UNSC president this month, noted the threats to maritime safety and security and called upon the members to consider implementing the 2000 UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.External affairs minister S Jaishankar later thanked all members for “supporting the first signature event of Indian Presidency” after the statement on maritime security was unanimously adopted by UNSC. “Ten non Council members sent their written position underlining that the debate was timely and relevant. PM articulated five key maritime principles- on trade, disputes, natural disasters, environment and connectivity,” Jaishankar tweeted.Also read | PM Modi lays roadmap for maritime security cooperation at UNSCPrime Minister Modi called for a “framework of mutual understanding and cooperation” on maritime security as he outlined five principles, including the settling of maritime disputes peacefully and in accordance with international laws. Among the four other principles proposed by PM Modi as chair of a high-level debate were freed maritime trade, jointly fighting maritime threats from natural disasters and non-state actors, preservation of the maritime environment and promoting “responsible maritime connectivity”.#IndiainUNSC✅Adopted👉🏻Presidential Statement on Maritime Security adopted by the #UNSC🔹An important recognition of the importance of maritime security by the UNSC🔹A call for international cooperation. pic.twitter.com/AeZDyF8vVyModi is the first Indian prime minister to preside over a UNSC open debate focussed on ways to effectively counter maritime crime and strengthen coordination in the domain. The meeting was attended by several heads of state and government of member states of the UNSC, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and US secretary of state Antony Blinken. The UNSC for the first time discussed maritime security as an exclusive agenda item in such a high-level open debate.Also read | At UNSC, India’s values and interests convergeAfter Modi’s address, Putin suggested the creation of a maritime security body in the UNSC to address maritime crimes, piracy and maritime terrorism and vowed his country will ensure security in the Persian Gulf and the Atlantic Ocean amid a surge across the globe in piracy-related incidents. "Unfortunately, there are also many threats along sea routes. And that is why it is so important that today we are considering substantive, practical issues related to the fight against piracy of the 21st century, meaning to establish a more effective counteraction to transnational crime and prevent the use of seas and oceans for criminal purposes", Sputnik quoted the Russian president as saying.Speaking at the debate, Blinken thanked India for its leadership and bringing all the countries together for a discussion on maritime security and for “India's leadership on these issues,” especially in the Indo-Pacific. "That's why I'm grateful for India's leadership in bringing us together today and calling on all nations to recommit to defending and strengthening the maritime rules and principles that we forge together and committed to uphold,” Blinken said, according to PTI.Monday’s virtual high-level open debate on maritime security is one of the three signature events of India’s current presidency of the powerful 15-nation UN body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unsc-adopts-first-ever-statement-on-maritime-security-under-india-s-presidency-101628525911290.html
09-08-2021||World||Modi calls for UN ‘framework’ on maritime security||Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday called for a “framework of mutual understanding and cooperation” on maritime security based on five principles that include the settling of maritime disputes “peacefully and in accordance with international laws”, which is something that China has disregarded in furthering its claims in the South China Sea.Freed maritime trade, jointly fighting maritime threats from natural disasters and non-state actors such as pirates, preservation of maritime environment and promoting “responsible maritime connectivity” were the other four “basic principles” proposed by the prime minister as chair of a high-level debate on ‘Enhancing Maritime Security - A Case for International Cooperation’.The UN Security Council adopted India’s presidential statement on maritime security.Modi became on Monday the first Indian prime minister to chair, although virtually, a high-level debate of the UN Security Council, using its month-long rotational presidency for August. The debate was attended by several heads of state and government such as Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Vietnam’s Pham Minh Chinh, and Democratic Republic of Congo’s Felix Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo, who is also president of the African Union, and US secretary of state Antony Blinken.India hosted the maritime security debate as a signature event, with two more later in the month that will be focused on UN peacekeeping and counter-terrorism.OCEANS: LIFELINE OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE“Oceans are our shared global commons, they are also the lifeline of international trade. Above all, they are key to our planet’s future,” the prime minister said in Hindi as translated into English by an official interpreter. “However, today this common heritage of ours faces various types of threats. Maritime routes are being misused for piracy and terrorism. There are maritime disputes between countries. And climate change and natural disasters are also challenges to our maritime domain.”In this context, Modi added, “We need a framework for mutual understanding and cooperation in order to conserve and utilise our shared maritime heritage. Such a framework cannot be created by any country alone. It requires a joint effort by all of us.”Laying out the five “basic principles”, Prime Minister Modi recalled in details India’s own role in observing and promoting them, going back to the Harappan civilisation whose Lothal port had extensive maritime trade linkages to other contemporary civilisations and he underscored the freedom of these routes that allowed Buddha’s preachings to spread around the world. “Free maritime trade has always been part of the civilisational ethos of India,” he said.SETTLING MARITIME DISPUTES PEACEFULLYOn the principle of settling maritime disputes peacefully and in accordance with international law, the prime minister spoke, once again, India’s own efforts in this regard and cited the resolution of its own differences with Bangladesh. “This is extremely important for promoting mutual trust and confidence and ensuring global peace and stability.”The prime minister did not mention China, which has shown itself to be most prolific violator of maritime laws in settling disputes and furthering claims, such as in the South China Sea.Blinken, the US secretary of state, did not hold his punches though. He spoke forcefully on ongoing disputes and claims and counterclaims in the South China Sea, without naming China, which is at the heart of them all. “When a state faces no consequences for ignoring these rules, he said, referring to South China Sea actions without naming China, “it fuels greater impunity and instability everywhere”.China’s deputy permanent representative Dai Bing pushed back later, says the Security Council was not the right forum for discussing South China Sea and attacked the United States as “unqualified to make irresponsible remarks on the”. “The United States has been stirring up trouble out of nothing.”The need for action on maritime security was echoed, however, by all participants in the debate. President Putin, who spoke after Modi, proposed “establishing a special structure within the UN system that would directly deal with the issue of fighting maritime crime in various regions”. He added that the structure “should be based on the support of the UN member states, and actively engage experts, representatives of civil society, academia, and private sector”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/modi-calls-for-un-framework-on-maritime-security-101628522476276.html

UK high court Judge Martin Chamberlain ruled that an appeal looking at the consequences to Nirav Modi’s state of mind is “reasonably arguable”. In June, the UK high court turned down Nirav Modi’s appeal against his extradition to India.The Westminster Magistrates’ Court cleared Nirav Modi’s extradition in February this year and found him guilty of fraud and money laundering in the PNB fraud. The court also dismissed his claims that he wouldn’t get a fair trial in India. UK home secretary Priti Patel approved the extradition in April.Nirav Modi then approached the UK high court to ascertain if there were any grounds for an appeal against Patel’s decision or the Westminster Magistrates’ Court order. Modi’s appeal was rejected by a high court judge.According to ANI, Nirav Modi's lawyer in an application to the UK high court last month to appeal against his extradition said it would seriously impact his mental health and would worsen "suicidal feelings". Edward Fitzgerald said Modi was "severely depressed" and asked that the extradition be blocked on mental health grounds, the news agency added.Also read | 'Will continue to make all efforts to bring back fugitives': MEAFitzgerald said in the application that Modi's mental health and suicidal feelings would worsen if he were to land in Mumbai’s "Covid-rich" Arthur Road Jail.

09-08-2021||World||Pakistan again claims no evidence Afghan envoy’s daughter was abducted||Pakistan has reiterated its contention that there is no evidence the Afghan envoy’s daughter was abducted and assaulted in Islamabad, an incident that took ties between the two countries to a new low. Selsela Alikhil, the 26-year-old daughter of Afghan ambassador Najibullah Alikhil, was abducted, held for almost five hours and assaulted by unidentified men in Islamabad on July 16. Two days later, the Afghan government recalled its envoy and senior diplomats from Islamabad and closed its embassy over security concerns. When a delegation from Afghanistan visited Islamabad to conduct its own inquiries into the incident and to assess the safety of Afghan officials, the Pakistani side informed the team that “findings on the ground did not corroborate the report by” the envoy’s daughter. The development comes at a time when Kabul has accused Islamabad of failing to prevent some 10,000 foreign fighters from groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) sneaking into Afghanistan to fight alongside the Taliban. Afghan leaders have also said Pakistan hasn’t done enough to push the Taliban to join negotiations to find a political settlement. Also Read | Cong leader demands immediate evacuation of Sikhs, Hindus from AfghanistanThe Afghan delegation met officials from Pakistan’s law enforcement agencies and foreign ministry. The delegation was given a briefing on all aspects of the investigation conducted by Pakistani authorities and shown video footage from “various locations of different timings in which [the envoy’s daughter] was clearly identifiable moving around the places independently”, Pakistan’s Foreign Office said in a statement. The Afghan delegation was also taken to all the sites visited by the envoy’s daughter and given a presentation of technical data such as mobile data. “The delegation was conveyed that law enforcement agencies had carried out detailed and thorough investigation in the complaint and a comprehensive witness account led to the conclusion that the findings on the ground did not corroborate the report by the complainant. This was further substantiated by the technical evidence,” the statement said. Pakistani authorities reiterated an earlier request for additional information and access to evidence and Selsela Alikhil. The Afghan delegation was informed about measures taken to enhance the security of the Afghan embassy in Islamabad and consulates in other cities. “At this critical juncture in the Afghan peace process, it is extremely important to work jointly for the shared objective of a peaceful, stable and prosperous Afghanistan. Pakistan hopes that the embassy of Afghanistan in Islamabad would soon resume its normal operations,” the statement said. Afghanistan had also expressed deep concern over Pakistan interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed’s claims that there was no evidence the envoy’s daughter was abducted. Ahmed had also claimed the abduction was part of a conspiracy by India’s intelligence agencies. The Afghan side had said such remarks could lead to greater mistrust between the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-again-claims-no-evidence-afghan-envoy-s-daughter-was-abducted-101628507235263.html
09-08-2021||World||International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples 2021: Theme, significance||The International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples is celebrated every year on August 9. The United Nations (UN) estimates that there are more than 476 million indigenous people in the world, spread across 90 countries and representing 5,000 different cultures, who make 6.2 per cent of the global population and live in all geographic regions.Like all International days and weeks, which are marked to educate the public on issues of concern, to mobilise political will and resources to address global problems, the International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples is also celebrated to recognise the contribution and achievements of indigenous communities and to highlight the plight they face in their existence.Significance of International Day of the World’s Indigenous PeoplesThe International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples was marked for the first time by UN General Assembly in December 1994, to commemorate the first meeting of the UN Working Group on Indigenous Populations of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights.The UN celebrates this day every year to “demand indigenous peoples’ inclusion, participation and approval in the constitution of a system with social and economic benefits for all”. Indigenous communities have also been disproportionately affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, whose life expectancy was already 20 years lower than that of their non-Indigenous counterparts before the pandemic hit.The UN has been working towards ushering in constitutional reforms at the international level to address the ill-treatment of indigenous communities and the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) by the General Assembly in September 2007, by a majority of 144 states in favour, was another step in the direction. Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States were the four nations who initially opposed the adoption but later reversed their decision to support the declaration.In 2022, the UN will start another milestone with the Decade of Indigenous Languages (2022-2032). It aims to conserve Indigenous languages, which helps preserve their cultures, world views and visions, as well as expressions of self-determination. The agency estimates that one indigenous language dies every two weeks.Theme this yearUN has decided on the theme of ‘Leaving no one behind: Indigenous peoples and the call for a new social contract’ for this year’s International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples. Defining social contract as an “unwritten agreement that societies make to cooperate for social and economic benefits”, the UN seeks to encourage societies to treat indigenous communities as stakeholders since they were not included in the initial social contract, which was formulated by dominant communities.It credits indigenous communities for fighting climate change and helping biodiversity flourish and asks nations to formulate a “new social contract” which “must be based on genuine participation and partnership that fosters equal opportunities and respects the rights, dignity and freedoms of all. Indigenous peoples’ right to participate in decision-making is a key component in achieving reconciliation between indigenous peoples and States”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-day-of-the-world-s-indigenous-peoples-2021-theme-significance-101628505363347.html

On August 9, 1945, the United States dropped the second nuclear bomb on Nagasaki, three days after Hiroshima was destroyed by the first one - a uranium bomb- 'Little Boy'.In his speech at the Nagasaki Peace Park on Monday, Nagasaki mayor Tomihisa Taue urged Japan, the United States and Russia to do more to eliminate nuclear weapons. He urged Japan to take the lead in creating a nuclear-free zone in Northeast Asia.History of Nagasaki Day:The bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki was code-named the 'Fat Man'. It killed over 80,000 people. This led to Japan's unconditional surrender in Second World War. At least 70,000 people were killed in the initial blast at Nagasaki, while approximately another 70,000 more died from radiation-related illnesses later. A US warplane named--Enola Gay dropped the 'Fat Man' about 1,650 feet above Nagasaki. This led to Japan's unconditional surrender in Second World War.Many survivors of the bombing developed cancer or other illnesses due to their exposure to radiation and suffered discrimination.Significance of Nagasaki Day:Nagasaki Day is being observed across the globe to promote peace and create awareness about the threat of nuclear weapons. This day plays an important role as it focuses on anti-war and anti-nuclear demonstrations in many countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nagasaki-day-know-its-history-and-significance-101628484169219.html

China does not classify them as confirmed cases.China's tally of infections stands at 93,826 since the outbreak began, while deaths stayed at 4,636.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-more-covid-19-cases-while-some-cities-kick-off-new-tests-101628484717258.html
09-08-2021||World||Taliban capture key cities in north Afghanistan, US deploys B-52 bombers||The Taliban are continuing with their offensive in Afghanistan, seizing more territory - this time in the northern part of the country - including the city of Kunduz. Taliban forces mostly overran the provincial capital city of Sar-e-Pul, also in the country's north, marking another loss for the government amid a series of unprecedented advances by the insurgent group.Taliban's actions have been criticised by the western powers as well as by people who are against the violence. Protests have been held in many cities across the world, in which people have sought United Nations' intervention and denounced Pakistan for supporting the insurgent group.At one such protest by Afghan citizens in Germany on Saturday, civil society activist Abdul Bari Samandar slammed Pakistan's proxy war through Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). The protest was organised as a Pakistani terrorist was arrested by Afghan commando forces in the outskirts of Ghazni provincial centre. He was involved in terrorist activities and the killing of civilians.The Taliban, meanwhile, said that all parts of the city of Kunduz were under its control, adding that it had also seized armoured vehicles, weapons and military equipment.Videos on social media showed huge amount of arms and ammunition seized by Taliban from security forces and house of Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum in Jawzjan province. One of the videos shows Taliban fighters loading guns, including AK-47, and other weapons looted from Dostum's house into a vehicle in Khawja Do Koh district.The former vice president last week returned from Turkey, where he was believed to be receiving medical treatment. Dostum has overseen one of the largest militias in the north (Northern Alliance) along with Ahmad Shah Massoud who was considered as Sher-e-Panjshir, which garnered a fearsome reputation in its fight against the Taliban in the 1990s.Heavy fighting between the Taliban and Afghan security forces in Kunduz on Saturday killed at least 11 civilians and wounded 40, according to health director, Dr Ehsanullah Fazli.Fighting in Afghanistan's long-running conflict began to intensify in May when the US and other foreign forces started the final stage of a withdrawal, which will complete by September 11.The Taliban already control large portions of the countryside and are now challenging Afghan government forces in several large cities.Meanwhile, 572 Taliban terrorists, including three Pakistani nationals affiliated to Al-Qaeda, were killed in airstrikes conducted by the Afghan Air Force at the outskirts of Lashkargah, Helmand provincial centre, on Sunday.On Friday too, as many as 30 Pakistani nationals, who were members of Al-Qaeda, were killed in airstrikes on Taliban targets in Helmand province.These airstrikes come a day after the Afghan Ambassador to the UN Ghulam Isaczai said on Friday that Afghanistan is prepared to provide the United Nations Security Council with material evidence in support of its claim that Pakistan is ensuring a supply chain to the Taliban.The United States has sent its B-52 bombers and Spectre gunships to Afghanistan to stop the advancement of Taliban insurgents. According to UK-based The Times, the bombers are flying into Afghanistan from an airbase in Qatar, hitting targets around Kandahar, Herat and Lashkar Gah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-capture-key-cities-in-north-afghanistan-us-sends-b-52-bombers-101628479888280.html
09-08-2021||World||Covid-19: Over a million students skip admissions in US; kindergarten schools see highest plunge||More than one million children in the United States did not take admission in schools, mostly due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, recent data by the government showed. The steepest drop in admission was reported in kindergarten schools, the New York Times (NYT) reported citing government figures.The NYT and Stanford University analysed the enrollment data of 70,000 government schools across 33 states. The findings show that 10,000 local public schools lost at least 20 per cent of their kindergartners in 2020. The number of affected schools has increased from 4,000 from 2019 and in 2018, according to the NYT report.Further exposing the rising disparity between the rich and poor due to the coronavirus pandemic, the data analysis showed that most of the decline in admission has occurred in the areas living below or near the poverty line, according to the NYT report. The average annual income of a family of four in these areas is ₹25 lakh or less. As per the report, there has been a 28 per cent higher decline in such areas than in the rest of the country.The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has killed 4,293,530 people worldwide. In the US alone, 616,828 people have succumbed to the viral disease, while more than 35 million people have been infected.The NYT further reported that in the Philadelphia school district, where most students are already from low-income families, elementary education admissions decreased by more than 25 per cent between 2019 and 2020. Besides Philadelphia, Jackson and Honolulu were the top cities with the highest decline in kindergarten admissionsKindergarten schools are optional in many US states, however, experts say that direct education in kindergarten is beneficial for children as in these schools the conditions affecting the physical and mental development of children like autism are usually detected.The report also attributed online education as one of the key reasons for the decline in admissions. According to the research paper, there has been a 42 per cent decline in the districts where there was complete online education.Due to the increase in the infection of the Delta mutation of coronavirus, the concern of the people has increased further, according to the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-over-a-million-students-skip-admissions-in-us-kindergarten-schools-see-highest-plunge-101628475159892.html
09-08-2021||World||Anthony Fauci says Covid boosters should go ‘soon’ to the vulnerable||Anthony Fauci, the US’s top infectious-disease doctor, said he’s “strongly in favor” of speeding booster shots to people with weakened immune systems, a further sign of how the delta variant continues to shift the strategies for curbing the pandemic.“We need to look at them in a different light,” Fauci said on CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS” on Sunday. “We will almost certainly be boosting those people before we boost the general population that’s been vaccinated, and we should be doing that reasonably soon.”Fauci spoke as debate grows over “breakthrough” infections among fully vaccinated people and whether official approval should be given for booster shots. In Israel, the first nation to roll out boosters widely, more than half a million people aged 60 and over will have their third injection by the end of Sunday.Fauci said most people who have compromised immune systems, including those with organ transplants or who are on chemotherapy, “never did get an adequate response” from their Covid-19 vaccination.Across the U.S., the delta variant has fueled a rebound to more than 100,000 new infections a day, levels last seen six months ago. While the daily average number of deaths remains far below the levels of last winter, the pressure on hospitals is mounting -- the seven-day moving average for new admissions has consistently increased since June 25, according to official data.In New York and New Jersey, urgent care chain CityMD is resuming its virtual line system and adjusting operating hours to accommodate what it calls the “recent surge in Covid-19 testing.”In San Francisco, anyone who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine can get a supplemental dose of Pfizer Inc. or Moderna Inc.’s shots at city-run sites, if they wish to do so after consulting with their doctor, according to the city’s Department of Public Health.Health officials don’t take breakthrough infections “lightly,” Fauci said. More testing is needed in order to understand the exact scope of breakthrough cases, he said on CBS’ “Meet the Press.”When asked if other groups should get booster shots, Fauci said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is ready to give a recommendation as soon as they see clear evidence to do so from the data.The CDC has been tracking various groups including the elderly, those in nursing homes and young people month by month, he said. “As soon as they see that level of durability of protection goes down, then you will see the recommendation to vaccinate those individuals.”But, he stressed: “The vaccines are still doing what you originally want them to do -- to keep you out of the hospital to prevent you from getting seriously ill.”Local MandatesFauci said he also supports vaccine mandates at local levels, such as schools and universities, after a full approval from the Food and Drug Administration on the Covid-19 vaccines.“You’re going to see the empowerment of local enterprises giving mandates,” Fauci said on NBC. “That could be colleges, universities, places of business, a whole variety, and I strongly support that.”A full approval could arrive “within the next few weeks,” Fauci added. “I hope it’s within the month of August.”Vaccines in the U.S. have so far been given under emergency-use approval -- a reason some people give for refusing to be vaccinated.He said the variant presents the additional problem that vaccinated people can also transmit the virus to someone else. That has led to the CDC revising its mask guidelines recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-says-covid-boosters-should-go-soon-to-the-vulnerable-101628469915254.html
09-08-2021||World||California's Dixie wildfire is now second-worst in state history||The monstrous Dixie Fire in northern California has grown to become the second-largest wildfire in state history, authorities said Sunday, with three people reported missing and thousands fleeing the advancing flames.As of Sunday, the fire had destroyed 463,477 acres (187,562 hectares), up from the previous day's 447,723 acres. It now covers an area larger than Los Angeles.The Dixie blaze is the largest active wildfire in the United States, but one of only 11 major wildfires in California.Over the weekend, it surpassed the 2018 Mendocino Complex Fire to make it the second-worst fire in state history."It was like driving out of a war zone that you see in a movie," Tami Kugler told AFP, sitting beside her tent at an evacuation station after fleeing the historic town of Greenville before it burned down."My neighborhood is gone -- I mean gone, gone. Everybody I care and love about that's in that neighborhood, their homes are gone," she said, adding: "I didn't have insurance."On Saturday, Governor Gavin Newsom visited the charred remains of Greenville, expressing his "deep gratitude" to the teams fighting the flames.He said authorities had to devote more resources to managing forests and preventing fires.But he added that "the dries are getting a lot drier, it is hotter than it has ever been... we need to acknowledge just straight up these are climate-induced wildfires."Climate change amplifies droughts, creating ideal conditions for wildfires to spread out of control and inflict unprecedented material and environmental damage.The Dixie blaze, which on Saturday left three firefighters injured, remained 21 percent contained Sunday, unchanged from the day before, the CalFire website reported.Crews estimate the fire, which began July 13, will not finally be extinguished for two weeks.Higher temperatures forecastWeak winds and higher humidity have provided some succor to firefighters, but they are bracing for higher temperatures expected to exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) in the coming days.Heavy smoke was making driving hazardous for fire crews in some areas, and steep trails also made access difficult.The state's eight largest wildfires have all come since December 2017. The still-blackened scars of previous fires have aided Dixie Fire crews at times, reducing available fuel.Thousands of residents have fled the area, many finding temporary housing -- even living in tents, and often unsure whether their homes have survived.At an evacuation site under smoky skies in Susanville, exhausted families sat in folding chairs beside tents and vehicles packed with belongings grabbed from their abandoned homes.The Plumas County sheriff's office said it was still searching for three people listed as missing, after two others were found over the weekend.The Dixie Fire has already destroyed about 400 structures -- gutting Greenville -- and CalFire said workers and equipment were being deployed to save homes in the small town of Crescent Mills, three miles (five kilometers) southeast of Greenville.More than 5,000 personnel are now battling the Dixie blaze.Despite repeated evacuation orders from the authorities, some residents have refused to flee, preferring to try to fight the fire on their own rather than leave their property.By late July, the number of acres burned in California was up more than 250 percent from 2020 -- itself the worst year of wildfires in the state's modern history.A long-term drought that scientists say is driven by climate change has left much of the western United States and Canada parched -- and vulnerable to explosive and highly destructive fires.A preliminary investigation has suggested the Dixie Fire was started when a tree fell on a power cable owned by regional utility Pacific Gas & Company (PG&E), a private operator that was earlier blamed for the Camp Fire in 2018, which killed 86 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/californias-dixie-wildfire-is-now-second-worst-in-state-history-101628466415921.html
09-08-2021||World||Scientists are watching for new coronavirus variants as Delta continues to spread||The continued spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spawned a Greek alphabet of variants - a naming system used by the World Health Organization to track concerning new mutations of the virus that causes Covid-19. Some have equipped the virus with better ways of infecting humans or evading vaccine protection.Scientists remain focused on Delta, now the dominant variant rising rapidly around the world, but are tracking others to see what may one day take its place.DeltaThe Delta variant first detected in India remains the most worrisome. It is striking unvaccinated populations in many countries and has proven capable of infecting a higher proportion of vaccinated people than its predecessors.The WHO classifies Delta as a variant of concern, meaning it has been shown capable of increasing transmissibility, causing more severe disease or reducing the benefit of vaccines and treatments.According to Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in San Diego, Delta's "superpower" is its transmissibility. Chinese researchers found that people infected with Delta carry 1,260 times more virus in their noses compared with the original version of the coronavirus. Some U.S. research suggests that the "viral load" in vaccinated individuals who become infected with Delta is on par with those who are unvaccinated, but more research is needed.While the original coronavirus took up to seven days to cause symptoms, Delta can cause symptoms two to three days faster, giving the immune system less time to respond and mount a defense.    Delta also appears to be mutating further, with reports emerging of a "Delta Plus" variant, a sub-lineage that carries an additional mutation that has been shown to evade immune protection.India listed Delta Plus as a variant of concern in June, but neither the US Centers For Disease Control and Prevention nor the WHO have done so yet. According to Outbreak.info, an open-source Covid-19 database, Delta Plus has been detected in at least 32 countries. Experts say it is not yet clear whether it is more dangerous.Lambda – On the wane?The Lambda variant has attracted attention as a potential new threat. But this version of the coronavirus, first identified in Peru in December, may be receding, several infectious disease experts told Reuters.The WHO classifies Lambda as a variant of interest, meaning it carries mutations suspected of causing a change in transmissibility or causing more severe disease, but it is still under investigation. Lab studies show it has mutations that resist vaccine-induced antibodies.Dr. Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California, said the percentage of new Lambda cases reported to GISAID, a database that tracks SARS-CoV-2 variants, has been dropping, a sign that the variant is waning.In a recent call with the CDC, disease experts said Lambda did not appear to be causing increased transmissibility, and vaccines appear to be holding up well against it, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who attended the discussion.B.1.621 - One to watchThe B.1.621 variant, which first arose in Colombia in January, where it caused a major outbreak, has yet to earn a Greek letter name.The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control has listed it as a variant of interest, while Public Health England describes B.1.621 as a variant under investigation. It carries several key mutations, including E484K, N501Y and D614G, that have been linked with increased transmissibility and reduced immune protection. So far, there have been 37 likely and confirmed cases in the UK, according to a recent government report, and the variant has been identified in a number of patients in Florida.More on the way?Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House's chief medical adviser, recently warned that the United States could be in trouble unless more Americans get vaccinated, as a large pool of unvaccinated people give the virus more opportunity to spread and mutate into new variants.Proponents of greater international distribution of vaccine doses by rich countries say the same thing could happen as variants emerge unchecked among the populations of poor nations where very few people have been inoculated.Even so, a key issue is that the current vaccines block severe disease but do not prevent infection, said Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccine scientist at the Mayo Clinic. That is because the virus is still capable of replicating in the nose, even among vaccinated people, who can then transmit the disease through tiny, aerosolized droplets.To defeat SARS-CoV-2, he said, will likely require a new generation of vaccines that also block transmission. Until then, the world will remain vulnerable to the rise of new coronavirus variants, according to Poland and other experts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-are-watching-for-new-coronavirus-variants-as-delta-continues-to-spread-101628465637901.html
09-08-2021||World||Covid-19: Beijing imposes travel curbs to tackle outbreak||China’s capital city on Sunday stepped up measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus cases by virtually banning people from travelling to Beijing from provinces with high Covid-19 transmission rates.Beijing has rolled out a range of measures to strengthen the management of personnel returning from the most affected regions, including imposing restrictions on their purchase of railway tickets and air services, Global Times reported.People from medium or high-risk regions or planning to return to Beijing but have a travel history related to these regions will be prevented from buying tickets for air and railway services. If they choose to drive into the Chinese capital, they will also be persuaded to make a U-turn and leave, the paper said.The Global Times report said health codes for people who are in medium and high-risk regions will be adjusted to the yellow colour, and anyone with a health code that is not green will not be allowed to board planes or trains bound for Beijing. Presenting a green health code will be a must.The Chinese mainland on Saturday reported about 150 cases from several provinces including Jiangsu, Henan, Yunnan, Hubei and Hunan, according to the National Health Commission.Top health official says US is ‘failing’ on Covid-19With the US recording its highest daily caseload in six months, a top public health official said the country is “failing”. “We shouldn’t really have ever got to the place we are,” Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, told ABC. “We are failing.” The total daily new cases have surged to 118,000, the highest since February; deaths are up 89% over the past two weeks.Tokyo, which hosted the Olympics, saw over 4,000 new cases in the past 24 hours. The daily spike in cases topped the mark for the fifth straight day.Saudi Arabia said it will begin accepting vaccinated foreign pilgrims seeking to visit the holy city of Mecca, around 18 months after a border closure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-beijing-imposes-travel-curbs-to-tackle-outbreak-101628462070524.html
