02-08-2021||World||Amid efforts to probe Covid origins, Republicans push report claiming lab leak||A preponderance of evidence proves the virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic leaked from a Chinese research facility, said a report by US Republicans released on Monday, a conclusion that US intelligence agencies have not reached.The report also cited "ample evidence" that Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) scientists - aided by US experts and Chinese and US government funds - were working to modify coronaviruses to infect humans and such manipulation could be hidden.Representative Mike McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, released the report by the panel's Republican staff. It urged a bipartisan investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic that has killed 4.4 million people worldwide. (Graphic on global cases and deaths) https://tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyiChina denies a genetically modified coronavirus leaked from the facility in Wuhan - where the first COVID-19 cases were detected in 2019 - a leading but unproven theory among some experts. Beijing also denies allegations of a cover-up.Other experts suspect the pandemic was caused by an animal virus likely transmitted to humans at a seafood market near the WIV."We now believe it's time to completely dismiss the wet market as the source," said the report. "We also believe the preponderance of the evidence proves the virus did leak from the WIV and that it did so sometime before September 12, 2019."The report cited what it called new and under-reported information about safety protocols at the lab, including a July 2019 request for a $1.5 million overhaul of a hazardous waste treatment system for the facility, which was less than two years old.In April, the top US intelligence agency said it concurred with the scientific consensus that the virus was not man-made or genetically modified.US President Joe Biden in May ordered US intelligence agencies to accelerate their hunt for the origins of the virus and report back in 90 days.A source familiar with current intelligence assessments said the US intelligence community has not reached any conclusion whether the virus came from animals or the WIV.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-efforts-to-probe-covid-origins-republicans-push-report-claiming-lab-leak-101627909054855.html
02-08-2021||World||Central China flood toll jumps to 302||The death toll from torrential rains and floods in the central Chinese province of Henan has sharply jumped to 302, local officials said on Monday, adding that at least 50 more are missing.The worst hit was capital Zhengzhou where 292 people including 14 trapped in a flooded subway carriage died, officials added. The official death toll, according to state media, was 99 as of Friday.Hou Hong, the mayor of Zhengzhou, confirmed the death toll, telling reporters that 39 people were found dead in underground car parks.The state council, China’s cabinet, announced an investigation into the floods at a press conference in the provincial capital, Zhengzhou.Henan, a province with a population of around 109 million, was battered by the heaviest rainfall in decades in July, which triggered widespread floods, deaths and economic damage.“More than 13.91 million people in 150 county-level regions have been affected by the latest round of downpours since July 16… Over 1.1 million local residents have been relocated to safer places,” Xinhua news agency reported. The floods in Henan resulted in direct economic losses of 2.25 billion yuan (US$348 million) for China’s poultry and livestock industries after 248,000 pigs and 6.4 million chickens died.The floods, described as the worst in decades saw some 15,000 farms affected, while 45,000 sheep and other large livestock died, China’s agriculture and rural affairs ministry was quoted as saying by the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.The jump in the death toll comes within days of Beijing coming down heavily on the coverage of the floods by foreign media, accusing the BBC, for one, of broadcasting “fake news” and saying the organisation was “naturally unpopular” over its flood reportage.The strong response came after the BBC called on Beijing to put a stop to the harassment of its journalists by nationalists who have accused foreign media of biased reporting.Journalists from foreign media outlets covering the floods were harassed online and by local residents, with staff from the BBC and Los Angeles Times receiving death threats, according to the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China (FCCC).“Rhetoric from organisations affiliated with China’s ruling Communist party directly endangers the physical safety of foreign journalists in China and hinders free reporting,” the FCCC said in reference to the coverage of the floods.“The FCCC is disappointed and dismayed at the growing hostility against foreign media in China, a sentiment underpinned by rising Chinese nationalism sometimes directly encouraged by Chinese officials and official entities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/central-china-flood-toll-jumps-to-302-101627905866856.html
02-08-2021||World||Indian student found dead on university campus in China||A 20-year-old Indian student was found dead under mysterious circumstances in his university room in the city of Tianjin, around 100km south of Beijing, last weekThe body of Aman Nagsen was found by the staff of Tianjin Foreign Studies University (TFSU) on Thursday.Aman Nagsen, who was enrolled for the International Business Studies course and was from Gaya in Bihar, had turned 20 in June.University authorities informed Nagsen’s family members about his death early on Friday.The cause of death is under investigation.Nagsen’s family last spoke to him on July 23 after which he did not respond to calls or messages and did not accept a money transfer via a mobile app.Last week, worried family members got in touch with Nagsen’s local guardian in Beijing who in turn got in touch with TFSU authorities, persuading them to look him up.That was when Nagsen’s body was found.“We were informed about the death of my nephew by the university at 1am in the intervening night of July 29th and 30th. After that we have not received any official communication,” the deceased’s uncle Pankaj Paswan said from Gaya.A distraught Paswan said the family has urgently requested the Indian government through the external affairs ministry to help in getting Nagsen’s body back in India. “We request both the Indian and Chinese governments to help in sending the body back to India,” he said.The 20-year-old was in good health and had no history of any major illness.Paswan added that a demonstration was organised by a group of students in Gaya to demand the quick return of Nagsen’s remains.The cause of Nagsen’s death wasn’t immediately clear though the fact that he didn’t communicate with his family for six days raises questions about the time of his demise and the circumstances leading to it.It was learnt that officials from the Indian embassy in Beijing are working on repatriating Nagsen’s remains to India and are in touch with authorities in Tianjin.An autopsy is likely to be conducted before the body is released to be taken back to India.The embassy had responded to a tweet by Bihar’s BJP chief, Sanjay Jaiswal, about the death of the student on July 30, saying it was in communication with Chinese authorities and the deceased’s family and was “providing all possible assistance”.The news of Nagsen’s death was being shared among social media groups involving Indians with links to China and many have requested the Indian embassy to urgently look into the matter.Nagsen was among the few Indian students to have remained in China following the Covid-19 outbreak here.The vast majority of around 23,000 Indian students studying here had returned to India by themselves or via evacuation flights in 2020.They have not been able to return to China because of the ban on the return of foreign students imposed by Beijing because of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-student-found-dead-on-university-campus-in-china-101627892125848.html

Addressing a virtual cabinet meeting, Ghani said on Sunday the Taliban has become "more cruel and more oppressive" in the last two decades."They have no wish for peace, for prosperity, or progress; we want peace but they want surrender (subdued people and government). They will not engage in meaningful negotiations unless the situation changes on the battlefield; therefore, we should have a clear stance. For this, there is a need for a countrywide mobilization," Ghani was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Also read | Taliban, Afghan forces clash in Herat, govt sends reinforcementsGhani's comments came as Afghan forces fought and bombed Taliban fighters and positions on Sunday as the group mounted offensives in major cities across the country. The Taliban also attacked the airport in Kandahar, the second-largest city of Afghanistan and the former stronghold of the insurgents, with at least three rockets overnight with the group's spokesperson saying that the aim was to thwart airstrikes conducted by Afghan government forces."Kandahar airport was targeted by us because the enemy was using it as a centre to conduct airstrikes against us," Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesperson, told Reuters.Authorities suspended flights out of Kandahar after the rockets hit the runway partially damaging it. The flight operations were restored later.Also watch: Afghanistan forces destroy Taliban hideouts in Kandahar airstrikeTaliban fighters have also attacked at least two other provincial capitals, including nearby Lashkar Gah in Helmand and Herat in the province of the same name. The government has said that hundreds of Taliban terrorists have been killed by the Afghanistan National Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF) across the country. At least 200 hundred Taliban terrorists were killed in an airstrike by a B-52 plane of the US air force in the Herat province.Afghanistan security forces have lead operations and counter-attacks against the Taliban in Ghazni, Kandahar, Farah, Jowzjan, Balkh, Samangan, Helmand, Takhar, Kunduz, Baghlan, Kabul and Kapisa provinces.Also read | Nearly 300 Taliban killed, hundreds injured in ops by Afghan forces in 48 hoursGhani's remarks also came on the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) said in a report that 1,677 civilians have been killed and 3,644 injured in the first six months of this year in 1,594 different security incidents. "Important to note that the total number of civilian casualties in the first six months of 2020 was 2,957, including 1,213 killed and 1,744 injured," AIHRC said in a report. "A comparison of the above mentioned figures shows that civilian casualties have increased by 80 per cent in the first six months of 2021 compared with the first six months of 2020," it added.The Taliban has captured dozens of districts, seized more land and taken control of key border crossings with neighbouring countries as US and Nato troops pull out of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistans-situation-will-change-in-6-months-says-president-ashraf-ghani-101627882698093.html
02-08-2021||World||India showcases grain power to start new role||India has begun its presidency of the UN Security Council with a generous dose of Indian grain power.T S Tirumurti, the Indian permanent representative (PR) to the UN was expected to organise on Monday a traditional breakfast that PRs of incoming presidencies host for counterparts from the rest of the 15 member nations.The menu comprises the usual fare for such breakfasts - crepes, some breads, juices, coffee and fruits. But some of Tirumurti’s guests would probably have had something already, something really Indian before heading out - oat clusters with multigrain flakes and Alphonso mango bits or crunchy millet granola bar or buttermilk millet crackers with caramelised onions, or just some Cajun trail mix in a gift hamper.“We did it to highlight the initiative taken by the Prime Minister [Narendra Modi] to declare the year 2023 the International Year of Millets, which we had successfully spearheaded in the UN General Assembly a few months ago,” said Tirumurti, who spent months on the breakfast hamper, albeit with help from his wife Gowri Tirumurti and mission colleagues.The incoming presidency’s breakfast is a UN Security Council tradition. And Tirumurti was to host it at the Permanent Indian Mission, the Charles Correa-designed aesthetic wonder amid steel-and-glass Manhattan buildings.It will then be followed by India holding the first formal business of the day in the chair - a closed door UN Security Council consultation, which will be followed by a presidential statement that Tirumurti will deliver on Darfur.Later in the day, he will brief the rest of the UN general assembly members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-unleashes-grain-power-as-it-takes-over-unsc-presidency-101627879405006.html
02-08-2021||World||Florida breaks 2020's record of Covid-19 hospitalizations as cases surge||A day after it recorded the most new daily cases since the start of the pandemic, Florida on Sunday broke a previous record for current hospitalizations set more than a year ago before vaccines were available.The Sunshine State had 10,207 people hospitalized with confirmed Covid-19 cases, according to data reported to the US Department of Health & Human Services.The previous record was from July 23, 2020, more than a half-year before vaccinations started becoming widespread, when Florida had 10,170 hospitalizations, according to the Florida Hospital Association.Florida is now leading the nation in per capita hospitalizations for Covid-19, as hospitals around the state report having to put emergency room visitors in beds in hallways and others document a noticeable drop in the age of patients.In the past week, Florida has averaged 1,525 adult hospitalizations a day, and 35 daily pediatric hospitalizations. Both are the highest per capita rate in the nation, according to Jason Salemi, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of South Florida.The hospitalizations and increasing cases have come as the new, more transmittable delta variant has spread throughout Florida, and residents have returned to pre-pandemic activities.“The recent rise is both striking and not-at-all surprising,” Salemi said in an email late Saturday.Federal health data released Saturday showed that Florida reported 21,683 new cases of Covid-19, the state’s highest one-day total since the start of the pandemic. The latest numbers were recorded on Friday and released on Saturday on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website. The figures show how quickly the number of cases is rising in the Sunshine State: only a day earlier, Florida reported 17,093 new daily cases.Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has resisted mandatory mask mandates and vaccine requirements, and along with the state Legislature, has limited local officials’ ability to impose restrictions meant to stop the spread of Covid-19. DeSantis on Friday barred school districts from requiring students to wear masks when classes resume next month.Florida's Democratic agriculture commissioner, Nikki Fried, who is seeking to run against DeSantis for governor, on Sunday urged unvaccinated Floridians to get the shots. She said she was heartened by a recent uptick in vaccinations in the state.“We are already behind the curve and in a worse spot every time the numbers come out," Fried said at a news conference in Tallahassee. “This surge is and will impact every single one of us."Throughout Florida, from Jacksonville to Miami to Tampa, hospitals have become overwhelmed.Barry Burton, the Pinellas County administrator, told the Tampa Bay Times that some local hospitals are already having to divert ambulances to different locations because of capacity concerns.There has been a startling rise in the number of children with the virus at hospitals in Miami, many of them requiring intensive care.Memorial Health’s Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital in Hollywood had seven patients with Covid-19. At Nicklaus Children’s Hospital in Miami, there were 17 patients with Covid-19 on Friday, including six in the ICU and one who needed a ventilator, Dr. Marcos Mestre, vice president and chief medical officer, told the Miami Herald.About half of the patients were under 12, Mestre said, and the rest were older and eligible for the vaccine. But none of the patients with Covid-19 at Nicklaus Children’s on Friday were vaccinated. Most children who get Covid-19 do not need hospitalization, Mestre said.In the state capital, Covid-19 hospitalizations reached 70 patients on Sunday at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare, a jump of 11 people in two days.“This is the most we’ve ever had,” Stephanie Derzypolski, a hospital spokeswoman, told the Tallahassee Democrat.The Mayo Clinic hospital in Jacksonville said it had exceeded its capacity of 304 licensed beds due to Covid-19 cases and asked the Agency for Health Care Administration for permission to operate overcapacity until the current surge ends, First Coast News in Jacksonville reported Sunday.At the UF Health North hospital emergency room in Jacksonville, Covid-19 patients once again were being put in beds in hallways due to a surge in visits.For many hospital workers, up until a month ago, it looked like there was light at the end of the tunnel, as people got vaccinated and hospitalizations decreased. But then the summer surge, powered by the new delta variant, hit Florida in July.“That light did turn out to be a train in this case,” Marsha Tittle, a nursing manager at UF Health North, told The Florida Times Union. “We’re taking more patients than we normally would take. ... My staff is wonderful. You walk out there, they’re going to have smiles on their faces and they’re doing a great job. But there’s a sense of defeat, like they’re just defeated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/florida-breaks-2020-s-record-of-covid-19-hospitalizations-as-cases-surge-101627874958512.html
02-08-2021||World||Malaysian opposition MPs march to Parliament, demand PM Yassin's resignation||Malaysian opposition lawmakers marched toward the parliament building in Kuala Lumpur to demand Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin’s resignation on Monday, after officials postponed the day’s sitting indefinitely to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in the house.With the main road cordoned off, opposition lawmakers began assembling by a field about a mile away before they walked to the building chanting “Step down, Muhyiddin” and “Muhyiddin is a coward.” Security was beefed up in the hours ahead of the gathering, with police in riot gear and increased roadblocks at the main entrances to the building.“We are gathered here to say that, in terms of the numbers of MPs, Muhyiddin’s government has fallen today,” opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim said. He said some parties had come up with a list requesting to leave the government line-up. “Hence, with the 107 here today, plus them, the government has collapsed.” Anwar later called for the gathering to disperse after police blocked them from entering the building.Malaysia’s parliament sat for the first time this year last week, but was suspended again shortly after the king on Thursday publicly rebuked a government minister for misleading the house on the status of emergency laws. Health-Director General on Sunday said the building was at high-risk of a spread in infections after the discovery of positive cases last week.The opposition, which has filed a motion of no-confidence against Muhyiddin, said the Covid risk is an “excuse” to adjourn Monday’s sitting. Health groups have said parliament can still function if virus protocols are followed.The five-day session that was initially scheduled to end today was meant to provide lawmakers a chance to grill Muhyiddin over his government’s handling of the pandemic. Public anger against him has risen as new Covid cases have more than tripled to a record since the emergency was imposed in January.Hundreds of protesters, largely dressed in black, gathered in the capital Kuala Lumpur on Saturday calling for the resignation of Muhyiddin, a full parliamentary session and an automatic loan moratorium for all.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysian-opposition-mps-march-to-parliament-demand-pm-yassin-s-resignation-101627875408743.html
