The Islamist extremist group Taliban have reportedly captured more than ten provincial capitals till now, and are strengthening their march towards the capital city, Kabul.Speaking to journalists, Danish foreign minister Jeppe Kofod said, “We have decided to temporarily close our embassy in Kabul.”Later, Norway’s foreign minister Ine Soreide confirmed that the country would also shut down its embassy and evacuate Norwegian diplomats, local employees and their close relatives.Kofod told media persons that the evacuation will be done “closely coordinated” with Norway, with which the country shares a compound.Meanwhile, France’s foreign ministry has once again asked French citizens to leave Afghanistan as soon as possible. “In light of the deteriorating security situation, we again called on French citizens last week to leave the country as soon as possible,” a statement said.Also Read | India preps for rapid evacuation of nationals in Afghanistan amid Taliban blitzThe recent developments come after the US President Joe Biden declared on April 14 that the country will withdraw its troops from Afghanistan after two decades starting May 1. Until now, an estimated 65 per cent of the Afghan territory, with many nearby towns of Kabul, have fallen into the Taliban forces. As many as 15 provincial capitals of Afghanistan has been captured by Taliban.Although peace talks had occurred in Qatar between the negotiators representing the Afghan government led by President Ashraf Ghani and the Taliban fighters for a power-sharing dead, the same has reportedly hit dead end as the latter has continued with its atrocities against security forces.On Thursday, the US embassy in Kabul said that they’ve heard of reports about Taliban executing surrendering Afghan troops. “The Taliban’s statements in Doha do not resemble their actions in Badakhshan, Ghazni, Helmand & Kandahar. Attempts to monopolise power through violence, fear, and war will only lead to international isolation,” tweeted Ross Wilson, Chargé d'Affaires to Afghanistan.Also Read | Taliban ban Covid jab in Paktia, claims report; Video shows them partying after fall of JowzjanThe US pointed out that such acts could define “war crimes” and also urged the extremist group not to wipe out Afghanistan’s “human rights gains” of the last two decades.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/denmark-norway-to-shut-down-embassies-in-afghanistan-amid-taliban-terror-101628877209716.html

Only those already vaccinated against, or recovered from Covid-19, will be allowed to cross.Trade will also be expanded through the Kerem Shalom crossing in the south of Gaza, including equipment and goods for humanitarian infrastructure, such as water and sewage.An 11-day conflict in May between Israel’s army and Hamas fighters killed at least 243 people in Gaza and 12 people in Israel. The World Bank estimated the impoverished strip would require as much as $485 million in aid over two years to recover from the fighting, including for repairs to damaged infrastructure and reinstating essential services. More than 60% of Gazans were “food insecure,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-to-open-gaza-crossing-for-first-time-since-covid-19-outbreak-101628876292679.html
13-08-2021||World||India preps for rapid evacuation of nationals in Afghanistan amid Taliban blitz||India is prepared for all contingencies in Afghanistan, including the rapid evacuation of its officials and nationals, against the backdrop of a Taliban blitz over the past week that has seen the capture of five provincial capitals since Thursday. Elaborate plans have been prepared for the speedy withdrawal of diplomats from the embassy in Kabul and a dwindling number of Indian nationals, most of them workers engaged in development projects in Afghanistan, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. These plans include putting heavy lift aircraft of the Indian Air Force on standby round the clock, the people said. These efforts have gained urgency following reports that the US is deploying 3,000 troops to Kabul and the UK sending 600 troops to provide security for the evacuation of nationals of the two countries. India has also received requests from several international organisations, among them media outlets and rights organisations, seeking help for the possible evacuation of their personnel from Afghanistan, the people cited above said. According to information provided by the government in Parliament last week, there were 1,500 Indian nationals in Afghanistan. The people said this figure had now come down to few hundreds, including diplomats and the large security contingent at the embassy in Kabul. Another concern for Indian authorities were Indian nationals who haven’t heeded the latest security advisories calling on them to immediately return home. The latest alert issued by the Indian mission on Thursday highlighted the case of three engineers who remained at a project site in an area not controlled by Afghan forces and required an “emergency air rescue”. Among the five provincial capitals captured by the Taliban since Thursday was Pul-e-Alam, the capital of Logar, which put the group’s fighters just 70 km south of Kabul. While a recent estimate by US security agencies had stated that the Taliban could take Kabul within 30 days, the latest reports suggest the Taliban could tighten their grip on areas around the capital and march towards the city within days. Among the provincial capitals captured by the Taliban since August 6 are Zaranj, Sheberghan, Sar-e-Pul, Kunduz, Taloqan, Aybak, Pul-e-Khumri, Faizabad, Ghazni, Herat, Kandahar, Qala-e-Naw, Lashkargah, Pul-e-Alam, Tarinkot, Qalat and Firozkoh. While the fall of provincial capitals in sparsely populated regions in the north were initially attributed to the Afghan government’s new security policy focused on larger and more populated urban centres, the rapid fall of Kandahar and Herat, Afghanistan’s second and third largest cities, dramatically altered the ground situation. The capture of Ghazni also cut the highway between Kabul and southern Kandahar. Despite the Taliban being emboldened by the US drawdown and showing little inclination to return to the negotiating table, India and other countries are continuing with efforts to press for a political settlement and an immediate truce. On Thursday, India joined Germany, Qatar and Turkey in calling for an immediate ceasefire in Afghanistan and asserting that any government imposed by military force in Kabul would not be recognised. A statement issued by Qatar following a meeting of special envoys and representatives of India, Germany, Norway, Qatar, Tajikistan, Turkey and Turkmenistan in Doha also highlighted the urgent need to accelerate the process to find a negotiated settlement. The statement said two separate meetings on Afghanistan – one joined by the representatives of China, Uzbekistan, the US, Pakistan, the UK, Qatar, the UN and the European Union on August 10, and the other held on August 12 – had agreed that the participants “will not recognize any government in Afghanistan that is imposed through the use of military force”. The countries also agreed on the need to accelerate the Afghan peace process as a “very urgent and essential issue for negotiating concrete proposals from both sides”. The participants urged the Taliban and the Afghan government to “build trust and accelerate efforts to reach a political settlement and comprehensive ceasefire as quickly as possible”, and to stop “violence and attacks immediately in and against provincial capitals and other cities”. The meetings expressed “grave concerns” about reports from across Afghanistan regarding violence, high civilian casualties, extra-judicial killings, widespread and credible allegations of human rights violations, and the destruction of physical infrastructure that make reconciliation efforts more difficult. As part of desperate efforts to counter the Taliban’s advance, UN Security Council members Estonia and Norway drafted a statement to condemn the group’s attacks on cities and towns resulting in high civilian casualties. According to Reuters, the draft statement, which has to be agreed by consensus by the 15-member body, threatens sanctions for abuses and acts that risk Afghanistan’s peace and stability. The text also “strongly affirms that the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is not recognized at the United Nations and declares that it does not and will not support the establishment of any government in Afghanistan imposed through military force or restoration of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan”. This is largely in line with the position taken by India, which holds the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council for August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-preps-for-rapid-evacuation-of-its-nationals-in-afghanistan-amid-taliban-blitz-101628873036460.html

To study the pandemic’s on early childhood cognitive development, researchers from Rhode Island Hospital and Brown University examined general childhood cognitive scores in 2020 and 2021 against the preceding decade by leveraging a large ongoing longitudinal study of child neurodevelopment.Since the beginning of the pandemic, countries around the world have imposed several restrictions to contain the virus, including stay-at-home orders that led to the shutting down of businesses, daycares, schools, playgrounds. The parents who could manage to work from home faced challenges in providing full-time attentive childcare.The study suggests that the children under the age of five, who have been largely spared from the severe health complications associated with Covid-19, have not been immune to the impact of social distancing measures, including stay-at-home orders. The coronavirus-induced guidelines have disrupted their educational opportunities, reduced physical activity levels, and limited interaction with other children.The study included 672 healthy children between 3 months to 3 years of age from the state of Rhode Island in the United States. The researchers found that even in the absence of direct infection, the environmental changes associated with the pandemic are significantly and negatively affecting infant and child development. The researchers also found that males and children in lower socioeconomic families were most affected.“The Covid-19 pandemic has fundamentally altered the child health landscape, with pregnant mothers and individuals, and children living in a strikingly different economic, psychosocial, and educational environment than what was present just 18 months ago,” the study says.The study is yet to be peer-reviewed and is currently available on the preprint server.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/children-born-during-covid-19-pandemic-have-reduced-cognitive-performance-study-101628867410958.html

The video, which was not independently authenticated by Hindustan Times showed Taliban leaders sitting at a huge hall that reportedly belongs to 67-year-old Afghan warlord Dostum.An estimated 65 per cent of Afghan territory have been captured by Taliban insurgents as the force is now nearing the gates of Kabul. On Friday, the Taliban captured Kandahar, Logar province, Lashkar Gah and Herat. The situation escalated after US president Joe Biden on April 14 announced the withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan starting May 1. This led to Taliban insurgence and all cities, one by one, have started to fall in front of Taliban forces.

13-08-2021||World||Taliban near gates of Kabul as embassies prepare for evacuations||The Taliban seized more major cities on Friday as they raced to take full control of Afghanistan and inched closer to Kabul, with the United States and Britain deploying thousands of troops to evacuate their citizens from the capital.The evacuation orders came as the Taliban took control of Kandahar -- the nation's second-biggest city -- in the insurgency's heartland, leaving only Kabul and pockets of other territories in government hands.The Taliban also captured the capital of Logar province, just 50kms (30 miles) from Kabul, with a local lawmaker saying the insurgents were in complete control of Pul-e-Alam city.Earlier Friday, officials and residents in Kandahar told AFP that government forces had withdrawn en masse to a military facility outside the southern city."Kandahar is completely conquered. The Mujahideen reached Martyrs' Square," a Taliban spokesman tweeted, referring to a city landmark.Hours later, the Taliban said they had also taken control of Lashkar Gah, the capital of neighbouring Helmand province.A security source confirmed the fall of the city, telling AFP that the Afghan military and government officials had evacuated Lashkar Gah after striking a local ceasefire deal with the militants.The government has now effectively lost most of the country following an eight-day blitz into urban centres by the Taliban that has also stunned Kabul's American backers.The first wave of the offensive was launched in early May after the United States and its allies all but withdrew their forces from Afghanistan, with President Joe Biden determined to end two decades of war by September 11.Also Read | To save Afghanistan, act against Pakistan- 'Not abandonment' -Biden insists he does not regret his decision, but the speed and ease of the Taliban's urban victories in recent days has been a surprise and forced new calculations.Washington and London announced plans late Thursday to pull out their embassy staff and citizens from the capital."We are further reducing our civilian footprint in Kabul in light of the evolving security situation," US State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters, while noting the embassy would remain open."This is not abandonment. This is not an evacuation. This is not the wholesale withdrawal."The Pentagon said 3,000 US troops would be deployed to Kabul within the next 24 to 48 hours, underscoring they would not be used to launch attacks against the Taliban.NATO was also set to hold an urgent meeting later on Friday about the deteriorating situation, diplomatic and official sources told AFP.Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg will lead discussions with envoys from the 30 allies, with one source saying it would focus on evacuation planning.- Taliban flags across Kandahar -The conflict has escalated dramatically since May, when US-led forces began the final stage of their troop withdrawal.After months of taking what were considered less strategically important rural areas, the Taliban zeroed in on the cities.The insurgents have taken over more than a dozen provincial capitals in the past week and encircled the biggest city in the north, the traditional anti-Taliban bastion of Mazar-i-Sharif, which is now one of the few holdouts remaining.In Kandahar, resident Abdul Nafi told AFP the city was calm after the government forces pulled out early Friday."I came out this morning, I saw Taliban white flags in most squares of the city... I thought it might be the first day of Eid."Also Read | India joins other nations to assert govt forced on Afghanistan won’t be recognised- Herat strongman captured -And in Herat on Friday, the Taliban said they had captured the city's long-time strongman Ismail Khan, who helped lead the defence of the provincial capital along with his militia fighters.The warlord's spokesman later confirmed Khan had been allowed to return to his residence following negotiations with the insurgents.Pro-Taliban social media accounts have boasted of the vast spoils of war captured by the insurgents, posting photos of armoured vehicles, heavy weapons, and even a drone seized by their fighters at abandoned military bases.After being under siege for weeks, government forces on Thursday pulled out of Herat -- an ancient Silk Road city near the Iranian border -- and retreated to a district army barracks.On Thursday, the interior ministry also confirmed the fall of Ghazni, opening a corridor along the major highway to Kabul from the Taliban heartlands in the south.As the rout unravelled, three days of meetings between key international players on Afghanistan ended in Qatar without significant progress Thursday.In a joint statement, the international community, including the United States, Pakistan, the European Union, and China, said they would not recognise any government in Afghanistan "imposed through the use of military force."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-near-gates-of-kabul-as-embassies-prepare-for-evacuations-101628856688064.html

The expert made these comments according to a documentary released on Thursday by Danish television channel TV2.The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Wuhan branch was handling coronaviruses “without potentially having the same level of expertise or safety or who knows,” said Peter Ben Embarek, a WHO expert of disease transmission from animals to humans, the Associated Press reported, citing footage from the documentary. Ben Embarek made these remarks during a conference call earlier in January, the report further showed.Also read | WHO forms new expert group to continue studies into origins of Covid-19In the documentary, Ben Embarek inspected the stalls at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. He said that the exposure of people who worked in handling live animals in the market could have raised the possibility of the virus infecting people at the market, according to the AP’s report.He also expressed his concerns about the Chinese CDC’s Wuhan branch, which were not previously disclosed by the WHO. Several experts have questioned the possibility of a lab accident at the Wuhan Institute of Virology but the CDC lab has not been the subject of such discussions. “What is more concerning to me is the other lab. The one that is next to the market,” AP quoted Ben Embarek as saying about the CDC lab, which is 500 meters away from the Huanan market. In a separate interview to the channel TV2 in June, Ben Embarek also had said that a lab staffer being infected with the coronavirus while collecting bat samples was “likely.” HT has not individually seen the documentary footage or the interview.However, when the WHO released its findings after its mission in Wuhan, it termed the introduction of the disease through a laboratory incident as “extremely unlikely.” Further, the report also said that a direct zoonotic spillover is considered to be “a possible-to-likely pathway.” While the report showed that the introduction of the disease through an intermediate host is considered a “likely to very likely” pathway, it also said that the introduction through cold or food chain products is a “possible pathway.” Later, WHO’s director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was “premature” to rule out the possibility of a lab leak of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-origin-who-official-expressed-concerns-about-safety-at-lab-near-wuhan-market-shows-report-101628850494238.html

The attacker was trained in Afghanistan and the vehicle used in the attack was brought from Afghanistan to Pakistan…The terrorist network the attacker is associated with has received support from Indian and Afghan intelligence agencies.”In its response, the Chinese foreign ministry added that Pakistan’s investigation into the terror attack has seen major progress in quick time.“China pays great attention to this and expresses appreciation to Pakistan’s active efforts. Further investigation by Pakistan is still ongoing,” foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said in a statement on Friday.“China and Pakistan will follow the important consensus reached by the leaders on both sides, ascertain all the facts and truth, and hold the culprits accountable and bring them to justice,” she said.“In the meanwhile, both countries will keep strengthening security cooperation mechanisms to ensure the safety of Chinese projects, people and institutions in Pakistan,” Hua added.On Thursday, Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi claimed the deadly bus attack was a suicide bombing carried out by Islamist militants backed by Indian and Afghan intelligence agencies, according to a Reuters report.“An Indian government official said the charge was baseless and said Pakistan has made similar accusations repeatedly in the past,” Reuters added.On July 14, the bus carrying the Chinese workers on way to a dam construction site was hit by a blast in the district of Kohistan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Top Pakistani officials including Qureshi and ISI chief Faiz Hameed had rushed to China days after the explosion.After the incident, Chinese premier Li Keqiang had reportedly urged his Pakistani counterpart, Prime Minister Imran Khan, to hold accountable the culprits in what he described as a “terrorist attack”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-appreciates-pak-probe-into-bus-attack-that-killed-9-chinese-nationals-101628843392698.html

13-08-2021||World||China shoots down second WHO probe into origin of Covid-19 virus||China on Friday dismissed the World Health Organization’s (WHO) calls for a renewed probe into the origin of the Covid-19 virus, saying it supported scientific over political efforts to find out how the disease started.The proposal was also made without full consultation with member states, a senior Chinese diplomat said. “We oppose political tracing... and abandoning the joint report”, which was issued after a WHO expert team visited Wuhan in January, vice foreign minister Ma Zhaoxu told reporters. “We support scientific tracing,” Ma added.The Covid-19 virus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 before spreading in and outside China, triggering the worst pandemic in a century. The pandemic has so far claimed more than 4.3 million lives and infected over 205.3 million people, according to the US-based Johns Hopkins University’s widely followed coronavirus tracker. In a briefing with 31 representatives and ambassadors from 29 countries in Beijing, Ma said that recently the WHO secretariat came up with the working proposal for the next phase without fully consulting with its member countries, which has been rejected and doubted. Ma added that Beijing was always ready to cooperate in tracing Covid-19’s origin and had never rejected cooperation. But China rejects the politicisation of the probe, Chinese state media quoted Ma as saying.Quoting Ma, news agency Xinhua reported that China is continuing to conduct “follow-up and supplementary” research into Covid-19’s origin as specified in the WHO joint report.In terms of the next-phase of the Covid-19 origin-tracing work, it should be only done by scientists to find zoonotic origins and transmission pathways, Ma said.The WHO on Thursday urged all governments to cooperate to accelerate studies into the origin of the pandemic and “to depoliticise the situation”.Last month, Ma had told Chinese state media that 48 countries had submitted a joint letter to the WHO director-general on the origin of the Covid-19 virus.“In the letter, they welcome the report of the WHO-convened global study of origins of Sars-CoV-2: China Part, stress that the study of origins is a matter of science and oppose politicisation of this issue,” Ma had said.Blaming the US for trying to smear China over the probe into Covid-19’s origin, he had said that a few forces led by the United States ran counter to science regardless of the facts.“Facts prove again that the political manipulation by use of origin-tracing violates human conscience, and it is immoral and unpopular. The rock they are lifting will end up hitting their own toes,” he said.In June, China had angrily rejected the WHO’s plan for the second phase of the Covid-19 origin study, saying it is “shocked” by the proposal as it contains language that does not respect science.Beijing’s angry reaction came after WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in June that it was premature to rule out a potential link between the Covid-19 pandemic and a laboratory leak, adding that he had asked China to be more transparent as scientists search for the origin of the coronavirus.China has voiced strong opposition against international opinion, which says a high-security bio lab in Wuhan was the source of the virus.National health commission (NHC) vice minister Zeng Yixin told reporters in June that the WHO’s second planned probe had listed the hypothesis that China had violated lab regulations and leaked the virus as one of the major research objectives, and he was “very shocked” after reading the proposal.Zeng said China cannot accept the current version of the WHO plan because it has been compromised by political manipulation and disrespects scientific facts.“We hope the WHO can carefully consider the advice by Chinese scientists, take investigating the origin of the Covid-19 virus as a scientific question free from political interference, and proactively and properly conduct sustained investigations into the origin of the virus in various countries across the world,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-shoots-down-second-who-probe-into-origin-of-covid-19-virus-101628838652082.html
13-08-2021||World||Kabul in Taliban’s cross-hairs make Doha peace talks redundant||The rapid advance of the Taliban towards Kabul and its mounting atrocities on civilians, particularly the minorities, after the US-led coalition forces withdrawal and the pusillanimous retreat of the Afghan government security forces from Kandahar, Herat and Ghazni have not surprised the neighbours of this historically violence-prone country.The military collapse of Afghan security forces makes the fall of Kabul imminent to the Taliban, the ultra-conservative Sunni Pashtun force, and the so-called peace dialogue in Doha, Qatar virtually redundant. The capture of Kabul willy-nilly portrays the US as an exhausted and weak superpower as also poses strong questions on its ability to take on the rising superpower in China. It is quite evident that US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad proved to be no match for Henry Kissinger inspired withdrawal from Vietnam in the end as US forces literally ran away from Kabul without matching even the symbolic resistance in Saigon.Also read | As Taliban captures major cities, reports of killings and torture pour inWith Kabul firmly in the crosshairs of the Taliban, Afghan watchers predict that China will initially follow the lead of Pakistan, the progenitor of the Islamist insurgent group, and recognise the Sunni force as the legitimate ruler of Afghanistan. With the Taliban, Pakistan and China on the same side, human rights will be thrown out of the window and all leverage that the US and its principal advisor the UK had on Afghanistan will be reduced to zero. The next thing to watch will be the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative via the Wakhan corridor to Afghanistan, which has humongous heavy metal resources like lithium used in making the long-range submarine batteries.Also read | US to deploy over 3,000 troops to Afghanistan to help in evacuation of diplomats, special visa applicantsTaliban’s mentor or what is jokingly called the Rawalpindi shura will be the gainer in the short term as ideological leader Mullah Haibatullah Akundzada, military leaders Mullah Yaqoob and Sirajuddin Haqqani are all under the protection of Pakistan. Akundzada is said to be in Karachi military cantonment, Mullah Yaqoob is shuttling between Helmand and Quetta, and boss of Haqqani terrorist group and lately a newspaper columnist Sirajuddin is also in Quetta. Already, the best of US military equipment including Humvees, Cougars, Buffalo and Caimans along with shoulder-launched drones, area weapons and body armour have been captured by the Taliban and will be tactically moved to Pakistan from Afghanistan in a matter of time. Although UK agencies are said to have moved their communication surveillance equipment from Afghanistan, one should not be surprised if such technical equipment is now in the hands of ISI headquarters in Rawalpindi. This is predictable based on the situation on the ground but the doomsday scenario is not too far away even as the international community is ready for another talkathon at the UNGA in September 2021.Also read | British men fighting for Taliban as it mounts offensive: ReportWhile New Delhi has no options but to be prepared, it was never really in the brutal power game in Kabul as it did not send troops on the ground or even give weapons to the Afghan government. Where power speaks from AK-47 and M-4 assault rifles and daisy cutter bombs, humanitarian and infrastructure assistance mean practically zilch. India’s main challenge, however, will come when Pakistan shifts the terror training camps of terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed to Taliban-occupied Afghanistan for future terror strikes against India. Already, transnational terrorist groups like the al Qaeda, Islamic State, East Turkestan Islamic Movement and Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan are thriving under the protection of the Taliban in Afghanistan. With state of the art close-quarter US weapons available to the Taliban, the future terror strikes will be much more lethal and violent all over the world. And that includes Pakistan too, for it is only a matter of time when the fault-lines within the Taliban erupt over control of Kabul.Also read | UNSC mulling over draft statement condemning Taliban offensive: ReportIf India is going to be at the receiving end of radicalised Islamists, other countries in the region including Iran, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Myanmar will also not be secure in wake of a Sunni force taking over Kabul. The Central Asian Republics under the leadership of Russia and Shia Iran will not take things lying down and are waiting for the withdrawal of US forces and the fall of Kabul before their next move. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has already said it recognises India’s legitimate interest in Afghanistan.

13-08-2021||World||Fred, moving towards Florida, may ‘regain’ tropical storm status||Tropical depression Fred was slowly strengthening and could regain tropical storm status sometime on Friday, forecasters said.The system was dropping heavy rain over parts of Cuba in the early morning hours and was on a forecast track that would carry it toward South Florida by Saturday, the US National Weather Service said.The main threats were rain and flooding. Forecasters issued a tropical storm watch Thursday evening for the Florida Keys and the state’s southwest coast. The hurricane center said 3 to 6 inches (7.5 to 15 centimeters) of rain were expected across the Florida Keys and southern peninsula by Monday, with isolated maximums of 8 inches (20 centimeters).The tropical storm watch also included the Cuban provinces of Ciego de Avila, Camaguey, Las Tunas, Holguin and Granma.Once a tropical storm, Fred weakened back to a depression by its spin over Haiti and the Dominican Republic, where it knocked out power to some 400,000 customers and caused flooding that forced officials to shut down part of the country's aqueduct system, interrupting water service for hundreds of thousands of people.Local officials reported hundreds of people were evacuated and some buildings were damaged. There were no immediate reports of casualties.Heavy rains on Thursday continued to pound Hispaniola, which the two nations share.The Miami-based U.S. hurricane center said Fred had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph) Friday morning and was centered just north of Cuba's coast.The system was about 410 miles (660 kilometers) east-southeast of Key West, Florida. That was also about 165 miles (265 kilometers) southeast of Southern Andros Island in the Bahamas.Fred was headed west-northwest at 9 mph (15 kph).The system was expected to produce 3 to 5 inches (7.5 to 12.5 centimeters) of rain across the Dominican Republic and the western Bahamas, as well as 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.5 centimeters) over Haiti, the Turks and Caicos, the eastern Bahamas, and Cuba.Fred became the sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season late Tuesday as it moved past the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fred-moving-towards-florida-may-regain-tropical-storm-status-101628835684438.html
13-08-2021||World||International Lefthanders Day 2021: History, significance and all you need to know||August 13 is observed annually as the International Lefthanders Day to celebrate the “uniqueness and differences of left-handed individuals.” The day was first observed in 1976 by Dean R Campbell, the founder of Lefthanders International Inc. Further, in 1990, the Lefthanders International Club was founded with an aim to promote left handedness, and make their views known to manufacturers towards development of items for left-handed individuals. In 1992, the Club launched the International Lefthanders Day to create awareness regarding the “advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed.”The day is now celebrated worldwide, with around 20 events taking place in the United Kingdom alone. Though only around 10% of the world’s population is left-handed, this group includes several prominent personalities. Former two-time US president Barack Obama, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, pop singers Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga, talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Apple founder Steve Jobs etc. were all left-handed. From among historical figures, this informal group includes the likes of Sir Isaac Newton, Pablo Picasso, Napoleon Bonaparte etc.Several prominent personalities from India, too, use their left hand for day-to-day works. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, former cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, actor Amitabh Bachchan, industrialist Ratan Tata etc. are all left-handed.Left-handers are likely to have better verbal skills than their right-handed counterparts, according to a 2019 study by Oxford University. The basis of this conclusion was a discovery by the researchers that left and right hemispheres of brains of left-handed individuals had better co-ordination in regions involving the use of language. The scientists, though, also cautioned that their study sample constituted just a fraction of the world’s left-handed population, adding that more research is required to reach a definitive conclusion in this regard.Additionally, the research also found that left-handers were at slightly lower risk of both schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-lefthanders-day-2021-history-significance-and-all-you-need-to-know-101628832768990.html

The killings and torturing of civilians come even as the United Nations has warned that a Taliban offensive reaching the capital would have a "catastrophic impact on civilians".Two children were killed and four were wounded in a mortar strike by the Taliban in Khost province and a Ghazni based judge Abdul Matin Atayee was killed in an ambush on Wednesday.

13-08-2021||World||China rejects need for further WHO coronavirus origins probe||China on Friday rejected the World Health Organization's calls for a renewed probe into the origins of Covid-19, saying it supported "scientific" over "political" efforts to find out how the virus started.Pressure is once more mounting on Beijing to consider a fresh probe into the orgins of a pandemic which has killed more than four million people and paralysed economies worldwide since it first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.A WHO team of international experts went to Wuhan in January 2021 to produce a first phase report, which was written in conjunction with their Chinese counterparts. It failed to find a conclusive position on how the virus began.On Thursday the WHO urged China to share raw data from the earliest Covid-19 cases to revive its probe into the origins of the disease.China hit back, repeating its position that the initial investigation was enough and that calls for further data were motivated by politics instead of scientific inquiry."We oppose political tracing ... and abandoning the joint report" issued after the WHO expert team's Wuhan visit in January, vice foreign minister Ma Zhaoxu told reporters. "We support scientific tracing."That report said the virus jumping from bats to humans via an intermediate animal was the most probable scenario, while a leak from the Wuhan virology labs was "extremely unlikely".Ma rejected suggestions of new lines of investigation."The conclusions and recommendations of WHO and China joint report were recognised by the international community and the scientific community," he said."Future global traceability work should and can only be further carried out on the basis of this report, rather than starting a new one."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-rejects-need-for-further-who-coronavirus-origins-probe-101628831936613.html
13-08-2021||World||Canadian PM Justin Trudeau likely to call snap polls||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appears set to take the considerable risk of holding snap elections to secure a majority in the House of Commons despite health authorities formally declaring that a fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is now under way.According to multiple news outlets, Trudeau is expected to meet governor-general Mary Simon on Sunday for starting the election process, formally called dropping of the writ, and polls will be held on September 20. This was first reported by Reuters and the French-language outlet La Presse and confirmed by others. The Hindustan Times has also confirmed this likelihood.The Trudeau-led Liberal Party government is in a minority in the House of Commons, with 155 MPs, as against 119 for the principal Opposition party, the Conservatives. When the last Federal elections were held in October 2019, the Liberals captured 157 seats, short of the 170 majority mark and also trailed the Conservatives in vote share, with 31.1% against 34.3%.However, most polls have suggested the Liberals have a lead now, with the latest from the non-profit Angus Reid Institute putting them at 36% support, five points ahead of the Conservatives.But it stated, “As members of the fifth estate speculate about the exact date the prime minister is expected to call a general election, Canadians are more occupied by fears of a fourth wave of Covid-19 than politics.” In fact, 52% of respondents fear contracting the coronavirus, a five point increase over the figure for July.Their fears will not be assuaged by the statement on Thursday from Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam, who told reporters during a briefing: “We have been closely monitoring increases in Covid-19 activity across the country. The latest national surveillance data indicate that a fourth wave is under way in Canada and that cases are plotting along a strong resurgence trajectory.” She also said there were more than 13,000 active cases in the country, more than double the figure for late July. When questioned about the possible election, Tam demurred and said, “It’s not my role to advise on whether there should be an election or not.”Earlier this week, the Ottawa-based watchdog organisation Democracy Watch started a petition asking the governor-general to turn down a request for snap elections, stating such polls “would be illegal, dishonest, and unfair and dangerous for many voters”.But such a refusal from the governor-general hasn’t occurred in 95 years and seems extremely unlikely and Canadians appear to be headed back to the polls less than two years since the last Federal elections were held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-trudeau-likely-to-call-snap-polls-101628830790988.html

These troops will deploy to the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul immediately. Another 1,000 personnel will be sent to Qatar to process Afghans who are being evacuated and relocated to the US on special visa. Another 3,500 troops will deploy from a base in the US to Kuwait to stand prepared to be sent to Afghanistan if needed.Defence secretary Lloyd Austin has ordered the department to “position temporary enabling capabilities to ensure the safety and security of US and partner civilian personnel”, said John Kirby, the chief Pentagon spokesperson, at a news briefing, referring to an earlier order from President Joe Biden reducing US diplomatic presence.“I want to stress that these forces are being deployed to support the orderly and safe reduction of civilian personnel at the request of the state department and to help facilitate an accelerated process of working through SIV applicants,” Kirby said, adding, “This is a temporary mission with a narrow focus.”The additional deployment announcement came amidst growing concerns in Biden administration with the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, as a result of the Taliban advancing far more rapidly than anticipated.Kirby insisted the additional deployment will not affect the withdrawal timeline, which is geared towards completion by the end August.The US had planned to leave about 650 troops after the completion of the drawdown for the security of its embassy and personnel. But, it’s now beefing up its presence. Although it’s a temporary measure, Kirby gave no indication to the duration of their planned stay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-deploy-3-000-troops-to-afghanistan-101628828690729.html

The Sun cited a senior military intelligence official as saying they have intercepted phone calls of terrorists with British accents. "We have received some intercepts of two British men, probably below 30, talking openly on mobiles," the official was quoted as saying by The Sun.The Taliban captured Kandahar, the country's second-largest city, on Friday in what is one of the group's biggest military victories since it began the offensive in May.Another unnamed security personnel said there was “intermittent intelligence” showing British men had taken up arms against the Afghan government. “We have no idea who they are. It’s difficult to put a number on it,” the official told The Sun.Also read | Taliban claim to capture Afghanistan's second-largest city of Kandahar: ReportsAccording to The Sun, security officials believe that the British men travelled to Afghanistan through Pakistan’s tribal areas to reach the frontlines. Days ago, Taliban commander General Mubeen was heard talking in a Facebook video about attending Birmingham University.“Many British and other foreign jihadists travelled to Afghanistan before and after 9/11 to fight there and, in many cases train, organise and then travel elsewhere for jihad,” former colonel Richard Kemp, who led UK forces in Afghanistan, told The Sun. “The more gains the Taliban makes, the more it will encourage jihadists to carry out attacks at home and also head for Afghanistan," he said,"If the country, or a large part of it, is permanently controlled by the Taliban it will again become a safe haven for terrorists as it was before 9/11. We are on the verge of a threat no less than that from IS at its height.”Also read | UNSC mulling over draft statement condemning Taliban offensive: ReportIt came as Britain said it would deploy around 600 troops to Afghanistan to help its citizens and interpreters and other Afghan staff leave Afghanistan. The UK defence ministry said in a statement the troops will provide protection and logistical support for the relocation of British nationals where required. Around 4,000 British nationals are believed to be in Afghanistan.The US has also said that it is sending an additional 3,000 troops to Afghanistan to assist in the evacuation of some personnel from the USe embassy in Kabul.The Taliban captured Kandahar along with more key regional cities as US military intelligence assessment suggested Kabul could come under Taliban within 30 days. It also said that the group could gain full control of the country within a few months. Most of the country is now under the Taliban's control.

For SARS-CoV-2, it will support the rapid undertaking of recommended studies outlined in the March 2021 report," the WHO said in a statement on Thursday.WHO last month proposed a second phase of studies into the origins of the coronavirus in China, including audits of laboratories and markets in the city of Wuhan. Beijing, meanwhile, had rejected WHO's proposal.In a statement issued on Thursday, WHO called for all governments to depoliticize the situation."To move forward, WHO calls for all governments to depoliticize the situation and cooperate to accelerate the origins studies, and importantly to work together to develop a common framework for future emerging pathogens of pandemic potential," the statement read.The WHO expressed hope that all countries, including China, can collaborate and put in place the conditions for more missions to be sent to Wuhan to duly probe the "lab hypothesis."The WHO declared the Covid-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020. To date, more than 205 million people have been infected with the coronavirus worldwide, and more than 4.3 million died, according to the US-based Johns Hopkins University.The first WHO fact-finding mission to China's Wuhan, where the first Covid-19 outbreak was reported in late 2019, released its report in March. A WHO-led team of scientists struggled to get a clear picture of what research China was conducting beforehand, faced constraints during its visit, and had little power to conduct thorough and impartial research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-forms-new-expert-group-to-continue-studies-into-origins-of-covid19-101628822719326.html

The statement, seen by the Reuters news agency, is reportedly being drafted by the countries of Estonia and Norway. The draft has to be agreed upon by the 15-member UN body before it becomes a formal condemnation, the agency cited diplomats as saying.Also Read | Taliban claim to capture Afghanistan's second-largest city of Kandahar: ReportsThe UNSC draft statement, once formal, would condemn “in the strongest terms possible” the armed attacks by Taliban forces on cities and towns across Afghanistan, which have resulted in a large number of civilian casualties. The development comes amid a highly precarious political situation in the country, as the Taliban insurgents continue to take over provincial capitals in a move to further pressurise the Ashraf Ghani government operating from Kabul.Taliban claimed to have captured Kandahar, the second-largest city in Afghanistan and the birthplace of the movement, on Friday. According to news agencies, the insurgents have taken control of as many as 12 of Afghanistan's provincial capitals by now and still continue to press forward with mounting offensives.The UNSC draft statement condemning the Taliban "strongly affirms that the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is not recognized at the United Nations and declares that it does not and will not support the establishment of any government in Afghanistan imposed through military force or restoration of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan."Also Read | Powered by Pakistan, Taliban racing towards KabulThe draft text also underlines a council "readiness to impose additional measures on those responsible for violations or abuses of human rights or violations of international humanitarian law, including those involved in attacks targeting civilians, and individuals or entities engaging in, or providing support for, acts that threaten peace, stability or security."Deborah Lyons, the UN special envoy for Afghanistan, told the Security Council last week that the situation in the country has entered a “deadlier and more destructive phase” and also doubted the Taliban's commitment to a political settlement. (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unsc-mulling-over-draft-statement-condemning-taliban-offensive-report-101628820616526.html

Taliban fighters rushed past the Great Mosque in the historic city and seized government buildings. Witnesses described hearing sporadic gunfire at one government building while the rest of the city fell silent under the insurgents’ control.In neighbouring Kandahar, the Taliban attacked a prison in the city and freed inmates inside on Wednesday night, officials said. On Thursday, Kandahar’s provincial governor spokesman Bahir Ahmadi acknowledged that the Taliban had entered the capital, Kandahar city, but said Afghan forces were fighting to push them back.Earlier, the capture of Ghazni cut off a crucial highway linking the Afghan capital with the country’s southern provinces, which similarly find themselves under assault as part of an insurgent push some 20 years after US and Nato troops ousted the Taliban government.While Kabul itself isn’t directly under threat immediately, the losses and the battles elsewhere further tighten the grip of a resurgent Taliban, who are estimated to now hold over two-thirds of the nation and are continuing to pressure government forces in several other provincial capitals.400,000 people displacedNearly 400,000 people have been displaced in Afghanistan since the start of the year, with a massive spike in numbers since May, Stephane Dujarric, a spokesperson for United Nations chief Antonio Guterres said on Wednesday amid the deteriorating security situation in the war-torn country.Clashes erupt at borderPakistani forces clashed on Thursday with hundreds of Afghans stranded on Pakistan’s side of a border crossing with Afghanistan after its closure by Taliban insurgents.The disturbances broke out after an Afghan traveller died from a heart attack as he waited in the heat to enter Afghanistan via the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing.

Another female died a short time later in hospital, the police added.Police had earlier described the shooting as a "serious firearms incident" and said the situation was contained. The police added that the incident was not related to terrorism.The United Kingdom has one of the lowest gun homicide rates in the world, and mass shootings are rare.Sharron Turner, 57, who lives behind the scene of the shooting, told The Times newspaper that a gunman had "kicked in" the front door of a semi-detached house before shooting a young mother and her daughter, who was aged about five. Turner said she had been told that the man, who was dressed in black and grey, was armed with a semi-automatic weapon.After the attack, the gunman escaped through a park behind the house and shot two dog walkers, The Times reported."The incident in Plymouth is shocking and my thoughts are with those affected," Home Secretary Priti Patel said on Twitter.Devon and Cornwall Police said they were called to the Keyham area of the city at 6.10 p.m. on Thursday."Investigations are continuing into the incident and disruption to the road network in the Keyham area will remain throughout the night," the police said.The South Western Ambulance Service earlier said it had responded to the incident with a significant number of resources, including Hazardous Area Response Teams (HART), multiple ambulances, air ambulances, multiple doctors and senior paramedics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-number-of-people-killed-in-mass-shooting-in-plymouth-england-101628811351217.html

The Pentagon said 3,000 US troops would be deployed to Kabul within the next 24 to 48 hours and stressed that they would not be used to launch attacks against the Taliban. "We are further reducing our civilian footprint in Kabul in light of the evolving security situation," US State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters. "This is not abandonment. This is not an evacuation. This is not the wholesale withdrawal," he said.Also read | India rules out immediate closure of embassy in AfghanistanUK defence secretary Ben Wallace said London would send 600 of its troops to evacuate its nationals and "support the relocation of former Afghan staff who risked their lives serving alongside us".According to AP, the seizure of Kandahar and Herat marks the biggest prizes yet for the Taliban.

13-08-2021||World||Taliban advance on major Afghan cities as US, UK troops to aid evacuations||The United States and Britain said on Thursday they would send thousands of troops to Afghanistan to help evacuate civilians, as the Taliban stood poised for their two biggest military victories since they began a broad offensive in May.In response to the militants' swift and violent advances  that are further loosening the Afghan government's hold on the country, the Pentagon said it would temporarily send about 3,000 extra troops within 48 hours to help evacuate embassy staff.Britain said it would deploy around 600 troops to help its nationals and local translators get out.While it is common for the US military to send in troops to evacuate personnel in combat zones, the reinforcements will fly in just weeks before the departure of the last of the US-led international force that has had a core role in maintaining security in the country.South and west of Kabul, the country's second- and third-largest cities were on the verge of being seized by the Taliban.The fall of major cities was a sign that Afghans welcome the Taliban, a spokesperson for the group said, according to Al Jazeera TV. The Taliban were ousted by US-led troops in 2001 after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.The Islamist group claimed control over Herat close to the Iranian border, and a diplomatic source and a witness said it also appeared close to capturing Kandahar in the south, the spiritual home of the group that now controls about two-thirds of the country.Earlier in the day, the Taliban established a bridgehead within 150 km (95 miles) of Kabul.As the United Nations warned that a Taliban offensive reaching the capital would have a "catastrophic impact on civilians," the United States, as well as Germany, urged their citizens to leave Afghanistan immediately.In Qatar, international envoys to Afghan negotiations called for an accelerated peace process as a "matter of great urgency," and for an immediate halt to attacks on cities.'WE ARE RETURNING TO A DARK TIME'If its capture is confirmed, Herat would be the 10th provincial capital - and the most significant - that the Taliban have taken in the past week."As you can see, we are inside the Herat police headquarters right now," a Taliban fighter said in a video that the group's spokesperson, Qari Yousuf Ahmadi, shared.In Kandahar, most parts of the city were under the group's control but fighting was still going on, a Taliban commander told Reuters.A women's rights activist there, who asked not to be named for security reasons, said heavy clashes were under way and only the city's military bases and airport remained under government control.She felt certain that restrictions imposed on women by the Taliban when the group ruled the country from 1996-2001 would return."We can no longer talk about women's rights. We are returning to a dark time where there is no hope," she said.Earlier on Thursday, the Taliban captured Ghazni, situated on the Kandahar-to-Kabul road some 150 km (90 miles) southwest of the capital.On Wednesday, a US defense official cited US intelligence as saying the Taliban could isolate Kabul in 30 days and possibly take it over within 90.With phone lines down across much of the country, Reuters was unable to contact government officials to confirm which of the cities under attack remained in government hands.URGED TO LEAVEThe speed and violence of the Taliban offensive have sparked recriminations among many Afghans over President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw US troops and leave the government to fight alone.Biden said on Tuesday he does not regret his decision, noting that Washington has spent more than $1 trillion over 20 years in America's longest war and lost thousands of troops. He added the United States continues to provide significant air support, food, equipment and salaries to Afghan forces.Al Jazeera reported a government source saying it had offered the Taliban a share in power if the violence stopped. It was not clear to what extent the reported offer differed from terms already discussed in Qatar.Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said he was unaware of any such offer but ruled out sharing power."We won't accept any offer like this because we don’t want to be partner with the Kabul administration. We neither stay nor work for a single day with it," he said.In a deal struck with former US President Donald Trump's administration last year, the insurgents agreed not to attack US-led foreign forces as they withdraw. The Taliban also made a commitment to discuss peace.But intermittent talks with representatives of the US-backed government have made no progress, with the insurgents apparently intent on a military victory.The international envoys in Doha, who met with Afghan government negotiators and Taliban representatives, also reaffirmed that foreign capitals would not recognise any government in Afghanistan "imposed through the use of military force."Given the speed of the Taliban's advance, prospects for diplomatic pressure to affect the situation on the ground seemed limited, although the Taliban spokesman told Al Jazeera: "We will not close the door to the political track."Critics said the rapid erosion of Afghan government-held territory and the hasty American evacuation called to mind the fall of Saigon during the Vietnam War."This is a huge foreign policy failure with generationalramifications just shy of seven months into this administration. Everything points to a complete collapse," said former State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-advance-on-major-afghan-cities-as-us-uk-troops-to-aid-evacuations-101628804826128.html
13-08-2021||World||Covid in US: Hospitals pushed to brink as Delta sparks hunt for more staff||US hospitals are desperately hunting for medical staff as the Covid-19 wave that’s pushing some systems to their breaking point in the South spills into the rest of the country.More than a dozen states face severe shortages of personnel, US Department of Health and Human Services data show. In Texas and Hawaii, hospitals are building tents for extra space. In Florida, the federal government has deployed hundreds of ventilators to Florida in a rare tapping of the Strategic National Stockpile for that equipment.The scramble comes as hospitals in hard-hit states say they’re reaching surge capacity, canceling elective procedures again and turning away transfer patients, a jolting warning for parts of the country where cases are just beginning to rise again.“What we’re running short of most critically is staffing,” said Hilton Raethel, chief executive officer of the Healthcare Association of Hawaii, which just contracted for 550 new hospital workers -- mostly nurses -- at a cost of $46 million for eight weeks.Mississippi could see “failure of the hospital system” within 10 days, Alan Jones, a top official with the University of Mississippi Medical Center, said Wednesday.Hospitals in the US have admitted an average of 9,700 patients over the past seven days, an increase of 31% from the prior week, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said during a news briefing Thursday.Those numbers are all the more challenging because hospitals are now contending with a major rush of Covid-19 patients alongside non-Covid traffic that had been returning to normal levels. In many states, commerce and tourism have also staged a comeback, meaning those looking to bring in outside staff will have to compete with leisure travelers for the price of rooms and other transportation.In 17 states, at least 15% of hospitals are experiencing critical staffing shortages, up from 12 two weeks earlier, HHS data show.Covid-19 patients still represent less than half of intensive-care unit beds in every state. But hospital administrators fear they won’t have enough staff overall to treat critically ill patients, with our without Covid-19. Many have already had to cancel elective procedures again and turn away transfer patients from other facilities. Some are facing surging waiting times in emergency departments.Surgeries DelayedRobert Peltier, chief medical officer with North Oaks Health System in Louisiana, said he would never forget the challenge of telling a recent brain surgery candidate that his procedure would have to wait.“All this gentlemen could say was, ‘You must have a hard job,’” said Peltier. “This guy was facing something that if he bleeds he is probably not going to make it. He had a time-sensitive procedure that I’m having to cancel.”The man eventually got his surgery.Often, hospitals have the beds but not the staffing, especially in some overwhelmed rural areas such as those in Texas, according to Stephen Love, chief executive of Dallas-Fort Worth Hospital Council. “We already have a very exhausted staff,” Love said.In the South, hospitalizations have soared far faster than in earlier waves. And even though patients have tended to be somewhat younger, many have gotten so sick that they’ve flooded intensive-care units.In Florida, some hospitals have already done all they can to retrofit spare space in conference rooms and cafeterias for patients, according to Mary Mayhew, chief executive officer of the Florida Hospital Association.“Hospitals are aggressively looking at ways to recruit travel nurses through staffing agencies,” she said. “But that is more and more difficult as other states are experiencing increases in Covid hospitalizations.”She said the facilities in her network continue to face logistical challenges such as ensuring adequate oxygen supplies, given the recent surge in demand. Earlier this week, the Strategic National Stockpile had to deploy 200 ventilators and 100 high-flow nasal cannula kits to the Sunshine State, a type of request that had become rare since the height of the pandemic.LouAnn Woodward, vice chancellor for health affairs at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, said hospitals are sometimes forced to make difficult calls on whether to add beds or not.“You might just think, ‘OK, well then open them,’” she said. “But things get to a point where you feel like the situation is not safe and you’re not providing the appropriate level of care to the patient.”Heather Freiheit, a nurse who has been working as a liaison for the US government in hard-hit hospitals, said health-care staff are as tired as they have ever been.“It’s emotionally draining for health-care providers to have to go in day after day and care for patients,” said Freiheit, who works as an operations officer for the Department of Health and Human Services and is currently deployed in Louisiana, “especially when most of the patients we’re seeing right now are unvaccinated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-in-us-hospitals-pushed-to-brink-as-delta-sparks-hunt-for-more-staff-101628793250736.html
