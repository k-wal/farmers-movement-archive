As the generals loosened their grip, culminating in Aung San Suu Kyi’s rise to leadership in 2015 elections, the international community responded by lifting most sanctions and pouring investment into the country. The Feb. 1 coup followed November elections, which Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party won overwhelmingly and the military contests as fraudulent.Schraner Burgener said Myanmar’s military leader, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, wants to maintain his grip on power, pointing to the recent declaration naming him prime minister, the annulment of November’s election and fears that Suu Kyi’s party will soon be disbanded.In her wide-ranging discussions with all sides in Myanmar, she said she realized no sides “will give up and are ready to make any compromises.”So she said she decided not to wait for the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations known as ASEAN to appoint a special envoy and moved ahead with her proposal for an all-inclusive dialogue that would also include discussions of humanitarian assistance, the plight of Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslim minority and “root causes” — the country’s federal system, constitution, army, election and legal systems, and more.Over the last two months, Schraner Burgener said, she discussed her proposal with key parties in Myanmar and the international community.Her proposal also envisions an international observer group including China, India, Japan, Thailand, United States, United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland, European Union, United Nations and ASEAN, which includes Myanmar.During her discussions, she said Myanmar’s ethnic armed organizations “were in the majority very positive of this idea” and members of the National United Government, established by elected legislators who were barred from taking their seats when the military seized power on Feb. 1, were “interested in the ideal but clearly would have preconditions to start such a dialogue.”Schraner Burgener said she had a long conversation with deputy military chief Soe Win on July 16 on many issues including the proposal for a dialogue, but “I didn’t receive an answer,” and since then, “There is no positive feedback from the army on this dialogue, which I really regret.”Nonetheless, she said, a dialogue will hopefully start through ASEAN and its new special envoy for Myanmar, Brunei’s Second Foreign Minister Erywan Yusof. She said she had a long videoconference Monday with Yusof, who plans to visit Myanmar after consulting key parties, and told him, “He can count on my full support.”“I also offered to join him, so I hope that the army will be ready also to receive me,” she said, adding that she believes the military keeps saying it’s not ready to meet her not because they don’t want to talk to her but “because people on the ground would be very encouraged by my presence in the country, and that’s probably something which the army doesn’t want to see.”Schraner Burgener said she remains worried that the country will move in the direction of a civil war if the dialogue, which hopefully will start through ASEAN, “will not be successfully done.”“We see a lot of violence on the ground,” she said.Many people are afraid of “the huge violence scale” of the military, she said, but “the people’s defense forces” have also moved from using self-made weapons and “are using now professional weapons.”“So, I really hope that a dialogue can happen to avoid a breakout of a full-scale civil war,” Schraner Burgener said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-envoy-warns-of-myanmar-civil-war-if-no-successful-talks-101628618596465.html
10-08-2021||World||Germany to end free Covid-19 tests for citizens in October||Germany is ending free coronavirus tests for its citizens from October, in part to encourage people to get vaccinated, government officials said Tuesday.Chancellor Angela Merkel said the country had sufficient vaccines for its population - more than half is already fully immunized — and that studies showed they are effective in preventing severe cases of Covid-19, including ones caused by highly contagious virus variants.“The not-so-good news is that the speed of vaccination has declined significantly,” Merkel said after a Tuesday meeting with the country’s 16 state governors.While federal and state officials agreed that people who are fully vaccinated, have recovered from Covid-19 or have recently tested negative should continue to be treated equally in most situations, they also decided that German citizens will have to start paying for their own tests starting Oct. 11.Some German politicians had criticized the proposal, arguing that it amounts to a tax on the poor. Others claimed that ending free testing is a way of punishing individuals who refuse to get vaccinated.After a sluggish start and only really gaining from March onward, Germany's vaccination campaign has lost speed in recent weeks. Officials worry the country may not reach the target set by the federal disease control agency of immunizing at least 85% of people between ages 12 and 59 and 90% of those over 60.In response to the drop in demand, officials have begun pushing for more vaccinations at megastores and in city centers, or offering incentives to get people to show up to get shots.Bavaria's state governor, Markus Soeder, said it would not be fair to those who are vaccinated if they have to keep paying for others' free tests.Soeder added that in his opinion, vaccinated individuals should not be subject to another lockdown if the infection rate rises in the fall.While Germany has a relatively low number of confirmed virus cases compared to other European countries, cases are rising again. Authorities fear unvaccinated Germans, especially young people, may contract and spread the virus in the coming weeks and months.On Monday, the country's disease control agency registered 2,480 new cases, about 700 more than a week earlier. Some 45.6 million people in Germany, or almost 55% of the population, are fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-to-end-free-covid-19-tests-for-citizens-in-october-101628617090444.html
10-08-2021||World||New York governor Cuomo resigns as allegations of sexual harassment snowball||New York state’s Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Tuesday that he was resigning after days of defying growing calls for him to step aside over allegations of sexual harassment by 11 women, including current and former government employees.“New York tough means New York loving. And I love New York. And I love you. And everything I have ever done has been motivated by that love,” Cuomo said, adding that the best way for him to serve New York state was to step aside. His resignation will be effective 14 days from now.Kathy Hochul, a 62-year-old Democrat and former member of the US Congress, will take over from Cuomo and become the state’s first woman governor.Cuomo, a three-term governor, had gained celebrity status for his leadership and handling of the Covid-19 pandemic in New York state, which had been hit the hardest, especially when compared to then US president Donald Trump.Last week, an independent investigation ordered by the New York state’s attorney general Letitia James found that the governor had sexually harassed the 11 women between 2013 and 2020. Brittany Commisso, who was identified in the attorney general’s report as executive assistant No. 1 but has since come forward publicly, said Cuomo had once sexually abused her. She has publicly spoken about the episode in interviews.Also, a state trooper assigned to Cuomo’s security detail had said the governor had once sexually misbehaved with her when they were in a lift.The outgoing New York governor and his personal lawyer have disputed Commisso’s allegations, which she has reported to the police. Cuomo has said that in the other charges he’s facing, he did not mean to touch the women inappropriately and that he was sorry if they felt offended.“I take full responsibility for my actions. I have been too familiar with people,” Cuomo said in televised remarks. “In my mind, I’ve never crossed the line with anyone,” he said, adding that he did not realise the degree to which the “line has been redrawn”.Cuomo said his instinct was to fight, but because the allegations were mostly political and would drag on to distract the government from functioning normally, he was stepping down.He said, “I would never want to be unhelpful in any way, and I think that given the circumstances, the best way I can help now is if I step aside and let the government get back to government, and therefore that’s what I’ll do.”The New York state assembly had launched an impeachment inquiry against him amid mounting calls for his resignation, including from US President Joe Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-governor-cuomo-resigns-as-allegations-of-sexual-harassment-snowball-101628616682686.html
10-08-2021||World||UK reports biggest daily Covid-19 deaths since March even as 75% adults fully vaccinated||The United Kingdom on Tuesday reported the highest single-day deaths related to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) since March. According to the official data, 146 people across the UK, who had tested positive for Covid-19 within 28 days, have died in the last 24 hours, taking the country’s overall death toll to 130,503.In the past seven days, the number of deaths within 28 days of people testing positive for Covid-19 has risen by 14.8%. The rise in fatalities could worry the authorities as they are counting on the high rate of vaccination coverage to reduce hospitalisations and deaths.Over 75% of Britain’s adult population has already been fully vaccinated against the virus but the spread of the Delta variant, which now accounts for more than 99% of Covid-19 cases across the UK, has caused renewed concerns. Early findings by Public Health England (PHE) suggest that fully vaccinated people may transmit the Delta variant as easily as those who are unvaccinated."Some initial findings ... indicate that levels of virus in those who become infected with Delta having already been vaccinated may be similar to levels found in unvaccinated people," PHE stated.With 23,510 new Covid-19 cases reported on Tuesday, the number of daily infections has been witnessing a decline. The cumulative cases for the last seven days, however, is up by 7.4% from the previous week. The UK has administered a total of 86,780,455 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, with 39,688,566 people receiving both doses, according to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).“This is a huge national achievement, which we should all be proud of. It’s so important that those who haven’t been vaccinated come forward as soon as possible to book their jab - to protect themselves, protect their loved ones and allow us all to enjoy our freedoms safely,” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-reports-biggest-daily-covid-19-deaths-since-march-even-as-75-adults-fully-vaccinated-101628615597218.html
10-08-2021||World||New York Governor Andrew Cuomo resigns after sexual harassment findings||New York Governor Andrew Cuomo resigned on Tuesday following an inquiry that found he sexually harassed 11 women, mounting legal pressure and demands for his departure by President Joe Biden and others, a startling downfall for a man once seen as a possible U.S. presidential contender.Cuomo, a Democrat who had served since 2011 as governor of the fourth most-populous U.S. state, made the announcement after New York Attorney General Letitia James on Aug. 3 released the results of a five-month independent investigation that concluded he had engaged in conduct that violated U.S. and state laws.The investigation, detailed in a 168-page report, found that Cuomo groped, kissed or made suggestive comments to women including current and former government workers - one a state trooper - and retaliated against at least one woman who accused him of sexual misconduct. Cuomo denied wrongdoing.Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat from western New York, will take over as governor of the state of more than 19 million people until the end of Cuomo's term in December 2022 as outlined in the state's constitution, becoming the first woman to hold the post.Cuomo's resignation marks the second time in 13 years that a New York governor has stepped down in scandal, after Eliot Spitzer quit in 2008 over his patronage of prostitutes. Cuomo also became the latest powerful man taken down in recent years following the rise of the #MeToo social movement against sexual abuse and harassment that has shaken politics, Hollywood, the business world and the workplace.His resignation spared Cuomo from possible removal from office through impeachment proceedings in the state legislature. An ongoing impeachment investigation had only promised to intensify.Cuomo, 63, was elected to three terms as governor, as was his late father, Mario Cuomo. He previously served as U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development secretary from 1997 to 2001 under former President Bill Clinton.Like his father, Andrew Cuomo never ran for president despite speculation about his possible national ambitions. He gained national prominence last year early in the COVID-19 pandemic after delivering daily news conferences as his state became the U.S. epicenter of the public health crisis.The civil investigation found that the actions of Cuomo and his senior advisers violated multiple state and federal laws, but James did not pursue criminal charges. Local prosecutors are free to do so, meaning Cuomo still could face legal jeopardy.Local prosecutors in Manhattan, Nassau County, Albany County and Westchester County said after the report's release that they are looking into the matter and have requested evidence from the independent inquiry. New York City's mayor said Cuomo should face criminal charges.Cuomo had for months denied mounting allegations of sexual harassment - and renewed those denials after the investigative report was issued. But what was left of his political support crumbled after the findings were made public. Hours later, Biden - a friend of the governor for years - told reporters at the White House: "I think he should resign."Other prominent Democrats including the state's two U.S. senators, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, and U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi also lined up in calling on the party's one-time star to resign.Investigators concluded that Cuomo and his aides created a "toxic" and "hostile" workplace in an office gripped by bullying, fear and intimidation. The complaints about sexual harassment emerged after broader criticism by Democratic politicians in New York that Cuomo governed through intimidation.Cuomo last year appeared to be a politician in ascent, presenting himself as an authoritative figure in televised news conferences on the pandemic. His image was burnished by television interviews with his younger brother, CNN host Chris Cuomo.Shortly after James, a fellow Democrat, detailed the findings, Cuomo, the divorced father of three adult daughters, issued a video statement in which he said, "I never touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate sexual advances.""That is just not who I am," Cuomo said in the video, as he argued that what women described as sexual advances were inoffensive gestures and comments inspired by a natural physical warmth arising from the culture in which he was raised. In the video, he indicated he had no plans to resign, mentioning specifically the fight against the pandemic.A Marist Poll released a day after the report was issued showed that 59% of New Yorkers wanted Cuomo to resign, compared to 32% who said he should serve out his term and 9% who were unsure. Among Democrats, however, only 52% favored resignation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-governor-andrew-cuomo-resigns-after-sexual-harassment-findings-101628611934842.html
10-08-2021||World||US Senate passes Biden's $1 trillion infrastructure bill||A $1 trillion infrastructure package that is a top priority for U.S. President Joe Biden secured enough votes to pass in the Senate on Tuesday, a bipartisan victory for the White House as it aims to provide the nation's biggest investment in decades in roads, bridges, airports and waterways.Voting was continuing in the 100-seat chamber after the measure secured the 50 votes needed for passage.Polls show that the drive to upgrade America's infrastructure, hammered out by a bipartisan group of senators over months of negotiations, is broadly popular with the public.The bill still has to go to the House of Representatives and the spirit of cooperation in Congress that led to its passage on Tuesday will likely prove fleeting.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer aims to follow the bill with a budget resolution laying the groundwork for $3.5 trillion to be spent on healthcare, climate change and other Biden priorities that Democrats will almost certainly have to pass over Republican objections in a maneuver known as "budget reconciliation."Once the resolution is adopted, Democrats will begin crafting the reconciliation package for a vote on passage after they return from their summer break in September.Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said repeatedly that her chamber will not take up either bill until she has both in hand, meaning that months of work remain before Tuesday's measure would go to Biden's desk to be signed into law.The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office on Thursday said the infrastructure bill would increase federal budget deficits by $256 billion over 10 years -- an assessment rejected by negotiators who said the CBO was undercounting how much revenue it would generate.After working for two consecutive weekends on the infrastructure bill, an around-the-clock "vote-a-rama" session could be in store for the Senate starting Tuesday afternoon as it kicks off debate on the larger budget plan.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled that Republicans would try to use the voting sessions to pick off support from moderate Democrats for what he called a "radical" spending package that would create a permanent welfare state and usher in the largest peacetime tax hike in U.S. history."Every single senator will be going on record over and over and over," McConnell added. "We will debate, and we will vote, and we will stand up, and we will be counted, and the people of this country will know exactly which senators fought for them."The budget plan would provide various Senate committees with top-line spending levels for a wide range of federal initiatives, including helping the elderly get home healthcare and more families afford early childhood education.It also would provide tuition-free community college and foster major investments in programs to significantly reduce carbon emissions blamed for climate change.Later, Senate committees would have to fill in the details for scores of federal programs.The budget blueprint was formally unveiled on Monday, the same day a U.N. climate panel warned that global warming was reaching emergency levels, or what U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described as a "code red for humanity."Senate passage of the infrastructure bill and the budget plan would clear the way for it to begin a month-long summer break.When Congress returns in September, it will not only debate the large investment measures but have to fund government activities for the fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1, increase Washington's borrowing authority and possibly try to pass a voting reform bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-passes-biden-s-1-trillion-infrastructure-bill-101628610326797.html
10-08-2021||World||Moderna to start local production of Covid-19 mRNA vaccine in Canada||Moderna Inc said on Tuesday it had agreed with the Canadian government to start domestic production of mRNA vaccines as the country looks to boost supplies to fight respiratory viruses, including Covid-19 and seasonal influenza.Under the memorandum of understanding, Moderna will set up an mRNA vaccine manufacturing facility in Canada and also give access to its mRNA development engine.The Covid-19 vaccine from Moderna, based on mRNA technology, is already being used in the United States, the European Union, and Canada.Scientists believe mRNA has the potential to target diseases that cannot be reached by conventional drugs. Such vaccines, which have shown high efficacy in preventing Covid-19 disease, contain no actual virus, instead providing instructions for human cells to make proteins that mimic part of the coronavirus.Last week, Moderna said its Covid-19 shot was about 93% effective through six months after the second dose, showing hardly any change from the 94% efficacy reported in its original clinical trial.Canada has reported 1.4 million infections and 26,678 coronavirus-related deaths since the pandemic began, according to Reuters tally.The manufacturing facility is expected to be activated on an urgent basis to support Canada with direct access to rapid pandemic response capabilities, Moderna said on Tuesday, adding that it is in talks with other governments about potential collaborations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-to-start-local-production-of-covid-19-mrna-vaccine-in-canada-101628605377763.html
10-08-2021||World||US vows to isolate Taliban if they take power by force||A U.S. peace envoy brought a warning to the Taliban on Tuesday that any government that comes to power through force in Afghanistan won’t be recognized internationally after a series of cities fell to the insurgent group in stunningly quick succession.Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. envoy, traveled to Doha, Qatar, where the Taliban maintain a political office, to tell the group that there was no point in pursuing victory on the battlefield because a military takeover of Kabul would guarantee they will be global pariahs. He and others hope to persuade Taliban leaders to return to peace talks with the Afghan government as American and NATO forces finish their pullout from the country.The insurgents have captured five out of 34 provincial capitals in the country in less than a week. They are now battling the Western-backed government for control of several others, including Lashkar Gah in Helmand, and Kandahar and Farah in provinces of the same names.After a 20-year Western military mission and billions of dollars spent training and shoring up Afghan forces, many are at odds to explain why the regular forces have collapsed, fleeing the battle sometimes by the hundreds. The fighting has fallen largely to small groups of elite forces and the Afghan air force.The success of the Taliban blitz has added urgency to the need to restart the long-stalled talks that could end the fighting and move Afghanistan toward an inclusive interim administration.The new pressure from Khalilzad follows condemnations from the international community and a similar warning from the United Nations that a Taliban government that takes power by force would not be recognized. The insurgents have so far refused to return to the negotiating table.Khalilzad's mission in Qatar is to “help formulate a joint international response to the rapidly deteriorating situation in Afghanistan,” according to the U.S. State Department.He plans to “press the Taliban to stop their military offensive and to negotiate a political settlement, which is the only path to stability and development in Afghanistan,” the State Department said.Meanwhile, the Taliban military chief released an audio message to his fighters on Tuesday, ordering them not to harm Afghan forces and government officials in territories they conquer. The recording was shared on Twitter by the Taliban spokesman in Doha, Mohammad Naim.In the nearly five-minute audio, Mohammad Yaqoob, the son of late Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar, also told the insurgents to stay out of abandoned homes of government and security officials who have fled, leave marketplaces open and protect places of business, including banks.It was not immediately clear if Taliban fighters on the ground would heed Yaqoob's instructions. There have been reports by civilians who have fled Taliban advances of heavy-handed treatment by the insurgents — schools being burned down and repressive restrictions on women.There have also been reports of revenge killings in areas where the Taliban have gained control, and the insurgents have claimed responsibility for killing a comedian in southern Kandahar, assassinating the government's media chief Kabul and a bombing that targeted acting Defense Minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi, killing eight and wounding more. The minister was not harmed in the attack.The intensifying war has also increased the number of civilian casualties.The International Committee of the Red Cross said that its staff has treated more than 4,000 Afghans this month in their 15 facilities across the country, including in Helmand and Kandahar, where Afghan and U.S. airstrikes are trying to rein in the Taliban onslaught.“We are seeing homes destroyed, medical staff and patients put at tremendous risk, and hospitals, electricity and water infrastructure damaged,” Eloi Fillion, ICRC’s head of delegation in Afghanistan, said in a statement.“The use of explosive weaponry in cities is having an indiscriminate impact on the population," Fillion added. “Many families have no option but to flee in search of a safer place. This must stop.”The surge in Taliban attacks began in April, when the U.S. and NATO announced they would end their military presence and bring the last of their troops home. The final date of the withdrawal is Aug. 31, but the U.S. Central Command has said the pullout is already 95% complete.On Monday, the U.S. emphasized that the Biden administration now sees the fight as one for Afghan political and military leaders to win or lose — and showed no sign of stepping up airstrikes despite the accelerating Taliban gains.“When we look back, it’s going to come down to leadership and what leadership was demonstrated, or not” by Afghans, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said at a Pentagon news conference. “It’s their country to defend now. It’s their struggle.”Khalilzad, the architect of the peace deal the Trump administration brokered with the Taliban, was expected to hold talks with key regional players, as well as unspecified multilateral organizations to see how to restart talks and halt the Taliban onslaught.The U.S. envoy will also likely seek a commitment from Afghanistan’s neighbors and the region not to recognize a Taliban government that comes to power by force. When the Taliban last ruled Afghanistan, three countries recognized their rule: Pakistan, Saudi Arabi and the United Arab Emirates.Senior Afghan officials have also travelled to Doha, including Abdullah Abdullah, who heads the government's reconciliation council. Pakistan's national security adviser, Moeed Yusuf, on Monday called for “reinvigorated” efforts to get all sides in the conflict back to talks, describing a protracted war in Afghanistan as a “nightmare scenario” for Pakistan.Yusuf, speaking to foreign journalists in Islamabad, refused to definitively say whether Pakistan, which holds considerable sway over the Taliban, would recognize a Taliban government installed by force, saying instead that Pakistan wants to see an "inclusive" government in Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-vows-to-isolate-taliban-if-they-take-power-by-force-101628596184801.html
10-08-2021||World||China punishes dozens of officials over Delta variant outbreak||China has punished dozens of officials for failing to control the highly contagious Delta variant of coronavirus, according to a CNN report, as the country is witnessing its most serious virus outbreak in months. The current Covid-19 outbreak in China has sparked local lockdowns, mass testing and travel restrictions after an original Delta cluster was detected in Nanjing city.At least 47 Chinese officials have been punished for negligence over the Delta outbreak which has now spread to 31 provinces, reported CNN citing official statements and state media. The officials facing punishments reportedly include the head of local governments, health commissions, and staff at hospitals and airports.In Nanjing alone, 15 officials have been held accountable for allowing Covid-19 transmission at the city’s Lukou International Airport which was busy handling hundreds of summer tourists, according to the Community Party’s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI). Lukou International Airport is believed to be the place where the Delta outbreak started after nine cleaners tested positive for Covid-19.The officials held accountable for ineffective epidemic prevention at Nanjing Lukou International Airport include the city’s deputy mayor and secretary and director of the Nanjing Municipal Health Commission. The city of Yangzhou has also become a Covid hotspot after a cluster of 34 new Covid-19 cases were reported on Tuesday.China was largely successful in containing the virus outbreak within its borders during the early days of the pandemic but the Delta outbreak has threatened the gains. On Tuesday, Chinese health authorities reported 143 new Covid-19 cases, of which 108 were locally transmitted. The latest daily infections are the highest since January when China reported 144 new cases and 126 domestic infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-punishes-dozens-of-officials-over-delta-variant-outbreak-101628604839884.html

10-08-2021||World||Afghan residents stay off streets, hide in homes as Taliban march towards Mazar-e-Sharif||Residents of northern Afghanistan hid in their homes as Taliban fighters were strengthening their march towards the region’s biggest city Mazar-e-Sharif, news agency Reuters reported on Tuesday. The Islamic extremist group captured Aibak, capital of Samangan province, on Monday after meeting with minimal resistance. With this, as many as six provincial capitals have been captured by the group, government officials and Taliban fighters themselves have confirmed.In the wake of the US taking back their troops from the country after two decades, President Ashraf Ghani called on regional strongmen to support his government.Taliban fighters were tightening their capture in Aibak on the main road between Mazar-e-Sharif and the national capital, Kabul, by moving into government buildings, Reuters reported citing residents.The civilians further said that a majority of the government security force members appeared to have withdrawn before the rapidly marching Taliban.Talking about living conditions in Aibak, Sher Mohamed Abbas, a provincial tax officer, said that the only way is “self-imposed house arrest or to find a way to leave for Kabul.”The father of four children, however, told Reuters that Kabul is also “not safe anymore.”Abbas further stated that Taliban fighters had come to his office, and told workers to go home. However, both he and other residents said that they hadn’t seen nor heard fighting on Tuesday.Security forces in Pul-e-Khumri, to the southeast of Aibak, were engulfed when Taliban fighters closed in on the town from the primary junction on the road to Kabul, an official said.Meanwhile, Gulam Bahauddin Jailani, head of the national disaster authority, said that fighting between Taliban fighters and Afghan army was underway in 24 of the 34 provinces, and 60,000 families had been displaced over the last two months – with a majority of them seeking refuge in Kabul.Meanwhile, India on Tuesday commenced an evacuation process for its diplomats and nationals from Mazar-e-Sharif. “A special flight is leaving from Mazar-e-Sharif to New Delhi.

10-08-2021||World||China demands Lithuania recall its envoy to Beijing over Taiwan controversy||China on Tuesday said it has demanded that Lithuania recall its Beijing envoy and announced it was withdrawing its own ambassador from the Baltic country following a row over Vilnius allowing China-claimed Taiwan to open a diplomatic office in the country.China claims self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory and expresses displeasure if countries around the world establish official ties with the island.Taiwan announced the new mission in Lithuania last month, with its foreign ministry saying it would be called the Taiwanese Representative Office in Lithuania.It would be the first time the island’s name has been used for one of its offices in Europe.The de facto Taiwanese embassy in New Delhi, for example, is called the Taipei Economic and Cultural Centre in India.Only 15 countries have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.In a strongly-worded statement on Lithuania’s decision, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Tuesday that Vilnius has violated the “one-China” policy. Lithuania’s allowing the office to open under the name of Taiwan was done so “in disregard of China’s repeated representations and articulation of potential consequences”, and severely undermines China’s sovereignty, the ministry said. “The Chinese government expresses its categorical opposition to this move. China has decided to recall its ambassador to Lithuania and demanded the Lithuanian government recall its ambassador to China,” the statement added.As a result, Beijing will recall ambassador Shen Zhifei, while the European nation would have to withdraw its ambassador to China, Diana Mickeviciene.“The Chinese side warns the Lithuanian side that there is only one China in the world and the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China,” the statement said. “We urge the Lithuanian side to immediately rectify its wrong decision, take concrete measures to undo the damage, and not to move further down the wrong path.”The foreign ministry also warned Taiwan about furthering “Taiwan independence” through diplomacy. “We also warn the Taiwan authorities that ‘Taiwan independence’ is a dead end and any attempt at separatist activities in the international arena is doomed to fail.”Lithuania said earlier this year it planned to open its own representative office in Taiwan, and has donated 20,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses to the island, Reuters reported.Last week, China “expressed firm opposition” to the US state department’s approval of an arms sale to Taiwan, and lodged “solemn representations” with Washington following the Joe Biden administration’s decision to sell arms to Taiwan.China will take legitimate and necessary counter-measures in light of the development of the situation, the Chinese foreign ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-demands-lithuania-recall-its-envoy-to-beijing-over-taiwan-controversy-101628597541329.html

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said that Austin and Bajwa also discussed regional security issues and the bilateral defence ties along with the current situation in Afghanistan. Austin said that the US is interested in improving the US-Pakistan relationship.“Secretary Austin and General Bajwa discussed the ongoing situation in Afghanistan, regional security and stability, and the bilateral defence relationship more broadly,” Kirby was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. He said the US does not feel ‘bashful’ to discuss the safe havens along the border with Pakistan’s leadership.“We are also mindful that Pakistan and the Pakistani people also fall victim to terrorist activities that emanate from that region. So, we all have a shared sense of the importance of closing down those safe havens and not allowing them to be used by the Taliban or other terrorist networks to sow discord,” Kirby further added. He said that the US continues to continually raise issues related to the safe havens with the Pakistan leadership.Afghanistan continues to allege that Islamabad is aiding Taliban terrorists and is also sending thousands of terrorists to the country to destabilise the government. Pakistan continues to deny any such role while highlighting that it is due to Islamabad’s efforts Taliban has sat down with the US and Afghanistan to talk peace and stability.The US, however, has not made any changes to its troop withdrawal plans which has provided a fillip to the Taliban which is advancing at a fast pace and has captured several major cities and provinces in the conflict-ridden nation. Despite being on the peace committee, where the US and the Afghanistan government are stakeholders, the terrorist group has used violence to stamp its authority and take control of vast regions of Afghanistan. The US and Nato will withdraw all their troops by August 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-asks-pakistan-to-eliminate-taliban-safe-havens-along-afghan-pak-border-101628594963337.html

Top 10 nations with most cases||The rapid spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant of coronavirus has been driving the surge in infections worldwide, with India and the United States being the major contributors. Over four million coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases were reported from July 26 to August 1, which was largely attributed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to a substantial increase in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Western Pacific Regions. But the number of fatalities related to the virus witnessed an 8% decline as compared to the previous week.The highest number of new Covid-19 cases in that week was reported from the United States, followed by India, Indonesia, Brazil, and Iran. According to a Bloomberg report, the US reported 761,216 new infections in the week ended Sunday, the highest total since early February.Among these five nations, Iran has been witnessing a continued surge, with the Islamic Republic recording nearly 41,000 fresh infections on Monday. The cumulative number of Covid-19 cases reported globally exceeded the sombre milestone of 200 million last week.The sustained increase in global Covid-19 cases is driven by the Delta variant first identified in India which has now been reported from 135 countries, as per the UN health agency’s last epidemiological report. While the Alpha variant of coronavirus, first identified in England, has spread to 182 countries, the Delta variant has caused more concerns to authorities given its high transmissibility.Also Read | Hospitals overwhelmed again as US reports fresh surge in daily casesUK scientists have already warned that the people vaccinated against Covid-19 may transmit the Delta strain as easily as unvaccinated.

The fact came to light after the Imran Khan government presented data in this regard in the National Assembly, news agency ANI reported.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government presented the data on response to a question asked by the opposition, according to ANI. Shibli Faraz, Pakistan's federal minister for science and technology, said in the House that more than 50 per cent of water obtained from various sources in 20 of the 29 cities of Pakistan was found to be unsafe, ANI.The water quality was tested by the Pakistan Council of Research of Water Resources (PCRWR), said the minister. The water quality in at least three cities - Mirpurkhas and Shaheed Benazirabad in Sindh and Gilgit - was found to be 100 per cent unsafe for drinking, the PCRWR said, according to Dawn.Only Sialkot and Gujarat had sources where water was found to be 100 per cent for drinking, Dawn further reported.Pakistan's water availability has already fallen by 400 per cent since its independence, according to Parliamentary Secretary National Health Services Dr Nausheen Hamid. He said in a report in July that per capita water availability declined from 5,600 cubic metres in 1947 to around 1,038 cubic metres in 2021.Noting that Pakistan was the fifth most populous country in the world, she had said water scarcity was a "very serious threat" that will aggravate by 2025. The parliamentary secretary further highlighted that inadequate supply of water aggravated food security in the country.Geo News recently carried a report on Pakistan's water scarcity, in which experts warned that a famine-like situation may arise in the country. The report also said that rivers have dried up due to low rainfall.In the month of March, a Washington-based magazine, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) placed Pakistan at the third position in the list of countries facing acute water scarcity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/20-cities-in-pakistan-lack-safe-drinking-water-imran-khan-govt-reveals-in-data-101628580475145.html

According to a report by Bloomberg, the new cases in the US rose to 761,216 in the week ended Sunday, the highest total since early February.The fresh surge has been fuelled by the Delta mutation of the coronavirus and most of the positive samples have been found of the unvaccinated people.The death toll has also risen to record levels as it climbed 49% to 3,486 for the same period. It was the biggest weekly increase since December, Bloomberg reported.The US is at the top of the list of the countries worst affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Since the onset of the pandemic, the cases have grown exponentially in the country along with fatalities. The trajectory slowed down after the shift in vaccination drive following the appointment of Joe Biden as the President, making it more organised, expanding the distribution to maximum age groups.So far, more than 616,800 Americans have succumbed to the viral infection that targets the immunity system of the body. The number of total infections stands at 35,948,131, the John Hopkins' tally showed.Following the surge, Oregon along with other states reimplemented face mask norms. Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Monday said that he will not repeal his emergency order banning local governments from requiring mask use and social distancing.

10-08-2021||World||Guinea confirms first case of Marburg disease: All you need to know||Officials in Guinea, in western Africa, have confirmed a case of the Marburg disease, news agency AFP has reported quoting the World Health Organization (WHO). This makes it the first recorded case of the deadly Ebola-related disease in the region.The development comes just two months after the WHO announced the end of the country’s second outbreak of Ebola. “The potential for the Marburg virus to spread far and wide means we need to stop it in its tracks. We are working with the health authorities to implement a swift response that builds on Guinea’s past experience with Ebola, which is transmitted in a similar way,” Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO’s regional director for Africa, said.Here’s all you need to know about Marburg virus:(1.) As per WHO, Marburg is caused by a virus which comes from the same family (Filoviridae or filovirus) as the virus which leads to Ebola disease. It causes hemorrhagic fever, and has a high fatality rate of 88%.(2.) Marburg virus shares its name with the German town of Marburg, which was the site of an outbreak in 1967, which led to the recognition of the disease. Frankfurt, also in Germany, as well as Belgrade, in present day Serbia, also witnessed outbreaks in the same year.(3.) Humans catch this infection mainly through prolonged exposure to mines or caves inhabited by Rousettus bats. Once an individual contracts the virus, it can transmit to others via direct contact with the blood, secretions, bodily fluids of infected people, as well as through surfaces and materials contaminated with such fluids.(4.) Symptoms of the Marburg disease include high fever, severe headache, muscle aches, pains, severe watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain, cramping, nausea and vomiting. Diarrhoea can go on for a week.(5.) As per both WHO and the US CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), currently, there is no approved vaccine or antiviral drug for this disease. However, supportive care therapy, such as rehydration with oral fluids, may ne helpful.(6.) Previously, cases of Marburg virus in Africa have been reported from Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, South Africa and Uganda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/guinea-confirms-first-case-of-marburg-disease-all-you-need-to-know-101628576356069.html
10-08-2021||World||Chinese court upholds Canadian prisoner’s death sentence, escalating tensions||In an escalation of tensions between Beijing and Ottawa, a Chinese court has upheld the death sentence of Robert Schellenberg, a Canadian national, just days before the crucial extradition hearing of Chinese telecom giant Huawei’s CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver. Canada has slammed the death sentence as “arbitrary”.A court in Liaoning province upheld Schellenberg’s death sentence on charges related to drug smuggling. He was originally sentenced to 15 years in prison, but it was changed to capital punishment in January 2019, weeks after Meng was arrested in Vancouver on charges of attempted fraud.Schellenberg was detained by Chinese authorities in December 2014, charged with drug smuggling in January 2015, and sent to jail for 15 years on November 28, 2018.“The facts found in the first trial were clear, the evidence was reliable and sufficient, the conviction was accurate, the sentence was appropriate, and the trial procedures were legal,” the verdict said. In his first trial, he was sentenced for smuggling 222.035kg of meth.Meng’s hearing in a British Columbia court over her proposed extradition to the US, as sought by Washington, is expected to be completed on August 20. In statement reacting to the Schellenberg verdict, Canada’s foreign minister Marc Garneau said Canada “strongly condemns” the decision, opposes the death penalty, and condemns “the arbitrary nature” of the sentence.“We have repeatedly expressed to China our firm opposition to this cruel and inhumane punishment and will continue to engage with Chinese officials at the highest levels to grant clemency to Mr. Schellenberg,” Garneau said.Stating that Global Affairs Canada, the country’s foreign ministry, will continue to provide to Schellenberg and his family, Garneau thanked Australia, France, Germany and the US as their representatives were present at the court along with Canadian officials.Beijing has also formally charged two Canadians, ex-diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, with spying since the diplomatic hostilities began.The verdict for one, Spavor, is expected to be out on Wednesday, an anonymous Canadian source directly familiar with the matter told Reuters. A second source familiar with the matter confirmed Spavor’s verdict is due this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-court-upholds-canadian-prisoner-s-death-sentence-escalating-tensions-101628573779595.html
10-08-2021||World||US and China clash over South China Sea disputes at UN Security Council meeting||The United States and China clashed over Beijing’s actions in the South China Sea at a high-level UN Security Council meeting on maritime security Monday that also put a spotlight on attacks on ships in the Persian Gulf, piracy in the Gulf of Guinea, and drug and human trafficking in the Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose country holds the council presidency this month and chaired the virtual meeting, warned that the world’s oceans and seas which are the common heritage of all nations and peoples are facing various threats. He pointed to piracy and terrorism, the erection of trade barriers by some countries, and challenges from climate change and natural disasters.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken responded to China’s increasingly assertive claims to parts of the South China Sea, despite the ruling of an international tribunal five years ago rejecting its claims, by warning that conflict there or in any ocean “would have serious global consequences for security and for commerce.”“In the South China Sea, we’ve seen dangerous encounters between vessels at sea and provocative actions to advance unlawful maritime claims,” he said. “The United States has been clear its concerns regarding actions to intimidate and bully other states lawfully accessing their maritime resources.”In the latest incident last month, China’s military said it chased a US warship from an area that it claims in the South China Sea, a statement the US Navy called false.Blinken stressed that it is “the business, and even more the responsibility,” of the United States and all other countries “to defend the rules that we’ve all agreed to follow, and peacefully resolve maritime disputes.”China’s deputy ambassador, Dai Bing, shot back by accusing the United States of becoming “the biggest threat to peace and stability in the South China Sea” and calling its “hype” in the Security Council “entirely politically motivated.”He called the arbitration tribunal’s award to the Philippines “invalid and without any binding force,” claiming that “there were obvious errors in the determination of facts.”The situation in the South China Sea is generally stable, he said, and Beijing is striving to reach a code of conduct for the sea with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations.Dai also said the US “has no credibility on maritime issues” because it isn’t a party to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which defines the rights and responsibilities of nations in their use of the world’s oceans. The US has not ratified the convention, which came into effect in 1994, but has said it recognises the treaty as part of international customary law.Blinken told the council that when any country faces no consequences for unlawful maritime activities “it fuels greater impunity and instability everywhere.”Elsewhere, he said, countries “are also provocatively and unlawfully advancing their interests,” pointing to Iranian actions in the Persian Gulf and Russia’s in Ukraine’s internationally recognized territorial waters in the Black Sea, Kerch straits and Sea of Azov.Blinken said Washington is ”confident” that Iran attacked the Mercer oil tanker on July 29 off Oman using explosive drones, killing a Briton and Romanian. This is “part of a pattern of attacks and other provocative behavior” by Tehran that “threaten freedom of navigation through this crucial waterway, international shipping and commerce, and the lives of people on the vessels onboard,” he said.He was also sharply critical of Russia, which has worked steadily to bolster its zone of control around Ukraine's Crimea peninsula since it annexed it in 2014. “We see continued aggressive actions against Ukraine, with dangerous incursions on the sea and in the air and harassment of vessels which are disrupting commerce and energy access,” he said.Modi called for removal of barriers to legitimate maritime trade that threaten the world economy, resolving maritime disputes peacefully, and jointly fighting maritime threats from cyclones, tsunamis, pollution, piracy and over-fishing.Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a very rare Security Council appearance, called for “peaceful and responsible uses of maritime spaces” and said that as a leading maritime power his country “is doing a lot to maintain and strengthen international rule of law in maritime security.”“We aim to help ensure security in the area of the Persian Gulf, in the Gulf of Guinea, in the Atlantic Ocean where we have seen a growing number of maritime robberies and hostage-taking,” he said. “This situation is aggravated by the fact that some countries cannot fight against trans-national crime syndicates, pirates and terrorists on their own.”Putin, who spoke before Blinken and made no mention of Crimea, proposed establishing “a special structure within the UN system” to deal directly with fighting maritime crime in various regions. He said it should engage experts, civil society representatives, academia and the private sector.Ghada Waly, director-general of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, told the council that the time-honored freedom of navigation “has come increasingly under threat.”She cited “acute challenges” from piracy, armed robbery, terrorism and trafficking in drugs, humans, waste, nuclear materials and firearms as well as illegal fishing and unlawful damage to the marine environment. She also warned of the “critical vulnerability" of submarine cables carrying the world's internet traffic.She said record shipments of cocaine were seized in European ports during the pandemic according to her office’s 2021 World Drug Report.As for piracy, Waly said 90% of kidnapping incidents have occurred in the Gulf of Guinea, where a new study found that “some six pirate groups, with 30 to 50 members each," can now attack in deeper waters, mainly targeting international vessels to kidnap crew members for ransom.The pirates' combined income has been estimated at some $4 million per year, but the economic impact has been estimated around $800 million, she said. The first half of 2020 saw a 20% increase in piracy and armed robbery incidents against ships compared to the same period in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-and-china-clash-over-south-china-sea-disputes-at-un-security-council-meeting-101628563844164.html
10-08-2021||World||Japan’s Yoshihide Suga gets no Olympics boost as he heads into election||Support for Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga fell to new lows in three media polls, showing the Tokyo Olympics did little to shore up his approval ahead of a general election that must be held by the end of November.Suga’s initially high support was hit by disapproval of his handling of the pandemic, with the current wave of infections bringing case numbers to their worst levels yet, though death rates remain relatively low. A slow start to vaccinations means less than one-third of the population is fully immunized.A survey by the Yomiuri newspaper carried out between Aug. 7-9 found support for Suga’s cabinet at 35%, the lowest since he took office in September. A separate survey by broadcaster JNN put support at 32.6%, also a fresh low, while a third poll published by the Asahi newspaper found support had tumbled below 30%, often cited as crisis level for Japanese leaders.Much of the public opposed Suga’s decision to press ahead with staging the games, amid fears it could become a super-spreader event. Relatively few cases were directly linked to the Olympics, which ended Sunday, although experts said the event may have prompted a more relaxed attitude toward virus precautions, and thus worsened the spread.Olympics a Hit for Japan Athletes, Not for Its LeaderMore than 60% of respondents to the JNN survey said they disapproved of Suga’s handling of the coronavirus, and a similar number said they didn’t agree with a new policy of hospitalizing only serious cases and those at risk of suffering serious symptoms. Some 84 people were found to have died of the virus at home in the first six months of this year, NHK reported.Japan PM’s Plan to Have Mild Virus Cases Stay Home Sparks AngerWhile 60% of respondents to the JNN survey said they believed the Olympics had led to an increase in Covid cases, a majority of respondents to all three polls said they were glad the Olympics had gone ahead.Initially elected to take over the last year of Shinzo Abe’s term as leader of the Liberal Democratic Party following his resignation last year, Suga must win his own term as party president in a vote due next month. Two-thirds of respondents to the Yomiuri survey said the party should pick a different leader, with former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba the most popular choice to take over.While the opposition doesn’t boast the support to oust the long-ruling LDP in the general election, Suga’s unpopularity raises the risk of a loss of seats, potentially undermining his control of the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japans-yoshihide-suga-gets-no-olympics-boost-as-he-heads-into-election-101628562560799.html

According to one diplomat in Kabul, the Taliban has a Quetta Shura or high council and a Miramshah Shura but the most important is the Rawalpindi Shura, reference to the headquarters of ISI, which is the real power behind the Islamist Sunni Pashtun force. "Military capture of Kabul by Taliban will not only give strategic space to Pakistan but also trained terrorist cadre to target their adversaries," said a former Indian foreign secretary.The Taliban have intensified their campaign, capturing five provincial capitals in two days. The latest to fall is Kunduz, the capital of northern Kunduz province. Over the weekend, they took Sar-e-Pul, the headquarters of the northern province of the same name, Zaranj, the capital of western Nimroz province, Sheberghan, the capital of northern Zawzjan province, and Taleqan, the capital of another northern province with the same name in their control.On Monday, the Taliban fighters captured Aybak, capital of the northern province of Samangan. Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province, is also under their control.The Taliban are also targeting Laghman province in east Afghanistan, continuously attacking the area on the border between Abshar Panjshir and Shahin districts. In the west, near the border with Iran, security officials said heavy fighting was under way on the outskirts of Herat. Authorities said that 36 people had been killed and 220 wounded over the past 11 days. More than half of the wounded are civilians.Fierce fighting is going on in Badakhshan too. While the Taliban are hell-bent on capturing the province, the Afghan security forces have deployed a new batch of commando special forces in capital city Faizabad to stop the terror group. Afghan army said in a statement that Taliban fighters attacked Faizabad from four directions on Saturday, but fled after facing stiff resistance. The army further said that 35 attackers were killed and 25 others injured in the gunbattle.The Afghan National Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF) said that 579 Taliban terrorists were killed and 161 others were injured in their operations across Afghanistan on Sunday.President Ashraf Ghani has been holding a series of meetings to find a solution to the Taliban problem.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has said that most of the people are fleeing from northeastern and eastern Afghanistan where the insurgent group is concentrating all its energy to capture the areas and re-establish the Islamic Emirate.The terrorists have ramped up their push across much of Afghanistan, turning their guns on provincial capitals after taking large swaths of land in the mostly rural countryside. They are in control of five of the country's 34 provincial capitals.Watch: Meet the woman training fighters against TalibanThe Taliban fighters attacked the Ahmad Shah Abdali Kandahar Airport on Sunday, firing several rockets on the building.

10-08-2021||World||Prince Andrew is sued by Jeffrey Epstein accuser over alleged sexual abuse when she was 17||Britain's Prince Andrew was sued on Monday for having allegedly on three occasions sexually abused a woman who says she was trafficked for sex by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.In a civil complaint filed in the US District Court in Manhattan, Virginia Giuffre said the Duke of York, Queen Elizabeth's second son, sexually assaulted and battered her about two decades ago, when she was 17 and Epstein was also abusing her."I am holding Prince Andrew accountable for what he did to me," Giuffre, previously known as Virginia Roberts, said in a statement."The powerful and rich are not exempt from being held responsible for their actions," she added. "I hope that other victims will see that it is possible not to live in silence and fear, but to reclaim one's life by speaking out and demanding justice."Spokespeople and lawyers for Andrew could not immediately be reached for comment outside business hours.The prince said in a 2019 BBC interview he had no recollection of meeting Giuffre, and categorically denied her claim of sexual abuse.Andrew, 61, is one of the most prominent people linked to Epstein, who Manhattan federal prosecutors charged in July 2019 with sexually exploiting dozens of girls and women.Epstein, a registered sex offender, killed himself at age 66 in a Manhattan jail on Aug. 10, 2019, while awaiting trial.Prosecutors later said Andrew had not cooperated with their probe.Threats AllegedGiuffre has said she was a victim of Epstein's sex trafficking and abuse from 2000 to 2002, starting at age 16.In her complaint, Giuffre said Andrew forced her to have unwanted sexual intercourse at the London home of Epstein's longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite.Giuffre said Andrew also abused her at Epstein's mansion on Manhattan's Upper East Side, and on a private island that Epstein owned in the US Virgin Islands.The complaint said Giuffre "was compelled by express or implied threats" by Epstein, Maxwell or Andrew to engage in sexual acts with Andrew, fearing repercussions for disobedience."Andrew's wealth, power, position, and connections enabled him to abuse a frightened, vulnerable child with no one there to protect her," the complaint said.Giuffre has said Epstein brought her to London to meet Andrew, and kept her as a "sex slave" with help from Maxwell, the daughter of late British media mogul Robert Maxwell.Signed by Giuffre's lawyer David Boies, the complaint accused Andrew of battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. It seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.Lawyers for Ghislaine Maxwell, who is not a defendant in the lawsuit, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Andrew Denied Alleged AbuseIn a November 2019 interview now widely regarded as a public relations disaster, Andrew told the BBC he could not have had sex with Giuffre at Maxwell's home because he had returned that night to his house after a children's party."I can absolutely, categorically tell you it never happened," Andrew said. "I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever."Andrew also called Epstein's behavior "unbecoming," but said he did not regret their friendship.Soon after the interview, Andrew stepped down from royal duties, as charities and other organizations distanced themselves from him.Monday's complaint included a widely circulated photo of Giuffre and Andrew, both smiling, standing next to each other, with Giuffre wearing a pink tank top.Giuffre said the photo was taken at Maxwell's home before Andrew's alleged abuse.Maxwell previously settled a separate civil defamation lawsuit by Giuffre.She has separately pleaded not guilty to engaging in sex trafficking and grooming underage girls for Epstein to abuse. Her trial in Manhattan could begin in November.Giuffre sued Andrew under the Child Victims Act, a New York state law allowing many child abuse victims to pursue claims against their alleged abusers, even if the abuse occurred decades earlier.A window to bring many such claims expires this week.Earlier on Monday, the administrator of a fund to compensate Epstein's victims said she has completed the payout process, giving more than $121 million to about 138 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-andrew-is-sued-by-jeffrey-epstein-accuser-over-alleged-sexual-abuse-when-she-was-17-101628559217412.html

10-08-2021||World||Covid-19: Pentagon seeks vaccine mandate for US troops||The Pentagon on Monday said that it will seek US President Joe Biden’s approval to require military members to get vaccinated against Covid-19 by the middle of September.Biden last month urged local governments to pay people to get vaccinated against Covid-19, and he set new rules requiring federal workers to provide proof of vaccination or face regular testing, mask mandates and travel restrictions.At the time, the American president had directed the Pentagon to look into “how and when” it will require members of the military to take the vaccine. The defence department is targeting mid-September for a vaccination deadline based on expectations for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to give full approval to the Pfizer vaccine. It currently falls under an emergency use authorisation (EUA).“By way of expectation, public reporting suggests the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine could achieve full FDA licensure early next month,” a memo from defence secretary Lloyd Austin said.France’s pass required in restaurants, trainsFrance took a big step on Monday by requiring people to show a QR code proving they have a Covid pass before they can enjoy in restaurants and cafes or travel across the country. The move came amid fierce protests in the country against such passes.The pass is issued to people who are vaccinated against Covid-19, or have proof of a recent recovery from the disease or who have a recent negative Covid-19 test.In China, authorities have punished a slew of officials for failing to curb a Covid-19 outbreak spanning nearly 900 symptomatic infections across the country in less than a month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-pentagon-seeks-vaccine-mandate-for-us-troops-101628556484896.html
