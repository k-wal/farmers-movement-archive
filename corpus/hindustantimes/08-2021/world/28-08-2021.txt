The intensifying hurricane is expected to bring winds as high as 225 kmph to these US coastal areas when it makes landfall on Sunday. The National Weather Service warned that the storm surge can cause major damage to houses and pose a “significant threat for drownings.”“Listen to local officials and evacuate immediately if told to do so. Never drive through water-covered roads,” the US weather agency tweeted.The storm is expected to make landfall on the exact date of Hurricane Katrina landfall which brought devastation to large parts of US coastal areas in 2005. The National Weather Service said that extremely life-threatening flooding of 10 to 15 feet above ground level is possible within the area from Morgan City in Louisiana, to the Mouth of the Mississippi River.Also Read | Hurricane Ida might damage close to 1 million homes along US GulfWhen Ida reaches the coast of Louisiana, it could turn into an extremely dangerous major hurricane, according to weather forecasters, with potentially catastrophic wind damage possible where the core of Ida moves onshore. The hurricane is likely to trigger heavy rainfall from late Sunday to Monday across the central Gulf Coast from southeast Louisiana to coastal Mississippi, resulting in significant flash and riverine flooding impacts.Flooding is possible across portions of the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee valleys when Ida moves inland, the NWS said. The weather agency shared a clip of satellite imagery detailing the centre as an eye of the hurricane begins to form.This is about three hours of satellite imagery over #Ida, each frame only one minute apart and ending at 12:28pm EDT.You can see the incredible detail near the center as an eye begins to form.Keep up with the latest forecast and safety information at https://t.co/Q7hJAcQl89 pic.twitter.com/er5ZHlKlyyWhile hurricane and tropical storm conditions are ending over Cuba, heavy rain across western Cuba is predicted throughout the day today that may lead to flash floods and mudslides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-ida-life-threatening-storm-to-hit-us-gulf-coast-on-katrina-anniversary-101630169817198.html

In a 'retaliatory' attack of the Kabul airport blasts, the US conducted an airstrike early on Saturday in which one ISIS-K planner and a facilitator were killed. The Pentagon confirmed that there was no exchange of information between the US and the Taliban regarding the airstrike. Without explaining a further plan of any attack, the Pentagon said it maintains its ability to defend itself until the end of the withdrawal.The Taliban will soon take full control of the Kabul airport, spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said adding that once the US troops leave, the announcement of a full cabinet will come shortly. He said officials had already been appointed to run key institutions including the ministries of public health and education and the central bank. He also said he expected the serious economic turbulence which has hit the afghani currency to ease soon, Reuters reported,With foreign troops beginning to completely withdraw from Kabul airport, the Taliban once again said that they want to maintain diplomatic ties with the US, the UK and other western nations.Reports said the Taliban have been finalising an inclusive caretaker government accommodating leaders from all ethnicities and tribal backgrounds. The government will also have an "amir-ul momineen", reports said.The group has also asked all women healthcare workers to return to work as the health sector is under immense pressure. "The Ministry of Public Health of the Islamic Emirate advises all women employees in the centre and provinces that they should attend work regularly," a statement from spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said. "They will face no impediment to performing their duties from the Islamic Emirate," he said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/attack-on-afghan-territory-taliban-on-us-airstrike-that-killed-2-isis-k-men-101630169771641.html

We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay,” he said in an address to the nation on Thursday.Asked what ISIS-K assets were destroyed in the drone strike, Kirby said, “They lost a planner, and they lost a facilitator and they’ve got one wounded, and the fact that two of these individuals are no longer walking on the face of the earth, that’s a good thing it’s a good thing for the people of Afghanistan, it’s a good thing for our troops and our forces at that airfield.”Kirby went to say that threats to the Kabul airport and the evacuation process “are still very real, they are very dynamic, and we are monitoring them, literally in real time”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-2-isis-k-operatives-killed-in-drone-strike-in-afghanistan-1-wounded-101630169075630.html
28-08-2021||World||US troops started leaving Kabul airport as withdrawal deadline nears, says Pentagon||The US troops in Afghanistan have begun withdrawing from the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, the Pentagon confirmed on Saturday, as the last date for the complete drawdown of US from Afghanistan, August 31, approaches. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby confirmed the development during a press briefing on the day.Meanwhile, the Taliban has secured the control of three gates at the Kabul airport and some other areas after the US soldiers have left the gates, the group said, according to a report by Afghan news website TOLOnews.Also read | ISIS-K in Afghanistan trying to turn US exit into bloody spectacleThe announcement from the Pentagon came as several countries are eyeing the end of the civilian evacuations from Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover. Earlier in the day, the UK military said that the country would stop the evacuation of civilians and would carry on with bringing back the country’s armed forces. The last flight carrying civilians to Britain departed from Kabul. However, the country’s defence ministry had said that some Afghan civilians would be airlifted along with the British armed forces on the remaining flights.Following the Taliban’s seizure of Kabul, US President Joe Biden has deployed an additional 5,000 troops in the country to secure the international airport. On August 20, Biden also confirmed that close to 6,000 US armed forces were present in Afghanistan to assist in the civilian departure from the country.Approximately 6,800 people were evacuated from Kabul in a 24-hour period ending on Saturday, of whom, 4,000 were carried by 32 US military aircraft and 2,800 were carried by 34 flights belonging to coalition countries, the White House said. “Since August 14, the U.S. has evacuated and facilitated the evacuation of approximately 111,900 people. Since the end of July, we have re-located approximately 117,500 people,” it further said. Nearly 5,000 people were reportedly present inside the Kabul airport awaiting evacuation out of the country.The complete withdrawal of US troops, scheduled to end on August 31, would mark the end of the US’ two-decade-long war in Afghanistan.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-troops-started-leaving-kabul-airport-as-withdrawal-deadline-nears-says-pentagon-101630168392874.html

No civilians were hurt in the strike, it said adding that the US will maintain its ability to defend itself until the end of the withdrawal.On whether there was only one strike that killed those two, Pentagon press secretary John F Kirby said, "There was only one mission and as information came coming in, we found out that two were killed." Based on their past activities, they have been classified as 'high profile', the Pentagon said.Refusing to divulge their names or whether they were directly involved in the Kabul blast, Kirby said, "They were ISIS-K planners and facilitators, which is enough reason. We won't go into the details of their roles."Commenting on the threat level at areas surrounding Kabul airport, the press secretary said, "The threats are still very real and dynamic and we are monitoring them real-time." On Haqqani and Taliban link, the press secretary said, "The focus is on getting more people out. So I am not sure what benefit it does if I break down the characteristic of this groups... there is a certain amount of co-mingling."At least one of the IS planners killed in Saturday's airstrike was known to the United States, CNN has reported earlier as a US official earlier said the target was not believed to be a senior Islamic State militant, without ruling out future action against the group.Reports said that the strike was carried out in a compound in Jalalabad, which is around 150 km away from Kabul. According to a CNN report, surveillance continues on the compound until the target's wife and children left.The strike does not eliminate the threat of the ISIS-K, the Pentagon said clarifying that the situation is dynamic. "The ISIS-K lost one of their planners and facilitators. But we are not saying that we got them..so the threat is over," John said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-high-profile-isis-targets-killed-in-us-strike-claims-pentagon-101630165313533.html

The clashes are taking place in Sanjan in Kapisa province and Khost Wa Fereng district in Baghlan.The resistance forces are, meanwhile, also giving the Taliban a tough fight in Panjshir province, forcing the Sunni Pashtun group to pull back. The counter-attack is a result of violation of ceasefire by the Taliban in Panjshir.Panjshir is the only province not captured by the Taliban, which seized power in Afghanistan earlier this month in the wake of withdrawal of US forces. The counter-attack comes days after terror group Islamic State carried out blasts near the Kabul airport in which more than 150 people, and 13 American soldiers, were killed.After the attacks, Saleh asked the world to unite against terrorism. "The world must not bow to terrorism. Let's not allow Kabul airport to be the site for humiliation of humanity & "rules based world order". Let's believe in our collective effort and energy. Defeatist psyche puts you under risk more than terrorists. Don't die psychologically," he tweeted on Friday.The world must not bow to terrorism.

Defeatist psyche puts you under risk more than terrorists. Don't die psychologically. https://t.co/pVOeheQAKpHe also took on the Taliban for distancing themselves from the Islamic State. Saleh said the Taliban have learnt it from their master Pakistan to deny their links with ISIS.There is still confusion between the factions of Taliban about forming an Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan. According to reports from Afghanistan, the Haqqani network has taken control of the capital city led by Anas Haqqani, brother of Sirajuddin Haqqani, head of the terrorist group and deputy leader of the Taliban. Sirajuddin Haqqani is said to be passing instructions from Quetta.Meanwhile, the Taliban faction headed by Mullah Yaqoob, son of late Mullah Omar and head of Taliban military commission, is eyeing Kandahar, the traditional seat of Pashtuns. Taliban leader Abdul Ghani Barader met Mullah Yaqoob after he arrived from Doha on August 18. It was here in Kandahar that Mullah Yaqoob’s father was declared Emir ul Momeen on April 4, 1996. The religious head of Taliban, Mullah Haibatullah Akundzada, is still based in Karachi in Pakistan.Haqqani network is known as the most radical and violent branch of the Islamist movement. It has perpetrated the deadliest attacks in Afghanistan in the last 20 years. The group was formed by Jalaluddin Haqqani, who was a valuable CIA asset in the 1980s. He later allied with the Taliban and also served as a minister between 1996 and 2001.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heavy-losses-to-taliban-in-kapisa-an-afghan-resistance-counterattacks-101630158901805.html
28-08-2021||World||Why Taliban released only one photo of 'supreme leader' Hibatullah Akhundzada||The Taliban fighters have shed the shell of secrecy and made themselves visible in front of the camera, on social media platforms after their takeover of Afghanistan. However, there is one exception and that is regarding their supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada's whereabouts, news agency AFP reported. In an attempt to track Hibatullah Akhundzada since the fall of Kabul, the news agency found that nothing much is known about it. As the group remains tightlipped about his details, they had only released one photograph of their supreme leader, who never made a public appearance.His day-to-day activities are not known and he only releases an annual message during Islamic holidays. "You will see him soon, God willing," Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told reporters this week when asked about Akhundzada's whereabouts.Who is Hibatullah Akhundzada?Hibatullah Akhundzada is the chief of the group since 2016. The Kandahar leader who was involved in the Islamist resistance during the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan is more reputed as a religious leader than a military commander. He was announced the successor of Akhtar Mohammad Mansour after Mansour was killed in a US drone strike in 2016. It was said that Akhtar Mohammad Mansour wanted Hibatullah Akhundzada to be his successor.Reports said during the previous Taliban rule, Hibatullah Akhundzada was the deputy head of its supreme court and after 2001 following the fall of Taliban in Afghanistan, he became the head of the group's council of religious scholars.Where is Hibatullah Akhundzada?Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid was asked about his whereabouts. His reply was: "You will see him soon, God willing.""Akhundzada's absence follows years of rumours about his health, with chatter in Pakistan and Afghanistan suggesting he had contracted Covid or had been killed in a bombing. There has never been much in the way to prove these rumours, but Akhundzada's secrecy comes at a sensitive time for the erstwhile insurgency," AFP wrote.Why this shroud of secrecyThis is not new for Taliban leadership as most of the top leaders have remained in the shadows for years. Founder Mullah Mohammad Omar was an enigmatic figure who was reluctant to even meet visitors. There might be many reasons for this style and security concerns is one of them. "The Taliban consider themselves in a state of jihad as long as foreign troops are on Afghan soil and will likely keep their leader hidden until they leave. That's why the supreme leader is not surfacing," Pakistan-based security analyst Imtiaz Gul told AFP.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-taliban-released-only-one-photo-of-supreme-leader-hibatullah-akhundzada-101630152254130.html
28-08-2021||World||ISIS-K in Afghanistan trying to turn US exit into bloody spectacle||ISIS-Khorasan, the Islamic State's Afghanistan and Pakistan arm, the group behind the Kabul airport attack is trying to turn the Biden administration's exit into a bloody spectacle.Hannah Allam and Souad Mekhennet, writing in The Washington Post said that for months, terrorism analysts warned that Islamic State-linked terrorists in Afghanistan would try to turn the Biden administration's exit into a bloody spectacle.On Thursday, a suicide bomber and multiple ISIS-K gunmen killed 13 US service members and at least 169 Afghan civilians in the attack at the Kabul airport.With its signature blend of complexity and cruelty, the attack was seen by many observers as a reminder to the Americans and the Taliban that, no matter who was in the presidential palace, Afghanistan would remain contested, said Allam and Mekhennet.Amira Jadoon, an assistant professor at the US Military Academy, has written extensively about ISIS-K, arguing that an unconditional US withdrawal and Taliban takeover would bring about "the most permissive" environment for the group to operate."And this is what we are seeing now," Jadoon said. "ISK's main goal right now is to stay politically relevant, disrupt efforts to stabilize the country, and also undermine the Afghan Taliban's credibility."In the hours before the attack, US and Western governments warned of a specific threat related to ISIS-K and urged people to stay away from the airport. But the crowds returned Thursday, taking their chances before the evacuation window closed for good, reported The Washington Post.In a speech from the White House on Thursday evening, President Biden blamed the Islamic State and addressed the attackers directly: "We will not forgive, we will not forget, we will hunt you down and make you pay."An August 17 US Defense Department report said, "ISIS-Khorasan exploited the political instability and rise in violence" from April through June "by attacking minority sectarian targets and infrastructure to spread fear and highlight the Afghan government's inability to provide adequate security.""The blast at the airport today is showing that unfortunately, a very bloody future is ahead of us," said an Arab intelligence official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to be interviewed, reported The Washington Post.ISIS-K began operating in Afghanistan in 2015, according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Started in 2014 by Pakistani national Hafiz Saeed Khan, who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State's former leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, it was a small band of mostly Pakistani militants operating in the eastern Afghanistan province of Nangarhar.Some recruits came from the Taliban, though members of other extremist groups in the region also defected to the Khorasan group, according to the CSIS report.As with other Islamic State affiliates, ISIS-K has stayed nimble and able to regroup after military blows. The founder died in a US airstrike in 2016, according to CSIS.But, the United Nations estimates that ISIS-K retains a core group of some 1,500 to 2,200 fighters in Afghanistan's Konar and Nangarhar provinces. Smaller cells are scattered across the country, said Allam and Mekhennet.Attacks like the one at the airport are why armed groups are preparing for internecine battles, said an Afghan militant with ties to the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, who spoke on the condition that he be identified only by a nom de guerre, "Abu Muhammad".He also said that the terror attack at Kabul airport was "a punishment also for all those who want to leave Afghanistan to go and live in the West".Jadoon, the US Military Academy academic, and co-author Abdul Sayed reported in March that ISIS-K had claimed responsibility for 47 attacks in the first two months of 2021, comparable to the group's peak years of 2017 and 2018, when it was linked to 100 and 84 attacks, respectively.Jadoon said ISIS-K is probably contemplating a number of ways to take advantage of the fluid situation in Afghanistan right now.She said three areas to watch are the group's efforts to recruit from the Taliban and other terrorist groups, prison-break operations to free fighters and attempts to carve out strongholds in Nangarhar and Konar in order to stop the spread of ISIS-K.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/isisk-in-afghanistan-trying-to-turn-us-exit-into-bloody-spectacle-101630147582883.html
28-08-2021||World||Two die in Japan after getting Moderna vaccine jabs suspended over contamination||As many as two people died in Japan after being administered Moderna Inc’s Covid-19 vaccine jabs that were among the batches later suspended over contamination reports, the country’s health ministry said on Saturday.The deceased people, both men in their 30s, died this month within days of getting inoculated with the second doses of Moderna vaccines, news agency Reuters reported quoting the ministry statement.Each had received a shot from one of the three manufacturing lots of the coronavirus vaccines that were suspended on Thursday. Their deaths are being probed; the Reuters report added. Both had a fever the day after receiving the second dose and died two days following the fever.This development comes after Japan on Thursday suspended the use of a total of 1.63 million doses of Moderna Inc’s coronavirus vaccines – over a week after the domestic distributor, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co, got reports of contamination in some of the vials.However, both Takeda and Moderna insisted on carrying out a “formal investigation” to determine the connection. “At this time, we do not have any evidence that these deaths are caused by the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine,” the companies said in a statement on Saturday.Following the suspension of vaccine doses, both Moderna and Japan said that no efficacy or safety issue had been spotted and that the move was just a precautionary measure.Also Read | Covid-19 deaths worldwide near 4.5mn markWhat Moderna said on the contamination reports?Following the findings by Takeda, Moderna confirmed in a statement of being “notified of cases of particulate matter” being observed in drug product vials of its Covid-19 vaccine.“The company is investigating the reports and remains committed to working expeditiously with its partner, Takeda, and regulators to address this,” Moderna’s statement added.According to Reuters, the US biotechnology and pharmaceutical firm said that the contamination could have been due to a “manufacturing issue” in one of the production lines at its contract manufacturing site in Spain.Rovi, a Spanish pharma company that fills and finishes Moderna Inc’s Covid-19 vaccines for markets apart from the US, said it is probing the “possible contamination” of the doses and that the issue appeared to be present only in a few batches marked for Japan.What’s the situation in Japan now?A health ministry official told Reuters that Takeda first identified the contaminated vials on August 16, and reported the issue to the government on Wednesday. The delay, the official added, occurred as the regional distributor needed time to assemble information regarding the affected vials and the locations they were in the country.The contaminants found in some of the vials are believed to be metallic particles, Japan’s public broadcaster NHK reported, citing health ministry sources."There may only be a temporal relationship between vaccination and death," Fumie Sakamoto, the infection control manager at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo told Reuters, stressing on not drawing conclusions as there are “so many things” yet to be unravelled.Nearly 44 per cent of Japan’s population is fully vaccinated with the country administering more than 124 million jabs. As of August 8, as many as 991 people have lost their lives after receiving Pfizer Inc’s vaccine shots and 11 following the administration of Moderna jabs – however, none of the fatalities have been established to have had connections with the injections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-die-in-japan-after-getting-moderna-vaccine-jabs-suspended-over-contamination-101630147449283.html

The country's chief of the defence staff General Nick Carter said that hundreds of Afghan nationals who are eligible for resettlement in the UK are likely to be left behind.The remarks from the armed forces chief came a day after Britain’s defence minister Ben Wallace on Friday said that the country is entering “the final hours” of its evacuation in Kabul and would only process people who were already inside the airport.Also read | 'Should go back to work': Taliban tells women healthcare workers in AfghanistanWhile Wallace said that an estimated 800 to 1,100 people in Afghanistan, who had worked with the UK would not make it out of Kabul, Carter noted that the total would be in “high hundreds”.“We're reaching the end of the evacuation, which will take place during the course of today, and then of course it'll be necessary to bring our troops out on the remaining aircraft,” BBC quoted the General as saying.“It's gone as well as it could do in the circumstances... but we haven't been able to bring everybody out and that has been heartbreaking and there have been some very challenging judgements that have had to be made on the ground,” he added. However, he also said that people who have not been evacuated but leave Afghanistan through other ways “will always be welcome in Britain.”Late on Friday, the UK’s defence ministry said that more than 14,500 people, including British and Afghan nationals, were airlifted out of Afghanistan in the days following the Taliban takeover of Kabul. The UK had deployed over 1,000 military personnel at the peak of the evacuation operations in securing the Kabul airport. The last date for ceasing operations at the Kabul airport is August 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-evacuations-britain-says-last-civilian-flight-to-depart-today-101630145276810.html
28-08-2021||World||'I can't breathe': Year after George Floyd's death, NBA player faces cop action||More than a year after George Floyd died after a US policemen pressed his knee against his neck, similar incident has been reported from Los Angeles. A body camera video released on Friday showed the neck of NBA player Jaxson Hayes under the knee of a cop as he gasped "I can't breathe".The footage is from July 28, when the cops went to the house of the New Orleans Pelicans center around 3 am following a 911 call from the cousin of Hayes' girlfriend. The cousin said Hayes' girlfriend was sending her text messages saying he had become loud and violent and she was scared.Watch what LAPD says about the incident:The 21-year-old ultimately was booked into jail on accusations of resisting arrest after he was evaluated at a hospital for minor injuries. But the LAPD said in a statement that their Force Investigation Division is looking into the case "due to the possibility of force being applied to Hayes' neck during the use of force"."The LAPD conducts very thorough 'use of force' investigations which typically requires the police officers to interview multiple witnesses and analyse significant amount of forensic evidence. We are still at an early stage of investigation, which can often take upto a year to complete," said Captain Stacy Spell, commanding officer of the media relations division of LAPD, in a video released by the department.This is yet another chilling reminder of the police violence against the Black people on America. Floyd's death last year led to the biggest outcry against racial injustice in the US in generations, and heightened sensitivity about using any kind of force that restricts a person's breathing.Floyd died gasping for air on May 25, 2020, after Derek Chauvin pressed his knee against his neck for up to 9 and a half minutes after being pinned down on the suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill. Chauvin was thrown out of the police force and given 22 and a half years in jail - one of the longest prison terms ever imposed on a US police officer in the killing of a Black person.He was convicted of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.However, there are some difference between what happened with Floyd and Hayes' incident in July. The 6-foot-11 and 220 pounds basketball player was on his back when a Los Angeles police officer’s knee was pressed to his neck for a few seconds. Floyd was pinned face-down under Chauvin’s knee.As Hayes gasped "I can't breathe" several times, another officer tells his partner "get your knee up". That officer immediately complies and Hayes is able to lift his head. In Floyd's case, three other officers were charged with aiding and abetting Chauvin with murder and manslaughter because they did not intervene.The 15-minute-long bodycam video shows how the calm incident rapidly escalated, and Hayes was tased. The officers ultimately handcuffed Hayes and forced him to sit in a chair. The video also showed blood on his arm and shirt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-can-t-breathe-year-after-george-floyd-s-death-nba-player-faces-cop-action-101630143831082.html
28-08-2021||World||Haqqani network is the sword arm of Taliban with Pakistan the common parent||The Biden administration’s Machiavellian approach in white washing the Taliban and call it a separate entity from Haqqani network shows the desperation of US to exit Afghanistan at whatever the cost. State Department spokesperson Ned Price is a spin doctor for the Biden administration, but his statement that the Taliban and Haqqani network are separate entities shows his shallow knowledge of jihadists in Af-Pak region. The fundamental rule of the game is that there are no good terrorists and political Islam is a way to seize power not sermon the believers.While one can understand the reason behind Ned Price’s lie, but if this is the understanding of the State Department then the war against terrorism globally is doomed. The rather feckless administration of Joe Biden may now cover up for sharing list of American evacuees and Special Immigrant Visa holders by drawing this unheard off distinction, but everyone knows that Mullah Omar, the one-eyed founder of the Taliban, was radicalised in Darul Uloom Haqqania in Khyber-Paktunkhwa, from which the Haqqani network derives its name. The Haqqani network is a jihad group incorporated in Pakistan with two of its members, Sirajuddin Haqqani, deputy leader of Taliban, and Khalil Haqqani, the Taliban emissary, carry USD 15 million in reward on their head. Another relative Anas Haqqani is at the center of negotiations among the various factions of Taliban as also with the Panjshiri resistance. Fact is that Kabul is under control of over 6,000 murderous cadre of Haqqani network with Mullah Yaqoob, son of Mullah Omar, playing the second fiddle.While there may be several ideological fault-lines among the various jihadists groups spawned in Pakistan, there is unity among these terrorists when the target is the democratic world. Puritan Islamists describe all these terrorist groups as “Takfirs” as they have no qualms in killing Sunnis what to talk of Shia Kaffirs in pursuance of their political objectives. So the Haqqani network’s logistics support is used by Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) to mount attack on Indian embassy in Kabul just as the so-called Islamic State of Khorasan is used by Pakistani deep state to target Indians in Afghanistan. The Jaish-e-Mohammed under the leadership of Mufti Rauf Azhar operates on both sides of Pakistani border. It fought the US led coalition forces along with the Taliban in southern Afghanistan, while its is part of training camps with Haqqani network across the Khyber Pass. If Ned Price has any difficulty in understanding this, then they should ask UK intelligence, to whom the Americans outsourced the entire Afghan policy due to their legacy relationship with Rawalpindi.Although for Biden administration it really does not matter to find out the umbilical relations between Haqqani etwork and the Taliban after they exit Kabul but the graveyard that is Afghanistan has surely buried another empire after the British and the Soviets. Only time will tell whether US loses power the Soviet way after the 1979 withdrawal (it is called de-induction in military jingo) from Afghanistan or rise yet again after the 1976 Saigon withdrawal. Either way the situation is bleak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/haqqani-network-is-the-sword-arm-of-taliban-with-pakistan-the-common-parent-101630133204796.html

The restrictions were earlier set to end on August 31.Businesses in Metro Manila can operate up to 50 per cent on-site capacity under the restrictions. However, dining-in in restaurants, religious activities, personal care services, bars, beauty parlours will continue to remain closed. The capital region is home to over 13 million people and is currently the Philippines’ Covid-19 epicentre.Meanwhile, the second toughest restrictions on movement were also imposed in nine provinces and six cities, which have been witnessing a massive surge in infections.The Philippines, which is currently one of the worst-hit from Covid-19 across Asia, has so far reported 1,916,461 cases, 32,841 deaths and 1,741,089 recoveries. On Friday, the country recorded another high of 17,447 new cases while 113 patients died and 6,771 recovered from the viral disease, according to the department of health’s (DOH’s) bulletin.The department of health’s epidemiology bureau director Alethea De Guzman said on Thursday that daily cases and deaths were rising in the country, and classified Metro Manila as a “high-risk area”, adding the region will probably see new peaks of new infections in the upcoming days because of the upward Covid-19 trend.On Monday, the DOH said the Delta variant had spread to communities in the capital region and also in the Calabarzon region. Guzman also pointed out on Thursday that the variant has been identified in the country’s 17 regions.On the vaccination front, the government has secured 194.89 million vaccine doses till now, which is sufficient to vaccinate about 100.5 million citizens or over 100 per cent of the country’s adult population, the finance ministry said, adding the government could administer doses to everyone by January 2022.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-extends-covid-curbs-in-capital-region-other-provinces-till-sept-7-101630122903647.html
28-08-2021||World||US intelligence community divided on Covid-19 origin||With US intelligence community (IC) still divided on the origin of the Covid-19 pandemic - whether it started with an animal-to-human infection or lab leak - President Joe Biden on Friday said America will partner with like-minded countries to press China to share information on the issue.“To this day, the PRC (the People’s Republic of China) continues to reject calls for transparency and withhold information, even as the toll of this pandemic continues to rise,” Biden said acknowledging he had received an inconclusive report from the intelligence community.He added: “We must have a full and transparent accounting of this global tragedy. Nothing less is acceptable.”As widely reported earlier, Biden received a report from the intelligence community after 90 days on investigation into the origin of the pandemic, which started in China in November of 2019 but hit the United States the hardest with more than 636,000 deaths, the highest for any country.“After examining all available intelligence reporting and other information … the intelligence community remains divided on the most likely origin of Covid-19,” the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a short two-page summary of their findings. “All agencies assess that two hypotheses are plausible: natural exposure to an infected animal and a laboratory-associated incident,” it added.The summary said four of IC 18 elements and the National Intelligence Council assess with “low confidence” that the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection was most likely caused by natural exposure to an animal infected the virus or something 99% similar. One IC element assessed with “moderate confidence” that the first human infection was caused by a laboratory-associated incident, “probably involving experimentation, animal handling, or sampling by the Wuhan Institute of Virology”.Analysts at three IC elements were unable to rally around either of the two theories without more information and some other said both theories were equally likely.The intelligence community is unable to provide more definitive explanation for the origin unless new information comes along.But here is what the IC can say with some certainty, according to the summary. The first infections occurred no later than November 2019; the first cluster of cases were in Wuhan; the virus “was not developed as a biological weapon”; most agencies assessed with “low confidence” that SARS-CoV-2 probably was not genetically engineered; however, two agencies believe there was not sufficient evidence to make an assessment either way.“Finally, the IC assesses China’s officials did not have foreknowledge of the virus before the initial outbreak of Covid-19 emerged.”The debate over the origin of SARS-CoV-2 has raged around the world especially after former president Donald Trump supported those who argued it emerged from a virology lab in Wuhan city of China, where the epidemic started end of 2019 and then spread rapidly around the world.Trump’s action was motivated by his desire to shift blame of his mishandling of the fightback in the US, but it was also backed by many scientists such as Robert Redfield, former chief of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). He said he believed the coronavirus “most likely” escaped a lab.A WHO report widely seen as unduly accommodative of the Chinese said the virus most likely travelled from animals to humans and that the possibility of a lab leak was “extremely unlikely”.Efforts to conclusively ascertain the origin of the virus that has killed millions of people around the world, causing the largest global public health crisis in 100 years, have been marred by the lack transparency and cooperation by China, as Biden pointed out in the White House statement.The US intelligence community was divided as well. Biden had said in May that two agencies believed in the animal-to-human theory and a third agency went with the lab-leak possibility.“The majority of elements do not believe there is sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other,” the US president had said then.The intelligence community is still there, 90 days hence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-intelligence-community-divided-on-covid-19-origin-101630126953590.html

The Kabul airport suicide bombing death figures are nearing 200, including 13 US soldiers.According to reports reaching from Afghanistan, Kabul is in control of the Haqqani Network as the Zadran Pashtuns are traditionally dominant on the Jalalabad-Kabul axis with the tribe dominant in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province bordering Pakistan. ISKP is also active in the Nangarhar province and has operated with Haqqani Network in the past.It is understood that one out of the 14 Keralites contacted his home in the southern state, while the remaining 13 are still at large in Kabul with the ISKP terrorist group. After the so-called Islamic State of Syria and Levant occupied Mosul in 2014, batches of Keralites from the Malappuram, Kasaragod and Kannur districts left India to escape the land of Kafirs and join the jihadist group in the Middle East. Out of this, some families came down to Nangarhar province in Afghanistan to settle under the ISKP.Also read | US hits back at ISIS-K, 'kills' terrorist planner in drone strike in AfghanistanWhile India is worried that the Taliban and their handlers will use these radicalised Keralites to besmirch Indian reputation by indulging in acts of terror in Afghanistan, there are very credible reports coming about the detention of two Pakistanis who were trying to conduct a blast outside the Turkmenistan embassy. The Taliban are for obvious reasons tight-lipped about the entire incident but intelligence reports indicate that an improvised explosive device was recovered from these Pakistani nationals soon after the Kabul airport blast on August 26. Given that Pakistan along with the UK was involved in the US cutting out a deal with the Taliban, the incident appears to have been drowned in the mayhem after the airport attack. HT online has no independent means of confirmation.Also read | Kabul attack killed 13 US troops, many of them in 20s. Here are their storiesThe situation in Kabul is very fluid with Pakistan with the help of the Haqqani Network putting pressure on the Taliban to form a 12 member council with elements of the previous regime with the aim of getting global legitimacy, but the Mullah Yaqoob faction is reluctant. The neighbouring countries of Afghanistan are waiting for the US to exit from the Islamic Emirates on August 31 before any decision on its relationship with the Taliban is considered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/14-keralites-with-iskp-blast-outside-turkmenistan-mission-in-kabul-foiled-101630120774066.html
28-08-2021||World||Joe Biden criticizes China for not aiding report on coronavirus origin||President Joe Biden rebuked China for stonewalling a U.S. investigation into the origins of the coronavirus, as his administration reported it was unable to reach firm conclusions because of Beijing’s unwillingness to cooperate. China denied that it had hindered the probe.“The world deserves answers, and I will not rest until we get them,” Biden said in a statement on Friday shortly after the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released an unclassified summary of the report. “Responsible nations do not shirk these kinds of responsibilities to the rest of the world.”The intelligence community determined the virus wasn’t created as a biological weapon and said Chinese officials had no “foreknowledge” of the outbreak, but was divided on how it came to infect humans and spread across the globe.Four components of the intelligence community said -- with low confidence -- that the outbreak was likely linked to exposure to an infected animal, according to the U.S. summary. This theory is the most widely supported by scientists, including Anthony Fauci, who is advising Biden on Covid.One intelligence community component assessed with moderate confidence that the outbreak was associated with a research lab in China. As of a few months ago, two components backed the animal theory while one backed the lab theory.The Chinese Embassy in the U.S expressed “strong condemnation” to the White House statement, and again called for investigation into the U.S. biological defense site Fort Detrick. The U.S. report doesn’t produce the answer the U.S. wants and “continuing such an effort will also be in vain, because its subject is simply non-existent and anti-science,” the Chinese statement said.“The report by the intelligence community is based on presumption of guilt on the part of China, and it is only for scapegoating China,” the statement said.No AgreementAnalysts at other U.S. agencies are unable to coalesce around either origin theory without more information, including some who think both are equally likely. To reach a conclusion with higher confidence, the intelligence community said it would need more cooperation of China, which it said continues to hinder global efforts. Beijing “continues to hinder the global investigation, resist sharing information and blame other countries, including the United States,” the summary says. “These actions reflect, in part, China’s government’s own uncertainty about where an investigation could lead as well as its frustration the international community is using the issue to exert political pressure on China.”The intelligence community overall believes that the virus infected humans through an initial small exposure no later than November of 2019, according to the report. The report says the intelligence agencies judge that the virus was not developed as a biological weapon, and most assess -- with low confidence -- that it was not genetically engineered, though two agencies believe there isn’t enough evidence to know either way. “China’s officials did not have foreknowledge of the virus before the initial outbreak of Covid-19 emerged,” the summary says. But the intelligence agencies and the global community lack clinical samples and other data from the earliest Covid-19 cases, the summary says. The report shows how far the government is from reaching a conclusion. Only five of the agencies, or components, of the intelligence community expressed any view and none did so with more than low or moderate confidence.The US Intelligence Community is made up of 18 different organizations, including the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which released the summary, and the Central Intelligence Agency, among others.The intelligence community sprinted to provide the report within Biden’s timeline, and approached it from multiple perspectives, including consulting scientists and epidemiologists, an official familiar with the process said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The intelligence community also reached out to academic experts, as well as international allies and partners, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-criticizes-china-for-not-aiding-report-on-coronavirus-origin-101630117806987.html
28-08-2021||World||More can be done for Afghans who have arrived in Britain, says govt||The British government acknowledged that more can be done to help and assist Afghan nationals and their families settle in Britain as they escape from Afghanistan following its takeover by the Taliban.Britain earlier announced plans to welcome up to 5,000 Afghans fleeing the Taliban during the first year of a new resettlement programme that will prioritise women, girls and religious and other minorities."Approximately only 5% of councils have declined to sign up to our relocation and assistance scheme and close to a third of councils have already stepped up to support new arrivals, but we know there is more that can be done for those that have risked their lives supporting us", a UK government spokesperson said in an emailed statement late on Friday."This is why we are calling on all councils who have not yet come forward with a firm offer of support to help Afghan nationals and their families as they build a new life here in safety", the spokesperson said.The Telegraph newspaper reported earlier that around 30 councils have refused to take any Afghan refugees who have arrived in the UK after fleeing the Taliban.An initial request from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government to local authorities was met with push back from around 10% of England's 333 councils, the newspaper had reported."We do not recognise these figures", the government spokesperson said in response to the report."Councils in England, Scotland and Wales will have access to a share of an additional £5 million to help them provide the necessary housing and support to Afghans who have worked for this country in Afghanistan, but who now face threats of persecution or worse," the statement added.The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in mid-August from a US-backed government, sending thousands fleeing and potentially heralding a return to the militants' austere and autocratic rule of two decades ago.Britain has so far evacuated more than more than 14,500 Afghan and British nationals, the defence ministry said late on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-can-be-done-for-afghans-who-have-arrived-in-britain-says-govt-101630116359572.html

According to the Pentagon, the drone strikes by the US military targeted a 'planner' of the IS outfit.The ISIS-K planner was suspected of being involved in plotting future attacks, but had no direct link to Thursday’s assault in Kabul, according to a US official speaking to the Bloomberg news agency on the condition of anonymity. He added that the target, traveling in a vehicle, was killed by a Reaper drone.Also Read | ‘Leave immediately’: US embassy warns Americans to avoid Kabul airportCaptain Bill Urban, a spokesperson for the US Central Command said the unmanned airstrike occurred in the Nangahar province of Afghanistan, adding that the initial indications hint that the target has been killed and there have been no civilian casualties.The airstrikes come in the wake of US president Joe Biden warning the Islamic State attackers of retaliation for the Kabul airport attack, saying the United States would neither forget nor forgive the act. “To those who carried out this attack as well as anyone who wishes America harm know this: We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay,” Biden had declared.Earlier in the day, the US embassy in Kabul issued a fresh advisory for Americans, asking them to avoid travelling to the Kabul airport because of security threats. Those at the Abbey, East, North, or the new ministry of interior gates should leave immediately, it said.

There were no reports of deer showing symptoms of infection, the USDA said."We do not know how the deer were exposed to SARS-CoV-2," USDA spokeswoman Lyndsay Cole wrote in an e-mail to Reuters. "It’s possible they were exposed through people, the environment, other deer, or another animal species."The USDA has previously reported Covid-19 in animals including dogs, cats, tigers, lions, snow leopards, otters, gorillas, and minks.Worldwide, most animal infections were reported in species that had close contact with a person with Covid-19, according to the agency.The USDA reported last month that white-tailed deer populations in Illinois, Michigan, New York, and Pennsylvania were exposed to SARS-CoV-2, based on a study that analyzed serum samples from free-ranging deer for antibodies to the disease.The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine collected samples from the infected deer in Ohio from January to March as part of ongoing studies, the USDA said. The samples were presumed to be positive for Covid-19 in university tests, and the cases were confirmed at USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories, according to the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/list-of-animals-affected-by-covid-19-expands-us-reports-first-case-in-a-deer-101630113113083.html
28-08-2021||World||Kabul attack killed 13 US troops, many of them in 20s. Here are their stories||A young husband with a child on the way. Another man who always wanted to be in the military. A man who planned to become a sheriff’s deputy when his deployment ended. Heartwrenching details began emerging Friday about some of the 13 US troops killed in a horrific suicide bombing at Afghanistan’s Kabul airport, which also claimed the lives of more than 160 Afghans.Eleven Marines, one Navy sailor, and one Army soldier were among the dead, while 18 other US service members were wounded in Thursday's bombing, which was blamed on Afghanistan’s offshoot of the Islamic State group. The US said it was the most lethal day for American forces in Afghanistan since 2011. The White House said President Joe Biden will look for opportunities to honor the servicemembers who lost their lives, many of whom were men in their early 20s.Here are details about some of the victims:RYLEE McCOLLUM, 20Rylee McCollum, a Marine and native of Bondurant, Wyoming, was married and his wife is expecting a baby in three weeks, his sister, Cheyenne McCollum, said.“He was so excited to be a dad, and he was going to be a great dad," McCollum said. She said her brother “was a Marine before he knew he was allowed to be a Marine ... He’d carry around his toy rifle and wear his sister’s pink princess snow boots and he’d either be hunting or he was a Marine. Sometimes it would be with nothing on underneath, just a T-shirt.”McCollum said her brother wanted to be a history teacher and a wrestling coach once he completed his service. Another sister, Roice McCollum, told the Casper Star-Tribune that her brother was on his first deployment when the evacuation in Afghanistan began.“We want to make sure that people know that these are the kids that are sacrificing themselves, and he’s got a family who loves him and a wife who loves him and a baby that he’ll never get to meet,” Cheyenne McCollum said.Regi Stone, the father of one of Rylee McCollum’s friends, described McCollum as “a good kid,” who was resilient, smart, and courageous. Stone shared a note that his wife, Kim, sent to their son Eli Stone, who is also in the military and deployed elsewhere. In the note, Kim wrote that she remembered telling the friends to run the other way if they had to go in first and that both of them said, “If we die doing this, we die doing what we love.”KAREEM MAE’LEE GRANT NIKOUI, 20Lance Corporal Kareem Mae’Lee Grant Nikoui, of Norco, California, sent videos to his family hours before he died, showing himself interacting with children in Afghanistan. In one of the clips, he asked a young boy to say hello.“Want to make a video together buddy?” Nikoui said, leaning in to take a video of himself with the boy. “All right, we’re heroes now, man.”Close family friend Paul Arreola said the videos show "the heart of this young man, the love he has.”“The family is just heartbroken," he said. Arreola described Nikoui as an “amazing young man” full of promise who always wanted to be a Marine and set out to achieve his goal. He is survived by his parents and three siblings.“He loved this country and everything we stand for. It’s just so hard to know that we’ve lost him,” he said, crying.Nikoui was also in the JROTC, and the Norco High School Air Force JROTC posted on Facebook that he was “one of our best Air Force JROTC cadets” and that “Kareem was set on being a Marine & always wanted to serve his country.”The city of Norco said Friday in a post on social media that Nikoui's name will be enshrined on a memorial wall in the city.JARED SCHMITZ, 20Marine Lance Corporal Jared Schmitz grew up in the St. Louis area and was among a group of Marines sent back to Afghanistan to assist with evacuation efforts, his father, Mark Schmitz, told KMOX Radio.Mark Schmitz said his son always wanted to be a Marine. He said he learned of his son's death when the Marines came to his home in Wentzville, Missouri, at 2:40 a.m. Friday.“This was something he always wanted to do, and I have never seen a young man train as hard as he did to be the best soldier he could be,” Schmitz said of his son. “His life meant so much more. I’m so incredibly devastated that I won’t be able to see the man that he was very quickly growing into becoming.”TAYLOR HOOVER, 31Staff Sgt. Taylor Hoover, of Utah, had been in the Marines for 11 years and was remembered as a hero who died serving others, his father Darin Hoover said.“He is a hero. He gave his life protecting those that can’t protect themselves, doing what he loved serving his country,” said Darin Hoover, who lives in a Salt Lake City suburb.He said he heard from Marines throughout the day Friday who said they are grateful they had his son as their sergeant.“They look back on him and say that they’ve learned so much from him,” Darin Hoover said. “One heck of a leader.”His father said his son was also a best friend to his two sisters and loved all his extended family. He had a girlfriend in California and was the kind of guy who “lit up a room” when he came in, his father said.Nate Thompson of Murray, Utah, first met Hoover when they were 10 years old in Little League football. They stayed friends through high school, where Hoover played lineman. He was undersized for the position, but his heart and hard work more than made up for what he lacked in stature, Thompson said. As a friend, he was selfless and kind.“If we had trouble with grades, trouble with family, or trouble on the field, we always called Taylor. He’s always level-headed, even if he’s struggling himself,” he said.DEAGAN WILLIAM-TYELER PAGE, 23Corporal Daegan William-Tyeler Page served in the 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment based at Camp Pendleton, California, and planned to go to a trade school and possibly become a lineman after his enlistment ended, his family said in a statement.Page was raised in Red Oak, Iowa, and in the Omaha metro area, and joined the Marines after graduating from Millard South High School. He is mourned by his girlfriend, parents, stepmom and stepdad, four siblings, and grandparents, the family said in a statement released by a family friend. The statement said the family did not wish to speak to the media at this time.“Daegan will always be remembered for his tough outer shell and giant heart,” the statement said. ”Our hearts are broken, but we are thankful for the friends and family who are surrounding us during this time. Our thoughts and prayers are also with the other Marine and Navy families whose loved ones died alongside Daegan.”RYAN KNAUSS, 23Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Knauss was remembered as a motivated man who loved his country and was looking forward to coming back to the US and eventually moving to Washington, D.C., family members told WATE-TV in Knoxville, Tennessee.Knauss’ grandfather, Wayne Knauss, told the television station that the family received word of Knauss's death on Friday, and funeral services were being planned. Knauss said his grandson attended Gibbs High School and grew up in a Christian home.“A motivated young man who loved his country,” Wayne Knauss said. “He was a believer, so we will see him again in God’s heaven.”Stepmother Linnae Knauss said Ryan planned to move to Washington after he returned to the US“He was a super-smart hilarious young man,” she said.HUNTER LOPEZ, 22Hunter Lopez, whose parents work at the Riverside County Sheriff's Department in Southern California, was a sheriff's Explorer for three years before joining the Marine Corps in September 2017, Sheriff Chad Bianco said.Bianco said Lopez planned to follow in his parents' footsteps and become a Riverside County Sheriff's Deputy after his deployment.DAVID LEE ESPINOZA, 20Lance Corporal David Lee Espinoza, a Marine from Laredo, Texas, joined the military after high school, and was being remembered as a hero by his mother.“He was just brave enough to go do what he wanted and to help out people. That’s who he was, he was just perfect," his mother, Elizabeth Holguin. told the Laredo Morning Times.Espinoza's death was confirmed earlier by US Rep. Henry Cuellar. The congressman's press secretary, Dana Youngentob, said Pentagon representatives visited Cuellar’s Washington office to inform him of Espinoza's death. Cuellar’s office also received an official death notice from the Pentagon.In a statement, Cuellar said Espinoza “embodied the values of America: grit, dedication, service, and valor. When he joined the military after high school, he did so with the intention of protecting our nation and demonstrating his selfless acts of service.”Cuellar concluded, “The brave never die. Mr. Espinoza is a hero.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabul-attack-killed-13-us-troops-many-of-them-in-20s-here-are-their-stories-101630111944807.html

"Details are continuing to be collected," The Hill reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-will-transfer-kabul-airport-back-to-afghan-people-state-department-101630111335896.html

Among four parents infected, three were fully vaccinated.Twenty-two of the 27 total infected people (81 percent) reported symptoms, the most frequently reported were fever, followed by cough, headache and sore throat.No one involved in the outbreak was hospitalized.The CDC said the outbreak was likely underestimated because all testing was voluntary."The outbreak's attack rate highlights the Delta variant's increased transmissibility and potential for rapid spread, especially in unvaccinated populations such as schoolchildren too young for vaccination," said the report's authors.- What works -In addition to vaccinating school staff, they stressed the need for multi-pronged mitigation strategies, including using masks, distancing and ventilation, and staying home when sick.A second CDC study also released Friday was held up by the agency's director Rochelle Walensky as an example of what happens when best practices are followed.It showed that during the winter pandemic peak, case rates among children and adolescents in Los Angeles County schools were nearly 3.5 times lower than rates in the surrounding community."We know what works. Now let us unify together to follow these steps to ensure fundamentally that our children and our future are safe," said Walensky at a press briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unvaccinated-us-school-teacher-spread-covid-19-to-26-people-101630110984020.html
28-08-2021||World||Delta variant of Covid-19 doubles hospital risk in comparison to Alpha: Study||The Delta variant of the virus that causes Covid-19 doubles the risk of hospitalisation compared to the Alpha variant it has supplanted as the dominant strain worldwide, researchers reported Saturday in The Lancet.Only 1.8 percent of the more than 43,000 Covid cases assessed in comparing the two variants were in patients who had been fully vaccinated.Three-quarters were completely unvaccinated, and 24 percent had only received one jab of a two-dose vaccine."The results from this study therefore primarily tell us about the risk of hospital admission for those who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated," said co-lead author Anne Presanis, a Senior Statistician at the University of Cambridge's MRC Biostatistics Unit.Researchers analysed healthcare data from 43,338 COVID-19 cases in England from March 29 to May 23 of this year, including vaccination status, emergency care, hospital admission and other patient information.All virus samples underwent whole genome sequencing, the surest way to confirm which variant had caused the infection.Just under 80 percent of the cases were identified as the Alpha variant, and the rest were Delta.Around one in 50 patients were admitted to hospital within 14 days of their first positive Covid-19 test.After accounting for factors that are known to affect susceptibility to severe illness -- including age, ethnicity, and vaccination status -- the researchers found the risk of being admitted to hospital was more than doubled with the Delta variant.- 'Excellent protection' -Since these samples were taken, Delta has surged and now accounts for over 98 percent of new Covid-19 cases in Britain, the authors said.Multiple studies have shown that full vaccination prevents infection with symptoms and hospitalisation, for both Alpha and Delta variants."We already know that vaccination offers excellent protection against Delta," said Gavin Dabrera, another lead author and a consultant epidemiologist at the National Infection Service, Public Health England."It is vital that those who have not received two doses of vaccine do so as soon as possible."An earlier study from Scotland also reported a doubling in hospitalisation risk with Delta over Alpha, suggesting that Delta causes more severe disease.The Delta variant was first reported in India in December 2020 and early studies found it to be up to 50 percent more transmissible than the Alpha variant, which was first identified in England in September last year.Nearly 4.5 million deaths worldwide have been attributed to Covid-19, though the final tally is likely to be higher once "excess deaths" are calculated over the pandemic period.In some countries -- and some states in the United States -- hospitalisation and death rates are the highest they have been since the first cases reported at the beginning of 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-of-covid-19-doubles-hospital-risk-in-comparison-to-alpha-study-101630110059899.html
28-08-2021||World||More Kabul attacks likely, US on alert as it attempts more evacuations ahead of deadline||The US said it believes there are still "specific, credible" threats against the Kabul airport after Thursday’s suicide bombing by the Islamic State at one of its gates killed nearly 80 Afghans and 13 US soldiers. "We certainly are prepared and would expect future attempts. We're monitoring these threats, very, very specifically, virtually in real-time,” Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby told reporters.According to the White House, the next few days of an ongoing US evacuation operation are likely to be the most dangerous. US, which has taken about 111,000 people out of Afghanistan in the past two weeks, and allied forces are racing to complete evacuations of their citizens and vulnerable Afghans and to withdraw from Afghanistan by an August 31 deadline set by President Joe Biden.The White House said about 4,200 people were evacuated from Kabul during a 12-hour period on Friday and US officials said a total of approximately 5,100 Americans had been airlifted, with about 500 more waiting to leave. Tens of thousands of Afghans are still waiting to be evacuated and a crowd of people could still be seen outside the airport to try to get onto evacuation flights.Also read | The ideology and evolution of Islamic State-KhorasanSome US media, including the New York Times, cited local health officials as saying up to 170 people, not including the US soldiers, were killed in Thursday's attack—the deadliest incident for American troops in Afghanistan in a decade.Two senior Taliban officials said their forces have taken up positions in Kabul airport and are ready to take full control as early as this weekend, as soon as U.S. forces leave. According to Reuters, one senior commander said Taliban forces had taken over most of the airport, "just not a small part where the Americans still are". "As soon as the Americans leave, they just have to give us the signal and we will then take over," a second Taliban official said.Also read | Plan to mount evacuation ops in Afghanistan: MEAHowever, Kirby told reporters that the military section of the airport remains under US control. "They are not in charge of any of the gates. They are not in charge of any of the airport operations. That is still under US military control," Kirby said.White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the US expects some engagement with the Taliban will be necessary after the withdrawal to facilitate further evacuations. "The reality is, the Taliban control large swathes of Afghanistan, including the areas surrounding the perimeter of the airport. So by necessity, that is our option,” Psaki said.Islamic State Khorasan Province has claimed responsibility for the attack, which the US said on Friday was carried out by one suicide bomber at an airport gate, not two as earlier stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-kabul-attacks-likely-us-on-alert-as-it-attempts-more-evacuations-ahead-of-deadline-101630109675619.html

28-08-2021||World||Kabul airport suicide attack: US vows revenge||The US pressed on with a monumental evacuation process from Afghanistan on Friday amid fears of more bloodshed a day after the suicide attack at Kabul airport killed well over 100 Afghans and 13 US service members, and President Joe Biden vowed to hunt down those responsible for the terror strike.In an emotional speech, Biden said the evacuations will be completed, and declared to the extremists responsible for the bombings: “We will not forgive, we will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay.”He said the Islamic State (IS) group’s Afghanistan affiliate was to blame for the Thursday attacks and that there was no evidence that they colluded with the Taliban, who now control the country. The group, IS-Khorasan (IS-K) – an enemy of both the US and the Taliban – too claimed responsibility for the attack. It said in a statement that one of its suicide bombers had targeted “translators and collaborators with the American army” near the Kabul airport.Two officials said on the condition of anonymity that the Afghan death toll in Thursday’s bombing was higher than first anticipated – at least 169 -- while the US said it was the deadliest day for American forces in Afghanistan since August 2011. The 13 US service members who died included 10 Marines, a Navy sailor and an Army soldier. The military has not identified them or given a service affiliation for the last victim.The attack underlined the realpolitik facing Western powers in Afghanistan: engaging with the Taliban, who they have long sought to fend off, may be their only chance to prevent the country sliding into a breeding ground for extremist militancy.At the White House on Thursday, Biden – already facing strong criticism at home and abroad over the chaos surrounding troop withdrawal that led to the Taliban’s lightning advance to Kabul -- asked for a moment of silence to honour the service members. He bowed his head, and ordered US flags to half-staff across the country.Asked by a reporter if he bore any responsibility for the deaths, he said: “I bear responsibility fundamentally for all that’s happened of late.”As for the bombers and gunmen involved, he said, “We have some reason to believe we know who they are.” He said he had instructed military commanders to develop plans to strike IS “assets, leadership and facilities”.The US warned that more attacks could come ahead of President Biden’s fast-approaching deadline to withdraw American forces from Afghanistan by Tuesday. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said: “We certainly are prepared and expect future attempts” at terror attacks as the evacuation winds down.The Pentagon also said that there was one suicide bomber instead of two previously thought.As the call to prayer echoed on Friday through Kabul along with the roar of departing planes, the anxious crowds thronging the airport in hope of escaping Taliban rule appeared as large as ever despite the bombing. Afghans, American citizens and other foreigners were all acutely aware the window is closing to board a flight before the airlift ends and Western troops withdraw.The attacks led a witness, Jamshad, to head there in the morning with his wife and three small children, clutching an invitation to a Western country he didn’t want to name. “After the explosion I decided I would try because I am afraid now there will be more attacks, and I think now I have to leave,” said Jamshad, who like many Afghans uses only one name.The names of the Afghan victims began emerging and included a news agency founder along with a number of impoverished Afghans who had gone to the airport in hopes of realising a better life.By the morning after the attack, the Taliban posted a pickup full of fighters and three captured Humvees and set up a barrier 500 metres from the airport, holding the crowds farther back from the US troops at the airport gates.General Frank McKenzie, head of US Central Command, said in the hours after the bombings that the US would adjust security outside the gates as needed, including possibly asking the Taliban to change the location of their checkpoints.McKenzie said American forces have to stand close to would-be evacuees to make sure they are not carrying any weapons that could cause even greater loss of life aboard a plane.“Somebody has actually got to watch someone else in the eyes and decide that they’re ready to come in” the airport gates, McKenzie said.The Taliban have wrested back control of Afghanistan two decades after they were ousted in a US-led invasion following the 9/11 attacks. Their return to power has terrified many Afghans, who fear they will reimpose the kind of repressive rule they did when they were last in control. Thousands have rushed to flee the country ahead of the American withdrawal as a result.The US said more than 100,000 people have been safely evacuated from Kabul, but thousands more are struggling to leave in one of history’s largest airlifts.Outside the airport, Afghans acknowledged that going to the airport was risky — but said they had few choices. “Believe me, I think that an explosion will happen any second or minute, God is my witness, but we have lots of challenges in our lives, that is why we take the risk to come here and we overcome fear,” said Ahmadullah Herawi.Many others will try to escape over land borders. The UN refugee agency said a half-million people or more could flee in a worst-case scenario in the coming months.But chances to help those hoping to join the evacuation are fading fast. More European allies and other nations were ending their airlifts Friday, in part to give the US time to wrap up its own operations and get 5,000 of its troops out by Tuesday.The Indian ministry of external affairs said on Friday that India’s priority will be to evacuate Indian citizens from the country and the Afghan nationals “who stood by us”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabul-airport-suicide-attack-us-vows-revenge-101630104060085.html
28-08-2021||World||Critical information about Covid-19 origin 'exists in China': US President Biden||The US intelligence community does not believe it can resolve a debate over whether a Chinese laboratory incident was the source of Covid-19 without more information, US officials said in a declassified summary on Friday.US officials said only China can help solve questions about the true origins of the virus that has now killed 4.6 million people worldwide. "China's cooperation most likely would be needed to reach a conclusive assessment of the origins of Covid-19," they said.President Joe Biden, who received a classified report earlier this week summarizing the investigation he had ordered, said Washington and its allies will continue to press the Chinese government for answers."Critical information about the origins of this pandemic exists in the People's Republic of China, yet from the beginning, government officials in China have worked to prevent international investigators and members of the global public health community from accessing it," Biden said in a statement after the summary was released.The summary, released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, was set to worsen discord between Beijing and Washington at a time when the countries' ties are at their lowest point in decades. In the United States, activists worried the investigation could also encourage violence against Asian Americans.Reuters earlier reported that administration officials did not expect the analysis to settle debate about the virus' origin.China has ridiculed a theory that Covid-19 escaped from the state virology lab in Wuhan and pushed fringe theories including that the virus slipped out of a lab in Fort Detrick, Maryland, in 2019.The US report revealed new detail about the extent of the disagreement within the Biden administration over the so-called lab leak theory.Several organizations within the sprawling US intelligence community thought the novel coronavirus emerged from "natural exposure to an animal infected with it or a close progenitor virus," according to the summary.But they had only "low confidence" in that conclusion, the summary said. Other groups were not able to come to any firm opinion at all on the origins.One intelligence community segment, however, developed "moderate confidence" that the first human infection with Covid was likely due to a "laboratory-associated incident, probably involving experimentation, animal handling, or sampling by the Wuhan Institute of Virology" in China.A team led by the World Health Organization (WHO) that spent four weeks in and around Wuhan in January and February dismissed that theory. But their March report https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/origins-of-the-virus, which was written jointly with Chinese scientists, has been faulted for using insufficient evidence to dismiss the theory.The new US report concluded that analysts would not be able to provide "a more definitive explanation" without new information from China, such as clinical samples and epidemiological data about the earliest cases.Initially, US spy agencies strongly favored the explanation that the virus originated in nature. But people familiar with intelligence reporting have said there has been little corroboration over recent months that the virus had spread widely and naturally among wild animals."While this review has concluded, our efforts to understand the origins of this pandemic will not rest," Biden said. "We will do everything we can to trace the roots of this outbreak that has caused so much pain and death around the world, so that we can take every necessary precaution to prevent it from happening again."The World Health Organization's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said the group has not ruled out any hypothesis. The Geneva-based organization is set to impanel a new committee to develop next steps on studying the virus SARS-CoV-2.But epidemiological experts said the window was closing for any useful data to be collected, particularly from people infected by the disease in 2019, when the virus likely first emerged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/critical-information-about-covid-19-origin-exists-in-china-us-president-biden-101630100580198.html

This authorized the US Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate disaster relief efforts in the state."Unfortunately, Louisiana is forecast to get a direct, strong hit from Tropical Storm #Ida, which is compounded by our current fourth surge of Covid-19. This is an incredibly challenging time for our state," Edwards wrote on Twitter.US energy companies racing to complete evacuations of offshore platforms in the Gulf ahead of the storm had reduced petroleum production by nearly 60% and gas output by almost half, federal regulators said.CARIBBEAN TAKES FIRST HITSoon after being upgraded to hurricane status, Ida smashed into Cuba's Isle of Youth, off the southwestern end of the Caribbean island nation, meteorologists said.They said the storm was expected to keep gaining strength and speed as it churned over northwestern Caribbean into the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, endangering the coastlines of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.If forecasts proved accurate, Ida would end up making US landfall 16 years after the region was devastated by Hurricane Katrina.Officials in US coastal areas preparing for the storm urged residents to move boats out of harbors and encouraged early evacuations.Officials in Louisiana's Lafourche Parish said they would enact a voluntary evacuation, especially for people in low-lying areas, mobile homes and RVs."By Saturday evening, everyone should be in the location where they intend to ride out the storm," Edwards said on Thursday.Cuba's meteorology institute said Ida would cause storm surges as far east as Havana. The governor of the Isle of Youth Adian Morera said an evacuation center was ready to receive families in the main town of Nueva Gerona, and sea vessels had already been secured along the coast.Jamaica was flooded by heavy rains, and there were landslides after the passage of the storm. Many roads were impassable, forcing some residents to abandon their homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-gulf-coast-braces-for-hit-after-hurricane-ida-hits-cuba-s-isle-of-youth-101630100506286.html

Biden reaffirmed to the commanders “his approval of all authorities they need to conduct the operations and protect our troops”.US forces helping to evacuate people desperate to flee Taliban rule were already on alert for more attacks throughout Friday after an IS-K strike killed around 100 people outside Kabul airport.Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the US believed there are “specific, credible” threats against the airport. “We certainly are prepared and would expect future attempts,” Kirby told reporters in Washington.US and allied forces are racing to complete evacuations of their citizens and vulnerable Afghans and to withdraw from Afghanistan by an August 31 deadline set by President Joe Biden.On Friday, some sections of the US media cited local health officials as saying 170 people died in the attack. The attack also marked the first US military casualties in Afghanistan since February 2020 and represented the deadliest incident for US troops there in a decade.Medical staff in the operating theatres of Kabul’s Emergency Hospital worked through the night treating casualties. “Everybody is concerned at this moment in Kabul, nobody knows what to expect in the coming hours,” said Rossella Miccio, president of the Italian aid group that runs the hospital.Frank McKenzie, head of US Central Command, said the US will press on with evacuations.Afghans can travel freely in future, say TalibanAfghans with valid documents will be able to travel freely in the future at any time, a Taliban official said in a televised address aimed at calming fears. “The Afghan borders will be open and people will be able to travel at any time into and out of Afghanistan,” said Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, deputy head of the movement’s political commission.Anger over list shared by US officials: ReportAccording to a controversial report done by Politico, US officials in Afghanistan naively gave the Taliban a list of Afghans who had aided US forces in the country, sparking fears that the new regime could use that information to persecute them. The report says US officials gave the Taliban names of US citizens, green card holders and Afghan allies so they could be allowed to enter the airport in Kabul.A similar development involving British officials has been reported. The UK’s defence chief promised to “get to the bottom of” a security lapse that saw documents identifying Afghan staff left behind at the abandoned British embassy in Kabul.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-told-another-terrorist-attack-likely-in-kabul-white-house-101630086450390.html
