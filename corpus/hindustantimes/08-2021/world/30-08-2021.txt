They did not say whether this included top envoy Ross Wilson, expected to be among the last to leave before the final troops themselves.A US official said initial reports did not indicate any American casualties from as many as five missiles fired on the airport. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the rocket attacks. The rockets followed a massive suicide bombing outside the teeming airport gates on Thursday, which killed scores of Afghans and 13 US troops.Of the five rockets fired at the airport on Monday, three missed the target, one was shot down by US defence systems, and a fifth landed on the airport compound causing little damage and no injuries.Also Read | Islamic State group claims latest Kabul attack: ReportThe US also said it was investigating widespread reports that a number of civilians, possibly nine members of the same family including several children, were killed as it carried out a drone strike on Sunday to target a suicide bomber planning to strike the airport.“We are aware, reports of civilian casualties and we take these reports very seriously, and we are continuing to assess the situation,” Major General Hank Taylor said at the Pentagon’s briefing amid criticism over the civilian casualties.The threat of more attacks against Kabul airport remained acute, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said.Kirby said the evacuation operation at the airport, currently controlled by thousands of US troops, is on high alert after the Islamic State-Khorasan launched five rockets.“We’re in a particularly dangerous time right now,” Kirby told reporters. “The threat stream is still real, it’s still active, and in many cases it’s still specific.”US troops, whose numbers grew to 5,800 after the evacuation operation began on August 14, were already departing ahead of the August 31 deadline set by President Joe Biden to fully exit the country, now in the hands of the Taliban that US forces fought for two decades.Taylor said more than 122,000 people have been evacuated from Kabul since July, including 5,400 Americans. He said it will continue to be possible to evacuate US citizens still in Afghanistan to the last moment.“The mission of the evacuation operation was to help as many people as possible leave Afghanistan,” he said.Tuesday’s deadline for all troops to leave was ordered by Biden, fulfilling an agreement reached with the Taliban by his predecessor Donald Trump to end Washington’s longest war.The Taliban will take full control of Kabul airport after the American withdrawal on Tuesday, Qatar’s Al Jazeera television network cited an unidentified Taliban member as saying.“This is the most dangerous time in an already extraordinarily dangerous mission these last couple of days,” said America’s top diplomat, secretary of state Antony Blinken.The White House said that about 1,200 people were evacuated from Kabul over the prior 24 hours aboard 26 US military flights and two allied flights.In a statement, the US Central Command said it was looking into the reports of civilian casualties that may have been caused by secondary explosions in the drone strike. An Afghan official said three children were killed in the strike.It was the second airstrike in recent days the US has conducted against the militant group. The Pentagon said a US drone mission in eastern Afghanistan killed two members of IS’ Afghanistan affiliate early Saturday local time in retaliation for the airport bombing.The White House has rescheduled Biden’s meeting with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, from Monday to Wednesday as the US pullout from Afghanistan enters its tense final hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rockets-fired-at-american-forces-on-eve-of-af-exit-101630346277814.html

Check list here||The countries constituting the European Union (EU) voted to remove the United States from the Covid-19 safe travel list, and reimpose fresh restrictions on non-essential travel, amid the country witnessing an upward swing in the infection rates, news agencies reported on Monday.According to a statement, a majority of ambassadors voted to reintroduce the curbs that were lifted in June this year. Apart from the US, five other nations that include Israel, Kosovo, Lebanon, Montenegro, and North Macedonia were also removed from the EU’s safe-travel list.The statement issued by the EU, however, stated that the guidance is a recommendation by the bloc and any decision on who to enter the countries that are part of the union, and what curbs to impose, ultimately remains for the respective governments to make. Furthermore, countries can also choose to accept proof of Covid-19 vaccination to waive travel curbs, the statement noted.Also Read | Fueled by Delta, Covid cases are on the rise in US; Florida hit worstThe decision comes even as airlines and travel firms have been insisting for a complete reopening of transatlantic routes. Also, shares of Air France-KLM, IAG SA and Deutsche Lufthansa AG came under pressure after the news of the bloc vote emerged.According to the New York Times, the single-day average hospitalised Covid-19 patients in the US is more than 100,000 over the last week. The growing number of patients is straining hospitals and healthcare workers even as deaths have seen a hike of over 1,000 per day on average – for the first time since March this year.Moreover, hospitalisations across the country have increased by nearly 500 per cent in the previous two months, with Florida currently having as many as 16,457 hospitalisations, followed by Texas, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services, the New York Times report added.Since the emergence of the virus, the US has confirmed 38,524,389 Covid-19 cases and 631, 134 fatalities so far, as per the global bulletin maintained by the World Health Organisation (WHO).(With inputs from Bloomberg)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-removes-us-and-5-other-nations-from-covid-safe-travel-list-check-list-here-101630344139941.html
30-08-2021||World||US knew of Pak N-plan but did not act: Declassified documents||The US state department knew Pakistan’s uranium enrichment programme using gas centrifuge technology way back in January 1979, along with a nascent enrichment facility in Kahuta, according to newly declassified and available American government documents.The documents posted on Tuesday by the National Security Archive, a non-government organisation that seeks to challenge government secrecy, published state department telegrams and internal memorandums from the time. Though alarmed by the discovery of Pakistan’s emerging nuclear capabilities, the Jimmy Carter administration refused to confront Islamabad for fear of alienating it at a time of challenging developments in the region - the Iranian revolution and growing Soviet Union influence in Afghanistan.The Carter administration also did not want to push Pakistan too hard because it saw it as a counterweight to Soviet-partner India, the documents show. “Pakistan is moving rapidly and secretly towards the construction of facilities which will give it nuclear explosive capability perhaps within two to four years,” wrote Harold Saunders, the then assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern and South Asian affairs, and Thomas Pickering, then assistant secretary for oceans, international environmental, and scientific affairs, to then secretary of state Cyrus Vance in January 1979.Pakistan would test its nuclear weapons, thus made its programme public, almost 20 years later in 1998, in response to Pokhran II tests by India, which, incidentally, had first revealed its nuclear capabilities in 1974 with Operation Smiling Buddha.Saunders and Pickering had gone on to lay down policy options for the United State to response, among them was aid-cut, which was not recommended as it could “complicate” matter, and direct contact with the Pakistanis, including an invitation to President Zia ul-Haq when the “dust has settled on the Bhutto case”. Former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who had been overthrown by Zia in 1977, was on death row then, and hanged in April 1979.President Carter, who came to office as a strong opponent of proliferation, faced an “acute dilemma” over Pakistan because, the National Security Archive said citing another January 1979 State telegram, “we (the US under Carter) wish to be more supportive” of Islamabad in the wake of a revolution in Iran and growing Soviet influence in Afghanistan.The then administration also “worried that pushing too hard on proliferation concerns could alienate Pakistan - a regional counterweight to Soviet partner India - and produce greater instability in the region”.“Ultimately, the archive added, “Carter held back from confronting Islamabad over its nuclear programme.”The Saunders-Pickering memo had been based on two findings, the National Security Archive said: One, Pakistan was found ‘building a facility capable of small-scale reprocessing, near the PINSTECH (Pakistan Institute for Science and Technology) research centre that would be capable of producing enough plutonium for at least one nuclear device annually. This was a reference to the ‘New Labs’ project, among other activities.The second was that a “secret gas centrifuge programme is intended to yield significant quantities of HEU (highly enriched uranium)”. The Pakistanis had already “succeeded in operating small number of centrifuge units”.Moreover, the archive said, referring to Kahuta, but not naming it, the Pakistanis “have plans for 7,000 units, and have begun to construct buildings to house the facility and to acquire equipment for the plant.” It would take about 2 years of work for the plant to operate and another two years before it could produce HEU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-knew-of-pak-n-plan-but-did-not-act-declassified-documents-101630344585153.html

He said the crisis once again underscored the fragility of ceasefire and urgent need for addressing the underlying causes that had triggered the escalation.Addressing the meeting in his national capacity, Shringla called on all parties to the conflict to refrain from acts that could exacerbate tensions and worsen the security situation in the region.“We recognise the efforts made by the UN and regional countries to prevent the hostilities from escalating into another military conflict,” Shringla said at the meeting, titled ‘Middle East Peace Process, including the Palestine Question’.Also read | 'T word is gone': UNSC does not mention Taliban in its terror statement“I reaffirm India’s call for regular and predictable transfer of aid and other essential items to Gaza to ease the humanitarian situation and facilitate early reconstruction, as well as for appropriate use of such aid,” the foreign secretary said.Shringla also stressed on "high-level interaction" between Israel and Palestine that contributed to a better environment for the resumption of direct peace negotiations."We hope to see early commencement of these negotiations between the two sides, as they provide the best opportunity to resolve all final status issues and achieve a two-state solution. The international community, the Middle East Quartet in particular, has an important role to play in reviving these negotiations," he said.Also read | Can’t be complacent about terror groups in Afghanistan, says India at UNSC meet“It is also important that the international donor community supports the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip through the Palestinian authority,” he said."The West Bank continues to witness incidents of violence and clashes between the Palestinians and Israeli security forces. Both sides must desist from provocative actions in the interest of peace and stability,” Shringla said."We note the progress in the legal challenge to the eviction of Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah and underscore the need for respecting the historic status quo in East Jerusalem and its neighbourhoods. We also urge parties to refrain from unilateral actions that undermine the viability of the two-State solution," he added.He underlined that "given our long-standing and firm commitment to the establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine, within secure, recognised and mutually agreed borders, living side by side with Israel in peace and security, India will remain fully supportive of all efforts to restart the peace process."His remarks comes a day after Israel's Defence Minister Benny Gantz held talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank on Sunday, the first high-level meeting between the two sides in years.In his speech, Shringla noted that the decision by Israel to increase the number of work permits issued to Palestinians will help strengthen both the Palestinian and Israeli economies."Further, the recognition of COVID-vaccination certificates issued by the Palestinian Authority and the facilitation of passage of patients from the Gaza Strip to the West Bank are also positive signals," he said.Speaking about India’s contribution, Shringla said the country had helped in building schools, setting up ICT and vocational training centres, a technology park and a national printing press; and is also supporting several other quick-impact community projects in Palestine.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-unsc-meet-shringla-talks-of-ceasefire-fragility-escalation-in-gaza-strip-101630342480929.html
30-08-2021||World||Trump admin lost H-1B visa fight in its dying days||The Trump administration lost its fight against H-1B visas - used by US companies to hire foreign workers for high skilled jobs, most of them from India - in its dying days.It was beaten by US courts.In the last two quarters of financial year 2021 - from October 2020 to March 2021, most of which was Trump administration - the denial rates of new H-1B visas went down to 7.1% from 28% over a comparable period in 2020, says new research from the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP), a non-partisan think-tank, based on data published by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).New or “initial” H-1Bs are fresh employment cases that count against the congressionally-mandated annual cap of 85,000, and not renewal of existing employment (H-1B is granted first for three years and then for a maximum of another three years).“The credit goes to the business associations, companies, universities and attorneys who fought the Trump administration’s H-1B policies, as well as the judges who were willing to listen to the arguments for why the policies were unlawful,” said Stuart Anderson, NFAP executive director.The denial rates of FY 2020 were not an exception but a trend emerged under President Donald Trump, who despite being a user of H-1B visa as a businessman, sided with immigration hawks of his administration to crack down on the work programme.The denial rate was 24% in FY 2018, 21% in FY 2019 and 13% in FY 2020, compared to 6% in FY 2015 and the report suggested that the FY 2020 denial rate would have been much higher but for the court rulings that kept the denial rate low in the fourth quarter.“The Trump administration managed to carry out what judges determined to be unlawful policies for nearly four years, illustrating the limitations of relying on the court system to prevent restrictive immigration policies,” the report said.The denial rate for “continuing” H-1B petitions - essentially renewal for existing employees - was 3% in the first two quarters of FY 2021, compared to 7% in FY 2020 and as high as 12% in FY 2018 and FY 2019. NFAP research showed the USCIS turned down only 3% of H-1B petitions for continuing employment in FY 2015, 5% in FY 2017.The trump administration sought to make its H-1B policies that had been tried through executive orders lawful through an “interim final rule” in October 2020. The rule was, however, struck down by a court for violating the Administrative Procedure Act, the NFAP report said, adding that companies and universities said the regulation would have made it nearly impossible to employ H-1B visa holders.H-1B policy changes brought by the Trump administration have been costly for employers. An NFAP analysis estimates that a policy change announced by the USCIS in 2015 may have cost employers approximately $600 million a year, or more than $3 billion, in legal costs since 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-admin-lost-h-1b-visa-fight-in-dying-days-101630342785973.html

The new rule states that minors in China will be allowed to play games on their phone for only three hours a week starting September 1.The National Press and Public Administration said that children can play games between 8pm and 9pm on Fridays and weekends and on public holidays. The new rule decreases the gaming time for children to three hours on maximum weeks of the year. Earlier, the Chinese government allowed minors to spend 90 minutes per day and three hours per week on mobile gaming.The Chinese government also said that it would increase the frequency of inspections of online game companies to make sure that these technology sector giants adhere to the regulations.China’s tech companies affected by new ruleGaming giant Tencent as well as NetEase were affected by the new regulations. Tencent, known for its Honor of Kings online multiplayer game globally, saw its stock price close down 0.6% at 465.80 Hong Kong dollars on Monday ahead of the regulator’s announcement.Tencent’s market capitalization of $573 billion is down more than $300 billion from its February peak, according to a report by news agency Associated Press. The decline is equal to more than the total value of Nike Inc and Pfizer Inc.The Chinese government is imposing these restrictions on gaming in a bid to control technology companies who they believe ‘may have an outsized influence on society’. Tencent earlier said it would limit gaming time for children to 60 minutes to an hour per day and to two hours during holidays. The company also banned children under the age of 12 from making in-game purchases.(with inputs from Associated Press)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-limits-mobile-gaming-time-to-three-hours-for-minors-report-101630341733078.html
30-08-2021||World||Pakistan NSA walks back remarks on Taliban, 9/11 attacks||Days after Pakistan’s National Security Adviser Moeed Yousuf was cited by the British media as a warning that a failure to engage with the Taliban would lead to the same mistakes that resulted in the 9/11 attacks, his office has described the connotation as fabricated. “Mark my words...If the mistakes of the nineties are made again and Afghanistan is abandoned, the outcome will be absolutely the same – a security vacuum filled by undesirable elements who will threaten everyone, Pakistan and the West,” Yusuf was quoted as saying by The Times on Saturday. The report, titled “Work with the Taliban or repeat the horror of the 1990s, West told”, came against the backdrop of support from sections of Pakistan’s political leadership for the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. Pakistan is among the very few countries that have kept their missions in Kabul open and are spearheading efforts to build consensus among regional countries for a Taliban-led set-up. “We told the West again and again this was an unwinnable war... If they had listened to Pakistan they would not be in this situation,” Yusuf was quoted as saying by The Times. The report said Yusuf is at the “forefront of a PR offensive by Imran Khan’s government to get the world to engage with the Taliban and start working with them”. The report added that Pakistan was warning other countries that the failure to work with the Taliban will result in them facing a “massive humanitarian crisis” and also “drive the new Taliban regime into more extreme behaviour and allow in foreign terrorists”. Yusuf said engagement with the Taliban is “the only way”, adding this should be “engagement today, not two weeks or three weeks from now”. This will “ensure the Taliban remain moderate and the incentive for that is legitimacy and assistance which only the West can provide,” he said. He defended the Taliban by saying there were “good” signals such as general amnesty announced by the group. He said the “political reality” was that the Taliban were in “control of 95% of the country” and also rejected criticism that Pakistani backing had helped the militant group. A statement issued by Yusuf’s office said the connotation in the report was “fabricated and totally wrongly attributed” to the NSA. It said the report in The Times was a “gross mischaracterisation” of Yusuf’s conversation with the newspaper’s reporter. “At no point did [Yusuf] state that the West should ‘immediately recognise’ the Taliban, as the article states. Nor was there any ‘warning’ of a second 9/11 linked to formal ‘recognition’ of the Taliban. This is a highly inflammatory mischaracterisation of his remarks, one that smacks of unprofessional journalism,” the statement said. “To reiterate, absolutely no threat was either intended or made, nor does the NSA subscribe to such inflammatory rhetoric. The NSA clearly stated that the world had acknowledged that abandoning Afghanistan and Pakistan in the 1990s was a mistake and presented his view that lessons from the past must be learned,” it added. The statement said demand for the report to be retracted had been sent to the newspaper by the Pakistan high commission in London.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-nsa-walks-back-remarks-on-taliban-9-11-attacks-101630342005789.html

In a weekend interview to AFP, he pointed out that the group will crack down on such attacks after foreign forces leave the war-torn nation.“We hope that those Afghans who are influenced by [the] IS… will give up their operations on seeing the formation of an Islamic government in the absence of foreigners,” Mujahid was quoted as saying.He further said that if these Afghans along with the IS “create a situation for war” and continue carrying out their operations, the “Islamic government (as the Taliban prefers to call themselves) … we will deal with them.”This comes after the Islamic State-Khorasan group claimed responsibility for a rocket attack at Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport on Monday. “The soldiers of the caliphate targeted Kabul’s international airport with six… rockets,” reported AFP quoting a statement from the group.The attack comes in the backdrop of a deadly explosion by the same group last week that led to over 100 fatalities, including 13 US soldiers. The deadline for US-led forces to pull out from Afghanistan is till Tuesday, which will end the nation’s longest war in its history.Meanwhile, addressing the drone strikes carried out by the US, targeting a member of the ISIS-K in easter Afghanistan, Mujahid told AFP that there is “no permission for them [the US] to do such operations.” “Our independence must be respected,” he added.Also Read | US hits back at ISIS-K days after Kabul attack, 'kills' terrorist planner in drone strike in AfghanistanThis isn’t the first time that the Taliban blamed the presence of foreign forces for such terrorist attacks by the IS.

30-08-2021||World||Russia warns of increase in cases of West Nile Virus: All you need to know||Russia warned on Monday of a possible increase in West Nile Virus (WNV) infections this autumn as mild temperatures and heavy precipitation create favourable conditions for the mosquitos that carry it."In light of favourable climatic conditions this year - an abundance of precipitation... a warm and long autumn, a high number of (virus) carriers could be observed in the autumn," Rospotrebnadzor, Russia's consumer health watchdog, said.More than 80% of Russia's West Nile fever cases are recorded in its southwest region.What is West Nile Virus?WNV is an infectious disease spread by infected mosquitoes. It spreads from birds to humans with the bite of an infected Culex mosquito. It can lead to a fatal neurological disease in humans.The virus causes West Nile fever in around 20 per cent of cases, according to World Health Organization (WHO). It is related to the Zika, dengue and yellow fever viruses.What are the symptoms of WNV?People who get WNV usually have no symptoms or mild symptoms. The symptoms include a fever, headache, body aches, skin rash, and swollen lymph glands. They can last a few days to several weeks, and usually go away on their own.Where did the WNV originate?According to WHO, WNV was first isolated in a woman in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937. It was identified in birds (crows and columbiformes) in Nile delta region in 1953.Before 1997, WNV was not considered pathogenic for birds, but at that time in Israel a more virulent strain caused the death of different bird species presenting signs of encephalitis and paralysis. Human infections attributable to WNV have been reported in many countries for over 50 years, the WHO said.When is it dangerous?If West Nile virus enters the brain, it can be life-threatening. It may cause inflammation of the brain, called encephalitis, or inflammation of the tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, called meningitis.How is WNV diagnosed?A physical exam, medical history, and laboratory tests can diagnose it.Who are at risk?Older people, children and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk.What is the cure?There are no specific vaccines or treatments for human WNV disease. The best way to avoid WNV is to prevent mosquito bites. Treatment is supportive for patients with neuro-invasive West Nile virus, often involving hospitalization, intravenous fluids, respiratory support, and prevention of secondary infections.Scientists have said that milder temperatures attributed to climate change could cause diseases such as the WNV to become more widespread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-warns-of-increase-in-cases-of-west-nile-virus-all-you-need-to-know-101630322044172.html

He said two women and a child were wounded in that attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-calls-us-drone-strike-arbitrary-report-101630315657521.html

Variant, C.1.2, they warn, could be more transmissible and avoid protection offered by Covid-19 vaccines.Scientists from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and their counterparts from the KwaZulu Natal Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP) have called the C.1.2 a "potential variant of interest," which, they say, was first found in South Africa in May this year.Since then, the variant has also been located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mauritius, China, England, New Zealand, Portugal and Switzerland, the researchers claimed, adding that C.1.2 has more mutations than other variants of concern (VoC) and variants of interest (VoI) which have been detected globally till now.Their study, which is yet to be peer reviewed and was posted on the pre-print repository MedRxiv on August 24, further noted that the number of available sequences of C.1.2 may be an "underrepresentation" of the spread and frequency of the variant in South Africa, as well as across the world. It also found what it described as a "consistent" rise in the number of genomes of this new variant each month in the African nation, rising from 0.2 per cent of genomes sequenced in May to 1.6 per cent in June and, finally, to 2 per cent in July.The authors of the research termed this rise as being "similar" to the increases observed with the Beta and Delta variants in South Africa during the early stages of their detection.They also explained how C.1.2 evades protection offered by Covid-19 vaccines. "The mutations N440K an Y449H, which are associated with immune escape from certain antibodies, have been found in C.1.2 sequencing. These mutations combine with changes in other parts of the virus likely aid the latter in avoiding antibodies. This is true also for patients who have already developed antibodies for Beta and Delta variants," they wrote.According to Johns Hopkins University, South Africa, in the last 28 days, has logged 308,747 cases of the coronavirus disease. The county's cumulative infection tally stands at 2,764,931 including 81,595 related deaths.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/c12-new-variant-of-sars-cov-2-detected-in-south-africa-researchers-say-101630313058682.html
30-08-2021||World||ETIM may shift to ISKP with Taliban-China alliance over Xinjiang||With the US completely handing over Kabul and the country to the Sunni Pashtun Islamists on August 31, the fundamental question from the Indian perspective is whether Afghanistan will stabilize under the American army fatigue and M-4 carbine carrying Taliban or the latest Islamic emirate will still carry the burden of history and remain unstable as ever. UK, Soviets and now US have burnt their hands in Afghanistan and presumably have no appetite for any military adventure in that country. Will China with its client state Pakistan, the mother of Taliban and all assorted terrorist groups, will be able to capitalize on the situation with the former exploiting the mineral resources of Afghanistan under the garb of Belt Road Initiative (BRI) and Rawalpindi getting its so-called strategic depth against India?Despite Beijing’s tremendous financial and military clout and its hold on the Pakistan’s military and civilian set-up, the answer to the above questions is no as Afghanistan has been and will be hopelessly split on tribal and ethnic lines and there are fractures within the ultra-conservative Pashtuns. Already, there are intelligence reports coming about infighting in Kandahar among the Taliban leadership for the share of political pie in Kabul.While the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) unlike the US and Soviets is not expected cross the Rubicon by becoming political or militarily active in Afghanistan, it will surely use its new friend, the Taliban, for taking action against some 500 East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) fighters whose goal is to liberate Xinjiang Uighurs from the yoke of Beijing. The ETIM fighters are mostly located in Badakshan province in north Afghanistan which links with Xinjiang in China via the Wakhan corridor. Even though the Taliban have traditionally a close relationship with the ETIM, the Pashtuns are concentrated in south and its is the minority Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras, Uighur and Chechen who comprise the bulk of Taliban cadre in north Afghanistan. If the Taliban start harassing the Afghan minorities, it is these non-Pashtun elements who will join the core of Panjshir resistance in future. Already, intelligence reports from Afghanistan and Turkey indicate that the ETIM group will shift its allegiance to Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP) as they fear Taliban will act against them and hand them over to the MSS, the Chinese secret service. It is for this very reason that China wants US to redesignate ETIM as a global terrorist group, which is rather rich for a country that sat on the UN designation of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar as global terrorist for nearly three years.The other Chinese interest in Taliban regime in Kabul is to ask the Islamist leadership of Sunni Pashtun force to put pressure on their blood brother, the Tehreek-e-Taliban, across the Durand line to buy peace for their CPEC project in Pakistan. While the TTP is attacking the Chinese nationals involved in CPEC projects in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) and Occupied Kashmir, the Balochistan insurgents are militarily taking on both the Chinese and the Pakistanis in the Gwadar deep sea project. While the TTP has sworn allegiance (Bayat) to Taliban’s never to be seen supreme leader Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada, it has made it amply clear that it will continue to target the Rawalpindi GHQ from within Pakistan and does not need the safe terror sanctuary of Afghanistan.China’s client state Pakistan may be gloating about Taliban breaking the shackles of slavery by humiliating the US forces in Afghanistan, but the future does not look so rosy for Islamabad as billions of dollars’ worth of aid in the name of war against terror from west will dry up. US and West were giving aid and grants to Pakistan, China gives only loans and that too on a souped-up interest rate and collaterals.While Pakistan may get deniability of terror attacks against India by allowing all terror factories to shift to Afghanistan under Taliban, the economic and military gap between New Delhi and Islamabad is ever widening under the Modi regime and there is a sea change from India of the 1990s. With the abrogation of article 370 and 35 A in August 2019, the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh is directly under control of the Central Government and the room for Pakistan supported Hurriyat and other local parties has nearly disappeared. To top it all, the Modi regime refuses to get black-mailed over Pakistan’s nuclear status and is ready to militarily respond to any terror attack inspired and orchestrated by Rawalpindi. Fact is that actually the strategic space for Pakistan has shrunk with China demanding its share of pie for CPEC and resurgent Taliban becoming the radicalizing force for not only all the Pashtuns on both sides of Durand Line, which is not recognized by Taliban, but also jihadists of all genre in the region. US is gone and the new Great Game has just begun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/etim-may-shift-to-iskp-with-taliban-china-alliance-over-xinjiang-101630304620049.html

30-08-2021||World||World needs to guide the Taliban in Afghanistan, China tells US||The international community including the US should “guide” the Taliban in Afghanistan, provide economic and humanitarian aid, stop the Afghan currency from depreciating and help maintain social stability, Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi has told secretary of state, Antony Blinken.“While respecting the sovereignty of Afghanistan, the US should take concrete action to help Afghanistan fight terrorism and stop violence, rather than playing double standards or fighting terrorism selectively,” Wang said in his second phone conversation with Blinken in two weeks on the situation in the country.Wang warned Blinken that the “hasty withdrawal” of international troops could allow terrorist groups to “regroup and come back stronger”.“The US, in particular, needs to work with the international community to provide Afghanistan with urgently-needed economic, livelihood and humanitarian assistance, help the new Afghan political structure maintain normal operation of government institutions, maintain social security and stability, curb currency depreciation and inflation, and embark on the journey of peaceful reconstruction at an early date,” Wang said, according to a report by the Xinhua news agency.Blinken, according to Xinhua, told Wang that Washington believes that the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) should speak in a “clear and unified voice” to show that the international community expects the Taliban to ensure the safe evacuation of foreign citizens in the aftermath of the US withdrawal.Blinken added that the UNSC should also be unified in telling the Taliban to “guarantee that Afghan territory cannot become a hotbed of terrorist attacks or a safe haven for terrorism”.In what was a clear rebuke of Washington’s decision to withdraw forces, Wang said the US side “clearly knows the causes of the current chaotic situation in Afghanistan”, adding that any action to be taken by the UNSC should contribute to easing tensions instead of intensifying them, and contribute to a smooth transition of the situation in Afghanistan rather than a return to turmoil.In a statement issued by the US state department, spokesperson Ned Price said Blinken and Wang spoke about “the importance of the international community holding the Taliban accountable for the public commitments they have made regarding the safe passage and freedom to travel for Afghans and foreign nationals”.The phone conversation - the Chinese state TV said was made at the invitation of Washington - amid a tirade of criticism launched by Beijing following the release of an US intelligence report into the origins of Covid-19 that China said “wrongly” claimed that Beijing was hindering the investigation and dismissed as “not scientifically credible”.The two diplomats also discussed US-China ties on Sunday, according to the Chinese statement.Wang said recent engagement between the two countries on Afghanistan and climate change show that dialogue and cooperation were better than confrontation. “China will consider how to engage with the US side based on the US attitude towards China,” Wang was quoted as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-needs-to-guide-the-taliban-in-afghanistan-china-tells-us-101630299402920.html

30-08-2021||World||New Zealand reports first death linked to Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine||New Zealand on Monday reported what authorities said was the country's first recorded death linked to the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine.The information was released by the health ministry following a review by an independent Covid-19 vaccine safety monitoring board of the death of a woman after receiving the vaccine. The ministry's statement did not give the woman's age.The board considered that the woman’s death was due to myocarditis, which is known to be a rare side effect of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, the statement said. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle that can limit the organ's ability to pump blood and can cause changes in heartbeat rhythms."This is the first case in New Zealand where a death in the days following vaccination has been linked to the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine," the health ministry said.The Pfizer media team in New Zealand did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment.The case has been referred to the coroner and the cause of death has not yet been determined, the health ministry said.The independent board, however, did consider that the myocarditis was probably because of the vaccination.The board also noted that there were other medical issues occurring at the same time which may have influenced the outcome following vaccination."The benefits of vaccination with the Pfizer Covd-19 vaccine continue to greatly outweigh the risk of both Covid-19 infection and vaccine side effects, including myocarditis," it added.So far the Pfizer/BioNTech, Janssen and AstraZeneca vaccines have been provisionally approved by New Zealand authorities. However, the Pfizer vaccine is the only vaccine that has been approved for rollout to the public.New Zealand is battling an outbreak of the Delta variant of Covid-19 after nearly six months of being virus free.It reported 53 new cases on Monday, taking the total number of infections in the current outbreak to 562.A nationwide lockdown was enforced earlier this month to beat the spread of the Delta variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-reports-first-death-linked-to-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-101630295629308.html

30-08-2021||World||1st death from Hurricane Ida; power out across New Orleans||Hurricane Ida blasted ashore Sunday as one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the US, knocking out power to all of New Orleans, blowing roofs off buildings and reversing the flow of the Mississippi River as it rushed from the Louisiana coast into one of the nation’s most important industrial corridors.The hurricane was blamed for at least one death. The Ascension Parish Sheriff's Office said on Facebook that deputies responded to a home in Prairieville on a report of someone injured by a fallen tree. The person, who was not identified, was pronounced dead. Prairieville is a suburb of Baton Rouge, Louisiana’s capital city.The power outage in New Orleans heightened the city's vulnerability to flooding and left hundreds of thousands of people without air conditioning and refrigeration in sweltering summer heat.Ida — a Category 4 storm — hit on the same date Hurricane Katrina ravaged Louisiana and Mississippi 16 years earlier, coming ashore about 45 miles (72 kilometers) west of where Category 3 Katrina first struck land. Ida’s 150-mph (230 kph) winds tied it for the fifth-strongest hurricane to ever hit the mainland U.S. It dropped hours later to a Category 2 storm with maximum winds of 105 mph (165 kph) as it crawled inland, its eye about 40 miles (65 kilometers) west-northwest of New Orleans.The rising ocean swamped the barrier island of Grand Isle as landfall came just to the west at Port Fourchon. Ida made a second landfall about two hours later near Galliano. The hurricane was churning through the far southern Louisiana wetlands, with the more than 2 million people living in and around New Orleans and Baton Rouge under threat.“This is going to be much stronger than we usually see and, quite frankly, if you had to draw up the worst possible path for a hurricane in Louisiana, it would be something very, very close to what we’re seeing,” Gov. John Bel Edwards told The Associated Press.People in Louisiana woke up to a monster storm after Ida’s top winds grew by 45 mph (72 kph) in five hours as the hurricane moved through some of the warmest ocean water in the world in the northern Gulf of Mexico.The entire city of New Orleans late Sunday was without power, according to city officials. The city's power supplier — Entergy — confirmed that the only power in the city was coming from generators, the city’s Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Preparedness said on Twitter. The message included a screen shot that cited “catastrophic transmission damage” for the power failure.The city relies on Entergy for backup power for the pumps that remove storm water from city streets. Rain from Ida is expected to test that pump system.More than 1 million customers were without power in two Southern states impacted by Ida — more than 930,000 in Louisiana and 28,000 in Mississippi, according to PowerOutage.US, which tracks outages nationwide.In New Orleans, wind tore at awnings and caused buildings to sway and water to spill out of Lake Ponchartrain. The Coast Guard office in New Orleans received more than a dozen reports of breakaway barges, said Petty Officer Gabriel Wisdom. In Lafitte about 35 miles (55 km) south of New Orleans, a loose barge struck a bridge, according to Jefferson Parish officials.U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spokesman Ricky Boyette said engineers detected a “negative flow” on the Mississippi River as a result of storm surge. And Edwards said he watched a live video feed from around Port Fourchon as Ida came ashore that showed that roofs had been blown off buildings in “many places.”“The storm surge is just tremendous,” Edwards told the AP.Officials said Ida's swift intensification from a few thunderstorms to a massive hurricane in just three days left no time to organize a mandatory evacuation of New Orleans' 390,000 residents. Mayor LaToya Cantrell urged residents remaining in the city on Sunday to “hunker down."Marco Apostolico said he felt confident riding out the storm at his home in New Orleans' Lower 9th Ward, one of the city’s hardest-hit neighborhoods when levees failed and released a torrent of floodwater during Katrina.His home was among those rebuilt with the help of actor Brad Pitt to withstand hurricane-force winds. But the memory of Katrina still hung over the latest storm.“It’s obviously a lot of heavy feelings,” he said. “And yeah, potentially scary and dangerous.”The region getting Ida’s worst includes petrochemical sites and major ports, which could sustain significant damage. It is also an area that is already reeling from a resurgence of COVID-19 infections due to low vaccination rates and the highly contagious delta variant.New Orleans hospitals planned to ride out the storm with their beds nearly full, as similarly stressed hospitals elsewhere had little room for evacuated patients. And shelters for those fleeing their homes carried an added risk of becoming flashpoints for new infections.Forecasters warned winds stronger than 115 mph (185 kph) threatened Houma, a city of 33,000 that supports oil platforms in the Gulf.The hurricane was also threatening neighboring Mississippi, where Katrina demolished oceanfront homes. With Ida approaching, Claudette Jones evacuated her home east of Gulfport, Mississippi, as waves started pounding the shore.“I’m praying I can go back to a normal home like I left,” she said. “That’s what I’m praying for. But I’m not sure at this point.”Comparisons to the Aug. 29, 2005, landfall of Katrina weighed heavily on residents bracing for Ida. Katrina was blamed for 1,800 deaths as it caused levee breaches and catastrophic flooding in New Orleans. Ida’s hurricane-force winds stretched 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the storm’s eye, or about half the size of Katrina, and a New Orleans' infrastructure official emphasized that the city is in a “very different place than it was 16 years ago."The levee system has been massively overhauled since Katrina, Ramsey Green, deputy chief administrative officer for infrastructure, said before the worst of the storm hit. While water may not penetrate levees, Green said if forecasts of up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain prove true, the city's underfunded and neglected network of pumps, underground pipes and surface canals likely won't be able to keep up.The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality was in contact with more than 1,500 oil refineries, chemical plants and other sensitive facilities and will respond to any reported pollution leaks or petroleum spills, agency spokesman Greg Langley said. He said the agency would deploy three mobile air-monitoring laboratories after the storm passes to sample, analyze and report any threats to public health.Louisiana’s 17 oil refineries account for nearly one-fifth of the U.S. refining capacity and its two liquefied natural gas export terminals ship about 55% of the nation’s total exports, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Government statistics show that 95% of oil and gas production in the Gulf Coast region was shut down as Ida made landfall on Sunday, according to energy company S&P Global Platts.Louisiana is also home to two nuclear power plants, one near New Orleans and another about 27 miles (about 43 kilometers) northwest of Baton Rouge.President Joe Biden approved emergency declarations for Louisiana and Mississippi ahead of Ida’s arrival. He said Sunday the country was praying for the best for Louisiana and would put its “full might behind the rescue and recovery” effort once the storm passes.Edwards warned his state to brace for potentially weeks of recovery.“Many, many people are going to be tested in ways that we can only imagine today,” the governor told a news conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1st-death-from-hurricane-ida-power-out-across-new-orleans-101630293651953.html
30-08-2021||World||Rockets fly across Kabul as US evacuations wind down||Rockets flew across the Afghan capital on Monday as the United States raced to complete its withdrawal from Afghanistan, with the evacuation of civilians all but over and terror attack fears high.President Joe Biden has set a deadline of Tuesday to withdraw all US forces from Afghanistan, drawing to a close his nation's longest military conflict, which began in retaliation for the September 11 attacks.The return of the hardline Islamist Taliban movement, which was toppled in 2001 but took back power a fortnight ago, triggered an exodus of terrified people aboard US-led evacuation flights.Also Read| Several children killed in US drone strike on IS in Afghanistan: ReportsThose flights, which took more than 114,000 people out of Kabul airport, will officially end on Tuesday when the last of the thousands of American troops pull out.But US forces are now focused chiefly on flying themselves and American diplomats out safely.The Islamic State group, rivals of the Taliban, pose the biggest threat to the withdrawal after carrying out a suicide bomb attack at the airport late last week that claimed more than 100 lives, including 13 US troops.Biden had warned more attacks were highly likely, and the United States said it carried out an air strike on Sunday night in Kabul on an explosives-laden vehicle.That was followed on Monday morning by the sound of rockets flying across Kabul, according to AFP journalists in the city.People living near the airport said they heard the sounds of the missile defensive system being activated.Smoke could be seen rising near the airport.A Taliban spokesman confirmed Sunday's incident, saying a car bomb destined for the airport had been destroyed -- and that a possible second strike had hit a nearby house.The United States has been accused of killing many civilians in air strikes throughout the war, one reason for losing local support, and that was again a possibility on Sunday.Also Read| Want good India-Afghanistan relations, says Taliban leader"We are aware of reports of civilian casualties following our strike on a vehicle in Kabul today," Captain Bill Urban, a US Central Command spokesman, said in a statement.Urban said the US military was investigating whether civilians were killed, noting there were "powerful" explosions that resulted from the destruction of the vehicle."We would be deeply saddened by any potential loss of innocent life," he said.In recent years, the Islamic State's Afghanistan-Pakistan chapter has been responsible for some of the deadliest attacks in those countries.They have massacred civilians at mosques, public squares, schools, and even hospitals.Also Read| 'Went into hiding, lost relatives': How Afghan soldier's life changed in 15 daysWhile both IS and the Taliban are hardline Sunni Islamists, they are bitter foes -- with each claiming to be the true flag-bearers of jihad.Last week's suicide bombing at the airport led to the worst single-day death toll for the US military in Afghanistan since 2011.The IS threat has forced the US military and the Taliban to co-operate in ensuring security at the airport in a way unthinkable just weeks ago.On Saturday, Taliban fighters escorted a steady stream of Afghans from buses to the main passenger terminal, handing them over to US forces for evacuation.Taliban leaderThe Taliban have promised a softer brand of rule compared with their first stint in power, which the US military ended because they gave sanctuary to Al-Qaeda.But many Afghans fear a repeat of the Taliban's brutal interpretation of Islamic law, as well as violent retribution for working with foreign militaries, Western missions or the previous US-backed government.Western allies have warned many thousands of at-risk Afghans have not been able to get on the evacuation flights.On Sunday, the Taliban revealed their supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada was in southern Afghanistan and planning to make a public appearance."He is present in Kandahar. He has been living there from the very beginning," said Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid."He will soon appear in public," added deputy spokesman Bilal Karimi of the leader, whose whereabouts have remained largely unknown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-crisis-rockets-fly-across-kabul-as-us-evacuations-wind-down-101630292311564.html

Notably, Ida hit the Gulf Coast on the 16th anniversary of the disastrous Hurricane Katrina.Speaking at a Sunday meeting of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Biden said that Ida was a "life-threatening" storm."Its devastation is likely to be immense, we shouldn't kid ourselves ... Everyone should listen to the instructions from local and state officials, just how dangerous this is, and take it seriously," Biden said, adding that the states of Louisiana, Alabama and Michigan will get the "full resources of the federal government."On Sunday, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell spoke with government and state officials from Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi to update them on the Biden administration's preparations for Hurricane Ida, promising assistance and help in local emergency response efforts.Also Read| Hurricane Ida lashes Louisiana, knocking out power in New OrleansBiden visited FEMA's National Response Coordination Center on Sunday (local time). On Saturday (local time), he spoke with Criswel, while the day earlier the president spoke with the Governors of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, promising full support.According to the White House, in advance of the storm, over 2,400 FEMA employees were deployed and the agency has also prepositioned millions of meals and liters of water, as well as tarps, generators, and additional ambulances. Shelters have been opened across the impacted states and the US Coast Guard has already positioned vessels and aircraft for search and rescue efforts.Also Read| Greenpiece: Lessons to be learnt from hurricane IdaBiden approved emergency disaster declarations for Louisiana and Mississippi on Friday and Saturday, respectively, authorizing direct federal help, including power generation. More than 504,000 Louisiana residents were without power on Sunday afternoon as Hurricane Ida began moving over the New Orleans area, according to poweroutage.us. The Mississippi River in New Orleans partially reversed its flow on Sunday, according to data from the US Geological Survey (USGS).Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards warned on Saturday that Ida could become one of the strongest storms to hit the US state since the 1850s, while New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell urged people to self-evacuate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prez-biden-says-hurricane-ida-likely-to-be-immense-promises-full-federal-aid-101630289704269.html
30-08-2021||World||Hurricane Ida lashes Louisiana, knocking out power in New Orleans||Hurricane Ida, making landfall as a fierce Category 4 storm, plowed into Louisiana from the Gulf Mexico on Sunday, lashing the coast with 150 mile-per-hour winds, torrential downpours and pounding surf that submerged much of the shoreline under several feet of water.All of New Orleans, Louisiana's most populous city, had power knocked out due to "catastrophic transmission damage," the local utility reported, hours after flash-flood warnings were posted.Sixteen years to the day after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, Ida slammed ashore around noon near Port Fourchon, Louisiana, a hub of the Gulf's offshore energy industry, blasting the coast with hurricane-force winds extending 50 miles (80 km) out from the eye of the storm.Residents of the most vulnerable coastal areas were ordered to evacuate days in advance. But those riding out the storm in their homes in New Orleans, less than 100 miles inland to the north, braced for the toughest test yet of major upgrades to a levee system constructed following devastating floods in 2005 from Katrina."I almost found myself in a panic attack when news announced this was the anniversary of Katrina," Janet Rucker, a lifelong New Orleans resident and recently retired sales manager who took shelter in a downtown hotel with her dog, Deuce. "This is just not good for our nerves and our psyche."The storm's approach also forced the suspension of emergency medical services in New Orleans and elsewhere across a state already reeling from a fourth wave of Covid-19 infections that has strained Louisiana's healthcare system.For an estimated 2,450 Covid-19 patients hospitalized statewide, many in intensive care units, evacuation was not an option.A loss of generator power at the Thibodaux Regional Health System hospital in Lafourche Parish, southwest of New Orleans, forced medical workers to manually assist respirator patients with breathing while they were moved to another floor, the state Health Department confirmed to Reuters.Farren Clark, a Nicholls State University professor who studied Katrina's impact and was riding out the storm at his mother's home in Thibodaux, called the arrival of Ida "nerve-wracking.""I can hear the howl of the storm getting stronger," he told Reuters by phone. "Having done research on Katrina, it is a little bit triggering."Michael Lewis, 45, restaurant owner in nearby Houma, said he could see shingles blown off his roof and a downed fence through a window of his home but was unable to check the full extent of damage as the storm raged."It's way too dangerous to go outside right now," he said in a phone interview.Officials of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said they expected the city's newly reinforced levees to hold, though they said they said the flood walls could be overtopped in some places."This is one of the strongest storms to make landfall here in modern times," Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said at a news briefing.Hundreds of miles of new levees were built around New Orleans after flooding from Katrina inundated much of the low-lying city, especially historically Black neighborhoods. That monster storm claimed more than 1,800 lives.Edwards voiced confidence in the billions of dollars in levee improvements since then, saying they were "built for this moment."WIDESPREAD OUTAGESPower outages were widespread in the first hours of the storm, with more than 750,000 Louisiana homes and businesses losing electricity by Sunday night, according to state utility Entergy Louisiana."As soon the storm passes, we're going to put the country's full might behind the rescue and recovery," President Joe Biden said after a briefing at the Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Washington.Biden earlier said 500 federal emergency response workers were standing by in Texas and Louisiana.Just three days after emerging as a tropical storm in the Caribbean Sea, Ida had intensified into a Category 4 hurricane and swept ashore with top sustained winds of 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour), the National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported.Within hours, as Ida crept closer to New Orleans, its sustained winds had diminished to 120 mph, ranking it as a Category 3 storm but one still considered a life-threatening major hurricane, according to the NHC.Palm trees trembled as rain blasted in sideways through New Orleans on Sunday, where retiree Robert Ruffin, 68, had evacuated with his family to a downtown hotel."I thought it was safer," he said. "It's double-trouble this time because of Covid."Inundation from Ida's storm surge - high surf driven by the hurricane's winds - was reported to be exceeding predicted levels of 6 feet (1.83 m) along parts of the coast. Videos posted on social media showed storm surge flooding had transformed sections of Highway 90 along the Louisiana and Mississippi coast into a choppy river.The NHC also warned of potentially catastrophic wind damage and up to 2 feet (61 cm) of rainfall in some areas.The governor warned it could take 72 hours for emergency responders to arrive to hard-hit places. Some parishes imposed curfews beginning Sunday evening."We're as prepared as we can be, but we're worried about those levees," said Kirk Lepine, president of Plaquemines Parish, and one of the most vulnerable areas along Gulf Coast.The parish later issued an alert on Facebook urging residents of one area to seek higher ground after reports of an overtopped levee."Everyone who cares about New Orleans is worried," said Andy Horowitz, a history professor who wrote "Katrina: A History, 1915-2015." Horowitz fled to Alabama with his family from their home near New Orleans' French Quarter.Offshore energy operations in the region were at a virtual standstill. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) said nearly 300 offshore oil and gas platforms were evacuated, cutting Gulf-based petroleum and natural gas production by 96% and 94%, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-ida-lashes-louisiana-knocking-out-power-in-new-orleans-101630290702340.html

The cable relayed reports of staffers being harassed, being spat on and cursed at by Taliban fighters at checkpoints."Our local staff and their families have suffered hardship, pain and loss because of their dedication to working with us to build a better future for all Afghans. We have a special commitment to them because of that," a State Department spokesperson had said.The United States and its partner countries in a joint statement on Sunday reaffirmed their commitment to ensuring the safe travel of their citizens and at-risk Afghans outside Afghanistan.Since August 14, the US has evacuated and facilitated the evacuation of approximately 114,400 people. Since the end of July, the US has relocated approximately 120,000 people.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday had said that the US will be engaging with the Taliban to ensure the safe evacuation of people from Afghanistan following the August 31 deadline for withdrawal,"The President directed the Secretary of State to continue diplomatic efforts with international partners to secure means for third-country nationals and Afghans with visas to leave the country even after the US military presence ends," Psaki had said during a press briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-has-evacuated-all-afghan-embassy-staff-report-101630283805613.html
30-08-2021||World||Several children killed in US drone strike on IS in Afghanistan: Reports||Several Afghans, including children, were killed in a drone strike in Afghanistan's Kabul on Sunday that the US said killed an Islamic State suicide car bomber suspected of preparing to attack the airport in the capital city, according to reports. CNN reported citing relatives and a local journalist that nine members of one family, including six children, were killed in the strike targeting a vehicle in a residential neighbourhood of Kabul. The youngest child was a two-year-old girl, the brother of one of the dead told a local journalist working with CNN."All the neighbours tried to help and brought water to put out the fire and I saw that there were five or six people dead. The father of the family and another young boy and there were two children. They were dead. They were in pieces. There were [also] two wounded,” Ahad, who said he was a neighbour of the family, told CNN.The Associated Press reported citing an unnamed official in Afghanistan that three children were killed in the drone strike on Sunday.Also watch | Afghan children killed in US drone strike? | Rocket attack bid at Kabul airportAfter the CNN report, the United States said it is investigating whether civilians may have been killed in the airstrike and that it would be “deeply saddened by any potential loss of innocent life". "We are aware of reports of civilian casualties following our strike on a vehicle in Kabul today. We are still assessing the results of this strike, which we know disrupted an imminent ISIS-K threat to the airport,” Captain Bill Urban, a Central Command (CENTCOM) spokesperson, said in a statement.He was using an acronym for the Afghanistan branch of the Islamic State group, which carried out a suicide attack at the airport on Thursday.Also read | Afghan TV anchor relays Taliban message surrounded by armed fighters"We know that there were substantial and powerful subsequent explosions resulting from the destruction of the vehicle, indicating a large amount of explosive material inside that may have caused additional casualties," Urban continued. "It is unclear what may have happened, and we are investigating further.”According to officials, a US drone strike blew up a vehicle carrying “multiple suicide bombers” from Afghanistan's Islamic State affiliate on Sunday before they could attack the ongoing military evacuation at Kabul's international airport. The strike was the second carried out by US forces in Afghanistan since an Islamic State suicide bomber struck the airport on Thursday, killing 13 US troops and scores of Afghan civilians trying to flee the country.Also read | Want good India-Afghanistan relations, says Taliban leaderTwo US military officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations, called the airstrike successful and said the vehicle carried multiple bombers.US navy Captain Bill Urban, a military spokesperson, said the strike was carried out in “self-defence” and that the military was investigating whether there were civilian casualties but that “we have no indications at this time.”“We are confident we successfully hit the target. Significant secondary explosions from the vehicle indicated the presence of a substantial amount of explosive material,” Urban said.Sunday’s drone strike came just two days before the US is set to withdraw the last of its troops, ending America's longest war.Meanwhile, the US state department said in a statement signed by around 100 countries, as well as Nato and the European Union, that they received “assurances” from the Taliban that people with travel documents would still be able to leave the country. The Taliban have said they will allow normal travel after the US withdrawal is completed on Tuesday and they assume control of the airport.Also read | Committed to safe passage of citizens, Afghan allies, say US and other nationsUS President Joe Biden vowed to keep up the airstrikes, saying on Saturday that another attack was “highly likely” as the state department called the threat “specific” and “credible.”The Taliban have increased security around the airport after Thursday's attack, clearing away the large crowds that had gathered outside the gates hoping to join the airlift.Tens of thousands of Afghans are trying to flee Afghanistan since the Taliban's rapid takeover earlier this month, fearing reprisals and a return to the harsh form of Islamic rule the group imposed by the group from 1996 to 2001.The Taliban have pledged amnesty for all Afghans, even those who worked with the US and its allies. But many Afghans are sceptical about the assurances and there have been reports of executions and other human rights abuses in areas under the Taliban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/several-children-killed-in-us-drone-strike-on-is-in-afghanistan-reports-101630282601336.html
30-08-2021||World||Wind, storm surge from Hurricane Ida lash Louisiana||Hurricane Ida blasted ashore Sunday as one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the US, blowing off roofs and reversing the flow of the Mississippi River as it rushed from the Louisiana coast toward New Orleans and one of the nation’s most important industrial corridors.The Category 4 storm hit on the same date Hurricane Katrina ravaged Louisiana and Mississippi 16 years earlier, coming ashore about 45 miles (72 kilometers) west of where Category 3 Katrina first struck land. Ida’s 150-mph (230 kph) winds tied it for the fifth-strongest hurricane to ever hit the mainland U.S. It dropped hours later to a Category 3 storm with maximum winds of 125 mph (200 kph) as it inched closer to New Orleans.The rising ocean swamped the barrier island of Grand Isle as landfall came just to the west at Port Fourchon. Ida made a second landfall about two hours later near Galliano. The hurricane was churning through the far southern Louisiana wetlands, with the more than 2 million people living in and around New Orleans and Baton Rouge under threat.“This is going to be much stronger than we usually see and, quite frankly, if you had to draw up the worst possible path for a hurricane in Louisiana, it would be something very, very close to what we’re seeing,” Gov. John Bel Edwards told The Associated Press.People in Louisiana woke up to a monster storm after Ida’s top winds grew by 45 mph (72 kph) in five hours as the hurricane moved through some of the warmest ocean water in the world in the northern Gulf of Mexico.Wind tore at awnings, water spilled out of Lake Ponchartrain in New Orleans, and boats broke loose from their moorings. Engineers detected a “negative flow” on the Mississippi River as a result of storm surge, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spokesman Ricky Boyette said.Edwards said he watched a live video feed from around Port Fourchon as Ida came ashore.“The storm surge is just tremendous. We can see the roofs have been blown off of the port buildings in many places,” Edwards told the AP.Officials said Ida's swift intensification from a few thunderstorms to a massive hurricane in just three days left no time to organize a mandatory evacuation of New Orleans' 390,000 residents. Mayor LaToya Cantrell urged residents remaining in the city on Sunday to “hunker down."Marco Apostolico said he felt confident riding out the storm at his home in New Orleans' Lower 9th Ward, one of the city’s hardest-hit neighborhoods when levees failed and released a torrent of floodwater during Katrina.His home was among those rebuilt with the help of actor Brad Pitt to withstand hurricane-force winds. But the memory of Katrina still hung over the latest storm.“It’s obviously a lot of heavy feelings,” he said. “And yeah, potentially scary and dangerous.”The region getting Ida’s worst includes petrochemical sites and major ports, which could sustain significant damage. It is also an area that is already reeling from a resurgence of COVID-19 infections due to low vaccination rates and the highly contagious delta variant.New Orleans hospitals planned to ride out the storm with their beds nearly full, as similarly stressed hospitals elsewhere had little room for evacuated patients. And shelters for those fleeing their homes carried an added risk of becoming flashpoints for new infections.Forecasters warned winds stronger than 115 mph (185 kph) threatened Houma, a city of 33,000 that supports oil platforms in the Gulf.The hurricane was also threatening neighboring Mississippi, where Katrina demolished oceanfront homes. With Ida approaching, Claudette Jones evacuated her home east of Gulfport, Mississippi, as waves started pounding the shore.“I’m praying I can go back to a normal home like I left,” she said. “That’s what I’m praying for. But I’m not sure at this point.”Comparisons to the Aug. 29, 2005, landfall of Katrina weighed heavily on residents bracing for Ida. Katrina was blamed for 1,800 deaths as it caused levee breaches and catastrophic flooding in New Orleans. Ida’s hurricane-force winds stretched 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the storm’s eye, or about half the size of Katrina, and a New Orleans' infrastructure official emphasized that the city is in a “very different place than it was 16 years ago."The levee system has been massively overhauled since Katrina, Ramsey Green, deputy chief administrative officer for infrastructure, said before the worst of the storm hit. While water may not penetrate levees, Green said if forecasts of up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain prove true, the city's underfunded and neglected network of pumps, underground pipes and surface canals likely won't be able to keep up.About 590,000 customers were already without power late Sunday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.US, which tracks outages nationwide.The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality was in contact with more than 1,500 oil refineries, chemical plants and other sensitive facilities and will respond to any reported pollution leaks or petroleum spills, agency spokesman Greg Langley said. He said the agency would deploy three mobile air-monitoring laboratories after the storm passes to sample, analyze and report any threats to public health.Louisiana’s 17 oil refineries account for nearly one-fifth of the U.S. refining capacity and its two liquefied natural gas export terminals ship about 55% of the nation’s total exports, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Government statistics show that 95% of oil and gas production in the Gulf Coast region was shut down as Ida made landfall on Sunday, according to energy company S&P Global Platts.Louisiana is also home to two nuclear power plants, one near New Orleans and another about 27 miles (about 43 kilometers) northwest of Baton Rouge.President Joe Biden approved emergency declarations for Louisiana and Mississippi ahead of Ida’s arrival.
