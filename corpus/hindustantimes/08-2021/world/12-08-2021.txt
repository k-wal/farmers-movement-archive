People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the three engineers were at a dam site in a Taliban controlled area. Further details of the emergency air rescue, such as the area and when it was carried out, could not immediately be ascertained. The security advisory from the Indian embassy was the fourth such alert issued since June 29 and reiterated the call for Indian nationals in Afghanistan to make immediate arrangements to return home via commercial air services. It also reiterated a warning to avoid non-essential travel because of a serious threat of kidnapping. The advisory pointed to the case of the three Indian engineers and said those ignoring the embassy’s advisories were putting themselves in “mortal danger”. “A recent case that required emergency air rescue of three Indian engineers who remained at a dam project site, in an area not under the control of government forces, has brought to light that Indian nationals receiving this embassy’s advisories are not heeding its advice and continue to put themselves in mortal danger,” the alert said. The Indian embassy underscored the “need for all Indian nationals to fully adhere to steps” in previous security advisories. It also referred to the killing of photo-journalist Danish Siddiqui by the Taliban in the border town of Spin Boldak on July 16 and said Indian reporters visiting Afghanistan faced additional risks. “Special attention is once again drawn to members of the Indian media arriving in Afghanistan for ground reporting. As a recent tragic incident demonstrated, the public profile of Indian journalists in Afghanistan entails additional risks,” the advisory said. The embassy advised members of the Indian media to take “additional security measures for their stay and movements inside Afghanistan, including tying up of interviews and planned coverage before arrival in Afghanistan”. Indian reporters travelling to Afghanistan should also identify well established security logistic firms who can make arrangements for their stay and movement, it added. Reports emerging after Siddiqui’s death have suggested he was captured and killed by the Taliban. According to information provided by the government in Parliament last week, there were some 1,500 Indian nationals in Afghanistan. Officials said this figure has come down as many Indians have returned in recent days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/air-rescue-for-3-indian-engineers-who-remained-at-dam-site-in-taliban-controlled-area-101628791908655.html

Citing the emergency air rescue operation at a Dam project site, the embassy warned that Indian nationals are not following its security advisories and continue to put themselves in mortal danger."A recent case that required emergency air rescue of three Indian engineers who remained at a dam project site, in an area not under the control of government forces, has brought to light that Indian nationals receiving this embassy's advisories are not heeding its advice and continue to put themselves in mortal danger," the embassy said in a fresh advisory.The Indian embassy in Kabul had issued three separate advisories on June 29, July 24 and August 10 over the evolving situation in Afghanistan as the Taliban continues its offensive against government forces and civilians. It stated that the previous advisories remain valid, requesting all Indian nationals to strictly adhere to the measures advocated."Embassy of India Kabul once again underscores the need for all Indian nationals to fully adhere to steps in the security advisories provided from time to time," the new advisory said.In an apparent reference to the killing of Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Danish Siddiqui in Kandahar, the embassy also highlighted the additional security risks that entail Indian journalists.“It is therefore advised that members of the Indian media should take additional security measures for their stay and movements inside Afghanistan including tying up of interviews and planned coverage before arrival in Afghanistan, as well as identifying well-established security logistic firms who can make necessary security arrangements for stay and movement of the journalists,” the advisory said.On Tuesday, India requested its citizens in and around Mazar-e-Sharif to board a special flight leaving for New Delhi as the Taliban advanced to seize the fourth largest Afghan city. It had also advised all Indian citizens in Afghanistan to make immediate travel arrangements to return home before commercial air services are discontinued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-embassy-in-kabul-says-citizens-not-following-advisories-after-3-engineers-rescued-101628790671388.html
12-08-2021||World||Spain battles wildfires as heatwave kicks in||Firefighters battled three wildfires in Spain on Thursday as a heatwave that has enveloped southeastern Europe in recent days shifted west towards the Iberian peninsula.Dozens of firefighters backed by four water-dropping aircraft were on the scene of a blaze in the northeastern province of Tarragona which has so far destroyed some 40 hectares (100 acres) of protected forest, local officials said.Two smaller fires were burning in the northern wine-producing region of La Rioja and the northeastern province of Zaragoza, which involved two planes.The wildfires come as temperatures were forecast to reach highs of around 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in much of Spain and neighbouring Portugal in the coming days.The mercury could hit the mid-40s in some areas of southern Spain.Scientists say global temperature rises powered by manmade climate change will make heatwaves more frequent and more intense, and their impact more widespread.A heatwave fed by hot air from North Africa has engulfed large parts of the Mediterranean region in recent days, contributing to massive wildfires and killing dozens of people in Italy, Turkey, Greece and Algeria.All but three of Spain's 17 regions were on alert for heat while Portugal's weather office warned that the centre and north of the country as well as parts of the southern Algarve province were on "maximum" alert for wildfires.In 2017, fires killed dozens of people in Portugal.Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa urged people to avoid "risky behaviours" which could cause wildfires."We know that the next few days are going to be difficult," he told reporters on Thursday during a visit to a civil protection headquarters."We are facing a permanent challenge that is the result of climate change," he added.Spain's northeastern Catalonia region on Thursday banned camping in forests and sporting activities in rural areas to reduce the risk of wildfires.It also prohibited the use of some farm equipment during the hottest hours of the day.For the first time since 1920, temperatures are forecast to soar above 40 degrees Celsius for three consecutive days at Madrid's central Retiro park, tweeted Ruben del Campo, the spokesman for Spain's national weather office AEMET.The number of heatwaves registered in Spain between 2011 and 2020 is double the number recorded in each of the three previous decades, he told AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-battles-wildfires-as-heatwave-kicks-in-101628789823539.html

Herat is the country’s third-largest city and is among the recent regions which fell to Taliban forces in the aftermath of the United States pulling out its troops from the war-torn nation.The Taliban released a statement confirming that it captured Herat’s police headquarters, news agencies ANI and Sputnik said. News agency Al Jazeera, too, reported that Taliban terrorists entered Kandahar. Local residents while speaking to Al Jazeera highlighted the plight faced by them and some residents said that Afghanistan's second-largest city was ‘dire’. Intense fighting continued between Taliban and the army inside Kandahar.Taliban on Thursday also captured the 10th provincial city of Ghazni. Despite being part of a peace deal where the United States and the Afghanistan government are also stakeholders, Taliban have unleashed atrocities on the citizens of Afghanistan.The Taliban forces now control two-thirds of the country and a US official report says that capital Kabul could bow down to Taliban pressure within 30 days, leading to the faction gaining full control of the nation within a few months. It currently has taken control of 11 of Afghanistan's 34 provincial capitals.The United Nations said that Taliban terrorists have killed more than 1,000 civilians and wounded 4,042 people. India has also expressed concern regarding the situation in Afghanistan and is ready for all kinds of situations.

In a July 2020 decision, the high court said Mehta needed to redo his legal analysis and weight the House's needs for Trump's financial records against the burden such a request puts on the former president.Mehta's ruling from this week did that, and it was a split decision. He said Trump's accounting firm, Mazars, should turn over financial documents to the House committee but not all of the records the panel had sought.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-appeals-ruling-that-us-house-can-see-financial-records-101628788153463.html

Govt answers||India is closely monitoring all the developments regarding Hindu and Sikh minorities living in Afghanistan, the ministry of external affairs said on Thursday as the situation in the war-torn region continues to deteriorate with the Taliban making rapid gains. Citing the earlier efforts by the government to protect the minorities in Afghanistan, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a weekly press briefing that the Indian embassy in Kabul is in touch with the Hindus and Sikhs residing in Afghanistan.“Last year, our mission in Kabul had facilitated the return of 383 members of the Sikh and Hindu communities in Afghanistan. Our mission continues to remain in touch with the Afghan Hindu and Sikh community members and we will ensure the provision of all necessary assistance to them,” Bagchi said.Last week, the Taliban allegedly removed Nishan Sahib, a Sikh religious flag, from a gurdwara in eastern Afghanistan, but was restored after widespread criticism. Puneet Singh Chandhok, president of the Indian World Forum, said the caretaker of the gurdwara informed him that several Talibs revisited the place and agreed to its “functioning as per customs,” reported news agency ANI.Also Read | Trump slams Biden, calls for ‘conditions-based’ Afghan exitAccording to a US report on international religious freedom in Afghanistan, approximately 200 Sikhs and Hindus fled to either India or Western countries in 2019 because of security threats and a “perceived lack of government protection.” In 2018, about 500-600 members of Hindu and Sikh communities left the country fearing religious persecution.“Their members continued to avoid settling disputes in the courts due to fear of retaliation and instead chose to settle disputes through community councils,” the report says.The gains made by the Taliban has renewed the security concerns for the religious minorities in Afghanistan.

12-08-2021||World||Vaccine partnerships, climate change on agenda of Quad key officials meet||Senior officials of the four members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad on Thursday discussed ways to take forward cooperation in areas such as infrastructure, maritime security and humanitarian aid in order to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific. The virtual meeting of officials from India, Australia, Japan and the US also reviewed progress in key areas such as the Quad vaccine partnership, critical and emerging technologies and climate change. During the grouping’s first summit in March, the Quad decided to set up working groups focused on these three areas. Thursday’s meeting was a follow-up to the meeting of foreign ministers on February 18 and the virtual Quad leaders’ summit on March 12. The external affairs ministry said the officials discussed the wide-ranging impact of Covid-19 in the Indo-Pacific and the importance of collaborative efforts to contain the pandemic and ensure health security and a quick economic recovery. The officials explored the possibility of collaboration in resilient supply chains, emerging and critical technologies, maritime security, cyber security, counter-terrorism, infrastructure and connectivity, higher education, climate change and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, the ministry added. Japan’s foreign ministry said in a readout that the officials concurred on advancing practical cooperation on these issues to achieve a free and open Indo-Pacific. The officials also exchanged views on regional issues such as the situation in North Korea, the East and South China Seas and Myanmar. A statement from the US state department said the “four democracies acknowledged that global security and prosperity depends on the region remaining inclusive, resilient, and healthy”. The officials also examined ways to advance cooperation such as strategic challenges confronting the region, countering disinformation, promoting democracy and human rights, strengthening international institutions such as the UN and related bodies, and “supporting countries vulnerable to coercive actions in the Indo-Pacific”, the US statement added. The Quad vaccine partnership was created to manufacture vaccines developed by the US in India with funding from the American and Japanese development banks. These jabs were to be distributed among developing countries across the Indo-Pacific with Australia’s logistics chain. The members of Quad were looking to start the distribution of the vaccines as early as the second quarter of this year, but these plans suffered a setback after India was hit hard by a second wave of Covid-19 infections in March and all vaccine stocks were repurposed for the domestic vaccination programme. The Quad members are now hoping to get the initiative rolling by early 2022, especially to counter China, which has taken the lead in delivering jabs to South and Southeast Asian countries either as donations or commercial supplies. During the meeting, the officials welcomed the fact that a free and open Indo-Pacific as a “vision for the peace and prosperity of the region and its importance in the post-Covid world is increasing”, the readout from Japan’s foreign ministry said. This vision has spread in the world community, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and Europe, and the officials reaffirmed the importance of broadening cooperation with more countries for its further achievement, the readout added. The officials reaffirmed their strong support for Asean’ unity and centrality and the Asean-led regional architecture, as well as full support for Asean’s Indo-Pacific policy. The officials agreed to work towards holding an in-person summit by the end of this year, as well as a foreign minister’s meeting at least once a year. The meeting was joined by Vani Rao, joint secretary (Americas) and Naveen Srivastava, additional secretary (East Asia) from the external affairs ministry, deputy minister for foreign policy Masataka Okano and deputy director general (Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau) Kazuya Endo from Japan’s foreign ministry, Justin Hayhurst, deputy secretary (Indo-Pacific Group) and Lauren Bain, assistant secretary (ASEAN and regional architecture branch) from Australia’s foreign ministry, and Richard Buangan from the bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs and Dean Thompson, acting assistant secretary (South and Central Asian Affairs) from the US state department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-partnerships-climate-change-on-agenda-of-quad-key-officials-meet-101628785847521.html
12-08-2021||World||Pakistani forces clash with Afghan protesters at border crossing shut by Taliban||Pakistani forces clashed on Thursday with hundreds of Afghans stranded on Pakistan's side of a commercially vital border crossing with Afghanistan after its closure by Taliban insurgents, Pakistani security officials said.The disturbances broke out after a 56-year-old Afghan traveller died of a heart attack as he waited in the dusty heat to enter Afghanistan via the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing, Arif Kakar, a Pakistani official on the scene, told Reuters.Protesters carried his body to a local Pakistani government office demanding the border be reopened. Some began throwing stones at security forces, who responded by firing tear gas and charging the protesters with batons to disperse them. No injuries were reported.The Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing is landlocked Afghanistan's second busiest entry point and main commercial artery to the Pakistani seacoast.The Taliban, who captured the crossing last month as part of a major advance across Afghanistan as U.S.-led foreign forces withdraw, announced its closure on Aug. 6 in protest at a Pakistani decision to end visa-free travel for Afghans.The hardline Islamist Taliban are demanding Pakistan allow Afghans to cross the frontier with either an Afghan ID card or a Pakistani-issued refugee registration card.Taliban fighters have rapidly taken territory from the Kabul government in recent weeks, including important border crossings with Iran and Central Asian countries that now provide significant customs revenue for the group.Some 900 trucks went through the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing daily before the Taliban seized it.Opening the border with Pakistan for visa-free travel would not only help the Taliban curry favour from ordinary Afghans but also shore up a route to areas of Pakistan that have housed Taliban fighters and some commanders.Pakistan and the Taliban long maintained good relations though Islamabad says this ended after the 2001 U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan that ousted the radical Islamists from power for having sheltered al Qaeda militants who carried out the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.Western capitals and the Kabul government say Pakistani support to the Taliban continues and many of its leaders enjoy safe haven in the country, something Islamabad denies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-forces-clash-with-afghan-protesters-at-border-crossing-shut-by-taliban-101628782183379.html
12-08-2021||World||Trump slams Biden, calls for ‘conditions-based’ Afghan exit||Former US president Donald Trump on Thursday joined growing criticism of President Joe Biden’s handling of the situation in Afghanistan, saying the withdrawal of US-led international forces should be based on conditions on the ground. He added that what is going on in the country is “not acceptable”. “If I were now President, the world would find that our withdrawal from Afghanistan would be a conditions-based,” Trump said. “I personally had discussions with top Taliban leaders whereby they understood what they are doing now would not have been acceptable,” Trump added, referring to negotiations that led to the signing of the accord with the Taliban in February 2020.President Biden, it must be noted, is implementing that same deal although he has publicly expressed reservations with it, saying it’s not something he would have negotiated. He only changed the exit date, from May end to August end, to be wrapped up by September 11, the 20th anniversary of 9/11 terrorist attacks that brought the US to Afghanistan.“It would have been a much different and much more successful withdrawal, and the Taliban understood that better than anyone,” Trump said further in a statement. “What is going on now is not acceptable. It should have been done much better.”President Biden has come under growing criticism at home and abroad for the summary withdrawal of US-led international troops that have continued at a rapid pace despite military advances made by the Taliban, who are now in control of ten provincial capitals, raising fears of the return of the barbaric regime that they led from 1996 to 2001, when they were overthrown by the US-led forces and Afghanistan militias.US officials estimate Kabul to fall to the Taliban in a month or two, according to news reports. And the Biden administration appears to have been surprised by the speed of the Taliban’s progress.Biden has defended his decision and ruled out any changes in the pullout plan. “Afghan leaders have to come together,” he said on Tuesday. “They’ve got to fight for themselves, fight for their nation.”He added: “I do not regret my decision.”The Taliban’s military advances have caused international concern and the UN Security Council (UNSC) has condemned the violence and reaffirmed its opposition to the restoration of the Islamic emirate.India, which has the rotational presidency of the UNSC for August, told the body at a briefing on Afghanistan last Friday that “(it’s) time for the international community and, in particular, this council to take stock of the situation, and decide on actions that would help bring a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire and ensure an immediate cessation of violence”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-slams-biden-calls-for-conditions-based-afghan-exit-101628781946913.html
12-08-2021||World||US conducts impact trial test on nuclear carrier, sends message to China: Report||The US Navy’s aircraft carrier Gerald R Ford successfully withstood an impact trial test when 20 tonnes of explosives were detonated underwater, news agency PTI reported citing American Navy officials. Military observers told the news agency that the successful test indicates that the threat posed by Chinese ‘carrier killer’ missiles have been effectively reduced.The final trial was conducted in Florida on Sunday. Earlier full ship shock trials were conducted on the US’ most advanced nuclear carrier on June 18 and July 16. During the shock trial testing 40,000 pounds of ordnance is detonated in the water near the hull to test the ship as well as its system. Success in the test will indicate no major injuries, no fires and no flooding. The amount of ordnance used is equivalent to a 3.9-magnitude earthquake.“We had zero catastrophic failures on the ship, zero situations where we had flooding or anything, and zero fires. All that is pretty significant,” Capt. Paul Lanzilotta, Ford’s commanding officer was quoted as saying in the press release.China watched the developments very keenly as the Chinese military continues to flaunt its DF-21D and DF-26 missiles, which it calls ‘carrier killers’. China’s carrier killers can hit moving aircraft carriers from a distance of 5,000 kilometres.Former Chinese military instructor Song Zhongping told the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post that the 40,000lbs explosive blast was bigger ‘than any single warhead of a conventional missile or torpedo’. He also said that the reason for conducting the trial is also to send a message to China and Russia that US aircraft carriers have ‘super-resilience’. “They want to send a message to China and Russia… They are not worried about Chinese or Russian conventional anti-ship weapons,” Zhongping was quoted as saying by the SCMP.Zhongping however said that some ballistic and hypersonic missiles have the capability of taking these carriers fully out of combat as they may also carry electromagnetic pulse weapons that are detonated at high altitude.China’s DF-26, according to military experts, can conduct accurate nuclear or conventional strikes against ground and naval targets.US plans to maintain a stronger fleetIn July, the Chinese president Xi Jinping asked the People’s Liberation Army to ‘ make resolute efforts to transform China’s army into the world’s best army by 2027 on par with the US army’. The Chinese navy continues to strengthen its fleet and has more ships than the US. Chinese navy has 360 ships and the US Navy 297, as of 2020. The US, however, has larger ships with 11 aircraft carriers to China’s two. The US also has 92 cruisers and destroyers compared to PLA’s 33, according to a report by news agency SCMP. The US government in June made it clear that it plans to maintain a fleet of between 321 and 372 manned ships.The US Navy’s moves come amid the US trying to challenge the Chinese supremacy in the disputed South China Sea. The test sends a message that its focus on maintaining its supremacy is its primary objective as China’s navy continues its shipbuilding spree.China’s anti-ship ballistic missiles DF-21D and DF-26, also known as the ‘aircraft carrier killer’ missiles, simultaneously hit targets which were moving thousands of kilometres in a test in the South China Sea in 2020, according to the SCMP. Russia is also testing Zircon -- a hypersonic anti-ship cruise missile - which has the ability to reach a maximum speed of Mach 9.(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-conducts-impact-trial-test-on-nuclear-carrier-sends-message-to-china-report-101628781378225.html

Appearing for NBC’s ‘Today’ show, Fauci revealed that booster shots will be recommended “imminently” for fully vaccinated people with weakened immune systems.While the 80-year-old immunologist said the United States is not going to administer booster shots in coming days to people other than those who are immuno-compromised, he acknowledged that “inevitably there will be a time when we'll have to get boosts” since “no vaccine, at least not within this category, is going to have an indefinite amount of protection.”Fauci, the chief medical advisor to US President Joe Biden, said researchers are collecting data to determine when the protection for other vaccinated groups, like the elderly, will go below a “critical level”.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will have to amend emergency use authorisation for Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to approve booster shots for immuno-compromised people.Also Read | Anthony Fauci says Covid boosters should go ‘soon’ to the vulnerableEarlier this month, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for a moratorium on booster shots until at least the end of September to enable all countries to vaccinate at least 10% of their population.

But we cannot accept countries that have already used most of the global supply of vaccines using even more of it, while the Earth globe Europe-Africa's most vulnerable people remain unprotected," the WHO chief said.However, the call has largely gone unheeded with most of the high-income countries as they have moved ahead with their booster shots plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-vaccine-to-provide-protection-indefinitely-everyone-will-need-booster-shots-fauci-101628778851188.html

12-08-2021||World||Covid-19: Ningbo-Zhoushan, world's third-busiest port partly shut down by China||China partly shut the world’s third-busiest container port after a worker became infected with Covid, threatening more damage to already fragile supply chains and global trade as a key shopping season nears.All inbound and outbound container services at Meishan terminal in Ningbo-Zhoushan port were halted Wednesday until further notice due to a “system disruption,” according to a statement from the port. An employee tested positive for coronavirus, the eastern Chinese city’s government said.The closed terminal accounts for about 25% of container cargo through the port, calculates security consultant GardaWorld, which said “the suspension could severely impact cargo handling and shipping.” Germany’s Hapag-Lloyd AG said there will be a delay in sailings.This is the second recent shutdown of a Chinese port due to the coronavirus, after the closure of Yantian port in Shenzhen from late May for about a month. That shutdown caused goods to back up in factories and storage yards and also likely contributed to soaring freight rates, which are at record levels. The fear is that this new disruption will further strain international shipping and supplies of goods, already hurt by the pandemic’s squeeze on manufacturers. An extended shuttering at Ningbo could be especially damaging for the world economy because seaborne trade usually rises toward the end of the year as companies ship Christmas and holiday products.“There may be far-reaching downstream consequences going into Black Friday and holiday shopping seasons” and the next 24 hours will determine whether there is a large outbreak or not, said Josh Brazil, vice president of marketing at project44, a supply-chain intelligence firm. “One of the few givens in 2021 is endemic delays, and the fact that conditions can change almost overnight.”In addition to the closed terminal, containers for shipment through the other terminals in the port will likely slow. The port will now only accept containers within two days of a ship’s estimated arrival time, according to a statement from shipping and logistics firm CMA CGM SA.The biggest exports through Ningbo in the first half of this year were electronic goods, textiles and low and high-end manufactured goods, according to the city’s Customs Bureau. Top imports included crude oil, electronics, raw chemicals and agricultural products. Speaking about the outbreak, Hugo De Stoop, CEO of oil shipper Euronav NV said “there will be an impact on China’s oil demand, but the length of the impact is unclear.” For port outbreaks “the Chinese authorities are very very strict. When they find a case they will be very quick to shutdown, isolate the workers, isolate the coworkers who have had contact with that specific worker and then reopen as quickly as possible,” he told Bloomberg Television Thursday, adding that this strictness in dealing with outbreaks can disrupt markets. All the close contacts of the infected worker have been identified and are in quarantine, according to Ningbo City’s statement. A port spokesman who declined to give his name said there was no new information when contacted Thursday.The port was the third busiest globally in terms of container shipments in 2020 and the second busiest in China after Shanghai, according to maritime publication Lloyd’s List.The discovery of the port worker that tested positive for Covid-19 shows that virus-prevention measures in Ningbo City still has loopholes, the local government said in a statement on its website Thursday, which urged officials to implement quarantines, disinfection and close affected areas to prevent the virus’ spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-ningbo-zhoushan-world-s-third-busiest-port-partly-shut-down-by-china-101628771431112.html

As the Taliban offensive is increasing, there are campaigns to shift its blame on Pakistan," Pakistan National Security Adviser Moeed Yusuf told a press conference on Wednesday.Thousands of civilians have been displaced due to the Taliban’s offensive and many of them have taken refuge in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital city. According to a UN estimate, more than 3 lakh Afghans have been displaced internally while around 40,000 people have been fleeing to neighbouring Iran every week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stop-proxy-war-afghan-diaspora-to-protest-in-front-of-pak-embassy-in-us-101628771298996.html
12-08-2021||World||Afghan govt offers Taliban power-sharing deal in Qatar to end violence: Report||The negotiators representing the Afghan government in Qatar have offered the Taliban a power-sharing deal in an attempt to end the violence in the war-torn region, reported news agency AFP. The Taliban has been reluctant to strike a political settlement with the Afghan government and other regional stakeholders since the US-led troops finalised their withdrawal from the region."Yes, the government has submitted a proposal to Qatar as mediator. The proposal allows the Taliban to share power in return for a halt in violence in the country," AFP quoted a government negotiator as saying.The Taliban fighters have intensified their offensive against Afghan security forces as they make rapid gains in the region. The Islamist fundamentalist group has taken control of 10 provincial capital so far and the US has reportedly expressed concerns that Kabul may fall to militants within three months.The deteriorating situation has prompted India to advise its nationals in Afghanistan to make immediate arrangements to leave the country. A special flight was flown from Mazar-e-Sharif to New Delhi carrying India-based officials and security personnel from the Indian consulate and a small number of Indian nationals living in and around Afghanistan’s fourth-largest city."We're closely monitoring developments, we're concerned about deteriorating security situation. Our Mission in Kabul issued advisory for Indian nationals earlier this week, advising them to return to India via commercial flights," Arindam Bagchi, spokesperson for the ministry of external affairs, said on Thursday.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aghan-govt-offers-taliban-power-sharing-deal-in-qatar-to-end-violence-report-101628767223965.html
12-08-2021||World||China to bring in sweeping new laws on governance||The Chinese government has said it will make new laws on national security, monopolies, education, and culture, signalling that an ongoing crackdown on various industrial sectors will continue.The ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council, or China’s Cabinet, publicised the plans late on Wednesday as part of a five-year plan for “building a law-based government”.President Xi Jinping, perceived as China’s most powerful ruler since Mao Zedong, has made “rule of law” one of his several signature aspects of his governance style, which will be extended if - as expected - he seeks a third term next year.The CPC and the government said in a blueprint for the five years to 2025 that they would also improve legislation around public health by amending the infectious disease law and the “frontier health and quarantine law”.It is rare for the CPC and the government - though the latter is an extension of the former - to jointly issue a document, published by the Xinhua news agency.“It (the new document) urges improving government functions in various fields, including economic adjustment, market supervision, social management, public service, and environmental protection,” Xinhua reported on the 10-point plan.In the document, China’s top leadership urged “…governments at all levels to promote law-based administration with the help of digital technologies, including the internet, big data, and artificial intelligence”.On improving the law-based business environment, the plan calls for concrete efforts to prevent the administrative power from eliminating or stifling competition.“It also promises strengthened enforcement of anti-monopoly and anti-unfair competition laws.”“It stresses pushing forward legislative activities and studies in key areas such as national security, bio-security, infectious diseases prevention and control, and digital economy.”The unveiling of the document seems to be part of Beijing’s ongoing crackdown on technology companies and the private education systemEarlier this year, Beijing launched anti-monopoly investigations into some of the country’s biggest technology firms; tech giant Alibaba accepted a record $2.8 billion fine after an investigation found that it had abused its dominant market position for years.In July, another tech behemoth Tencent had to end exclusive music licensing deals with record labels around the world - also charged with monopolistic practices.The government has sharpened scrutiny of after-school tuition services offered by individual teachers, raiding such places.A Reuters report said that shares in many Chinese companies listed in the US, Hong Kong and mainland China have fallen sharply this year as investors’ concerns grow over the crackdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-bring-in-sweeping-new-laws-on-governance-101628766154264.html

The highly contagious Delta variant of coronavirus has become the dominant strain across the globe as many countries are reimposing restrictions to contain the virus.In its weekly epidemiological report, the UN health agency said that the US, India, Iran, Brazil, and Indonesia reported the most number of Covid-19 cases. While India, Brazil and Indonesia witnessed a decline in infections from the previous week, the United States and Iran reported a huge spike with 734,354 and 248,102 new Covid-19 cases respectively.The regions reporting the highest weekly infections and related deaths per capita remained the same as the previous week. While the Regions of the Americas and Europe reported the highest weekly incidence in cases, the Regions of the Americas, Europe and South-East Asia reported the highest weekly incidence of deaths.Also Read | Covid-19 may become a mostly childhood disease in few years: StudyThe Delta variant was reported from seven additional countries last week, taking the total number of countries reporting the variant of concern to 142, as per the WHO report.

12-08-2021||World||Britain's economy saw faster growth in June as lockdown rules eased: Data||The United Kingdom's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an entire percentage point, which is 0.8 per cent more than what was predicted by economists, in June when the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-necessitated lockdown was eased. The information was provided on Thursday by Britain's office for national statistics noting that the economic growth for the country is now at 4.8 per cent for the second quarter, which is close to the 5 per cent prediction made by the Bank of England last week.The latest statistics imply that the UK economy is only 2.2 per cent smaller than before the series of Covid-19 lockdowns and related regulations came into effect. This, in turn, implies a sharp recovery from the worst recession that the country faced in three centuries. The Bank of England expects the lost output to return by the end of this year.“Today’s figures show that our economy is on the mend, showing strong signs of recovery,” news agency Bloomberg quoted the chancellor of the exchequer Rishi Sunak as saying. “I know there are still challenges to overcome, but I feel confident in the strength of the UK economy.”What's behind UK's economic growth in June?According to statisticians quoted by the news agency, UK's health services and a resurgence in hospitality were the key driving factors behind the economic growth in June. Along with these sectors, education also surged during the quarter when schools reopened after the lockdowns rules were used.Since UK residents made frequent visits to general physicians, the health and social work sector became the largest contributor to the June growth, said Hande Kucuk, the deputy director of the National Institute of Economic & Social Research. “We expect growth to slow in the third quarter but still remain high by historical standards,” he said.Another reason behind the strong economic recovery is the massive financial support provided by the government, for example by paying the bulk of private-sector wages.Economic rebound faces challengeHowever, total UK output remains 4.4 per cent lower compared with before the Covid-19 pandemic, or the final quarter of 2019. The GDP fell by 1.6 per cent in the first three months of the year, the office for national statistics noted, indicating that the economic rebound has plenty of challenges up ahead.The jobs protection programme sponsored by the government is set to end this September, while global supply chain bottlenecks still persist. Analysts also warn that strong price rises could force central banks to hike interest rates sooner than expected, hindering the recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britains-economy-saw-faster-growth-in-june-as-lockdown-rules-eased-data-101628755515777.html
12-08-2021||World||Afghanistan replaces army chief as Taliban continues to advance||The Afghan army chief has been replaced amid Taliban offensive, reports said, as the Taliban continued to make rapid advances across Afghanistan capturing key cities. General Wali Mohammad Ahmadzai was on Wednesday replaced by Hibatullah Alizai, the commander of the Special Operations Corps, multiple reports including from local media said on Wednesday. "General Hibatullah Alizai, the commander of the Special Operations Corps, was appointed as the chief of army staff, replacing General Wali Ahmadzai, officials confirmed," a tweet by TOLO News read.As of Thursday morning, the Taliban insurgents have taken control of 10 provincial capitals in the northern region as the US is withdrawing its army troops from the country. Ghazni, which is just 150 kilometres away from the country's capital of Kabul, became the latest city to be captured by the Taliban.The sacking of the army chief followed a visit by the country's President Ashraf Ghani in Mazar-e-Sharif in the Balkh province, which fall into Taliban control on Wednesday.Since May, when the US and Nato forces started withdrawing from the country, the Taliban began an assault on major cities and seized control of cities Sar-e-Pol, Sheberghan, Aybak, Kunduz, Taluqan, Pul-e-Khumri, Farah, Zaranj and Faizabad.As the conflict continues to spiral, the Taliban have also been attacking civilians. UN high commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet on Tuesday said at least 180 people have been killed while more than 1,180 have been wounded in four Afghan cities alone since July 9. Many members of Afghan security forces have also been killed and wounded in the violence.With the Afghan air power limited and in disarray, the US air force is believed to be carrying out some series of strikes to support Afghan forces. Aviation tracking data suggested US Air Force B-52 bombers, F-15 fighter jets, drones and other aircraft were involved in the fighting overnight across the country, news agency AP reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-replaces-army-chief-as-taliban-continues-to-advance-101628756665815.html
12-08-2021||World||Taliban seizes key Afghan city of Ghazni, US worried Kabul could fall in 90 days||The Taliban in Afghanistan have now taken control of the key city of Ghazni, which lies just 150 kilometres away from the country's capital and seat of power Kabul, reported the AFP news agency on Thursday morning, citing a senior lawmaker and the insurgents. This makes Ghazni the tenth provincial capital to fall to the Taliban this week, amid a rapidly deteriorating political situation which reportedly has the United States worried that Kabul may fall to the insurgents in 90 days."The Taliban took control of the key areas of the city -- the governor's office, the police headquarters, and the prison," AFP quoted Nasir Ahmad Faqiri, head of the provincial council of Ghazni, as saying. Although clashes are being reported from parts of the city, the provincial capital lies largely under the control of the insurgents at this point, he said.The news agency also reached out to the Taliban to verify the development. A statement posted by the insurgency's spokesperson on social media confirmed the fact that Ghazni has indeed fallen to the Taliban.Ghazni is situated along the major Kabul-Kandahar highway, essentially serving as an important gateway in Afghanistan between the capital city of Kabul and other Taliban strongholds in the south.It is likely that the fall of Ghazni will put more pressure on the Afghan airforce, which is already having a hard time dealing with the Taliban as the insurgents continue seizing provincial capitals around the country. In less than a week, as many as 10 such cities have fallen, with the Taliban strategically encircling the biggest city in the north, the traditional anti-Taliban bastion of Mazar-i-Sharif.According to Reuters, a US defence official cited the country's intelligence sources late on Wednesday and estimated that the Taliban could isolate Kabul in about a month. Considering their recent rapid gains, the militants could also seize control of the Afghan capital within 90 days, the official was quoted as saying by the news agency.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-seizes-key-afghan-city-of-ghazni-us-worried-kabul-could-fall-in-90-days-101628748334077.html

Sami Sadat, the 36-year-old commander of the country's special forces, has been fighting the Taliban and keeping it out in Lashkar Gah, the capital of the southern province of Helmand.The Afghan government on Wednesday promoted Sadat as the commanding general of the Afghan National Army commandos. He was leading the 215 Maiwand Afghan Army Corps before this. Sadat has been tweeting photos and videos of the army's offensive and the atrocities committed by the Taliban even as hundreds of soldiers have reportedly surrendered across Afghanistan.Sadat has 12,400 followers on Twitter and they include government officials to journalists. He told AFP in a phone interview from Lashkar Gah that they are going to win the war despite the Taliban's brutal advances.'Anything but naive'"I know this is our country, that the Taliban are failing, that they will fail sooner or later," he told AFP.

The document may be released this fall.A release from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada said the government “recognises” that proof of vaccination credentials will support the “re-opening of societies and economies” and that Canadians were looking for a “more reliable and secure way to demonstrate their Covid-19 vaccination history to foreign and Canadian border officials”.In that context, it noted that Ottawa is “collaborating with the provinces and territories to develop a proof of vaccination that will facilitate cross-border travel, while reducing the risk of spread and importation of Covid-19.”It also said the attempt was to take “a secure pan-Canadian approach” based on advice from the country’s public health officials.With the country gradually and cautiously reopening, Canada’s minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship Marco Mendicino said “many Canadians are contemplating doing something they haven’t done in over a year and a half: travelling. Our work with the provinces and territories to provide a consistent proof of vaccination is a key step forward in ensuring Canadians will have the documents they need once it is safe to travel again”.While the focus is on a digital proof of vaccination, the passports will also accessible to those unable to avail of them in that form. The passports, the release said, will provide foreign border officials with the traveller’s vaccination history while also providing a “trusted and verifiable credential for when they return home”.Canada is participating in an international dialogue on such passports, including with the World Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization, and through the G7. The statement said while currently there is “no international consensus on an acceptable proof of vaccination”, Ottawa was “working with international partners to recognise proof of vaccination credentials issued in Canada.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-to-issue-vaccine-passports-for-international-travel-101628745813474.html

According to the country's disaster management minister Ghulam Bahauddin Jilani, more than 60,000 families in Afghanistan's 34 provinces have been displaced by the escalation of the war in the last two months. At least 17,000 of them have taken refuge in national capital Kabul, which is also being threatened by the Sunni Pashtun fighters.The stunning speed at which the Taliban are capturing large swathes of land in Afghanistan raises questions of how long the Afghan government can maintain control of the parts the country it has left.Watch: Taliban seize Mi-35 attack helicopter gifted by India from KunduzThe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) warned on Tuesday that the failure to stem the rising violence and human rights violations and abuses is having disastrous consequences for the people of Afghanistan.Various local news reports say that killings of women and children have risen almost 50 per cent since the Taliban intensified their fight to capture Afghanistan in the wake of withdrawal of US and Nato forces. The reports said that at least 468 children have been killed this year.One of the most criticised moves by the Taliban is a decree saying their fighters can take girls as young as 13 or 14, if they have been widowed in fight with the security forces.

Crews had contained only 30 percent of the blaze as of Wednesday evening.Temperatures were expected to cross over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius) in coming days as a high pressure weather system, described by forecasters as a "heat dome" bakes the Pacific Northwest."High pressure continues to build over the incident and will be the dominant feature with predicted thunderstorms moving in this week," the California Department of Forestry and Fire protection said in an incident update.The thunderstorms can rake the landscape with so-called dry lightning, igniting more flames across Northern California in forests and brush left brown and parched from years of drought.The Dixie Fire has scorched more than 500,000 acres, making it by far the largest and most destructive of 11 wildfires burning across California, fought by nearly 10,000 personnel. Two firefighters and a civilian have been injured.The blaze has now destroyed more than 1,000 single-family homes, along with hundreds of other structures. Flames roared through the historic mining town of Greenville last week, leaving its main street in smoldering ruins.California, which typically experiences peak fire season later in the year, is on pace to suffer more burnt acres this year than last, the worst fire season on record.The state's five largest wildfires in history have all occurred in the last three years, burning more than 2.5 million acres and destroying 3,700 structures.The Dixie Fire is second in size only to last year's August Complex, which was comprised of several smaller fires that merged together to make one massive conflagration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-wildfire-wreaks-more-destruction-as-temperatures-rise-101628737615957.html
12-08-2021||World||Sydney delta cases rise as Australian capital Canberra faces lockdown||Australia’s capital Canberra will enter a snap seven-day lockdown on Thursday after detecting one Covid-19 case, as the delta outbreak that’s roiling Sydney spreads to regional areas of the nation.Canberra and the surrounding Australian Capital Territory will start its lockdown from 5pm. Thursday, local health authorities said in an emailed statement. The national capital’s case was the first recorded there outside of the hotel-quarantine system in more than a year; it is currently unknown how the person was infected.“This is by far the most serious public health risk the ACT has faced in the past 12 months,” the territory’s Chief Minister Andrew Barr said in the statement. “We have seen that a short and immediate lockdown limits the potential spread of the virus, and is the best path to avoiding longer and more damaging lockdowns.”It will be Canberra’s first lockdown for more than a year, since the first wave of the pandemic. The inland city of about 500,000 people is some 170 miles from Sydney, which has been in lockdown for almost seven weeks; Melbourne is also currently enforcing stay-at-home orders.New South Wales, Australia’s biggest state economy, recorded 345 new cases Thursday, the vast bulk in Sydney. Daily case numbers have generally been on a steady incline since the outbreak started in Australia’s largest city in mid-June.Two more people in Sydney have died. Both were men in their 90s and had received at least one vaccine dose.Three more local government areas of Sydney will face tighter social-distancing and movement restrictions, while the lockdown in the Hunter Valley region of the state -- including the city of Newcastle -- will be extended for at least another week, New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters on Thursday.With the nation’s capital and two largest cities in lockdown, as well as an increasing number of regional areas, the delta variant of the coronavirus is placing increased pressure on Australia’s so-called “Covid Zero” strategy, which has relied on closed international borders and rigorous testing to eliminate community transmission of the virus.Prime Minister Scott Morrison is aiming to ramp up a tardy vaccine rollout in a bid to start reopening international borders next year, that have only been tightened over the course of the past year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sydney-delta-cases-rise-as-australian-capital-canberra-faces-lockdown-101628736159273.html
12-08-2021||World||Delta-free haven New Zealand sets out path to opening borders||New Zealand laid out a plan for easing some of the world’s toughest border curbs, which have kept out the highly contagious delta variant and seen the island nation effectively Covid-free for much of the pandemic.The government will speed up its vaccine rollout this year and begin a phased reopening of the border in early 2022, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Thursday in Wellington. Vaccinated travelers from low-risk countries will eventually be able to enter New Zealand without going into quarantine, she said.“Getting vaccinated is the number one thing everyone can do to be protected against Covid-19, help accelerate our economic recovery, reduce the risk of lockdowns, and safely allow New Zealand’s borders to begin re-opening next year,” Ardern said. “The first step in our plan is speeding up the vaccination process to ensure everyone is at least partially vaccinated as soon as possible to reduce the risk and impact of delta entering the country.”Since the outset of the pandemic over a year ago, New Zealand’s border has been closed to foreigners and all returning residents have been required to enter a managed isolation facility for two weeks. The system has caught imported cases, but there have been no delta infections in the community so far. A quarantine-free travel bubble with neighbor Australia was suspended last month due to delta-driven outbreaks there.New Zealand’s push to eliminate the virus has paid dividends, with just 26 Covid deaths and life within its borders relatively normal. The country has scored consistently well on Bloomberg’s Covid Resilience Ranking, which measures the best and worst places to be amid the pandemic. After some early lockdowns, community transmission has been scarce thanks to the nation’s isolation and the zero-tolerance border and testing regime.But a slow vaccination rollout -- just 23% of the population is covered, versus more than 50% in the U.S. -- has left it vulnerable to an outbreak of the delta strain, which has forced large parts of Australia back into lockdown. At the same time, Ardern has been under pressure to present a road map out of “fortress New Zealand,” with the restrictions decimating its tourism industry and leading to shortages of migrant labor.Vaccination RolloutArdern said the government will make the Pfizer Inc. vaccine available to all adults sooner than previously planned and increase the gap between doses to six weeks from three. This will allow more New Zealanders to get their first dose sooner and ensure as many as possible are at least partially vaccinated in coming months, she said.From Sept. 1, all eligible ages will be able to book a vaccination appointment.The government will also use the second half of 2021 to conduct a self-isolation trial for vaccinated New Zealanders in preparation for the gradual resumption of quarantine-free travel. From the first quarter of 2022, new risk-based border settings will be introduced that establish low, medium and high-risk pathways into the country.The pathway a traveler takes will be based on the risk associated with where they are coming from and their vaccination status, and each pathway will have testing and isolation requirements proportionate to that risk.A low-risk pathway will permit quarantine-free entry for vaccinated travelers; a medium-risk pathway would include a combination of self-isolation and/or reduced managed isolation for vaccinated travelers, while a high-risk pathway will require a full 14 days in quarantine and testing regardless of vaccination status.“This individual risk-based approach requires new systems to be set up,” Ardern said. “We will use the remainder of 2021 to continue to prepare for the operation of borders under this system.”The government is investigating methods to rapidly test airport arrivals for Covid, she said.Covid ZeroNew Zealand joins other so-called Covid Zero economies -- places that have targeted suppression of the virus within their borders -- in laying out a framework for exiting the strategy. While effective in eliminating the virus, the approach relies on continued isolation, which nations with significant tourism sectors like New Zealand can’t afford long term.‘Covid Zero’ Havens Find Reopening Harder Than Taming VirusSingapore, which has also gone spells Covid-free and tightly polices its borders, says it will start to ease curbs once it hits 80% of the population vaccinated, while Australia has indicated a rough timetable to open up in the first quarter of 2022, a plan that may be complicated by the current resurgence.Meanwhile, China, the biggest adherent of Covid Zero, is doubling down on the strategy after delta got past its defenses and seeds flareups there. The country is not expected to start opening up until mid-to-late next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deltafree-haven-new-zealand-sets-out-path-to-opening-borders-101628735011401.html
12-08-2021||World||US Prez Joe Biden says pull-out is on despite Taliban’s march||US President Joe Biden has ruled out any change in the American plan to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan despite the Taliban group increasingly gaining control over large parts of the war-torn country, saying Afghan leaders need to fight for themselves and their nation.Biden in April ordered the withdrawal of all the US troops from Afghanistan by September 11 to end America’s longest war. The Pentagon’s task of removing service members and equipment out of the country is nearly complete and the US military mission is slated to end by August 31.“No,” Biden told reporters on Tuesday at the White House when asked if his plan to withdraw troops could change at all, given Taliban’s lightning offensive in the north.“Look, we spent over a trillion dollars over 20 years. We trained and equipped over 300,000 Afghan forces. Afghan leaders have to come together. We lost thousands - lost to death and injury - thousands of American personnel. They’ve got to fight for themselves, fight for their nation,” he said.“I’ll insist we continue to keep the commitments we made of providing close air support, making sure that their air force functions and is operable, resupplying their forces with food and equipment, and paying all their salaries. But they’ve got to want to fight,” Biden said.Earlier on Wednesday, the Taliban captured the city of Faizabad in northern Afghanistan, a local MP told AFP, making it the ninth provincial capital to fall to the rampaging insurgents in less than a week.Afghanistan’s President Ashraf Ghani flew to the besieged northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif on Wednesday to rally the beleaguered government forces. But while Ghani is focusing on motivating his troops in Mazar-i-Sharif, US intelligence said the Taliban could isolate the capital city of Kabul in 30 days and potentially take it over in 90 days.Army chief replacedGhani has ordered Hibatullah Alizai to replace Wali Ahmadzai as the Afghan army chief of staff, according to an Afghan official who spoke to AP. Alizai was the commander of the Afghan army’s Special Operations Corps - the elite troops that, along with the air force, have been forced to do most of the fighting as regular forces have collapsed.Finance minister quitsAfghanistan’s acting finance minister Khalid Payenda has resigned and left the country for the US after the Taliban captured key customs posts bleeding the administration of revenue. Payenda has “resigned and left the country because Afghanistan is grappling with declining revenues”, finance ministry spokesman Mohammad Rafi Tabe said.Taliban seize helicopter gifted by India: ReportA video on social media suggests that a helicopter was seized by the Taliban at the Kunduz airbase, according to an ANI report. The chopper that was reportedly seized from Afghan forces may possibly have been one that was gifted by India to Afghanistan a few years ago as part of the capability building of the war-torn country. There was no confirmation of the development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-joe-biden-says-pull-out-is-on-despite-taliban-s-march-101628731959918.html

Protesters had defied a ban on public gatherings. The slow roll-out of vaccines as well as financial hardship from restrictions are fuelling public anger towards Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha’s government.China approves first mixed vaccine trialsChina’s drug regulator has approved the country’s first mixed-vaccine trials as the rapid spread of the Delta variant raises concern about the efficacy of locally produced jabs. The trial will test the efficacy of combining an “inactivated” vaccine made by China’s Sinovac with a DNA-based one developed by US pharma company Inovio.Quebec to implement Covid vaccine passportsThe Canadian province of Quebec will start recognising Covid-19 vaccine passports or passes from September 1, which will limit the public’s access to certain facilities such as restaurants and gyms.
