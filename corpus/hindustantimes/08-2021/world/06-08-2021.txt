It needs to be ensured that Afghanistan’s neighbours and the region are not threatened by terrorism, separatism and extremism.”He called for “zero tolerance” for all forms of terrorism, and said it is equally important to ensure Afghan soil isn’t used by terror groups to threaten or attack any other country. “Those providing material and financial support to terrorist entities must be held accountable,” he added.The world community should “decide on actions that would help bring a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire”, and ensure the Taliban “engage in negotiations in good faith, eschew the path of violence, severe ties with al-Qaeda and other terrorist organisations, and fully commit itself towards reaching a political solution”, Tirumurti added.He also reiterated New Delhi’s support for an inclusive Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled peace process that leads to a political settlement that protects the gains of the past two decades and preserves the rights of women, children and minorities.The Afghan envoy to the UN, Ghulam M Isaczai, was more scathing in his criticism of Pakistan’s role in backing the Taliban, which he said, was being assisted in acts of barbarism by “foreign fighters from trans-national terrorist networks”.The Taliban have launched more than 5,500 attacks since mid-April with support from more than 10,000 foreign fighters representing 20 groups, including al-Qaeda, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) and Islamic State.“Importantly, the Taliban continue to enjoy a safe haven in and supply and logistics line extended to their war machine from Pakistan. Graphic reports and video of Taliban fighters congregating close to the Durand Line to enter Afghanistan, fund-raising events, transfer of dead bodies for mass burial and treatment of injured Taliban in Pakistani hospitals are emerging and are widely available,” Isaczai said.“Consistent with the agreement of the leadership of Afghanistan and Pakistan in Tashkent last month, we urge Pakistan to help with removing and dismantling of Taliban sanctuaries and supply lines and establish with us a joint monitoring and verification mechanism to make the fight against terrorism and international efforts for peace effective and credible,” he added.Barbara Woodward, the UK envoy to the UN, said the Taliban must realise there will be consequences if it continues its military offensive. “There can be no military solution to this conflict. For our part, the UK will not recognise a Taliban government that comes to power by force,” she said.The US representative condemned the increase in violent attacks and said: “The Taliban must hear from the international community that we will not accept a military takeover of Afghanistan or a return of the Taliban’s Islamic emirate. The Taliban will be isolated and an international pariah if they choose that path, which would most certainly push the country to further violence and destruction.”The US representative listed five principles for a negotiated and inclusive solution, including inclusive governance, the right of the Afghan people to elect political leaders, protection of human rights, a commitment to counter-terrorism and no safe havens for foreign terrorists, and adherence to international and humanitarian laws.Special representative Deborah Lyons asked the Security Council to issue an unambiguous statement calling for cessation of attacks on cities, and countries in contact with the Taliban’s political commission should insist on a ceasefire and a resumption of negotiations. The exemptions to the UN travel ban on Taliban leaders is for the sole purpose of peace negotiations, and further extension during a review on September 20 “must be predicated on real progress in peace”, she said.Following the statements by the 15 members of the Security Council, the meeting was adjourned for consultations behind closed doors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dangerous-turning-point-taliban-hammered-at-unsc-meet-on-afghanistan-101628272500408.html

The family stopped to enjoy the scenic beauty of the area when their car started to begin towards the edge of the cliff, according to a report by news agency Daily Mail.The car was parked at a popular tourist spot overlooking a valley. The video posted by news agency Daily Mail shows that the driver stepped out of the car to take a sip of his drink when the vehicle started moving forward. As the driver tried to stop the car from rolling down the cliff an older woman and a young boy managed to get out of the back seat. According to another report by news agency the Sun, a woman in the front seat was unable to exit the vehicle and was stuck inside the car as it plunged off the cliff.The Hejing County Emergency Management Bureau later said that the woman who was trapped inside the car managed to survive the plunge with hip injuries. The reason as to why the car started moving in the first place is still unclear.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/car-plunges-off-cliff-family-manages-to-get-out-in-nick-of-time-1-injured-101628270269902.html
06-08-2021||World||Afghan war has entered 'deadlier, more destructive phase', UN says||The UN special envoy for Afghanistan on Friday questioned the Taliban's commitment to a political settlement, telling the UN Security Council the war has entered a "deadlier and more destructive phase" with more than 1,000 civilians killed in the past month during a Taliban offensive."A party that was genuinely committed to a negotiated settlement would not risk so many civilian casualties, because it would understand that the process of reconciliation will be more challenging, the more blood is shed," Deborah Lyons said.The Taliban have stepped up their campaign to defeat the US-backed government since April as foreign forces complete their withdrawal after 20 years of war. The Taliban captured an Afghan provincial capital and assassinated the government's top media officer in Kabul on Friday."This is now a different kind of war, reminiscent of Syria, recently, or Sarajevo, in the not-so-distant past," Lyons said."To attack urban areas is to knowingly inflict enormous harm and cause massive civilian casualties. Nonetheless, the threatening of large urban areas appears to be a strategic decision by the Taliban, who have accepted the likely carnage that will ensue," she said.Peace talks between the Afghan government and Taliban negotiators started last year in the Qatari capital of Doha, but have not made any substantive progress.Russia's UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the council that the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan was of increasing concern and "with the withdrawal of foreign forces, the outlook looks grim."It is clear that there is no military solution to the Afghan situation, but in the current situation - given the absence of progress on the negotiation track - the prospects of Afghanistan slipping into full scale and protracted civil war, unfortunately, is a stark reality," he said.Senior US diplomat Jeffrey DeLaurentis urged the Taliban to halt their offensive, pursue a political settlement and protect Afghanistan's infrastructure and people."The Taliban must hear from the international community that we will not accept a military takeover of Afghanistan or a return of the Taliban's Islamic Emirate," he said.Afghanistan's UN Ambassador Ghulam Isaczai urged the Security Council to act to "prevent a catastrophic situation.""We're alarmed by reports and incidents of gross human rights violation by the Taliban and their foreign terrorist associates in almost half of our country and we are extremely concerned about the safety and security of people in cities under Taliban attacks," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-war-has-entered-deadlier-more-destructive-phase-un-says-101628267800255.html
06-08-2021||World||Time for ‘actions’, India tells UNSC on Afghanistan||India told the UN Security Council (UNSC) on Friday the time has come for it to “decide on actions” to bring a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire and ensure an immediate cessation of violence in Afghanistan, which, it warned, posed a “serious threat” to regional peace and security.Participating in a UNSC briefing on Afghanistan, India also told the council that for the sake of enduring peace in Afghanistan all “terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries in the region must be dismantled immediately”. This is usually a pointer to Pakistan’s continued support of terrorism and terrorists.This was the first discussion on Afghanistan on India’s watch as the rotational president of the Security Council for August, and came just a few days after the body strongly condemned escalating violence perpetrated by the resurgent Taliban and reiterated its opposition to restoration of the “Islamic Emirate”, as the 1996-2001 Taliban-ruled country was called.Deborah Lyons, the special representative of the secretary-general for Afghanistan and head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), briefed the members on the security situation in the country, whose new Permanent Representative, Ghulam M Isaczai, also participated in the briefing, which was followed by a closed-door consultation of the body.Citing recent escalation in violence including an attack on the UN compound in Herat, TS Tirumurti, the Indian permanent representative to the UN, said, “It is, therefore, time for the international community and, in particular, this council to take stock of the situation, and decide on actions that would help bring a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire and ensure an immediate cessation of violence.”He added: “Anything short of this will constitute a serious threat to regional peace and security.”The permanent representative reiterated India’s support for negotiations as the only way forward, but for it to be successful, he said, “it is necessary to ensure that the Taliban engage in negotiations in good faith, eschew the path of violence, severe ties with the al-Qaeda and other terrorist organisations, and fully commit itself towards reaching a political solution”.Talks, meanwhile, have stalled. The Taliban have moved swiftly, instead, in recent weeks to expand their military influence in Afghanistan as US-led international forces pull out of the country according to a timetable announced by President Joe Biden. The Taliban have “captured more territory in the last two months than during any other period since the US invasion in 2001”, the UNSC said in a scene-setter note for the Friday meeting. It added that the Taliban now control more than half of the districts in Afghanistan.It further noted that the Taliban’s territorial gains have been “accompanied by a dramatic surge in violence and human rights violations”. The total number of civilians killed and injured in Afghanistan between January 1 and June 30 increased by 47%, compared with the first half of 2020, the UN mission on Afghanistan said on July 26.Tirumurti has also renewed India’s call for tackling terrorism in the region. “For enduring peace in Afghanistan, terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries in the region must be dismantled immediately and terrorist supply chains disrupted. It needs to be ensured that Afghanistan’s neighbours and the region are not threatened by terrorism, separatism and extremism. There needs to be zero tolerance for terrorism in all its manifestations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-for-actions-india-tells-unsc-on-afghanistan-101628268300036.html

The woman has filed the criminal complaint days after a team of independent investigators appointed by New York Attorney General Letitia James found that the Democratic governor sexually harassed multiple former and current state employees.The woman has been identified in the report as ‘Executive Assistant #1’. According to the report, Cuomo engaged in a pattern of inappropriate conduct with the assistant, including intimate hugs, at least one kiss on the lips, and touching her butt during hugs. Over time, the report said, Cuomo's behaviour escalated to more intimate physical contact, culminating in an incident where the governor reached under her “blouse and grabbed her breast.”The woman kept the groping incident to herself for over three months until her emotional outburst became visible to her colleagues when the governor claimed at a press conference that he had never “touched anyone inappropriately”, according to the report. She then confided to some of her colleagues about the alleged sexual harassment.Also Read | New York governor Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women, probe findsCuomo, who has vehemently denied the allegations, is facing possible criminal investigations in four New York counties as the damning report found the governor sexually harassed 11 women. The 165-page long report revealed that Cuomo’s “sexually harassing behaviour” was not limited to members of his own staff but extended to other State employees.The calls for Cuomo’s resignation have intensified after the report was published earlier this week. "I think he should resign. I understand that the state legislature may decide to impeach. I don't know that for a fact," US President Joe Biden said Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cuomos-ex-staffer-who-accused-him-of-groping-files-criminal-complaint-with-albany-sheriff-101628267124759.html
06-08-2021||World||Schools reopen with masks optional in many US classrooms||As Tussahaw Elementary opened this week for a new school year, teary-eyed mothers led in kindergartners dwarfed by backpacks and buses dropped off fifth graders looking forward to ruling their school. The biggest clue to the lingering COVID-19 crisis was the masks worn by students and teachers — but not all of them.Georgia, like most states, is leaving it up to local schools to decide whether to require face coverings. And 43,000-student Henry County, like many districts worn out by months of conflict over masks, has decided not to insist on them.Instead, they are “highly recommended.”Many parents Wednesday in this suburb south of Atlanta had mixed feelings about the policy. Some kept their children home in disagreement with it. Others sent their youngsters to class with face coverings.Shatavia Dorsey, the mother of a kindergartner and a fifth grader, said her children are going to wear their masks at school regardless of the rules.“They’re not vaccinated because they’re too young, and I don’t know if someone else is carrying it in,” said Dorsey, who is doubtful about the school system's ability to maintain in-person instruction amid rising infections.With the delta variant spreading rapidly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics have advised in recent weeks that everyone in schools wear masks in communities with substantial or high transmission.Educators have had to contend with strong resistance to masks from some parents and political leaders. Some consider mask rules an intrusion on parents' authority to make decisions about their children’s health.California, Louisiana, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington state intend to require masks for all students and teachers regardless of vaccination status. At the other end of the spectrum, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Utah have banned mask requirements in public schools.Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida said Thursday the decision of whether to wear masks in school should be made by parents, adding: “What are the harmful effects of putting a kindergartener in a mask for seven hours? Have they talked about the emotional, the academic, the physiological? Why isn’t CDC studying that?”Outbreaks that have hit schools at the very start of the year have added to calls for more mask requirements.In Marion, Arkansas, over 800 students and staff members have been quarantined because of exposure since classes began last week in the 4,000-student district.Marion Superintendent Glen Fenter urged lawmakers to overturn the state law banning masks, warning that a “full-blown crisis" could lie ahead. And Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson expressed regret over signing the ban in the first place and asked that it be lifted. But the GOP-controlled Legislature left it in place Friday.From the beginning of the pandemic to the peak of infections in January, CDC data showed children 15 and under had the lowest infection rates. Now, though, school-age children have infection rates higher than adults 50 and older.Henry County recorded 111 cases of COVID-19 in children ages 5 to 17 in the two weeks ending July 28. Its per capita rate is one of the highest in Georgia and higher than the nationwide figure.Henry County Superintendent Mary Elizabeth Davis said she believes schools have learned how to prevent transmission, citing intensified cleaning, air filtration and use of hand sanitizer. The district is also offering its 6,000 employees $1,000 bonuses to get vaccinated.“We are highly recommending that individuals opt for a mask as an added layer of prevention, but we also know so much more today than we did a year ago,” Davis said, wearing an “I got vaccinated” sticker. “And what we know today is that schools are not catalysts for community spread.”At least 28 of Georgia's more than 180 school districts are requiring masks, encompassing more than 38% of the state’s public school students.At Tussahaw Elementary, more than 60% of students were wearing masks in four classrooms visited by a reporter Wednesday, though some had pulled them down. In only one room, where the teacher was also unmasked, were a majority of students without face coverings.What parents at Tussahaw really wanted was some normalcy — an end to trying to help children at home learn virtually, or cycling between in-person school and quarantine.“We weathered the storm, but it's a lot better being back in the classroom," Bryant Thigpen said after dropping off his son for the first day of fifth grade. He said he thinks the school system should require masks — "at least until the cases go down.”Daniel Denny sent both his children to Tussahaw with masks but said face coverings should be up to parents.“To each his own,” he said. “You take care of your household how you choose.”Kimberly Vining, a parent of two middle school students, strongly approved of the policy, saying it will make things much easier for children with asthma or anxiety about wearing masks.“I have faith in God and I'm not going to live in fear for a virus that has a 98% survival rate,” she said.Overall, 90% of Henry County students are back in person, while 10% are opting for all-virtual instruction or a combination of both.Holley Freeman's 8-year-old daughter, Kalani, is one student who will be staying home and learning virtually. Freeman said that members of her household have health problems and that with no mask mandate, it would be unsafe for her daughter to go to school.“I feel really upset that we didn't have a safe choice,” Freeman said. “I feel really upset that our community betrayed us.”She said her daughter took the news hard: “She cried all the way home and cried all night and cried this morning, knowing she had to go online again."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/schools-reopen-with-masks-optional-in-many-us-classrooms-101628262776781.html
06-08-2021||World||On the frontline: Afghan woman governor recruits anti-Taliban militia||Salima Mazari sits nonchalantly in the front seat of a pickup as it cruises through a rural district of northern Afghanistan; a popular local song belts out from a loudspeaker stuck on top of the vehicle.Mazari, a female district governor in male-dominated Afghanistan, is on a mission -- recruiting men to fight the Taliban."Homeland... I sacrifice my life for you," the song goes -- and, these days, she is asking her constituents to do just that.The Taliban have swept through much of rural Afghanistan since early May, when US President Joe Biden called time on America's longest war and ordered his troops home.Life has changed little in many areas the insurgents have captured, but in Charkint -- the ruggedly remote district of mountains and valleys that Mazari governs, about an hour south of Mazar-i-Sharif in Balkh province -- the stakes are higher."Taliban are exactly the ones who trample human rights," she said.Under Taliban rule women and girls were denied education and employment, but even after the militants' downfall in 2001 attitudes have changed slowly."Socially, people were not ready to accept a female leader," Mazari told AFP, her head modestly covered with a butterfly-patterned shawl, her eyes hidden behind oversized sunglasses.Also Read | Don’t trust the Taliban, says Afghan envoy to China- Targeted community -Mazari is also a member of the Hazara community -- most of whom are Shia Muslims, who the Sunni Taliban consider a heretical sect.They have been regularly targeted by the Taliban and Islamic State fighters, including an attack on a school in the capital in May that killed more than 80 girls.Half the district Mazari nominally governs is already under Taliban control, so she spends a lot of time recruiting fighters to defend the rest.Hundreds of locals -- including farmers, shepherds and labourers -- have joined her cause, at enormous cost."Our people didn't have guns but they went and sold their cows, sheep, and even their land, to buy weapons," Mazari said."They are on the frontline every day and night without getting any kind of credit or salary."District police chief Sayed Nazir believes the only reason the Taliban haven't taken over is because of this local resistance."Our achievements are due to our people's support," he told AFP, still smarting from a leg wound he received recently fighting the Taliban.Mazari has so far recruited some 600 locals to supplement the conventional security forces in the district -- including Sayed Munawar, 53, who took up arms after 20 years of farming."We used to be craftsmen and workers until they attacked our villages," he told AFP at an outpost manned by police and local volunteers."They took a nearby village and raided their carpets and goods... we were forced to buy weapons and ammunition."- Studies put on hold -Faiz Mohammad, 21, is another volunteer -- putting his political science studies on hold to fight the Taliban.He hadn't seen combat until three months ago, but since then has fought three battles."The heaviest fight was a few nights ago when we had to repel seven attacks," he told AFP, dressed in civvies and listening to mournful Hazara music on a cheap Chinese-made cellphone.In Charkint, villagers still have bad memories of life under the Taliban before the hardline Islamic regime was toppled by the 2001 US-led invasion.And Governor Mazari knows if they return, they would never tolerate a woman in such a leadership position."Women would be banned from educational opportunities and our youth would be deprived of employment," she said, leading a meeting with militia commanders at her office, preparing for the next fight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-the-frontline-afghan-woman-governor-recruits-anti-taliban-militia-101628246490674.html
06-08-2021||World||Qatari envoy for conflict resolution in New Delhi to discuss war-torn Afghanistan||Qatar’s special envoy for conflict resolution Mutlaq bin Majed Al-Qahtani, who has played a key role in the Afghan peace process, on Friday met the external affairs ministry’s pointperson for Afghanistan to discuss the latest developments in the war-torn country. Al-Qahtani, who holds the official title of special envoy of the Qatari foreign minister for counter-terrorism and mediation of conflict resolution, is currently on a two-day visit to India. He met joint secretary JP Singh of the external affairs ministry’s Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran (PAI) desk and exchanged views on the current situation in Afghanistan and recent developments in the Afghan peace process, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. Al-Qahtani will meet foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday. He also met Sanjay Bhattacharya, the secretary responsible for consular issues and overseas Indian affairs on Friday. The Qatari diplomat’s visit to India comes days ahead of two key meetings in Doha on the situation in Afghanistan. Russia has convened a meeting of the “extended troika”, which includes China, the US and Pakistan, in Doha on August 11. Qatar will host a separate meeting between the Afghan side and its regional and international partners later this month. Various stakeholders are looking to these meetings to help revive the Afghan peace process, which has been stalled for several months, against the backdrop of the Taliban’s violent campaign to capture territory and urban areas, including provincial capitals. In June, Al-Qahtani had confirmed that Indian officials were engaged in talks with the Taliban – a development first reported by Hindustan Times. He told a webinar at the time that he believed the Indian side is engaging the Taliban as the group is seen as a “key component” in any future government in Kabul. He also said that Qatar would not recognise any group that seeks to take Afghanistan by force. India too has opposed any forcible takeover in Afghanistan, saying such a regime would lack legitimacy, and backed calls for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire and the resumption of negotiations to find a political settlement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/qatari-envoy-for-conflict-resolution-in-new-delhi-to-discuss-war-torn-afghanistan-101628261399821.html

Israel responded to Friday's rockets with artillery fire into Lebanon.As the Hezbollah fighters returned from the launch, "a number of citizens intercepted them" as they passed through the Chouaya area, Hezbollah said in a statement.A video circulated on social media and broadcast by Lebanese TV stations showed a crowd of men gathered around a blue, flat-back truck loaded with rocket launchers in Chouaya, a predominantly Druze area of the south.The Lebanese army said in a statement it had detained the "four people who launched the rockets and seized the launcher used in the operation".In its statement, Hezbollah said the launch had taken place "in a wooded area totally far from residential areas, to preserve the security of citizens".Hezbollah said it always took the utmost care to avoid exposing people to harm "during its resistance work", and would continue to do so.Walid Jumblatt, Lebanon's leading Druze politician, urged calm after the incident. "We hope that we all exit this tense atmosphere on social media," he wrote on Twitter.Hezbollah enjoys strong support among Shi'ites who form the majority in southern Lebanon, where its fighters helped drive out Israeli forces that occupied the area until 2000.But its powerful arsenal has long been a point of conflict in Lebanon, where its political opponents say the arsenal undermines the Lebanese state and should be handed over to the army.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-rare-challenge-hezbollah-fighters-held-after-rocket-launch-towards-israel-101628260722021.html
06-08-2021||World||Covid-19 vaccines may not stop Delta transmission, UK warns in initial findings||Initial findings on the Delta variant of Sars-CoV-2 indicate that the people vaccinated against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) may transmit the highly contagious strain as easily as the unvaccinated, Public Health England said on Friday. The findings come after concerns raised by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) over people’s infectiousness amid Delta variant spread.The variant of concern, first detected in India, is rapidly becoming the dominant variant across the globe, threatening the gains made by vaccination drives. In a report published by the PHE, scientists have said that vaccination will not completely stop coronavirus transmission even as they provide high levels of protection."Some initial findings ... indicate that levels of virus in those who become infected with Delta having already been vaccinated may be similar to levels found in unvaccinated people," PHE said in a statement.According to the report, the Delta variant now accounts for more than 99% of Covid-19 cases across the United Kingdom. Out of 1,467 patients hospitalised with confirmed cases of Delta variant, 55.1% were unvaccinated while 34.9% had received both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine. Also Read | South Africa may resume use of AstraZeneca vaccine amid Delta variant threatPHE warned that the UK will see a relatively higher percentage of vaccinated people in hospitals as the vaccination drive further expands."This may have implications for people's infectiousness, whether they have been vaccinated or not. However, this is early exploratory analysis and further targeted studies are needed to confirm whether this is the case," it added.The World Health Organization (WHO) in its latest epidemiological report said that three additional countries have reported Delta variant cases, taking the total number of such countries to 135.Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK health security agency, said in a statement vaccination is the best tool to protect ourselves from severe illness, however, they do not eliminate all risks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccines-may-not-stop-delta-transmission-uk-warns-in-initial-findings-101628254462683.html
06-08-2021||World||Iran President Raisi backs India’s role in establishing security in Afghanistan||Iran’s new President Ebrahim Raisi on Friday backed India’s role in the establishment of peace and security in Afghanistan and highlighted the need for a joint plan to elevate relations between Tehran and New Delhi. Raisi, who was formally sworn in on Thursday, made the remarks during a meeting with external affairs minister S Jaishankar, who represented India at the inauguration. Jaishankar tweeted after the meeting that there is “convergence” between the two sides on regional interests. Jaishankar’s two-day visit to Tehran coincided with India walking a diplomatic tightrope in its current role as president of the UN Security Council following demands from Britain and the US for a discussion on a deadly tanker attack off the coast of Oman that has been blamed on Iran. At his meeting with Jaishankar, Raisi stressed the importance of close cooperation and coordination between India and Iran in developing regional peace and stability, according to a statement from the Iranian president’s office. “Iran and India can play a constructive and useful role in ensuring security in the region, especially Afghanistan, and Tehran welcomes New Delhi’s role in establishment of security in Afghanistan,” Raisi said. The fate of Afghanistan, Raisi said, “must be decided by the Afghans themselves”. He contended that “if the Americans do not sabotage the situation, this issue will be resolved quickly”. Iran attaches “special importance” to extensive relations with India, and there is a need for a “joint cooperation programme” to elevate bilateral ties, Raisi said. “From today on, we should take new and distinct steps in the development of bilateral, regional and international relations with a new perspective,” he said. “By moving in the direction of a joint cooperation programme, we can take steps to bring about different conditions at the level of relations between the two countries in the interests of the two nations,” he added. Raisi said the Iranian government will pursue a policy of developing ties with neighbouring countries and the region, especially India. “There are various sectors, especially in the economic and commercial fields, as well as new technologies, that we should use to promote the level of our relations,” he added. Jaishankar tweeted that he had a “warm meeting” with Raisi, during which he conveyed the personal greetings of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “His commitment to strengthening our bilateral relationship was manifest. So too was the convergence in our regional interests,” he added. Bilateral ties took a massive hit after India stopped importing oil from Iran in mid-2019 because of sanctions imposed by the former Trump administration. At the time, Iran was among India’s top three energy suppliers. Iran has also been upset at the pace of development of Chabahar port by the Indian side. Recent moves by Tehran to develop a railway line to Chabahar and the Farzad B gas field without Indian involvement have not gone down well with New Delhi. However, two visits by Jaishankar have helped give fresh impetus to ties, especially at a time when the two countries have similar interests with regard to the situation in Afghanistan. Jaishankar was the first foreign leader to meet Raisi, then the president-elect, during a stopover in Tehran on July 9 while on his way to Russia. Iran ambassador Ali Chegeni said Jaishankar’s two visits to Iran and meetings with Raisi in less than a month “show the strong will of our leaders to expand bilateral relations and draw a very positive and promising vision”. However, the Indian side will still have to cope with the diplomatic crisis over last week’s drone attack on the tanker Mercer Street, managed by Israeli-owned Zodiac Maritime that killed two crew members – a Briton and a Romanian. The issue is set to be discussed by the UN Security Council amid claims by Britain and the US that Iran was behind the attack. Tehran has denied any involvement in the July 29 attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-president-raisi-backs-india-s-role-in-establishing-security-in-afghanistan-101628254859242.html

Wang Haijiang will oversee a massive military presence in the sprawling northwestern region that borders on several unstable Central Asian states, along with Pakistan and Afghanistan, from which U.S. troops are withdrawing.Like Xinjiang’s hardline Communist Party chief Chen Quanguo, Wang previously served in Tibet, which also hosts large numbers of troops to suppress anti-government sentiment among the native Tibetan population and guard the disputed border with India, where the two nations had a deadly clash last year.Wang's unannounced appointment was revealed on the Xinjiang Military District's social media feed showing him presiding at a retirement ceremony for senior officers on Wednesday.Wang saw combat during a border war with Vietnam in the early 1980s and served in an elite People's Liberation Army unit, according to state media reports.The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan is a particular concern for Beijing, which fears a resurgence of militant Islam along its border.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi last week hosted a delegation from the Taliban, which has been making rapid territorial gains in Afghanistan and is currently engaged in battles for major cities.Wang told the officials that China hopes the Taliban will focus on peace talks and work for unity among all factions and ethnic groups.He also said China hopes the Taliban will “deal resolutely” with the East Turkistan Islamic Movement, a group China claims is leading a push for independence in Xinjiang.Unconfirmed reports say several hundred fighters allied with the ETIM are present in northeastern Afghanistan, although many experts doubt the group even exists in any operational form.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-appoints-new-military-commander-in-restive-xinjiang-101628238951359.html

Arnault, chairman and chief executive of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has a net worth of $198.9 billion at the moment as per the dynamic list which may change anytime.Arnault’s net worth took a giant leap after LVMH completed a deal with American jeweller Tiffany & Co in January 2021 for $15.8 billion, which is believed to be the biggest luxury brand acquisition ever. In 2019, LVMH completed the acquisition of luxury hospitality group Belmond, which owns or manages 46 luxury hotels, restaurants, trains and river cruises.The 72-year-old chairman of the world's largest luxury goods company was on the third position on Forbes’ Billionaires 2021 list. He now oversees an empire of 70 brands, including Louis Vuitton and Sephora. Arnault has five children and four of them - Frédéric, Delphine, Antoine and Alexandre - work in corners of the LVMH empire, per Forbes.Bezos has slipped to the second position on Forbes real-time billionaires list even as the e-commerce giant, Amazon, thrived during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Amazon’s revenue grew by 38% in 2020 to $386 billion as the company saw a spike in online purchases from people staying at home due to Covid-19 restrictions. Bezos recently went to space on his space company’s Blue Origin’s suborbital flight.Tesla’s Elon Musk holds the third spot on the Forbes list with $185.5 billion. Musk was the world’s richest person at one point but Tesla’s decision to no longer accept Bitcoin pushed him out of the top position.Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg, Google’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Larry Ellison, Warren Buffett, and Francoise Bettencourt Meyers are among the world’s top 10 billionaires.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/louis-vuitton-s-bernard-arnault-is-now-world-s-richest-person-as-jeff-bezos-slips-101628251083606.html

How could you expect somebody with the same thinking to fight other people who are with the same thinking?” he said.In the readout issued by the Chinese government after the talks with Taliban, Wang called them a “significant military and political force” expected to play a key role in Afghanistan’s reconstruction.Qaem told Reuters that he would prefer that China was fully behind the Afghan government but also said that Beijing was transparent about its engagement with the Taliban, informing Afghanistan before extending its invitation and briefing it afterwards. “We have faith in the Chinese intentions.”Qaem said China could ask Pakistan to build trust with the Afghan government, given that Islamabad has long seen the Taliban as the best option for limiting the influence of India in Afghanistan.China could also serve as a conduit for messages from Kabul to the Taliban, as it was at last week’s meeting - relaying a government call for a ceasefire and an appeal for an inclusive political framework, he said.China can also help in boosting trade and buying more Afghan products such as saffron, he said. “So as long as that is provided, I don’t think China needs to send boots.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-trust-the-taliban-says-afghan-envoy-to-china-101628249638947.html
06-08-2021||World||China warming up faster than the world: Govt report||Climate crisis is pushing up temperatures in China at a rate faster than the global average and triggering extreme weather events more frequently, a new government report said this week.From 1951 to 2020, the average annual surface temperature in China showed a significant upward trend, with a warming rate of 0.26 degrees for every 10 years, it said.The Blue Book on Climate Change published this week by China’s National Climate Centre (NCC) said that the last 20 years have been the warmest since the beginning of the 20th century. It also said that 9 of the 10 warmest years since 1901 have been recorded in the 21st century.The NCC is country’s top climate research centre and affiliated with China Meteorological Administration (CMA).Glaciers in China, the source of many transnational rivers, are also showing an “accelerated melting trend”, the report said, adding that China is a “sensitive area”, which has been significantly affected by climate crisis.“From 1961 to 2020, China’s climate risk index showed an upward trend, and from 1991 to 2020, the average climate risk index (6.8) in China increased by 58% from the 1961-90 average (4.3),” the report added.China has been witnessing higher daytime temperatures - this July was hotter than previous years and the second-hottest since 1961 - while precipitation nationwide in July increased by 3.2% compared with previous years, the Sixth Tone news website said in its report, quoting the Blue Book.Sea levels off China’s coastal areas are rising as well at a worrying pace. “From 1980 to 2020, the rate of sea level rise along China’s coast was 3.4 mm per year, higher than the global average for the same period. In 2020, sea levels along China’s coast will be 73 mm higher than the 1993-2011 average, the third-highest level since 1980,” the report added.The report added that the incidence of extreme weather events such as high temperature and heavy precipitation has increased.From 1961 to 2020, the number of extreme heavy precipitation events in China had increased, it said, adding that the number of extreme low temperature events decreased.“… and the number of extreme high temperature events increased significantly since the mid-1990s, and the average intensity fluctuation of typhoons landing in China since the late 1990s increased,” it said.The CMA report comes within weeks of devastating floods in the central Chinese province of Henan, which killed over 300 people and affected millions more.During the floods, termed as an extreme weather event by experts, the provincial capital of Zhengzhou recorded a year’s worth of rainfall in a day, flooding large swathes of the city.The Chinese report coincided with a report released by Greenpeace East Asia on Thursday, which said “scorching temperatures are becoming much more frequent in cities across East Asia”.The Greenpeace report collated data from 57 cities across mainland China, Korea and Japan, which found that hot weather was arriving earlier in the year in more than 80% of cities.China is committed to achieving its major targets on fighting climate crisis, including realising a carbon emissions peak in 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality in 2060, President Xi Jinping said at the World Leaders’ Climate Summit in April this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warming-up-faster-than-the-world-govt-report-101628248138867.html

South African is currently using Pfizer-BioNTech and single-shot Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccines.Newly appointed South African health minister Joe Phaahla told a press briefing the government was planning to start using other vaccines, including Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccine."It was approved ... also that the AstraZeneca vaccine, which has now been shown to be effective against the Delta variant, that we should also look at bringing it back into use," Phaahla said.Earlier this year, the South African government halted the use of Covishield, a version of AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), after a study showed the vaccine provided minimal protection against mild to moderate illness caused by the Beta variant. South Africa sold the Covishied doses it had purchased from SII to African Union.Also Read | Majority of South Africans don't want Covid shot, many believe prayer more effectiveThe South African health minister’s remark suggests the country may consider using the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine again, given its high level of effectiveness against the Delta variant which is swiftly becoming the dominant strain across the world. A recent study of real-world data from Canada showed one dose of AstraZeneca’s Vaxzevria helped reduce hospitalisations or deaths by 87%.As Johnson & Johnson has applied for emergency use approval in India for its single-shot Covid-19 vaccine, its efficacy against variants announced by South Africa is encouraging. Glenda Gray, the joint lead investigator of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine trial in South Africa, said that the single-shot vaccine offers protection against severe disease and death.Gray told a media briefing that J&J shot, which is being used in the national vaccine programme alongside Pfizer's, offered 67% efficacy against infection when the Beta variant dominates and about 71% when the Delta variant dominates."Consistently after receiving the vaccine, there was very little death occurring in the vaccinated group as compared to the control group and showing a remarkable up to 96.2% protection against death," Gray said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-may-resume-use-of-astrazeneca-vaccine-amid-delta-variant-threat-101628245477961.html

Hezbollah's statement came after rockets triggered sirens in northern Israel and Golan Heights, indicating a swift escalation in the disputed Shebaa Farms region as tensions between Hezbollah's ally Iran and Israel flare-up."In response to the Israeli air raids... the Islamic Resistance shelled open territory near positions of Israeli occupation forces in the Shebaa Farms," the group said in a statement.The Israeli military said that the airstrikes were in retaliation to the rockets fired from across the border."More than 10 rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israeli territory. Most of the rockets were intercepted by the... aerial defence system while the rest of them landed in open areas adjacent to Har Dov," the Israeli air force said on Twitter.There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from either side.Meanwhile, UN peacekeeping forces in Lebanon have urged all parties to cease fire, saying that the situation in the region has turned very serious. Taking to Twitter, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) said that they have detected rocket launches from Lebanon and return artillery fire by Israel."This is a very serious situation and we urge all parties to cease fire," it said.The renewed cross-border hostilities have threatened the calm prevailing since 2006 when Israel fought a devastating one-month war with the Shiite militant group.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanons-hezbollah-claims-rocket-attack-on-israel-101628240485178.html

06-08-2021||World||Canadian PM wants Covid-19 vaccination to be mandatory for all govt employees||As the Canadian province of Quebec announced that it will introduce Covid-19 “vaccine passports”, the country’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau supported the move and said he’s exploring the idea of making it compulsory for all government employees to get a jab against the disease.Saying that there were “no more excuses” for not getting vaccinated against Covid-19, Trudeau revealed that he has already asked Canada’s senior-most bureaucrat, the clerk of the privy council, to consider his plan for mandating vaccination of government workers.“We need to get vaccinated to get through this pandemic, particularly with all the real concerns around the Delta variant we are facing that is striking hardest, obviously, in under-vaccinated and non-vaccinated people,” Trudeau said. He added that his administration was looking at government-regulated workplaces “to encourage or perhaps even to mandate vaccinations for those industries”.According to an estimate by the news outlet Global News, such a mandate would apply to nearly 1.3 million government employees.The Canadian PM said getting vaccinated against the coronavirus disease was “no longer a matter of individual choice” but of protecting “the community and our children who haven’t had the opportunity to be vaccinated”.According to latest data from Health Canada, about 64% per cent of the eligible population is fully vaccinated, while over 80% has received one dose.The provincial government of Quebec had earlier floated the possibility of so-called “vaccine passports” within its jurisdiction, and on Thursday, its premier Francois Legault announced that they will be introduced soon to make non-essential services such as going to restaurants or using gyms only available to those who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19.Canada has recorded a week-on-week 50% increase in the number of new Covid-19 cases, with 1,036 reported on Thursday. This surge is driven by the highly-transmissible Delta variant of the virus, and health authorities say the new spike can only be countered by speeding up vaccination rates.Speaking at an event in Montreal, Legault said the passport measure was meant to allow those fully jabbed to have “a somewhat normal life”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-pm-wants-covid-19-vaccination-to-be-mandatory-for-all-govt-employees-101628232357463.html

A release from the Indian high commission in Ottawa hailed the significance of the CDRI at this “crucial juncture as the world focuses on global resilience and recovery, following the collective global experience of managing the ravages of the pandemic”.Announcing the Canadian decision, minister of infrastructure and communities Catherine McKenna said, “People around the world are feeling the profound effects of climate change. From forest fires in Canada, to flooding in Europe to extreme heat in India, the impacts of a changing climate are real and significant. Canada recognises the need to join India and countries from around the globe to build a world that is more resilient to the impacts of climate change.” She pointed to the challenge thrown up by the Covid-19 pandemic, stating that the CDRI “has a significant role in this collective effort” for a global recovery.India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar had invited Ottawa to join the coalition and “welcomed Canada as a valued and trusted partner”, the release said.India’s high commissioner to Ottawa, Ajay Bisaria, said, “These partnerships will help ensure countries around the globe are better prepared to face international and domestic disasters of the future, including climate change, through mutual infrastructure and systems collaboration.”The CDRI describes itself as “a partnership of national governments, UN agencies and programmes, multilateral development banks and financing mechanisms, the private sector, and knowledge institutions that aims to promote the resilience of new and existing infrastructure systems to climate and disaster risks in support of sustainable development”.Among its members are the United States, the United Kingdom, The European Union, France, Germany, Japan, Australia and Brazil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-joins-international-coalition-launched-by-india-in-2019-101628230497465.html

And after this deadline, these quotas will be lost forever -- under the existing laws, news agency PTI reported.If such a huge number of green cards is wasted this year, the rise in the quota will be of no use. This year, the quota for green cards was raised from 1,40,000 to 2,61,500, but the pace at which the US Citizenship and Immigration Services processed the applications, around 1 lakh will be wasted. The number has been confirmed by the department of state office in charge of determining visa usage.To stop this wastage, a group of 125 Indian and Chinese nationals filed a lawsuit which pointed out that in 2020, the pandemic slowed down the process and an unusually low number of family-based green cards were approved in 2020.Also Read: US lawmakers take another shot at removing per-country cap of green cardsA delegation of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community met US President Joe Biden and vice president Kamala Harris on Thursday and one of the issues discussed was immigration.“There are hundreds of thousands of gainfully employed legal immigrants in the US who would benefit from these Green Cards. Many of them have been waiting for a decade or more to adjust to permanent resident status but have been unable to do so due to a lack of available visa numbers,” PTI quoted Indian professional Sandeep Pawar as saying.Pawar has been fighting for the rights of Indian professionals waiting for decades to get this permanent resident card in the United States. "Most potential beneficiaries, such as myself, are from India, a country that is the most backlogged due to inherently racist and discriminatory per-country quotas embedded in the Immigration and Nationality Act. Many have spouses, mostly women, who are unable to work until they become permanent residents," Pawar said.Republican senator Mike Lee has recently said that the backlog of an Indian national to get permanent residency in the US is more than 195 years. Someone from India entering the backlog today would have to wait 195 years to receive an EB-3 green card. Even if we give their children this limbo status, none of them will have a prayer of becoming a US citizen," the senator said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-lakh-green-cards-likely-to-be-wasted-this-year-report-101628229349135.html

The change, announced by the department for transport, comes into effect from Sunday.Under the United Kingdom's traffic light system for international travel, returning from amber list countries means 10-day quarantining at home or any place of one's choice. "The UAE, Qatar, India and Bahrain will be moved from the red list to the amber list. All changes come into effect Sun 8th August at 4 am," UK transport secretary Grant Shapps tweeted.Indians can now quarantine at a place of their choice for 10 days after arriving in the UK. They will retain the option to Test to Release after five days of quarantine, reports news agency PTI.Passengers from India will now take a Covid-19 test three days before departure and book in advance for two Covid-19 tests to be taken upon arrival in England as well as complete a passenger locator form on arrival.After arriving in the United Kingdom, the passengers must quarantine at home or in any place they have confirmed as their location for 10 days and test on or before day two and on or after day eight.Those who are below 18 years of age and those fully vaccinated in the UK are exempted from home quarantine, so are those who have received two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine in the European Union and the United States.However, India-manufactured Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine Covishield is likely to be covered under this exemption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-moves-india-from-red-to-amber-list-all-you-need-to-know-101628220904346.html

New South Wales reported a record 291 cases, up from 262. One more person has died, raising the state total to 22 during the latest outbreak, all in Sydney.The dead person was an unvaccinated woman in her 60s who died in a Sydney hospital after contracting the coronavirus from a healthcare worker. There are 304 cases in hospitals in New South Wales, with 50 people in intensive care, 22 of whom require ventilation.Of particular concern is the growing number of people positive with the highly infectious Delta strain moving around in the community, particularly in Sydney's southwestern suburbs. Around one-fifth of Friday's cases have spent time outside while infectious.Officials in the neighbouring state of Victoria, which on Thursday night entered its sixth lockdown since the pandemic began, warned the state was "in a precarious position" as officials try to trace the source of several unlinked new cases."We have many lines of inquiry actively underway as to where these new cases have been and any further exposure sites," state Health Minister Martin Foley said in a media conference.Faced with another lockdown within weeks, an anti-lockdown protest erupted in state capital Melbourne on Thursday night.Victoria reported six locally acquired Covid-19 cases on Friday, down from eight a day earlier, with all linked but not in quarantine during their infectious period.In Brisbane, the state capital of Queensland, the authorities reported 10 new cases, down from 16 the day before, and added that they were hopeful a lockdown would be lifted as planned on Sunday since all but two cases were isolated before testing positive.LOCKDOWN WOESMore than 60% of Australia's 25 million citizens are in hard lockdowns on Friday to try to contain latest surge, including the country's three largest cities - Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.Snap lockdowns, strict border controls and swift contact tracing have helped Australia keep its coronavirus numbers relatively low, with just over 35,600 cases and 933 deaths. But recent stop-and-start lockdowns amid a sluggish vaccination rollout, with only about 21% of people above 16 fully vaccinated, have frustrated residents.Australia has also enacted tough border controls requiring residents to apply for exemptions to leave and incoming overseas travellers, capped at around 3,000 a week, must go through a two-week mandatory quarantine.The rules will further tighten from Aug. 11 by removing an automatic exemption for citizens and permanent residents living outside of Australia to leave, a government statement tabled in the parliament on Thursday showed.The change would require all citizens and permanent residents living outside the country to apply for permission to exit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-spreads-in-sydney-as-australia-widens-covid-19-restrictions-101628222363167.html

The lawsuit was filed on Thursday in a federal court in Brooklyn, New York by 115 Gold Star families or relatives of American military service members killed in the war and relatives of noncombatants, claiming they “knowingly facilitated transfers of millions” of dollars that provided aid to terrorists in the region, according to reports.According to the lawsuit, transactions involving syndicate agents, operatives and fronts in countries including Afghanistan, Pakistan, Russia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) raised red flags that they were dealing with terrorist money.Also read | Halting Taliban attacks focus of UNSC meeting under Indian presidency“The terrorists used defendants’ laundromats to change dirty money into clean money and convert dirty foreign currency into clean US dollars. Defendants knew they were aiding terrorism and yet did so anyway,” they said in the complaint.The complainants include civilians, members of the military and families of people killed or wounded in Afghanistan from 2011 to 2016. They claim Americans were attacked by a terrorist syndicate led by al Qaeda and the Haqqani Network, an extreme faction of the Taliban.They allege the banks aided and abetted acts of terrorist violence against Americans in Afghanistan and that they aided and abetted a racketeering enterprise consisting of al Qaeda and the Haqqani Network’s terrorism campaign. The complaint seeks unspecified money damages which could reach into the billions of dollars.Also read | UNSC condemns Afghanistan violence, says it won’t support ‘Islamic emirate’They sued the banks under the US Anti-Terrorism Act, which was passed in 1990 and allows victims of terrorism to recover damages. In 2016, Congress broadened the law as it passed the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. This act allows suits against people, organisations and countries that provide direct or indirect support to terrorists that target the United States.According to The New York Times, the complainants say the banks’ treatment of some of their clients indicated that they understood how their services were connected to illegal activities.Also read | Afghanistan's situation will change in 6 months, says president Ashraf GhaniDeutsche Bank, the suit alleges, charged higher-than-normal rates to move money around the world for some of its clients, including a Pakistani man whom the US government had flagged as a money launderer for terrorists.

Michael McCaul (R-Texas), the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, released the third installment in his investigation into the origins of the virus and the missteps by China in alerting the world to the risks of the pandemic."What the US congressmen have done smears and slander China in pursuit of political gains," Daily Mail quoted the statement from the Chinese foreign ministry. "We express categorical opposition to and strong condemnation of such despicable acts that have no moral bottom line," it added.The Republican report is based on open-source material and draws conclusions from circumstantial reporting, also raises concern that the lab was conducting "gain of function" research, controversial medical research where scientists genetically modify a bacteria or virus to make it more infectious in an effort to study better preventative measures, in an unsafe environment, reported The Hill.McCaul also called on the House Foreign Affairs Committee to subpoena Peter Daszak, an American scientist who has come under scrutiny for his connection with the Wuhan lab and involvement in publishing an open letter in February 2020 that rejected the lab theory as a xenophobic distraction from the pandemic response.The letter, which was published in the Lancet medical journal, has since come under criticism as an attempt to divert attention from China's responsibility for the virus outbreak."Now is the time to use all of the tools the US government has to continue to root out the full truth of how this virus came to be," McCaul said."That includes subpoenaing Peter Daszak to appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee to answer the many questions his inconsistent -- and in some instances outright and knowingly inaccurate -- statements have raised. It also includes Congress passing legislation to sanction scientists at the WIV [Wuhan Institute of Virology] and CCP [Chinese Communist Party] officials who participated in this coverup. This was the greatest coverup of all time and has caused the deaths of more than four million people around the world, and people must be held responsible."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-dismisses-republican-report-on-origin-of-covid19-101628212313686.html

"Let me be clear -- we have a zero-tolerance policy on this," the memo read, referring to the media organisation's strict stance on the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-related protocols.The CNN memo, first obtained by AP, was later tweeted by media reporter Oliver Darcy. The organisation, however, offered no official details on the firing.Jeff Zucker adds in his memo to CNN staff: "In the past week, we have been made aware of three employees who were coming to the office unvaccinated. All three have been terminated. Let me be clear -- we have a zero-tolerance policy on this."CNN chief Zucker has indicated that there will be very little leeway for employees when it comes to adherence to Covid-19 protocols.Vaccines are mandatory, whether the employees report to the office or are out on the field (where they might come in contact with others), said Zucker in the internal company memo to his staff members. While proof of vaccination has currently been left to the honour system, that may change in the upcoming weeks, he said.CNN has left most of its offices open, that employees are free to attend on a voluntary basis. However, masks are mandatory in the Atlanta, Washington, and Los Angeles offices when people are not eating, drinking, or in an enclosed private space. Even in offices where mask-wearing is not mandated, people should do what feels comfortable to them “without any fear of retaliation or judgment from co-workers,” Zucker highlighted in the memo.The CNN chief's strict reminder comes at a time when the United States is dealing with rampant vaccine hesitancy, even in Covid-19 hotspots like the state of Wyoming. Viral videos of people having meltdowns over masks are commonplace, and in many parts of the United States, it is not uncommon for two complete strangers to confront each other publicly over the issue of wearing masks or getting a shot of vaccine.CNN is currently planning a company-wide return to the office on September 7, but it might be delayed until at least early to mid-October, reported AP, adding that more than a third of news staff members have already returned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/zero-tolerance-cnn-fires-3-employees-for-showing-up-to-office-unvaccinated-101628210090944.html
06-08-2021||World||Hiroshima Day 2021: History, significance, and impacts of World War II atomic bombings||August 6, 2021, observed solemnly as Hiroshima Day around the world, will be the 76th anniversary of the atomic bombing of the Japanese city in the final year of World War II. On this day in 1945, the United States dropped the very first deployed nuclear bomb in the city of Hiroshima, wiping out an estimated 39 per cent of the population, most of who were civilians. Along with the atomic bombing of Nagasaki three days later, these instances remain the only recorded use of nuclear weapons in armed conflict.Hiroshima Day: HistoryHiroshima bombings of 1945 were "necessitated", as said by the United States, as the Allied Forces continued to struggle against Japan even after Germany's surrender in World War II. In reports that have since been revealed, it has been known that the US administration at the time practically believed that the use of a nuclear weapon would force Japan to yield and save millions of casualties in the process.Also Read | Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Japan's surrender: Those 9 dark daysThe Manhattan Project, commissioned by the US, created two atomic bombs. The first one, called 'The Little Boy' was dropped in the city of Hiroshima while the second one, dubbed 'The Fat Man', was dropped in Nagasaki by the US on August 6 and 9, respectively.Hiroshima saw the terrors of the atomic weapon the moment an American B-29 bomber dropped it on the city. An estimated 90,000 to 140,000 people were killed instantly, while thousands more were hit with generational defects that are plaguing a section of the populace to this day.Hiroshima Day: SignificanceHiroshima Day 2021 will commemorate, like every year, the 1945 tragedy which completely destroyed the two cities and left the country to deal with a dreadful fate even in its aftermath. It reminds the world that all wars are terrible, and nuclear warfare even more so. It reminds thousands of politicians, diplomats, and envoys around the world that diplomacy is the only option while navigating geopolitics in the 21st century because only nine countries in the entire world currently possess more than 13,000 nuclear weapons.Hiroshima Day serves as a day of remembrance and a focus for anti-war and anti-nuclear demonstrations in several countries. Several people also take the time to visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum on this day, which documents the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in World War II.Hiroshima Day: The legacy of nuclear warfareHiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings of 1945 are an eerie reminder for the world of the devastating effects of nuclear warfare that two recorded instances in history left for humankind.Together, the two nuclear attacks killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people. Radiation poisoning, what was referred to as "atomic bomb disease", left people with an increased risk of cancer, birth defects, severe mental retardation, among other diseases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hiroshima-day-2021-history-significance-and-impacts-of-world-war-ii-atomic-bombings-101628207098035.html

It’s about everybody else also.”Fauci’s warning came as the US hit a six-month high for new Covid cases with over 100,000 infections reported on Wednesday, according to Reuters.The Biden administration is taking the first steps towards requiring nearly all international visitors to the US to be vaccinated against the disease.In France, a constitutional court on Thursday validated most aspects of a new law that, starting next week, requires people to carry a Covid-19 health pass to access cafes, restaurants and long-distance travel.
