Trudeau said the Taliban seizing the power in Afghanistan by force was the reason Canada won't recognise the Islamist fundamentalist group as the government."Canada has no plans to recognize the Taliban as the Government of Afghanistan," Trudeau told reporters. "They have taken over and replaced a duly elected democratic government by force."Statements from countries like Russia and Turkey have been positive on the takeover, indicating that they may recognise the Taliban as the legitimate stakeholders.(with inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-will-not-recognise-taliban-as-afghan-govt-says-pm-justin-trudeau-101629221046161.html
17-08-2021||World||Withdrawal of diplomats to India’s emergency e-visa move: Key developments in Afghan crisis||India on Tuesday withdrew its ambassador and diplomatic staff from Kabul, flying out some 150 people in a C-17 Globemaster heavy lift aircraft from the Afghanistan capital two days after a Taliban takeover of the war-torn country. Another 45 diplomats and security personnel were brought back by a C-17 aircraft on Monday as part of an extensive evacuation programme that was kept tightly under wraps and put into motion after the Indian side received credible inputs about possible threats from rouge elements and Pakistani terror groups.The two C-17s flew into Kabul using a circuitous route through Iranian airspace and over the Arabian Sea to avoid flying over Pakistan or spending too much time in the uncontrolled Afghan airspace. As the Kabul airport is small and the aircraft were offered slots of limited duration, the C-17s halted in the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe till it was time for them to fly into Kabul to pick up their passengers. “In view of the prevailing situation in Kabul, it was decided that our embassy personnel would be immediately moved to India. This movement has been completed in two phases and the ambassador and all other India-based personnel have reached New Delhi [on Tuesday] afternoon,” the external affairs ministry said.The withdrawal of ambassador Rudrendra Tandon and other staff from Kabul reflected India’s misgivings about the Taliban’s assurances that all embassies and diplomats would be provided security. Taliban spokesman Suhail Saheen had tweeted on Monday night that no problems will be created for diplomats, embassies and charitable workers but this failed to reassure the Indian side. Tandon, who had taken up his assignment in Kabul only in August last year, told reporters during an interaction at Gujarat’s Jamnagar airbase, where the C-17 jet halted to refuel on Tuesday, that some Indian citizens were still in Afghanistan and Air India would continue operating flights from Kabul as long as the airport there remains functional to bring them back. He added, “As you know, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan no longer exists and the situation is quite fluid now.” Air India has temporarily suspended its flights to Kabul because of conditions at the airport, but the external affairs ministry has opened a help desk and will ensure that anyone stuck in Kabul is brought back, he said. Asked about the number of Indian nationals who are still in Afghanistan, Tandon said it would be difficult to give an exact figure as Indians didn’t always register themselves with the embassy in Kabul despite advisories. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that at least 300 Indian nationals, including those working for Western firms and other professionals, were believed to be in Afghanistan. Flights by Air India to bring back these Indians are expected to resume once the civilian side of Kabul’s Hamid Karzai international airport reopens. The airport, currently under the control of US troops, was closed on Monday following chaotic scenes as thousands of Afghans seeking to flee the Taliban entered the facility and marched onto the tarmac. Some desperately clung onto a US military aircraft and at least two people plunged to their death.External affairs minister S Jaishankar was involved in efforts to oversee the timely departure of the two military flights that evacuated the diplomats and other nationals. At almost 3 am on Tuesday, he tweeted about his discussions in this regard with US secretary of state Antony Blinken: “Discussed latest developments in Afghanistan with @SecBlinken. Underlined the urgency of restoring airport operations in Kabul.” On Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security to assess the situation in Afghanistan. The meeting was attended by Jaishankar, home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and ambassador Tandon. Meanwhile, the Union home ministry announced on Tuesday it had reviewed visa provisions in view of the situation in Afghanistan and introduced a new category of electronic visas called “e-Emergency X-Misc Visa” to fast-track applications by Afghan nationals. India has also received requests from Afghan Sikh and Hindu community leaders and is in touch with them.The people cited above said the Indian embassy in Kabul was technically not shut down as it is still being manned by local Afghan staff – an arrangement similar to the one made for the consulates in Kandahar and Mazar-e-Sharif, from where all Indian staff were pulled out in recent weeks as the security situation deteriorated. The local staff have been given specific assignments and are being paid their salaries.The decision regarding the withdrawal of India’s diplomatic personnel and other staff was based on two factors – the security of the personnel and ensuring that their departure was not perceived as abandonment by Afghan partners. An earlier Indian assessment had suggested the Taliban would continue negotiations to gain legitimacy, at least till August 31, when the US drawdown was to be completed, but the situation changed swiftly as the Taliban marched towards Kabul over the weekend.Afghan law enforcement personnel and police forces “simply vanished” and were replaced by the Taliban, one of the people cited above said. That was when the green signal was given to withdraw all personnel from the embassy in Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/withdrawal-of-diplomats-to-india-s-emergency-e-visa-move-key-developments-in-afghan-crisis-101629222100312.html
17-08-2021||World||Embassies, aid organisations will be safe in Kabul: Taliban's Mujahid||The Taliban held its maiden news conference on Tuesday days after taking control of Kabul, in which they assured security of embassies and diplomatic missions in Afghanistan.Addressing the reporters in Kabul, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said the security of foreign embassies is important to them and pledged to keep them completely safe, Afghanistan's television news channel Tolo News reported.Mujahid says that the security of foreign embassies is important to them and they pledge that the embassies will be completely safe. pic.twitter.com/uNf6zOc4lkZabihullah Mujahid reportedly said the Taliban do not have "enmity towards anyone" and have "pardoned everyone" on their leader's orders.Earlier in the day, the Taliban declared an “amnesty” across Afghanistan and urged women to join its government in an attempt to allay the fears of thousands of Afghans who attempted to flee the country. Mujahid says they have pardoned everyone and will not take revenge against anyone, including former military members and those who worked with the foreign forces. "No one will search their house," Mujahid says. pic.twitter.com/JGE6jTgzRNMujahid said the Taliban would honour women’s rights but within the norms of Islamic law. He echoed the voice of Enamullah Samangani, a member of the Taliban’s cultural commission, who said earlier in the day that women are encouraged to join the government."Taliban are committed to providing women with their rights based on Islam. Women can work in the health sector and other sectors where they are needed. There will be no discrimination against women," TOLO News quoted Mujahid as saying.The Taliban spokesperson outlined that they would work a settlement through which an "Islamic government would be established in the country".ALSO READ | Turkey welcomes 'positive messages' from Taliban after 'amnesty' announcementAfter taking over the presidential palace in Kabul on Sunday, and setting the stage for their rule in Afghanistan, 20 years after their ouster, the Taliban attempted to project a less aggressive face by saying no one would be "harmed", assurance thousands of Afghans are apprehensive of. Assuring the former members of the Afghan army and police, Mujahid said the translators and contractors who worked with international forces since 2001 would not be harmed.United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres had on Monday urged the Taliban to "exercise utmost restraint" to protect lives.ALSO READ | UN not fully convinced with Taliban’s promise of peace and inclusivity.

17-08-2021||World||Taliban vow to honour Afghan women's rights, but within 'Islamic law'||The Taliban vowed Tuesday to respect women's rights, forgive those who resisted them and ensure a secure Afghanistan as part of a publicity blitz aimed at convincing world powers and a fearful population that they have changed.Following a lightning offensive across Afghanistan that saw many cities fall to the insurgents without a fight, the Taliban have sought to portray themselves as more moderate than when they imposed a brutal rule in the late 1990s. But many Afghans remain skeptical — and thousands raced to the airport on Monday, desperate to flee the country.Older generations remember the Taliban’s ultraconservative Islamic views, which included severe restrictions on women as well as public stonings and amputations before they were ousted by the U.S-led invasion following the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.As others have in recent days, spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid addressed these concerns head-on in his first news conference Tuesday.Mujahid, who had been a shadowy figure for years, promised the Taliban would honor women’s rights, but within the norms of Islamic law, though he gave few details. He said the group wanted private media to “remain independent,” but stressed journalists “should not work against national values.”And he promised the insurgents would secure Afghanistan — but seek no revenge against those who worked with the former government or with foreign governments or forces.“We assure you that nobody will go to their doors to ask why they helped,” he said.Earlier, Enamullah Samangani, a member of the Taliban’s cultural commission, made similar promises, saying the Taliban would extend an “amnesty” without giving details and encouraging women to join the government.The capital of Kabul remained quiet for another day as the Taliban patrolled its streets and many residents stayed home, fearful after the insurgents’ takeover saw prisons emptied and armories looted. Many women have expressed dread that the two-decade Western experiment to expand their rights and remake Afghanistan would not survive the resurgent Taliban.Germany, meanwhile, halted development aid to Afghanistan over the Taliban takeover. Such aid is a crucial source of funding for the country — and the Taliban's efforts to project a milder version of themselves may be aimed at ensuring that money continues to flow.While the Taliban pledged not to go after their enemies, some in Kabul allege the fighters have lists of people who cooperated with the government and are seeking them out. A broadcaster in Afghanistan said she was hiding at a relative’s house, too frightened to return home much less return to work following reports that the insurgents are also looking for journalists. She said she and other women didn't believe the Taliban had changed their ways. She spoke on condition of anonymity because she feared for her safety.Samangani addressed the concerns of women, saying a Taliban were ready to "provide women with environment to work and study, and the presence of women in different (government) structures according to Islamic law and in accordance with our cultural values.”That would be a marked departure from the last time the Taliban were in power, when women were largely confined to their homes.In another sign of the Taliban's efforts to portray a new image, a female television anchor on the private broadcaster Tolo interviewed a Taliban official on camera Tuesday in a studio — an interaction that once would have been unthinkable. Meanwhile, women in hijabs demonstrated briefly in Kabul, holding signs demanding the Taliban not “eliminate women” from public life.Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the United Nations’ high commissioner for human rights, noted both the Taliban’s vows and the fears of everyday Afghans.“Such promises will need to be honored, and for the time being — again understandably, given past history — these declarations have been greeted with some skepticism,” he said in a statement. “There have been many hard-won advances in human rights over the past two decades. The rights of all Afghans must be defended.”Germany, meanwhile, suspended development aid to Afghanistan, estimated at 250 million euros ($294 million) for 2021. Other funding separately goes to security services and humanitarian aid. Sweden indicated it would slow aid to the country, but Britain committed to an increase.British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said humanitarian aid could rise by 10%. He said the aid budget would be reconfigured for development and humanitarian purposes and that the Taliban would not get any money previously earmarked for security.Meanwhile, Kabul's international airport, the only way out for many, reopened to military evacuation flights under the watch of American troops.All flights were suspended on Monday when thousands of people rushed the airport. In shocking scenes captured on video, some clung to a plane as it took off and then fell to their deaths. At least seven people died in chaos at the airport, U.S. officials said.By late Tuesday, the Taliban entered the civilian half of the airport, firing into the air to drive out around 500 people there, said an Afghan official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to brief journalists.Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said U.S. commanders at the airport are communicating with Taliban leaders to keep the airlift going, adding that there have been no hostile actions by the Taliban.Still, there were indications that the situation remained tenuous. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul, now operating from the airport, urged Americans to register online for evacuations but not come to the airport before being contacted.The German Foreign Ministry said a first German military transport plane landed in Kabul, but it took off with only seven people on board due to continued chaos. Another left later with 125 people.Across Afghanistan, the International Committee of the Red Cross said thousands had been wounded in fighting as the Taliban swept across the country in recent days, ahead of the planned withdrawal of the last American troops at the end of the month.As U.S. President Joe Biden did, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg blamed the swift collapse of the country on a failure of Afghan leadership. But he added that the alliance must also uncover flaws in its effort to train the Afghan military.Talks continued Tuesday between the Taliban and several Afghan government officials, including former President Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, who once headed the country’s negotiating council.Discussions focused on how a Taliban-dominated government would operate given the changes in Afghanistan over the last 20 years, rather than just dividing up who controlled what ministries, officials with knowledge of the negotiations said. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential details of the talks.A top Taliban leader, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, arrived in Kandahar on Tuesday night from Qatar. His arrival may signal a deal is close at hand.But in a possible complication, the vice president of the ousted government claimed on Twitter Tuesday that he was the country's “legitimate” caretaker president. Amrullah Saleh said, under the constitution, he should be in charge because President Ashraf Ghani has fled the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-vow-to-honour-afghan-women-s-rights-but-within-islamic-law-101629217859737.html
17-08-2021||World||'Shameful': Macron sparks controversy with Afghan illegal migration pledge||French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday faced accusations from the left and activists that he was letting down ordinary Afghans after he pledged a robust European approach against illegal migration in the wake of the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban.His stance however gladdened the right in France in what is due to be one of the most contentious battlegrounds as Macron prepares for 2022 presidential elections that may come down to a duel with the far-right.Macron promised in a televised address on Monday that France would "protect those who are most under threat in Afghanistan" while also vowing Europe would put together a "robust" initiative to thwart illegal migration and in particular people-smuggling networks."We must anticipate and protect ourselves against significant irregular migratory flows that would endanger the migrants and risk encouraging trafficking of all kinds," he said.Macron also said France was ready to help Afghan activists, artists and journalists who risk being targeted because of their work, but it is not immediately clear what numbers this will entail.Green MP Matthieu Orphelin, a former member of Macron's ruling party, accused Macron "of mixing up asylum and irregular migration". Fellow Green Yannick Jadot, a possible contender in 2022, said he was "astonished to hear that people fleeing the "hell of the Taliban could be considered a threat".Prominent Socialist senator Laurence Rossignol called the comments "cynical" and shameful" while centrist MP Aurelien Tache, another former member of Macron's party, said he hoped the "president would not be so tough when it comes to acts"."People who flee war, oppression and death are not irregular migratory flows," said Dominique Sopo, head of the NGO SOS Racisme.The League for Human Rights said with his comments Europe was "sub-contracting asylum for Afghans to neighbouring countries".- 'Firm against trafficking' -France, like several other European countries, has suspended the expulsion of Afghan asylum seekers. More Afghans applied for asylum in France in 2020 than from any other nation."France is very attentive to the situation of the Afghans," said a French presidential official, asking not to be named."But that does not prevent us being very firm in the face of trafficking and networks who profit from misery and fear. This would be proof of naivety and lack of responsibility."Far-right leader Marine Le Pen, potentially Macron's main challenger in the elections, warned that "for our country this situation will mean an increased risk of attacks and the possibility of new waves of immigration".Heavyweight right-wing former minister Xavier Bertrand, who is also standing in the elections, warned: "The Afghan crisis will continue in the form of a migration wave in Europe".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shameful-macron-sparks-controversy-with-afghan-illegal-migration-pledge-101629217510353.html

17-08-2021||World||Afghan crisis: Granddaughter of Frontier Gandhi says world powers must intervene||As Afghanistan plunged into a state of panic and chaos while Taliban fighters poured into Kabul on Sunday, more than 2,000 kilometres away in Kolkata, 50-year-old Yasmin Nigar Khan prayed for the safety and security of the people there. She hopes for world powers to intervene to end the crisis.“What we are hearing and seeing on media is very worrying. I am not sure what’s in store for the future. But this should come to an end. I hope the world powers, the United Nations would intervene and put an end to this,” said Khan.Family members claim Khan’s father, Khan Lala Jaan Khan, who died in 1996, was adopted by Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, better known as ‘Frontier Gandhi’, to continue the struggle for Pashtunistan from India.Khan Lala Jaan Khan settled in Kolkata and formed the All India Pakhtoon Jirga-e-Hind (an organisation of Pakhtoons or Pathans in India) in 1949.“I visited Kabul with my father for the first and last time in 1986 to attend a meeting of tribal leaders from across the world. I have very fond memories of the country. Back then, I saw girls wearing jeans and skirts even though they had their hijab on. But look at the country now. It is shattered. Four decades of war have ruined everything,” said Yasmin.She took over as the president of the All India Pakhtoon Jirga-e-Hind after her father’s death. A laminated picture of Frontier Gandhi and a portrait of him along with Mahatma Gandhi could be seen on the table in her office at Karim Hussain Lane near Park Circus in southeast Kolkata.“Even though I don’t have any relatives in Afghanistan, there are many Pakhtoons in Kolkata and West Bengal who have their loved ones back in that country. They are getting calls every day. What we are seeing on media could be just the tip, as social media has been blocked and people are afraid of saying anything in open,” said Arshad Ahmed Danish Khan, her brother, who is the secretary of the organization.In 1892, Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore wrote the iconic short story, Kabuliwala - a tale of an Afghan citizen living in Kolkata. In 1957, noted director Tapan Sinha made a film on it.“My father was sent to India by Frontier Gandhi and he settled in Kolkata. The Pakhtuns have always had an emotional attachment to Kolkata,” said Arshad, who, along with her sister Yasmin, was born and brought up in Kolkata.The family says that most of the Afghan people would not like the Taliban, as they are not from Afghanistan. They are ‘outsiders’“I am sure 90% of the citizens in Afghanistan would not like the Taliban. When I went to Afghanistan back then there were the mujahedeen. Even they were better than the Taliban. The Taliban fighters are a proxy army created by Pakistan. I am sure if people’s mandate is taken, they would not get even 10% votes. We all want peace,” said Yasmin||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-powers-must-intervene-to-end-afghan-crisis-granddaughter-of-frontier-gandhi-101629211776571.html

On Sunday, Ashraf Ghani's former deputy said he'll never betray the "soul" and "legacy of my hero Ahmad Shah Masoud", the late Afghan politician and military commander who fought against the Soviet occupation between 1979 and 1989.Earlier today, Saleh called on anti-Taliban groups to join the "resistance", saying they have not lost spirit unlike the United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato)."It is futile to argue with@POTUS on Afg now. Let him digest it. We d Afgs must prove tht Afgh isn't Vietnam & the Talibs aren't even remotely like Vietcong. Unlike US/NATO we hvn't lost spirit & see enormous oprtnities ahead.

UN human rights office spokesperson Rupert Colville told reporters in Geneva that given the past history of the Taliban, such promises have been greeted with scepticism.“Nevertheless, the promises have been made, and whether or not they are honoured or broken will be closely scrutinized,” the spokesperson said.The Taliban have made a slew of promises to calm the nerves as thousands of Afghans thronged Kabul airport in a desperate attempt to flee the war-torn country now under the control of Islamist fundamentalists.

17-08-2021||World||New Zealand to enter lockdown after single virus case found||New Zealand's government took drastic action Tuesday by putting the entire nation into a strict lockdown for at least three days after finding a single case of coronavirus infection in the community.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern invoked some of the stirring rhetoric she used early in the pandemic by urging the “team of 5 million” — New Zealand's population — to go hard and early in trying to eliminate the latest outbreak."We have seen what happens elsewhere if we fail to get on top of it," Ardern said. “We only get one chance.”She said Auckland, where the infected man lives, and Coromandel, where he had visited, would go into a full lockdown for seven days and the remainder of the country for three days while health experts tried to find the source of his infection.The developments prompted people to line up outside supermarkets to stock up on essential items and sparked a sharp drop in the value of the New Zealand dollar.New Zealand had managed to stamp out the virus, and the last outbreak was in February. But Ardern had been warning that the contagiousness of the delta variant would likely require more drastic action than previous outbreaks.New Zealand has also been slower than other developed nations to inoculate its population, leaving it vulnerable to outbreaks. Only 32% of people have had at least one shot and 18% are fully vaccinated.And officials have been viewing a growing outbreak in nearby Sydney with alarm, saying they don't want to make the same mistakes by waiting too long to impose strict measures.Health officials said genome testing would not verify until Wednesday whether the infected 58-year-old man had the delta variant, although they were working under the assumption he does.Officials said they could not immediately find a connection between the man and the handful of people who have tested positive while isolating in quarantine after arriving from abroad. The border is seen as the most likely source of any outbreaks.The move into the strictest lockdown underscored the vastly different approach New Zealand has taken to the virus than most other nations, which are attempting to suppress its spread rather than eliminate it entirely.New Zealand has reported just 26 virus deaths since the pandemic began.The lockdown takes effect from just before midnight Tuesday. It requires people to remain at home and avoid others. Most people can leave only to buy groceries or exercise. The nation's vaccination program had been accelerating but has been suspended for two days due to the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-to-enter-lockdown-after-single-virus-case-found-101629199613006.html
17-08-2021||World||China launches integrated ‘assault drills’ near Taiwan||China deployed warships and fighter aircraft near self-ruled Taiwan on Tuesday in what it called “assault drills” against alleged provocations by Taiwanese secessionists supported by the US.The People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) eastern theatre command (ETC) said it dispatched anti-submarine aircraft, jets and battleships near the maritime and airspace of southwest and southeast of Taiwan to test the troops’ integrated joint operation capabilities.China claims self-ruled Taiwan and doesn’t rule out reunifying the island by force. It resents any official ties between Taipei and other countries, arguing that such relations violate the “one China” policy.Beijing believes Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has a separatist bent on a formal declaration of independence with the support of the US.Earlier this month, Beijing lashed out at Washington after it finalised the sale of 40 medium self-propelled howitzer artillery systems to Taiwan in a deal valued at $750 million.Beijing will take legitimate and necessary counter-measures in light of the development of the situation, the Chinese foreign ministry said.On Tuesday’s development, the PLA’s ETA said in a statement the deployment was carried out with “joint fire assault and other drills using actual troops”.“Recently, the US and Taiwan have repeatedly provoked and sent serious wrong signals, severely infringed upon China’s sovereignty and severely undermined the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait, which has become the biggest source of security risks across the Taiwan Strait,” the command spokesperson Shi Yi said.“This exercise is a necessary action based on the current security situation across the Taiwan Strait and the need to safeguard national sovereignty,” he added.Taiwan’s defence ministry, according to Reuters news agency, gave a short response, saying, “The nation’s military has a full grasp and has made a full assessment of the situation in the Taiwan Strait region, as well as related developments at sea and in the air, and is prepared for various responses.”Tuesday’s drills took place days after the ETC carried out combat exercises in the Taiwan Straits and surrounding waters to verify and boost its inter-service joint operation capability.Units from multiple services took part in the exercises in the straits, including their northern and southern ends, senior colonel Zhang Chunhui, the command’s spokesman, said in a statement published last week.China Daily quoted Zhang as saying that they were “a necessary move responding to the current security situation in the Taiwan Straits and were meant to safeguard national sovereignty”.The statement did not use a description often employed to describe such operations - “a routine exercise included in the PLA’s annual training plan”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-launches-integrated-assault-drills-near-taiwan-101629199474050.html

Steinmeier said Germany is duty-bound to "do everything it can to bring our people, and all Afghans who stood for years by their side, to safety".It will also extend help to those in Afghanistan who are at risk, including "many courageous women", said Steinmeier, who was previously foreign minister."The failure of the years-long efforts to build a stable and viable society in Afghanistan raises fundamental questions for the past and future of our foreign policy and military engagement," he said.Also read | Taliban were ‘catching and killing us’: Afghan intel officer who fled to Delhi on last flight from KabulGerman forces were deployed for almost two decades in Afghanistan as part of the US-led NATO operation.The 150,000 men and women sent by Germany at various points over the years made it the second biggest contributor of NATO troops there, after the United States.Germany withdrew its last troops at the end of June following Washington's decision to leave the country.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-temporarily-halts-development-aid-for-afghanistan-evacuation-continues-101629197989018.html

Another video, that went viral on social media, showed insurgents riding play horses in a merry-go-round and talking animatedly among themselves.It seems all they wanted was free rides at the theme park #Taliban pic.twitter.com/qh00uk96UKThe Taliban took control of the presidential palace in Kabul on Sunday hours after President Ashraf Ghani fled Afghanistan, reportedly for a central Asian nation, literally establishing its rule in the embattled country two decades after they were ousted by the US military.Monday's scenes from an amusement park in Kabul were in sharp and ironic contrast to chaotic visuals that surfaced from the city's international airport, where thousands of panic-stricken Afghans gathered in a desperate attempt to leave the country, even as the administration shut the civilian airspace over Afghanistan.Horrific videos widely circulated in media showed people running on the tarmac while some clung to the undercarriage of a US military aircraft as it taxied on the runway. Local media reported that at least three people fell to their death trying to escape as stowaways in a C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft of the US air force.ALSO READ | Taliban take control of Afghanistan: Why the country's army melted awayThe chaos at the runway, now under the control of the US troops, prompted a temporary halt in the evacuation process, only to resume early on Tuesday to ferry diplomats and civilians.Even as the Taliban said no one would be “harmed”, and declared an "amnesty" across the country, urging women to join their "government", thousands of people are desperate to flee the country as many Afghans were apprehensive of the Taliban rule and a return of the draconian practices. During the Taliban's previous rule between 1996 and 2001, women could not work and kangaroo courts meted out ‘punishments’ such as public stoning, whipping and hanging.On Monday, the UN Secretary-General António Guterres urged the Taliban to exercise utmost restraint to protect lives and called on the UN Security Council to use all tools at its disposal to suppress global terrorist threats in Afghanistan and ensure human rights are not violated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-taliban-armed-fighters-kabul-amusement-park-takeover-101629191931610.html
17-08-2021||World||Chinese ports choke over 'zero tolerance' Covid-19 policy||Several Chinese ports are facing congestion as vessels due to call at Ningbo are bing diverted and cargo processing is slowed partly due to stricter disinfection measures under China's "zero-tolerance" coronavirus policy.On Tuesday, more than 50 container vessels were queuing at Ningbo port, China's second largest marine centre, Refinitiv data showed, up from 28 on Aug. 10 when a Covid-19 case was reported at one of its terminals.Leading international shipping groups have warned their clients of delays and route adjustments. At least 14 vessels operated by CMA CGM, five Maersk vessels and four Hapag-Lloyd ships have decided to skip Ningbo, while dozens of vessels are adjusting their schedules, the shipping groups said.China's economy is losing momentum as a result of new coronavirus restrictions and global supply chains face further strains with the curbs adding to queues at major Chinese transportation hubs, already stretched by a resurgence of consumer spending, shortage of container ships and logjams at ports.China's Ministry of Transportation has ordered all ports to have special teams to deal with foreign vessels and required their crews to have health certificates or negative tests before allowing them to load and discharge cargos.Ports also have their own rules, with some applying additional precautions to vessels that stopped at ports in high-risk regions, such as India, Laos or Russia, in the past 21 days."China's zero tolerance policy is good for the pandemic but bad for the supply chain," said Dawn Tiura, chief executive officer of Sourcing Industry Group, a U.S.-based association for the sourcing and procurement industry. "This timing is very tough considering the uptick in back-to-school and return-to-work shopping in addition to the upcoming holiday shopping season."Ningbo Zhoushan Port Co said in a statement late on Monday its handling volume has resumed to about 90% of its average daily level in July, following efforts to mitigate the impact of the shutdown of a terminal, which accounts for about 20% of Ningbo's container handling capacity, after a COVID-19 case was detected there last week.Vessels scheduled to call at the terminal are being re-routed to nearby ports. Shanghai port had 34 vessels waiting at anchorage, compared to 27 on Aug. 10, while the number of vessels waiting at Xiamen port - 700 km south of Ningbo - rose to 18 on Tuesday from four early last week."Cargoes have been piling up at port recently due to tight labour force from portside and relevant departments, while increasing shipments also weighed," said a bulk ship operator at China's eastern port city Lianyungang."China is an important component of the global supply chain ... Any shutdowns or delays from China have the potential to delay finished goods two or three tiers out," said Richard Lebovitz, chief executive officer of LeanDNA, a U.S-based supply chain consultancy.The Freightos Baltic Global Container Index (FBX), a weighted average of 12 major global container routes, hit a record high of 9,770 per forty-foot equivalent (FEU) container this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-ports-choke-over-zero-tolerance-covid-19-policy-101629195935949.html

Addressing a news conference in Jordan’s capital Amman, Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu expressed hope that the Taliban would follow the message with their actions."We welcome the positive messages given by the Taliban to foreigners, diplomatic missions and their own population. I hope we will see (the same approach) in their actions," Cavusoglu said.The minister told the news conference that Turkey is in talks with all parties in Afghanistan, including the Taliban which took control of the war-torn nation by force as US-led foreign troops finalised their withdrawal. He added that Ankara would continue talks with the US and other allies over the security of Kabul airport and the transition of power in Afghanistan.In a desperate attempt to leave Afghanistan, thousands of people have been thronging Kabul airport, leading to a chaotic situation. On Monday, the United States said that it would deploy 6,000 of its troops to ensure the safe departure of its citizens and allies from Afghanistan. Turkey assured that evacuation flights would continue as the airport was secured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-welcomes-positive-messages-from-taliban-after-amnesty-announcement-101629190042892.html
17-08-2021||World||Taliban announces 'amnesty' across Afghanistan, urges women to join govt||The Taliban declared an “amnesty” across Afghanistan and urged women to join its government Tuesday, trying to calm nerves across a tense capital city that only the day before saw chaos at its airport as people tried to flee their rule.The comments by Enamullah Samangani, a member of the Taliban's cultural commission, represent the first comments on governance from a federal level across the country after their blitz across the country.While there were no major reports of abuses or fighting in Kabul, many residents have stayed home and remain fearful after the insurgents’ takeover saw prisons emptied and armories looted. Older generations remember their ultraconservative Islamic views, which included stonings, amputations and public executions during their rule before the US-led invasion that followed the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks.“The Islamic Emirate doesn't want women to be victims” Samangani said, using the militants' term for Afghanistan. “They should be in government structure according to Shariah law.”He added: “The structure of government is not fully clear, but based on experience, there should be a fully Islamic leadership and all sides should join.”Samangani remained vague on other details, however, implying people already knew the rules of Islamic law the Taliban expected them to follow."Our people are Muslims and we are not here to force them to Islam,” he said.Under the Taliban, which ruled in accordance with a harsh interpretation of Islamic law, women were largely confined to their homes. The insurgents have sought to project greater moderation in recent years, but many Afghans remain skeptical.Meanwhile Tuesday, Stefano Pontecorvo, NATO's senior civilian representative to Afghanistan, posted video online showing the runway empty with American troops on the tarmac. What appeared to be a military cargo plane could be seen in the distance from behind a chain-link fence in the footage.The runway "is open,” he wrote on Twitter. “I see airplanes landing and taking off.”Overnight, flight-tracking data showed a US Marine Corps KC-130J Hercules plane at the airport and later taking off for Qatar, home to Al-Udeid Air Base and the U.S. military Central Command's forward headquarters.The German Foreign Ministry meanwhile said a first German military transport plane has landed in Kabul, but it could only take seven people on board before it had to depart again.“Because of the chaotic conditions at the airport and regular exchanges of fire at the access point last night, it was not possible for further German citizens and other people who need to be evacuated to come to the airport without protection from the German army," the ministry said.A special military flight with some 120 Indian officials separately landed in the western state of Gujarat after taking off from Kabul’s main airport on Tuesday, the Press Trust of India and state TV reported. Another flight made it off the ground Monday as well.Sweden’ s Foreign Minister Ann Linde wrote on Twitter on Tuesday that the staff from the Swedish Embassy in Kabul had returned to Sweden.On Monday, thousands of Afghans rushed into Kabul’s main airport, some so desperate to escape the Taliban that they held onto a military jet as it took off and plunged to their deaths. At least seven people died in the chaos, US officials saidAcross Afghanistan, the International Committee of the Red Cross said thousands had been wounded in the fighting. Security forces and politicians handed over their provinces and bases without a fight, likely believing the two-decade Western experiment to remake Afghanistan would not survive the resurgent Taliban. The last American troops had planned to withdraw at the end of the month.“The world is following events in Afghanistan with a heavy heart and deep disquiet about what lies ahead,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said.A resolute US President Joe Biden on Monday said he stood “squarely behind” his decision to withdraw American forces and acknowledged the “gut-wrenching” images unfolding in Kabul. Biden said he faced a choice between honoring a previously negotiated withdrawal agreement or sending thousands more troops back to begin a third decade of war.“After 20 years, I’ve learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw US forces,” Biden said in a televised address from the White House.Talks appeared to be continuing between the Taliban and several Afghan government officials, including former President Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, who once headed the country’s negotiating council. President Ashraf Ghani earlier fled the country amid the Taliban advance and his whereabouts remain unknown.An official with direct knowledge of the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity as he wasn't authorized to brief journalists, said senior Taliban leader Amir Khan Muttaqi had arrived in Kabul from Qatar. Muttaqi is a former higher education minister during the Taliban's last rule. Muttaqi had begun making contact with Afghan political leaders even before Ghani fled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-announces-amnesty-across-afghanistan-urges-women-to-join-govt-101629188080377.html

The police have detained the man who carried out the act.This is the third time that the Maharaja's statue, located in high security Lahore Fort complex, has been vandalised.Watch video below:The nine-feet statue, made of cold bronze, was unveiled at the Lahore Fort in June 2019 to mark the 180th death anniversary of the Maharaja. Singh, the first Maharaja of the Sikh Empire, ruled over Punjab for close to 40 years. He died in 1839.The statue shows the regal Maharaja Ranjit Singh sitting on a horse, sword in hand, complete in Sikh attire.Just two months after its unveiling, the statue was vandalised by two members of Tehreek-e-Labbaik. Both the men were arrested by the police. They entered the fort as a disabled person and his helper. The man who pretended to have a leg disability hit the statue with the rod he was carrying while the second person helped him. One of the arms of the statue and other parts were broken in the attack.The police said that the attackers were of the view that it's against their religion to erect a statue of a Sikh ruler in a Muslim country.It took eight months to complete the statue of the Sikh ruler sitting on his favourite horse named Kahar Bahar with a sword in hand. The horse was a gift from Dost Muhammad Khan, the founder of the Barazkai dynasty.The statue was built and installed by the Walled City of Lahore Authority (WCLA) in collaboration with the UK-based Sikh Heritage Foundation, which funded the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maharaja-ranjit-singh-s-statue-vandalised-in-pakistan-1-detained-101629185755329.html

17-08-2021||World||Khairullah Khairkhwa, part of 'Gitmo 5' released in 2014, planned Taliban's return: Report||A Taliban prisoner who was released from the Guantanamo Bay prison in 2014 by former US president Barack Obama, is emerging as the key figure who reunited the insurgents and helped them capture the power in Afghanistan. Khairullah Khairkhwa was released along with four others in exchange for captured US Army soldier, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.Others released along with Khairkhwa were Mohammed Nabi, who served as chief of security for the Taliban in Qalat; Mohammad Fazl, who according to Human Rights Watch allegedly presided over the mass killing of Shiite Muslims in Afghanistan in 2000 and 2001; Abdul Haq Wasiq, who served as the Taliban deputy minister of intelligence and Mullah Norullah Nori, who was a senior Taliban commander in Mazar-e-Sharif in 2001.Also Read: Afghan war cost US $2 trillion, interest will pinch every AmericanThe 'Gitmo Five' were labelled "hardest of the hardcore" by US intelligence officials who urged Obama to reconsider his decision. However, those warnings were ignored, with assurance that these five terrorists will be kept in Qatar, so that they are not able to indulge in active politics in Afghanistan.But now, a report the New York Post has claimed that Khairkhwa and the four others released along with him made contact with active Taliban terrorists and vowed to drive American troops out of the country which they ruled 20 years ago. Khairkhwa played a key role in formation of a Taliban regime in exile and became official negotiator for peace talks, the Post report said.In the negotiations that followed with the western countries, Khairkhwa discussed the terms with US President Joe Biden's envoy to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, at a conference in Moscow. However, the team refused to promise they would not launch a spring offensive despite calls from the United States, Russia and China.Al Jazeera has now quoted Taliban fighters to report that Khairkhwa, along with the other members of its regime in exile, will be brought back to Afghanistan.Washington has been at war in Afghanistan for nearly two decades, since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks masterminded by al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden who was based in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. The invasion toppled the Taliban regime, but they never left.As soon as the withdrawal of US forces was announced, the Taliban stepped up their efforts to capture Afghanistan and launched an offensive against the western-trained forces. They started capturing territories at a stunning pace, and completely seized power in Afghanistan on Sunday - two weeks before the US was set to complete its troop withdrawal.President Biden acknowledged on Monday that the collapse of the Afghan government occurred much faster than his administration expected.The president said in remarks at the White House, “The truth is this did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated.” Yet, the president said that the rapid end of the Afghan government only vindicates his choice to end the war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-khairullah-khairkhwa-released-from-guantanamo-bay-planned-taliban-s-return-101629182398683.html

Five years later, the General Assembly adopted a resolution designating August 19 as World Humanitarian Day.Every year, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs decides on a theme to encourage people to raise awareness about a prevailing crisis. This year, the world body is focussing on the climate crisis and its immediate human cost. With this, it aims to increase pressure on world leaders to take meaningful steps against climate change and save the world’s most vulnerable people."With most climate campaigns focused on slowing climate change and securing the planet’s future, World Humanitarian Day 2021 will highlight the immediate human cost of the climate crisis and pressure world leaders to take meaningful climate action for the world’s most vulnerable people," the UN said in the statement on its website.The UN also highlighted that the climate emergency is wreaking havoc across the world at a scale that the humanitarian community and people working at the forefront of the issue cannot manage.

17-08-2021||World||Can't forgive him: Afghan central bank chief blames Ghani for chaos, flees Kabul||The head of Afghanistan's central bank has fled Kabul, questioned the loyalty of Afghan security forces and blamed President Ashraf Ghani and his inexperienced advisors for the country's swift and chaotic fall to the Taliban.In a Twitter thread on Monday detailing how he worked at the bank until militants were at the gates of the city, Acting Governor Ajmal Ahmady also said that US dollar supplies were dwindling and described escaping the capital on a military flight."On Sunday I began work. Reports throughout morning were increasingly worrisome. I left the bank and left deputies in charge. Felt terrible about leaving staff," he said."It did not have to end this way. I am disgusted by the lack of any planning by Afghan leadership. Saw at airport them leave without informing others,"Ghani fled Afghanistan on Sunday as Taliban militants entered Kabul virtually unopposed.Their arrival, barely a week after they captured faraway provincial capital Zaranj, was disorienting, said Ahmady, 43.He was appointed acting governor of Afghanistan's central bank just over a year ago, having previously worked at the US Treasury, the World Bank and in private equity, according to a short biography posted on a government website."Seems difficult to believe, but there remains a suspicion as to why (Afghan National Security Forces) left posts so quickly," Ahmady said, referring to claims by some pro-government militia leaders of that the army's capitulation in northern Afghanistan was the result of a conspiracy."There is something left unexplained."Ahmady did not respond to Reuters' emails and messages seeking comment. His remarks were posted from his verified Twitter account. A World Bank source who has been in correspondence with Ahmady said the account was genuine.As the Taliban advanced, Ahmady said Afghanistan's currency markets were in a panic, especially after the central bank on Friday was told it would not receive any more dollars, driving the price of Afghanistan's currency, the Afghani, sharply lower."I held meetings on Saturday to reassure banks and money exchangers to calm them down. I can't believe that was one day before Kabul fell," Ahmady said. He said the currency dropped as far as 100 to the dollar, a fall of about 23%, before stabilising at 86.Ahmady said he boarded a military aircraft amid chaos on the tarmac after a commercial flight he booked was swamped with passengers. It was unclear which military plane he boarded and he did not mention his destination."There was a rush. Some shots were fired. Somehow, my close colleagues pushed me on board," he said. Ghani's lack of planning and failure to recognise the shortcomings of his advisers were the government's undoing, Ahmady said."Once president’s departure was announced, I knew within minutes chaos would follow. I cannot forgive him for creating that without a transition plan."He himself had great ideas but poor execution. If I contributed to that, I take my share of the blame."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cant-forgive-him-afghan-central-bank-chief-blames-ghani-for-chaos-flees-kabul-101629181690641.html
17-08-2021||World||Afghan war cost US $2 trillion, interest will pinch every American||Afghanistan is now under the control of Taliban. And it took them just a month to defeat the Western-backed forces of Afghanistan and take control of the country again after 20 years.The turnaround happened in the wake of the pullout of United States forces from Afghanistan - its longest combat mission till date. The US forces remained in Afghanistan for about two decades - since 9/11 - and have spent trillions of dollars but all that came to naught in front of Taliban blitzkrieg.And because the US borrowed most of the money to pay for it, generations of Americans will be burdened by the cost of paying it off.Take a look at US-led war in Afghanistan, by the numbers:According to estimates by Costs of War Project at Brown University, United States has spent more than $2 trillion on the war in Afghanistan. This includes the direct funding cost of $800 billion and $83 billion to train the Afghan army.To put the figures in perspective, the amount spent in keeping Taliban at bay is more than the combined net worth of Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Bill Gates and the 30 richest billionaires in America.The Brown University has also made the projection that the cost of interest on the United States' Afghan war debt will go up to $6.5 trillion by 2050. And that will pinch the average American, since it translates to $20,000 for each and every US citizen.The cost is even greater in terms of lives lost. The US lost 2,448 of its service members (figures till April this year) while fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan, and nearly 4,000 civilian contractors. More than 66,000 Afghan national military and police personnel have also been killed in the last 20 years.The civilian cost too is very high - 47,245. The number of Taliban and other opposition fighters killed in the war stands at 51,191, according to university figures.The US has also committed a substantial amount in health care, disability, burial and other costs for roughly 4 million Afghanistan and Iraq veterans. That amount will peak after 2048.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-war-cost-us-2-trillion-interest-will-pinch-every-american-101629179737345.html

The group took advantage of the troops' pullout from the country by the United States and Nato, and the meltdown by the Afghan forces and its government. On Sunday, the group captured the capital city of Kabul and entered the presidential palace even as President Ashraf Ghan fled the country.As panic gripped the country, residents, fearing a repeat of the Taliban's brutal Islamist rule from 1996 to 2001, thronged the Kabul airport in a desperate attempt to escape. On Monday, thousands of Afghans stormed into the Hamid Karzai International Airport and some even clung onto the planes. At least two people lost their lives as they lost their grip and fell afterthe plane took off.Here are the latest developments of the crisis:Situation in KabulA day after the chaotic scenes at the Kabul airport, the number of civilians had thinned out, news agency Reuters reported quoting a security official at the facility. Military flights evacuating diplomats and civilians from Afghanistan have also been resumed early on Tuesday after the runway was cleared of the crowd.Occasional shots are also being heard from the direction of the airport, while other streets of the city remained mostly calm as against the panic and confusion scenes of yesterday.Defiant BidenUS President Joe Biden who is facing flak for abandoning Afghanistan and sparking a major humanitarian crisis in the country rejected blame for the chaos and said, "I stand squarely behind my decision."Biden also acknowledged the Afghan collapse played out far more quickly than the most forecasts of his administration. “This did unfold more quickly than we anticipated," he said in a statement from the White House.The president further placed the blame on Afghan and said he warned Ghani — who was appointed Afghanistan's president in a US-negotiated agreement — to be prepared to fight a civil war with the Taliban after American forces leave the country. "They failed to do any of that," Biden also said.EvacuationsThe US has evacuated its embassy and most of the staff. It is now working to evacuate the rest of the citizens and Afghan staff that was working for them for years.India is also evacuating its diplomats and other staff in the Indian Air Force's C17 aircraft. Indian ambassador to Afghanistan Rudrendra Tandon is on the flight along with 120 other diplomats and officials who were evacuated on Tuesday.The Indian government has also announced a provision of electronic visas to fast-track applications for those who wish to leave Afghanistan and want to come to Pakistan. The government launched "e-Emergency X-Misc Visa" on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabul-streets-turn-silent-a-day-after-chaos-evacuations-continue-101629179380891.html
17-08-2021||World||Taliban seizure of Kabul sparks frenetic global diplomacy||With Pakistan-backed ultra-conservative Taliban seizing Kabul by force on August 15, there is frenetic diplomacy among major powers with US secretary of state Antony Blinken talking to his Chinese and Russian counterparts to find a way forward to stem the present chaos in Afghanistan. It is quite evident that China and Russia have cut a deal with the Taliban in exchange for recognition as the legitimate ruler of Afghanistan. The two powers apparently cut a deal with the help of Pakistan on the assurance that there will be no support for Uighur militants in Afghanistan and no intrusion or Taliban jihad into Central Asian republics bordering Afghanistan.However, the Taliban victory will not be complete till such time Ahmad Shah Massoud's son, Ahmad Massoud, and formidable former Afghan VP Amrulleh Saleh are building resistance in Panjshir Valley. Panjshir Valley that links Afghanistan to Xinjiang via the Wakhan corridor has never been occupied by either the invading Soviets in the 1970s or the Taliban in the 1990s.Blinken also spoke on Monday with counterparts in India, Pakistan, Russia, Britain, the European Union, Turkey and Nato about ensuring regional stability, the State Department said.Also read | EXCLUSIVE: India evacuates second batch of diplomats, officials from AfghanistanChinese foreign minister Wang Yi told Blinken that the hasty pullout of American troops had a "serious negative impact", China's state broadcaster CCTV reported, adding that Wang pledged to work with Washington to promote stability.As there was panic and confusion in Kabul, US President Joe Biden defended his country's decision to withdraw American forces after 20 years of war. Biden insisted he had to decide between asking US forces to fight endlessly in what he called Afghanistan's civil war or follow through on an agreement to depart negotiated by Republican former president Donald Trump."I stand squarely behind my decision. After 20 years I have learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw US forces. That's why we're still there," Biden, who has been facing a barrage of criticism, said. He also blamed the Taliban's takeover on Afghan political leaders who fled the country and the Afghan army's unwillingness to fight.Also read | Taliban take control of Afghanistan: Why the country's army melted awayAfter a day of chaos at Kabul airport, military flights evacuating diplomats and civilians from Afghanistan restarted early on Tuesday after the runway at Kabul airport was cleared of thousands of people desperate to flee after the Taliban seized the capital. Ten Afghan civilians have been killed so far at the Kabul airport amid the ensuing chaos, but it was not clear whether they had been shot or crushed in a stampede. Meanwhile, several reports indicated that there is no aviation fuel left at the Airport.Also watch | Akhundzada, Haqqani, Baradar: Meet the Taliban leaders running AfghanistanThe Taliban are also holding internal consultations on formulating new governance set up in Afghanistan.

He was also a member of a famous South Korean pop band before returning to China a few years ago.The prosecutor’s office of the Beijing district of Chaoyang was quoted in the Chinese state media as saying in a statement that Wu’s arrest was formally approved on Monday.The court gave no details of the charges or the sentencing.Chinese state media has said that Wu, whose Chinese name is Wu Yifan, could be jailed for 10 years. In China, rape usually carries a sentence between three to 10 years of imprisonment.Wu grew up in Guangzhou in south China and in Vancouver, Canada. Police have said he is a Canadian citizen.Wu, one of China’s biggest stars, faces a series of sexual abuse accusations from a 19-year-old student identified as Du Meizhu.Wu, 30, had earlier denied the accusation by a teenager that he had sex with her while she was drunk.Du’s allegations emerged in July on Chinese social media platform Weibo, when she alleged that Wu had sexually assaulted her while she was drunk at his home where she said she had gone for a casting interview.Du said she was 17 at the time. In China, the age of consent is 14.“Du previously revealed to the media that Wu used various methods to identify and lure young girls for sex. Du claimed that the number of victims, including herself, far exceeds eight, among whom two are minors,” The Global Times reported, quoting Du.Du said that she had returned Wu the hush money, about 500,000 yuan ($77,166), in installments and was ready to go through legal procedures, the report said.Global luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton, Porsche and several Chinese ones severed ties with Wu soon after the allegations emerged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prominent-chinese-canadian-pop-star-kris-wu-arrested-for-allegedly-raping-teen-101629177751779.html
17-08-2021||World||Malaysia's king to meet political leaders to find new PM||Malaysia’s king is set Tuesday to meet the heads of political parties as he swiftly began the task of finding a new prime minister amid a worsening coronavirus pandemic.The resignation Monday of Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin after less than 18 months in office followed mounting public anger over what was widely perceived as his government’s poor handling of the pandemic. Malaysia has one of the world’s highest infection rates and deaths per capita, with daily cases breaching 20,000 this month despite a seven-month state of emergency and a lockdown since June.The monarch has ruled out a general election as many parts of the country are Covid-19 red zones and health facilities are inadequate.Muhyiddin was appointed caretaker prime minister until a successor is found.Local media said Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah has summoned party leaders to the palace later Tuesday, all believed to be at the same time. This included parties formerly in Muhyiddin’s government as well as the opposition.The king plays a largely ceremonial role but he appoints the person he believes has majority support of Parliament to be prime minister.Muhyiddin took power in March 2020 after initiating the collapse of the reformist government that won 2018 elections. With a razor-thin majority in Parliament and an unstable coalition, he held office less than 18 months, making him the country’s shortest-ruling leader.Before choosing Muhyiddin, Sultan Abdullah interviewed all 222 lawmakers individually then sought nominations from party leaders in an arduous selection process. His choice of Muhyiddin as the prime minister was disputed by the predecessor he ousted, Mahathir Mohamad, and the opposition.An official from Mahathir's party confirmed it has been invited to the meeting Tuesday.The selection this time will be another tough chore for the monarch because no coalition can claim a majority. The three-party alliance that is the biggest opposition bloc has nominated its leader, Anwar Ibrahim. But the bloc has less than 90 lawmakers, short of the 111 needed for a simple majority. That’s also less than the 100 lawmakers believed to have backed Muhyiddin.Other contenders include former Deputy Prime Minister Ismail who is from the United Malays National Organization, the biggest party in Muhyiddin’s alliance.Local media said another possible candidate is Razaleigh Hamzah, an 84-year-old prince who was a former finance minister. Razaleigh, an UMNO lawmaker, is seen as a neutral candidate who could unite the warring factions in UMNO.A leader from eastern Sabah state on Borneo island, Shafie Apdal, has also been named in the race. It is unlikely as his party only has 8 lawmakers but some say a leader from Borneo may be seen as acceptable to all.But Mahathir, 96, has called for a national recovery council to be formed and led mainly by professionals to resolve the country’s economic and health crises.The Bersih electoral reform group urged contenders to pursue political stability by offering multi-partisan governance and institutional reforms, and not just horse-trading over numbers and positions.“The endless political machination due to winner-takes-all politics in a de facto hung parliament for the past one and a half year must now end to enable a more effective governance of health and economy. The new Prime Minister must quickly convene a special meeting and table a motion of confidence in himself to prove his majority,” it said in a statement.It warned that a short-sighted and self-serving government would be punished by voters in the next election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysias-king-to-meet-political-leaders-to-find-new-pm-101629176913107.html
17-08-2021||World||Taliban take control of Afghanistan: Why the country's army melted away||Afghanistan has been plunged into chaos after Taliban took over in the wake of pullout of American forces from the country. While Afghans living outside the country are angry at world community for "abandoning" them, much of that anger is directed towards the United States.EXCLUSIVE: India evacuates second batch of diplomats, officials from AfghanistanThe Biden administration has been accused by many, like former US ambassador to Afghanistan Ronald Neumann, of giving a "profound shock" to the Afghan army and morale by pulling out. Many Afghans were seen clinging to US military planes in Kabul on Monday in a desperate bid to flee their home country after the Taliban's easy victory over an Afghan military.Akhundzada, Haqqani, Baradar: Meet the Taliban leaders running AfghanistanAmerica and Nato allies had spent two decades trying to build the army, but it easily melted away. Here's a look at what really went wrong:Dollars down the drainWashington spent $83 billion to create a modern army. It meant huge dependence on high-tech communications where 30% of the population can count on reliable power supply. The Afghans, many of them illiterate in a country lacking infrastructure to support cutting-edge military equipment, failed to mount a resistance against an outnumbered foe.Inflated numbersFor months on end, the Pentagon had said there was a numerical advantage held by the Afghan forces - supposedly with 300,000 men in the army and the police - over the Taliban, estimated to number some 70,000. But those army numbers were inflated.As of July 2020, the 300,000 included only 1,85,000 troops or special operations forces, with police and other security personnel making up the rest. And barely 60 per cent of the troops were trained fighters.Unpaid and unfedThe salaries of the Afghan army were paid for years by the Pentagon. But from the time the US army announced its withdrawal, responsibility for payments fell on the Kabul government. Afghan soldiers complained they not only were unpaid for months, in many instances, their units were no longer getting food supplies and ammunition.Illusory promisesUS officials have vowed they will support the Afghan national army after August 31 - the date for completing the withdrawal of American forces - but they have never explained how this would be done. In May, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said help would be provided from afar through "over the horizon" logistics. That vague concept implied the use of virtual training sessions with video conferencing on the Zoom platform - an approach that seems illusory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-take-control-of-afghanistan-why-the-country-s-army-melted-away-101629176790783.html

The state of emergency could be extended till September 12, according to officials.The emergency measures have already been imposed in Tokyo, Osaka, Okinawa and three other regions and were supposed to end by August 31. And now, the number of regions under restrictions has climbed to 13.The above measures include banning restaurants and bars from selling alcohol and instructing them to close at 8pm. The government is also expected to ask shopping malls and departmental stores to limit the number of customers inside their premises at one point in time.“(Infection) is spreading across Japan on a scale we have never experienced before,” Yasutoshi Nishimura, Japan’s Covid-19 response minister, told an expert panel on Tuesday, adding the number of critical patients is rising with each passing day.Even though Japan has a smaller Covid-19 outbreak compared to other countries, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga-led government is finding it difficult to curb the spread of the viral disease fuelled by the Delta variant.According to news agency Bloomberg, the emergency measures are having very little effect on citizens. Despite the threat of fines, bars and restaurants are not closing on time and are still selling alcohol. People are stepping out of their homes unnecessarily and no penalties have been imposed by government authorities yet.Prime Minister Suga has ruled out the possibility of a mandatory lockdown and said he is relying on the vaccination rollout to improve the situation. Bloomberg further reported that a little over 37 per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated till Monday and the government is planning to administer vaccines to all those citizens who want it by November.Japan recently concluded the 2020 Olympics in the capital city of Tokyo amid the pandemic, considered by many as the most challenging Olympic journey. All events were held in a restricted manner in empty venues which only had athletes, team officials and journalists.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-expand-covid-state-of-emergency-to-7-more-regions-amid-spike-in-cases-101629170629118.html

The quake nearly wrecked some towns in the southwest in the latest disaster to befall the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation.Haitians already were struggling with the coronavirus pandemic, gang violence, worsening poverty and the July 7 assassination of President Jovenel Moise.What makes Haiti prone to quakes?Earthquakes occur when tectonic plates in the Earth's crust move. Haiti sits near the intersection of two of them - the North American plate and the Caribbean plate.Officials said the magnitude 7.2 earthquake left more than 7,000 homes destroyed and nearly 5,000 damaged. Some 30,000 families have been left homeless.The buildings in the country are designed to withstand hurricanes, not earthquakes.What was the epicentre of Saturday's earthquake?The quake that hit Haiti was centred 125km west of the capital Port-au-Prince. Hospitals, schools, offices and churches were destroyed or badly damaged.This year's quake was stronger than the one that hit the country in 2010, but hit a less densely populated area.PM declares emergencyHaiti's Prime Minister Ariel Henry declared a one-month state of emergency for the whole country and said the first government aid convoys had started moving help to areas where towns were destroyed and hospitals were overwhelmed."We must work together to provide rapid and effective responses to this extremely serious situation," Henry said on Sunday.UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said humanitarian needs were acute, with many Haitians urgently needing healthcare, clean water and shelter. Children separated from their parents also needed protection, she said.The 2010 earthquakeHaiti was struck by a 7.0 earthquake in January, 2010, which left more than 2,00,000 dead and Port-au-Prince and nearby cities in ruins.More than 1.5 million Haitians were made homeless and 60 per cent of the country's healthcare system was destroyed.In 2010, it had been more than a century since the last major earthquake had struck.

17-08-2021||World||Billions spent by US on Afghan army ultimately benefited Taliban||Built and trained at a two-decade cost of $83 billion, Afghan security forces collapsed so quickly and completely — in some cases without a shot fired — that the ultimate beneficiary of the American investment turned out to be the Taliban. They grabbed not only political power but also US-supplied firepower — guns, ammunition, helicopters and more.The Taliban captured an array of modern military equipment when they overran Afghan forces who failed to defend district centers. Bigger gains followed, including combat aircraft, when the Taliban rolled up provincial capitals and military bases with stunning speed, topped by capturing the biggest prize, Kabul, over the weekend.A US defence official on Monday confirmed the Taliban's sudden accumulation of US-supplied Afghan equipment is enormous. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and so spoke on condition of anonymity. The reversal is an embarrassing consequence of misjudging the viability of Afghan government forces — by the US military as well as intelligence agencies — which in some cases chose to surrender their vehicles and weapons rather than fight.The US failure to produce a sustainable Afghan army and police force, and the reasons for their collapse, will be studied for years by military analysts. The basic dimensions, however, are clear and are not unlike what happened in Iraq. The forces turned out to be hollow, equipped with superior arms but largely missing the crucial ingredient of combat motivation.“Money can't buy will. You cannot purchase leadership,” John Kirby, chief spokesman for Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, said Monday.Doug Lute, a retired Army lieutenant general who help direct Afghan war strategy during the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations, said that what the Afghans received in tangible resources they lacked in the more important intangibles.“The principle of war stands — moral factors dominate material factors,” he said. “Morale, discipline, leadership, unit cohesion are more decisive than numbers of forces and equipment. As outsiders in Afghanistan, we can provide materiel, but only Afghans can provide the intangible moral factors.”By contrast, Afghanistan's Taliban insurgents, with smaller numbers, less sophisticated weaponry and no air power, proved a superior force. US intelligence agencies largely underestimated the scope of that superiority, and even after President Joe Biden announced in April he was withdrawing all US troops, the intelligence agencies did not foresee a Taliban final offensive that would succeed so spectacularly.“If we wouldn’t have used hope as a course of action, ... we would have realised the rapid drawdown of US forces sent a signal to the Afghan national forces that they were being abandoned,” said Chris Miller, who saw combat in Afghanistan in 2001 and was acting secretary of defence at the end of President Donald Trump’s term.Stephen Biddle, a professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University and a former adviser to US commanders in Afghanistan, said Biden's announcement set the final collapse in motion.“The problem of the US withdrawal is that it sent a nationwide signal that the jig is up — a sudden, nationwide signal that everyone read the same way,” Biddle said. Before April, the Afghan government troops were slowly but steadily losing the war, he said. When they learned that their American partners were going home, an impulse to give up without a fight “spread like wildfire.”The failures, however, go back much further and run much deeper. The United States tried to develop a credible Afghan defense establishment on the fly, even as it was fighting the Taliban, attempting to widen the political foundations of the government in Kabul and seeking to establish democracy in a country rife with corruption and cronyism.Year after year, US military leaders downplayed the problems and insisted success was coming. Others saw the handwriting on the wall. In 2015 a professor at the Army War College's Strategic Studies Institute wrote about the military's failure to learn lessons from past wars; he subtitled his book, “Why the Afghan National Security Forces Will Not Hold.”“Regarding the future of Afghanistan, in blunt terms, the United States has been down this road at the strategic level twice before, in Vietnam and Iraq, and there is no viable rationale for why the results will be any different in Afghanistan,” Chris Mason wrote. He added, presciently: “Slow decay is inevitable, and state failure is a matter of time.”Some elements of the Afghan army did fight hard, including commandos whose heroic efforts are yet to be fully documented. But as a whole the security forces created by the United States and its NATO allies amounted to a “house of cards” whose collapse was driven as much by failures of US civilian leaders as their military partners, according to Anthony Cordesman, a longtime Afghanistan war analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.The Afghan force-building exercise was so completely dependent on American largesse that the Pentagon even paid the Afghan troops' salaries. Too often that money, and untold amounts of fuel, were siphoned off by corrupt officers and government overseers who cooked the books, creating “ghost soldiers” to keep the misspent dollars coming.Of the approximately $145 billion the US government spent trying to rebuild Afghanistan, about $83 billion went to developing and sustaining its army and police forces, according to the Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a congressionally created watchdog that has tracked the war since 2008. The $145 billion is in addition to $837 billion the United States spent fighting the war, which began with an invasion in October 2001.The $83 billion invested in Afghan forces over 20 years is nearly double last year's budget for the entire US Marine Corps and is slightly more than what Washington budgeted last year for food stamp assistance for about 40 million Americans.In his book, “The Afghanistan Papers,” journalist Craig Whitlock wrote that US trainers tried to force Western ways on Afghan recruits and gave scant thought to whether US taxpayers dollars were investing in a truly viable army.“Given that the US war strategy depended on the Afghan army's performance, however, the Pentagon paid surprisingly little attention to the question of whether Afghans were willing to die for their government,” he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/billions-spent-by-us-on-afghan-army-ultimately-benefited-taliban-101629174326895.html
17-08-2021||World||Panic grips Afghanistan as Taliban seizes control: What's next for the country||Afghanistan is in a state of disarray as the Taliban seized control of the country at a lightning speed following the pullout of troops by the United States and Nato. Within weeks, the Taliban swept from province to province until the group reached the presidential palace on Sunday, seizing power in the war-torn country.The stunning military takeover has triggered a massive panic across the capital with thousands of Afghans swarming to the airport in a desperate attempt to flee the country, fearing a repeat of the Taliban's brutal Islamist rule from 1996 to 2001.On Monday, dramatic footage posted on social media showed hundreds of men running alongside a US air force plane as it rolled down the runway, with some clinging to the side of it. In other videos, civilians frantically clambered up an already overcrowded and buckling jetway.President Ashraf Ghani fled as the Taliban reached Kabul on Sunday. Ghani left Afghanistan with the chief of staff, national security advisor and his family, as many on social media called him a coward and said they felt betrayed. However, Ghani said that he left to avoid further "bloodshed" in Afghanistan. As of now, it's not clear where he went.What is next for the war-torn country?The US and international community are piling pressure on the Taliban to reach some kind of deal with the Afghan government. This will likely lead to Ghani stepping down from his post or he will be moved to a figurehead role.The Taliban now control most of Afghanistan’s border crossings, which denies revenue for the government and enables the Taliban to tax trade to fund their fighting.The Taliban might also permit groups like al Qaeda to train and operate from there, which is likely to make the country hotbed of terrorist activities.Controlling the customs posts and border crossings (aside from Kabul airport) and with the Afghan military collapsing, the Taliban hold the cards. Russia and China will be comfortable engaging with the group’s leaders, according to experts.An exodus of people from Afghanistan could include terrorists and Uyghur separatists, worrying the neighbouring countries including Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan on the northern side.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/panic-grips-afghanistan-as-taliban-seizes-control-what-s-next-for-the-country-101629172652664.html
17-08-2021||World||Biden defends Afghan pull-out: ‘There was never a good time to withdraw forces’||US President Joe Biden on Monday defended his decision to pull his troops out of Afghanistan in the face of escalating criticism fuelled by heart-wrenching scenes of Afghan civilians trying to flee the country.“I stand squarely behind my decision. After 20 years, I’ve learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw US forces,” Biden said in an address to the nation from the White House on Monday in a brief return from vacation at the presidential retreat in the state of Maryland.Biden sought to explain the chaotic scenes and the speed of the Taliban takeover, which he admitted happened “more quickly than we had anticipated”.“So what’s happened? Afghanistan’s political leaders gave up and fled the country. The Afghan military collapsed, sometimes without trying to fight,” Biden said. “American troops cannot and should not be fighting in a war and dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves.”The American president has faced intense criticism in recent days as the Taliban rapidly took over Afghanistan emboldened by the withdrawal of US troops and precipitated a sense of desperation among Americans, allies and Afghan partners.Biden admitted being saddened by the events that have followed since, but, he said, “I do not regret my decision to end America’s war-fighting in Afghanistan.”Experts said the part of Biden’s speech that laid out his reasons for withdrawing from Afghanistan seemed familiar, as he has been vocal about it for years. In a nearly 19-minute speech from the East Room of the White House, Biden laid out his reasons, once again, for withdrawing American troops from Afghanistan, saying he has believed for long that the mission should have been to get the perpetrators of the 9/11 terror attacks and to let them never again use Afghanistan to launch another attack on the United States.The US president, who earlier sought to deflect blame for the Afghan debacle on the deal he inherited from former president Donald Trump, was scathing in his attack on Afghanistan’s leaders and the government forces.“We gave them every tool they could need. We paid their salaries, provided for the maintenance of their air force - something the Taliban doesn’t have,” the US president said as he defended his position. “When I hosted President [Ashraf] Ghani and chairman Abdullah [Abdullah] at the White House in June and again when I spoke by phone to Ghani in July, we had very frank conversations,” Biden said. “We talked about how Afghanistan should prepare to fight their civil wars after the US military departed, to clean up the corruption in government so the government could function for the Afghan people. We talked extensively about the need for Afghan leaders to unite politically.”“They failed to do any of that,” Biden said, and proceeded to further attack Afghan partners. “I also urged them to engage in diplomacy, to seek a political settlement with the Taliban. This advice was flatly refused. Mr. Ghani insisted the Afghan forces would fight, but obviously he was wrong.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-defends-afghan-pull-out-there-was-never-a-good-time-to-withdraw-forces-101629173071299.html

He was 69.A university dropout who worked in a printing company before founding Japan's first puzzle magazine, Kaji took hints from an existing number puzzle to create what he later named "sudoku" - a contraction of the Japanese for "every number must be single" - sometime in the mid-80s.The logic puzzle challenges people to fill a grid of 9X9 blocks, with nine boxes in each block so that all columns, both vertical and horizontal, contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition. The number of filled-in figures for a grid at the start of the puzzle determines how difficult it is."Known as the Godfather of Sudoku, he was adored by puzzle lovers around the world and we would like to express our gratitude to all of you," his company, Nikoli, said on its website on Monday.The cause of death was bile duct cancer.Sudoku became popular outside Japan around two decades ago after overseas newspapers began printing it. Praised as a way to keep mental faculties sharp, more than 100 million people around the world are estimated to try the puzzles regularly. A world championship has been held annually since 2006.Kaji continued to create and refine puzzles with the help of readers of his quarterly puzzle magazine. He stepped down as head of his company in July due to ill health and died on Aug. 10."I get really moved when I see a new idea for a puzzle which has lots of potential," he told the BBC in 2007, adding that the secret to inventing a good puzzle was to make the rules simple."It is like finding treasure. It's not about whether it will make money, it is purely the excitement of trying to solve it."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maki-kaji-the-godfather-of-sudoku-dies-at-69-101629166992978.html

"The situation is peaceful and good and everything has calmed down in the city. The situation in Kabul now under the Taliban is better than it was under (President) Ashraf Ghani," Zhirnov said while speaking to Moscow's Ekho Moskvy radio station, according to Reuters."Yesterday the regime fell like a house of cards. There was a feeling of disorder, a power vacuum, and looters came out on the streets," Zhirnov said, reported Reuters. Ghani fled on Sunday as the Taliban seized control of the country with lightning speed stunning countries across the world. The Afghan president said he left the country as he wanted to prevent bloodshed. There is no official confirmation of his whereabouts.Also read | India sets up Afghanistan cell to coordinate repatriation amid chaos in KabulRussia’s state news agency RIA Novosti reported that the Russian embassy in Kabul alleged on Monday that Ghani fled from Kabul with four cars and a helicopter full of cash. "The collapse of the regime ... is most eloquently characterised by how Ghani escaped from Afghanistan: four cars were filled with money, they tried to shove another part of the money into a helicopter, but not everything fit. And some of the money was left lying on the tarmac,” embassy spokesman Nikita Ishchenko was quoted saying in the report.Also watch: Joe Biden defends US exit from Afghanistan amid Taliban takeoverRussian President Vladimir Putin's special representative on Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, said on Monday Ghani’s flight from Kabul was “disgraceful,” and that the Afghan president “deserves to be brought to justice and held accountable by the Afghan people.”Also read | Will decide on recognising Taliban govt based on 'conduct': Russian envoyZhirnov said initially unarmed Taliban units had entered the capital and asked government and US forces to surrender their weapons and their main armed units entered later once Ghani fled and imposed a curfew. The Russian ambassador added the Taliban have already taken control of the security perimeter of the Russian embassy, which has over 100 staff. He said he would hold detailed security talks with the Taliban on Tuesday.The Taliban had promised, in line with earlier agreements, to protect Russian diplomats, he said. He said schools in Kabul, including those for girls, had started functioning again.Also read | Implications of US move for the worldRussia has reached out to the Taliban in recent years and hosted its representatives in Moscow several times, most recently last month. The country once tried and failed to control the hardline Islamist group before the Soviet Union withdrew its last forces in 1989.Kabulov said on Monday that Moscow's long campaign to build ties with the Taliban appeared now to be paying off. "It's not for nothing that we've been establishing contacts with the Taliban movement for the last seven years. We saw that this force would in the end if not completely come to power would play a leading role in the future of Afghanistan in any case," Kabulov told Ekho Moskvy.Kabulov said Russia would decide on recognising the new Taliban government based "on the conduct of the new authorities" and that his country "established working contacts with representatives of the new authorities".(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabuls-situation-better-under-taliban-than-it-was-under-ghani-russia-101629165185504.html

17-08-2021||World||Haiti earthquake: Death toll rises to 1,419, injured now at 6,000||A hospital in southwestern Haiti, where a powerful earthquake flattened homes, shops and other buildings over the weekend, was so overwhelmed with patients that many had to lie in patios, corridors, verandas and hallways. Then a looming storm expected to bring heavy rains Monday night forced officials to relocate them as best they could given the hospital’s poor conditions.Even those patients were somewhat fortunate. Haiti’s Civil Protection Agency on Monday raised the death toll from Saturday’s earthquake to 1,419 and the number of injured to 6,000, many of whom have had to wait under the burning heat, even on an airport tarmac, for help.“We had planned to put up tents (in hospital patios), but we were told that could not be safe,” said Gede Peterson, director of Les Cayes General Hospital.It is not the first time that staff has been forced to improvise. The refrigeration in the hospital’s morgue has not worked for three months, but after the earthquake struck Saturday, staff had to store as many as 20 bodies in the small space. Relatives quickly came to take most to private embalming services or immediate burial. By Monday only three bodies were in the morgue.The quake, centered about 125 kilometers (80 miles) west of the capital of Port-au-Prince, nearly razed some towns and triggered landslides that hampered rescue efforts in a country that is the poorest in the Western Hemisphere. Haiti already was struggling with the coronavirus pandemic, gang violence, worsening poverty and the political uncertainty following the July 7 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse when the earthquake sent residents rushing to the streets.The devastation could soon worsen with the arrival of Tropical Depression Grace, predicted to bring strong winds, heavy rain, mudslides and flash flooding. Les Cayes began to see light rain Monday evening, but it could reach 15 inches (38 centimeters) in some areas, the Civil Protection Agency said. Port-au-Prince was already seeing heavier rains.“We are working now to ensure that the resources we have are going to get to the places that are hardest hit,” said agency head Jerry Chandler, referring to the towns of Les Cayes and Jeremie and the department of Nippes, which are in the country’s southwestern portion.Injured earthquake victims continued to stream into Les Cayes’ overwhelmed general hospital, three days after the earthquake struck. Patients waited to be treated on stair steps, in corridors and the hospital’s open veranda.“After two days, they are almost always generally infected,” said Dr. Paurus Michelete, who had treated 250 patients and was one of only three doctors on call when the quake hit.Meanwhile, rescuers and scrap metal scavengers dug into the floors of a collapsed hotel Monday in this coastal town, where 15 bodies had already been extracted. Jean Moise Fortunè, whose brother, the hotel owner and a prominent politician, was killed in the quake, believed there were more people trapped in the rubble.But based on the size of voids that workers cautiously peered into, perhaps a foot (0.3 meters) in depth, finding survivors appeared unlikely.As work, fuel and money ran out, desperate Les Cayes residents searched collapsed houses for scrap metal to sell. Others waited for money wired from abroad, a mainstay of Haiti’s economy even before the quake.Anthony Emile waited six hours in a line with dozens of others trying to get money his brother had wired from Chile, where he has worked since Haiti’s last quake.“We have been waiting since morning for it, but there are too many people,” said Emile, a banana farmer who said relatives in the countryside depend on him giving them money to survive.Efforts to treat the injured were difficult at the general hospital, where Michelete said pain killers, analgesics and steel pins to mend fractures were running out amid the crush of patients.“We are saturated, and people keep coming,” he said.Josil Eliophane, 84, crouched on the steps of the hospital, clutching an X-ray showing his shattered arm bone and pleading for pain medication.Michelete said he would give one of his few remaining shots to Eliophane, who ran out of his house as the quake hit, only to have a wall fall on him.Nearby, on the hospital’s open-air veranda, patients were on beds and mattresses, hooked up to IV bags of saline fluid. Others lay in the garden under bed sheets erected to shield them from the brutal sun. None of the patients or relatives caring for them wore face masks amid a coronavirus surge.Officials said the magnitude 7.2 earthquake left more than 7,000 homes were destroyed and nearly 5,000 damaged from the quake, leaving some 30,000 families homeless. Hospitals, schools, offices and churches also were destroyed or badly damaged.Underlining the dire conditions, local officials had to negotiate with gangs in the seaside district of Martissant to allow two humanitarian convoys a day to pass through the area, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported. The agency called Haiti’s southern peninsula a “hot spot for gang-related violence,” where humanitarian workers have been repeatedly attacked.The agency said the area has been “virtually unreachable” over the past two months because of road blocks and security concerns. Agency spokeswoman Anna Jefferys said the first convoy passed through Sunday with government and U.N. personnel. and the U.N. World Food Program plans to send in food supplies via trucks Tuesday.Prime Minister Ariel Henry declared a one-month state of emergency for the whole country and said the first government aid convoys had started moving help to areas where towns were destroyed and hospitals were overwhelmed.UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said humanitarian needs were acute, with many Haitians urgently needing health care, clean water and shelter. Children separated from their parents also needed protection, she said.“Little more than a decade on, Haiti is reeling once again," Fore said, referring to the 2010 earthquake that ravaged Haiti’s capital, killing tens of thousands. “And this disaster coincides with political instability, rising gang violence, alarmingly high rates of malnutrition among children, and the COVID-19 pandemic — for which Haiti has received just 500,000 vaccine doses, despite requiring far more.”The country of 11 million people received its first batch of US-donated coronavirus vaccines only last month via a United Nations program for low-income countries.Medical workers from across the region were scrambling to help as hospitals in Les Cayes started running out of space to perform surgeries.“Basically, they need everything,” said Dr. Inobert Pierre, a pediatrician with the nonprofit Health Equity International, which oversees St. Boniface Hospital, about two hours from Les Cayes.Pierre’s medical team was taking some patients to St. Boniface to undergo surgery, but with just two ambulances, they could transport only four at a time.Working with USAID, the US Coast Guard said a helicopter was transporting medical personnel from the Haitian capital to the quake zone and evacuating injured back to Port-au-Prince. Lt. Commander Jason Nieman, a spokesman, said other aircraft and ships were being sent.At the Les Cayes hospital, Emma Cadet, 41, a carpenter’s wife, hovered over her 18-year-old son, Charles Owen, as he awaited an operation on his broken arm. He was among the lucky patients to have received pain medication.Worse off was Nerison Vendredi, 19, lying quiet but alert. No casts or splint would help her because she apparently had suffered internal injuries and could not move.There were some stories of miracle survivals, but they were becoming fewer as the days passed.Jacquelion Luxama was leading his goats to a watering hole Saturday when a hillside collapsed on him, trapping him amid boulders and a rockslide that stripped skin from his hip.“I started yelling, and luckily some other famers heard me, and they came and pulled me out, ” said Luxama, lying on a mattress at the Les Cayes hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/haiti-earthquake-death-toll-rises-to-1-419-injured-now-at-6000-101629160634104.html
17-08-2021||World||Prince Andrew 'a person of interest' in Epstein probe||US prosecutors probing the activities of British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell and others linked to US financier Jeffrey Epstein consider Prince Andrew a person of interest in the investigation, a source familiar with the US inquiry said.Investigators want to interview Andrew, Queen Elizabeth’s second son, about his friendship with Epstein as part of their inquiry into possible co-conspirators, the source said. As a person of interest he is viewed at least as a potential witness.Prosecutors in 2020 said Andrew had “sought to falsely portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate” but had given no interview to federal authorities and had repeatedly declined requests to talk with investigators.While Andrew remains a person of interest to prosecutors in the office of the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, they do not expect to be able to interview him in the foreseeable future, if ever, according to the source."He doesn't seem to want to talk to us," said the source.Representatives of the Prince declined to comment.Earlier this month, Virginia Giuffre, who has said she was abused by Epstein, filed a civil complaint against Andrew in Manhattan federal court. Giuffre alleges Andrew forced her to have unwanted sexual intercourse at Maxwell's London home.Andrew has denied the allegation.Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of trafficking minors.Ghislaine Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to charges that she procured teenage girls for Epstein to sexually abuse between 1994 and 2004. She is expected to go on trial in November.Prosecutors last year sent the British government a formal request, known as a mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) submission, asking for access to the prince so they could talk to him.The MLAT is a procedure used in criminal investigations to gather material from foreign countries which cannot readily be obtained on a cooperative basis.Giuffre's lawyer had no immediate comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-andrew-a-person-of-interest-in-epstein-probe-101629160077332.html
17-08-2021||World||US may see 200k Covid cases daily soon: Top doctor||Warning of tough days ahead with surging Covid-19 infections, the director of the National Institutes of Health said Sunday that unvaccinated people are “sitting ducks” for a Delta variant that is ravaging the country and showing little sign of letting up“This is going very steeply upward with no signs of having peaked out,” Dr Francis Collins told “Fox News Sunday”.While the US currently is seeing an average of about 129,000 new infections a day — a 700% increase from the beginning of July — that number could jump in the next couple weeks to 200,000, a level not seen since among the pandemic’s worst days in January and February, Collins said.He said the US could decide in the next couple weeks whether to offer coronavirus booster shots to Americans this fall. Among the first to receive them could be health care workers, nursing home residents and other older Americans.Federal health officials have been actively looking at whether extra shots for the vaccinated may be needed as early as this fall, reviewing case numbers in the US “almost daily” as well as the situation in other countries such as Israel, where preliminary studies suggest the vaccine’s protection against serious illness dropped among those vaccinated in January.“There is a concern that the vaccine may start to wane in its effectiveness,” Collins said. “And Delta is a nasty one for us to try to deal with. The combination of those two means we may need boosters, maybe beginning first with health care providers, as well as people in nursing homes, and then gradually moving forward” with others.Areas with low vaccination rates have been particularly hit hard with infections, such as Louisiana, Texas, Florida and Mississippi.The rapidly escalating surge in infections across the US has caused a shortage of intensive care-unit beds, nurses and other front-line staff in virus hot spots that can no longer keep up with the flood of unvaccinated patients.“That’s heartbreaking considering we never thought we would be back in that space again,” Collins said of rising US infections overall. “But here we are with the Delta variant.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/usmay-see-200k-covid-cases-daily-soon-top-doctor-101629158338071.html
17-08-2021||World||Implications of US move for the world||The Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan, including the capital city of Kabul, has triggered concern across the world, and rightly so. Afghanistan would not have fallen to the Taliban had the United States not withdrawn its troops from the country. While the US had announced its troop withdrawal much earlier, the fact that it did not reconsider its decision even in the face of a near meltdown of the Afghan government’s resistance has drawn widespread criticism. The move has left a large section of the anti-Taliban Afghan population at the mercy of the group. As the world, especially India, will have to come to terms with the fallout of the Taliban establishing an Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan, the US’s indifference to the development has raised questions about its role as a global superpower.Many commentators have written that the US withdrawal from Afghanistan is primarily driven by domestic political-economic concerns, even if they undermine its self-proclaimed role as the vanguard of liberalism and democracy.An HT analysis shows that this is a reality which actually goes beyond the US’s willingness (or lack of it) to undertake military commitments outside its borders. The US has been displaying a similar tendency in fulfilling its role as the global capitalist leader, a term which was first popularised by Charles P Kindleberger, an economic historian who gave among the best accounts of the Great Depression of the 1930s. While the humanitarian and strategic implications of the US’s withdrawal from Afghanistan are likely to be catastrophic, the fallout of its economic actions (detailed below) is likely to be equally, if not more, profound for the world as we know it today. Here are three charts which explain this argument in detail.US military spending has gone down with the end of the Cold WarAmong the many things that forced the US to withdraw from Afghanistan was the cost of fighting a war which it could not decisively win even after two decades. According to an estimate by the Cost of War project by Watson Institute at Brown University, the Afghan war cost $2.26 trillion to the US between 2001 and 2021. This is almost 10% of the current annual GDP of the US. While saving dollars might have been a pressing concern in the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the so called “War on Terror” itself was an aberration in the US’s declining military spending from the peak of the Cold War era. World Bank statistics on the share of military spending in US GDP – it came down from just under 10% in the 1960s to just above 3% by the end of 1990s – proves this point. With the US out of both Iraq and Afghanistan now, its military spending is bound to come down further.US trade policy has taken a mercantilist turnKindleberger, among the most influential economic historians of the world, whose work on the Great Depression of the 1930s is considered to be a masterpiece, spoke about the need for a global capitalist leader for the stability of the international economic order. The Great Depression, according to Kindleberger, happened because Britain was not in a position to fulfil this role and the US, the emerging superpower, was not willing to take on the mantle. The US assumed this role in the period after the Second World War, triggering what is described as the Golden Age of capitalism. The US began its hegemonic phase with the Marshall Plan, where it funded reconstruction of war-ravaged Europe and also ran large trade deficits with many countries with anti-communist regimes. Being a “lender of last resort” and providing home market access were important requirements of what Kindleberger described as the role of a global capitalist leader. What began as a “stop the spread of communism” project, eventually culminated in the US aiding the rise of communist China as an economic superpower, emerging the biggest market for Chinese exports.A rise in outsourcing, destruction of domestic blue-collar jobs and the associated economic pain triggered a massive backlash in US’s domestic politics against globalisation, the biggest manifestation of which was Donald Trump’s victory in 2016. While the trend of a falling US trade deficit has stagnated in the past few years, and the post-pandemic recovery has seen a spike in imports, it is unlikely that the US will ever revert to the policy of throwing open its markets to strategic allies as it did during the Cold War. This will matter to countries such as India, whose strategic alliance with the US is stronger than ever today.Wall Street’s dominance, low interest rates and a looming financial sector crisisThe US government has remained unmoved to widespread appeals for reconsidering or even recalibrating the withdrawal from Afghanistan. This is in sharp contrast to the sensitivity the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, displays to criticism from financial markets whenever there is talk of raising interest rates, which are at near zero levels. A low interest rate regime in the US encourages investment in speculative assets such as shares both within and outside the country. Even a little talk of raising interest rates in the US, which will lead to money flowing back from riskier assets to the low-risk ones, can create a huge upset in financial markets, as happened during the “taper tantrum” of 2013.What is also true, however, is the fact that a prolonged cheap money-driven stock market book can sow the seeds of financial sector instability and an economic shock, when a correction finally comes. While it is always difficult to predict when this moment will come, it will not be an exaggeration to say that by encouraging a low interest-driven financial sector boom, the US has become, either by omission or commission, a source of systemic instability rather than being a hegemon which brought stability to the global capitalist system. The chaos in Afghanistan is definitely heart-wrenching but it is not the last such episode we will emerge out of the US’s actions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/implications-of-us-move-for-the-world-101629155322556.html
17-08-2021||World||'Stand squarely behind my decision to withdraw our forces': Biden||President Joe Biden defended the US pullout of Afghanistan Monday, saying he stood by the policy and that it was time to leave after 20 years of conflict."I stand squarely behind my decision. After 20 years, I've learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw US forces," he said in a televised address from the White House.He added that the US national interest in Afghanistan was always principally about preventing terrorist attacks from the war-torn nation on the US homeland."The mission in Afghanistan was never supposed to be nation-building," he said.He acknowledged that the Afghan government collapsed more quickly than he expected even as he defended his decision to withdraw troops."I always promised the American people that I will be straight with you. The truth is, this did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated," Biden said in a national address."We gave them every chance to determine their own future. We could not provide them with the will to fight for that future."Biden promised to prioritize the treatment of women and girls under the Taliban in Afghanistan after a US withdrawal allowed the return of the Islamist insurgents."We'll continue to speak out on the basic rights of the Afghan people, of women and girls," Biden said in a national address.He also warned the Taliban not to disrupt or threaten the evacuation of thousands of American diplomats and Afghan translators at the Kabul airport.The response to any attack would be "swift and forceful," Biden said in a televised address from the White House."We will defend our people with devastating force if necessary," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stand-squarely-behind-my-decision-to-withdraw-our-forces-biden-101629145469815.html
17-08-2021||World||Under attack, Biden returns to White House to speak on Afghanistan||US President Joe Biden will return to the White House and speak on Afghanistan at 1.15am on Tuesday in a bid perhaps to address criticism of the chaotic pullout of American troops and personnel and the swift return of the Taliban that he and his administration failed to foresee. Biden’s return from the president’s retreat where he was vacationing and the speech were announced in a revised guidance issued by the White House on Monday morning.CNN news anchor JakeTapper’s first question to US secretary of state Antony Blinken on his Sunday morning show captured the sense of how the rest of the United States was viewing President Joe Biden’s recent decisions on Afghanistan: “How did President Biden get this so wrong?” As morning hour wore on and Al Jazeera news channel began running clips of Taliban fighters walking around inside the President Palace abandoned by former president Ashraf Ghani, Biden was facing similar questions from both supporters and critics, with varying degrees of outrage and frustration. “This is going to be a stain on this president and this presidency,” said Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Relations Committee, on the same programme with Tapper. “I think he is going to have blood on his hands for what they did.” Ryan Crocker, who was president Barack Obama’s ambassador to Afghanistan, could sense the impending disaster. “I’m left with some grave questions in my mind about his ability to lead our nation as commander-in-chief,” Crocker told The Spokesman-Review, a Washington state publication, on Sunday morning, shortly before news came of the Taliban entering Kabul. “To have read this so wrong - or, even worse, to have understood what was likely to happen and not care,” the former ambassador of the Obama-Biden administration added. Biden did not issue any statement or posted a tweet all day. He was vacationing at the Camp David presidential retreat in the adjoining state of Maryland. As questions began to be raise about where was the president at this critical juncture in the nation’s history, the White House released a picture of him at a long table in a room with flags in a virtual conference with his national security team. Dressed in a casual T-shirt, he looked terribly alone. “This morning, the president and vice-president met with their national security team and senior officials to hear updates on the drawdown of our civilian personnel in Afghanistan, evacuations of SIV (special immigration visa) applicants and other Afghan allies, and the ongoing security situation in Kabul,” the White House wrote in the tweet. Barely a month ago, Biden has strenuously discounted any chance of the Taliban gaining early control of Kabul and the country. “Afghan troops have 300,000 well-equipped - as well-equipped as any army in the world - and an air force against something like 75,000 Taliban. It is not inevitable,” he had said on July 8 when asked if Taliban takeover was inevitable. More recently, Biden has said he does not regret the decision to pull US forces out of Afghanistan ending a “forever war”, but as the Taliban advanced swiftly in recent days to take control of the country, he has sought to deflect some of the criticism of his own actions by pointing to the flawed deal he inherited from Trump. “I inherited a deal cut by my predecessor - which he invited the Taliban to discuss at Camp David on the eve of 9/11 of 2019 -that left the Taliban in the strongest position militarily since 2001 and imposed a May 1, 2021 deadline on US forces,” Biden said, referring to a meeting that Trump had wanted to host at Camp David but did not. Trump had also drawn down US forces to a “a bare minimum of 2,500”, Biden, said, adding, that when he took over as president, he had two choices “follow through on the deal, with a brief extension to get our forces and our allies’ forces out safely, or ramp up our presence and send more American troops to fight once again in another country’s civil conflict”. Biden and his officials have since gone on to blame the “hollow” response of the Afghan army and security forces and their inability to hold off the Taliban despite their numerical superiority and better American-supplied equipment. “We would have been back at war with tens of thousands of troops having to go in because the 2,500 troops we had there and the air power would not have sufficed to deal with the situation, especially as we see, alas, the hollowness of the Afghan security forces,” Blinken said in the CNN interview.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/under-attack-biden-returns-to-white-house-to-speak-on-afghanistan-101629142168657.html

His compatriot assisted him in finding the place after Asif escaped Afghanistan on the last commercial flight from Kabul to Delhi.With tears in his eyes and speaking in broken Hindi, the 41-year-old officer said, “I had to run, else the Taliban would have killed me. Everything ends here. I could not bring my family along.”Asif fled the war-torn nation, which was completely captured by the Taliban on Sunday, leaving behind his ailing mother, wife and an 8-year-old son.He said that he “will try” to get a cheaper room in Delhi that costs between ₹200 and ₹300. The officer of the National Directorate of Security (NDS), however, broke down when asked if he had food while departing from Afghanistan. As his hands shook and lips quivered with tears streaming down his face, Asif showed his passport, an NDS ID card and photographs of his family from a bag he carried.He said that the Taliban are “catching [and] killing” them. “They sent us notices, asking us to revolt against the government or die,” Asif added.Stating that all hopes of survival were quashed following Afghan president Ashraf Ghani fleeing the country, the officer informed that hundreds of Afghan officers like him from the security establishments have “fled to Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and other countries.”Also Read | President Ashraf Ghani leaves Afghanistan as Taliban take over KabulAsif said he didn’t know how his family had been doing back in Afghanistan as internet services were affected in certain regions of Kabul, which fell into the hands of Taliban on Sunday. “I got my visa a month ago. Ten days ago, we had intel that the Taliban is going to return,” he added.The NDS officer, looking back at his life in his homeland, pointed out that Pakistan “betrayed [them].”He added that he and some of his colleagues, who also took the last flight to India, had changed into civilian robes before boarding the plane. Notably, the national carrier Air India said on Monday that commercial flights have been suspended to Kabul owing to the closure of Afghanistan’s airspace. As many as 129 passengers were brought back to India on Sunday after flight AI 244 departed from Kabul at 6.06pm. The Monday morning flight was first rescheduled and later cancelled.Also Read | Air India can’t operate Kabul flight as airspace shuts downAsif also highlighted how women in Kabul have already commenced to ditch salwar-kameez for burqas, and have been staying off streets – keeping indoors, adding that they will be killed if they don’t.“Sab khatam (everything is over) …There’s no chance we will ever return to our country. Our beloved home is lost. I don’t even know if my family will be able to make it to India,” he said.Similar to Asif, one of Ghani’s advisors on public health affairs, R Ahmadzai, also arrived in Delhi on Sunday after the Taliban’s entry into the capital city of Afghanistan. He said all Afghan politicians and ministers have fled Afghanistan.“There was a lot of anxiety and depression over the last one month, but now there is not much fighting [in Afghanistan]. People are at peace now,” the advisor said.He added that around 200 such ministers and advisors like him have reached Delhi, and that till 5pm on Sunday, Ghani was in Afghanistan. “We don’t know where Ghani has left for,” Ahmadzai said.Watch here | Afghan president's advisor arrives in India, says all ministers left KabulHe further stated that the Taliban have promised that they won’t impose a brutal rule over the country like the last time, and will especially allow more freedom to women and girls, including letting them work wearing a hijab.Ghani’s departure, leaving behind his country, has drawn major flak with regional social media platforms even calling him a “coward.” However, the former President defended his choice saying that the Taliban made their way back into Afghanistan with their “swords and guns” and that he escaped to prevent a “flood of bloodshed.”Notably, Taliban captured the presidential palace on Sunday itself.Meanwhile, US troops reportedly temporarily closed the evacuation of its diplomats and other citizens from Afghanistan on Monday in order to clear the airfield at the Hamid Karzai International Airport, senior defence officials said.This came after they reportedly fired shots into the air when several Afghans tried to catch the planes at the Kabul airport to flee Afghanistan.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-intel-officer-fled-to-delhi-on-last-flight-from-kabul-to-escape-taliban-101629139600183.html
