At this time, I think these are early days. Our focus right now is on ensuring the safety and security of Indian nationals.”India has had long historical ties with Afghanistan and since 2001, after the fall of Taliban 1.0, it has extended development assistance worth an estimated $3 billion covering an entire range of areas - from health, banking, water, power generation, transportation and reconstructing schools. It also built Afghanistan’s new parliament.Pressed by another reporter on whether India has had contacts with the Taliban in recent days, the minister said, “We are looking at what is the evolving situation in Kabul, obviously the Taliban, and its representatives have come to Kabul so I think we need to take it on from there.”The ministry of external affairs had indicated some contacts with the Taliban in response to news reports of an exchange of messages. It had said India was in contact with “various stakeholders” in Afghanistan but that was in June, before the Taliban had begun their swift march back to power in Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-will-be-guided-by-its-ties-with-afghan-people-jaishankar-101629308860262.html

"Our ulema (scholars) will decide whether girls are allowed to go to school or not," Hashimi told news agency Reuters on Wednesday.Hashmi said Islamic scholars would take a call on how women are required to dress under the new Taliban regime. "They will decide whether they should wear hijab, burqa, or only (a) veil plus abaya or something, or not. That is up to them," Hashimi added.Just a day before, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid had declared at the Taliban's first media conference following their siege of Kabul that women would play an active role in Afghan society “but within the framework of Islam”. Mujahid had also said that women will be allowed to study and work in Afghan society. However, just hours later the Islamist militant group had reportedly killed a woman for not covering her head in public, the New York Post reported.The Taliban had assured women and international organisations that they would continue to enjoy the rights guaranteed under Islamic law. However, just this week news agency Reuters reported that Taliban fighters had walked into the offices of two prominent banks in Herat and Kandahar and asked the women working there to not return to their jobs. Radio Presenter Shabnam Dawran said in a video shared on Twitter on Wednesday that she was turned away from her job at Afghanistan's state-owned Radio Television Afghanistan. "They told me that the regime has changed. You are not allowed, go home," she said.Armed members of the insurgent group have been going around the country, knocking on the doors of residents, asking them to return to their jobs. On Wednesday morning three armed men knocked at the door of 38-year old Wasima, who lives in the western city of Herat, took down her details, enquired about her job, remuneration, and asked her to resume working, reported Reuters.The Taliban, during its earlier regime between 1996 and 2001, had imposed strict Islamic law and prohibited women from studying or working, and made it mandatory for all women to be accompanied by a male relative in public. With the return of the regime after 20 years of battle with the US-led forces, Afghan women fear all the gains made in respect to women’s rights could be lost and suppressed, a fear which the international community, too, shares.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/islamic-scholars-to-decide-on-women-s-right-to-education-taliban-leader-101629307345479.html
18-08-2021||World||India calls for focus on technology in UN peacekeeping operations||India on Wednesday said the UN peacekeeping operations “must be anchored in a strong ecosystem of technology and innovation” to adapt to changing conflict dynamics and proposed a four-point framework at the Security Council that called, most importantly, for greater focus on “operationally proven, cost-effective, widely available, reliable and field-serviceable technologies”.At a meeting hosted by India, which holds the rotational presidency of the UN Security Council for August, and chaired by external affairs minister S Jaishankar, the body adopted a first-ever technology-related presidential statement in regard to peacekeeping - “Technology for Peacekeeping” - that called for recognising “technology has the potential to act as a force multiplier”.FOCUS ON ACCOUNTABILITYThe top UN body also adopted a resolution drafted by India - “Accountability of Crimes against UN Peacekeepers” - to protect peacekeepers from violence by calling upon member states that host them to take all appropriate measures, to “bring to justice perpetrators of the killing of, and all acts of violence against United Nations personnel”, to “promote accountability” and urged the secretary general to ensure member states did that by every means possible. The resolution was co-sponsored by all 15 members of the Security Council and was the first to be adopted unanimously, and it has also been supported by 80 members of the UN General Assembly.The meeting on peacekeeping is the second signature event India is hosting as UNSC president. The first was on maritime security which was chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who became the first Indian prime minister to chair a UNSC debate. The third is scheduled for Thursday, and it will be on counter-terrorism, to be chaired, once again, by Jaishankar.PEACEKEEPING IN 21ST CENTURY“Twenty-first century peacekeeping must be anchored in a strong ecosystem of technology and innovation that can facilitate UN peacekeeping operations in implementing their mandates in complex environments,” Jaishankar said. “After all, it helps them to adapt to changing conflict dynamics and take advantage of increased efficiencies.”Recalling the leading role played by India in UN peacekeeping operations as the country that has made the most sacrifices while participating in these missions and whose men and women are currently deployed in nine missions around the world, Jaishankar said, “To execute their mandates, peacekeeping missions must be able to move fast to acquire and validate, information from a wide range of openly available sources to enhance situational awareness, augment security, aid operational planning, and support decision-making.”The external affairs minister went on to announce a four-point point framework for securing UN peacekeepers to meet contemporary threats. “We must focus on operationally proven, cost-effective, widely available, reliable and field-serviceable technologies,” the minister said, adding, “These must also prioritise mobility, both in the sense of agile manoeuverability of mission assets and in the sense of use of mobile digital/IT platforms.”A sound information and intelligence foundation, he said, is the second point of his framework. And in this regard, he announced that India is supporting the UN in the roll-out of the UNITE Aware Platform across select peacekeeping missions. “This initiative is based on the expectation that an entire peacekeeping operation can be visualised, coordinated, and monitored on a real time basis,” the minister said, adding, “ We should ensure that any attack on a peacekeeper or a civilian is predictable, preventable, or responded to immediately.” It is being rolled out in four missions that are currently under way.Thirdly, the minister said, efforts must be made to ensure “technological improvements are continuous and are available on the ground, in the gear peacekeepers carry”; and fourthly, more attention should be paid to “consistent training and capacity building of peacekeepers in the realm of technology”.The minister had laid a wreath at the Peacekeepers Memorial on Wednesday morning along with UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres. CHALLENGES FOR UNGuterres also attended the meeting and briefed the member on the challenges and steps UN is taking. “UN peacekeeping was conceived in an analog world. It is now essential that it fully embraces … world in which we live, to improve the world’s agility, anticipation and responsiveness to conflicts, and to be able to address the challenges of today and tomorrow,” said Guterres, adding, “A shift in peacekeeping culture, as well as a systemic change are required for this new weapon.”Recalling the work done by peacekeepers in “world’s most severe circumstances, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US permanent representative to the UN, said, “They deserve the most advanced cutting edge technology to help them do this difficult job better, The right technology helps keep peacekeepers safe, and it helps them keep the communities they serve safe too. So it is our duty to ensure they have the technology and use it appropriately. After all, we all share responsibility for ensuring the safety and security of peacekeepers, as they in turn protect civilians.”In the Presidential Statement on “Technology for Peacekeeping”, which speaks for the Security Council, the top UN body called for recognising “technology has the potential to act as a force multiplier by enhancing performance, saving resources, simplifying work processes, and allowing peacekeeping missions to have a deeper understanding of the environments they operate in, through improved collection, analysis and dissemination of data”.The council “stresses the need to leverage the technological tools available to support greater situational awareness of peacekeeping missions and their front-line peacekeepers”, said the statement.The council “encourages better integration of existing and new technologies, especially digital technology … (and) continued efforts to enhance peacekeepers’ operational readiness and performance in the use of standardised technologies and services”.The statement urged the secretary-general to “continue to work with member states in exploring available and future technologies and best practices that can contribute towards the safety and security of peacekeepers and protection of civilians”.PROTECTING PEACEKEEPERSUnderscoring the importance of peacekeeping, the council adopted a resolution - “Accountability of Crimes against UN Peacekeepers” - condemned in “”the strongest terms” the killing of, and all acts of violence against United Nations personnel serving in peacekeeping operations, and their detention and abduction; and expressed “serious concerns regarding challenges in bringing to justice perpetrators saying “the rate of prosecution of such crimes has remained very low, which has further contributed to an environment of impunity, and undermined the safety and security of such personnel”.The resolution called upon member states that host peacekeepers to take all appropriate measures, to bring to justice perpetrators of the killing of, and all acts of violence against United Nations personnel; “promote accountability” for this violence; and urged the secretary general to ensure this accountability among member states. It also requested the top UN official to “establish a comprehensive online database” in this regard; and, finally, notify the relevant national authorities immediately upon receiving reports of the killing of, and all acts of violence against United Nations personnel.The resolution also suggested that every UN peacekeeping mission must have “a focal point for all issues related to the prevention, investigation and prosecution of violence against peacekeepers”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-calls-for-focus-on-technology-in-un-peacekeeping-operations-101629307359666.html

The UN health agency has also pointed out that the current data available does not suggest that a top-up shot against the disease is needed.The remarks came as the US government, earlier in the day, announced its plan to make available a booster shot for its people starting September 20 amid rising concerns due to the Delta variant of Covid-19. US officials have also warned that the protection offered by the vaccines waned over time, citing findings from recent assessments.However, top scientists at the WHO have expressed their objection to this plan, noting that some poorer countries do not have enough shots for even the first dose. WHO’s chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan on Wednesday said data indicated that booster shots were not needed. “We believe clearly that the data does not indicate that boosters are needed,” the Associated Press quoted her as saying.Also read | India gave 2L vaccines for UN peacekeepers: Jaishankar at tech platform launchThe chief scientist said that more research was needed regarding administering a booster shot. She further warned that the risk of newer variants of the disease emerging would increase if billions of people in the developing world were left unvaccinated. She also said that it could result in “even more dire situations.”Notably, Dr Swaminathan also warned earlier in the day that globally a surge in Delta variant of Covid-19 was observed in regions with less coverage of vaccines.Meanwhile, the executive director of the WHO health emergencies programme, Dr Michael Ryan, too, recorded his concerns regarding global vaccine distribution. “We’re planning to hand out extra life jackets to people who already have life jackets, while we’re leaving other people to drown without a single life jacket,” he said.Dr Bruce Aylward, senior advisor to WHO’s director-general on organizational change said “There is enough vaccine around the world, but it is not going to the right places in the right order.”He added that two doses of the vaccine should first be given to the “most vulnerable” people worldwide before delivering booster shots to those who are already fully inoculated, pointing out “We are a long, long way from that.”Further, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus too insisted on prioritising vaccine rollout globally before delivering boosters. “What is clear is that it's critical to get first shots into arms and protect the most vulnerable before boosters are rolled out,” he said.In response to the WHO’s concerns, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that the US is the biggest contributor to the global fight against the pandemic and will “continue to be the arsenal for vaccines.”US surgeon general Vivek Murthy also outlined that they “clearly see our responsibility to both, and we've got to do everything we can to protect people here at home while recognizing that tamping down the epidemic across the world is going to be key.”Last week, the US had announced its plan to provide a booster shot to people with weakened immune systems, which has now been expanded to include all people in the country. Earlier in the day, US officials, in a statement, said that people who were immunised with the Pfizer or the Moderna vaccines would need a booster dose eight months after taking the second doses, while they were awaiting data regarding Johnson and Johson’s vaccine.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-covid-19-vaccine-distribution-key-concern-for-who-experts-as-the-us-presses-on-with-plan-for-boosters-101629306668909.html

It cautioned that the Delta variant was spreading even in countries with high vaccination rates at the national level."Many of the places around the world where Delta is surging -- even in countries that at a national level have high levels of vaccination coverage -- the virus, the Delta variant itself, is really circulating in areas of low level of vaccine coverage and in the context of very limited and inconsistent use of public health and social measures," WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove told an online news briefing, reported Reuters.Also Read: US gives its nod for Covid-19 booster shot to counter declining vaccine efficacy over timeWHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told Reuters on Wednesday that Covid-19 vaccines offer protection against death and severe illness but cautioned that there’s no need for administering booster shots at the moment.

Knowing the militant group is almost certain not to uphold the adoption agreements from the collapsed Afghan government, the American couple's best hope is to get the boy out, fast.“Once they get to the airport, it's just a matter of waiting time. But it's a matter of waiting a few hours or a few days,” Bahaudin Mujtaba said. Noman is currently in the custody of another family trying to leave.Maybe they can get the boy to a nearby country. Maybe Pakistan. Wherever they go, he's willing to fly there and meet him.“But the first goal is to get him out of Afghanistan safely,” Mujtaba said.It's unclear how many among the throngs of people trying to flee Afghanistan include potential adoptive children. One other US family, based in Indiana, is working with the same adoption agency as Mujtaba and is trying to get a 2-year-old boy out of the country.Mary King, executive director of Frank Adoption Center in Wake Forest, North Carolina, is working with the families and said they had full permission from Afghan courts to bring the children to the US and finalise the adoptions. They were awaiting US visas, but everything changed in the past few days.“This all came about much faster than any of us anticipated, so we don't know,” she said. “We have put them on every list. We've filled out every form we've been told about. Their names are everywhere we can get them, as far as with the appropriate US authorities. And so now we are waiting to hear what may happen next.”US adoptions from Afghanistan are relatively rare compared with adoptions from other countries, according to State Department data. From 1999 through 2019, 41 Afghan children were adopted by US families. That's far fewer than other countries in the region, including 148 children from Iran and 667 from Pakistan. Other countries, like China, Ukraine and Colombia, have seen thousands of children adopted by US families over the past two decades.The process in Afghanistan required working through the Afghan Family Court, which limited the guardianship process to Muslim parents. Families that receive permission from the court can then bring a child to the US to finalise an adoption, according to the State Department.But under Taliban rule, it's all but certain not to be permitted now, Mujtaba said, especially from a family based in the USMujtaba and his adoption agency have reached out to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's office for help. Mujtaba has even offered to go to Afghanistan with the US military, offering his familiarity with the language and culture in return for a chance to bring the boy home.Rubio's office confirmed it is working with Mujtaba and the adoption agency but did not offer more details about what options the senator's staff was pursuing.Mujtaba and his wife agreed to adopt Noman, a distant relative, after Mujtaba met him during a visit to Kabul five years ago.“I just basically fell in love with this little boy. And based on hearing everything, then we knew we had the means and the motivation to help him,” he said.The child's mother died of cancer, leaving the boy with his adult brothers and elderly father who is unable to care for him. Mujtaba described Noman as “a little boy who has big dreams.” He loves music, gets top grades in school and wants to become an engineer or a doctor -- a profession Mujtaba said the boy may be drawn to because he's had to meet with so many doctors.Noman appears to have diabetes and other medical issues, possibly stemming from nutrition problems, but Mujtaba said it's not totally clear if the doctors in Afghanistan gave him the right diagnosis or the treatments.“That's the environment, unfortunately, that you're in, in Afghanistan,” he said. “We're not really sure exactly what the problems might be, once we get here. He's fine for a period of time and then, unfortunately, he's not.”Mujtaba is an US citizen who emigrated from Afghanistan 40 years ago. After the Taliban was displaced two decades ago, he returned in 2005 to the country of his birth for the first time in 20 years. He's visited Noman 10 times over the past years, staying three to five weeks at a time.His wife, who is American, has never been to Afghanistan or met the boy in person because it seemed too dangerous to bring her, Mujtaba said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-families-mid-adoption-fear-taliban-might-not-uphold-agreements-try-to-get-afghan-children-out-101629301068381.html

We hope that Afghanistan can form an open, inclusive, and broadly representative government that echoes the widely shared aspirations of its own people and the international community,” Zhao said when asked about Beijing’s stand on recognising the Taliban government in Kabul.China, Zhao said hopes that all parties in Afghanistan would resolve differences through dialogue and consultation, avoid new conflicts and humanitarian disasters, and work towards smooth transition in the Afghan situation.“As a friendly neighbour to and sincere friend of Afghanistan, China upholds a friendly policy towards the entire Afghan people. This did not, does not and will not change. China will continue to support peace and reconstruction in Afghanistan, and provide help for socioeconomic development in Afghanistan as our ability permits,” the spokesperson said.Zhao reiterated that the Taliban should crack down on the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), which it has accused of fomenting unrest and separatism in China’s northwestern region of Xinjiang.Afghanistan and Xinjiang share a remote border of around 70km.“At the same time, we hope it will resolutely crack down on all kinds of terrorist forces, including the ETIM, and earnestly honour the commitment of not allowing any force to use Afghan territory to threaten the security of its neighbours,” he said.Beijing has strongly criticised what it calls the “hasty” retreat of US forces for the current instability in Afghanistan.China has sought good relations with both the former Afghan government and the Taliban, hosting the group’s top political leader, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, for talks with state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi in July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-wait-for-govt-formation-before-recognising-taliban-regime-101629297158997.html
18-08-2021||World||Taliban violently disperse rare protest in Jalalabad, killing 1 and wounding 6||The Taliban violently broke up a protest in eastern Afghanistan on Wednesday, killing at least one person as they quashed a rare public show of dissent. The militant group meanwhile met with former officials from the toppled Western-backed government.As officials work to shape a future government, the United Arab Emirates acknowledged that Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who fled the Taliban advance, and his family were in that country.The Taliban's every action in their sudden sweep to power is being watched closely. They insist they have changed and won’t impose the same draconian restrictions they did when they last ruled Afghanistan, all but eliminating women’s rights, carrying out public executions and harboring al-Qaida in the years before the 9/11 attacks.But many Afghans remain deeply skeptical, and the violent response to Wednesday's protest could only fuel their fears. Thousands are racing to the airport and borders to flee the country. Many others are hiding inside their homes, fearful after prisons and armories were emptied during the insurgents’ blitz across the country.Dozens of people gathered in the eastern city of Jalalabad to raise the national flag a day before Afghanistan's Independence Day, which commemorates the end of British rule in 1919. They lowered the Taliban flag — a white banner with an Islamic inscription — that the militants have raised in the areas they captured.Video footage later showed the Taliban firing into the air and attacking people with batons to disperse the crowd. Babrak Amirzada, a reporter for a local news agency, said he and a TV cameraman from another agency were beaten by the Taliban as they tried to cover the unrest.A local health official said at least one person was killed and six wounded. The official was not authorized to speak to media and so spoke on condition of anonymity.Meanwhile, videos from the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul, a stronghold of the Northern Alliance militias that allied with the US against the Taliban in 2001, appear to show potential opposition figures gathering there. It's in the only province that hasn't yet fallen to the Taliban.Those figures include members of the deposed government — Vice President Amrullah Saleh, who asserted on Twitter that he is the country’s rightful president and Defense Minister Gen. Bismillah Mohammadi — as well as Ahmad Massoud, the son of the slain Northern Alliance leader Ahmad Shah Massoud. It's unclear if they intend to challenge to the Taliban, who seized most of the country in a matter of days last week.The Taliban, meanwhile, pressed ahead with their efforts to form an “inclusive, Islamic government.” They have been holding talks with former Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, a senior official in the ousted government. Mohammad Yusof Saha, a spokesman for Karzai, said preliminary meetings with Taliban officials would facilitate eventual negotiations with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the top Taliban political leader, who returned to the country this week.Karzai and Abdullah met Wednesday with Anas Haqqani, a senior leader in a powerful Taliban faction. The US branded the Haqqani network a terrorist group in 2012, and its involvement in a future government could trigger international sanctions.Meanwhile, the UAE's Foreign Ministry acknowledged in a one-sentence statement that Ghani and his family were in the country for “humanitarian considerations” The President fled the Taliban advance on Sunday and disappeared amid widespread anger from Afghans over the collapse of the country’s security forces.The US Embassy in Abu Dhabi did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It was unclear if he’d received any other assistance. The UAE is a close US ally.Amid the uncertainty, thousands of Afghans have tried to flee the country in recent days, and the US and its allies have struggled to manage a chaotic withdrawal from the country.Hundreds of people were outside the airport early Wednesday. The Taliban demanded to see documents before allowing the rare passenger inside. Many of the people outside did not appear to have passports, and each time the gate opened even an inch, dozens tried to push through. The Taliban fired occasional warning shots to disperse them.In Kabul, groups of Taliban fighters carrying long guns patrolled a well-to-do neighborhood that is home to many embassies as well as mansions of the Afghan elite.The Taliban have promised to maintain security, but residents say groups of armed men have been going door to door inquiring about Afghans who worked with the Americans or the deposed government. It’s unclear if the gunmen are Taliban or criminals posing as militants.Another Taliban promise being closely watched is their vow to prevent Afghanistan from again being used as a base for planning terrorist attacks. That was enshrined in a 2020 peace deal with the Trump administration that paved the way for the drawdown of American troops, the last of whom are supposed to leave at the end of the month.When the Taliban were last in power they sheltered Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida group, which carried out the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. US officials fear al-Qaida and other groups could reconstitute themselves in Afghanistan now that the Taliban are back in power.Elsewhere in Afghanistan, the Taliban blew up a statue depicting Abdul Ali Mazari, a militia leader killed by the Taliban in 1996, when the Islamic militants seized power from rival warlords. Mazari was a champion of Afghanistan’s ethnic Hazara minority, Shiites who were persecuted under the Sunni Taliban’s earlier rule. That further raised concerns about whether they would make good on their promises, including not seeking revenge on those who have opposed them.In a sign of the difficulties any future Afghan government will face, the head of Afghanistan’s Central Bank said the country's supply of physical US dollars is “close to zero." Afghanistan has some $9 billion in reserves, Ajmal Ahmady tweeted, but most is held outside the country, with some $7 billion held in US Federal Reserve bonds, assets and gold.Ahmady said the country did not receive a planned cash shipment amid the Taliban offensive.“The next shipment never arrived,” he wrote. “Seems like our partners had good intelligence as to what was going to happen.”He said the lack of U dollars will likely lead to a depreciation of the local currency, the afghani, hurting the country's poor. Afghans have been lining up outside ATM machines for days, with many pulling out their life savings.Ahmady said the Taliban will struggle to access the country's reserves because of international sanctions.The “Taliban won militarily — but now have to govern,” he wrote. “It is not easy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-violently-disperse-rare-protest-in-jalalabad-killing-1-and-wounding-6-101629295457473.html

18-08-2021||World||Why vaccinated people largely escaped the worst of Delta surge? Study explains||The Delta variant of the coronavirus is believed to be highly transmissible and resistant to vaccines. But, a new study has claimed that the strain, which led the second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), is not able to evade the antibodies generated by vaccination.The study has been conducted by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in the United States and published in the journal Immunity.Delta was declared as the variant of concern by the World Health Organization (WHO).Why vaccinated people largely escaped the worst of Delta surge?The researchers analysed a panel of antibodies generated by people in response to Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine and found that Delta was unable to evade all but one of the antibodies they tested.Other variants of concern, such as Beta, avoided recognition and neutralisation by several of the antibodies, they said."The fact that Delta has outcompeted other variants does not mean that it's more resistant to our antibodies compared to other variants," said co-senior author Jacco Boon, an associate professor at Washington University.The researchThe health experts extracted antibody-producing cells from three people who had received the Pfizer vaccine.They grew the cells in the laboratory and obtained from them a set of 13 antibodies that target the original strain which began circulating last year.The researchers tested the antibodies against four variants of concern: Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta.Twelve of the 13 recognised Alpha and Delta, eight recognised all four variants, and one failed to recognise any of the four variants. Out of these, five antibodies neutralised the original strain."In face of vaccination, Delta is relatively a wimpy virus. If we had a variant that was more resistant like Beta but spread as easily as Delta, we would be in more trouble," Ellebedy said.The length and breadth of antibodiesIn previous studies, researchers have shown that both natural infection and vaccination elicit lasting antibody production.But this time, the group of scientists from Washington University noted that the length of the antibody response is only one aspect of protection, and breadth matters too.An ideal antibody response includes a diverse set of antibodies with the flexibility to recognise many slightly different variants of the virus, said the researchers.They added that breadth confers resilience, adding that even if a few antibodies lose the ability to recognise a new variant, other antibodies in the arsenal should remain capable of neutralising it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-vaccinated-people-largely-escaped-the-worst-of-delta-surge-study-explains-101629285593396.html
18-08-2021||World||Taliban to be judged on action, not words: UK PM Boris Johnson||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday said the new Taliban regime back in power in Afghanistan will be judged based on their actions and not words. The statement came a day after the Islamic militant outfit promised a peaceful rule following its complete takeover of the war-torn country on Sunday. The insurgents, known for their radical and regressive laws, also said they will respect their rights within the framework of Sharia law."We will judge this regime based on the choices it makes, and by its actions rather than by its words, on its attitude to terrorism, to crime and narcotics, as well as humanitarian access, and the rights of girls to receive an education," Johnson said in the British Parliament which resumed after a summer break to discuss the prevailing crisis in Afghanistan.Earlier in the day, Johnson spoke to his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan on the situation as part of a series of phone calls made with world leaders to push for a coordinated strategy to deal with an imminent humanitarian crisis. During the call, Johnson told Khan that any recognition of the new government in Afghanistan should happen on an "international, not unilateral" basis.The South-Asian nation has plunged into complete chaos after its Western-backed government collapsed following the withdrawal of US troops, two decades since it overthrew the repressive Taliban rule. With the Taliban seizing back power in the country and President Ashraf Ghani fleeing Afghanistan, world leaders are contemplating their stand on the Taliban regime as more and more images and stories of desperation emerge.On Monday, Russia said it will first observe the action of the new authorities closely, "only then it will make the decision", while the Chinese government has said it will form "friendly" relations with the Taliban regime.The head of the British Army also took a softer stance on the Taliban and said the world should give them the space to form a new government in Afghanistan and may discover that the insurgents cast as terrorists by the West for decades have become more reasonable. "We have to be patient, we have to hold our nerve and we have to give them the space to form a government and we have to give them the space to show their credentials," said Nick Carter in an interview with the BBC. "It may be that this Taliban is a different Taliban to the one that people remember from the 1990s," the chief of the defence staff added."But what we absolutely have to remember is that they are not a homogenous organisation - the Taliban is a group of disparate tribal figures that come from all over rural Afghanistan," Carter further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-to-be-judged-on-action-not-words-uk-pm-boris-johnson-101629284288063.html

The scheme includes providing refuge to 5,000 stranded Afghans in the first year alone, UK home secretary Priti Patel told BBC News. The development comes days after the Taliban's meteoric rise to power in Afghanistan.As the insurgents solidify control over the state apparatus, fear of conservative retribution has fueled a mass exodus of desperate and panicked residents who now flee the country apprehending the Taliban regime. According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), nearly 400,000 people were forced to leave their homes behind since the beginning of this year, joining 2.9 million Afghans already internally displaced across the country at the end of 2020."We owe a debt of gratitude to all those who have worked with us to make Afghanistan a better place over the last 20 years," said UK prime minister Boris Johnson. "Many of them, particularly women, are now in urgent need of our help."It is The Guardian that reports that women, children, and religious minorities will be prioritised in the Boris Johnson government's refugee resettlement scheme for stranded Afghans, adding that up to 20,000 people may resettle in the United Kingdom over a period of five years. However, citing a Whitehall source, the publication noted that most of these 20,000 people are likely to have fled to neighbouring countries such as Pakistan unless the UK can strike an agreement with the Taliban over the resettlement operations at the earliest.Ahead of launching the new resettlement scheme for Afghans, UK PM Boris Johnson had said that international partners need to come together to help prevent a humanitarian crisis.Notably, following the US withdrawal of troops in Afghanistan, the UK, too, had pulled its remaining troops out of the country. British soldiers are now working amid chaotic scenes in Kabul to help evacuate UK nationals and those Afghan citizens who worked for the British government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-announces-resettlement-plan-for-stranded-afghans-to-take-20-000-refugees-over-5-years-101629273082747.html

Reports have been emerging from Kabul and other cities about Taliban fighters beating up women and roaming around streets looking for ex-government workers.In one such incident, the insurgents killed a woman for being in public without a head covering, the New York Post reported.

18-08-2021||World||How Afghanistan's president went from hero to villain-in-hiding||If anyone was supposed to know how to fix Afghanistan, it was Ashraf Ghani.Before becoming president in 2014, Ghani spent much of his life studying how to boost growth in poor nations. A Fulbright Scholar with a doctorate from Columbia University, he taught at some of America’s elite academic institutions before stints at the World Bank and United Nations. Later he co-wrote “Fixing Failed States: A Framework for Rebuilding a Fractured World.”Now Ghani’s whereabouts are a mystery after he fled Afghanistan on Sunday. Reports have spotted him everywhere from Tajikistan to Oman to Abu Dhabi, with the Russians claiming he left with four cars and a helicopter full of cash. In Afghanistan he’s become a villain: his central bank chief and key members of his administration have denounced him publicly. Efforts to reach him or his close aides were unsuccessful.In many ways, Ghani’s swift downfall reflects the broader failures of the U.S. to impose a government on Afghanistan that had buy-in from a range of competing power brokers with a long history of fighting on the battlefield rather than at the ballot box. Although he was a Pashtun, the country’s dominant ethnic group, Ghani was seen as an outsider who lacked the political touch to unite disparate factions, and he became more isolated over time. “Ghani was not accommodating of the realities of how Afghanistan works,” said Kabir Taneja, author of “The ISIS Peril: The World’s Most Feared Terror Group and its Shadow on South Asia” and a fellow at Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. “He either didn’t understand or couldn’t understand the warlords, who are essentially people representing ethnic fault lines.” After the U.S. invasion in 2001, Ghani returned to Afghanistan for the first time in more than a quarter-century, and served for two years as finance minister in an administration led by Hamid Karzai. Afterward Ghani became a darling of the international aid world, giving Ted Talks, penning op-eds in major newspapers and speaking at conferences. At one point he was considered a candidate for UN secretary-general. Following a failed bid for the presidency in 2009, Ghani linked up with several prominent Afghan politicians -- including influential warlord-turned-vice president Abdul Rashid Dostum -- to win the top job five years later. But his victory was undermined from the start: John Kerry, then America’s top diplomat, flew to Kabul to broker a unity government that gave his main rival the position of “chief executive” -- a title that appears nowhere in Afghanistan’s U.S.-modeled constitution. In 2017, Ghani said he had “the worst job on earth” in an interview with the BBC. Still, he claimed that Afghan security forces had turned a corner against the Taliban and coalition forces would be able to leave by 2021. That turned out to be accurate, just not in the way he predicted. President Donald Trump’s administration started direct talks with the Taliban in a bid to end America’s longest war, and shut Ghani out of the process. Then this year, after President Joe Biden set a withdrawal deadline for Aug. 31, Ghani resisted calls to step aside and allow a transitional government to take power as the Taliban made military advances. “Ghani pretended to be for peace, but in reality he was in favor of war in order to remain in power even if it cost lives and pushed the Taliban to revert back to a military option,” said Omar Samad, former Afghan ambassador to Europe and fellow at Atlantic Council. “The delay tactics ruined the chances for a deal that would have removed him from office but would have paved the way for a broad-based transition.”‘I Will Not Flee!’As the Taliban descended on Kabul over the weekend, Ghani told the people that he would avoid the fate of former king Amanullah Khan, who abdicated and fled to British India in 1929. “I will not flee!” Ghani said at an event in Kabul on Aug. 4, raising his voice loudly. “I won’t seek safe haven and I will be at the service of people.”Yet as the Taliban blitzed across the country and marched to Kabul, Ghani appeared increasingly isolated. In a video released hours before he fled, Ghani called for the defense ministry to set up telephone helplines for citizens to call. ‘Treason’After leaving, Ghani released a Facebook post saying he exited the country to avoid bloodshed -- a move that infuriated his cabinet. “They tied out hands behind our backs and sold off the country,” Bismillah Mohammadi, Afghanistan’s acting defense minister, said on Twitter after Ghani fled. “Damn to Ghani and his team.”With Ghani nowhere to be found, former president Karzai and other Afghan politicians are now leading talks with the Taliban in Doha on setting up a new government. One thing they’ll easily agree on: Disdain for Ghani.“Ashraf Ghani has betrayed his own motherland, team and tribe,” Abdul Haq Hamad, a member of Taliban’s media team, told Afghanistan’s Tolo News. “Such treason will always be remembered.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-afghanistan-s-president-went-from-hero-to-villaininhiding-101629272021608.html

Reports said German Chancellor Angela Merkel and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have called up Imran Khan to discuss the situation in Afghanistan.Imran Khan has always opposed the presence of the US military in his neighbourhood and championed a compromise between Afghan authorities and the Taliban. On allegations of providing a safe haven to the Taliban in his country, he earlier said that the Taliban are not a military outfit that can be hunted down by the Pakistani army.The Taliban's unopposed accession to power in Afghanistan has paved way for a no-compromise government as reports said that the Taliban now want full control of the country. As the world is closely following the developments taking place in both Kabul and Doha. Canada has already said that it will not recognise the Taliban as the Afghan government. Boris Johnson on Sunday said nobody should bilaterally recognise the Taliban as the government of Afghanistan.Imran Khan has termed the Taliban takeover as "breaking the chains of slavery". "You take over the other culture and become psychologically subservient. When that happens, please remember, it is worse than actual slavery. It is harder to throw off the chains of cultural enslavement. What is happening in Afghanistan now, they have broken the shackles of slavery," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stay-engaged-to-support-afghans-imran-khan-s-message-to-global-leaders-101629268709066.html
18-08-2021||World||Under fire over withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, Joe Biden's 2010 statement surfaces||United States President Joe Biden is facing a major backlash, including from his NATO allies for not doing enough to prevent the humanitarian crisis triggered by the troops' pullout after two decades of war. The country is now under the siege of the Taliban, which is likely to impose radical Islamic law and experts fear that they will turn the country into the safe haven of terrorist activities.In the backdrop of this embroiling crisis, a statement made by Biden is making headlines in which he seems to be in favour of the withdrawal of US troops from the war-torn country. According to a report by the Atlantic, Richard Holbrooke who was a special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan in the Obama administration in 2010, asked Biden whether the US has a moral obligation to remain in Afghanistan to protect its residents. To this, the then vice-president responded, saying "F--- that, we don’t have to worry about that. We did it in Vietnam, Nixon and Kissinger got away with it. The news outlet cited Holbrooke's diary as the source of the statement.During the Vietnam war, the US sent its troops to defend South Vietnam in 1955. For the next nearly 20 years, the forces stayed there and fought with the North Vietnam forces. The war eventually ended after the US troops were forced to leave South Vietnam following the capture of Saigon, now known as Ho Chi Minh City, by North Vietnam’s forces.After this, the US forces carried out evacuations, similar to the ones it is now carrying out in Afghanistan following the Taliban military takeover of the capital city Kabul.The US entered Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks for "war on terror" and ousted the Taliban from the country. Since then the US troops have stayed in the South Asian nation to help in anti-terror operations.Taliban returned to rule this week after a lightning offensive as US-led Western forces withdrew under a deal that included a promise by the insurgent group not to attack them as they leave.The plan to withdraw from Afghanistan was announced by former US President Donald Trump. After taking over the office this year, President Joe Biden continued with the plan and announced that the last troops would leave by the end of August.On Tuesday, rejecting the criticism over the fallout, Biden said he stands behind the decision to leave the country. He also assured to evacuate thousands of Afghans from the country, while also pinned the blame for the fallout on the Afghanistan government. In his address from the White House, Biden said that he had warned Ashraf Ghani — who was appointed Afghanistan's president in a US-negotiated agreement — to be prepared to fight a civil war with the Taliban after American forces leave the country. "They failed to do any of that," Biden also said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/under-fire-over-withdrawal-of-us-troops-from-afghanistan-biden-s-2010-statement-surfaces-101629269120145.html

Los Angeles Times reporter Marcus Yam posted some of the pictures on Twitter on Wednesday and claimed in accompanying text that at least half dozen were wounded, including a woman and her child.*GRAPHIC WARNING* Taliban fighters use gunfire, whips, sticks and sharp objects to maintain crowd control over thousands of Afghans who continue to wait for a way out, on airport road. At least half dozen were wounded while I was there, including a woman and her child. #Kabul pic.twitter.com/a2KzNPx07RFox News obtained a video, which it claims shows Taliban fighters roaming around the streets of Kabul and other places and opening fire while looking for ex-government workers. The channel also reported about an incident in Takhar province where a woman was killed by Taliban fighters on Tuesday for being in public without a head covering.CNN carried a report which had chilling details about thrashing of a woman in Faryab province in July. The fighters knocked on the door of Najia, in a remote village, and asked her to cook food for 15 fighters, the CNN report said. When she told the Taliban fighters that she is poor and won't be able to cook food, they started beating her with their AK-47 rifles, threw a grenade in the next room and fled as the flames spread. The report was based on the account given by Najia's daughter Manizha.Last week, the United Nations claimed that more than 1,000 civilians had been killed by the Taliban and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said that since August 1, some 4,042 wounded people had been treated at 15 health facilities.Though the Taliban have denied targeting and killing civilians during their offensive against Afghan government troops, the United States government has refuted the claims.The Taliban, fighting since their 2001 ouster to expel foreign forces, seized Kabul on Sunday after a lightning offensive as US-led Western withdrew under a deal that included a promise from the insurgents not to attack them as they leave.In their first news briefing since capturing Kabul, the Taliban suggested they would impose their laws more softly than during their earlier time in power, between 1996-2001."We don't want any internal or external enemies," Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban's main spokesman, told reporters.Women would be allowed to work and study and "will be very active in society but within the framework of Islam", he said.But many women have expressed skepticism. "They have to walk the talk. Right now they are not doing that," Pashtana Durrani, 23, an Afghan girls' education activist, told news agency Reuters.Local media reports have said that several women were ordered to leave their jobs during the Taliban's rapid advance across Afghanistan.During their previous rule, also guided by sharia religious law, the Taliban had stopped women from working. Girls were not allowed to go to school and women had to wear all-enveloping burqas to go out and then only when accompanied by a male relative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-attack-women-children-at-kabul-airport-despite-peace-promise-report-101629267994723.html

18-08-2021||World||Canada polls: All parties say Taliban-led Afghan govt won’t be recognised||Regardless of who forms the next government, there is unanimity among Canada’s major Federal parties that the Taliban regime will not be recognised as the Government of Afghanistan.This position was stated by Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau, also the caretaker Prime Minister, as he told reporters during a campaign event in Markham, Ontario: “Canada has no plans to recognise Taliban as the Government of Afghanistan.” That position has also been maintained by other leaders. Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole was also categorical on this point, as he tweeted, “I was asked by a caller if I would recognise the legitimacy of the Taliban in Afghanistan. Let me be clear: never.” The New Democratic Party has taken the same stand.Trudeau also pointed out that the Taliban “are a recognised terrorist organisation under Canadian law” and had “taken over and replaced the duly elected, democratic government by force.”But as campaigning for the Federal elections on September 20 continues, fears have been expressed that it will adversely impact Canada’s response to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan after the Trudeau government’s initial tardy reaction led to a delayed announcement that 20,000 Afghans will be taken in as part of special immigration programme.Among the critics is Ottawa-based Dr Nipa Banerjee, who headed Canada’s aid programme in Afghanistan between 2003 and 2006. Responsible ministers, she said, will be busy with safeguarding their political futures rather than focusing fully on the matter, though that needs to be addressed urgently. “The election will have an impact on what we can do in Afghanistan,” Banerjee, who regularly returned to Afghanistan twice a year till recently said Canada’s response has been “chaotic and not organised”. “People who worked on our development programmes, they have not even been considered. I know a lot of people who are there and they are saying they wanted to get out. But the Canadian government has done nothing. They are as much as exposed as military people. It’s obvious to me, these people are not even considered.”Banerjee, currently a senior fellow at the University of Ottawa’s School of International Development and Global Studies, said she heard regularly from these former associates, who are panic-stricken. She said she heard from them that many filled an online form for the special immigration programme, but have “not received any answer”.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-not-to-recognise-taliban-led-afghan-govt-trudeau-101629262417820.html

The risk of new fires has also been increased as the state is bracing for an early-season wind storm that could send flames burning out of control.According to the forecast of the National Weather Service of the country, the wind speed is likely to become 35mph as it issued red flag warnings for several states in the western region.On Tuesday, the Caldore fire which erupted over the weekend spread through the small rural town of Grizzly flats as it tripled in size between Monday and Tuesday afternoon to nearly 50 square miles (129 square kilometres). The fast-moving Caldore fire has injured at least two people and burned around 50 homes in and around Grizzly Flats so far, according to the news agency AP report.To the north, the Dixie Fire — the largest of some 100 active wildfires in more than a dozen Western states — was advancing toward Susanville, population about 18,000.Wildfires are common in California, but over the last few years, California is seeing more and more wildfires and the intensity of these flames is just increasing every year.Why?There are four key reasons that that state suffers from the most destructive fires in the country. The first is California is already a dry state. The land in California gets most of its moisture in the fall season which is dried out by the spring vegetation. Hence, the state experience the never-ending dry season, which essentially fuels the wildfires.The second is climate change, which has made the west part of the US warmer and drier in the past 30 years and, according to experts, this will continue to make the weather more extreme and wildfires more destructive.Another factor is California's large population. Many people are not moving towards the forested areas of the state, where a spark caused by campfires, parties becomes out of control.Lastly, California is vulnerable to fires due to Santa Ana winds that dry out the vegetation and fuel embers snowball into larger blazes.According to a report by the New York Times, fires caused by Santa Ana winds spread three times faster and burn closer to urban areas. They were responsible for 80% of the economic losses over two decades beginning in 1990, according to the report.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-change-dry-weather-why-california-burns-every-year-101629261688906.html
18-08-2021||World||Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar returns to Afghanistan after 20 years. Who is he?||Abdul Ghani Baradar, the co-founder of the Taliban, and now the undisputed victor of the Afghanistan war, is back in the country after 20 years. In 2001, he was ousted from Afghanistan and the Taliban leadership on Tuesday claimed that he has arrived at Kandahar from Qatar. Abdul Ghani Baradar, as the most public face of the Taliban, is likely to become the new President, reports said. Though Haibatullah Akhundzada is the overall leader of the outfit, Abdul Ghani Baradar has remained the face of the Taliban and his return to the country with the fall of Kabul indicates mobilisation to form the new government.Also Read: As Taliban take control of Afghanistan, a look at who's who of the leadershipHere are 10 things you need to know about Abdul Ghani Baradar1. He was born in 1968, in Uruzgan province of Afghanistan. He fought in the Afghan Mujahideen against the Soviets in the 1980s.2. In 1989, after the Soviets left and the country was torn in civil war, Baradar set up a madrassa in Kandahar with Mohammad Omar. The duo then launched the Taliban movement in 1994 and came to power in 1996. The two men reportedly became brothers-in-law after Baradar married Mullah Omar's sister.3. He became the deputy minister of defence during the last regime of the Taliban and then following US intervention, he was banished. Pakistan, Saudia Arabia and the UAE had only recognised the Taliban rule.4. Baradar was arrested by Pakistani authorities from Karachi in 2010 and was in Pakistan custody.5. In 2018, at the request of the United States, Baradar was released from Pakistan and was relocated to Doha.6. In February 2020, Baradar signed the Doha agreement with the United States.7. Then US President Donald Trump had spoken to Baradar on the Afghanistan peace process.8. Baradar led the nine-member Taliban delegation that was hosted by China in July 2021. China termed the Afghan Taliban as an important military and political force in the country.9. Reports said Baradar had understood from the five-year regime that the Taliban had to increase popular support and that's why he, in 2009, ordered Taliban foot soldiers to carry a small handbook on how to win the hearts and minds of villagers. This "code of conduct" focussed on reducing civilian casualties.10. After Sunday's bloodless coup, Baradar issued a message for Taliban fighters and said that the challenge just began as the Taliban would have to govern the country. Some reports said he was present in Kabul, negotiation with Ashraf Ghani, but Taliban spokespersons said he was in Qatar at that time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mullah-abdul-ghani-baradar-returns-to-afghanistan-after-20-years-who-is-he-101629261443178.html
18-08-2021||World||Experts remain sceptical as Taliban promise to 'protect' women, children rights||Afghanistan was thrown into disarray this week as the Taliban seized control of power in aftermath of the troops' pullout by the United States and NATO. The group declared victory over the government as the group entered the already abandoned presidential palace on Sunday after President Ashraf Ghani fled the country with his key staff.The military takeover has triggered a massive panic across Afghans leading to a mass exodus from the country. Residents fear that the insurgents will reimpose their radical and brutal policies that prevailed from 1996 to 2001.Also Read | Moderate Taliban is an oxymoronDuring their rule, imposed Sharia Islamic law under which the group executed people publicly for crimes as small as theft. The women were required to be covered all the time in the traditional burqa. The group also restricted women to study. While men were forced to grow beards. The group was eventually thrown out of power after US forces entered the country for anti-terrorist operations following the 9/11 attack.However, the Taliban this time have promised to rule differently and more moderately. On Tuesday, in a first press conference since the military takeover of the capital, the group pledged to protect the rights of women and minorities. Responding to a question by a journalist on what will be different this time that their previous rule, the Taliban spokesperson said the group has a different perspective now. "The ideology and beliefs are the same because they're Muslims, but there is a change in terms of experience--they're more experienced and have a different perspective," the spokesperson said at the media interactions.Experts are still sceptical of the situation that will follow after the group reaches a settlement through which the group plans to establish an Islamic government in the country"The Taliban has never renounced violence, it has not moderated its draconian views on justice and women, and it is allied with international terrorists," news agency ANI quoted US scholar Michael Kugelman as saying. Mohammed Soliman, Scholar at the Middle East Institute in Washington, also believes that the social and civil rights "arena is foggier".Also Read | Old video of Taliban fighters laughing about women politicians goes viralThere are also signs from the ground that paints a different picture than what the Taliban promises. Multiple reports have emerged since the Taliban offensive claiming that the group killed women for not covering their heads. On August 1, a 21-year-old woman was reportedly shot dead by the Taliban for not wearing a veil. Reports suggested that the woman was on her way to Balkh district centre when she was dragged out of a car and killed by the Taliban.According to a report by Al-Jazeera, the group also sent several women working banks home and told them that their male relatives can takeover their work.On Monday, United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres expressed concerns regarding the human rights violations and said he has been "receiving chilling reports of severe restrictions on human rights" throughout the country. "I am particularly concerned by accounts of mounting human rights violations against the women and girls of Afghanistan," he said at an emergency meeting of the Security Council.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/experts-remain-sceptical-as-taliban-promise-to-protect-women-children-rights-101629261110284.html
18-08-2021||World||Moderate Taliban is an oxymoron||Delivering a lecture a month after 9/11 attacks, Jaswant Singh, then external affairs minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee's cabinet, described a moderate Taliban an oxymoron. Two decades later, after US and allied forces literally ran away from Afghanistan leaving Kabul to the mercy of ultra conservative UN designated terrorist group, the debate has again started on moderate Taliban after its spokesperson promised to fully implement more than a 1000-year-old Islamic Sharia code under the new Emirates of Afghanistan. The assurances of the Taliban spokesperson are hardly of any value to Afghanistan watchers as the Sunni Pashtun group was planning a pincer attack on Kabul while talking about a so-called negotiated settlement in Doha, Qatar. Fact is that the Taliban, under the smokescreen of talks, was allowed to make a fool out of Americans (all thanks to Zalmay Khalilzad) and the Sunni group is in no mood to share spoils of its victory with anyone.When the Taliban last captured Kabul in 1996, there was a power vacuum in Afghanistan with the Soviets running away with their tails firmly tucked between their legs and the West led by the US in retreat mode as their objective had been achieved. The situation on August 15, 2021 was no different. Only this time the US ran away from Kabul and so did its appointee Ashraf Ghani and anti-US forces like China, Russia, Iran and Turkey are all breathing a sigh of relief as America is no longer patrolling their backyard. However, what has changed is that the Taliban, after showing tremendous resilience and motivation for two decades, have come out much stronger this time with even north Afghanistan under its control and powers like China and Russia unilaterally offering to smoke the peace pipe. Of course, the principal role of Pakistani deep state and Taliban Deobandi ideological brothers like Jaish-e-Mohammad and Tehreek-e-Taliban cannot be forgotten in nourishing the Sunni terrorist group. All the talk of the Afghan led-Afghan owned peace process has been consigned to the pathetic dustbin of history.With a force of over 75,000 hardline cadre and top of the line US weapons surrendered by pusillanimous 300,000 Afghan Army personnel, the Taliban are really not looking for recognition from the democratic world as they now have territory to rule and enforce the Islamic law. Last time, mother Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and UAE recognised the Taliban, this time the number led by China, Russia, Iran and Turkey will be much higher.Under the circumstances, India is in no hurry to take a position on Taliban even if the US is looking for an excuse of a negotiated settlement to recognise the radicalised Sunni force. After all, the US invaded Afghanistan to get rid of Al-Qaeda led by Osama bin Laden not the Taliban. And withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan was first proposed by Democrat President Barack Obama in his 2011 way forward speech with the support of his then Vice President Joe Biden.For “India First” Narendra Modi government, the parameters of engaging the Taliban are based on its relationship with Pakistan and Pakistan-based Deobandi terrorist groups with India in their cross-hairs. There is also a serious incoming internal security threat to India as the victorious Taliban will be the galvanizing force for the Ummah, leading to increased global radicalisation as witnessed when the so-called Islamic State captured Mosul in 2014. Today, the Taliban have become the beacon of political Islam and will attract followers from all over the world.While for the time-being it is a win-win situation for the Taliban, this may not be so in the coming months after reality of the Sunni Pashtun group dawns on the minorities. One must remember that 40 per cent of the Afghan army was of Tajik ethnicity and they may take to weapons under the leadership of young Ahmed Massoud and Amrullah Saleh, provided the two survive the Taliban onslaught on Panjshir Valley. Historically, the military situation in Afghanistan is known to change at the drop of a dime or dollar.While the Taliban have traditionally maintained that they have no interest in Kashmir issue and has always rejected the Durand Line, India is waiting on whether the Sunni Islamist force, which draws inspiration from Wahhabism as Deoband does, cuts a deal with TTP in favour of Pakistan Army. TTP leader Mufti Noor Wali Mehsud has already made it clear that it will continue to fight Pakistan Army while thanking Haibatullah Akundzada for releasing their deputy leader Maulvi Faqir Mohammed from Bagram highest security prison. No less than 7,000 hardcore and most brutal terrorists were let go by the Taliban from Bagram prison and the US will have to answer for future terror attacks. It will become clear to India on Pakistan’s leverage on the Afghan Taliban if they try to get their Pakistan namesake on the peace table for Rawalpindi GHQ.The other issue being watched by Indian counter-terrorism experts is the relationship between the Taliban and Bhawalpur based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) group, which has vowed to target India on Kashmir. One must remember that Jaish Emir Maulana Masood Azhar was taken directly to Emir-ul-Momeen Mullah Omar after he was freed by India in the 1999 IC-814 hijacking at Kandahar. The Taliban have no love lost for Ahle-Hadith Lashkar-e-Tayebba group and are now low on priority of the Pakistani ISI.If Taliban have no overt interest in Kashmir, then they will not supply top of the line US made weapons, drones and military vehicles or provide terror training camps to Azhar gang in Afghanistan for targeting India. If India is targeted under the umbrella of Taliban despite their public and private assurances, then the next Balakot will be in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderate-taliban-is-an-oxymoron-101629259821847.html

With the evacuation operations at the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul accelerating, several US lawmakers across the political spectrum are now imploring the president to keep US forces in Afghanistan until the time they finish evacuating every single US citizen and Afghan allies fleeing the Taliban. More than 40 lawmakers from the US House of Representatives issued a letter to President Biden on Tuesday, in which they requested him to extend the August 31 deadline that was earlier imposed for the military mission.Also Read | Implications of US move for the world“The United States must do everything possible to securely hold the airport in Kabul until the rescue mission is complete and our citizens, allies, and vulnerable Afghans have had an opportunity to leave,” the letter read. "We trust that the previous August 31st deadline you imposed on our military mission will not apply to this effort and that we will stay as long as is necessary to complete it."The letter was commissioned under the leadership of Democratic Representatives Tom Malinowski of New Jersey and Jason Crow of Colorado but also includes long-time war critics alongside GOP hawks, along with many lawmakers who have served in Afghanistan. According to the Bloomberg news agency, the bipartisan push from the US lawmakers on the Afghanistan issue "underscores the growing unease on Capitol Hill about the United States’ messy withdrawal amid the Taliban’s rapid rise in the country."Also Read | Moderate Taliban is an oxymoronOthers who signed the letter include Democrats who have long agitated to end the Afghan conflict, including Barbara Lee of California, the only lawmaker to vote against the war authorization in 2001, Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, and Pramila Jayapal of Washington. They are joined by Elise Stefanik of New York, the third-ranking House Republican, and Dan Crenshaw of Texas among other GOP House members.Although Pentagon officials have not confirmed that the military drawdown deadline will be extended, they said on Wednesday that troops would hold the Kabul airport until the end of the month to evacuate as many as possible. In case the deadline is extended, the order must come straight from President Joe Biden.“The mission runs through August 31st,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters. “The commander in chief made it very clear that we were to complete this drawdown by August 31st.” He added that the Pentagon is aiming to fly planes out every hour with the goal of airlifting between 5,000 and 9,000 people a day.There are still 11,000 “self-identified” US citizens in Afghanistan, according to White House press secretary Jen Psaki.

Citing local media reports, the PTI news agency reported that the Pakistani TikToker lodged an FIR in this regard, where she complained that people tore her clothes during the chaos and kept throwing her into the air while she and her companions attempted to escape the mob. She also alleged that her ring and earrings were "forcibly taken" by unidentified people in the crowd, while the mobile phone and identity card of one of her companions, along with a sum of about 15,000 PKR, were also "snatched".A video of the incident has gone viral on social media, with netizens seeking to identify the men spotted in the video and calling for legal action to be initiated against them. On its part though, the Lahore police have registered a case against hundreds of unidentified persons for assaulting and stealing from the TikToker woman.The incident took place at the Greater Iqbal Park area in Lahore on Independence Day, according to the First Information Report (FIR) registered at the Lorry Adda police station in the city. As per the complaint, the TikToker and six of her companions were filming a video near Minar-e-Pakistan on August 14, marked as Independence Day in the country, when around 300 to 400 people "attacked" them."The crowd was huge and people were scaling the enclosure and coming towards us," the woman wrote in her complaint at the police station.

As the insurgents, now in control of the country, solidify their rule, a gut-wrenching visual reportedly emerging from the Kabul airport on August 17 has rattled global humanitarian watchdogs. The photograph, which was posted by the Aśvaka news agency on Twitter, shows an infant who was reportedly separated from parents during the chaos at Kabul airport. The child, who according to the agency is no older than seven months, is now waiting to be united with parents with the help of authorities issuing missing announcements on social media."A couple living in PD-5 Kabul blame that their 7 months' baby went missing from Kabul Airport yesterday during the chaos," the news agency posted from its official handle on Twitter. "Up to this instance, they couldn't find him. The Aśvaka news agency is trying to help them find their baby through missing announcements on social media."A couple living in PD-5 #Kabul blame that their 7 Months Baby went missing from Kabul Airport yesterday during the chaos.

While netizens expressed their anguish at the Taliban for the fate of the seven-month-old infant along with many others who saw their lives come down to ruin with the Taliban offensive, several Twitter users also came out with scathing remarks against international agencies as well as the United States for allowing such a situation to unfold.Several horrific visuals have emerged from Afghanistan's capital Kabul since the Taliban took control. While a video showed hundreds surrounding a taxiing aircraft at the Hamid Karzai International Airport, another showed the true desperation, sadness, and panic of citizens as they tried to board the last flights leaving Kabul before the airport was shut.Perhaps the most haunting visual to emerge from the Kabul chaos was of two persons, who were clinging to an aircraft in desperation to flee the country, falling from the sky after losing grip mid-air.Meanwhile, more than 2,200 students of Afghan-origin studying in India on scholarship stare at an uncertain future with the Taliban seizing control of Afghanistan that has forced thousands to either flee or seek evacuation from the country. The Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR), a nodal agency for international students that promotes cultural exchange with other countries by formulating and implementing policies and programmes, has also been receiving requests from students in Afghanistan for expediting their visas to permit entry into India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sevenmonthold-infant-separated-from-parents-during-chaos-at-kabul-airport-photo-goes-viral-101629245920892.html
18-08-2021||World||Death toll from Haiti's weekend earthquake rises to 1,941||Haitian officials raised the death toll from a deadly weekend earthquake by more than 500 on Tuesday after Tropical Storm Grace forced a temporary halt to search and rescue efforts, a delay that fed growing anger and frustration among thousands who were left homeless.Grace battered southwestern Haiti, which was hit hardest by Saturday's quake, and officials warned some areas could get 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain before the storm moved on. Intermittent rain fell in the earthquake-damaged city of Les Cayes and in the capital of Port-au-Prince.Late Tuesday afternoon, the Civil Protection Agency raised the death toll to 1,941 and the number of injured to 9,900, many of whom have had to wait for medical help lying outside in wilting heat.The devastation is centered in the country’s southwestern area, where health care has reached capacity and people have lost homes and loved ones.Patience was running out in the Western Hemisphere’s poorest nation. Haitians already were struggling with the coronavirus, gang violence, worsening poverty and the July 7 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse when the quake hit.Bodies continued to be pulled from the rubble, and the smell of death hung heavily over a pancaked, three-story apartment building. A simple bed sheet covered the body of a 3-year-old girl that firefighters had found an hour earlier.Neighbor Joseph Boyer, 53, said he knew the girl's family.“The mother and father are in the hospital, but all three kids died,” he said. The bodies of the other two siblings were found earlier.Illustrating the lack of government presence, volunteer firefighters from the nearby city of Cap-Hatien had left the body out in the rain because police have to be present before a body can be taken away.Another neighbor, James Luxama, 24, repeated a popular rumor at many disaster scenes, saying that someone was sending text messages for help from inside the rubble. But Luxama had not personally seen or received such a message.A throng of angry, shouting men gathered in front of the collapsed building, a sign that patience was running out for people who have waited days for help from the government.“The photographers come through, the press, but we have no tarps for our roofs,” said one man, who refused to give his name.The head of Haiti’s office of civil protection, Jerry Chandler, acknowledged the situation. Earthquake assessments had to be paused because of the heavy rain, “and people are getting aggressive,” Chandler said Tuesday.Some children were orphaned in the quake and some youngsters were starting to go hungry, said Carl-Henry Petit-Frère, a field manager for Save the Children, which said in a statement that it was distributing what it could to people living on the streets without protection from the wind and rain.“I see children crying on the street, people asking us for food, but we are low on food ourselves as well," Petit-Frère said, adding that children were warned not to go into houses because they could collapse. “The organizations that are here are doing what they can, but we need more supplies. Food, clean water and shelter are needed most, and we need them fast.”About 20 soldiers finally showed up to help rescuers at the collapsed apartment building.Prior to that, the only help that arrived was from poorly equipped volunteers.“All we have are sledgehammers and hands. That’s the plan,” said Canadian volunteer Randy Lodder, director of the Adoration Christian School in Haiti.Sarah Charles, assistant administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, said its disaster response teams were forced to suspend operations as the storm arrived Monday, but members were back Tuesday to assess its impact and continue helping.“We do not anticipate that the death toll related to this earthquake will be anywhere near the 2010 earthquake, where more than 200,000 people were killed,” Charles told reporters.The scale of the damage also was not as severe as that earthquake, she said, adding: “That’s not what we’re seeing on the ground right now.”In a statement, the U.S. military's Southern Command said it was moving eight helicopters from Honduras to Haiti and that seven U.S. Coast Guard cutters were en route to support the USAID team. Two cutters already are there along with two Coast Guard helicopters and U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon aircraft that are taking aerial images of earthquake devastated areas, the statement said.The effort was being mounted “to provide the kind of emergency response that is necessary in a human tragedy and catastrophe like this,” U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House.John Morrison, public information officer for the Fairfax Co. (Virginia) Urban Search and Rescue, said its team was still trying to find survivors. Two U.S. Coast Guard helicopters had ferried searchers to six stricken communities on Monday.“The team reports that food, health care services, safe drinking water, hygiene and sanitation and shelter are all priority needs,” Morrison said. He added that the team had not seen any signs of people trapped alive in buildings.The rain and wind raised the threat of mudslides and flash flooding as Grace slowly passed over southwestern Haiti's Tiburon Peninsula before heading toward Jamaica and southeastern Cuba. Forecasters said it could become a hurricane before hitting Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.Officials said the magnitude 7.2 earthquake destroyed more than 7,000 homes and damaged nearly 5,000, leaving about 30,000 families homeless. Hospitals, schools, offices and churches also were demolished or badly damaged.In the village of Bonne Fin, a one-hour drive from from Les Cayes on dirt roads, the mountaintop Hospital Lumiere illustrated the anguish and complexity of Haiti’s medical crisis and dire need for outside help.No one died or was injured at the hospital when the quake hit, but the operating rooms partially collapsed.Through cracks in a wall, Dr. Frantz Codio could see three glistening anesthesia machines he needed to perform orthopedic operations on broken bones. But he could not get to them because the building's cement floor was leaning at a crazy angle — in some places just 3 or 4 feet (0.9 meters to 1.2 meters) above where it used to be.Despite warnings not to go inside the structure, Codio did so on Sunday and pulled one of the machines out.“People said, ‘Don’t go in there, it’s too dangerous,’ but I had God with me,” Codio said.Etzer Emile, a Haitian economist and professor at Quisqueya University, a private institution in Port-au-Prince, said the earthquake will almost certainly result in more long-term poverty for Haiti’s struggling southwestern region.Political instability and gang criminality along the southern roads into the region have particularly hobbled economic activity in recent years.“The earthquake has just given a fatal blow to a regional economy already on its knees for about 2 1/2 years,” Emile said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-from-haiti-s-weekend-earthquake-rises-to-1941-101629245761353.html

The message sent through the address is that Taliban 2.0 is dovish and conciliatory. Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid addressed the conference and reiterated that there will be no execution and punishment -- hallmarks of the Taliban's previous time in power two decades ago.Here's what the Taliban said:No revenge: Taliban would not seek retribution against former soldiers and government officials, and would grant an amnesty for former soldiers as well as contractors and translators who worked for international forces. "All those in the opposite side are pardoned from A to Z. We will not seek revenge," the spokesperson said.Taliban 1.0 and Taliban 2.0: If the question is based on ideology, and beliefs, there is no difference between Taliban during 1996 and 2001, but if calculated on experience, maturity, and insight, no doubt there are many differences.Women rights: Women would be allowed to work and study and "will be very active in society but within the framework of Islam.International relations: Taliban don't want to repeat any conflict, any war again, and they want to do away with the factors for conflict. "Taliban would not allow Afghanistan to be used as a base for attacking other countries, as it was in the years before 9/11," the spokesperson said.Press freedom: "We will respect freedom of the press because media reporting will be useful to society and will be able to help correct the leaders' errors. Journalists working for state or privately-owned media are not criminals and none of them will be prosecuted. In our view, these journalists are civilians and moreover, are talented young people who constitute our richness," the spokesperson said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/womens-rights-under-islamic-law-to-amnesty-what-taliban-said-in-1st-address-101629245433146.html

But certainly, a fair amount of it has fallen into the hands of the Taliban," said White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan."Obviously, we don't have a sense that they are going to readily hand it over to us," he said.Sullivan said losing control of millions of dollars worth of military supplies to an enemy is an example of "the difficult choices a president faces ... in the context of the end of a 20-year war."He noted that the Black Hawks had been supplied to Afghan government forces to help battle the Taliban insurgency.But the government forces succumbed to the Islamist insurgents quickly, and gave up control of large stores of weaponry and their helicopters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-gained-fair-amount-of-us-defense-equipment-white-house-101629244966216.html

Not only do we want to lead by example, we cannot do this alone," she wrote.As the situation rapidly changed over the last few days, it has been difficult to evacuate people stuck in other parts of Afghanistan where there is no access to an airport or a third country."The complex picture on the ground means there will be significant challenges delivering the scheme, but the government is working at speed to address these obstacles," the Home Office said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-plans-to-welcome-thousands-of-afghans-in-new-refugee-plan-101629243701901.html
