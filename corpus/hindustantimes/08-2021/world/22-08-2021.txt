Johnson - leader of the closest US ally - had requested to speak to Biden on Sunday, but did not get a call back until Tuesday. He has since been grilled by British lawmakers in parliament - “faced a wall of fury”, as The Guardian put it - which also condemned Biden’s decision in the sharpest terms.The Financial Times reported that British defence secretary Ben Wallace had appeared on the verge of tears on Monday as he said that “some would not get back” from the war-torn country. “It’s sad. Twenty years of sacrifice is what it is,” he added. Wallace had tried earlier in the year to put together a coalition of countries to keep some troops in Afghanistan.In a call on Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron “underscored the absolute need for swift, concrete coordination between the allies to ensure the evacuation of our citizens, Afghan men and women who worked for the allies, and those who are in danger”, according to this office.“The head of state emphasised our collective moral responsibility towards the Afghan men and women who need our protection and who share our values. We cannot abandon them,” the office added.The White House readout of the same call did not mention the phrase or reflect that sentiment.And German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s successor Amin Laschet has called the pullout the “the greatest debacle that Nato has experienced since its foundation”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-meet-g7-leaders-amidst-growing-afghan-fissures-101629654018888.html

The regime first ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 after which it was driven away by the US-led forces who arrived here after the 9/11 attacks. However, in April this year, US president Joe Biden announced he will recall all American troops from Afghanistan by August 31.

Explaining the vision of the Anti-Taliban force, Massoud said the Panjshir resistance does not want bloodshed and war and believes that negotiation with the Taliban will be the only way out.'Panjshir won't surrender'As reiterated by other Resistance leaders, Massoud once again said on Sunday that Panjshir, which has never surrendered to anyone, will not give in to the Taliban as well. But if the Taliban do not agree to dialogue, then war will be unavoidable.'Not a fight for Panjshir'Massoud told Reuters that the Resistance force is not only fighting for the Panjshir province. Forces have come from various provinces to Panjshir and they are defending the whole country in one province. Massoud told Reuters that he has a mixture of forces from regular army units and special forces as well as the local militia.'No problem with Taliban in government'Dubai's Al-Arabiya television channel quoted Massoud as saying that he has no problem with a government in which the Taliban participate. But a Taliban government will be a totalitarian regime, which should not be recognised by the international community. An inclusive, broad-based government in Kabul representing Afghanistan's different ethnic groups is what he pitched for.This is the first time after the fall of Kabul that Massoud gave interviews regarding the future plan of the National Resistance Front. On August 18, he wrote an opinion for the Washington Post calling the international help. In his appeal to all countries, including the United States which withdrew its troops from Afghanistan, the United Kingdom, Massoud wrote that the Taliban is not a problem of the Afghans alone as Afghanistan under Taliban will become "ground zero of radical Islamist terrorism".32-year-old Massoud had spent years in exile in Iran and Britain. He attended his school in Iran and then studied in the United Kingdom. After spending a year on a military course at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst he pursued a bachelor degree in War Studies at King's College London and then studied international politics at the University of London. In 2016, he returned to Afghanistan.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/do-not-want-war-what-massoud-said-on-panjshir-resistance-deal-with-taliban-101629650481962.html

22-08-2021||World||Which countries are taking in Afghan refugees and which countries are not?||The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan has resulted in a human catastrophe as it has triggered a mass exodus of Afghan people who are desperate to flee the clutches of the Taliban. But where will they go? On Sunday, Russia and Austria have made it clear that they don't want Afghan refugees for various reasons. Some countries are accepting Afghan refugees while some are weighing their options and are not too keen to expand their refugee programmes.Pakistan and Iran have taken in the maximum number of Afghan refugees and asylum seekers in 2020, reports said. They are followed by Germany, Turkey, Austria, France, Greece, Sweden, Switzerland, India, Italy, UK etc.List of countries that are accepting Afghan refugeesThe United States will accept people from Afghanistan who have previously worked with the government. Reports said these Afghans will be temporarily sheltered in Albania, Kosovo or northern Macedonia, the three Balkan countries in Europe which have opened their doors to Afghan refugees.United Kingdom: The United Kingdom said it can take up to 20,000 Afghans over the long term with priority given to women, children and those facing persecution.Australia: Australia has plans to provide at least 3,000 visas to Afghans over a year. It will not allow thousands of Afghans inside the country, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said. "I note that some are talking about figures of 20,000 but can I tell you there are no clear plans about that. Australia is not going into that territory," he said.Tajikistan: In July, Tajikistan said it was ready to take in up to one lakh Afghan refugees.Canada: Around 20,000 Afghan refugees have already fled to Canada.Germany: Angela Merkel has told her party that the country needs to take in about 10,000 Afghans who are at risk.India: India is committed to evacuating Hindus and Sikhs who want to come to India. It has introduced a new category of e-visa, which will be valid for six months, as of now.Iran: Reports said Iran has set up emergency tents for refugees in three provinces that border Afghanistan.Pakistan: Pakistan said it would seal its border with Afghanistan but so far Afghans have been allowed to cross over to Pakistan.Countries with a conservative stance on taking in Afghan refugeesTurkeyReports said Turkey is reinforcing its border with Iran to stop a potential influx of fleeing Afghans. Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said that Turkey will not become Europe's "refugee warehouse".AustriaAustria’s government said it won’t accept asylum seekers fleeing the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan and will instead focus on assisting them locally. “I am clearly against voluntarily accepting more people,” Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said, according to excerpts of an interview published by broadcaster Puls 24. “That won’t happen on my watch.”RussiaRussia has said that it does not want Afghan militants arriving under the cover of refugees.FranceEmmanuel Macron said France will protect those who are in danger but at the same time he pointed out that Europe has to protect itself from "significant waves of illegal migrants".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/which-countries-are-taking-in-afghan-refugees-and-which-countries-are-not-101629646800845.html
22-08-2021||World||'Better' face masks can mitigate spread of Covid-19 indoors: Study||A study conducted at Canada’s University of Waterloo has concluded that widespread use of “better” face masks is needed to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in closed spaces, according to news agency ANI. For the exercise, engineering researchers used a mannequin which simulated a seated person breathing in a large room. The team observed a significant build-up of aerosols, over time, despite the use of common cloth and blue surgical masks. According to the researchers, the exhaled droplets were so tiny that these can remain suspended and travel through air.The study finally showed that most common masks filter only about 10 per cent of exhaled aerosols primarily due to issues with their fit and filter. The remaining aerosols, it was found, are redirected in an unfiltered state, mostly out of the top of the mask covering the nose, and escape into the surrounding air.By contrast, high-quality and more expensive masks such as N95 and KN95 filter more than 50% of exhaled aerosols that can accumulate indoors and, when inhaled, lead to the transmission of Covid-19, the study found.Speaking on the exercise, Serhiy Yarusevych, its lead investigator, said, “There is no question that it is beneficial to wear any face covering, both for protection in close proximity, and at a distance in a room. However, there’s a reason that medical practitioners wear an N95 mask…these work much better. We have provided solid numbers and rigorous analysis to back our assumption.”Yarusevych also recommended the use of N95 and KN95 masks in indoor settings, such as schools and work places, as much as possible.An earlier research established that aerosols, when dispersed by people infected with coronavirus, can transmit SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The transmission can take place even outside the two-meter social distancing gap widely suggested by health authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/better-face-masks-can-mitigate-spread-of-covid-19-indoors-study-101629645445917.html

Our forces are keeping a safe distance from the outer areas of the airport to prevent any possible clashes with the Taliban,” the official said.Various reports have suggested that the insurgents are present at the checkpoints leading up to the Kabul airport.Johnson’s statement to convene a G7 meeting – which includes the UK, US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan, comes after he said on Friday that the UK will work with Taliban “if necessary” to find solutions to the Afghanistan conflict.Also Read | ‘Committed to Afghanistan; will work with Taliban if necessary’: UK PM Johnson“What I want to assure people is that our political and diplomatic efforts to find a solution for Afghanistan, working with the Taliban, of course, if necessary, will go on and our commitment to Afghanistan is lasting,” he told the media following an emergency Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms (COBRA) meeting focussed on Afghanistan.The UK PM though accepted that the “logistical challenges” at the Kabul airport are “formidable,” he noted that British troops are doing an “outstanding job in very difficult circumstances.”The Johnson-led government on Tuesday announced the Afghanistan Resettlement and Assistance Programme (ARAP) under which Afghan citizens, who have worked for the UK in Afghanistan, will be permitted to reside in the European nation over a period of five years. As many as 5,000 Afghans will be rendered refuge in the first year itself.

The ISPR on Sunday said that the injured were shifted to a medical facility in Khuzdae.Balochistan, a restive province, has seen an uptick in violence over the past few weeks. Earlier this week, two children were killed along with four others which included a Chinese citizen when a suicide bomber blew himself up targeting a vehicle carrying Chinese nationals in Gwadar province.Separatist group Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) earlier in July set fire on installations made by Chinese telecom companies in Balochistan’s Quetta and detained six officials who were involved with these telecom projects. The insurgents also believe that the Pakistan government along with these Chinese telecom companies like Huawei, Netcom, Exeleron and ZTE is setting up a communications network in hilly regions of resource-rich Balochistan to spy and trace the region's citizens under the Universal Service Fund programme. The region is also among the focal points of China's $60 billion Belt and Road development programme.The region also saw increased fights between Baloch insurgents and Pakistan security forces.

22-08-2021||World||Provincial Chinese capital bans unvaccinated from entering public areas||Authorities of a provincial capital in northern China have said citizens not vaccinated against Covid-19 will not be allowed to enter public places including hospitals, malls, subways, hotels, and markets.Grassroot workers in the city have been ordered to daily submit the names and details of people who have not taken the jab to local committees and sub-district offices.The government of Hohhot, capital of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, said those who have not been vaccinated but found to be responsible for spreading Covid-19 will be prosecuted, Chinese media reported on Sunday.This is the first time authorities of a major city in China have made vaccinations compulsory except for medical reasons.Residents have to show proof of vaccination and a green health code to enter public areas.In July, the national health commission (NHC) had said “informed, consented and voluntary” were the basic principles for China’s inoculation programme, adding, however, that people without medical reasons and within the acceptable age should take the shots.The NHC issued the guidelines after authorities in several cities had issued rules saying unvaccinated people will be prohibited from entering public venues such as hospitals and supermarkets.The government of Tanghe county, in central China’s Henan province, for example, had requested civil servants, including retired staff, to get vaccinated or warned that they won’t be allowed to continue to work or receive salary.The Hohhot government’s decision, announced on Saturday, seems a departure from the NHA guidelines.“In principle, it is not advisable to enter the above-mentioned places (without being vaccinated),” the Hohhot government notice said after listing the places banned for those who have not taken the jabs.The banned public places include markets, tourist attractions (scenic spots), amusement parks, indoor enclosed entertainment venues, cinemas, cultural centres and libraries.“Those who have not been vaccinated shall be persuaded by their units to be vaccinated as soon as possible before the end of August,” the notice quoted by Chinese media said.Students have been advised not to go to school without being fully vaccinated, the notice indicated.Inner Mongolia’s push to boost vaccination rates comes as the ruling Communist Party of China stresses on achieving herd immunity - which puts an end to community transmission - by December this year.The decision also comes in the backdrop of the recent outbreak in several parts of China of the Covid-19 Delta variant; more than 1,300 cases were reported during the cluster outbreaks, the highest for China since last year.Not only the fear of censure, Chinese cities have also offered incentives to citizens including electronic bikes, eggs, ice cream and milk to get jabbed.Over 1.9 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in China as of Wednesday, NHC data showed.China could reach 80% Covid-19 vaccines coverage by the end of this year, achieving herd immunity, the country’s top epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan said in a virtual speech at a health conference on Friday.A total of 777.046 million people in China, a country of 1.4 billion, have been fully vaccinated, NHC spokesperson Mi Feng said earlier this month.China has also been vaccinating children and teenagers aged between 12 and 17 with over 60 million doses administered in the age group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/provincial-chinese-capital-bans-unvaccinated-from-entering-public-areas-101629638597878.html

The Islamist movement has, however, slammed the United States for the chaos. “America, with all its powers and facilities, has failed to restore order at the airport. While there is peace and calm all over the country, there is chaos only at the Kabul airport,” Amir Khan Mutaqi, a Taliban official, told AFP.Also Read | Taliban blame US for Kabul airport chaos as Afghans race to fleeEarlier in the day, the British defence ministry said in a statement at least seven Afghans have been killed near the international airport.Also Read | 7 Afghans killed in chaos at Kabul airport, says British militaryThe desperation among the Afghans to leave their homeland is evident from several visuals that have emerged from the airport in the wake of the Taliban’s return to power.

He added that the issue of refugees from Afghanistan will be a priority for the Russian foreign ministry.Some central Asian nations, including Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan — which share borders with Afghanistan — have raised concerns over the influx of refugees into their countries after fleeing Taliban regime. They are worried Islamic State fighters and other fundamentalists as well as religious extremists could infiltrate into the countries in the guise of refugees.Al Jazeera reported that thousands of natives of Uzbekistan and other central Asian countries joined the IS while hundreds others found refuge in northern Afghanistan.Countries like Uzbekistan and Tajikistan fear that Taliban's hardline religious views could disturb their secular social fabric.Thousands of Afghans have been making desperate attempts to flee the war-torn nation after Kabul fell to the Taliban last week.The Pentagon said last week that the US has evacuated more than 7,000 people from Afghanistan since the start of rescue operations on August 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-taliban-regime-afghan-refugees-russia-vladimir-putin-central-asia-101629632850937.html

If you've tested positive for Covid-19, I urge you to opt-in to help us better understand the effectiveness of the vaccines and develop future treatments," health secretary Sajid Javid tweeted.Antibody testing will be rolled out to thousands of adults a day across the UK from Tuesday. If you’ve tested positive for COVID-19, I urge you to opt-in to help us better understand the effectiveness of the vaccines and develop future treatments.https://t.co/qvGzhf8b0THere's all you need to know about this new initiative:(1.) Under the scheme, which comes into effect from Tuesday, any citizen who is aged over 18 can opt for this antibody testing while booking PCR test to see if they are infected with Covid-19.(2.) Those who return a positive test result will then receive "two-finger prick" antibody tests at home. These are to be completed and sent back for laboratory analysis.(3.) Each day, a maximum of 8000 people, who opted for the antibody test and subsequently tested positive for the coronavirus disease, will receive the test kit.(4.) The tests will be offered by the UK Health Security Agency, which will work with the National Health Service (NHS) Test and Trace testing services in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to monitor the level of antibodies among positive Covid-19 cases across the UK.(5.) There are two stages in this test. The first stage will determine the level of antibodies a person had before current positive Covid-19 test result. It is to be taken "as soon as possible" after testing positive for the viral disease.(6.) The second stage is for 28 days after testing posit. It will determine the antibodies generated in response to the infection.(7.) The two sets of data will then be compared to study the proportion of those who caught the virus despite developing antibodies through vaccination, or while they earlier had Covid-19.(8.) However, those who test positive for antibodies should continue following the norms as a positive antibody test does not mean they are immune from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-announces-antibody-tests-for-people-positive-with-covid-all-you-need-to-know-101629630156443.html

Now, a senior Taliban official has put the blame of the evacuation chaos on the United States.“America, with all its power and facilities … has failed to bring order to the airport. There is peace and calm all over the country, but there is chaos only at Kabul airport,” Taliban official Amir Khan Mutaqi told AFP.On Sunday, the British defence ministry said that at least seven Afghan citizens died in the mayhem at the airport, even as scores of civilians tried to escape Afghanistan.A journalist, who was among a group of media workers and academics fortunate enough to reach the Kabul airport for a flight, said that people were begging to be flown out of the country.“They were showing us their passports and shouting ‘take us with you … please take us with you’,” the journalist was quoted as saying by AFP.The media worker added that the Taliban fighter ahead of them shot in the air to make the crowd disperse.Britain’s Sky News reporter Stuart Ramsay, who was at the airport on Sunday, said that people were being “crushed”, while others were “dehydrated and terrified.”The pandemonium is a sign of worry especially because the US has set August 31 as the deadline to complete the evacuation, and there are up to 15,000 US nationals and between 50,000 and 60,000 Afghan allies still in Afghanistan, according to AFP.Also Read | US may enlist commercial airlines to help evacuate Afghan refugeesUS President Joe Biden, who has come under severe criticism for his decision to end America’s longest war and withdraw the troops from Afghanistan, termed the evacuation to be “one of the largest, most difficult airlifts in history.” “I cannot promise what the final outcome will be,” he added in a televised address from the White House on Friday.Also Read | Kabul evacuation among ‘most difficult’ in history’: BidenThe Pentagon on Saturday said that as many as 17,000 people, including 2,500 Americans have so far been evacuated from Afghanistan. According to Reuters, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said, “We’re fighting against both time and space … And we’re trying to do this as quickly and safely as possible.”The US, meanwhile, has advised its citizens still in Afghanistan to keep from travelling to the Kabul airport due to potential security threats outside the gates of the venue. Furthermore, Biden has also warned the Taliban with “swift and forceful response” if they attack the US forces or cause disruption of the country’s operations at the Hamid Karzai airport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/peace-everywhere-but-kabul-airport-taliban-blame-us-for-evacuation-mayhem-101629631804817.html

The state-run Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) was the sole commercial airline which carried out evacuation operations helping diplomats and foreign nationals from Afghanistan exit the country after the Taliban took control of the nation last week.The PIA said that it ‘temporarily suspended’ operations due to lack of facilities and ‘heaps of garbage’ on the tarmac of Hamid Karzai International Airport. People familiar with the developments also told Geo News that there were no security personnel or immigration officials at the Kabul airport. Workers with the sanitation department also were absent from their duties following the takeover by the Taliban. The people familiar with the developments said that the ‘authorities were afraid that garbage at the airport’s tarmac could lead to a tragic accident’.The PIA spokesperson Abdullah Hafeez told news agency Radio Pakistan that the PIA temporarily suspended its flight operations to Afghanistan due to lack of necessary facilities at Kabul airport. “We have talked to the Afghan Civil Aviation Authority for restoration of all required facilities at Kabul airport as soon as possible so that PIA could resume its flight operation,” Hafeez was quoted as saying by Radio Pakistan.He said that the PIA has evacuated 1,500 people, including journalists, UN officials and Pakistani nationals, in five flights.Chaotic scenes unfurled over the last two weeks in Kabul airport as several Afghan citizens struggled to get out of Afghanistan in a bid to escape the Taliban takeover. People in the war-torn country were reminded of the regressive regime of the Taliban between 1996-2001 following their hostile takeover of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-suspends-flight-operations-to-afghanistan-101629626618882.html

The Afghan community in Austria is one of the largest such communities in the world per capita, after those in Iran, Pakistan and Sweden. There are still major issues with their integration and thus we are against additional inclusion,” a rough translation of Kurz’s tweet, posted in German, read. On the return to power of the Taliban regime for the first time since 2001, the young Chancellor described as “unacceptable” the “complete undoing of progress made in Afghanistan in the last 20 years on human rights and women’s rights.”Es darf von uns nicht hingenommen werden, dass die in den letzten 20 Jahren in #Afghanistan erzielten Fortschritte bei Menschen- und Frauenrechten wieder gänzlich zunichte gemacht werden. Wenn wir als #EU mit den Taliban das Gespräch suchen, dann vor allem darüber!While he admitted that events taking place in Afghanistan are “dramatic,” Kurz warned against “repeating the mistakes of 2015.” He tweeted, “The people from Afghanistan should be helped by our neighbouring states. The European Union must secure the external borders and fight against illegal migration and human traffickers.”Die Ereignisse in Afghanistan sind dramatisch, aber wir dürfen die Fehler von 2015 nicht wiederholen.

22-08-2021||World||No super-spreader event: US wants world leaders to address UNGA event virtually||The United States has called on world leaders to virtually attend the upcoming annual session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) to prevent the weeklong high-level programme from becoming a super-spreader event amid rising concerns over the rapid spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease.The UN General Debate is slated to begin on September 21 and will run through September 27. On September 25, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to address the session physically. This is as per the first provisional list of speakers for the General Debate at the 76th session of the UN General Assembly. US President Joe Biden is also scheduled to speak at the event, his first address to the world organisation as the American leader.US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield has reportedly written to the 193 member states of the UN that as the host country of the UN headquarters, her country bears a “significant responsibility” to ensure the safety of participants and New York residents."So too does the Secretariat and President of the General Assembly. We need your help to prevent UNGA 76 High-Level Week from being a super-spreader event,” she further wrote.Stating that the Covid-19 pandemic continued to pose a significant health risk around the world, Thomas-Greenfield said the Delta variant has “necessitated enhanced mitigation” measures given its virulence among fully vaccinated and unvaccinated persons alike.With cases and hospitalisations increasing sharply in the US and all counties in New York City currently rated as having the highest level of community transmission, she said, “In light of current health concerns, we will convey to all member states and observers that heads of delegation should consider delivering their statements to the UN General Assembly’s General Debate by video.”In case delegations choose to travel to New York for the General Debate, the US requested that delegations bring the minimum number of travellers necessary.So far, 167 heads of state and heads of government and 29 ministers and diplomats are scheduled to address the UN General Debate. About 40 leaders are listed to address the high-level session through pre-recorded statements, including Iran, Egypt, Indonesia, South Africa and Nepal.The 76th session of the UN General Assembly will begin September 14. Maldives Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid will be president of the year-long session.The US is also urging member states to address all other high-level events, including those held on the sidelines, virtually.Thomas-Greenfield said while the UN Secretariat has already communicated some modalities for the high-level week, “I want to make clear our call, as the host country, for all UN-hosted meetings and side events, beyond the General Debate, to be fully virtual".Parallel meetings and high-level events drawing travellers to New York needlessly increase risk to the community, New Yorkers and other travellers, she said.“I am particularly concerned regarding the possibility of the UN, through the auspices of the Secretary-General and the President of the General Assembly, hosting several in-person high level events during high-level week -- possibly to include events on climate change, vaccines, the 20th Anniversary of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, the Food Systems Summit, and the high-level dialogue on Energy.“We feel strongly that the General Debate should be the only event held with in-person participation during High-Level Week; the United States is willing to make every effort to make these important events on shared priorities successful in a virtual format,” Thomas-Greenfield said.She said with a view to ensure safety of UNGA participants and New York residents, the US will significantly limit its in-person delegation travelling to New York and Washington encourages other member states to do the same."We must each do our part in reducing the number of activities that would draw travellers to New York City at this time,” Thomas-Greenfield said.Last year, world leaders had submitted pre-recorded video statements for the UNGA session in September, as heads of state and government could not physically attend the annual gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic. It was the first time in the UN's 75-year history that the high-level session had gone virtual.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-super-spreader-event-us-wants-world-leader-to-address-unga-event-virtually-101629622609869.html

The hardline Islamist group, which has now taken control of the state apparatus in Afghanistan, wasted no time in wake of the chaotic withdrawal of American troops from the country, quickly assimilating the US-made array of weaponry into its own ranks.The Taliban dressed up in American military gear we left behind when we fled the country and staged their own mock Iwo Jima photo. pic.twitter.com/Akr2fQTnvqAlso Read | ‘The Resistance has just begun’: Ahmad Massoud, son of assassinated anti-Taliban fighter, calls for supportIn a renewed propaganda push, the Taliban are attempting to solidify their control in Afghanistan by releasing a series of footage that show the insurgents inspecting long lines of vehicles and opening crates of new firearms, communications gear, and even military drones. The group has also released propaganda videos their fighters wearing stolen US-made military gear, including assault rifles and sophisticated tactical radio. The video, with a musical soundtrack, was aired on propaganda channels affiliated with the Taliban and said they have deployed soldiers from the “the Badri 313 Brigade” to guard locations in Kabul.This Badri 313 Battalion, a little-known elite unit within the ranks of the Taliban, has now reportedly 'recreated' one of the most important and recognisable images from World War II - Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima.As can be seen from the photos, the Badri 313 unit has its fighters donned in US-made tactical gear, complete with night-vision goggles, camouflage, and combat equipment, to simulate the iconic World War II photograph.

The Resistance has just begun.Massoud is the son of Ahmad Shah Massoud, who was known as the Lion of Panjshir and led the strongest resistance against the Taliban from his stronghold in the valley until he was assassinated two days before 9/11 by al Qaeda terrorists of Moroccan origins. The Panjshir Valley, which never fell to the Taliban during the civil war of the 1990s and was not conquered by the Soviets a decade earlier, is now Afghanistan's last remaining holdout against the Sunni Pashtun forces.Also read | Ahmad Massoud, son of assassinated anti-Taliban fighter, requests US for weapons“My father, Commander Massoud, our national hero, bequeathed to me a legacy: and that legacy is to fight for Afghans’ freedom. That fight is now irreversibly mine. My companions in arms and I are ready to give our blood. We call on all free Afghans, all those who reject servitude, to join our bastion of Panjshir, the last free region in our tormented land. To Afghans of all regions and tribes, I say: do fight with us!” Massoud said in a letter to Levy on August 16. He also called for aid from those in France, Europe, America and the Arab world, who he said helped them in their fight against the Soviets and then against the Taliban 20 years ago. “I ask: Will you, dear friends in freedom, assist us once more, as in the past? Despite the betrayal of some, we still have confidence in you. We Afghans find ourselves in the situation of Europe in 1940. Except in Panjshir, the debacle is near total, and the spirit of collaboration with the Taliban is spreading among the vanquished, who lost this war by their own failings. Only we remain standing. And we will never yield,” he said.Also read | Son of famed Afghan commander Massoud steps into spotlightSeveral photographs on social media have shown Massoud meeting Afghanistan's defiant vice president Amrullah Saleh in what appears to be an effort to take on the Taliban.

We Afghans have not even lost a battle, since Kabul did not fight. Here in Panjshir, Mujahideen young and old have taken up arms,” he added.In an almost poetic call for help, Massoud said, “Together we will write a new page in the story of Afghanistan. It will be a new chapter in the eternal resistance of the oppressed against tyranny.”Massoud reiterated his call for help in an op-ed published Wednesday in The Washington Post as well and called on the United States to help with arms and ammunition to his militia.

"We cannot wait, passively for the possible impact," the country's citizens' protection minister Michalis Chrisochoidis told reporters on Friday. "Our borders will remain safe and inviolable." The development comes amid apprehensions in Europe, which is still living under the shadow of a migrant crisis triggered by the 2015 Syrian war, of a renewed influx of migrants into the continent triggered by the Taliban's Afghanistan offensive.Greece has also installed a new surveillance system along its border with Turkey, the Reuters news agency reported, adding that the country is taking all measures to alert its border forces, making sure it does not become Europe's gateway again.Chrisochoidis, the Greek minister, said that the extension to the existing 12.5-kilometre fence on the border with Turkey had been completed in recent days, as well as a hi-tech, automated electronic monitoring system.Greece and Turkey, Nato allies and historic rivals, have long been at odds over migrant issues and competing territorial claims in the eastern Mediterranean.Nearly a million people had fled war and poverty in the Middle East following the Syrian war, finding their way to Greece from Turkey, before travelling northward to wealthier states. However, the migrant arrivals, either by land or by sea, slowed in recent years (since 2016) when the EU agreed on a deal with Turkey to stem the flows in exchange for financial support.The country fears a repeat of the situation, when it was at the frontline of the migrant influx, and is taking measures in advance this time to prepare for the "possibilities for migrant flows".Meanwhile, Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, faced with the new wave of migration from Afghanistan, has called on other European nations to share the responsibility of providing refuge to the stranded people from the war-torn country. Warning that Turkey won't become Europe's "refugee warehouse", Erdogan said earlier this week that his government would “if necessary” engage in talks with a government that could be formed by the Taliban ” for the stability and security of this country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fearing-renewed-refugee-influx-greece-erects-wall-along-turkey-border-101629616257939.html

However, there is no clarity yet on whether the key points have been discussed.It was learnt that the legal, religious and foreign policy experts in the Taliban were deliberating on the framework that would form the basis of their government.One of the founding members of the Taliban and the militia’s second-in-command, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar reached Kabul on Saturday to join the discussions with Afghan political leaders.This comes a day after former Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the High Council of National Reconciliation, met Kabul’s acting governor Abdul Rahman Mansour, in which they discussed the security of Kabul and its people.ALSO READ | Taliban may not announce new government until August 31 as per 'deal' with US: ReportPolitical analyst Tariq Farhadi was quoted as saying by Tolo News that the Taliban is likely to take around 10 days, as there are issues concerning the inclusion of women and representatives of all Afghan ethnicities in the government.“If they continue with their monopolisation of power like Ashraf Ghani and distribute it to certain provinces, without respecting other provinces and their people there could be a possibility of a civil war,” warned another political analyst, Farhad Akbari, according to Tolo News.Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi is scheduled to visit Kabul later in the day to meet with Taliban leaders. Weiss Nasir, a political analyst Tolo News spoke to, said Qureshi's visit assumes significance at a time when Pakistan is willing to "play its part" in forming a new government in Afghanistan with the Taliban and politicians.A senior Taliban leader said last week, however, stressed there would be no democratic system at all in Afghanistan because it "does not have any base" in the country, while highlighting that the new regime would impose the Shariah law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-afghanistan-government-framework-kabul-discussion-101629614953730.html

22-08-2021||World||Israel bombs Gaza after violent clashes along border||Israeli warplanes bombed Gaza on Saturday after clashes between its troops and Palestinian protesters left dozens injured, including an Israeli border policeman and a 13-year-old Palestinian boy who were both critically wounded.The Israeli military said it carried out airstrikes against four weapons sites and that it had reinforced its Gaza division with additional troops.The escalation came exactly three months since Israel and the enclave's Islamist rulers Hamas reached a truce following their deadliest fighting in years.Israeli troops fired at Palestinian protesters who gathered near the Gaza border wall, the army and Palestinian witnesses said.A Palestinian gunman fired at Israeli troops through an opening in the wall and crowds of young protesters hurled explosives over the barrier and tried to scale it.The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said the injured included a 13-year-old boy left in a critical condition after being hit in the head."Forty-one civilians were wounded with various injuries," the ministry said in a statement, with Hamas saying "thousands" of protesters had taken part.The Israel Border Police said a 21-year-old sniper in its undercover unit was critically wounded when he was shot by a Palestinian protester."His condition is critical and there is a risk to his life," it said of the wounded officer.Hamas called for protestIsraeli police commissioner Kobi Shabtai in a statement vowed the force would "continue to act firmly and with all our might against those who want to harm us."Defence Minister Benny Gantz had warned that "these are definitely extremely serious events that will have a response".Shortly after his comments, the Israeli Air Force said on Twitter that its "fighter jets struck four weapons manufacturing and storage sites belonging to the Hamas terrorist organisation".There were no immediate reports of any casualties from the strikes.Hamas had called a protest Saturday to mark the burning 52 years ago of Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam."Al-Aqsa Mosque is a red line, and any attack on it will be met with valiant resistance from our people," the movement said in a statement.Late Saturday, Hamas and other groups in Gaza issued a joint statement in which they "saluted the heroic youth" who clashed with Israeli forces.The violence is some of the worst since the May 21 ceasefire came into force.Over 11 days in May, Israel pounded Gaza with airstrikes in response to rockets fired from the enclave.Gaza reconstructionHamas said it took action after Israeli security forces stormed Al-Aqsa in May.Reconstruction in Gaza has stalled since the ceasefire, in part because of a crippling blockade Israel has maintained on the enclave since Hamas seized power in 2007.On Thursday, Israel announced it would allow funds from Qatar to reach impoverished Palestinians in Gaza. Other restrictions remain.The ceasefire Egypt brokered between Hamas and Israel has largely held, although there have been flare-ups.On Monday Israel said its "Iron Dome" missile defence system intercepted a rocket fired by militants in Gaza into Israel, the first time since the recent battle.That came after four Palestinians were killed in the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank.In 2018, Gazans began a protest movement demanding an end to Israel's blockade and a right for Palestinians to return to lands they fled after the Jewish state was founded.The Hamas-backed weekly demonstrations, often violent, sputtered as Israel killed some 350 Palestinians in Gaza over more than a year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-bombs-gaza-after-violent-clashes-along-border-101629614945225.html

The flights won’t ply from Afghanistan itself but might include carrying stranded people at American bases in Germany, Qatar and Bahrain. However, officials at the Pentagon didn’t specify which airports or bases the planes might be used at.Also Read: IAF's C-17 aircraft with 168 people from Kabul lands at Hindon airbaseThe CRAF is a nearly 70-year-old programme that provides backup to military aircraft capabilities during a crisis related to national defense. It was created after the Berlin airlift between 1948 and 1949, during which the US and the UK delivered more than 2.3 million tonnes of food, fuel and supplies to its ally West Berlin.The United States Transportation Command, however, told reporters on Saturday that the Pentagon has set no such plan in motion yet.President Biden told reporters on Friday that the US has made “significant progress” in evacuating US citizens, Afghan allies and others, even as the Taliban has started to crack down on dissent.However, the US and German embassies asked their citizens in Afghanistan to not travel to Kabul airport due to security concerns. The US embassy cautioned citizens that they should travel to the airport only if there is an “individual instruction from a US government representative to do so”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-may-enlist-commercial-airlines-to-help-evacuate-afghan-refugees-101629614449333.html
22-08-2021||World||US: At least 10 killed in Tennessee flash floods; dozens missing||Catastrophic flooding in Middle Tennessee left at least ten people dead and dozens missing Saturday as record-shattering rainfall washed away homes and rural roads, authorities said.Business owner Kansas Klein watched in horror from a bridge Saturday morning as cars and entire houses were swept down a road in Waverly, a town of about 4,500 people that Klein, 48, has called home for more than half his life.Two girls who were holding on to a puppy and clinging to a wooden board swept past, far too fast for Klein and other onlookers to go down and grab hold of them.After being told by authorities to go back, Klein returned a couple of hours later, shocked that the floodwaters had almost entirely receded and aghast at the destruction that was left behind.“It was amazing how quick it came and how quick it left,” Klein said.Klein said his restaurant, a decade-old New York-style pizzeria, was still standing, but the morning deluge of between 10 and 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain in Humphreys County had caused floodwaters to reach 7 feet (2.1 meters) inside the eatery, rendering it a total loss.After leaving his restaurant, Klein walked to the nearby public housing homes and heard yelling. A man had just recovered a baby's body from one of the homes. Other bodies would soon follow.“I'm looking at my restaurant, thinking how horrible it was that I lost my restaurant and then I walk around the corner and see someone's baby dead — my restaurant doesn't mean a whole lot right now,” Klein told the Associated Press in a phone interview Saturday night, still in shock as he watched a local news channel air footage he had recorded on his phone hours ago.The low-income homes — dozens of block buildings known as Brookside — appeared to have borne the brunt of the flash flood, Klein said.“It was devastating: buildings were knocked down, half of them were destroyed,” Klein said.“People were pulling out bodies of people who had drowned and didn't make it out.”Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis told news outlets more than 30 people have been reported missing. It was not immediately clear how many had lived at Brookside, located about 60 miles (96 kilometers) west of Nashville.Two of the bodies recovered were toddlers who had been swept away from their father, Davis told WSMV-TV.Waverly couple Cindy Dunn, 48, and her husband Jimmy, 49, were rescued from their attic by a crew who used a bulldozer to reach them.“Hell. That's what we had to go through,” Cindy Dunn told The Tennessean.She said her husband woke her up Saturday, telling her that floodwaters had pushed her car to their backyard. Eventually, the water in their house rose to at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) high, forcing them to the attic. Dunn said the rooftop wasn't an option.“My husband is dealing with cancer. He's going through chemotherapy. And I am an amputee. So there was no going anywhere besides the attic,” Dunn said.Dunn said their home and neighboring houses “are gone.”Just to the east of Waverly, the town of McEwen was pummeled with about 17 inches (43 centimeters) of rain in less than a day, prompting water rescues, road closures, and communications disruptions.That rainfall total smashed the state's 24-hour record of 13.6 inches (34.5 centimeters) from 1982, according to the National Weather Service Nashville, though Saturday's numbers would have to be confirmed.Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee tweeted on Saturday, “Tennesseans, please stay cautious of rising floodwaters caused by heavy rainfall in parts of Middle TN. We are actively working with emergency response officials & first responders as they support Tennesseans in flooded areas.”The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency activated its emergency operations center and said agencies that include the Tennessee National Guard, the state Highway Patrol, and Fire Mutual Aid were responding to the flooding. In a bulletin, TEMA called the situation “dangerous and evolving” and urged people to avoid travel in the affected counties.Klein isn't sure what the future holds for his family or his town.He also isn't sure what happened to the two girls and the puppy he witnessed who had been clinging to the board. He heard that a girl and a puppy had been rescued downstream and that the other girl was also saved, but he wasn't sure it was them.“This is the third 100-hundred year flood that we've had in about 10 years,” referencing 2010 and 2019 floods. “But this is 100 times worse than either one of them was. ... The last report I saw was there were 31 missing. This is a small town so the odds are I know most of those people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-at-least-10-killed-in-tennessee-flash-floods-dozens-missing-101629613017399.html

I was one of those girls”.Also read | Taliban attack women, children at Kabul airport despite peace promise: ReportShe further said her desire to invest in the education of Afghan girls who have no way to leave the war-torn country only grew louder and stronger even as the world focussed on desperate measures being adopted by panic-driven residents to escape the Taliban, known for their brutal imposition of a regressive version of the Sharia law during their previous rule when girls and women’s rights were among the worst hit.“My students, colleagues, and I are safe with enormous gratitude to our ever vibrant global village. The time to appropriately express my gratitude will come. But right now there are many who aren’t or increasingly don’t feel safe.

22-08-2021||World||Hurricane Henri closes in as Northeast US braces for impact||Hurricane Henri kept on course early Sunday to crash into a long stretch of northeastern coastline, as millions on New York’s Long Island and in southern New England braced for flooding, toppled trees and extended power outages.With the centre of the storm projected to pass just off the eastern tip of Long Island by midday, hurricane warnings extended from coastal Connecticut and Rhode Island to near the old whaling port of New Bedford, Massachusetts, and across the luxurious oceanfront estates of New York’s Hamptons to the summer getaway of Fire Island.The first thunderstorms bringing what could be up to half a foot (15 centimeters) of rain arrived late Saturday, and flash flooding began in some areas overnight. Bands of heavy rain overwhelmed storm drains and drivers plowed through foot-deep water in a few spots in New York City, and Newark and Hoboken, New Jersey.Tropical storm-intensity winds were expected to begin striking the coast at around 8 amPeople in the projected path spent Saturday scrambling to stock up on groceries and gasoline. Those close to the coast boarded up windows and, in some cases, evacuated.Residents and visitors on Fire Island, a narrow strip of sandy villages barely above sea level off Long Island’s southern coast, were urged to evacuate. The last boats out left before 11 pm Saturday and officials warned there might be no way to reach people left behind.The evacuation threw a wrench into Kristen Pavese’s planned Fire Island bachelorette party. The group of 10 had intended to celebrate Saturday night, but ended up leaving on the ferry just a day after arriving. They had planned to stay until Monday.“I’m upset about it, but it’s the weather. It’s nothing I can control,” said Pavese, a Long Island resident. “I’ve been going to Fire Island for a long time, so I’m sort of familiar with this happening,”Approaching severe weather Saturday night also cut short a superstar-laden concert in Central Park. The show headlined by Bruce Springsteen, Paul Simon and Jennifer Hudson was meant to celebrate New York City’s recovery from the coronavirus. But officials asked concertgoers to leave the park during Barry Manilow’s set amid the threat of lightning.Gov. Andrew Cuomo, set to leave office Monday after resigning over a sexual harassment scandal, emerged Saturday to plead with New York residents to make last-minute preparations, warning that heavy rain, wind and storm surge from Henri could be as devastating as Superstorm Sandy back in 2012.“We have short notice. We’re talking about tomorrow,” Cuomo said in one of his final forays before TV cameras, a setting that shot him to fame during the worst of the pandemic last year. “So if you have to move, if you have to stock up, if you have to get to higher ground, it has to be today. Please,”Gov. Ned Lamont warned Connecticut residents they should prepare to “shelter in place” from Sunday afternoon through at least Monday morning as the state braces for the first possible direct hit from a hurricane in decades. Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee issued a similar warning.Major airports in the region remained open as the storm approached, though hundreds of Sunday's flights were canceled. Service on some branches of New York City’s commuter rail system was suspended through Sunday, as was Amtrak service between New York and Boston.The White House said President Joe Biden discussed preparations with northeastern governors and that New York Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who succeeds Cuomo on Tuesday, also participated.Biden later began approving emergency declarations with Rhode Island.New York hasn’t had a direct hit from a powerful cyclone since Superstorm Sandy wreaked havoc in 2012. Some of the most important repairs from that storm have been completed, but many projects designed to protect against future storms remain unfinished.With a top wind of 75 mph (120 kph), just above hurricane strength, Henri sped up to move north at 21 mph (38 kph) as of Saturday night. It was still about 180 miles (290 kilometers) south-southeast of Montauk Point on the tip of Long Island.Some gas stations from Cape Cod to Long Island sold out of fuel. Southampton Town Supervisor Jay Schneiderman described a run on supplies like batteries and flashlights as people “are starting to wake up” as weather models showed the storm's centre would run “smack on the town of Southampton.”Regardless of its exact landfall, broad impacts were expected across a large swath of the Northeast, extending inland to Hartford, Connecticut, and Albany, New York, and eastward to Cape Cod, which is teeming with tens of thousands of summer tourists.Storm surge between 3 and 5 feet (1 to 1.5 meters) was possible in much of Long Island Sound all the way to Chatham, Massachusetts, and slightly less on Long Island's Atlantic coast, the hurricane center said. Flash flooding was possible in inland areas already saturated by recent rain.In the Hamptons, the celebrity playground on Long Island’s east end, officials warned of dangerous rip currents and flooding that’s likely to turn streets like the mansion-lined Dune Road into lagoons.“We have a lot of wealthy people. There’s no doubt that we do, but everybody pulls together in an emergency,” Schneiderman said. “So, you know, yeah, there are people hanging out on their yachts at the moment drinking martinis, but they’re also starting to talk about this storm and I’m sure they’re going to want to be helpful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-henri-closes-in-as-the-northeast-braces-for-impact-101629611477550.html
22-08-2021||World||Canada polls: Trudeau’s Liberal Party unlikely to get majority||With four weeks of the campaign for the 2021 Federal elections in Canada remaining, the Liberal Party leader (and caretaker Prime Minister) Justin Trudeau’s gamble for calling snap polls amid a fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic may partly pay off. Trudeau is favoured to head the next government, even if that will still be short of a majority in the House of Commons.Trudeau was strangely absent from the campaign trail on Saturday, but the latest polls indicate the ruling Liberal Party may garner additional seats but, as things appear, not gain enough to get a majority that was the rationale behind risking the elections scheduled on September 20.Poll trackers are not exactly in line with Trudeau’s ambition to capture a majority and not depend on support from another party to implement its agenda as his government had to do after the 2019 Federal elections, when the Liberal party fell 13 seats short of the 170 majority mark in the 338 seats House of Commons. Of course, when he first came to power in Ottawa in October 2015, Trudeau led his party to a thumping victory with 184 seats.That a minority verdict may be in the offing was underscored by the updated Poll Tracker from the news outlet CBC, which noted, “The Liberals continue to hold a lead over the Conservatives in national polling and would likely gain seats if an election were held today, but are slipping further away from being within reach of the 170 seats needed for a majority government.” The ruling party has 34.2% support, against 30.1% for the principal opposition party, the Conservatives. No tracker gives the Conservatives enough seats to capture a majority or even emerge as the single-largest party.Modelling from the election analysis outlet 338 Canada projects a similar scenario: As of Saturday, Trudeau’s party is slated to capture 156 seats, with the Conservatives getting 117. It also puts the odds of the Liberals getting a majority at just 26.4%.The latest Federal vote intention data from the non-profit Angus Reid Institute also places the Liberals comfortably ahead of their rivals, with 36% support against 30% for the Conservatives.As it stands, Trudeau is almost certain to return as Prime Minister, but his objective of securing a majority may well be thwarted by the voters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-polls-trudeau-s-liberal-party-unlikely-to-get-majority-101629610095860.html

According to the Tolo News agency, Qureshi is scheduled to be in Kabul on August 22, Sunday. This will be the first visit by any foreign leader to the insurgents in the war-torn country after their lightning-fast offensive this month won them control of the state apparatus. As per a political analyst cited by the agency, Qureshi's visit is largely on account of the fact that Pakistan wants to play its part in forming the new government in Afghanistan.Also Read | Under Taliban, Afghanistan is the address of global jihadThe Taliban are trying to hammer out a new government in Afghanistan after its forces swept across the country as US-led forces pulled out after two decades, with the Western-backed government and military collapsing. The Reuters news agency reported on Saturday that the group's co-founder, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, arrived in the Afghan capital of Kabul earlier in the day for talks with other leaders on forming the government.Qureshi, Pakistan's foreign minister, on Saturday held telephonic conversations with his counterparts in Russia, Germany, Turkey, the Netherlands, and Belgium. In conversation with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, Qureshi emphasised that a peaceful and stable Afghanistan was of critical importance for Pakistan and the region."Pakistan had consistently supported the Afghan peace process,” he said, according to the Pakistan foreign office, adding that an "inclusive political settlement" was the best way forward for peace and stability in Afghanistan.A Taliban official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters earlier this week that the new government structure in Afghanistan will not be a democracy by Western definitions, but “will protect everyone’s rights.”Also Read | Afghan crisis: Propaganda against Taliban false, says Pakistani ministerThe Taliban, who follow an ultra-hardline version of Sunni Islam, have sought to present a more moderate face since returning to power in Afghanistan, saying they want peace and will respect the rights of women within the framework of Islamic law. Afghan refugees, however, insist that the "moderate" face of the Taliban is only a temporary show.When in power from 1996-2001, also guided by Islamic law, the Taliban stopped women from working or going out without wearing an all-enveloping burqa or a male relative and did not let girls from going to school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-likely-to-host-first-foreign-leader-pak-minister-qureshi-at-kabul-today-101629604107969.html
22-08-2021||World||Under Taliban, Afghanistan is the address of global jihad||US President Joe Biden has played politics with terror when he claimed mission accomplished in his August 20 speech after taking credit for the decimation of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and 2011 neutralisation of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. The pusillanimous retreat of the US forces from Afghanistan, leaving both weapons and men behind, is nothing short of an abject surrender at the hands of shalwar-kameez-sandal wearing AK-47 rifle-toting Sunni Islamic militia. The unfortunate part is that the Taliban did not even deliver a knock-out punch, the US forces simply chose to run away from the battlefield. The loss of the US credibility globally on the advice of its second-division ally UK with the Pakistan army, of all the people, acting as a broker in the horrible deal with the Taliban, will play out in the coming decade with innocents having to pay the price of terror.While al Qaeda may not have the organisational structure of the previous decade in Afghanistan, the Salafi organisation with its ideological brother, Lashkar-e-Taiba in Pakistan, is very much alive in the Af-Pak region. So is the Islamic State of Khorasan Province. The Taliban along with Haqqani Network and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) share the same Deobandi ideological platform, which gets inspired from Wahhabism. And the aim of all these boys, as the delusional UK chief of defence staff Nick Carter defined the Taliban, is the establishment of the Islamic Caliphate and global jihad. Also read | Air India flight with 87 Indians from Kabul lands in Delhi, another enrouteWith the Taliban now occupying 652,000 square kilometres of Afghanistan Emirates territory barring Panjshir Valley, the global jihad now has an address in Kandahar with a showroom in Kabul. This moment is akin to the Islamic State capturing Mosul in Iraq in 2014 and the world especially the Yazidis and Shias still have nightmares of those brutal days.Also watch | The Taliban leader who once trained at Indian Military Academy: Sher StanikzaiWhile the US may have washed its hands off playing the global cop and given priority to gender politics, Afghanistan under the Taliban will be the beacon of jihad and will become the galvanising force for other gun-toting non-state actors to take on their governments particularly in Africa and Asia. A weak Taliban may force multiply the clout of its mentor Pakistan but a strong Taliban will press for Pashtun rights way beyond the Durand Line and destabilise Islamabad. A similar ripple effect will also be seen in the Middle East with increase Islamic radicalisation all over the world.Also read | Taliban hold keys to trillion-dollar trove of minerals, but it's not easy to tapEven though the US and the UK believe the Taliban narrative that they will not export terror to a third country for recognition and funds, Afghanistan will become the new terror factory with more than 40 terror groups in Pakistan sending their cadre for graduation with state of the art US weapons, communication devices, drones and helicopters. With Baloch insurgents and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan already targeting the Chinese engineers working on the CPEC project, there is no Xinjiang insurance policy for Beijing too. Shia Iran will be safe till such time it plays ball with the Taliban and allows passage to Sunni jihadists as it did in the past. As Islamic groups are known to undergo metamorphosis, it is quite evident that new terrorist groups, successors of Harkat-ul-Ansar and HUJI in the 1990s, will spawn from Afghanistan under the watch of the Taliban. India by its geographical location, regional adversaries, democratic polity, and culture will be the first ones to get hit. The world has suddenly lost appetite for Rambo and US Seal Hollywood movies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/under-taliban-afghanistan-is-the-address-of-global-jihad-101629601393384.html
22-08-2021||World||Taliban hold keys to trillion-dollar trove of minerals, but it's not easy to tap||The Taliban, now in control of the state apparatus in Afghanistan, have inherited an untapped $1 trillion trove of minerals, some of which could power the world's transition to renewable energies, but tapping the resources would not come so easy. Highlighting that the country has long struggled to tap into its vast deposits, the AFP news agency reported that the Taliban are already in a "financial bind", as major aid donors stopped their support for Afghanistan after the hardline Islamist group came to power two decades after their ouster.According to a report by the US Geological Survey (USGS), the mineral resources include bauxite, copper, iron ore, lithium, and rare earth.Copper prices have soared to more than $10,000 per tonne this year, as the metal, with its very high thermal and electrical conductivity, has become a commodity in demand for making power cables.Lithium, on the other hand, is a crucial element in making car batteries, solar panels, and wind farms. The International Energy Agency estimates the world demand for lithium will grow by over 40 times by 2040, as the need for renewable resources surfaces.Guillaume Pitron, the author of the book "The Rare Metals War", noted that Afghanistan "sits on a huge reserve of lithium that has not been tapped to this day."The country is also home to rare earth, a crucial part of the clean energy sector. These include Neodymium, praseodymium and dysprosium. Afghanistan also mines for talc, marble, coal, and iron. It has done better digging for precious stones such as emeralds and rubies as well as semi-precious tourmaline and lapis lazuli, but the business is plagued with illegal smuggling to Pakistan.According to the USGS, all these untapped mineral riches are estimated to be worth a total of around $1 trillion. Afghan officials, however, have put the worth three times as high.However, there is no certainty that Afghanistan will become a mineral El Dorado, AFP cited French expert Pitron as saying. "For that, you need a very stable political climate," he said. "No company will want to invest if there is no stable political and legal system." He added that it can take as long as 20 years between the discovery of a mineral deposit and the start of mining operations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-hold-keys-to-trillion-dollar-trove-of-minerals-but-it-s-not-easy-to-tap-101629599253772.html

The World Health Organization (WHO) on Saturday issued a statement raising an alarm over the healthcare situation in Afghanistan, where conflict had left countless people vulnerable to hunger and illnesses. According to the public health body's estimates, around half of Afghanistan's population, which includes more than four million women and nearly 10 million children, are in dire need of humanitarian assistance.Also Read | Haunted by Syrian war, Europe seeks to avoid influx of migrants from AfghanistanAccording to reports, the UN agency's spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic said in a statement that the current drought in Afghanistan is expected to worsen an already dire situation. "Continuity of health services must continue without interruption across the country, with a focus on ensuring women have access to female health workers," said the WHO spokesperson. "Most major health facilities are functional. And this is based on provincial-level field monitoring. Health workers have been called to return to or to remain at their posts, including female health staff."Notably, the United Kingdom has said that it will administer vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to Afghan refugees coming to the country on fleeing the Taliban.

However, the exact extent of the cyber breach and the suspected perpetrators behind the attack still remain unclear, according to the reports.The US cyber attack story was first played up by Jacqui Henrich, the White House correspondent for Fox News, who said that the breach is believed to have occurred "a couple weeks ago". Citing a person familiar with the development, the journalist reported that the US state department's ongoing mission to evacuate Americans and allied refugees in Afghanistan has, however, not been affected in any manner. According to the Fox News reporter's tweet thread, the exact extent of the breach, the investigation into the suspected entity behind it, the efforts being taken to mitigate it and any ongoing risk to operations still remain unclear.It is unclear when the breach was discovered, but it is believed to have happened a couple weeks ago.A source familiar tells Fox the State Department’s ongoing mission to evacuate Americans and allied refugees in Afghanistan “have not been affected”.Moreover, the Fox News reporter said that a department of state spokesperson told her that the officials are currently "not in a position to discuss the nature or scope of any alleged cybersecurity incidents at this time" for 'security reasons'. "The department takes seriously its responsibility to safeguard its information and continuously takes steps to ensure information is protected," the government spokesperson added, according to the reporter. The same statement was also relayed on part of the government to the CNBC media network when the latter tried to contact the Department of State for a quote on the alleged cyber attack incident.However, the Reuters news agency reported that a "knowledgable source", without confirming any incident, said that the US state department has not experienced significant disruptions and has not had its operations impeded in any way.Notably, members from the US Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee released a bipartisan report earlier this month which stated that none of the eight federal agencies that were reviewed for security had met even the basic cybersecurity standards and protocols to secure the personal identification information of Americans as well as equipment and programs on the agency’s networks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-state-department-hit-by-cyber-attack-perpetrators-unknown-report-101629593137701.html
