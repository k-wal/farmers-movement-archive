Biden also thanked Qatar for its long-played role to pave the way for intra-Afghan peace talks.“The two leaders underscored the importance of continued close coordination on developments in Afghanistan and the broader Middle East, and they welcomed the upcoming summit of regional states to be held in Baghdad towards the end of the month,” the statement further read.This came on the same day that Union external affairs minister S Jaishankar held talks with his Qatari counterpart Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani on the ongoing conflict in war-torn Afghanistan. The minister held talks with Al-Thani during his halt in Doha en route to India from the US.“Met Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani … during my stopover in Doha.

About four to five white flags of what the Taliban call the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan were found atop Jamia Hafsa madrassa, reported Dawn. The local administration and police said the flags were spotted atop the madrassa after prayers but were removed immediately.“The flags were spotted after Zuhr prayers and shortly the capital administration and police were informed about it,” Dawn quoted the police as saying.Pakistan has been long accused of covertly supporting the Taliban militarily, financially, and with intelligence, which Islamabad has repeatedly denied. After the Taliban intensified offensive against the Afghan defence forces, reports emerged that fighters from Pakistan crossed over the border to support the group. Following the reports of flags atop the madrassa in Islamabad, the office of district administration, headed by Muhammed Hamza Shafqaat, said they were removed immediately. "Was removed there and then," tweeted the office.According to Dawn, senior officials and police said hoisting any flag in Pakistan was not a crime, adding that some flags, however, may spread terror among citizens. The administration later reportedly said that some students were behind the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-flags-hoisted-atop-madrassa-in-islamabad-police-say-not-a-crime-report-101629566171396.html

The risk, it added, also existed when the England football team played overseas. “This risk arose not just from individuals attending the event itself, but included activities undertaken during travel and associated social activities,” the study, a pre-print version of which was published on Friday, noted.Data analysed through contact tracing also found that the Euro 2020 final between England and Italy was a “superspreader” event due to the level of Covid-19 infection found in or around London’s Wembley Stadium on the day. PHE said 2,295 people were likely to have been infectious, with a further 3,404 people potentially acquiring infection at the July 11 match.Also, US weekly infections exceeded 1 million on Friday, apparently for the first time since last winter, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/9000-infections-in-uk-linked-to-euro-2020-event-data-101629567165868.html

Only a few private telecommunication companies have been operating in the past few days.“I went to the office this morning, but the Taliban who were at the gate told us they have not received any orders to reopen government offices,” said Hamdullah, a government employee. “They told us to watch TV or listen to the radio for an announcement about when to resume work.”Most roads in the capital were largely deserted save for Taliban checkpoints and patrolling militants. Roads leading to the foreign ministry in central Kabul were also closed, an employee of the ministry told AFP.“They aren’t allowing anyone to enter the ministry building,” he said on condition of anonymity. “One of them even told me to wait until the new minister and directors are appointed.”‘Ashraf Ghani’s brother has pledged allegiance’The Taliban on Saturday said that Hashmat Ghani, a close aide of ex-president Ashraf Ghani, has pledged allegiance with the group, Sputnik reported.“Hashmat Ghani, brother of former Afghan president Ashraf Ghani, swore allegiance to the Islamic Emirate in the presence of Khalil al-Rahman Haqqani,” a statement from the group allegedly said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-block-govt-staff-from-returning-to-work-101629567063737.html

21-08-2021||World||'It's all lies': Taliban's PR offensive falters as videos of beatings emerge||In the last few days, TV crews from Afghanistan's Al-Emarah Studio, which produces pro-Taliban multimedia content, have been out on the streets of Kabul speaking to residents with reassuring messages about life returning to normal."How confident are you?" asked an interviewer with a Al-Emarah microphone in the city centre. "100%," came the reply. "Security is good, there are no thieves, we are very happy."The message is in sharp contrast to the chaos in parts of Kabul since the Islamist militants swept in last Sunday after a lightning conquest of Afghanistan.Thousands of people have swarmed around the airport, desperate to escape amid fears of reprisals by the insurgents and harsh Islamic law now that they are back in power.It has presented one of the toughest tests yet for the movement's communications strategy, which has grown into a sophisticated operation in recent years and yet is struggling to calm widespread panic.The Al-Emarah interviews were a tiny step towards trying to win back control of the message.For the moment, Al-Emarah websites in five different languages have been difficult to access or apparently offline from Friday, for reasons which remain unclear. The clips could be seen on social media accounts, however.On Saturday, several Taliban spokesmen took to television studios to reassure residents that the streets were safe. On the same day, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the top Taliban political leader in Afghanistan, arrived in Kabul to set up a police force.Also Read | ‘Not a single euro’: EU talks tough on Taliban’s promise of peace, women rights'IT'S ALL LIES'Getting their message across has proved harder since the Taliban conquered Afghanistan than it was when they were fighting an insurgency against foreign and U.S.-backed local armed forces.Over the years, it has often been a step ahead of the government, getting its message out with a mix of multi-lingual social media accounts, videos, photos and responsive, well-prepared spokesmen equipped with ready answers to reporters' questions.While Facebook and YouTube have banned the group, it has an active presence on Twitter and dozens of social media accounts either directly linked to the movement or which stick close to its message have sprung up.Many Afghans have treated those messages with disdain. The group has been blamed for thousands of civilian deaths in gun attacks and suicide bombings over the last 20 years, deaths it said were justified in its war against invaders.And with growing turmoil in Kabul and some other cities, the movement can no longer fall back on accusations of abuse and wrongdoing by the Kabul government and its international allies.The Taliban have tried to reassure both Afghans and the international community that they will respect people's rights and their forces will not exact revenge on members of the government and security forces.The news conference held by the Taliban's main spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid on Tuesday put a public face on the movement's communications operation for the first time.But social media feeds of beatings or shaky video of people being dragged from cars and houses have challenged the Taliban's narrative, sowing fear among a population still in shock from the sudden collapse of the government.Many of the accounts of abuse cannot be verified, but Taliban officials acknowledge the widespread fears.A senior official told Reuters he had heard of some abuses against civilians, but promised that any problems caused by people in the movement would be investigated.In a tweet on Saturday, Mujahid said the Taliban were setting up a three-member commission to handle problems encountered by the media.With smartphones as common in Kabul as anywhere else in the world and a youthful population that has grown up with the internet, the Taliban's communications strategy will likely keep evolving.But unless they can restore order to the streets and get people back to work, messaging alone is unlikely to be enough."I don't believe what they say at all, it's all lies. Nobody trusts what they say," said one Kabul resident, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/its-all-lies-taliban-s-pr-offensive-falters-as-videos-of-beatings-emerge-101629556589895.html

According to the scheme, as many as 5,000 Afghan citizens will be given refuge in the first year itself, UK home secretary Priti Patel was quoted as saying by BBC News. The scheme allows Afghans, who have worked for the UK in Afghanistan, to enter Great Britain.Meanwhile, The Guardian reported that women, children and religious minorities will be prioritised for the ARAP that allows Afghan citizens to resettle in the UK over a period of five years.The Johnson-led government has also announced 5 million pounds for local councils in England, Wales and Scotland offering to house Afghans who left their war-torn country and have arrived in the UK under the ARAP.During the COBRA meeting, Johnson also defended his foreign secretary Dominic Raab, who has come under fire over missing a phone call from his Afghan counterpart Hanif Atmar in the now ousted Ashraf Ghani-led government in Afghanistan. “I can tell you that the whole of the government has been working virtually round the clock, hitting the phones, to do what we can to sort it out; to deal with a situation that has been long in gestation and to make sure that we get as many people back as possible.”According to reports, Raab’s office was asked to call Atmar to request him for aiding in the evacuation of local interpreters who had helped UK officials and the military during the course of 20 years.Also Read | UK foreign minister failed to make a phone call to Afghan counterpart. Now demands of resignationHowever, Raab – on a holiday in Crete in Greece - reportedly never called Atmar, thereby igniting severe criticism from the opposition parties who have also demanded his resignation. “While the foreign secretary lay on a sun lounger, the Taliban advanced,” Labour party's foreign affairs spokesperson Lisa Nandy said.The UK PM stuck to his earlier statement where he said that the Taliban will be judged on the basis of their actions and not words, while “hoping” that they mean what they say. “As I said in the House of Commons, and I think that this is the position of … the President of the United States, President Macron of France, [German Chancellor] Angela Merkel, everybody that I talked to – everybody agreed that we will judge them on their actions, and that is the important thing.”Great Britain has since last Saturday evacuated as many as 1,615 people, including 399 British citizens and their dependents, 320 embassy staff, and a total of 402 Afghans who worked for the UK government in Afghanistan.Since its sweeping triumph over the Afghan troops – an outcome that was emboldened after US President Joe Biden’s announcement of withdrawing American army two decades later, Taliban have portrayed a relatively moderate outlook, assuring women and girls will be allowed to receive education and even work.At the extremist group’s first press conference, spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said that the Taliban are “committed to providing women with their rights based on Islam. "Women can work in the health sector and other sectors where they are needed. There will be no discrimination against women," TOLOnews quoted him as saying.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/committed-to-afghanistan-will-work-with-taliban-if-necessary-uk-pm-johnson-101629559197993.html

Addressing a joint press conference alongside Spanish President Pedro Sanchez and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, von der Leyen put strict conditions for releasing the one billion euros set aside for development said for the next seven years.“So let me be very clear on development aid. The 1 billion euros in EU funds set aside for development aid for the next seven years is tied to strict conditions: respect for human rights, good treatment of minorities, and respect for the rights of women and girls, just to name a few,” said the EU Commission president.She said the situation in Afghanistan is still very unclear and unpredictable, raising apprehensions about the Taliban’s promise of peace and inclusivity. Referring to the reports of women being turned away from their workplace and people being hunted down for their past work, the top EU official said not a “single euro of development aid can go to a regime that denies women and girls their full freedoms and rights to education and careers.”“We may well hear the Taliban's words, but we will measure them above all by their deeds and their actions,” she added.The Taliban’s months-long offensive to topple the Afghan government led by Ashraf Ghani resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people. After the Taliban completed a lightning takeover of Afghanistan on Sunday, the Kabul airport witnessed a chaotic situation as hundreds of desperate Afghans were trying to board military planes flown in by other countries to evacuate their staff and citizens.“This resettlement of vulnerable people is of utmost importance. It is our moral duty,” Von der Leyen said.She also stressed the need to prevent people from falling into the hands of smugglers and human traffickers. “This means, first, that we must offer legal and safe routes globally, organised by us, the international community, to those who need protection,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-a-single-euro-eu-talks-tough-on-taliban-s-promise-of-peace-women-s-rights-101629558851217.html

That storm killed at least 17 people.It has been almost a decade since such severe weather was expected in part of the region."The last time we had hurricane watches issued for the area was for Hurricane Irene, back in late August of 2011," tweeted the National Weather Service in New York City.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-henri-upgraded-to-hurricane-to-make-landfall-on-us-east-coast-on-sunday-101629558543999.html
21-08-2021||World||Science can’t keep up with coronavirus, creating worry for vaccinated||Anecdotes tell us what the data can’t: Vaccinated people appear to be getting the coronavirus at a surprisingly high rate. But exactly how often isn’t clear, nor is it certain how likely they are to spread the virus to others. And now, there’s growing concern that vaccinated people may be more vulnerable to serious illness than previously thought.There’s a dearth of scientific studies with concrete answers, leaving public policy makers and corporate executives to formulate plans based on fragmented information. While some are renewing mask mandates or delaying office reopenings, others cite the lack of clarity to justify staying the course. It can all feel like a mess.“We have to be humble about what we do know and what we don’t know,” said Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the head of the nonprofit Resolve to Save Lives. “There are a few things we can say definitively. One is that this is a hard question to address.”Absent clear public health messaging, vaccinated people are left confused about how to protect themselves. Just how vulnerable they are is a key variable not just for public health officials trying to figure out, say, when booster shots might be needed, but also to inform decisions about whether to roll back reopenings amid a new wave of the virus. On a smaller scale, the unknowns have left music lovers unsure if it’s OK to see a concert and prompted a fresh round of hang-wringing among parents pondering what school is going to look like. In lieu of answers, what has emerged is a host of case studies providing somewhat different pictures of breakthrough infections. Variables including when the surveys were conducted, whether the delta variant was present, how much of the population was vaccinated and even what the weather was like at the time make it hard to compare results and suss out patterns. It’s difficult to know which data might ultimately carry more heft.“It’s quite clear that we have more breakthroughs now,” said Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco. “We all know someone who has had one. But we don’t have great clinical data.”One of the best known outbreaks among vaccinated people occurred in the small beach town of Provincetown, Massachusetts, as thousands of vaccinated and unvaccinated alike gathered on dance floors and at house parties over the Fourth of July weekend to celebrate the holiday -- and what seemed like a turning point in the pandemic. About three-fourths of the 469 infections were among vaccinated people. Authors of a CDC case study said this might mean that they were just as likely to transmit Covid-19 as the unvaccinated. Even so, they cautioned, as more people are vaccinated, it’s natural that they would also account for a larger share of Covid-19 infections and this one study was not sufficient to draw any conclusions. The incident prompted the CDC to reverse a recommendation it had issued just a few weeks earlier and once again urge the vaccinated to mask up in certain settings.Still, the particular details of that cluster of cases may have made that outbreak especially bad, according to Gandhi.“The rate of mild symptomatic outbreaks in this population was higher because of a lot of indoor activity (including intimacy), rain that weekend, not much outside time and mixture of people with different vaccination status,” she said in an email.A newly released, far larger CDC case study of infections in New York state, meanwhile, found that the number of breakthrough infections has steadily ticked up since May, accounting for almost 4% of cases by mid-July. Those researchers cautioned that factors such as easing public health restrictions and the rise of the highly contagious delta variant might impact the results. Yet another CDC case study, in Colorado, found that the breakthrough infection rate in one county, Mesa, was significantly higher than the rest of the state, at 7% versus about 5%. The report suggested it was perhaps because the delta variant was circulating more widely there, but also noted the ages of patients in Mesa and the lower vaccination rate may have played a role.Research out of Israel has strongly suggested that immunity to the virus wanes in the months after inoculation, and more recently, that breakthrough cases may eventually lead to an uptick in hospitalizations. Case studies and data from some states in the U.S. have similarly shown an increase in breakthrough cases over time. But with the delta variant also on the rise, it’s difficult to tell whether waning immunity to any type of coronavirus infection is to blame, or if the vaccinations are particularly ineffective against the delta variant. It could be both, of course. Changing behavior among vaccinated people could be a factor, too, as they return to social gatherings and travel and dining indoors.All that said, some facts are well established at this point. Vaccinated people infected with the virus are much less likely to need to go to the hospital, much less likely to need intubation and much less likely to die from the illness. There’s no doubt that vaccines provide significant protection. But a large proportion of the nation -- almost 30% of U.S. adults -- have not been vaccinated, a fact that has conspired with the highly contagious delta variant to push the country into a new wave of outbreaks. “The big picture here is that the vaccines are working and the reason for the spike in the U.S. is we have too little vaccine uptake,” Frieden said. To a certain extent, breakthrough cases of any virus are expected. In clinical trials, no Covid vaccine was 100% effective -- even the best vaccines never are. The more the virus is in circulation, the greater the risk of breakthrough cases. It’s also common for some aspects of viral immunity to naturally wane over time. For the time being, there are simply more questions than answers. Are breakthrough infections ticking up because of the delta variant, waning immunity or a return to normal life? Are vaccinated people more vulnerable to severe illness than previously thought? Just how common are breakthrough infections? It’s anyone’s guess.“It is generally the case that we have to make public health decisions based on imperfect data,” Frieden said. “But there is just a lot we don’t know.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/science-can-t-keep-up-with-coronavirus-creating-worry-for-vaccinated-101629555375239.html

21-08-2021||World||What is the role of Haqqani network, Afghanistan's most feared militants, in new Taliban regime?||Some of the Taliban's top leaders are gathering in Kabul to discuss the formation of a new Afghan government -- including a representative from the Haqqani network, the country's most feared militants.The Haqqanis have been blamed for some of the deadliest attacks in recent years, claiming the lives of civilians, government officials and foreign forces.Despite their reputation, they are expected to be powerful players in the new regime following the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan last week.Who are the Haqqanis?The shadowy group was formed by Jalaluddin Haqqani, who gained prominence in the 1980s as a hero of the anti-Soviet jihad. At the time, he was a valuable CIA asset as the United States and its allies such as Pakistan funnelled arms and money to the mujahideen.During that conflict and following the Soviet withdrawal, Jalaluddin Haqqani fostered close ties with foreign jihadists -- including Osama bin Laden.He later allied with the Taliban who took over Afghanistan in 1996, serving as a minister for the Islamist regime until it was toppled by US-led forces in 2001.Jalaluddin Haqqani's death after a long illness was announced by the Taliban in 2018, and his son Sirajuddin formally became the network's chief.Thanks to their financial and military strength -- and a reputation for ruthlessness -- the Haqqani network is considered semi-autonomous while remaining within the Taliban fold.Mainly based in eastern Afghanistan -- with alleged bases across the border in Pakistan's northwest -- the group became more visible in the Taliban leadership in recent years, and Sirajuddin Haqqani was appointed deputy leader in 2015.His younger brother Anas, once imprisoned and sentenced to death by the previous Afghan government, has held talks with former president Hamid Karzai and ex-chief executive Abdullah Abdullah since the fall of Kabul last weekend.Also Read | Economy, security: As Baradar arrives in Kabul, Taliban finalise governance planWhy are they so widely feared?The Haqqani network is blamed for some of the deadliest and most shocking attacks in Afghanistan during the last two decades.They have been designated a foreign terrorist group by the United States, and are also under United Nations sanctions.The Haqqanis have a reputation for frequently using suicide bombers -- including drivers in cars and trucks packed with huge amounts of explosives -- and have demonstrated the ability to carry out complex, high-casualty assaults on major targets including military installations and embassies.In October 2013, Afghan forces intercepted a Haqqani truck in eastern Afghanistan that contained nearly 28 tonnes (61,500 pounds) of explosives, according to the US National Counterterrorism Center.The Haqqanis have been accused of assassinations -- including an attempt against then-president Karzai in 2008 -- and kidnappings of officials and Western citizens, for ransom and forcing prisoner exchanges.They have also long been suspected of links with the Pakistani military establishment -- US Admiral Mike Mullen described them as a "veritable arm" of Islamabad's intelligence in 2011.Pakistan denies the allegation.The Haqqanis have also hugely contributed to the Taliban's fighting ranks, and are the group's "most combat-ready forces", UN monitors said in a June report.The monitors also described the network as the "primary liaison" between the Taliban and Al-Qaeda.What is their role in the new Taliban regime?The Haqqanis have emerged as serious players in the Taliban's political project with at least two of their leaders in Kabul as talks begin on forming the next government.Sirajuddin Haqqani's formal elevation to the deputy leader position six years ago cemented that role, analysts say.And the release of his brother Anas from Afghan custody in 2019 was seen as a move to help kickstart the direct US-Taliban talks that eventually led to the troop withdrawal.Sirajuddin Haqqani even wrote an op-ed in The New York Times last year, outlining the Taliban's position on the US talks and the conflict in Afghanistan -- though in diplomatic tones that belied the network's violent reputation.While Anas Haqqani has held talks with Karzai, his uncle Khalil Haqqani was seen leading prayers in Kabul on Friday.Sirajuddin and Khalil are both still listed as wanted by the United States, with millions of dollars in bounties on offer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-the-role-of-haqqani-network-afghanistan-s-most-feared-militants-in-new-taliban-regime-101629547326727.html

Capital Kabul's capture on Sunday signified the end of the US's longest war, launched after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks.On Tuesday, Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban's longtime spokesman in his first-ever public appearance to address those concerns at a news conference, promised the Taliban would honour women's rights within the norms of Islamic law, in an effort to portray a more moderate stance.During a three-hour meeting of university professors and owners of private educational institutions, Taliban representative and Head of Higher Education, Afghanistan, Mullah Farid said there is no alternative and co-education must end.He also said virtuous female lecturers would be allowed to teach only female students but not the male ones.Also Read | Islamic 'scholars' to decide on women’s 'right' to education: Taliban leaderFarid called co-education the 'root of all evils in society', the report said.In the last two decades, Afghanistan has implemented a mixed system of co-education and gender-based separate classes in all universities and institutes.Educationalists said government universities would not be affected by the decision but private institutes would struggle with already a low number of female students.Also Read | No revealing slipper, women not allowed to go out alone: Taliban diktatHerat, according to official estimates, has 40,000 students and 2,000 lecturers in private and government universities and colleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-ban-co-education-in-afghanistan-s-herat-province-report-101629545724702.html

Elon Musk also added his takeaway questioning whether they have not heard about the Delta variant which is driving the resurgence of the Covid pandemic across the world."Really?

21-08-2021||World||Haunted by Syrian war, Europe seeks to avoid influx of migrants from Afghanistan||From above, the new border wall separating Turkey from Iran looks like a white snake winding through the barren hills. So far it only covers a third of the 540-kilometer (335-mile) border, leaving plenty of gaps for migrants to slip across in the dead of night.Traffic on this key migration route from central Asia to Europe has remained relatively stable compared to previous years. But European countries, as well as Turkey, fear the sudden return of Taliban rule in Afghanistan could change that.Haunted by a 2015 migration crisis fueled by the Syrian war, European leaders desperately want to avoid another large-scale influx of migrants and refugees from Afghanistan. Except for those who helped Western forces in the country's two-decade war, the message to Afghans considering fleeing to Europe is: If you must leave, go to neighboring countries, but don’t come here.“It must be our goal to keep the majority of the people in the region,” Austrian Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said this week, echoing what many European leaders say.European Union officials told a meeting of interior ministers this week that the most important lesson from 2015 was not to leave Afghans to their own devices, and that without urgent humanitarian help they will start moving, according to a confidential German diplomatic memo obtained by The Associated PressAustria, among the EU’s migration hard-liners, suggested setting up “deportation centers” in countries neighboring Afghanistan so that EU countries can deport Afghans who have been denied asylum even if they cannot be sent back to their homeland.The desperate scenes of people clinging to aircraft taking off from Kabul’s airport have only deepened Europe’s anxiety over a potential refugee crisis. The U.S. and its NATO allies are scrambling to evacuate thousands of Afghans who fear they’ll be punished by the Taliban for having worked with Western forces. But other Afghans are unlikely to get the same welcome.Even Germany, which since 2015 has admitted more Syrians than any other Western nation, is sending a different signal today.Several German politicians, including Armin Laschet, the center-right Union bloc’s candidate to succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor, warned last week that there must be “no repeat” of the migration crisis of 2015.On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron stressed that, “Europe alone cannot shoulder the consequences” of the situation in Afghanistan and “must anticipate and protect ourselves against significant irregular migratory flows.”Britain, which left the EU in 2020, said it would welcome 5,000 Afghan refugees this year and resettle a total of 20,000 in coming years.Besides that, there have been few concrete offers from European countries, which besides evacuating their own citizens and Afghan collaborators, say they’re focusing on helping Afghans inside their country and in neighboring countries such as Iran and Pakistan.Europe “should not wait until people stand at our external border,” EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johanson said.Greece, whose scenic islands facing the Turkish coast were the European point of entry for hundreds of thousands of Syrians, Iraqis, Afghans and others six years ago, has made clear it doesn’t want to relive that crisis.Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said Wednesday that Greece won’t accept being the “gateway for irregular flows into the EU,” and that it considers Turkey to be a safe place for Afghans.Such talk makes Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan see red. His country already hosts 3.6 million Syrians and hundreds of thousands of Afghans, and he has used the threat of sending them to Europe for political leverage.“Turkey has no duty, responsibility or obligation to be Europe’s refugee warehouse,” Erdogan warned in a speech Thursday.The Turkish president talked about migration from Afghanistan in a rare phone call with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on Friday, and also is discussing the issue with Iran, a statement from Erdogan's office said.Attitudes toward migrants have hardened in Europe following the 2015 crisis, fueling the rise of far-right parties like the Alternative for Germany, the biggest opposition party in parliament ahead of the federal election next month.Even in Turkey, migrants from Syria and Afghanistan, once treated like Muslim brethren, are increasingly viewed with suspicion as the country grapples with economic problems including rising inflation and unemployment.Acknowledging the public’s “unease” about migration, Erdogan noted how his government has reinforced the eastern border with Iran with military, gendarmerie, police and the new wall, which has been under construction since 2017.AP journalists near the Turkish border with Iran encountered dozens of Afghans this week, mostly young men, but also some women and children. Smuggled across the border at night in small groups, they said they left their country to escape the Taliban, violence and poverty.“The situation in Afghanistan was intense,” said one young man, Hassan Khan. “The Taliban captured the whole of Afghanistan. But there is no work in Afghanistan, we were compelled to come here.”Observers say there are no indications yet of any mass movement across the border. Turkish authorities say they have intercepted 35,000 Afghans entering the country illegally so far this year, compared with over 50,000 in all of 2020 and more than 200,000 in 2019.Metin Corbatir, head of the Ankara-based Research Center on Asylum and Migration, said there has been a small increase in arrivals across the border from Iran recently, “but there is no mass migration.”Farha Bhoyroo, who works for the U.N. refugee agency in Iran, gave a similar assessment of the Afghan-Iranian border.“So far numbers are quite stable,” she said. “We have seen a slight increase in Afghan refugees coming to Iran, but we don’t qualify it as an influx.”UNCHR estimates that 90% of the 2.6 million Afghan refugees outside of the country live in neighboring Iran and Pakistan. Both countries also host large numbers of Afghans who left in search of better economic opportunities.By comparison, about 630,000 Afghans have applied for asylum in EU countries in the past 10 years, with the highest numbers in Germany, Hungary, Greece and Sweden, according to the EU statistics agency. Last year, 44,000 Afghans applied for asylum in the 27-country bloc.Jan Egeland, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said it’s not a forgone conclusion that the Taliban takeover will result in a new refugee crisis.“I would warn against a self-fulfilling prophecy,” he told AP. Afghans are “scared, bewildered but also hopeful that a long, long war will be over and maybe now they can avoid the crossfire.”He said much depends on the Taliban allowing development and humanitarian work in the country and on donor nations continuing to fund those efforts.“If you would have a collapse of public services and if there would be a major food crisis, there will be for sure a mass movement of people,” Egeland said.___Ritter reported from Rome.

Najla Ayoubi told Sky News that she has been speaking to women in Afghanistan and has received examples of "bad behaviour and violence against women”. Ayoubi said one woman was "put on fire because she was accused of bad cooking for Taliban fighters" in northern Afghanistan."They are forcing people to give them food and cook them food. Also, there are so many young women are being in the past few weeks being shipped into neighbouring countries in coffins to be used as sex slaves,” Ayoubi, who lives in the US after ‘fleeing for my life’ from the Taliban, said. "They also force families to marry their young daughters to Taliban fighters. I don't see where is the promise that they think women should be going to work when we are seeing all of these atrocities."Also read | 'Resistance is alive': Ex-Afghan leader says rebel forces took back 3 districtsAyoubi, now the chief of the coalition and global programmes at Every Woman Treaty which campaigns to end violence against women, said she had to escape from the Taliban for speaking for women's rights and described life under the Taliban as a "nightmare”. She was in a "powerful position" the day before it took power but was reduced to "nothing in the society". The lawyer said she had to be accompanied by her neighbour's four-year-old boy to the grocery shop because she is a woman.The Taliban’s claims that they will respect women’s rights and allow them to hold jobs and to go to schools and colleges have been met with deep scepticism. Several women journalists have said they have not been allowed to work by the Taliban. "I wanted to return to work, but unfortunately they did not allow me to work.

The news came on a day when President Joe Biden said he is not aware of American citizens facing difficulties getting through Taliban checkpoints.Pentagon leaders had earlier said that the scenes unfolding in Afghanistan, as citizens frantically tried to get out of the country and escape the new Taliban rule, were tough for them to watch.Austin told the House members that Americans have been "harassed and beaten" by the Taliban while trying to escape from Afghanistan, Politico reported quoting people aware of the developments of the briefing call. He further said that this is "unacceptable", Politico further reported.There are currently about 5,800 US troops at the airport in Kabul to help with evacuation efforts, an American official said on Friday. Austin has ordered about 6,000 troops to Kabul, a number that is expected to be reached in the coming days, according to the official.The US is trying hard to speed up the process of evacuation. With the August 31 deadline looming, tens of thousands still remained to be airlifted from the war-torn country. The United States is also evacuating Afghans who helped its troops during their two-decade-long stay in the country.“We have a moral obligation to help those who helped us. And I feel the urgency deeply,” Austin said on Friday.About 2,000 passengers were flown out on each of the past two days, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said.He added that the military has aircraft available to evacuate 5,000 to 9,000 people per day, but until Thursday far fewer designated evacuees had been able to reach, and then enter, the airport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-defence-secretary-lloyd-austin-says-americans-beaten-by-taliban-report-101629529738291.html

She did not take questions.The Kabul airport has been the site of chaos with thousands of desperate Afghans trying to flee as they clutched papers, children and belongings, as people from other countries also sought to leave after US and other foreign troops withdrew.At least 12 people have been killed since the Islamist insurgents took the capital on Sunday, NATO and Taliban officials said.Retno called for a "an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned inclusive political process" that will bring peace and stability in the country, and for women's rights to be upheld.Four Indonesian diplomats in the Pakistan-based mission will assess the situation in Afghanistan daily to determine next steps, she said.An operation for Indonesia, the world's biggest Muslim-majority country, to fly home including embassy staff and children, took longer than anticipated due to the situation at the Kabul airport, she said.Indonesia also picked up five Filipinos at the request of their government and two Afghan nationals, Retno said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-moves-afghan-diplomatic-mission-to-pakistan-101629527150406.html

However, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said that the presence of al Qaeda is not significant enough to merit a threat to the US as it used to be 20 years ago.Biden, while interacting with reporters on Friday, said there is a need to put things in perspective (about US troops' withdrawal from Afghanistan). "What interest do we have in Afghanistan at this point, with al Qaeda gone?" the President said."We went to Afghanistan for the express purpose of getting rid of al Qaeda as well as getting Osama bin Laden. And we did," he added.Hours later, the Pentagon acknowledged the presence of the terror group in Afghanistan amid its large-scale evacuation from the war-torn country."We know that al Qaeda is a presence as well as ISIS in Afghanistan and we've talked about that for quite some time," John Kirby said during a press briefing.Kirby said they do not believe the number of al Qaeda terrorists in the country "is exorbitantly high but we don't have an exact figure for you." He said their "intelligence gathering ability in Afghanistan isn't what it used to be".The issue about the presence of al Qaeda has gained prominence since the Taliban ousted a civilian government and took control of the power by force.

A senior Taliban official told AFP that Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar -- who co-founded the group -- would meet "jihadi leaders and politicians for an inclusive government set-up".Taliban officials said they included a top official of the Haqqani network, which has been designated a terrorist organisation by the United States with million-dollar bounties on its leadership.Also Read | Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar returns to Afghanistan after 20 years. Who is he?Six days after the hardline Islamist movement swept to power, the flow of people trying to flee continued to overwhelm the international community.Roads leading to Kabul airport were choked with traffic, while families hoping for a miracle escape crowded between the barbed-wire surrounds of an unofficial no man's land separating the Taliban from US troops and remnants of an Afghan special forces brigade helping them.Video of a US soldier lifting a baby over a wall at Kabul's airport offered the latest imagery of utter despair, following horror footage of people hanging onto the outside of departing planes."Please, please, please help me... where should I go, what should I do," one man, who said he worked for the US embassy in the mid-2000s, wrote on a WhatsApp group set up for people to share information on how to get out."I have tried to get there (to the airport) for some days, but I cannot reach. Please save me."Thousands of US soldiers are at the airport trying to shepherd foreigners and Afghans onto flights, but President Joe Biden admitted the troop presence offered no guarantees of safe passage."This is one of the largest, most difficult airlifts in history," Biden said in a televised address."I cannot promise what the final outcome will be, or... that it will be without risk of loss."Evacuation deadlineUS military helicopters were deployed to rescue more than 150 Americans unable to reach the airport on Friday morning, an official in Washington said.It was the first report of US forces going beyond the airport to help people seeking evacuation.A German civilian was also shot and wounded on his way to the airport, a government spokeswoman in Berlin said on Friday.Biden had set a deadline of August 31 to completely withdraw all troops from Afghanistan, but he flagged this could be extended to continue the airlifts.About 13,000 people have left on American military aircraft, the White House said. Thousands of others have fled on other foreign military flights.US diminishedThe crisis has cast another shadow over the United States' status as a global superpower and its ability to help allies around the world.The Taliban swept into the capital last week, ending two decades of war, after Biden pulled nearly all US troops out of Afghanistan.Biden and other US allies were stunned at how quickly the Taliban were able to rout government forces, who surrendered en masse.The Taliban have promised "positively different" rule from their 1996-2001 stint in power, which was infamous for an ultra-fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law.Women were excluded from public life, girls banned from school and people stoned to death for adultery.They have vowed not to seek revenge against their opponents, promising a general amnesty for anyone who worked with the US-backed government.But an intelligence document for the United Nations said militants were going door-to-door hunting down former government officials and those who worked with US and NATO forces.According to the confidential document by the UN's threat assessment consultants seen by AFP, militants were also screening people on the way to Kabul airport.The German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle reported that the Taliban had shot dead the relative of one of its journalists while searching for the editor.Collective prideAt the first Friday prayers since the Taliban's return to power, imams and guest speakers celebrated the defeat of the United States.At one mosque in Kabul, gunmen flanked a scholar as he delivered a fiery speech in which he recounted how Afghans had beaten the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and now the United States on the battlefield."Afghans have once again shown collective pride," he said.At another mosque, the imam referenced the tragic scenes at the airport, describing those trying to flee as not having strong enough religious convictions."Those with weak faith are running after or hanging from American planes," he said."They should stay and build their country."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-co-founder-mullah-abdul-ghani-baradar-in-kabul-amid-talks-to-set-up-govt-101629526736365.html
21-08-2021||World||India expresses disappointment over continued ban on Canada flights||India has written to the Canadian government expressing its “disappointment” over the continuing ban of direct commercial flights.The ban was originally imposed on April 22 and was scheduled to expire on August 21, but on August 9, Transport Canada announced it had been further extended till September 21. The April decision had been predicated on concerns over the rising Covid-19 cases in India, particularly the spread of the Delta variant.In note verbales, or diplomatic communications, sent to Global Affairs Canada, the country’s foreign ministry, India’s high commission in Ottawa stated that the extension had “caused concern and anxiety” among nationals of the two countries seeking to travel between them.The Canadian government’s ban prevents all direct passenger flights from India.The Indian government is seeking resumption of those flights and scrapping of the mandatory RT-PCR tests required for travellers from India who transit through third countries.The ongoing restrictions, it has argued, “adversely affected” nearly 200,000 Indian students looking at starting post-secondary education in Canada and caused “great inconvenience” to the nearly 1.6 million strong Indo-Canadian community.It said that early return to normalcy in global mobility was in the interest of both countries.It also pointed out that India has administered over 570 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines, its declining positivity rate and expansion of its testing regime as well the proof of vaccination available digitally via the Cowin app.It also underscored that the daily caseload in India at this time is less than half that in September last year, during the first wave in India, when direct flights continued uninterrupted between the two countries.Given that context, it requested Canadian authorities to take steps to remove the restrictions currently in force.Under a reciprocal air bubble arrangement between the countries, Air India started operating flights from May 2020 and Air Canada since August that year and together accounted for daily flights between India and Canada till the ban came into place in April this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-expresses-disappointment-over-continued-ban-on-canada-flights-101629523087588.html

It is forecast to reach land later on Friday or in the early hours of Saturday.Veracruz and its waters are home to several oil installations, including Petroleos Mexicanos' Lazaro Cardenas refinery in Minatitlan in the south of the state. Latest forecasts showed Grace expected to hit Veracruz well to the north of Minatitlan.Through Sunday, the NHC said Grace would dump 6 to 12 inches (15-30 cm) of rain over large swaths of eastern and central Mexico, and up to 18 inches in some areas. The heavy rainfall would likely cause areas of flash and urban flooding, it added."We ask the population to be very alert," Laura Velazquez, head of Mexico's civil protection authority, told a regular news conference with President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.Grace pounded Mexico's Caribbean coast on Thursday, downing trees and causing power outages for nearly 700,000 people, but without causing loss of life, authorities said. Earlier in the week, it doused Jamaica and Haiti with torrential rain.In Tecolutla, a resort on the Gulf of Mexico, some tourists from Mexico City had still been enjoying the calm before the storm in the afternoon, even as light rain started to fall."We had to come, even if we get a bit wet," said Guillermina Morales, who was on a trip planned over four months ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/grace-becomes-major-hurricane-barrels-toward-mexico-s-gulf-coast-101629520427305.html

The day spreads awareness about issues that the elderly have to face in their everyday lives and they are thanked for their service and contribution towards the betterment of society.The World Senior Citizen’s Day was officially founded by former United States president Ronald Reagan in 1988. Reagan signed the promulgation of 5847 on August 19, 1988, which then appeared as the National Day of the Third Age on August 21. World Senior Citizen’s Day was first observed in 1991.Senior citizens are an important part of any society. However, many of them find it extremely difficult to survive in today’s modern world amid a rapid advancement of technology along with the changing social and economical environment. The coronavirus pandemic, which struck the world last year, requires even more specific care for the elderly so that they do not contract Covid-19.Some of the most common problems which senior citizens face include- forgetfulness, lack of understanding of technological devices such as smartphones and computers, health complications, loneliness and lack of financial support etc. In some cases, they also have to go through physical and mental abuse by their children and other family members.Senior citizens, some of who live alone, have a constant fear of what they will do if they suffer from a chronic disease in the present or future.In India, any person above the age of 60 is a senior citizen. Over the years, the central and state governments have announced a slew of schemes for their welfare. Some of these include the Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Scheme, National Programme for the Health Care of Elderly (NPHCE), Rashtriya Vayoshri Yojana among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-senior-citizen-s-day-today-a-look-at-problems-which-the-elderly-face-101629516389435.html

Both Mullah Baradar, said to be the front-runner as the Taliban candidate for President of Afghanistan, and Mullah Yaqoob, the son of Mullah Omar and deputy leader of Taliban, are in Kandahar.While ambassador Wang met his Pakistani counterpart on Wednesday to closely cooperate on the Afghan issue, he is understood to have met Mullah Baradar in Kandahar to offer Beijing’s help in the reconstruction of the Islamist Taliban-ruled country. China is not only pleased with the humiliation of the US at the hands of the Taliban but is also looking to sell the Belt Road Initiative (BRI) and exploit Afghan reserves of lithium and copper in the name of reconstruction. The larger Chinese game-plan is to reach the Central Asian Republics via Afghanistan for evacuation of gas and mineral resources.Also read | 3 Jaish terrorists killed in encounter at J&K's TralTaliban’s ideological comrade in jihad, Jaish’s Mufti Rauf met Mullah Yaqoob, who also doubles up as an ideologue in the absence of Mullah Haibatullah Akundzada, in Kandahar to offer allegiance on behalf of the Bahawalpur based group. Mufti Rauf's elder brother and Jaish Emir Maulana Masood Azhar was a Deobandi ideologue at a Harkat-ul-Ansar terror training camp in Khost before he was arrested on the outskirts of Srinagar in 1994. Azhar formed the Jaish group after his release in the Indian Airlines IC-814 hijacking to Kandahar in exchange for hostages. The entire hijacking was planned with the help of the then ruling Taliban leadership in December 1999.Also watch | Joe Biden warns Taliban amid criticism over Afghanistan crisis, evacuations﻿While the current Taliban leadership has gone on record saying that it will not allow Afghan soil to be used against any third country, the Sunni Pashtun UN-designated terrorist group has very close operational links with Al Qaeda and Jaish-e-Mohammed. Both these global terrorist groups are looking for sanctuaries within Taliban-ruled Afghanistan to train its cadre and wage jihad against their adversaries.

While China will maintain pressure on India on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and cement its ties with India’s adversaries in the neighbourhood, the rise of the Taliban will have an impact on India’s internal security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-envoy-and-jaish-commander-separately-call-on-taliban-leadership-101629514266097.html

Henkel also declined to specify the province where the two worked together.Now 46, Henkel lives in Colorado and works as a project manager for a cybersecurity firm."I relied on my interpreter to help me navigate the culture, navigate the protocols and navigate the language barrier," he said.Among the most valued contributions from "Kevin," Henkel said, was his ability to spot local leaders who had ties with the Taliban. "He could tell that there was a reign of fear that was being implemented," in a particular town, Henkel said.He also recalled an instance when "we actually got hit in a valley and we had to call in close air support to save us because we had hundreds of Taliban in these positions up in these hills. Kevin was the one who told us ahead of time, 'Hey, this was going to happen.'"From Henkel's experience with the Taliban, he believes the group will target those first who worked with foreigners."They have a list of all the interpreters that have ever worked for NATO," he said. "The only penalty that is acceptable to them is death. And that extends to his (Kevin's) family."The Taliban, for its part, said in a June statement former interpreters were not at risk, but should "show remorse."Pentagon spokesman John Kirby has said the United States will seek to evacuate as many Afghan interpreters as possible.When Henkel heard about US plans to pull out after a 20-year commitment in Afghanistan, he was "enraged."Having led combat operations himself, "there's usually an exfil - exfil plan means an exfiltration plan... I am not seeing happening right now," a situation Henkel described as "unacceptable" for some 18,000 Afghan translators and their families.According to Henkel, "Kevin" and his family have been turned away at local airfields by US forces while trying to escape, despite pressure to secure his departure from U.S. Representatives Joe Neguse and veteran, Jason Crow, both Democrats from Colorado.Crow's office confirmed his advocacy via telephone. Neguse was not immediately available for comment. "It is pure chaos," Henkel said "Kevin" told him via text Friday morning.The veteran and his interpreter are communicating as they always have via webchat. "We even talked about, wouldn't it be great someday if our kids could play together in a playground together. And we could grow old next to each other," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-only-have-hours-us-army-captain-s-desperate-appeal-to-save-his-afghan-interpreter-101629511334393.html

"What interest do we have in Afghanistan at this point with al Qaeda gone? We went to Afghanistan for the express purpose of getting rid of al Qaeda in Afghanistan as well as getting Osama bin Laden, and we did.”"You've known my position for a long, long time," Biden continued. "It's time to end this war. The estimates of the cost of this war over the last 20 years range from a minimum of $1 trillion to a think tank at one of the universities saying $2 trillion.

21-08-2021||World||Taliban websites disappear from internet amid tech crackdown||Taliban websites that delivered the victorious insurgents' official messages to Afghans and the world at large in five languages went offline abruptly Friday, indicating an effort to try to squelch them.It is not immediately clear, though, why the sites in the Pashto, Urdu, Arabic, English, and Dari languages went offline Friday. They had been shielded by Cloudflare, a San Francisco-based content delivery network and denial-of-service protection provider.Cloudflare has not responded to emails and phone calls seeking comment on the development, which was first reported by The Washington Post. The Cloudflare shield prevents the public from knowing who exactly hosts the sites.Also Friday, the popular encrypted messaging service WhatsApp removed a number of Taliban groups, according to Rita Katz, director of SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks online extremism.The websites' disappearance may just be temporary as the Taliban secures new hosting arrangements. But the reported removal of the WhatsApp groups followed the banning of Taliban accounts by Facebook, the service's parent company, on Tuesday after the US-backed Afghan government fell to the Taliban.WhatsApp spokesperson Danielle Meister did not confirm the removal but referred The Associated Press to a statement the company issued earlier this week saying it was “obligated to adhere to US sanctions laws. This includes banning accounts that appear to represent themselves as official accounts of the Taliban.”Katz said via email that she hoped the removal of the Taliban websites is just a first step to diminishing its online presence.Unlike the Taliban of 20 years ago that the US drove from power in Afghanistan, today's Taliban is immensely media savvy and its online infrastructure “inspires and mobilizes" al-Qaida and other extremist Islamist factions, said Katz.“Tech companies should do what they can to get ahead of this problem as soon as possible, as the group's online presence is stoking a newly emboldened jihadi movement worldwide,” she added.Twitter has not removed Taliban accounts and the group's spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, has more than 300,000 followers there. The company indicated Tuesday that as long as such accounts observe its rules — including not inciting or glorifying violence — they will remain up.Like Facebook, Google's YouTube considers the Taliban a terrorist organization and prohibits it from operating accounts.The Taliban is not on the US list of foreign terrorist organizations, but the US has imposed sanctions on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-websites-disappear-from-internet-amid-tech-crackdown-101629507864537.html

The desperation has been captured in images and videos from the airport, where people clung onto a taxing American military plane as it took off, leaving several – including an Afghan national sportsperson – to plunge to their deaths.On Thursday, officials in the UK told Sky News that people were passing their children, including infants, over barb wire airport fences in an attempt to get them to safety outside of the country.A US defense official said about 5,700 people, including about 250 Americans, were flown out of Kabul aboard 16 C-17 transport planes. In all, more than 18,000 people have been flown out of Kabul since the Taliban took over Afghanistan’s capital, a NATO official told Reuters.A Taliban spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment, Reuters reported. Since seizing Kabul, the Taliban have sought to present a more moderate face to the world, saying they wanted peace and would not take revenge against old enemies.The four-page report reproduced a letter it said had been written to one alleged collaborator who was taken from his Kabul apartment this week and detained for questioning over his role as a counter-terrorism official in the previous government.Reuters could not independently verify its authenticity.The letter, dated Monday, from the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan’s Military Commission, noted that the detainee had travelled to the UK as part of his role “which indicates you have had excellent relations with the American and British”.“If you do not report to the commission, your family members will be arrested instead. You and your family members will be treated based on Sharia law,” the letter said.The detainee’s name was redacted.Separately, a senior member of the security forces of the ousted administration sent a message to journalists saying that the Taliban had obtained secret national security documents and Taliban were arresting former intelligence and security staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-step-up-reprisals-after-promising-amnesty-101629493392372.html
21-08-2021||World||Kabul evacuation among ‘most difficult’ in history’: Biden||President Joe Biden said on Friday he could not guarantee the final outcome of the emergency evacuation from Kabul’s airport, calling it one of the most “difficult” airlift operations ever.“This is one of the largest, most difficult airlifts in history,” Biden said in a televised address from the White House. “I cannot promise what the final outcome will be.”The president said US forces have airlifted 13,000 people out of Afghanistan since August 14, and 18,000 since July, with thousands more evacuated on private charter flights “facilitated by the US government”. Evacuees include family members of US citizens, special immigration visa (SIV) applicants and their families, and vulnerable Afghans. Earlier on Friday, Biden and vice-president Kamala Harris met with the national security team to discuss the evolving situation in Afghanistan ahead of the remarks.Biden’s personal approval rating dropped 7 percentage points in an Ipsos/Reuters poll announced on Monday, to 46% from 53%, the previous week. This is his lowest rating in the Ipsos/Reuters weekly poll so far, and came amidst the collapse of the Afghanistan government, return of the Taliban and the evacuation crisis that played out in full public view.An Ipsos/Reuters poll conducted on August 16 found that 44 % adults thought the Biden administration had done a good job on Afghanistan, while 42% thought it had done a bad job. His three predecessors fared far better: George W Bush 47% good and 39% bad; Barack Obama 51% good and 38% bad; and Donald Trump 51% and 36% bad.Biden has defiantly defended his pullout decision and said, attracting severe criticism, that the chaotic scenes unfolding at the Kabul airport were an inevitable outcome. He has also promised to stay in Afghanistan as long as it takes to get all Americans out of there, even beyond the pullout deadline of August 31.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabul-evacuation-among-most-difficult-in-history-biden-101629483906793.html

Paul ‘Pen’ Farthing said that he will not leave the war-torn country without his Afghan staff and their immediate family members.Farthing, who served in the Royal Marine for 22 years, set up the ‘Nowzad’ animal shelter in 2007 after his first rescue dog. Since then, he has formed a staff of 25 Afghan nationals that also include three of Afghanistan’s first female veterinarians.Farthing has demanded that his staff and their families be evacuated along with him and be accepted as refugees in the UK. In an interview to news agency Reuters, he said, “My staff don’t deserve the fate that awaits them if they stay here in Afghanistan.”The Taliban had prohibited women from working under their previous regime two decades ago, and had also disapproved of having dogs as pets.Farthing said that the sanctuary could face reprisals as it was funded by foreign aid. “I had an opportunity, the fact that I am a British citizen, I'm going to use that to full effect - so I've said I'm not going until my staff leave this country,” he was quoted as saying by Reuters.Soon after regaining control over Afghanistan, Taliban spokesperson, Zabihullah Mujahid, in a first press conference said that women will be allowed to study and work but according to the Islamic Law. ““Taliban are committed to providing women with their rights based on Islam. Women can work in the health sector and other sectors where they are needed. There will be no discrimination against women,” he stated, adding that women would be “happy within the framework of Sharia.”The extremist group has also said that non-governmental organisations (NGOs) will also be allowed to function in Afghanistan.Also Read | Embassies, aid organisations will be safe in Kabul: Taliban's MujahidFarthing pointed out that despite Taliban patrolling the streets of Kabul, and their behaviour not being “overly friendly,” there has been a feeling of calmness around his community. He highlighted that the most dangerous zone was near to the airport where scores of Afghan nationals are desperately trying to escape the country.“You've got the British and Americans inside and then outside you've got this throng of people; and then you have the Taliban checkpoints," Farthing said.Although the extremist group have projected a reformed outlook this time, assuring protection and rights to women and children, including allowing them to go to schools to and working, the scepticism around these promises is prominent on the global platform.Canada has already said that they will not accept the Taliban regime as the government of Afghanistan as they replaced an elected and democratic dispensation “by force.” Japan on Friday also noted that it is not considering recognising the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.Also Read | Canada polls: All parties say Taliban-led Afghan govt won’t be recognisedMeanwhile, reports have already surfaced of the extremist group torturing Afghan citizens, especially women and children.Los Angeles Times reporter Marcus Yam posted some of the pictures on Twitter on Wednesday and claimed that the insurgents opened fire to drive people away from the airport, leaving at least half a dozen people wounded, including a woman and her child. Other images and videos also claimed that the fighters were beating women and children while they were trying to flee the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exbritish-marine-who-runs-animal-shelter-refuses-to-leave-without-afghan-staff-101629480325199.html
