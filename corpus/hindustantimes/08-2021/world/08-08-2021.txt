They accuse the federal government of exploiting the natural resources of the province.Chief Minister of Balochistan Jam Kamal Khan has condemned the incident."Terrorist elements want to ruin the province's peace. [We] will never allow terrorists to succeed in their nefarious plans," he was quoted as saying in a statement.A Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) spokesperson said that the police van was targeted via an improvised explosive device (IED) attached to a motorcycle.Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) chief Shehbaz Sharif said that the government must put in place measures to ensure the safety of lives and property of the people.Pakistan People’s Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, who is on a visit to Quetta, also condemned the blast and said that the government "must stop appeasing terrorists and implement the National Action Plan."The attack comes more than three months after a powerful bomb exploded in the parking lot of the Serena Hotel, killing five people and wounding a dozen others.The Chinese ambassador was staying in the hotel but was out at the time of the attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-blast-near-serena-hotel-in-quetta-leaves-2-cops-dead-12-injured-101628443506039.html

Modi will chair the debate virtually in view of the continuing Covid pandemic.The maritime security debate is the first of three signature events India is holding as UNSC chair for August. The other two are debates on UN Peacekeeping, to which India has been a generous and steadfast contributor, and counter-terrorism, which is a subject India has championed at the world body for decades as a leading victim, specially from state-sponsored groups and individuals across its western border. Indian external affairs minister S Jaishankar will chair the other two, and in-person at the UN headquarters in New York City.President Putin’s participation was noted as a significant gesture as he rarely attends such debates; the last one, people familiar with the matter, said was possibly 15 years ago.DRC’s President Tshisekedi is participating in the debate as a briefer on behalf of the African Union, 54 of whose members are part of the 55-member Africa group, which is the largest group of geographically categorised groups that UN members are divided into. Prime Minister of St Vincent and Grenadines Ralph Gonsalves was confirmed to participate as well but has pulled out for health reasons and will be represented by his son, who is a member of the cabinet.India’s presidency of the UNSC, meanwhile, faced its first pushback and from expected quarters. Pakistan has reacted strongly to the UNSC’s rejection of its formal request to attend the Friday briefing by the UN Assistance Mission on Afghanistan (UNMA) on the evolving security situation in the country as US-led international forces end their 20-year presence.“It is a matter of deep regret that, as the closest neighbour of Afghanistan, whose contribution in the ongoing peace process has been recognised by the international community, Pakistan’s request to the president of the Security Council to address the council’s session and present its perspective on the Afghan peace process and the way forward was not acceded to,” Pakistan’s ministry of foreign affairs said on Saturday.Pakistan had indeed made a formal request, but people familiar with the matter said, it was turned down because, one, neighbours do not automatically qualify to attend or address under rules, as are affected countries - as Afghanistan which attended. And, two, “where do you stop if all neighbours make the same request, to attend”.Some of Afghanistan’s other neighbouring countries had indeed expressed the desire to attend and address the meeting, but they were politely turned down as well, citing the same reason.Pakistan took aim in the comment at the president of the council, which for August is India. But, the people cited earlier insisted, the decision to keep out neighbours was taken collectively by the UN Security Council as a body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-president-to-attend-modi-s-unsc-debate-101628440871129.html

Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar III, the Sultan of Sokoto and the president general of the Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA), has asked Muslims to look out for the new moon of Muharram on Sunday. Abubakar issued the directive on Saturday, according to a Guardian report."Muslims are, therefore, requested to start looking out for the new moon on Sunday and report its sighting to the nearest District or Village Head for onward communication to the Sultan," he said.Authorities in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and other regions in the Middle East will decide the date for Muharram.Khaleej Times reported citing the Astronomy Centre that the moon is unlikely to be sighted on Sunday and therefore, the first of Muharram will fall on Tuesday across most Islamic countries. The Islamic new year will also begin on August 10 in the UAE, Khaleej Times said citing Dubai's Islamic affairs and charitable activities department calendar.Last week, the UAE's ministry of human resources and Emiratisation announced that the Hijri New Year holiday for the year 1443 would be marked by the public and private sectors on Thursday, August 12, this year.Muharram is the first month in the Islamic calendar and is one of the four sacred months mentioned in the Quran, along with the seventh month of Rajab, and the eleventh and twelfth months of Dhul-Qadah and Dhul-Hijjah, respectively. The Islamic New Year is based on the lunar system unlike the Gregorian New Year, which is based on the solar system. Islamic Hijri months also have either 29 or 30 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/muharram-2021-announcement-on-islamic-new-year-likely-today-101628432713161.html

The US Air Force Central Command is using heavy-duty B-52 bombers and AC-10 Spectre gunships to attack Taliban positions in Pashtun strongholds of south and east Afghanistan. US planes have also bombed Sheberghan in Jowzan and Lashkar Gah in Helmand. The US forces are to exit Afghanistan on August 31.According to diplomats based in Kabul, it is evident that the Taliban, despite public assurances from neighbouring Pakistan, is in no mood to share power through negotiations and the entire western strategy of the US and the UK has gone to pieces. A peace process meeting scheduled to be held in Islamabad from August 17 to August 19 now stands postponed indefinitely. Primarily, the Islamabad meeting was the brainchild of UK army chief General Nick Carter and the US-Afghan Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad.Also watch | 'Stop Taliban or...': Afghanistan warns world as US, UK ask citizens to exitNow efforts are being made to call Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani on a state visit to Islamabad and have a discreet one to one meeting with the Taliban military council on the sidelines.

It's a pretty cruel disease," said Diego, who did not want to give his full name.He is one of 16 coronavirus patients being treated in the same hospital in Coacalco.Unlike during the first two waves of the pandemic, most of the sick are in their 20s and 30s.Mexico's official Covid-19 death toll of more than 244,000 is the fourth highest in the world, and the actual figure is believed to be significantly higher.The government says that is partly a reflection of the country's large population, but is also due to the prevalence of underlying health problems, including obesity, hypertension and diabetes.The country has registered nearly three million confirmed cases since the pandemic began, of which around 138,000 are active.- No lockdown -Experts say the latest wave of infections is due to the arrival of the Delta variant of the virus, as well as reduced social distancing, particularly among younger Mexicans.The Mexico City authorities on Friday ruled out imposing any new lockdown measures, despite the health ministry raising the capital's alert status to the highest level."Right now it seems that neither the government nor anyone is interested in making people stay at home again," said Jesus Victoria, the head of nursing at the hospital in Coacalco.Although people aged between 18 and 29 began to be vaccinated in late July, it was too late for some of the patients at the clinic, he said."We've been able to discharge most of them, but we have also had many deaths of young people," Victoria said."I don't know if as a society we are failing, if the government is failing. Shopping centers are open, cinemas, sports centers. It complicates things," he added.Thanks to vaccinations, hospitalizations remain far below a peak seen in January when occupancy rose above 90 percent.Now around half of general beds and 58 percent of those equipped with ventilators are available, according to the government.Almost 50 million people in the country of 126 million have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and 27 million of them are fully vaccinated, the health ministry says.- Bars, parties -Hector Lopez, a 26-year-old computer programmer who is also hospitalized for Covid-19, said that in hindsight his family was not careful enough."Usually I don't go out. The problem is that my relatives do," he said."I had been taking care of myself. I hadn't gone out unless it was necessary," he added, as machines monitored his vital signs.Lopez, who is expected to be discharged soon, said he had seen on social media that friends were going out more, despite the risks."It was very easy to see that they were in a bar or at a party as if nothing was happening," he said.Mayra Jimenez, another patient, believes the Delta variant is so infectious that anyone who has avoided catching it without taking extra care is very lucky."We didn't go to parties or gatherings," said the 39-year-old, who is using a medical device to help her lungs recover."Fortunately I came through it okay, but there are people who are in a really bad way," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-variant-no-joke-young-mexicans-warn-from-hospital-101628404448930.html

It was celebrated for the first time in 2002 by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), an animal welfare organisation, one of the largest in the world, based out of Canada.International Cat Day is celebrated to help raise public awareness about cats, to learn about ways to keep and protect them. Many countries also celebrate national cat days to raise awareness about feline adoption. Canada and the US also celebrate national cat day in their countries on August 8 and October 29, respectively. Japan marks national cat day on February 22 and Russia on March 1.In 2020, the custodianship of International Cat Day passed on from IFAW to British non-profit International Cat Care, a charity founded in 1958 by feline lovers working to spread information about cat health and welfare. The organisation states their “Aim is to enable and inspire people to understand cats’ individual needs and perspective, and to act in the interests of each cat’s welfare. We do this by creating and sharing knowledge, insights, skills and current best practice so people can feel confident in their ability to help cats and to challenge ignorance and misconceptions,”Theme of International Cat Day 2021International Cat Care has decided on the campaign ‘Be cat curious’ to celebrate this year’s International Cat Day. The campaign encourages cat owners to spend quality time with their pets and learn more about them. The organisation says 95% of cat owners want more advice on training their cats, with at least half saying they struggled to get their cat into the cat carrier. Hence, this year’s International Cat Day will be celebrated to encourage training for cats and their owners.

The other officer was “fighting for his very life,” Carter said.A large crowd of officers had gathered outside the hospital's ambulance entrance after the shooting. Carter gave the news conference with the gathering as a backdrop, flanked by Mayor Lori Lightfoot who gave her condolences.“The officer who succumbed to her injuries was very young on the job, but incredibly enthusiastic to do the work,” Lightfoot said.Two of the people who were in the vehicle were in custody, Carter said.

08-08-2021||World||Canada relaxes norms for entry of US citizens, permanent residents||Canada is proceeding with its plan to drop restrictions for discretionary travel for American citizens and permanent residents starting on Monday despite a steep surge in Covid-19 cases in the United States.The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) has reiterated the easing of those border measures despite new daily cases in the US crossing 100,000 and Canada itself recording an increase from 250 two weeks earlier to 517 on Saturday .The United States has also not reciprocated and restrictions remain as they were till at least August 21.The Canadian announcement of relaxing norms for Americans came on July 19 and was described as “a first step” towards allowing non-essential travel into the country with easing for all international travellers who are fully vaccinated with a vaccine authorised by Health Canada, and completed their full series at least 14 days prior to entering Canada.At that time, however, the Public Health Agency of Canada said, “Border measures also remain subject to change as the epidemiological situation evolves. As Canada looks to welcome fully vaccinated travellers from the U.S., the federal government will continue to monitor the situation and provide updated travel advice to Canadians.” Cases in America have increased nearly tenfold since that statement.Starting Monday, Canada is doing away with the requirement for air passengers to take an RT-PCR test on arrival in Canada and then quarantine at a government-mandated hotel till the result was available.Canada still requires travellers, including those from the US, to provide a valid pre-arrival molecular test result. Children below 12 are exempted from quarantine as jabs for them are not approved in Canada or America.Meanwhile, direct flights from India remain banned till August 22, though travellers can still come to the country via a third nation but provide the result of an RT-PCR test from the port of departure for their Canadian destination.A release from the CBSA underscored that the US hasn’t placed similar relaxations for Canadians, as it said, “While Canada is moving forward with these measures, it’s important to note that the US is not opening its land border to Canadians for discretionary (non-essential) travel at this time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-relaxes-norms-for-entry-of-us-citizens-permanent-residents-101628399708742.html

The development comes weeks after Pakistan banned TikTok for the fourth time in the country on account of "inappropriate content" on the platform and its failure to take down such videos. Athar Minallah, the chief justice of the IHC, has reportedly asked the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to reconsider the ban on TikTok, especially since the telecommunication regulator has "failed to justify blocking the video-sharing app"."The TikTok app is a source of income for the underprivileged," the report quoted an extract from the judgment passed by the Islamabad high court on Saturday. According to the agency, the telecom regulator has also been asked to submit a report to the court regarding the matter on August 23.The Pakistan Telecommunications Authority had notified on July 21 that it had blocked ByteDance's video-sharing platform TikTok in the country. The ban was imposed under relevant provisions of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016. This was reportedly the fourth time that the app was shown the door in the country. All the earlier bans were reversed when the app promised to moderate its content.The first time TikTok was banned in Pakistan was in October 2020. However, the ban was lifted 10-day later after the company assured that it would block accounts "spreading obscenity".The Peshawar high court had imposed a ban on Tiktok in March which was lifted in April. In June, the Sindh high court asked the telecommunication authority to block TikTok as it was spreading immorality and obscenity. This order was also lifted after three days.TikTok is much popular in Pakistan, though protests against the app have also grown louder over time. The app, which is banned in neighbouring India, has been downloaded almost 39 million times in Pakistan.TikTok has said that more than 6 million videos were removed from the app in Pakistan in the last three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/source-of-income-for-underprivileged-islamabad-high-court-asks-pak-authorities-to-review-tiktok-ban-101628397297375.html

That brings the number of local infections since the latest outbreak began in mid June to 5,169.“Vaccination is the key,” Berejiklian said. She’s aiming to have 6 million people in the state inoculated by the end of the month, up from about 4.4 million ast present.Victoria, whose state capital Melbourne is in its sixth lockdown, announced 11 new cases on Sunday, down from 29 on Saturday. State Premier Daniel Andrews urged Victorians to get vaccinated, saying that’s “critical to us being open and staying open.”There were nine new cases in Queensland, where state Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said a lockdown will ease in the southeast on Sunday. New stay-at-home orders were imposed for three days in the northern city of Cairns.The highly contagious delta variant has caused shutdowns across Australia’s eastern coast, its most populated area. Delta is placing increased pressure on the nation’s so-called “Covid-zero” strategy, which has relied on closed international borders and rigorous testing to eliminate community transmission of the virus.The central bank estimates household spending drops about 15% during lockdown and has acknowledged the economy will likely contract this quarter. Still, it expects a robust recovery to resume, and decided to stick with plans to taper bond purchases for now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-delta-outbreak-continues-as-vaccination-push-ramps-up-101628390165761.html
08-08-2021||World||'Closest neighbour': Pakistan issues statement on India's snub at UNSC meeting on Afghanistan||Pakistan Foreign Office has issued a statement regretting that it was not invited to the United National Security Council meeting on the situation in Afghanistan, despite being the closest neighbour of the conflict-ridden country. Under India's Presidency, the 15-member council held a meeting on the situation of Afghanistan on Sunday where India took a veiled dig at Pakistan for providing safe havens to terrorists. "For enduring peace in Afghanistan, terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries in the region must be dismantled immediately and terrorist supply chains disrupted. It needs to be ensured that Afghanistan’s neighbours and the region are not threatened by terrorism, separatism, and extremism," Indian Ambassador to the UN T S Tirumurti said."Pakistan is the closest neighbour of Afghanistan whose contribution in the ongoing peace process has been recognized by the international community. Pakistan’s constructive efforts with the support of the international community led to important milestones in Doha peace process. Pakistan calls upon all sides in Afghanistan to eschew the military approach and work together to secure an inclusive, broad-based and comprehensive political settlement. It is equally important to remain cognisant of spoilers, both within and outside," Pakistan's foreign office said.Won’t accept a govt imposed by force in Afghanistan: UNSCAt the UNSC discussion, Afghanistan's Permanent Representative to the UN Ghulam Isaczai launched a scathing attack on Pakistan, saying it was providing safe haven and logistical support to the Taliban.Pakistan foreign office, in its statement, said the request to present the country's perspective on the Afghan peace process was not acceded to but the platform was "made available to enable the peddling of a false narrative against Pakistan". "Pakistan categorically rejects these accusations. Pakistan's position on the issue has been shared with Security Council members,” it said adding that its stand on Afghanistan situation remains the same as it believes that there is no military solution to the Afghan conflict and the only way to long-lasting peace lies in political compromise.Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan earlier said Taliban are normal citizens and not any military outfit that the Pakistan army can hunt them down. At the UNSC meeting, the Afghan Ambassador to the UN, Ghulam Isaczai, said Afghanistan is prepared to provide evidence in support of its claim that Pakistan is ensuring a supply chain to the Taliban."Should members of the Security Council want that evidence, we are ready to provide them," Ghulam said adding that evidence was provided to Islamabad as well. "In a deliberate act of barbarism Taliban isn't alone. They're assisted by foreign fighters from transnational terrorist networks. Together they are threatening peace, security and stability in Afghanistan and also in our region and beyond," Isaczai said.The UNSC said the council will not support political structure in the name of the Islamic Emirate (Taliban rule) in Afghanistan again. The UN body also expressed its concern over reports of growing human rights violations in Afghanistan, ANI said quoting Pajhwok Afghan News.As the conflict is going on in Afghanistan, Zaranj, the capital city of Nimroz province, and Shiberghan, the provincial capital of Jawzjan, had fallen to the Taliban and fighting is underway currently in Helmand's capital Lashkargah, Kandahar City and Sar-e-Pul City.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/closest-neighbour-pakistan-issues-statement-on-india-s-snub-at-unsc-meeting-on-afghanistan-101628387308996.html
08-08-2021||World||Biden's $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill passes key hurdle with Senate vote||A huge infrastructure bill deemed historic by US president Joe Biden passed a key procedural hurdle on Saturday, with enough Republican senators joining Democrats to make its final passage in the upper chamber appear nearly certain.The $1.2 trillion bill, designed to fund much-needed upgrades to US roads, highways, bridges, and high-speed internet, drew the support of 18 Republican senators and 49 Democrats, a rare instance of bipartisanship in deeply divided Washington.That Republican support -- with the party's Senate leader Mitch McConnell among the 18 in favor -- will end floor debate on the bill, a procedural step that required 60 votes.With only 51 votes required for final Senate passage, the vote Saturday greatly improves the bill's chances, although fierce wrangling over amendments is continuing.The bill must must pass another procedural step before going to a final vote, the timing of which remained uncertain on Saturday evening, when voting ended to be picked up again Sunday.The legislation, months in the making, calls for $550 billion in new federal spending on the nation's aging infrastructure, including spending to slow the effects of climate change.The total $1.2 trillion price tag -- equal to the 2020 GDP of Spain -- includes some funds previously approved but not yet spent.- Harris on the Hill -Biden, a 36-year veteran of Senate maneuvering, has followed the bill's progress closely, and White House officials said he would not hesitate to phone wavering senators if needed.Making a last-minute plea for passage, Biden tweeted Saturday that the bill represented a "historic, once-in-a-generation investment in our nation's infrastructure.""We can't afford not to do it," he added.Biden also dispatched Vice President Kamala Harris, another former senator, to Capitol Hill Saturday to shore up support for the legislation.If the Senate approves the plan, it will move to the House of Representatives, where passage is not guaranteed. Democrats hold a narrow majority there, and the party's centrist and liberal wings have butted heads over the content of the bill.Final passage by both houses would represent a major victory for the Democratic president, who has been betting his political legacy on economic recovery and the fight against the ravages of Covid-19.Biden's Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, issued a statement Saturday calling the bill "a disgrace."Trump, who was unable to bring an infrastructure bill to passage during his four-year term, added that it would be "very hard" for him to "endorse anyone foolish enough to vote in favor of this deal."His position could make a final vote more problematic for Republicans looking ahead to the 2022 midterm elections.But Republicans also know that the spending in the bill is very popular among voters, according to polls.elc/bbk/sw/bgs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-1-2-trillion-infrastructure-bill-passes-key-hurdle-with-senate-vote-101628385262428.html

The country was averaging about 11,000 cases a day in late June. Now the number is 107,143.The virus is spreading quickly through unvaccinated populations, especially in the Deep South. Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi have had hospitals overrun with patients.The US first crossed the 100,000 average number in November and peaked at about 250,000 in early January before bottoming out in late June.Global deaths estimated to reach 5.3 million by DecThe world will see 5.3mn reported deaths and 12mn excess fatalities by December as the Delta variant drives a surge in cases, according to projections by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).The US-based institute expects deaths to peak at the beginning of September then slowly decline afterwards, it said in a report published on Friday. The IHME’s forecasts distinguish between officially reported Covid-19 deaths and excess deaths attributed to the illness including unreported fatalities. At least 4.3mn have died globally since the start of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deltadriven-surge-new-us-virus-cases-top-100-000-a-day-101628382616213.html
08-08-2021||World||Taliban seize 2nd provincial capital||The Taliban seized the capital of northern Afghanistan’s Jawzjan province on Saturday, a provincial lawmaker said, the second provincial capital to fall to the insurgents in under 24 hours.The deputy governor of Jawzjan province Qader Malia told AFP he was with government forces who had abandoned Sheberghan city and retreated to the airport on its outskirts, where they were preparing to defend themselves.He said Sheberghan had “unfortunately fallen”, but the government denied the claims.Interior ministry spokesman Marwais Stanikzai insisted the insurgents held only parts of the city. “The security forces, backed by reinforcements and the uprising forces, will once again clear the city from the terrorists,” he said in a video message to media.Sheberghan is particularly strategic because it is the stronghold of US-allied Uzbek warlord Rashid Dostum, whose militias are among those resurrected to aid the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces.Aides said he was meeting with President Ashraf Ghani on Saturday in an attempt to persuade the country’s leader to fly in reinforcements.Heavy airstrikes were reported by residents of Sheberghan who also said the Taliban had freed prisoners from the city jail. One resident of Sheberghan contacted by AFP said people were staying behind closed doors, fearful for their future.On Saturday, the US and British embassies in Kabul repeated a warning to its citizens still there to leave “immediately” as the security situation deteriorated. The US air force continues to aid the Afghan air force’s bombing of Taliban targets in southern Helmand and Kandahar provinces as Afghan security forces try to prevent a Taliban takeover.In a report to the UN Security Council on Friday, the UN envoy for Afghanistan urged the council to demand the Taliban immediately stop attacking cities in their offensive to take more territory. Deborah Lyons also called on the international community to urge both sides to stop fighting and negotiate to prevent a “catastrophe” in the country.On Friday, Taliban fighters assassinated Dawa Khan Menapal, the chief of the Afghan government’s press operations for local and foreign media. It came just days after a coordinated attempt was made to kill acting defence chief Bismillah Khan Mohammadi in Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-seize-2nd-provincial-capital-101628380000826.html

International students coming to the United States provide significant and essential value to the higher education system and our economy,” they stressed.Data from the Association of International Educators shows that more than one million international students at US colleges and universities during the 2018-2019 academic year contributed USD 41 billion to the country's economy.Furthermore, bringing international students to the United States enriches the educational experience of domestic students that would be more difficult to achieve through online formats.There are also practical barriers to online learning by international students while physically outside the United States such as not all countries have reliable electricity or internet access and time zone differences require some students to appear online for classes in the middle of the night, the senators said.There are also countries that limit access to certain information or websites while the US also bars the sharing of certain information with other countries, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expedite-process-of-issuing-visas-to-international-students-senators-to-us-govt-101628379795237.html
