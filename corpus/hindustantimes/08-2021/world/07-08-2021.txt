Andrew Cuomo could face misdemeanor charges if investigators substantiate a criminal complaint accusing the governor of groping an aide last year, the Albany County sheriff said Saturday.Sheriff Craig Apple promised a “very comprehensive” investigation but said it would be premature to commit to a timeline or say whether Cuomo himself will be questioned.“We have a lot of factfinding to do. We have a lot of interviews to do," Apple told reporters. "We’re not going to rush this because of who he is. We’re not going to delay this because of who he is.”The complaint, filed this week, is the first known instance where a woman has made an official report with a law enforcement agency over alleged misconduct by the Democratic governor.The aide says Cuomo reached under her shirt and fondled her when they were alone in a room at the Executive Mansion last year. The woman also told investigators with the attorney general’s office that Cuomo once rubbed her rear end while they were posing together for a photo.Cuomo’s lawyer, Rita Glavin, has said the allegation was fabricated.“He is 63 years old. He has spent 40 years in public life and for him to all of the sudden be accused of a sexual assault of an executive assistant that he really doesn’t know, doesn’t pass muster,” Glavin said.Apple declined to release the complaint Saturday but described the allegation as “sexual in nature.” He said his office has a “proven record” of helping victims, adding he does not fear retaliation for moving forward with such a high-profile investigation.“I'm the county sheriff. I'm not going to be intimidated. I'm not going to be coerced,” he said. “That would not play out well for anybody.”Cuomo has faced renewed calls to step down after an independent investigation overseen by the state attorney general’s office concluded he sexually harassed 11 women and worked to retaliate against one of his accusers.The attorney general’s report describes a series of times Cuomo allegedly acted inappropriately with the aide described as Executive Assistant #1, culminating with the groping encounter at the mansion in November 2020.According to the woman, Cuomo pulled her in for a hug as she prepared to leave the governor’s office at the mansion. Told that “you’re going to get us in trouble,” Cuomo replied, “I don’t care,” and slammed the door shut. He slid his hand up her blouse, and grabbed her breast over her bra, according to her account.“I have to tell you, it was — at the moment, I was in such shock that I could just tell you that I just remember looking down seeing his hand, seeing the top of my bra,” she told investigators.She said she pulled away from Cuomo, telling him “You’re crazy.”Apple said he has requested investigative materials from the attorney general's office.“I think we've all read the attorney general's report,” he said. “At this point I'm very comfortable and safe saying she is, in fact, a victim.”Cuomo has adamantly denied touching the woman's breasts, saying “I would have to lose my mind to do such a thing.”The state Assembly’s judiciary committee plans to meet Monday to discuss the possibility of impeachment proceedings against Cuomo. Nearly two-thirds of the legislative body have already said they favor an impeachment trial if he won’t resign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ny-governor-cuomo-could-face-misdemeanor-in-groping-case-says-albany-sheriff-101628356565919.html

It arrived at the GEM in the early hours of Saturday, the ministry said.The boat was transported as a single piece inside a metal cage carried on a remote-controlled vehicle imported especially for the operation, said Atef Moftah, supervisor general of the GEM project.The vessel, discovered in 1954 at the southern corner of the Great Pyramid, has been exhibited for decades at a museum bearing its name at Giza Plateau.Egypt says the Grand Egyptian Museum, which has been under construction intermittently for 17 years, will contain more than 100,000 artifacts when it opens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypts-ancient-king-khufu-s-boat-is-moved-from-giza-pyramids-to-a-new-home-101628355650154.html

Iran responded by walking back measures it had agreed to abide by.Talks have been happening since April in Vienna to find a way to bring both sides back into full compliance.The last round took place on June 20 with no date set for when they would continue. The EU chairs the meetings.The United States has said it is "an urgent priority" to get Iran back to the table.But tensions have risen, notably with an attack by drones last week on an Israeli-linked tanker off Oman that killed a Briton and a Romanian on board.The G7 -- the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan -- blamed the attack on Iran. Tehran denies the accusation.Iranians want 'success'Iran's decisions to increase uranium enrichment and restrict UN inspectors' access to some nuclear facilities have unsettled the West."The EU would like Iran to freeze the nuclear activities," the EU official said, but admitted Russia and China did not back its language on that position.He added that Mora's meeting with Amir-Abdollahian was "very useful", even though many issues remain unclear.The Iranians said they want to get back to Vienna "as soon as possible, not just for talks but to achieve an agreement -- they want a success," the EU official said.He added that the Iranians had not mentioned any changes to their position in the talks, and Mora had informed the United States of the substance of his talks with Amir-Abdollahian."If there is no agreement, the situation for Iran will be much worse," the EU official predicted. "We will work on the assumption we will get an agreement."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-nuke-talks-could-resume-in-early-september-says-eu-official-101628355773688.html

Govt scientific adviser thinks so||The threat of another surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases exists but further lockdowns may not be required in Britain, a government scientific adviser has said.Speaking to Times Radio, John Edmunds, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said he was “cautiously optimistic” that another lockdown won’t be needed even if the UK sees a possible Covid-19 resurgence, fuelled by lives returning to normal.“We’re not doing that this time. But I don’t think we will need to go into a lockdown. I hope not anyway. I very much hope not. I’m cautiously optimistic about that,” he said.Also Read | What are the Covid entry rules for travellers to European countries?After a sharp decline in daily Covid-19 cases, the United Kingdom has been reporting a surge in infections for the past few days. On Friday, Britain recorded 31,808 new Covid-19 cases, a marginal rise from the previous day when it registered 30,093 fresh infections. The infections are expected to rise in September when schools and colleges open for new academic sessions and more workers return to office spaces.“Will we ever return to completely normal behaviour? I don’t know. But there’s a long way to go between the sorts of behaviours that we’re collectively making now and the average behaviour that we were making before the pandemic. There is a big difference,” Edmunds added.On July 19, Britain removed almost all restrictions even as the country continued to report a worrying surge in Covid-19 cases. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government relied on relatively high vaccination coverage to reopen the economy badly hit by months of curbs. More than 57% of the UK population has been fully vaccinated and nearly 12% of the population has received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-uk-never-return-to-lockdowns-govt-scientific-adviser-thinks-so-101628353253565.html

Khalilzad, the Afghan-born US special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, said earlier this week that the Afghan government is too weak to win a negotiated settlement without a new military strategy.“The situation is very concerning, and our expectation is that both the government and the Talibs would focus on a political settlement,” Khalilzad said at the Aspen Security Forum on Tuesday.Also watch | 'Taliban kill woman for not wearing veil'; dark times back in Afghanistan?Khalilzad, known as the architect of the US-Taliban deal for an American troop pullout reached in February 2020, said that it’s now necessary for the government to find its “military bearings” with the Taliban surging.Also read | US urges citizens to immediately leave Afghanistan as Taliban intensifies attackThe special envoy’s comments came on a day a car bomb blast was reported followed by sporadic gunfire in Kabul near the heavily fortified Green Zone. Several civilians and Taliban members died in that attack. Afghan defence minister General Bismillah Mohammadi survived an assassination attempt involving a car bomb and Taliban hit squad.A day later, the Taliban said its fighters had carried out the deadly attack targeting the Afghan defence minister and warned of more "retaliatory operations" against top government officials. Three days later a senior government information official was shot dead in the street. And on Saturday, the Taliban seized Sheberghan city in Jawzjan province, the second provincial capital to fall to the insurgents in less than a day.Also read | Deterioration in security situation in Afghanistan is serious, says JaishankarAs the Taliban is rapidly advancing throughout Afghanistan, experts have expressed apprehension that the insurgents aim to re-establish their harsh brand of Islamist rule, including the repression of women and the independent media, by force. Local media reported earlier this week the Taliban dragged a 21-year-old woman out of a car while she was on her way to the Balkh district centre and shot her dead for not wearing a veil.According to several reports, Islamic fundamentalists have issued diktats forcing women to cover themselves from head to toe, ordering them not to leave home without a male relative. The group has even banned shops in captured areas from selling goods to women not accompanied by a male relative.Khalilzad, who was appointed as the special envoy three years ago, and the then US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said at that time that he would assist “us in the reconciliation effort." A Pashtun like many members of the Taliban, Khalilzad was seen by many as someone who understood the nuances of Afghan culture land and spoke both Pashto and Persian fluently. However, many Afghans have time and again pointed out his advocacy for and business dealings with the Taliban before the September 2001 attacks.In the past, Khalilzad has insisted that the Taliban had changed and said that they were not the same group who deceived the Clinton administration in pre-9/11 diplomacy.Also read | Tensions flare as Taliban gun down top Afghan govt officialBut now the veteran US diplomat has painted a bleak picture of the peace process and said that “at this point, they are demanding that they take the lion's share of power in the next government given the military situation as they see it.”Michael Rubin, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, has said in an opinion piece in the Washington Examiner that it’s time the US recalled Khalilzad home. “His judgment proved wrong, and he has lost control of the process. Rather than interfere where Afghans no longer want him, it is time to investigate the intelligence failures, poor assumptions, and misjudgments that tainted the peace process from day one,” Rubin wrote on Friday.“Khalilzad should spend his days at Senate hearings answering questions about what went wrong and why,” he added.Retired General David Petraeus warned of an “increasingly dire security situation” inside Afghanistan. Gen Petraeus, who oversaw US forces in Afghanistan until 2011 and later headed the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), called the outlook “very, very grim indeed.”The congressionally mandated Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction warned on Tuesday that the US was leaving behind a country which “remains poor, aid-dependent, and conflict-affected, with any potential economic growth in the short term further limited by the lingering effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.”(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-afghanistan-paying-for-zalmay-khalilzad-s-oversights-101628345157544.html

If the city falls, it will be the second provincial capital in as many days to succumb to the Taliban. Several other of the country's 34 provincial capitals are threatened.On Friday, the Taliban took control of the southwestern Nimroz provincial capital of Zaranj, where the government says it is still battling insurgents inside the capital.Sheberghan is particularly strategic because it is the stronghold of US-allied Uzbek warlord Rashid Dostum, whose militias are among those resurrected to aid the Afghan National Security and Defense Forces.Heavy airstrikes were reported by residents of Sheberghan who also said the Taliban had freed prisoners from the city jail. They requested to remain anonymous fearing retaliation from both sides.Taliban fighters have swept through large swathes of Afghanistan at surprising speed, initially taking districts, many in remote areas. In recent weeks they have laid siege to several provincial capitals across the country as the last US and NATO troops leave the country. The US Central Command says the withdrawal is more than 95% complete and will be finished by Aug. 31.The US Air Force continues to aid the Afghan air force's bombing of Taliban targets in southern Helmand and Kandahar provinces as Afghan security forces try to prevent a Taliban takeover.On Saturday, the US and British embassies in Kabul repeated a warning to its citizens still there to leave “immediately” as the security situation deteriorated.On Friday, Taliban fighters assassinated Dawa Khan Menapal, the chief of the Afghan government’s press operations for local and foreign media. It came just days after a coordinated attempt was made to kill acting defense chief Bismillah Khan Mohammadi in a posh and deeply secure neighborhood of the capital.In a report to the UN Security Council on Friday the U.N. envoy for Afghanistan urged the council to demand the Taliban immediately stop attacking cities in their offensive to take more territory.Deborah Lyons also called on the international community to urge both sides to stop fighting and negotiate to prevent a “catastrophe” in the war-torn country.In Afghanistan's Helmand and Kandahar provinces in the south of the country thousands of Afghans were displaced by the fighting and living in miserable conditions.In Helmand's provincial capital of Lashkar Gah, Afghanistan's elite commando forces aided by regular troops were trying to dislodge the Taliban but with little success, said Nafeeza Faiez, a provincial council member. Taliban are in control of nine of the city's 10 police districts.Faiez said conditions for residents are desperate as they hunker down inside their homes, unable to get supplies or get to hospitals for treatment. Many of the public buildings have also been badly damaged in the fighting.“People have no access to any service,” she saidMore than half of Afghanistan’s 421 districts and district centers are now in Taliban hands. While many are in remote regions, some are extremely strategic, giving the Taliban control of lucrative border crossings with Iran, Tajikistan and Pakistan.The insurgent force on Friday closed one of the country's most lucrative borders with Pakistan at Spin Boldak in southeastern Afghanistan. The Taliban were protesting a demand from Pakistan that all Afghans crossing the border must have Afghan passports and Pakistani visas.The group said Pakistan was implementing the demands of the Afghan government and demanded that previous procedures in which identities were rarely checked as people crossed the border be reinstituted.Thousands of Afghans and Pakistanis cross the border daily and a steady stream of trucks passes through, bringing goods to land-locked Afghanistan from the Arabian Sea port city of Karachi in Pakistan.Hundreds of people were waiting Saturday to pass through and more than 600 trucks, many loaded with perishable fresh foods, were backed up in both countries.Islamabad’s relationship with Kabul has been troubled, with both sides accusing each other of harboring militants. Afghan Taliban leaders live in Pakistan and Kabul is bitterly critical of Pakistan for aiding them and treating their fighters in hospitals in Pakistan. Islamabad meanwhile charges that Kabul provides a safe haven to the Pakistani Taliban, a separate militant group that regularly stages attacks in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lawmaker-says-taliban-enter-north-afghan-provincial-capital-sheberghan-101628338987491.html

Official says alerted civil aviation ministry||As the airfares for destinations between India and the United Kingdom have skyrocketed amid peak student season, a government official on Saturday said he has alerted the ministry of civil aviation regarding the issue. Earlier this week, Britain moved India from its “red” to “amber list”, which means fully vaccinated travellers from India will no longer have to go under mandatory 10-day hotel quarantine."The UAE, Qatar, India and Bahrain will be moved from the red list to the amber list. All changes come into effect Sun 8th August at 4 am," UK transport secretary Grant Shapps announced on Twitter.While the UK’s decision has come as a relief for the Indian diaspora who had been demanding the easing of travel norms, the pent up demand due to over three months of travel ban and peak student season has led to a steep rise in airfares.The fare of British Airways for one way travel from Delhi to London on August 26 is ₹3.95 lakh, according to Google Travel. The cost of ticket between the two cities on other airlines, including Air India and Air Vistara range from ₹1.2 lakh to ₹2.3 lakh. Sharing screenshots of minimum airfares between Delhi to London for the economy class, Sanjeev Gupta, secretary at the ministry of home affairs, raised concern about the high prices during college admission time.“Fare of ₹3.95 lakh one way Delhi to London on Aug 26.

While Apple insisted the process is secure and designed to preserve user privacy, not everyone is convinced.“I read the information Apple put out yesterday and I'm concerned. I think this is the wrong approach and a setback for people's privacy all over the world,” tweeted WhatsApp head Will Cathcart.Apple said it will use a perceptual hashing tool, called NeuralHash, that analyses an image and maps it into unique numbers. The system then performs on-device matching using a database of known image hashes of child sexual abuse provided by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and other child-safety organisations. In case a match is found, the image will be manually reviewed and upon confirmation, the user’s account will be disabled and NCMEC will be notified.Also Read | 'Epic is right': Elon Musk slams Apple's app store feesCathcart assured that WhatsApp, which has repeatedly been prompting Indian users to adopt its controversial privacy policy, will not adopt Apple’s approach to combat child sexual abuse. In a series of tweets, he said that WhatsApp reported more than 400,000 cases of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) to NCMEC in 2020 without breaking encryption.There are so many problems with this approach, and it’s troubling to see them act without engaging experts that have long documented their technical and broader concerns with this.WhatsApp chief blasted Apple for using a software that can scan all the private photos on a phone instead of focusing on making it easy for users to report such content shared with them. He raised concerns over the use of the scanning tool in countries like China where laws are broad and vague for considering content illegal.“This is an Apple built and operated surveillance system that could very easily be used to scan private content for anything they or a government decides it wants to control. Countries where iPhones are sold will have different definitions on what is acceptable,” Cathcart added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/setback-for-privacy-whatsapp-on-apple-s-plan-to-scan-iphones-for-images-of-child-abuse-101628333434416.html

There were no reports of casualties in Israel or Gaza.There was no immediate comment from Hamas.Israeli media reported that four fires caused by incendiary balloons broke out Friday afternoon in areas close to the Gaza Strip.The launch of the balloons comes over two months after an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas, the fourth since the militant group seized power in Gaza in 2007.Hamas is upset that Israel has done little to ease a crippling blockade on the territory since the fighting ended and appears to be using incendiary balloons as a pressure tactic. Israel's new prime minister, Naftali Bennet, has compared the balloon launches to rocket fire.Israel and Egypt maintain a blockade of Gaza that includes Israeli control over the territory's coast and airspace and restrictions on the movement of people and goods in and out of the territory. Israel says the closure is needed to prevent Hamas from arming while critics say that the measures amount to collective punishment.

07-08-2021||World||Brazil's president clashes with judiciary, taunts top judge: Report||Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro ignored calls to drop his feud with the Supreme Court on Friday and called one of its justices a "son of a whore," amid rising tensions over his unfounded claims the nation's voting system is vulnerable to fraud.Speaking to supporters in southern Brazil, he insulted Luis Roberto Barroso, the top court justice who also heads the Supreme Electoral Court. The insult was part of a live broadcast shared on Bolsonaro's Facebook account but later deleted. Copies continue to be shared on social media.Bolsonaro has railed for weeks against the electronic urns used in Brazil and pushed for the adoption of printed receipts that can be counted if an election result is disputed.Critics say Bolsonaro, like former U.S. President Donald Trump, is sowing doubts in case he loses next year's presidential election. He has threatened not to accept the result if the system is not changed.With his popularity falling after overseeing the world's second-highest Covid-19 death toll, opinion polls show Bolsonaro trails former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, though neither of them has officially announced they will run.Earlier this week the Supreme Court approved an investigation into the president's unfounded accusations about voter fraud.On Thursday, in Bolsonaro's worst setback in Congress since taking office in 2019, a committee voted to shelve a constitutional amendment he has been pushing that would have adopted printed ballots.Earlier on Friday, Senate President Rodrigo Pacheco criticized Bolsonaro for his attacks on the Supreme Court and offered to mediate, saying the president's insults were unacceptable.Pacheco said Bolsonaro must respect the results of next year's election even if he fails to change the all-electronic voting system - which the president groundlessly claims is vulnerable to tampering."Any threat, however slight, to this democracy will be promptly rejected by the Senate," Pacheco said in a GloboNews television interview.The Senate head said anyone advocating a "democratic retreat" or the suspension of next year's elections would be seen as an "enemy of the nation.""I think a majority in Congress at this moment want to maintain the electronic voting system," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazils-president-clashes-with-judiciary-taunts-top-judge-report-101628320033900.html
07-08-2021||World||Teen diving sensation is now China’s darling||The emerging backstory of Olympic diving champion Quan Hongchan, 14, and her disarming candour after winning the gold medal is being hailed as both inspiring and endearing.China’s youngest athlete at the Tokyo Games, Quan scorched the scoresheet in the individual 10m platform final on Thursday, drowning the competition with three perfect 10s for an overall score of 466.20, which is being described as sensational.Barely into diving for seven years and a relative unknown until Thursday, the teenager is now a household name in China - her story is already the stuff of Chinese sporting legends.Quan is likely to be showered with gifts, money, free passes to zoos and amusement parks - neither of which she has visited until now - and lifetime supplies of her favourite “Latiao”, a local spicy snack in China made of wheat flour and chilli.Quan is from a farmer’s family in a town in south China’s economic powerhouse, Guangdong province.Reports on her in Chinese domestic and social media - where the teenager, unlike in the pool, has made quite a splash in the past couple of days - say that she was discovered by a talent scout while practising diving at school in 2014.If her dives won the medal, her post-win media interaction won hearts. “It seems there is no difference between the Olympics and national competitions. My coach told me to relax and don’t be nervous before the Games,” she was quoted as saying by the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post (SCMP) at the post-win media interaction in Tokyo.The inspiration behind her impulse to dive, as it turns out, wasn’t exactly lofty - she wanted to bunk school. “I feel like I was cheated into starting diving. It’s mainly because I don’t like to go to school, and my grades are poor, but it feels good to dive,” Quan said.When asked about her secrets in being able to dive literally without a ripple on the water, Quan said: “I don’t know, I haven’t compared myself to dumplings!”What broke the Chinese internet and possibly millions of hearts was when Quan spoke about her ill mother, dedicating the win to her. “My mother has been in hospital several times,” Quan told The Paper, a Chinese digital newspaper. “The treatment costs a lot. I feel like I have to earn money to send it home to mom. Mom is ill. I want to make a lot of money, to treat her, and cure her completely.”Quan is likely to get substantial support from Chinese netizens in her endeavour.Interestingly, her compatriot Chen Yuxi who won the silver in the same event is only 15.Australia’s Melissa Wu, 29, whose father is of Chinese origin, took the bronze in the event. Wu, in fact, had won the silver medal for synchronised diving at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/teen-diving-sensation-is-now-china-s-darling-101628320203853.html
07-08-2021||World||Over 3 lakh Afghans internally displaced due to conflict, says UN report||More than 3 lakh Afghans have been displaced internally due to the recent spate of conflicts in the region, the United Nations International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said on Friday. “The IOM estimates that more than 300,000 Afghans have been internally displaced by the recent intensification of the conflict,” said the UN agency in a report.IOM further estimates that around 40,000 people have been fleeing to neighbouring Iran every week. The agency also cautioned that increasing Xenophobia in neighbouring countries and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has been forcing many Afghan refugees to return home. "Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 1.5 million people have been deported from, or opted to leave, neighbouring Pakistan and Iran to return to Afghanistan,” IOM stated.The UN agency has been supporting the returnees who are in dire need of sustenance and shelter as they have spent their very last penny to pay for transportation costs to be able to return home. “IOM will ensure we are prepared for a continued deterioration in the humanitarian situation”, said the agency’s Afghanistan chief Stuart Simpson.Don’t trust the Taliban, says Afghan envoy to China"Now is not the time to turn a blind eye to Afghanistan's critical situation. International attention and advocacy is urgently needed to convey the suffering of Afghan civilians to the world. A negotiated ceasefire remains the best solution for Afghanistan's civilian population to stay safe and potentially create the conditions for improved service delivery and the access required to reach vulnerable persons with care and assistance," Simpson added.Taliban have been waging war in major Afghan cities as US troops prepare for their final leg of withdrawal. Taliban insurgents captured the provincial capital of Zaranj and assassinated the government's senior media officer, Dawa Khan Menapal, in Kabul on Friday. Menapal’s death comes within a month of Reuters photojournalist Danish Siddiqui’s death at Spin Boldak region while on assignment with the Afghan defence forces. Taliban fighters have been laying siege to provincial capitals in the south and west of the country after seizing several key border crossings. The UN envoy for Afghanistan Deborah Lyons told the UN Security Council on Friday that the Taliban’s fighting is taking a “distressing human toll”, with at least 104 civilians killed and 403 wounded in fighting to take Laskhar Gah, the capital of Helmand province since July 28; and more than 460 civilian casualties registered in Kandahar since the start of the offensive there on July 9.The country is also reeling from a severe drought and intense humanitarian crisis. The UN estimates around 18.5 million people, almost half the country’s population, will be in need of humanitarian assistance this year to cope with the ongoing multifaceted crisis, caused by conflict, a global pandemic, and widespread under-development and poverty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-3-lakh-afghans-internally-displaced-due-to-conflict-says-un-report-101628318797997.html
07-08-2021||World||US now averaging 100,000 new Covid-19 infections a day||The US is now averaging 100,000 new Covid-19 infections a day, returning to a milestone last seen during the winter surge in yet another bleak reminder of how quickly the delta variant has spread through the country.The US was averaging about 11,000 cases a day in late June. Now the number is 107,143.It took the U.S. about nine months to cross the 100,000 average case number in November before peaking at about 250,000 in early January. Cases bottomed out in June but took about six weeks to go back above 100,000, despite a vaccine that has been given to more than 70% of the adult population.The virus is spreading quickly through unvaccinated populations, especially in the South where hospitals have been overrun with patients.Health officials are fearful that cases will continue to soar if more Americans don’t embrace the vaccine.“Our models show that if we don’t (vaccinate people), we could be up to several hundred thousand cases a day, similar to our surge in early January,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Rochelle Walensky said on CNN this week.The number of Americans hospitalized with the virus has also skyrocketed and it has gotten so bad that many hospitals are scrambling to find beds for patients in far-off locations.Houston officials say the latest wave of Covid-19 cases is pushing the local health care system to nearly “a breaking point,” resulting in some patients having to be transferred out of the city to get medical care, including one who had to be taken to North Dakota.Dr. David Persse, who is health authority for the Houston Health Department and EMS medical director, said some ambulances were waiting hours to offload patients at Houston area hospitals because no beds were available. Persse said he feared this would lead to prolonged respond times to 911 medical calls.“The health care system right now is nearly at a breaking point ... For the next three weeks or so, I see no relief on what’s happening in emergency departments,” Persse said Thursday.Last weekend, a patient in Houston had to be transferred to North Dakota to get medical care. An 11-month-old girl with Covid-19 and who was having seizures had to be transported on Thursday from Houston to a hospital 170 miles (274 kilometers) away in Temple.In Missouri, 30 ambulances and more than 60 medical personnel will be stationed across the state to help transport Covid-19 patients to other regions if nearby hospitals are too full to admit them, Missouri Gov. Mike Parson announced Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-now-averaging-100-000-new-covid-19-infections-a-day-101628316393561.html
07-08-2021||World||Taliban enforce Sharia in Ghazni, Pak plays double and Afghanistan in flux||Military situation continues to be fluid in Afghanistan with government security forces waged in a fierce battle with Taliban all over the country and Pakistan playing a double game of facilitating peace and simultaneously supporting the war effort of the Sunni Pashtun Islamic fundamentalist group.In fact, there is a sense of deja vu among Afghan people as Taliban 2.0 have neither changed their tactics nor enforcement of Sharia law since they last captured Kabul 25 years ago. Pakistan, meanwhile, continues to play on both sides and the western powers led by the US have no definite plan to tackle the military occupation of Afghanistan by the Pakistan supported fundamentalist force. The military flux situation has led to foreign terrorists from Pakistan, Xinjiang and Uzbekistan migrating to the Taliban held territories in east and north Afghanistan and it is only a matter of time when these terrorist groups start targeting democracies under the protection of the Sunni medieval force. Till Friday, 218 districts in Afghanistan are under the control of Taliban, while the national government holds 120. The number of contested districts stands at 99.Ground intelligence reports reaching Delhi indicate that the Taliban have issued a fatwa in Badakhshan, Takhar and Ghazni provinces that girls above the age of 12 and widows can be taken by their fighters. They are also targeting families of security forces, conducting house-to-house searches and looting properties. Foreign terrorists are freely operating under the Taliban umbrella, including those affiliated to Al Qaeda, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, East Turkestan Islamic Movement and Islamic Movement of Uzebkistan. A 21-year-old woman was dragged out of her car at Balkh district centre and killed by Taliban fighters for not wearing a burqa (veil).Neighbouring Pakistan, meanwhile, has adopted a two-pronged strategy. It is part of an US/UK effort to invite Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on a state visit to Islamabad ostensibly to talk peace with senior Taliban leaders like first Deputy Emir Mullah Yaqub (son of Mullah Omar) and Haqqani network chief Sirajuddin Haqqani, who is also the sword arm of Taliban. At the same time, Pakistani drones are in action in Jalalabad and in Nangarhar province conducting reconnaissance and watching the live action on ground.With a thankless task of stablising Afghanistan, the US has set up a Security Defence Cooperation Management Office in Qatar to support the Afghan security forces. Preparing for a worst case scenario, Washington has also advised Afghan leaders to present a united front in defence of the country's government, gain public trust and take the peace process forward. The envisaged platform would include HCNR chairman Abdullah Abdullah, Hazara leader Ustad Mohammad Mohaqiq and former Mujahideen leaders Ustad Abdul Rab Rasoul Sayyaf, Ismail Khan, Atta Mohammed Noort, Younis Qanooni, Uzbek leaders Enayatullah Babur and Batur Dostum, sone of Rashid Dostum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-enforce-sharia-in-ghazni-pak-plays-double-and-afghanistan-in-flux-101628315004180.html

Anyone was fine, I just wanted to kill a lot of people."Other media, including broadcaster NHK, reported similar quotes from suspect.A police spokesman said they had nothing further to share on the details of case when asked about the media reports on Saturday.Violent crime is rare in Japan but there have been a spate of knife attacks by assailants unknown to the victims.In June 2008, a man in a light truck drove into a crowd in the popular Akihabara district and then jumped out of the vehicle and started stabbing pedestrians, leaving seven dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/knife-attacker-on-tokyo-commuter-train-wanted-kill-women-who-looked-happy-101628313200483.html

According to the outlet Global News, there have been 206 such cases reported in Canada, a small fraction of the number of doses of the vaccine administered in the country.Health Canada added that the vaccine label for the other mRNA vaccine authorised in the country, manufactured by Moderna, “already contains safety information” about this possible outcome and that it is “continuing to assess this issue for all authorised Covid-19 vaccines in Canada”.Bell’s Palsy, it noted, is an episode of facial muscle weakness or paralysis and the condition is typically temporary. Symptoms appear suddenly and generally start to improve after a few weeks. The exact cause is unknown. It’s believed to be the result of swelling and inflammation of the nerve that controls muscles on one side of the patient’s face.Despite these adverse events, it stressed that Covid-19 “vaccines continue to be safe and effective” and their benefits “continue to outweigh their potential risks”.In fact, the number of cases reported of adverse reactions to all vaccines approved in the country is tiny. According to data from the Public Health Agency of Canada of the total 11,471 individual reports of reactions, 8,622 were considered non-serious while 2,849 were considered serious but comprised just 0.006% of all doses administered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizerbiontech-covid-vaccine-canada-issues-advisory-on-adverse-reaction-101628312223281.html

The IHME’s forecasts distinguish between officially reported Covid-19 deaths and excess deaths attributed to the illness including unreported fatalities.There have been almost 4.3 million deaths from Covid-19 globally since the start of the pandemic, according to the World Health Organization.The delta variant is associated with viral loads that are more than 1,200 times higher in newly infected individuals compared with the original coronavirus strain, which means that delta can spread as easily as chickenpox. Studies from the U.K. have also shown that delta, which was discovered in India in October, is more resistant to vaccines than the alpha variant that emerged in England in late 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-covid-deaths-estimated-to-reach-5-3-million-by-december-101628305623388.html

But after peaking in April, the rate of people getting vaccinated each day fell off sharply.This aggressive vaccination program had raised hopes of a return to some semblance of normal life this summer, but in the end, this did not pan out because of the Delta variant.Daily new cases, deaths, and hospitalizations are up sharply in recent weeks, and cities like New York and Los Angeles are imposing new restrictions such as demanding proof of vaccination for entering indoor venues like restaurants and gyms.Last week there was an average of 90,000 new coronavirus cases per day. Florida and Texas accounted for a third of them, the White House said.For four straight weeks, the average number of people getting vaccinated each day has risen, White House Covid-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/half-of-us-population-now-fully-vaccinated-against-covid-19-white-house-101628301581312.html

The killing of one of the government’s leading voices follows a bloody day of fighting in Afghanistan.In another major blow for the Afghan government, a police spokesman in southern Nimroz province said the capital Zaranj has fallen to the insurgents.“The savage terrorists have committed a cowardly act once again and martyred a patriotic Afghan,” interior ministry spokesman Mirwais Stanikzai said of the death of Dawa Khan Menapal. Menapal used to openly slam the Taliban.The Taliban claimed responsibility for the death, with spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid saying the killing was a “special attack carried out by the mujahideen”.Fighting in Afghanistan has intensified since May, when foreign forces began the final stage of a withdrawal.Taliban capture first provincial capitalThe Taliban on Friday captured their first provincial capital since launching an offensive to coincide with the departure of foreign troops, a major blow to an Afghan government desperately trying to push back the insurgents. “Zaranj, provincial capital of Nimroz, has fallen to the Taliban,” Roh Gul Khairzad, the deputy governor of Nimroz, told AFP. She said the city - in southwest Afghanistan near the Iranian border - had been taken “without a fight”, and social media showed clips of insurgents roaming the streets, being cheered by residents.Don’t trust the Taliban: Afghan envoy to ChinaAfghanistan’s envoy to China has questioned Taliban’s pledge to Beijing on not harbouring militants seeking to separate Xinjiang. “I don’t think even China believes in that (the promise),” Javid Ahmad Qaem told Reuters in an interview in Beijing, adding that the Taliban were “only saying this to get regional support”.(With inputs from Sutirtho Patranobis)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tensions-flare-as-taliban-gun-down-top-afghan-govt-official-101628291798292.html
