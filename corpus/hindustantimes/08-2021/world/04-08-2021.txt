The new rollout will include 1.4 million teenagers across the UK.“In the last few weeks, there have been large changes in the way Covid-19 has been spreading in the UK, particularly in younger age groups. The adult vaccine programme has progressed very successfully and more safety data has become available, so it was important to review the advice for the vaccination of children and young people,” a statement issued by Public health England said on Wednesday. It added that young people will get 80% protection against hospitalisations, after being inoculated with the first vaccine dose.Health experts have welcomed the decision by saying it is an important step for protecting the young and reducing the transmission of Covid-19Accepting the JCVI’s recommendation on vaccinating young people aged 16 and above, health secretary Sajid Javid said on Wednesday that he has instructed the National Health Service (NHS) to prepare to vaccinate those eligible at the earliest.However, the vaccination committee has not yet recommended administering doses to children below 16 years. “JCVI will continue to review data and provide updates on at-risk groups aged 12-15 and whether any additional groups will be added,” Sajid said in a statement. At present, the UK has only approved vaccination of children above 12 years only with an underlying health condition or who live with a vulnerable person.Other countries in Europe, including France and Germany, and also the United States have already approved inoculations for children above 12 years.As of Wednesday, authorities in the UK have vaccinated 85,661,367 beneficiaries so far of which nearly 47 million have received the first dose and the remaining 38,733,334 are fully vaccinated, according to the bulletin shared by the Department of Health and Social Care.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukto-administer-covid-19-vaccines-to-healthy-16-and-17yearolds-101628097596947.html

It was also his first visit to Tibet as President.Opened on June 25, the 435-kilometre-long railway line has a designed speed of 160 km per hour. It reduces the travel time from Lhasa to Nyingchi from 5 hours to approximately 3.5 hours.China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of South Tibet, which is firmly rejected by India. The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC).

04-08-2021||World||UK to rollout Covid-19 vaccines for adolescents aged 16, 17||The UK is to offer coronavirus vaccines to 16 and 17-year-olds in the coming weeks after the independent body of scientists that makes recommendations over the rollout changed its advice.The four nations of the UK all accepted the change in advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization for healthy 16 to 17-year-olds to be offered a first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. They will not need the consent of parents.The change, which means another 1.4 million people across the UK will be eligible for a first dose of vaccine, comes just two weeks after the JCVI recommended against routine vaccination of anyone under the age of 18 though did stress that it would continually assess the evidence.Currently, the only 16 and 17-year-olds being offered the Pfizer vaccine, which has been approved by Britain’s medical regulator for use for anyone aged 12 and over, are those with underlying health conditions or those living with vulnerable people.The timeline for when they will get their second dose has yet to be determined but further recommendations based on the evidence of how the response to the first dose has been will emerge in coming weeks.“While COVID-19 is typically mild or asymptomatic in most young people, it can be very unpleasant for some and for this particular age group, we expect one dose of the vaccine to provide good protection against severe illness and hospitalization,” said Professor Wei Shen Lim, who chairs the JCVI's Covid-19 program.While the British rollout of vaccines has been one of the world’s fastest, with 73% of the adult population fully vaccinated, it has been fairly tardy in offering jabs to youths. There have been growing calls for the vaccination drive to be expanded following a spike in infections this summer as a result of the spread of the more transmissible delta variant and the lifting of lockdown restrictions.Despite Wednesday’s change, the UK still lags many other European countries such as France and Germany, which are offering vaccines to children aged 12 and over.The JCVI said it will continue to keep its position under review on vaccinating under-16s without underlying health conditions or those not living with people who are immunocompromised.Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, England’s deputy chief medical officer, said there was “no time to waste" and that he expects the rollout to start in “a very short number of weeks."Schools across the UK are closed for the summer holidays, with most reopening in early September. However, students are set to return to schools in Scotland in the next couple of weeks.Wei Shen Lim, the JCVI's chair, said there had been feedback from young people who want to have the choice to get a coronavirus vaccine.“So, they’d like to be offered the vaccine, understand the risks and potential benefits, and therefore make a choice for themselves whether they want to have it or not," he said.The expanded rollout comes amid evidence that the vaccination drive among younger adults has slowed down in recent weeks, a trend that's prompted the British government to offer incentives, such as discounts and even free slices of pizza to persuade young people to roll up their sleeves and get the shot.There are many younger people who have opted against getting a jab because the evidence is clear that they are much less likely to get anything more than mild symptoms of Covid-19.“I would just urge all families thinking about this across the country to listen to the JCVI," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said while on a visit to Scotland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-rollout-covid-19-vaccines-for-adolescents-aged-16-17-101628094318261.html

The groom was among the 12 persons injured."Several lightning bolts within few seconds hit the boat carrying the wedding party revellers, killing 16 of them instantly," Chief Administrative Officer Sakib Al Rabby told reporters at Shibganj.The bride was not with the wedding party, he said.Rabby said the mishap took place as the revellers were disembarking from the boat one by one to take refuge at a shelter due to sudden monsoon rains that brought with it the unexpected thunderbolts.The bridegroom survived the disaster, but he was injured along with 11 others, the officer said, adding that the wounded are being treated at a government hospital with burn wounds.Lightning strikes, especially in monsoon season, kill hundreds of people every year in Bangladesh. The country in 2016 declared lightning strikes a natural disaster, though many thunderstorm deaths are never officially recorded.In 2016, over 200 people, including 82 on a single day, died in the month of May alone due to lightning strikes. Most of them were farmers and died while working in their fields.Experts attribute the rise in fatal lightning strikes to deforestation. According to them tall trees would have drawn lightning strikes.The monsoon rains in recent weeks have ravaged southeastern Cox's Bazar, leaving 20 people dead, including six Rohingya refugees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/16-killed-as-lightning-strikes-wedding-party-in-bangladesh-101628094545869.html

WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus highlighted the vaccine disparity as rich countries are moving swiftly to plan booster doses for their citizens.Tedros told a press briefing that 80% of the vaccine doses administered globally have gone to high- and upper-middle-income countries, while low- and lower-middle-income countries are struggling to vaccinate even their healthcare workers and high-risk groups. He stressed that hundreds of millions of unvaccinated people require Covid-19 vaccines urgently as they cannot afford to stay home."I understand the concern of all governments to protect their people from the Delta variant. But we cannot accept countries that have already used most of the global supply of vaccines using even more of it, while the Earth globe Europe-Africa's most vulnerable people remain unprotected," the WHO chief said.Also Read | These countries have made Covid-19 vaccination mandatory amid Delta surgeTedros stressed the need for an urgent reversal of vaccination supply, saying a majority of vaccines are going to high-income countries when low-income countries have only been able to administer “1.5 syringe for every 100 people.” Referring to his earlier call for global support to enable countries to vaccinate at least 10% of their population, the WHO chief lamented that they aren’t on track to achieve the target."Accordingly, WHO is calling for a moratorium on boosters until at least the end of September, to enable at least 10% of the population of every country to be vaccinated," Tedros said, adding that the plan needs the cooperation of a "handful of countries and companies that control the global supply of vaccines."Underscoring the importance of G20 countries in fighting the pandemic, Tedros said that the "course of the pandemic depends on the leadership of the G20 countries." He also urged everyone with "influence", including Olympics athletes and business and faith leaders, to call for the moratorium on booster shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-calls-for-moratorium-on-covid-booster-shots-as-delta-variant-threatens-lives-101628092019266.html
04-08-2021||World||These countries have made Covid-19 vaccination mandatory amid Delta surge||The spread of the highly contagious Delta variant of coronavirus and slowdown in vaccination rates have prompted several countries to make vaccination mandatory for certain groups, including health workers and people at high risk. During the initial days of vaccine rollout, governments around the world have said that the vaccination will not be made compulsory but encouraged people to get jabbed.However, the rise in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases largely driven by the Delta variant has threatened the gains made through vaccination and other social distancing measures. Australia, known for its relatively successful Covid-19 response, has been witnessing a worrying surge in infections. In late June, Australia made vaccinations mandatory for high-risk aged-care workers and employees in quarantine hotels in the wake of Delta variant spread.Here are some of the countries with compulsory vaccination policy for certain groups:BritainRelying on high vaccination rates, Britain removed almost all restrictions from July 19 amid the Covid-19 surge. It has made vaccination mandatory for care home workers in England from October. Those attending English nightclubs and large events will have to present a certificate of full vaccination from September end.United StatesFrom September 13, New York City will require proof of vaccination from customers and staff at restaurants, gyms and other indoor businesses. New York has mandated its state employees to either get vaccinated or get tested on a weekly basis from September 6. Several other US states have issued similar guidelines for government employees, health workers, and other groups as the Delta variant threatens to jeopardise the country’s Covid-19 response.All civilian federal workers will also need to get vaccinated and undergo regular testing, social distancing, mask requirements and travel limits, reported news agency Reuters citing people familiar with the matter.Also Read | China pushes to vaccinate minors against Covid-19 amid surge in Delta casesFranceOn Monday, the French parliament approved a bill to make vaccinations mandatory for health workers. A penalty will also be imposed on businesses that do not check whether their clients have a health pass.Saudi ArabiaSaudi Arabia has mandated vaccination for all public and private sector workers wishing to attend a workplace but hasn't specified the date of implementation. The Gulf nation has also made vaccination a requirement to enter any government, private, or educational establishments.RussiaMoscow recently unveiled a plan requiring at least 60% of all service sector workers fully vaccinated by August 15, reported the Moscow Times.IndonesiaIndonesia is witnessing its worst Covid wave. In February, the country made vaccinations mandatory but less than 15% of its population has been fully vaccinated so far. Jakarta has threatened to impose fines of up to $357 for refusing the Covid-19 vaccine.ItalyThe EU member state has mandated all health workers, including pharmacists, to get vaccinated. Those refusing vaccines could be suspended for the rest of the year without pay.HungaryHungary's government has also decided to make vaccinations mandatory for healthcare workers.LebanonThose visiting restaurants, cafes, pubs and beaches have to show proof of vaccination or negative antibody test result.

He was found dead in his dormitory on July 29.The deceased’s autopsy has been completed and an official from the Indian embassy in Beijing who went to Tianjin, 100km from here, is coordinating with local police and authorities to secure an early release of the body.Efforts were on to persuade the local police to release the body at the earliest to make arrangements to ship it to India in the coming days. The transportation of the deceased’s body back to India could cost thousands of dollars.Several questions about the crime remain unanswered including the motive behind it, the exact time of the incident and whether the university had done - or is doing - enough for the safety and security of foreign students staying on campus.Indian embassy officials have remained tight-lipped about the case other than responding to a senior BJP leader’s tweet about it.On Wednesday, the Chinese foreign ministry refused to share more details on the case. “The case is under investigation, and the details cannot be released at the moment,” the Chinese foreign ministry said to HT.The ministry was responding to a list of questions sent to them by HT on the crime. “Relevant Chinese authorities will handle the case according to law,” the statement said. “As for the repatriation of the body, relevant Chinese authorities will stay in communication with the Indian side and cooperate.”On Tuesday, the ministry said that Nagsen’s death was a homicide and a foreign student had been arrested in connection with the murder.The suspect’s nationality has not been disclosed so far.The transportation of the body back to India will take a while as currently there are no direct flights operating between India and China and it has to be repatriated through a third country, officials said.China has also tightened travel restrictions in view of the spike in Covid-19 cases in the past few days. “Let them continue the investigation after sending the remains home. We beg the Chinese and Indian authorities,” the deceased’s uncle Pankaj Paswan had said from Gaya on Tuesday.Despite the serious nature of the crime, which took place on the campus of a reputed university, Chinese media has blanked out the news about the case. Even well-known state-run English outlets like China Daily and the tabloid Global Times seemed to have skipped it until Wednesday night, a week after the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/murder-of-indian-student-in-china-talks-on-to-get-the-body-released-101628090623768.html

However, Pakistan NSA Yusuf did not elaborate on his options.This comment comes amid Islamabad's growing frustration over Joe Biden's snub to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan. Biden hasn't called Khan since he assumed office in January this year."The president of the United States hasn't spoken to the prime minister of such an important country who the US itself says is make-or-break in some cases, in some ways, in Afghanistan -- we struggle to understand the signal, right?" Yusuf said, as quoted by Dawn newspaper."We've been told every time that... [the phone call] will happen, it's technical reasons or whatever. But frankly, people don't believe it," he said. "If a phone call is a concession, if a security relationship is a concession, Pakistan has options," he added.Despite efforts from Pakistan NSA, Islamabad's ties with the US remains in a critical state. Top Pak top officials have been holding a series of meetings with the top US administration officials but 'divergent' views on Afghanistan and China have proved to be a hurdle between both the countries, The Nation reported citing a diplomatic source."Divergent views on Afghanistan and China factor are the reason for tense ties between Islamabad and Washington, after the meeting, the US National Security Adviser's tweet was focused on Afghanistan while there was no mention of Afghanistan in Dr Moeed Yousaf's tweet," the source informed.The US has urged Islamabad to put pressure on the Taliban, however, the Pakistan side made it clear that they do not have any control over the Taliban.In FT interview, Pak NSA complained about the US President's failure to contact Imran Khan as Washington sought help to stop the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan.Meanwhile, an official from the Biden administration told FT: "There are still a number of world leaders President Biden has not been able to speak with personally yet. He looks forward to speaking with Prime Minister Khan when the time is right."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-has-other-options-nsa-yusuf-tells-us-over-biden-snub-101628077430731.html
04-08-2021||World||Japan: Moderate Covid patients to isolate at home instead of hospitals as per new govt policy||Japan’s government is introducing a contentious new policy in which coronavirus patients with moderate symptoms will isolate at home instead of in hospitals, as new cases surge in Tokyo to record levels during the Olympic Games.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s plan, which aims to save hospital beds almost exclusively for those with serious symptoms or at risk of developing them, is a major policy shift as new cases in the capital have more than tripled since the Olympics began on July 23.Tokyo reported 4,166 new cases on Wednesday, an all-time high since the pandemic began early last year.The new policy, introduced this week, was debated in parliament on Wednesday. Opposition as well as some governing party lawmakers and experts charged that the lives of people isolating at home without adequate care would be at risk.Suga, who has been criticized for insisting on hosting the Olympics despite public virus fears, says there is no evidence linking the upsurge in cases to the Games.He defended the home isolation policy as a way to ensure that hospital care is available for seriously ill patients, and said the new plan is only for areas where hospitals are severely strained.Infections, propelled by the more contagious delta variant, could accelerate to 10,000 a day by mid-August, some experts say. They called for a current state of emergency in Tokyo and five other areas to be expanded nationwide. The emergency measures, which focus on alcohol bans and shorter hours for eateries, are increasingly ignored by the public, which has tired of restrictions.NHK public television and other media reported that Suga is expected to expand a milder version of the emergency measures to 13 prefectures from the current five.“The pandemic has now entered a new phase,” Health Minister Norihisa Tamura said in parliament. “Hospital capacity is limited."He defended the home isolation policy as necessary to prevent a medical collapse similar to what happened in April in Osaka, when thousands of people became sicker and some died at home while waiting for hospital beds.Tamura, cautioning against a repeat of that situation, urged people to avoid all non-essential outings to slow infections.In Tokyo, more than 14,000 patients with mild symptoms are currently isolating at home — more than a 10-fold increase from a month ago — and about 8,400 others are waiting for beds in hospitals or special hotels.Opposition lawmakers criticized Suga for not increasing hospital capacity sufficiently despite warnings about the fast-spreading delta variant. Coronavirus treatment in Japan is limited to public and university hospitals that have adequate facilities and expertise.“Lives that can be saved will be lost,” said Kazunori Yamanoi, a lawmaker from the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, calling isolation at home “abandonment.”Dr. Shigeru Omi, the government's top medical adviser, said patients at risk of developing serious symptoms while staying at home will need to be given proper support by community physicians who make household visits.Suga said vaccinations of elderly people have significantly reduced infections and that he plans to accelerate immunizations for younger people and inoculate 40% of the entire population by the end of August.Experts say higher vaccination rates are needed to control the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-limit-hospital-care-as-covid-19-cases-hit-new-high-101628082636835.html

While US President Joe Biden has rejected his predecessor’s approach to North Korea and its nuclear program, Pyongyang has been giving mixed signals to the new administration for restarting the talks.Park Jie-won, South Korea’s head of the National Intelligence Service (NIS), briefed the lawmakers on the matter a week after Pyongyang and Seoul restored hotlines suspended a year ago by North Korea, reported news agency Reuters. Citing the briefing by Park, Ha Tae-Keung, a member of the parliamentary intelligence committee, told reporters that North Korea has put some preconditions to reopen talks, including the lifting of sanctions banning exports of minerals and imports of refined oil and other necessities."I asked which necessities they want the most, and they said high-class liquors and suits were included, not just for Kim Jong Un's own consumption but to distribute to Pyongyang's elite," Reuters quoted the lawmaker as saying.Also Read | North Korea's Kim Jong Un seen with head bandage, sparks yet another round of health speculationUS secretary of state Antony Blinken has planned to participate in virtual meetings with his Southeast Asian counterparts where he will call on ASEAN countries to fully implement the sanctions on North Korea, state department spokesperson Ned Price said on Monday, indicating that Washington is not willing to lift any sanctions as a precondition to restart talks with Pyongyang.Price said the next day that the US welcomes the restoration of inter-Korean communication lines and is willing to meet North Korean leaders “anytime, anywhere, without preconditions.”“It’s up to [North Korea] to respond positively to that outreach,” he added.The UN Security Council has passed resolutions imposing a wide range of sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear programs and intercontinental ballistic missiles tests.

Indonesia is the second country in Asia after India to reach this grim milestone. Health ministry data showed that Indonesia recorded 1,747 deaths in the past 24 hours, pushing the cumulative count to 100,636.Indonesia has now joined the list of countries including India and Brazil which have lost more than 100,000 people due to Covid-19 since the beginning of the pandemic last year.According to news agency Associated Press, it took 14 months for Indonesia to cross the 50,000-mark at the end of May this year, and just more than two months to double it. However, experts have pointed out the real figures are greater than what the official data shows.Indonesia has been grappling with a severe shortage of oxygen to treat critical patients. Hospitals across have been running out of beds because of which many of such patients are dying either by isolating at home or waiting to receive urgent care. The World Health Organization (WHO) earlier said that hospitals require more isolation rooms, oxygen supplies, medical and personal equipment and also body bags and mobile field hospitals.Since June, over 2,800 people have died during self-isolation at home, according to data presented by crowd sourcing platform LaporCovid-19, which keeps track of deaths at home. “They were rejected by the hospitals, so they went back home and did the self-isolation at home with limited access to medicine, no oxygen and no monitoring from doctors until they died,” Ahmad Arif, one of the founding members of LaporCovid-19, told the Associated Press.And in July, when the highly infectious Delta variant emerged, more than 30,000 deaths were reported in the country, over triple than the 7,914 deaths seen in June. The government in July had implemented the strictest curbs on movement in Java island and Bali to curb the spread of Covid-19, and further introduced similar curbs across the country.Even though the government is now speeding up its vaccination rollout and has diverted most of the industrial oxygen production for medical use and has come up with more isolation rooms and field hospitals, the situation still remains critical.Just 8% of the total 270 million in Indonesia have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, and the government is aiming to administer 2.5 million doses a day in August and in September, according to Bloomberg.Recently, the country started receiving jabs from Pfizer and Moderna through the COVAX programme and other bilateral deals. Among those people who haven’t been inoculated, 80% said they were waiting for a slot, are looking out for available vaccines or haven’t been vaccinated due to other reasons, Bloomberg further reported.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesias-covid-19-toll-breaches-100-000-1-747-deaths-seen-in-last-24-hrs-101628078352739.html
04-08-2021||World||China pushes to vaccinate minors against Covid-19 amid surge in Delta cases||China has begun to urgently promote its Covid-19 vaccination campaign among minors as authorities try to control a surge in cases driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus. More than 450 people have been infected in two weeks, with the latest outbreak spreading to at least 18 provinces and sending millions into lockdown.As many as 71 new domestic cases were reported on Wednesday for the previous day, the highest daily count in China since January.China is scrambling to contain the new outbreak, which started from the eastern city of Nanjing in the third week of July, but has since triggered pockets of resurgence in cities such as Beijing and Wuhan where the coronavirus first emerged in late 2019. Cities such as Nanjing, Zhengzhou and Wuhan have ordered mass testing of all residents - in Nanjing’s case, the fourth round of testing is currently ongoing.Authorities feel vaccinating minors could help in containing the outbreak.A vaccination campaign for minors aged between 12 and 17 should be expanded across the country, an education ministry notice issued on Tuesday said.Vaccination should be promoted to all eligible students below the age of 18, the notice, quoted by official media, said.The anti-Covid jabs should be administered both with consent of the students or their guardians, the notice added.China administered about 19.2 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines on August 2, bringing the total shots given to 1.689 billion doses, data from the national health commission (NHC) said on Tuesday - the highest number in the world.A few Chinese provinces had announced vaccination plans for the 12-17 age group in July, but the campaign hadn’t really taken off among teenagers.However, the sudden surge in cases of the Delta variant has pushed authorities to promote the campaign as teenagers are considered to be an important part of the effort to build herd immunity in society.Tao Lina, a Shanghai-based vaccine expert, told the state-run tabloid Global Times that children and teenagers are key groups for China to achieve herd immunity, and most teens do not have immunity to Covid-19, so vaccination could protect them against severe symptoms and death.Meanwhile, China has “imposed massive travel restrictions, including temporary closure of airports and travel alerts for citizens to other places across the country”, to contain the ongoing outbreak, news agency Xinhua reported on Wednesday.All 31 provincial-level regions in the Chinese mainland have urged citizens not to go to medium and high-risk areas for Covid-19 or leave the provinces where they live unless it is necessary.By Tuesday afternoon, China had four high-risk areas and 125 medium-risk areas for Covid-19.Meanwhile, China’s gambling hub, Macau, will test its 600,000 people and close some entertainment spots after four new coronavirus cases, its government said on Wednesday.The latest resurgence in cases in a city that has seen very few infections over the past year and a half has raised concerns that casinos, Macau’s main economic engine and source of revenues, may have to close in the near-term if the spread is not contained, Reuters reported.Mainland China had recorded 93,289 confirmed cases by Tuesday. The overall death toll was 4,636.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-pushes-to-vaccinate-minors-against-covid-19-amid-surge-in-delta-cases-101628071962619.html
04-08-2021||World||Herd immunity unlikely in our lifetimes, should be heading UK's way: Expert||People should avoid using the term ‘herd immunity’ in the context of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as it is unlikely to materialise during our lifetimes, an expert has warned. Herd immunity is a stage where a certain percentage of the population gets infected with the virus and develops immunity against it, breaking the transmission chain. It interrupts the transmission chain and the virus spread is brought to an almost absolute halt.Herd immunity was one of the most talked-about concepts, and many believed that the world will reach a stage where the virus will get eliminated. In an article for The Conversation, Shabir A. Madhi, dean faculty of health sciences and professor of vaccinology at the University of the Witwatersrand, has now said that the virus is unlikely to be eliminated.Madhi listed several reasons that, he said, have forced a shift in our thinking about herd immunity, including the mutations making the virus more transmissible and their ability to evade vaccine-induced immunity. The inequitable distribution of vaccines across the world, with low- and lower-middle-income countries largely bearing the brunt of it, provides fertile ground for the virus to mutate, he added.Also Read | Centre says coronavirus case trajectory in eight states concerningMadhi opined that since no country will lock its border perpetually, the entire global population will need to reach a similar immunity threshold about the same time. He suggested that the world should rather be heading the way the UK has moved - high vaccination rates and getting back to a relatively normal lifestyle.“The UK experience is where we should be heading. That is getting back to a relatively normal lifestyle, provided that we’ve got a adequate number of people vaccinated, and particularly people who are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19,” he wrote.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has long back ruled out herd immunity strategy as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic, calling it scientifically and ethically problematic. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had stressed that herd immunity has never in the history of public health been used as a strategy for responding to a virus outbreak.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/herd-immunity-unlikely-in-our-lifetimes-should-be-heading-uk-s-way-expert-101628070810303.html

It has also made children as young as 12 eligible for inoculation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-reimposes-more-curbs-as-amid-covid-19-surge-101628066385354.html

The company has a controversial policy against fact-checking political ads, which led to criticism that candidates would pay the company to spread lies through their ads. Facebook eventually halted all new political ads in the week leading up to the 2020 US election in an effort to fight misinformation.Last October, Facebook sent the researchers a cease-and-desist letter demanding they stop collecting targeting data about Facebook political ads, and threatening “additional enforcement action.” Laura Edelson, a researcher at NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering, told the Wall Street Journal at the time that the group would stop if Facebook published the more nuanced data itself.Clark said Facebook offers targeting data sets for political ads, and has suggested the NYU group use that information. According to Facebook’s terms of service, a user may not “access or collect data from our products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data you do not have permission to access.”Facebook moved to penalize the researchers in part to remain in compliance with a 2019 data privacy agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, in which the company was punished for failing to police how data was collected by outside developers, Clark said. Facebook was fined a record $5 billion as part of a settlement with regulators.Edelson, a PhD candidate in computer science and the lead researcher behind the group, confirmed that her personal Facebook account and those of some of her colleagues were disabled Tuesday night. By cutting the group’s access to Facebook’s data stream, the company is essentially ending NYU’s effort to study misinformation in political ads, she added.“Facebook is silencing us because our work often calls attention to problems on its platform,” Edelson wrote in an emailed statement. “Worst of all, Facebook is using user privacy, a core belief that we have always put first in our work, as a pretext for doing this. If this episode demonstrates anything it’ is that Facebook should not have veto power over who is allowed to study them.”The NYU-led research project started before the 2020 US election to better study the thousands of political ads on the social network. Political ads on Facebook are public in a searchable database, including some demographic data about the gender and location of people who saw the ad. But the database doesn’t include details about how an ad was targeted, part of the information the Ad Observatory was trying to collect.Facebook’s political ad library is “is complicated to use, untold numbers of political ads are missing, and a significant element is lacking: how advertisers choose which specific demographics and groups of people should see their ad -- and who shouldn’t,” the Ad Observatory researchers said on their website.For instance, the Ad Observatory revealed that Jon Ossoff, a Georgia Democrat, targeted Facebook users who were interested in topics such as former president Barack Obama, comedian Trevor Noah and Time magazine during his campaign for US Senate. His opponent, former Republican Senator David Perdue, targeted users who liked Sean Hannity’s show on Fox News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-disables-accounts-tied-to-nyu-research-project-sparks-outrage-101628065367540.html
04-08-2021||World||Pakistan's Imran Khan under fire over 'failure' to exit FATF grey list||Pakistan opposition slammed the federal government of Imran Khan over its failure to remove the country from Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) grey list.Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) MNA and former prime minister Raja Pervez Ashraf asked the federal government to tell the National Assembly about the only condition which Pakistan had not so far fulfilled to come out of the FATF grey list, reported Dawn.Responding to the question Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Muhammad Khan on Monday said that the only point left for implementation was regarding the prosecution of some people.He said the country had not been able to come out of the FATF grey list because of political reasons and not on technical grounds, adding that when Prime Minister Imran Khan had taken a bold stance of saying "no" then "the nation will have to definitely pay the price [for it]".The question about FATF conditions had originally been asked by PPP's Shamim Ara Panhwar and it was deferred by the speaker during the assembly session in May.In a written reply to the question, Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin told the assembly that the FATF had reviewed Pakistan's progress on the FATF action plan in its plenary meeting held on February 25.He said Pakistan had undertaken enormous work to strengthen its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) regime and address the strategic counterterrorism financing-related deficiencies, reported Dawn."This work has been acknowledged by the FATF in its plenary statement by taking note of the significant progress made on the entire action plan and by largely addressing 24 out of the 27 action items in the action plan," the minister said, adding: "As of now, all the 10 action items pertaining to the financial sector and border controls have been addressed."In relation to terrorism financing investigations and prosecutions, he said six of the eight action items had been addressed, whereas, for targeted financial sanctions, eight of the nine action items also stood addressed, reported Dawn."Pakistan has also made notable progress in the remaining three action items which also stand partially addressed. The progress on the remaining three action items is well underway with significant progress made so far and it is expected that Pakistan would complete the remaining action plan items by FATF plenary of June 2021 and would become eligible to exit from the grey list in accordance with FATF International Cooperation Review Group (ICRG) procedures," the minister stated in his reply which had been submitted to the National Assembly Secretariat before the June 21 FATF plenary.Pakistan, however, had been retained in the grey list while failing to complete one action plan point.Pakistan was retained on the FATF's 'grey list' for failing to effectively implement the global FATF standards and over its lack of progress on investigation and prosecution of senior leaders and commanders of UN-designated terror groups.Announcing the decision at a virtual press conference five-day plenary meeting, FATF President Dr Marcus Pleyer had said Pakistan will remain on the grey list till it addresses all items on the original action plan agreed to in June 2018 as well as all items on a parallel action plan handed out by the watchdog's regional partner - the Asia Pacific Group (APG) - in 2019.Pakistan has been on the FATF's grey list for deficiencies in its counter-terror financing and anti-money laundering regimes since June 2018.Pakistan is facing the difficult task of getting its name off from the FATF grey list. As things stand, Islamabad is finding it difficult to shield terror perpetrators and implement the FATF action plan at the same time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistans-imran-khan-under-fire-over-failure-to-exit-fatf-grey-list-101628058097886.html
04-08-2021||World||UNSC condemns Afghanistan violence, says it won’t support ‘Islamic emirate’||The UN Security Council on Tuesday condemned deliberate and targeted attacks on civilians in Afghanistan and declared that it does “not support the restoration of the Islamic emirate” as the pre-2001 Taliban regime used to call itself.In a statement issued on the second day of the Indian presidency, the UNSC slammed the attack on a UN compound in Herat last week. It said that “deliberate attacks targeting civilians, United Nations personnel and United Nations compounds may constitute war crimes”.All UNSC members are concerned about the escalating violence in Afghanistan, as the statement reflected. A request is understood to have been moved for a UNSC meeting on the situation in the country, which would signal heightened concerns in the top UN body.Calling for an immediate reduction in violence, the UNSC said “sustainable peace can be achieved only through a comprehensive and inclusive Afghan-led, Afghan-owned peace process that aims at a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire, as well as an inclusive, just and realistic political settlement to end the conflict in Afghanistan”.The UNSC members directed their attention to the Taliban’s plans to restore the “Islamic emirate”, as their regime was called before it was overthrown in October 2001 by a US-led invasion following the 9/11 terror attacks in the US.“The members of the Security Council recalled resolution 2513 (2020) reaffirmed that there is no military solution to the conflict, and declared that they do not support the restoration of the Islamic emirate,” the statement said.It was referring to a resolution adopted by the UNSC in March 2020 welcoming peace talks and efforts following the signing of the US-Taliban accord. It had said, among other things, that the “Islamic emirate of Afghanistan is not recognised at the United States, and furthermore that the UN Security Council does not support the restoration of the Islamic emirate of Afghanistan”.The Taliban has advanced aggressively in recent weeks as the pullout of US-led international forces nears completion much ahead of the September 11 deadline self-imposed by US President Joe Biden. Their military advance has been accompanied by the return of brutal and barbaric violence and practices that had marked their 1996-2001 reign.INDIA WATCHING CLOSELYIndia has followed the situation in Afghanistan closely and has called for a “permanent and comprehensive ceasefire”, which was reflected in Tuesday’s statement. Afghanistan will be a key issue that could dominate India’s term as the rotational president of the Security Council for the month of August.The UNSC statement called on the Islamic Republic - as Afghanistan is called - and the Taliban to “engage meaningfully in an inclusive, Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process in order to make urgent progress towards a political settlement and a ceasefire”. The Security Council also stressed on “the need for full, equal and meaningful participation of women”.The Afghan government and the Taliban are barely talking as the insurgents have been focused on expanding their areas of influence through military advances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unsc-condemns-afghanistan-violence-says-it-won-t-support-islamic-emirate-101628053298515.html

"Shame to its backer(s)," Saleh had said in the tweet posted hours before he took part in the protest.For six year, Saleh was a key figure in the anti-Taliban fight as head of the National Directorate for Security (NDS). He became Afghanistan's vice president in 2020. An ethnic Tajik, Saleh was a prominent member of the movement which fought the Taliban during the 1990s.In July, Saleh had said that the diplomatic community of Pakistan is working hard to painting and decorating a fictional image for the Taliban. "On the ground, however, Talibs 2.0 is nothing but an Afghanistan replica of IS-K and Al-Qadea, providing bases to foreign "good and bad terrorists" The "good" LeT is their buddies in allegiance," Saleh had said in a tweet.Last week, residents in the western province of Herat braved the streets despite nearby fighting to protest against the Taliban. Other cities quickly organised to join from their homes in the evenings, as a message of support for security forces who are fighting the insurgent group.A car bomb blast followed by sporadic gunfire hit Afghanistan's capital Kabul on Tuesday near the heavily fortified "Green Zone", leaving three civilians and three attackers dead, security officials said amid an upturn in violence by Taliban militants.At least seven other people were wounded, said health ministry spokesperson Ghulam Dastagir Nazari.

In a resolution passed on Tuesday, the council also called the July 30 attack on UN compound in Herat "deplorable".An Afghan security forces guard was killed and several others were injured in the attack.The press statement was agreed by all 15 members of the UNSC. The UN's most powerful body called on the Afghan government and the Taliban "to engage meaningfully in an inclusive, Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process in order to make urgent progress towards a political settlement and a ceasefire"."The members of the Security Council recognized that a sustainable peace can be achieved only through a comprehensive and inclusive Afghan-led, Afghan-owned peace process that aims at a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire, as well as an inclusive, just, and realistic political settlement to end the conflict in Afghanistan," according to the statement.The members reaffirmed that there is no military solution to the conflict, and declared that they do not support the restoration of the Islamic Emirate.The council's statement came a day after a powerful blast hit Afghanistan’s capital Kabul on Tuesday near the city’s heavily fortified Green Zone, an area home to government buildings and foreign embassies.At least three people were killed and seven wounded in the attack and sporadic gunfire that followed, the country's health ministry said.A senior security official said the blast appeared to have been caused by a car bomb and the apparent target was the residence of a member of parliament.The council is expected to hold an open meeting Friday on the worsening security situation in Afghanistan, news agency Associated Press reported quoting diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity.The war between the Taliban and Afghanistan's government forces has intensified over the past few months as US and NATO troops complete their pullout from the war-torn country.

04-08-2021||World||Pakistan to rent out PM’s official house to manage 'financial crunch': Report||Reeling from a financial crunch, Pakistan has now put its prime minister Imran Khan's official residence in Islamabad on the market for rent, according to a report by news agency ANI citing the local media. Earlier, the ruling Tehreek-Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government led by Khan had announced its plans to convert the prime minister's residence into a university. However, that plan has now reportedly been dropped, with the federal government instead deciding to rent out the property. Imran Khan had vacated his official residence in Islamabad after the Pakistan government announced in August 2019 its plan to convert the prime minister's house into a state-of-the-art federal educational institution. According to a report by Samaa TV, the federal government has decided to rent out the property to people who want to hold cultural, fashion, educational, and other events at the premises located at the Red Zone in Islamabad."Two committees have been formed for this purpose. They will be responsible for ensuring the discipline and decorum of the PM House are not violated during the events," Saama TV said.According to local media, the federal cabinet will meet and discuss ways to garner revenue from the PM House building.The auditorium of the prime minister's house, two guest wings, and a lawn will probably be rented out to generate funds. High-level diplomatic functions and international seminars will also be held at the former principal workplace of the Pakistani premier.Imran Khan, after taking over as Pakistan's prime minister, had announced that the federal government doesn't have the money to spend on public welfare schemes, while a few people in the country are "living like our colonial masters used to live". He has since then been living at his Bani Gala residence and only uses the prime minister's office.Pakistan's economy has shrunk by USD 19 billion in the last three years since Khan came to the power. When he became the prime minister, he took many austere steps to cut down government expenses to give respite to the country's economy.Earlier, former finance minister Miftah Ismail remarked that the Imran Khan-led regime was "toying with the economy", adding that it had increased the loans of the government and state institutions by ₹45,000 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-rent-out-pm-s-official-house-to-manage-financial-crunch-report-101628040583051.html

04-08-2021||World||Number Theory: A story of two worlds hit differently by the Delta variant of Covid||New infections of Covid-19 have once again started surging across the world, with several countries reporting a record number of new infections. Experts have blamed the latest surge on the global spread of the Delta variant, a highly contagious variant of Sars-CoV-2. The Delta variant, which was first identified in India late last year, is expected to become the dominant strain of the virus over the coming months, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).As of August 1, the variant had spread to 132 countries and territories, and caused a massive rise in infections in many of these nations.But despite the rapid rise of new infections in these countries, their experiences in dealing with the outbreak is turning out entirely different due to just one factor — vaccination. While the West, which has managed to cover large swathes of its population, has managed to keep its deaths far lower than in previous waves, nations in Asia and Africa are struggling. Here’s a look at how the “Delta waves” are charting different statistics in the rich first world and the not-so-rich developing world.1. Delta variant pushes new infections globally againFor the week ending June 21, the seven-day average of new cases across the world dropped to 359,095 a day – the lowest this figure had touched since February. Through most of June, with the exception of a handful of countries, new cases were dropping almost everywhere in the world’s major hot-spot nations, which was a good sign even as countries, especially in the West, rushed to cover as many people as possible with vaccines. But the “Delta wave” has since emerged. In the past week, more than 600,000 new cases were reported across the world every day, according to global case data maintained by Our World In Data. This is the highest daily case rate seen in at least two months; worryingly, the number is continuing to rise.2. Cases rise in the vaccinated West, but deaths remain lowThe case trajectories (seven-day average of new infections) of five Western nations – the United States, the United Kingdom, Portugal, France and Spain – where the Delta variant has been wreaking havoc show an alarming spike over the past few weeks.All have completely vaccinated large proportions of their populations and feature among the countries with highest vaccine coverage in the world. Spain has fully vaccinated 57.6% of its residents, while the UK has done so for 56.5% of its population. In Portugal, 55.7% of the country is fully vaccinated while this number is 50.2% in the US and 47.1% in France.While the highly infectious variant caused a spike in cases in these nations, deaths have remained low. In Spain, while there were 22,990 new cases every day in the past week, there were only 54 deaths a day on average. This translates to only 0.2% of infections in the past week resulting in deaths. The same proportion of cases have resulted in deaths in France as well, while deaths in the past week touched 0.3% of cases in the UK, 0.4% in Portugal and 0.5% in the US. The charts here show how the latest outbreaks in these countries are nowhere as fatal as previous waves – a clear result of the protection offered by vaccination.3. Developing and unvaccinated world sees deaths soarThe story that is playing out in Asia and Africa, however, is very different. Asia, in particular, has borne the biggest brunt of the Delta variant.For residents of these nations, access to vaccines has not been as easy as it has been in the West. For reasons ranging from supply issues to affordability to inability of their governments to cover their populations quickly with shots, the countries listed here have all managed to completely vaccinate only tiny proportions of their populations. For instance, Bangladesh has fully vaccinated just 2.6% of its residents, while Iran has managed to cover 2.9% of its citizens. In Thailand, just 5.2% of the nation’s population is completely vaccinated, while this number is 7.6% in Indonesia and 8.2% in Tunisia.While India’s second wave may have been brought under control for now, in the past few weeks, nations such as Indonesia and Thailand have become two of the world’s biggest outbreak centres with the spread of the Delta variant. But the biggest concern for these nations is not the rate at which cases have soared, but of rising deaths.Fatalities in these regions have soared to record highs, and continue to rise at an alarming rate. With the exception of Iran, average daily deaths in these countries are currently at record highs. Even in the case of Iran, it appears that the death trajectory will scale the previous record in a few days, unless the trend reverses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/number-theory-a-story-of-two-worlds-hit-differently-by-the-delta-variant-of-covid-101628032013214.html

They are arresting or shooting people who have smartphones," a resident of Lashkar Gah told AFP, on condition of anonymity.The loss of Lashkar Gah would be a massive strategic and psychological blow for the government, which has pledged to defend cities at all costs after losing much of the rural countryside to the Taliban over the summer.In the western city of Herat that is also under siege, officials said government forces had managed to push back the insurgents from several areas -- including near the airport, which is vital for supplies.But on Tuesday afternoon, four rockets struck the airport. The facility was not damaged, airport chief Shaheer Salehi told AFP, but two flights were cancelled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/attack-targeting-afghanistan-s-defence-minister-ends-with-all-attackers-killed-ministry-101628022304940.html

The cities of Nanjing and Yangzhou in Jiangsu province in eastern China have cancelled all domestic flights, and Beijing has halted long-distance trains from 23 stations in the affected regions.Led by the national health commission, China has stepped up efforts to contain a new cluster of Covid-19 infections - the biggest in China since last year.In a related development, Zhangjiajie in Hunan province has ordered all residents and tourists not to leave the city to control a cluster outbreak of the Delta variant of Covid-19.NYC will require jab proof for indoor dining, gymsNew York City will soon require proof of Covid-19 vaccinations for anyone who wants to dine indoors at a restaurant, see a performance or go to the gym, mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Tuesday, making it the first big city in the US to impose such restrictions.Greece and Sweden plan booster shotsA large part of Sweden’s population is likely to be offered a top-up dose of a Covid-19 vaccine next year, according to the public health agency. Greece is also ready to start administering third doses for vulnerable groups.On the vaccination front, half of the population of the EU has been fully vaccinated, according to an AFP tally on Tuesday.In the US, 70% of adults have received at least one dose, a key milestone in the fight against the pandemic that the country hit nearly a month later than President Joe Biden had hoped.US Senator Lindsey Graham, meanwhile, said he has tested positive for Covid-19 despite being vaccinated, becoming at least the third member of Congress to recently report a coronavirus infection.Israel said on Tuesday it will require all persons arriving from the United States and 17 other countries to quarantine starting next week as the country grapples with a surge in coronavirus infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/its-deja-vu-in-china-s-wuhan-as-mass-testing-for-covid-19-returns-101628002831593.html
04-08-2021||World||Chinese government confirms Indian student was murdered, 1 held||The Chinese police have taken into custody a foreign student at Tianjin Foreign Studies University (TFSU) in connection with the murder of a 20-year-old Indian, a student at the same varsity, last week, people familiar with the development said.Aman Nagsen, a resident of Gaya in Bihar, was a student of international business studies at the university located in the city of Tianjin, around 100km south of Beijing. He was found dead on the campus on July 29.Preliminary examination of the body and the crime scene by Tianjin police confirmed that Nagsen was murdered, the Chinese foreign ministry told HT in a statement.“Around 8pm on the night of July 29, Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau (PSB) received a call saying that an Indian student was lying on the floor of the dormitory with no sign of life,” the statement said.“The initial investigation of the Public Security organ found the case to be homicide, and the suspect is another foreign student at the university. Compulsory measures have been taken on the suspect and the case is still under further investigation,” the statement added.HT has separately learnt that Nagsen was stabbed to death with a sharp-edged weapon.Neither the nationality of the suspect nor the motive behind the murder — what seems like a rare serious crime on a Chinese campus involving two foreigners — could be immediately confirmed. It also could not be known if the murder weapon was recovered by the investigators.The Chinese foreign ministry said it was in communication with the Indian embassy in Beijing on the case. The Indian embassy was informed about the case first on July 30 and then again on the following day, it added. “Relevant Chinese competent authorities had notified the Indian embassy in Beijing of the situation of the case on July 30 and 31, respectively, and maintained communication with the embassy,” the statement said.“The Chinese side will handle the case in accordance with law and offer active assistance in follow-up matters,” it added.Meanwhile, Nagsen’s grieving family in Gaya continued its appeal to authorities in India and China for help in getting the body back.“Let them continue with the investigation after sending the remains home. We beg the Chinese and Indian authorities,” the deceased’s uncle Pankaj Paswan said from Gaya.An official from the Indian embassy is said to have gone to Tianjin to coordinate the release of the body with local Chinese authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/foreign-student-in-custody-for-murdering-indian-student-at-university-in-china-101627995091386.html
04-08-2021||World||Chinese channel airs footage of Galwan Valley clash to mark PLA Day||China’s official English television channel, CGTN, has uploaded a video on one of the four People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers who died fighting Indian troops in Galwan Valley in June 2020 on social media and its website to mark the armed forces’ founding day on August 1.The focus of the video is Chen Hongjun, one of the four PLA troops killed in the brutal fight with Indian border personnel on the night of June 15, 2020.Besides interviews of Chen’s family members, including his wife, the video shows edited footage of the clash between the two armies, Chinese equipment on the banks of the fast flowing river, soldiers, mostly Chinese, wading in knee-deep water, and personnel from the two sides charging at each other.“To mark PLA Day, also known as Army Day, CGTN’s special series brings you Chen’s story,” the CGTN video said.The video, evidently pitched as a propaganda piece aimed at a domestic Chinese audience, begins with a one-sided introduction to the Galwan Valley clash. “Indian army violated the bilateral consensus and crossed the Line of Actual Control on June 15, 2020,” it says - a claim repeatedly dismissed by India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-tv-channel-uploads-footage-of-galwan-valley-clash-to-mark-army-day-101627988551003.html
