Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters Friday that the United States is monitoring the threats “virtually, in real-time.”“We still believe there are credible threats. In fact, I'd say specific, credible threats, and we want to make sure we're prepared for those,” Kirby said.“We have additional information...what you're seeing us act on, to the degree we can talk about, it is based on information that we have, and I think, I think I’d like it at that,” he added.The attack outside the Kabul airport took place even as the United States was aware of the threats from the Islamic State terrorists. When asked about whether another such attack is potentially imminent, the Pentagon spokesperson said, “We certainly are prepared and would expect future attempts, absolutely, but I won't get into the specifics of what those are and why we're doing what we're doing.”Also Read | A day after confirming, US says no second explosion near Kabul's Baron HotelWithout elaborating on the nature of the threat, Kirby stressed that they are “monitoring these threats, very, very specifically, virtually in real-time.”Several countries have decided to wind up the evacuation operations in Afghanistan in the wake of heightened security concerns but the US has insisted on continuing the mission till the August 31 deadline. US Army Major General William Taylor asserted that the Islamic State terrorists won’t deter the US troops from accomplishing the mission.“There are more than 5,000 US service members in harm’s way saving as many people as they can.

Might have done 'naively', claims report||A recent report by US-based Politico has revealed that US officials in Kabul gave the Taliban a list of names of American citizens, green card holders and Afghan allies in the country so that they can be easily evacuated. But after the blasts near the Kabul airport that have killed over 100 people, the naive list of names is being interpreted as 'kill list', as the Taliban are known to be vindictive against Afghans who help the United States. "Basically, they just pull all those Afghans on a kill list," a defence official told Politico on the condition of anonymity.US President Joe Biden on Thursday did not deny any such list and said there may have been a list of names of vulnerable Afghans. "There have been occasions when our military has contacted their military counterparts in the Taliban and said this, for example, this bus is coming through with X number of people on it, made up of the following group of people. We want you to let that bus or that group through," he said. "So, yes there have been occasions like that. To the best of my knowledge, in those cases, the bulk of that has occurred and they have been let through.Joe Biden to Kabul attackers: 'We will hunt you down and make you pay'The Biden administration was relying on the Taliban for security outside the airport, though the Taliban said that the blasts took place in the area managed by US forces. The ISIS-Khorasan has claimed the responsibility for the deadly attack and said their target was US forces.The Politico report said the list issue came up during a classified briefing on Capitol Hill this week and top Biden administration officials defended that close coordination with the Taliban was the best way to keep Americans and Afghans safe. “They had to do that because of the security situation the White House created by allowing the Taliban to control everything outside the airport,” one US official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/did-us-officials-give-taliban-a-kill-list-might-have-done-naively-claims-report-101630080767086.html

27-08-2021||World||Taliban-Haqqani-Al Qaeda: What experts think is happening in Afghanistan||The blasts near Kabul airport on Thursday which the Taliban have officially condemned is a major jolt to both the United States and the Taliban, experts have said. The attack by the ISIS-Khorasan province puts the Taliban under pressure to secure Kabul, analysts interviewed by news agency AFP said. At the same time, the attack puts the Taliban-Haqqani-Al Qaeda triumvirate under the scanner, analysts told New York Times. ISIS-K’s links with the Taliban through Haqqani has also been suggested by some experts.Afghanistan's former vice president Amrullah Saleh alleged that the IS-K have their roots in Talibs and Haqqani network, particularly the ones operating in Kabul; though ISIS-K and the Taliban are rivals."Last night's attacks have shown once again that no one group can claim monopoly over violence in Afghanistan or claim to secure it," said Abdul Basit, a researcher of international studies told AFP.The Taliban have claimed to be aware of such imminent threats but the back-to-back blasts at crowded airport areas proved that their security failed, in case they intended to provide security to Afghan people, as promised earlier. "Taliban checkpoints that dot around the city failed to catch the perpetrators of the Kabul airport attack. But that's based on the assumption the Taliban intended to provide security in the first place to protect lives," Nishank Motwani, an Afghan analyst told AFP.A New York Times analysis says that a strike of this magnitude would bolster ISIS-K’s stature in the jihadist world as this branch of the Islamic State is not a major force, neither in Afghanistan, not in the world. The group’s ranks have dropped to about 1,500 to 2,000 fighters, about half from its peak levels in 2016, the NYT report said.“The Taliban, Haqqani network, and Al Qaeda function as a triumvirate, and one that is very much part of the same militant network, they work together hand-in-glove,” Colin P. Clarke, a counterterrorism analyst told NYT adding that they have actually grown closer over the past decade. And the closeness will only increase after the US withdrawal, the analyst said.An Afghanistan specialist at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, Seth G Jones told NYT that ISIS-K is not a first-tier ISIS affiliate but with the Afghan commandoes and the American military gone, they might get a breathing room.ISIS leader Shahab al-Muhajir is reported to have been a former mid-level Haqqani commander before defecting. Many ISIS commanders and fighters were once part of Al Qaeda or an Al Qaeda franchise and hence experts are not ruling out the IS-Haqqani-Taliban link.(With inputs from AFP and New York Times)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/talibanhaqqanial-qaeda-what-experts-think-is-happening-in-afghanistan-101630074869001.html

The body of a male cub was found on Thursday about 5 meters (15 feet) away, he said.An examination determined they died from infected wounds caused by traps, Arianto said.He said several traps similar to ones used to capture wild pigs on farms were found in the area of the bodies.“Setting traps for pigs in a conservation area is very unlikely,” Arianto said, “This was intended to poach endangered animals for economic gain." He said his agency will cooperate with law enforcement agencies in an investigation.Sumatran tigers, the most critically endangered tiger subspecies, are under increasing pressure due to poaching as their jungle habitat shrinks, according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It estimated fewer than 400 Sumatran tigers remain in the wild.It was the latest in a series of killings of endangered animals on Sumatra island. Conservationists have warned that the coronavirus pandemic has led to increased poaching as villagers turn to hunting for economic reasons.Early last month, a female tiger was found dead with injuries caused by a snare trap in South Aceh district.An elephant was found without a head on July 11 at a palm plantation in East Aceh. Police arrested an alleged poacher along with four people accused of buying ivory taken from the dead animal.Aceh police also arrested four men in June for allegedly poaching a tiger with a snare trap and selling its remains for 100 million rupiah ($6,900). Days later, another Sumatran tiger died after it ate a goat laced with rat poison in neighboring North Sumatra province.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-endangered-sumatran-tigers-found-dead-in-indonesia-101630063112450.html

The US has said that it would pull all its troops out of the country by August 31, before which the evacuations have been continuing frantically. Meanwhile, two explosions rocked the Kabul airport earlier on Thursday in which several civilians along with US armed personnel were killed.Also read | Taliban return but war isn’t over. Know the groups vying to take control of AfghanistanDue to the security concerns in the Kabul international airport, Brennan said that it would not be suitable for the supply of aid in Afghanistan. “Right now because of security concerns and several other operational considerations, Kabul airport is not going to be an option for the next week at least,” news agency Reuters quoted him as saying during a press briefing.Further, he also said that the WHO is working with the Pakistani authorities to establish an air bridge into Afghanistan. “One of the problems we have in Afghanistan right now is there is no civil aviation authority functioning but we are working with Pakistan particularly in the context of Mazar-i-Sharif airport. Because they can work with contacts on the ground that all the necessary steps to land an aircraft, to land a cargo aircraft, can be put in place,” he added.Mentioning that insurance prices for flying into Afghanistan have “skyrocketed to prices never seen before,” Brennan said, “So we are trying to jump through that hoop at the moment and once we have addressed that we will hopefully be airborne in the next 48 to 72 hours.”(With Reuters inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-says-medical-supplies-to-run-out-within-days-in-afghanistan-hopes-to-establish-air-bridge-soon-101630063161588.html

Afghanistan former vice president Amrullah Saleh said the IS-K has its roots in Talibs and Haqqani network, particularly the ones operating in Kabul. US President Joe Biden, on the other hand, said he has not found any evidence that the Taliban colluded with the IS terrorists in carrying out the attacks.Amid this debate, the role of Khalil Haqqani, who is in charge of the security of Kabul has come under the scanner.

Khalil Haqqani has had a $5 million reward after the US designated him a terrorist 10 years ago.Kabul blast: What Amrullah Saleh says on Taliban, ISIS-K, Haqqani link2. Khalil Haqqani is a Haqqani group leader. After the fall of Kabul on August 15, he was seen roaming the streets of Kabul.3. On one hand, Khalil has Taliban support and on the other, he had "acted on behalf of al-Qaeda and their terrorist operations".4.

Since then, it has administered another billion shots in the last 10 weeks.More than 889.4 million people have been fully vaccinated in China, the NHC spokesperson, Mi Feng said.Continuous efforts will be made to advance the mass vaccination campaign, Mi said on Friday, warning against any slackness among the public in personal protection.Speaking at a health conference recently, China’s top respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan had said that the country is aiming to fully vaccinate 80% of its 1.4 billion population by the end of 2021.China’s push to boost vaccination rates accelerated since July when the highly contagious Delta variant triggered the worst country-wide outbreak since last year.The outbreak is now under control but authorities have kept up the pace of the country’s vaccine campaign.The respiratory expert Zhong said achieving herd immunity depends on vaccine efficacy and virus transmissibility. “The efficacy of China-developed vaccines is about 70%, so the country would need more than 80% of the population to be vaccinated before establishing herd immunity,” Zhong was quoted as saying by Chinese state media.Zhong added China is expected to reach that goal by the end of 2021.According to experts, herd immunity occurs when a large portion of a population becomes immune to a spreading infection or disease, preventing transmission within communities.Chinese President Xi Jinping has also said the country will strive to provide 2 billion vaccine doses to the world throughout this year and offer $100 million to Covax.Speaking at the NHC press conference in Beijing on Friday, Zheng Zhongwei, an NHC official said that experts in China have recommended making booster Covid-19 doses available to specific groups, such as employees at higher risk of exposure to the virus and those who have weak immunity or are aged above 60.These people who work in the aviation industry, customs, borders, quarantine sites and specific medical institutions, as well as those who travel abroad to places where the virus is still spreading, should get a booster shot six months after completing their regular vaccination regimens, Zheng was quoted as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-889-4mn-fully-jabbed-against-covid-in-china-101630061728626.html

Medical examiners ruled his death as suicide. The guards who were deployed to check Epstein’s cell were accused of napping and surfing the internet rather than checking on the convict, the report added.Issuing a statement, the Justice Department said on Thursday that the MCC will be closed at least temporarily in order to resolve issues related to safety and infrastructure. “In an effort to address the issues at MCC NY as quickly and efficiently as possible, the Department has decided to close the MCC, at least temporarily, until those issues have been resolved,” the Justice Department said.

Know the groups vying to take control of Afghanistan||The Taliban ousted the Ashraf Ghani-led government in Afghanistan and took over the effective control of the war-torn country after capturing Kabul earlier this month. The return of the insurgents to power after two decades has thrown left Afghanistan with an uncertain future while the latest suicide bombings outside Kabul airport by the Islamic State has compounded the problems for Afghans as well as the international community.Afghan and US officials had earlier said that at least 60 civilians and 13 US Marines were killed in these attacks. A report by Associated Press suggests that the death toll of Afghans in the suicide bombings is at least 95. The growing threat from the Afghanistan affiliate of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) forced many countries to abruptly end their evacuation operations.As the deadline for a complete withdrawal of US-led foreign troops approaches, Afghanistan’s political crisis could even worsen given several groups vying for power.Here are the groups trying to take control of Afghanistan:The Taliban: The group was founded by Mullah Mohammad Omar in 1994 and originally drew members from the so-called “mujahideen” fighters who fought against the erstwhile Soviet forces in the 1980s. The Taliban ruled Afghanistan from 1996-2001 before US forces invaded the country in what they called the fight against terrorism. The fighters regrouped over the past two decades and signed a deal with the United States that led to the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghan soil. The insurgents want to reestablish their regime.The Northern Alliance: The Panjshir Valley was free from Taliban rule during 1996-2001 and continues to stand strong against the Islamist fundamentalists. An alliance of Uzbek and ethnic Tajik forces, led by Ahmad Massoud, has vowed to continue fighting the Taliban. Amrullah Saleh, the first vice president of the ousted Afghan government, has backed the alliance in their fight against the Taliban.Also Read | Taliban ask Afghan imams to preach about obedience at Friday prayersISIS-K: The terrorist organisation is also made of hardline Sunni Islamist militants like the Taliban but the two groups are sworn enemies. ISIS-Khorasan, which pledged allegiance to slain Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2015, has been involved in some of the deadliest terror attacks in recent years. The leaders of ISIS-K rejected the deal between the Taliban and the US that has led to the withdrawal of foreign troops. According to a UN report, the strength of ISIS-K could be anywhere between 500 to 10,000.Al Qaeda: While the Taliban had pledged to prevent al Qaeda and other terrorist organisations from using Afghan soil in a peace deal signed with the United States, a UN report suggests the ties between the insurgents, especially its Haqqani network branch, and al Qaeda remain close.

The Taliban in its statement blamed the United States for the attack and said that the attack took place because of the presence of foreign troops in the airport.Commenting on the blast and how the Taliban washed their hands off the massacre that took the lives of around 100 people, Afghanistan's self-proclaimed president Amrullah Saleh said that the Taliban have learnt it from their master Pakistan to deny their links with ISIS. There is every evidence to show that Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-K) has links with the Taliban and the Haqqani network.Every evidence we have in hand shows that IS-K cells have their roots in Talibs & Haqqani network particularly the ones operating in Kabul.

"We will not leave anyone behind."It was not immediately clear whether the vaccination campaign would extend to Rohingya Muslims living in densely-packed camps in Rakhine state and what the qualification criteria would be.The issue is deeply sensitive in Myanmar, where animosity about Rohingya runs deep. International rights groups say hundreds of thousands of stateless Rohingya should be entitled to citizenship rather than be discriminated against and branded illegal immigrants.A junta-appointed administrator earlier this month said there was no plan to include Rohingya in camps near the state capital Sittwe.At least 700,000 Rohingya fled Rakhine for Bangladesh in 2017 during operations by the army under the command of Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who is now prime minister and head of Myanmar's junta.UN investigators said those operations were carried out with "genocidal intent" but the army denied that and said they were aimed at countering Rohingya "terrorists".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/theyre-also-our-people-myanmar-will-extend-covid-19-vaccinations-to-rohingya-101630054299018.html

27-08-2021||World||New Zealand extends Covid lockdown till Aug 31; ‘Delta more infectious’, says PM||New Zealand on Friday extended its national lockdown for four more days amid the surging cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and warned that restrictions might last longer in Auckland, which is now the country’s virus epicentre. The lockdown was first imposed on August 17 and was supposed to end on Friday. According to news agency AFP, the Delta variant of the coronavirus emerged in Auckland the previous week, which ended a six-month period without any local transmission that made New Zealand one of the very few Covid-free zones across the globe.After holding a cabinet meeting in Wellington on Friday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that the Level 4 lockdown will remain in place till August 31 midnight. “We may be seeing the beginning of a plateau in cases,” Ardern said. “Our job is to keep up the hard work in order to bend and then flatten that curve. We have evidence that what we are doing is working, but caution is still required,” she added.In Auckland, this lockdown is likely to remain imposed for another two weeks while the rest of the regions in the South Pacific nation can descend to Level 3 lockdown. Under the third level, some businesses, including restaurants and retail outlets are allowed to reopen by using contactless collection methods. The government has still advised people to stay at home and work from home under this level. Gatherings are only restricted to 10 people while shops, daycare centres, schools and public venues are closed.On Friday, New Zealand reported 70 new community cases, which took the total infections amid the outbreak of the Delta variant to 347. While on Tuesday, the country recorded its highest single-day spike since April when 41 people were detected as Covid-19 positive. Prime Minister Ardern also pointed out on Friday that “Delta is definitely more infectious, and it moves more quickly,” adding that Level 4 lockdown is the most effective tool at the present moment.Arden has gained global recognition for reducing the spread of Covid-19 in New Zealand. But Reuters reported on Tuesday that questions have been raised regarding her reliance on stringent border controls and snap lockdowns, which have impacted the economy.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-extends-covid-lockdown-till-aug-31-delta-more-infectious-says-pm-101630042013264.html

These heinous attacks took the lives of many innocent people desperately seeking to leave the country and those supporting evacuation efforts, including US service members and medical personnel. As one of its closest allies, Canada joins with the United States as they mourn their fallen.”The Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISIS-K), which is an Afghanistan-based affiliate of the West Asian terror entity Islamic State, has reportedly claimed responsibility for the twin blasts and gunfire in the Kabul airport area. Afghan civilians seeking to flee the country and foreign troops stationed were among those who were killed. The attacks took place at Kabul airport’s Abbey Gate and the nearby Baron Hotel.Offering the Canadian government’s condolences to the families and loved ones of the victims and wishing full recovery to the injured, Trudeau said, “Our thoughts are with the people of Afghanistan, and everyone affected by these senseless acts of violence.”“As the situation on the ground continues to evolve, we will keep working with our international and local partners to support humanitarian efforts, fight terrorism, and ensure those who want to leave Afghanistan can do so safely,” he added.Trudeau said that “all Afghan people deserve to live in dignity, peace, and security. Canada expects any future government of Afghanistan to fulfill its obligations to uphold the human rights of all its citizens, as required by international law”.The Canadian armed forces have said all their personnel stationed in Kabul were “safe and accounted for”, adding that the situation on the ground remains dangerous.The attacks came shortly after an announcement from the Canadian government that it had wrapped up its evacuation mission and only a small contingent of military personnel remained in Kabul to support the airlift operations of allies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-canadian-pm-condemns-kabul-terror-attacks-calls-them-heinous-101630045767830.html
27-08-2021||World||A year on, half of Wuhan’s hospitalised Covid patients have health issues: Study||Around half of the patients hospitalised with Covid-19 in the Chinese city of Wuhan in 2020 had health problems including muscle fatigue, shortness of breath and depression 12 months after their discharge, a year-long study has found.Overall, their health was weaker a year after recovery compared to those who were not infected with the virus, a study published in the medical journal Lancet said on Friday.The study conducted on recovered patients highlights the lingering impact of Covid-19 in some patients, sometimes lasting for months, though most recover fully.The study done by Chinese scientists from Beijing and Wuhan assessed health outcomes at six and 12 months for 1,276 Covid-19 patients treated at Jin Yin-Tan hospital in Wuhan between January and May 2020.The Covid-19 pandemic has so far claimed over 4.47 million lives around the world and infected more than 214 million people, according to the widely followed coronavirus tracker maintained by the US-based Johns Hopkins University. “Though most symptoms had resolved by 12 months, around one half of survivors still experienced at least one ongoing symptom (most commonly fatigue or muscle weakness), and one in three patients still experienced shortness of breath,” the study said.Around one in three people experienced shortness of breath while “lung impairments” persisted in some patients, especially those who had experienced the most severe illness with Covid-19.“Fatigue or muscle weakness was the most commonly reported symptom with around half of patients experiencing this at six months… Almost one third of patients reported experiencing shortness of breath at 12 months, which was more prevalent in patients who had been the most severely ill and had been on a ventilator during their time in hospital,” the study said.The study in Lancet also showed that the proportion of recovering patients reporting mental health issues was slightly higher at 12 months than at six, with 26% experiencing anxiety and depression.The Covid-19 virus first emerged in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, in late 2019 before spreading in and outside China, triggering the worst pandemic in a century.Bin Cao, a professor at National Centre for Respiratory Medicine at the China-Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing, said, “Our study is the largest to date to assess the health outcomes of hospitalised Covid-19 survivors after 12 months of becoming ill. While most had made a good recovery, health problems persisted in some patients, especially those who had been critically ill during their hospital stay.“Our findings suggest that recovery for some patients will take longer than one year, and this should be taken into account when planning delivery of healthcare services post-pandemic.”A Lancet editorial published with the study stressed on the need to understand and respond to the long-term impact of the disease.“Symptoms such as persistent fatigue, breathlessness, brain fog, and depression could debilitate many millions of people globally. Yet very little is known about the condition… With no proven treatments or even rehabilitation guidance, long Covid affects people’s ability to resume normal life and their capacity to work,” the editorial said.“The effect on society, from the increased healthcare burden and economic and productivity losses, is substantial. Long Covid is a modern medical challenge of the first order,” it added.What is worrying Xiaoying Gu, another author of the study from the same hospital as Bin quoted earlier, is the long-drawn psychological impact on patients.“We do not yet fully understand why psychiatric symptoms are slightly more common at one year than at six months in Covid-19 survivors. These could be caused by a biological process linked to the virus infection itself, or the body’s immune response to it. Or they could be linked to reduced social contact, loneliness, incomplete recovery of physical health or loss of employment associated with illness,” Xiaoying said.“Large, long-term studies of Covid-19 survivors are needed so that we can better understand the long term physical and mental health consequences of Covid-19,” Xiaoying added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-year-on-half-of-wuhan-s-hospitalised-covid-patients-have-health-issues-study-101630040907576.html

He insisted the ongoing evacuation process in Afghanistan will continue undeterred by the twin attacks.Biden’s warning carries weight as the US military has in the past taken out Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who had masterminded the September 11, 2001 terror attacks in America; Islamic State (IS) founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi; and Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, considered the fountainhead of terrorism in West Asia.“To those who carried out this attack, as well as anyone who wishes America harm, know this - we will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay. I will defend our interests and our people with every measure at my command,” Biden said in a speech from the White House.He added, “We have some reason to believe we know who they are - not certain - and we will find ways of our choosing, without large military operations, to get them.”The American president went on to strike a note of defiance. “We will not be deterred by terrorists. We will not let them stop our mission. We will continue the evacuation,” he said.Bien is facing continuing criticism at home and abroad for the abrupt withdrawal of US and US-led international forces from Afghanistan despite his and his aides’ attempts to blame the unfolding mess on his predecessor former US president Donald Trump and his 2020 deal with the Taliban.Biden has also faced pressure to extend the self-imposed deadline of August 31 for pulling out all American troops and personnel from Afghanistan. He has repeatedly pushed back against criticism, arguing that it’s time to end America’s longest war, and that the troop pull-out process would be messy irrespective of when it is eventually carried out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-will-hunt-you-down-joe-biden-tells-perpetrators-of-deadly-kabul-attacks-101630038447358.html

And yet again the links of all the principal terrorist organizations go back to Pakistan. At least 13 US service personnel including 12 Marines have been killed in the bombing with scores injured.While US President Joe Biden has promised to hunt the killers of Kabul airport bombings, the so-called ISKP has released the name and photo of one of the suicide bombers as Abdul Rahman Al Logari and claimed credit for breaching the airport perimeter security managed by the ruling Taliban and US forces. From the ISKP claim letter, the actual targets were US forces and their Afghan allies identified as spies, not the Taliban. The Kabul airport attack shows that Afghanistan will remain a swamp of terrorists and terrorism for time to come and even the keys to ISKP lie in Rawalpindi as revealed by Aslam Farooqui, the chief perpetrator of the March 27, 2020, Kabul Gurudwara attack.Also read | 'We will hunt you down': Biden to Kabul attackersOn April 4, 2020, the Afghan National Security Directorate (NDS) arrested Mawlawi Abdullah aka Aslam Farooqui, the so-called emir of ISKP, in Nangarhar province for the Kabul gurdwara attack in which one Indian and 26 Afghan Sikhs were killed. A Pakistani national, Farooqui was earlier associated with Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which operates in collaboration with the Haqqani network in Kabul and Jalalabad, and the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan before he took over as ISKP chief in April 2019 after replacing Mawlawi Zia-ul-Haq aka Abu Omar Khorasani. A Mamozai tribesman from the Orakzai agency on the Pak-Afghan border, Farooqui was arrested along with four other Pakistani nationals. A Kasargod, Kerala, resident Muhsin Tikripur was killed in the Gurudwara attack.After the Taliban over-ran Kabul, Farooqui was released like other terrorists from Afghan jails. He was last lodged in the Bagram jail.Also read | Saleh says Taliban denying ISIS link is like Pak denial on Quetta ShuraWhat is interesting about Farooqui is that while India was denied permission by the coalition forces to interrogate, the Pakistan Foreign Ministry sought custody of the ISKP chief ostensibly on the grounds that he was involved in anti-Pakistan activities. The fact is that the Afghan ambassador to Pakistan was summoned by the Pakistan Foreign Office and the demand to hand over Farooqui was conveyed as the fear was that the ISKP chief would spill out all his affiliations with the Pakistani deep state. However, thanks to the institutionalised channels between the Pakistan and UK intelligence agencies, Farooqui was apparently never interrogated on those lines. The then Afghan government rejected the Pakistani demand and made it clear that Farooqui would be tried under Afghan laws as he had committed crimes against the Hazara Shias and Sikhs.Even though the Taliban does not recognize the presence of TTP in their second home or Pakistan, the two terrorist groups operate on both sides of Durand Lines with the US as their common enemy. The Farooqui case shows that terrorist groups in the Af-Pak region may operate with different brand names but the product and factory are the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/curious-case-of-iskp-emir-aslam-farooqui-and-pak-links-101630036129925.html

Noting that the "Talibs have learned very well from the master", the Afghan leader said that every piece of evidence that is currently in hand points to the fact that the ISIS in Khorasan, also known as ISIS-K, have their roots in the Taliban and the Haqqani network, particularly the ones operating in Kabul.Also Read | Joe Biden to Kabul attackers: 'We will hunt you down and make you pay'"Every evidence we have in hand shows that IS-K cells have their roots in Talibs and Haqqani network particularly the ones operating in Kabul," the acting president of Afghanistan wrote in a tweet from his official handle on Friday.

27-08-2021||World||Fatigue, shortness of breath last a year for many Covid-19 patients, says study||Covid-19 symptoms like fatigue and shortness of breath still trouble many patients a year after their hospitalisation for the coronavirus disease, according to a new Chinese study. The study published in the British medical journal The Lancet stated that around half of Covid-19 patients discharged from the hospital still suffer from at least one persistent symptom, most often fatigue or muscle weakness after a year, reports AFP.The researchers noted that one in three patients still have shortness of breath a year after their diagnosis and the number is even higher in patients who are severely affected by the disease. "With no proven treatments or even rehabilitation guidance, long Covid affects people's ability to resume normal life and their capacity to work. The study shows that for many patients, full recovery from Covid-19 will take more than 1 year," The Lancet said in an editorial published with the study.The study observed about 1,300 people hospitalised for Covid-19 between January and May 2020 in China's Wuhan, the epicentre of the disease. The share of observed Covid-19 patients with at least one symptom decreased from 68 per cent after six months to 49 per cent after 12 months.The study found respiratory discomfort increased from 26 per cent of patients after six months to 30 per cent after 12 months. It also found affected women were 43 per cent more likely than affected men to suffer from fatigue or persistent muscle weakness and twice as likely to be diagnosed with anxiety or depression.The study adds to its earlier research that warned authorities in different nations that they must be prepared to provide long-term support to health workers and patients affected by Covid-19. "Long Covid is a modern medical challenge of the first order," the editorial said. It called for more research to understand the condition and better care for patients who suffer from it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fatigue-shortness-of-breath-last-a-year-for-many-covid-19-patients-says-study-101630029817148.html
27-08-2021||World||Microsoft warns thousands of cloud customers of exposed databases||Microsoft on Thursday warned thousands of its cloud computing customers, including some of the world's largest companies, that intruders could have the ability to read, change or even delete their main databases, according to a copy of the email and a cyber security researcher.The vulnerability is in Microsoft Azure's flagship Cosmos DB database. A research team at security company Wiz discovered it was able to access keys that control access to databases held by thousands of companies. Wiz Chief Technology Officer Ami Luttwak is a former chief technology officer at Microsoft's Cloud Security Group.Because Microsoft cannot change those keys by itself, it emailed the customers Thursday telling them to create new ones. Microsoft agreed to pay Wiz $40,000 for finding the flaw and reporting it, according to an email it sent to Wiz.Microsoft said it had no immediate comment.Microsoft's email to customers said it has fixed the vulnerability and that there was no evidence the flaw had been exploited. "We have no indication that external entities outside the researcher (Wiz) had access to the primary read-write key," the email said.“This is the worst cloud vulnerability you can imagine. It is a long-lasting secret,” Luttwak told Reuters. “This is the central database of Azure, and we were able to get access to any customer database that we wanted.”Luttwak's team found the problem, dubbed ChaosDB, on Aug. 9 and notified Microsoft Aug. 12, Luttwak said.The flaw was in a visualization tool called Jupyter Notebook, which has been available for years but was enabled by default in Cosmos beginning in February. After Reuters reported on the flaw, Wiz detailed the issue https://www.wiz.io/blog/chaosdb-how-we-hacked-thousands-of-azure-customers-databases in a blog post.Luttwak said even customers who have not been notified by Microsoft could have had their keys swiped by attackers, giving them access until those keys are changed. Microsoft only told customers whose keys were visible this month, when Wiz was working on the issue.The disclosure comes after months of bad security news for Microsoft. The company was breached by the same suspected Russian government hackers that infiltrated SolarWinds, who stole Microsoft source code. Then a wide number of hackers broke into Exchange email servers while a patch was being developed.A recent fix for a printer flaw that allowed computer takeovers had to be redone repeatedly. Another Exchange flaw last week prompted an urgent U.S. government warning https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/08/21/urgent-protect-against-active-exploitation-proxyshell that customers need to install patches issued months ago because ransomware gangs are now exploiting it.Problems with Azure are especially troubling, because Microsoft and outside security experts have been pushing companies to abandon most of their own infrastructure and rely on the cloud for more security.But though cloud attacks are more rare, they can be more devastating when they occur. What's more, some are never publicized.A federally contracted research lab tracks all known security flaws in software and rates them by severity. But there is no equivalent system for holes in cloud architecture, so many critical vulnerabilities remain undisclosed to users, Luttwak said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/microsoft-warns-thousands-of-cloud-customers-of-exposed-databases-101630030340811.html
27-08-2021||World||From suicide bombings to brutal executions: Key things to know about ISIS-K behind Kabul airport||ISIS-K or Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) has claimed responsibility for the suicide attacks on the Kabul airport, which killed scores including Afghans trying to leave Afghanistan and at least 13 US service members. Islamic State said a suicide bomber "managed to reach a large gathering of translators and collaborators with the American army at 'Baran Camp' near Kabul Airport and detonated his explosive belt among them, killing about 60 people and wounding more than 100 others, including Taliban fighters."Reports have said that ISIS-K, the regional affiliate of ISIS or Islamic State that is active in Afghanistan and Pakistan, had long planned attacks on American personnel and others. The Taliban condemned the blasts outside the Kabul airport on Thursday.What is ISIS-K?ISIS-K is named after an old term for the region now lying in northeastern Iran, southern Turkmenistan and northern Afghanistan and first appeared in eastern Afghanistan in late 2014 and quickly established a reputation for extreme brutality. It was founded by hardline elements of the Pakistani Taliban who fled into Afghanistan when Pakistan security forces cracked down on them, according to some experts on Islamist militancy in the region.Also read | 'We will hunt you down': Biden to Kabul attackersUS intelligence officials have earlier told CNN the ISIS-K membership includes "a small number of veteran jihadists from Syria and other foreign terrorist fighters,". They have said that the US had identified 10 to 15 of their top operatives in Afghanistan.What's their location?The group has built up a presence in eastern Afghanistan in recent years, especially in the provinces of Nangahar and Kunar. ISIS-K has formed cells in Kabul which have carried out a number of devastating suicide attacks in and beyond the Afghan capital since 2016. ISIS-K, which was initially confined to a small number of areas on the border with Pakistan, has established a second major front in northern provinces including Jawzjan and Faryab.ISIS-K includes Pakistanis from other militant groups and Uzbek extremists in addition to Afghans, the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point said.How did it strengthen its position?US intelligence officials have said that the movement used the instability that led to the collapse of the Western-backed government in Afghanistan earlier this month to strengthen its position and step up recruitment of disenfranchised Taliban members.Also read | US says more attacks likely as Biden vows to avenge deadly Kabul airport blasts"ISIS-Khorasan exploited the political instability and rise in violence during the quarter by attacking minority sectarian targets and infrastructure to spread fear and highlight the Afghan government's inability to provide adequate security," the US defense department inspector general for Afghanistan (SIGAR) said in a report.Are they linked to the Taliban?While ISIS and the Taliban are both hardline Sunni Islamist terrorists, they are rivals and oppose each other. ISIS-K have major differences with the Taliban and accuse them of abandoning Jihad and the battlefield in favour of a negotiated peace settlement hammered out in "posh hotels" in Doha, Qatar.According to the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University, their differences are also ideological. "The hostility between the two groups arose both from ideological differences and competition for resources. IS accused the Taliban of drawing its legitimacy from a narrow ethnic and nationalistic base, rather than a universal Islamic creed," the center said.Also watch | Inside 10 days of Taliban rule: Living in fear amid pockets of resistanceThe Associated Press has reported that as the Taliban sought to negotiate with the US in recent years, many of those opposed to these talks switched over to the more extremist Islamic State.Also read | US flag to fly at half-mast until August 30 in honour of Kabul attack victimsResearchers have said that there are strong links between ISIS-K and the Haqqani network, which in turn is closely linked to the Taliban. "Several major attacks between 2019 and 2021 involved collaboration between ISIS-K, the Taliban's Haqqani Network and other terror groups based in Pakistan," Dr Sajjan Gohel from the Asia Pacific Foundation told the BBC.What have they targeted?ISIS-K has carried out a series of suicide bombings in Kabul and other cities against both government and foreign military targets. Experts have said these were aimed at establishing their credentials as a more violent and extreme militant movement.From the executions of village elders to the killings of Red Cross workers and suicide attacks on crowds, including a series of bloody suicide operations against targets associated with the Shi'ite minority, have been blamed on the group.Among its recent targets was a Sufi mosque, electrical pylons and fuel tankers and Shi'ite bus passengers in Kabul. US officials also believe an attack on a girls school for the mainly Shi'ite Hazara minority was the work of ISIS-K.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/key-things-to-know-about-isis-k-group-behind-kabul-airport-attack-101630028830242.html

Speaking with emotion at the White House, Biden seemingly addressed the Islamic State (IS)-affiliated extremists responsible for the attack and said that the United States will neither forget nor forgive the act. “To those who carried out this attack as well as anyone who wishes America harm know this: We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay,” Biden declared.Also Read | Terror in heart of Kabul, explosions rock airportMore than 60 Afghans were killed and at least 140 turned up with serious injuries after a series of deadly blasts at Kabul in Afghanistan, according to the country's ministry of public health. At least 13 US service members were also killed in the attacks, which included a suicide bombing at the airport, while 18 more were left injured. The US Marine Corps said 10 Marines were also among those killed; however, the central command did not identify the dead by service.The attacks come amid the evacuation efforts led by the US and other countries to get people out of the Afghan capital ahead of Biden's August 31 withdrawal deadline. As many as 1,000 Americans and many more Afghans are still struggling to get out of Kabul, according to the Associated Press.US president Joe Biden, in his White House address following the Kabul attacks, asked for a moment of silence to honour the fallen service members, bowing his head, and ordered US flags to be flown half-staff across the country. "We have some reason to believe we know who they are... not certain," Biden said while referring to the bombers and gunmen involved in the attack, adding that military commanders have been instructed to develop plans to strike IS "assets, leadership, and facilities."Also Read | India condemns Kabul airport attackCNN reports the ISIS in Khorasan, also known as ISIS-K, has claimed that the suicide attack at the Kabul airport was carried out by an ISIS bomber, a threat that the US defense department had warned of earlier this year.The IS affiliate in Afghanistan has carried out many attacks on civilian targets in the country in recent years. It is far more radical than the Taliban, who seized power less than two weeks ago. The most heralded American attack on the group came in April 2017 when the US dropped the largest conventional bomb in its arsenal on an IS cave and tunnel complex. The group more recently is believed to have concentrated in urban areas, which could complicate US efforts to target them without harming civilians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-kabul-attackers-we-will-hunt-you-down-and-make-you-pay-101630023310160.html

27-08-2021||World||It was 'last resort': Capitol Police officer who shot woman supporter of Trump||The US Capitol Police officer who fatally shot a woman as she tried to force her way into the House of Representatives during the Jan. 6 attack said the shooting was a "last resort" because he believed she posed a threat to members of Congress."I tried to wait as long as I could," police Lieutenant Michael Byrd said in an interview with "NBC Nightly News" that aired on Thursday, in what were his first public remarks since the violence."I hoped and prayed no one tried to enter through those doors. But their failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers."Byrd described the shooting as an act of "last resort" as he spoke publicly three days after a review by the Capitol Police concluded he had acted lawfully and within department policy in shooting the supporter of then-President Donald Trump as she tried to force her way through a smashed window into the House of Representatives' Speaker's Lobby."It was a very terrifying situation," Byrd said.The shooting of Ashli Babbitt, 35, came on a day of violence that saw hundreds of Trump supporters fight their way into the Capitol, attacking police and sending lawmakers running.Babbitt was a US Air Force veteran who embraced far-right conspiracy theories on social media, including Trump's false assertions that his 2020 presidential election loss was due to fraud. She was one of four participants in the riot to die on Jan. 6.Far-right groups have embraced Babbitt as a martyr, arguing she was murdered. Her cause has also been taken up by Trump, who falsely claimed last month that the officer who shot her was the "head of security" for a "high-ranking" Democratic member of Congress.VIOLENCE RECOUNTEDPolice officers who fought the mob recounted scenes of violence in which rioters beat them, taunted them with racist insults and threatened to kill an officer "with his own gun" in testimony last month to a congressional committee.A Capitol Police officer who had been attacked by rioters died the following day. Four police officers who took part in the defense of the Capitol later took their own lives. More than 100 police officers were injured.The Capitol Police review of the shooting concluded that it may have saved lives."The actions of the officer in this case potentially saved Members and staff from serious injury and possible death from a large crowd of rioters," the department said. It added that the officer's family had "been the subject of numerous credible and specific threats."The Justice Department in April closed its investigation into the death of Babbitt, saying there was no evidence that the officer had acted criminally in the shooting.The worst violence at the Capitol since the War of 1812 delayed the certification of Democratic President Joe Biden's election victory by several hours and brought a huge military presence into the city for several months.Trump supporters, including some of his Republican allies in Congress, have since tried to play down the day's events. Representative Andrew Clyde, who was photographed on Jan. 6 helping to barricade the House chamber door against attackers, has since compared the mob to "a normal tourist visit."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-was-last-resort-capitol-police-officer-who-shot-woman-supporter-of-trump-101630024102836.html

Islamic State claimed responsibility for the twin explosions in a statement and said one of its suicide bombers had targeted "translators and collaborators with the American army."A US official told Reuters the number of US personnel killed was likely to rise even higher. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, head of the US military's Central Command, told reporters the explosions were followed by gunfight. McKenzie said the threat from Islamic State persists alongside "other active threat streams." "We believe it is their desire to continue these attacks and we expect those attacks to continue - and we're doing everything we can to be prepared," McKenzie said, according to Reuters.Also read | India condemns Kabul airport attackMcKenzie also said that potential attacks could include rockets being fired at the Kabul airport or car bombs trying to get in. They were the first US troops killed in Afghanistan since February 2020 and were the deadliest incident for American soldiers in the country in a decade.The Trump administration struck an agreement with the Taliban in that month last year that called for the hardline Islamist group to halt attacks on Americans in exchange for a US agreement to remove all American troops and contractors by May 2021. Biden announced in April that he would have all US troops out by August."We will not forgive, we will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay," an emotional Biden said in remarks at the White House adding that US evacuations would continue. "I have also ordered my commanders to develop operational plans to strike ISIS-K assets, leadership and facilities.

27-08-2021||World||Twin explosions leave Kabul shaken||The international community reacted with alarm after deadly terror attacks rocked the airport in the Afghan capital, with the UN condemning the day’s developments and the Nato insisting that evacuation efforts in Kabul shouldn’t be halted.“This incident underscores the volatility of the situation on the ground in Afghanistan, but also strengthens our resolve as we continue to deliver urgent assistance across the country in support of the Afghan people,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters.In Brussels, Nato secretarygeneral Jens Stoltenberg said allied forces should continue to evacuate as many vulnerable people as they can from Kabul despite what he branded a “horrific terrorist attack”.“Our priority remains to evacuate as many people to safety as quickly as possible,” he tweeted after two deadly explosions hit crowds on the perimeter of the airport in Afghanistan’s capital.The attacks hit ahead of an August 31 deadline for US troops to leave the airport on the outskirts of the Afghan capital, and as allied militaries wind down their rescue operations.Belgium and the Netherlands have already halted their airlift from the airport and other allied countries are to follow suit in the coming hours and days, despite fears that at-risk people will be left behind.Taliban group ‘strongly condemns’ attacksThe Taliban have condemned the attacks outside Kabul’s airport, saying they occurred in an area controlled by US forces. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said his group “strongly condemns” Thursday’s strikes and is paying close attention to security. The attack was believed to be carried out by Afghanistan’s Islamic State group affiliate, which is separate from and more radical than the Taliban.Instability feeding terrorism, rues EUEuropean Council president Charles Michel said he was very concerned about a blast outside the Kabul airport, warning that instability in Afghanistan must not benefit terrorism. “Securing safe passage to the airport remains vital,” said Michel, the chairman of the 27 national leaders of all the member countries of the European Union.“We need to ensure the current instability cannot give rise to a resurgence of terrorism.”The deadly attacks came hours after western nations warned earlier on Thursday of a possible terror attack on Kabul’s airport, where thousands have flocked as they try to flee Taliban-controlled Afghanistan in the closing stages of a massive international airlift. Britain had clearly warned an attack could happen within hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twin-explosions-leave-kabul-shaken-101630019914032.html

Biden said US intelligence had determined that militants from ISIS-K, an affiliate of Islamic State in Afghanistan, were likely behind the blasts.Also Read | Afghanistan: ISIS claims responsibility as dozens die in Kabul airport blastsGeneral Kenneth McKenzie, head of US Central Command, said he expects more attacks as the US moves to continue evacuations and pull American forces out of Afghanistan by Aug. 31. The US State Department said it’s in contact with about 1,000 Americans it believes remain in Afghanistan and over two-thirds of them indicated they’re taking steps to exit the country.“We will rescue the Americans who are there,” Biden said. “We will get our Afghan allies out.”Biden was briefed on the attacks earlier Thursday by his national security team. The violence disrupted his schedule for the day, with the White House scrapping a planned virtual meeting between the president and governors over resettling Afghan refugees and delaying a meeting between Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett.The US and other nations had warned their citizens not to congregate near the airport in recent hours, citing a credible threat of a terrorist attack. Earlier in the week, Biden had warned that continued US operations in the country faced a growing risk of targeting by ISIS-K. It was unclear in the immediate aftermath of Thursday’s bombings who was responsible.Biden had previously said that he planned to withdraw all US forces by Aug. 31, but left open the possibility of a continued presence if needed to evacuate American citizens seeking to flee the country after the Taliban takeover earlier this month. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, called on Speaker Nancy Pelosi to bring Congress back into session to address Wednesday’s attack, adding that “our enemies have taken advantage of the chaotic nature of the withdrawal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabul-airport-blasts-joe-biden-promises-to-retaliate-evacuations-to-continue-101630014940259.html
27-08-2021||World||Covid-19 deaths worldwide near 4.5mn mark||The coronavirus disease has killed at least 4,461,431 people since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP on Thursday.The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the Covid-19 pandemic’s overall toll could be two to three times higher than official records, due to the excess mortality that is directly and indirectly linked to Covid-19.On Wednesday, 11,899 new deaths and 767,147 new cases were recorded worldwide.Meanwhile, Australia’s new daily cases of Covid-19 topped 1,000 on Thursday for the first time since the global pandemic began, as two major hospitals in Sydney set up emergency outdoor tents to help deal with a rise in patients.New South Wales state, where Sydney is the capital, reported 1,029 new cases, exceeding the previous record of 919 a day earlier. Of the new cases, 969 were detected in greater Sydney, up from 838. The rapid rise in Covid-19 patients has forced Sydney’s Westmead and Blacktown hospitals, which service the city’s sprawling western suburbs, to erect tents to screen and swab patients to help manage capacity.Also, Japan suspended the use of 1.63mn doses of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine on Thursday, more than a week after the domestic distributor received reports of contaminants in some vials.Both Japan and Moderna said that no safety or efficacy issues had been identified and that the suspension was just a precaution. “Moderna confirms having been notified of cases of particulate matter being seen in drug product vials of its Covid-19 vaccine,” Moderna said.The US is projected to see nearly 100,000 more deaths between now and December 1, according to the nation’s most closely watched forecasting model. “Behaviour is really going to determine if, when and how sustainably the current wave subsides,” said Lauren Ancel Meyers, director of the University of Texas Covid-19 Modelling Consortium. “We cannot stop Delta in its tracks, but we can change our behaviour overnight.”Vaccinations in Africa tripled over the past week, though protecting even 10% of the continent by the end of September remains “a very daunting task”, the Africa director of WHO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-deaths-worldwide-near-4-5mn-mark-101630014020328.html
27-08-2021||World||Trump, Republican lawmakers lash out at Biden after Kabul attack||Former president Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers lashed out at Democratic President Joe Biden on Thursday after 12 US troops were killed and 15 wounded in suicide bombings in Kabul.Trump, who has been sharply critical of Biden's handling of the Afghan crisis, called Thursday's suicide attacks in Kabul a "tragedy" and said they should have been prevented."This tragedy should never have been allowed to happen, which makes our grief even deeper and more difficult to understand," said Trump, whose administration -- in a February 2020 deal with the Taliban -- committed the United States to a full withdrawal from Afghanistan.Several Republican lawmakers said Biden should resign or be impeached."Joe Biden is responsible," said Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri. "It is now clear beyond all doubt that he has neither the capacity nor the will to lead. He must resign."Representative Elise Stefanik, the third-ranking Republican in the House, tweeted that "Joe Biden has blood on his hands.""The buck stops with the President of the United States," Stefanik said."This horrific national security and humanitarian disaster is solely the result of Joe Biden's weak and incompetent leadership. He is unfit to be Commander-in-Chief."The Republican minority leader of the House of Representatives urged Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker, to call the chamber back from recess to address the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan."It is time for Congress to act quickly to save lives," Representative Kevin McCarthy said. "Our enemies have taken advantage of the chaotic nature of the withdrawal."McCarthy said Pelosi "must bring Congress back into session before August 31 so that we can be briefed thoroughly and comprehensively by the Biden administration."McCarthy also called on Biden to "take decisive action to protect our troops, our citizens, and our allies without regard for an arbitrary deadline."Speaking on Tuesday -- two days before the attack on Kabul airport -- Biden said he was sticking with his plan to complete the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan by August 31.Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell called the Kabul attack "enraging" and said "we need to redouble our global efforts to confront these barbarian enemies who want to kill our Americans and attack our homeland."A suicide bombing at Kabul airport, where an international airlift has been underway since the Taliban seized power, and another at a nearby hotel killed 12 US servicemen and wounded 15 on Thursday, according to the Pentagon, along with an unspecified number of Afghans.Drew Hammill, Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, dismissed McCarthy's call as an "empty stunt" and said the Biden administration has repeatedly briefed members of Congress.In a statement, Pelosi ignored McCarthy's call for the House to be called back from recess but said Congress "must continue to be kept closely informed" about developments in Afghanistan.The House adjourned for its fall recess on August 24 and is scheduled to return on September 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-republican-lawmakers-lash-out-at-biden-after-kabul-attack-101630013666228.html
27-08-2021||World||‘Everything is chaos here at the moment’||A former British Royal Marine who runs an animal shelter in Afghanistan says he and his staff were caught up in the aftermath of the explosion near the Kabul airport.Paul “Pen” Farthing said the group was outside the airport when the blast occurred on Thursday. “We’re fine but everything is chaos here at the moment,” he told Britain’s Press Association news agency. “All of a sudden we heard gunshots and our vehicle was targeted, had our driver not turned around he would have been shot in the head by a man with an AK-47.“We’ve been in the airport, and back out of the airport; the whole thing’s a mess,” he added.Farthing is trying to get staff of his Nowzad charity out of Afghanistan, along with the group’s rescued animals.They have been stuck outside Kabul’s airport as they try to get a flight out. He spoke just after the first reports emerged of two suicide bombings outside the airport.UK tells airlines to avoid flying below 25,000 feetBritain has issued a notice to airlines to avoid flying below 25,000 feet (7,620 metres) over Afghanistan after the twin attacks near Kabul airport on Thursday. “Following the shocking scenes in Afghanistan today, I have issued a NOTAM (Notice to Aviation) further advising airlines to avoid Afghan airspace under 25,000ft,” said Grant Shapps, the transport minister. “We will continue to keep this under review.”German Chancellor calls off trip to IsraelChancellor Angela Merkel has called off a planned weekend visit to Israel because of the situation in Afghanistan, the German government announced on Thursday.Merkel was due to travel to Israel on Saturday for her first trip to the country since Naftali Bennett succeeded Benjamin Netanyahu as the country’s prime minister. Her visit had been due to last until Monday.It was called off in consultation with PM Bennett “because of current developments in Afghanistan,” Merkel’s office said in a statement.Germany is one of the countries that has been scrambling to evacuate from Kabul its own nationals and Afghans who helped its forces during a nearly-two decade deployment in the country.Merkel’s office said the intention is for the chancellor to go ahead with her visit at an unspecified later time. Merkel is approaching the end of her time in office. She isn’t running in Germany’s national election on September 26 but it isn’t yet clear when she will step down. In Germany, the outgoing government stays in office until a new one is sworn in, and forming a coalition can be a time-consuming process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/everything-is-chaos-here-at-the-moment-101630013502172.html
27-08-2021||World||Terror in heart of Kabul, explosions rock airport||A group of suicide attackers and gunmen targeted crowds outside the Kabul airport amid a massive and chaotic evacuation effort from Afghanistan on Thursday, killing 64 people including four US troops, according to The Wall Street Journal, and raising serious questions about the security of flights by countries such as the US and India.The attackers, including two suicide bombers, launched their assault at a gate where crowds of Afghans had gathered to get into the airport, the only way out of the country since it was taken over by the Taliban on August 15.“We can confirm that a number of US service members were killed in today’s complex attack on Kabul airport,” said Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby. “A number of others are being treated for wounds,” he said, calling it a “heinous attack”.A senior Afghan official told WSJ that at least 60 Afghans were killed in the attack, with many more wounded,US officials said they were concerned that further attacks could occur at the airport following the twin blasts, which a Taliban official earlier on Thursday said killed between 13 to 20 people, including children.Western officials had warned of a major attack, urging people to leave the airport, but that advice went largely unheeded by Afghans desperate to escape the country in the last few days of an American-led evacuation before the US officially ends its 20-year presence on August 31.There was no claim of responsibility for the attack. Reuters cited a source familiar with US congressional briefings as saying that American officials strongly believe the Afghan affiliate of Islamic State, known as Islamic State-Khorasan, was responsible.The attack came just a day after a group of 140 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus was barred from accessing Kabul airport by the Taliban. The group was scheduled to join others on a military flight that was set to bring back more than 180 people to New Delhi, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.The flight subsequently brought back 24 Indians and 11 Nepalese citizens from Kabul. The people cited above said it was too early to say whether India would mount more evacuation flights from Kabul before the August 31 deadline for the complete drawdown of US and foreign forces from Afghanistan.There was no official response from the Indian side to the attack, which came in the wake of several reports of a possible attack by the Islamic State on Kabul airport. A small team of Indian officials continues to be deployed at the airport to coordinate with other countries for the evacuation effort.Two explosionsPentagon spokesperson John Kirby initially tweeted that an explosion at Abbey gate of Kabul airport was the “result of a complex attack that resulted in a number of US & civilian casualties”. He also confirmed another explosion “at or near the Baron Hotel”, located a short distance from Abbey gate.Abbey gate was the entrance being used by American citizens for evacuation flights. Baron Hotel, located about 300 metres from the site of the first explosion, was being used by British troops as a base for evacuating UK citizens. There were reports that foreign troops began sealing and welding shut the airport gate.Videos and photos following the attack showed dozens of people lying prone in pools of blood outside the airport, including in a sewage canal near the perimeter fence where scores of Afghans had lined up for their documents to be checked. The videos suggested that the toll could be higher than the official figures. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said: “The blast at Kabul airport will indeed complicate the evacuation process. While it’s not clear who carried out the suicide attack, what’s clear is that it was designed to drive away or empty out the surging crowds at the airport waiting for evacuation. It’s also a signal to the civilians that there will be consequences if they try to flee the Taliban rule.”Biden holds meetingThe United States has been racing to carry out the airlift before its military is set to fully withdraw from the country by August 31. There was no indication from the White House that Biden plans to change the August 31 withdrawal target as a result of the attacks, a source familiar with the situation said.Biden was in a meeting with security officials about the situation in Afghanistan, where the US is in the final steps of ending its 20-year war, when the explosion was first reported, according to a person familiar with the matter.Biden, secretary of state Tony Blinken, defense secretary Lloyd Austin, Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman General Mark Milley and vice president Kamala Harris monitored events via video links.In an alert issued on Wednesday, the US Embassy in Kabul had advised citizens to avoid travelling to the airport and said those already at the gates should leave immediately, citing unspecified “security threats”.A Western diplomat in Kabul said that areas outside the airport gates had been “incredibly crowded” again despite the warnings.Taliban ‘condemn’ attackViolence from Islamic State, if confirmed, creates a headache for the Taliban who have promised that their victory will bring peace to Afghanistan at last. Fighters claiming allegiance to IS began appearing in eastern Afghanistan at the end of 2014 and have established a reputation for extreme brutality.The Taliban did not identify the attackers, but a spokesperson described them as “evil circles”.“We strongly condemn this gruesome incident and will take every step to bring the culprits to justice,” said Taliban official Suhail Shaheen on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/terror-in-heart-of-kabul-explosions-rock-airport-101630013358160.html
27-08-2021||World||Afghanistan: ISIS claims responsibility as dozens die in Kabul airport blasts||Two Islamic State suicide bombers attacked crowds of people gathered outside Kabul airport Thursday hoping to flee Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, killing dozens including 12 US troops, the Pentagon said.The country's new Taliban rulers said the blasts killed between 13 and 20 people. A health official in the previous government said the toll could rise to 60.The blasts came as the August 31 deadline looms for the United States to withdraw its troops, and for it and other Western countries to end a massive airlift that has already evacuated nearly 100,000 people.The airport is the only part of the country under foreign control following the Taliban's return to power on August 15, and huge crowds have massed in the hope of being evacuated.Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban's main spokesman, told AFP that "between 13 and 20" people were killed and 52 wounded in the twin blasts, while Kabul hospitals reported six dead and up to 90 wounded.A health official in the pre-Taliban administration said the death toll could rise to 60, but said he could not be named and other sources could not confirm the figure.Twelve US troops were killed in the attack and 15 wounded, said General Kenneth McKenzie, head of the US Central Command.He said the blasts have been assessed as coming from Islamic State suicide bombers, and that the US airlift would continue despite the attack."ISIS will not deter us from accomplishing the mission," he said.The United States expects more Islamic State attacks in Kabul and is prepared to retaliate, McKenzie told a news conference.US President Joe Biden had earlier cited an "acute" terrorist threat from the regional chapter of the Islamic State jihadist group.The Taliban condemned the blasts, and said they happened in an area under US military control."The Islamic Emirate strongly condemns the bombing targeting civilians at Kabul airport," said a statement released by Mujahid on Twitter.'Total panic'Graphic video shared on social media showed bodies lying semi-submerged in a canal adjacent to the airport, where thousands have gathered since the Taliban takeover of August 15 hoping for a flight out.Also Read | India condemns Kabul airport attack"When people heard the (first) explosion there was total panic," a man name Milad told AFP."The Taliban then started firing in the air to disperse the crowd. I saw a man rushing with an injured baby in his hands."The US government and its allies had raised the alarm earlier in the day with a series of advisories warning their citizens to avoid the airport.No specifics were given, but Belgium's Prime Minister Alexander De Croo referred to a threat from suicide bombers.London also issued a warning to its citizens, saying "if you can leave Afghanistan safely by other means, you should do so immediately".'Truly heartbreaking'There were reports on social media late Thursday of a third blast north of the airport, but further details were not immediately available.After the blasts, images posted on social media showed men ferrying injured people to safety in wheelbarrows.In another picture, a boy was seen clutching the arm of a man whose clothes were soaked in blood.In the confusion after the first blast Thursday, one man said he dropped the documents he hoped would help him board a flight with his wife and three children."I will never ever want to go (to the airport) again. Death to America, its evacuation and visas," he said.More than 95,000 Afghans and foreigners have fled Afghanistan via the US-led airlift since the hardline Taliban movement took control of the country.Despite security warnings, huge crowds of people desperate to flee the Taliban continued to throng the airport, their bid for a way out becoming increasingly anxious ahead of next Tuesday's deadline set by Biden to end evacuations and withdraw troops.Biden has not budged on the hard deadline -- even as some foreign nations warned they would be forced to leave at-risk Afghans behind.Shortly after the blasts the White House said Biden was being briefed on the attack, delaying a planned meeting with Israel's visiting prime minister and cancelling another event.Several Western allies have already wrapped up their airlift operations including Canada, whose government said it was "truly heartbreaking" to leave behind those who wanted to be rescued.Germany's defence minister said Berlin has pulled out all its soldiers, while Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the "heinous" attack.Islamic State threatIn recent years, the Islamic State's Afghanistan-Pakistan chapter has been responsible for some of the deadliest attacks in those countries.It has massacred civilians at mosques, shrines, public squares and even hospitals.The group has especially targeted Muslims from sects it considers heretical, including Shiites.But while IS and the Taliban are both hardline Sunni Islamist militants, they are rivals and oppose each other.The Taliban have promised a softer brand of rule from their first stint in power, which ended in 2001 when the United States invaded because they gave sanctuary to Al-Qaeda.But many Afghans fear a repeat of the Taliban's brutal interpretation of sharia law, as well as violent retribution for working with foreign militaries, Western missions or the previous US-backed government.There are particular concerns for women, who were largely banned from education and employment and could only leave the house with a male chaperone during the group's 1996-2001 rule.Some of the Afghans massed outside the airport have foreign passports, visas or eligibility to travel, but most do not.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/isis-claims-responsibility-as-dozens-die-in-kabul-airport-blasts-101630008548607.html
