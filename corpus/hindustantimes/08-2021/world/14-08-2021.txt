Likewise, the owner of our consulate premises in Herat received a call from the Taliban to come to the building with keys,” a source said.Also Read: Taliban set hard conditions for peace talks with Afghan govt82 districts in the country are now under the Afghanistan government, while 252 are under the control of the Taliban and the status of 92 are disputed. The Afghan government has claimed that in the last 24 hours, in which the Taliban have taken over the Angoor Adda border crossing between Paktika Province and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan, 172 Taliban were killed and 107 wounded as a result of ANDSF operations in Nangarhar, Logar, Maidan Wardak, Kandahar and Balkh Provinces.The Taliban captured Asadabad, the provincial capital of Kunar; Sharan, the provincial capital of Paktika; and Gardez, the provincial capital of Paktia, taking the number of Provincial capitals under its control to 20 out of 34. Taliban also captured Sarawazah district of Paktika and Shigal district of Kunar Province. Besides, the Taliban set free the prisoners after taking over Central prisons in Gardez, Sharan and Maimanah (Farhan). The US Embassy in Kabul is now planning to reduce its strength to a bare minimum by August 17.On Saturday, President Ashraf Ghani addressed his countrymen and promised that the situation will not be allowed to escalate anymore as the Afghan leadership is in talks with world leaders to mobilise the army. An Afghan leaders' delegation would leave for Islamabad on August 15, which will include Yunus Qanooni, Mohammad Karim Khalili, Ustaad Mohaqiq, Ahmad Zia Masoud, Khalid Noor, Latif Pedram, Syed Mansoor Naderi (all non-Pashtuns), and Kalimullah Naqibi, a Pashtun but affiliated to the Jamiat-e-Islami.Another Afghan delegation under Abdullah Abdullah would visit Doha. Abdullah has an ‘important ‘ meeting in Kabul on Sunday and would, therefore, not leave for Doha tonight, as was earlier expected, sources said. Leaders of Afghan refugees in Iran on Saturday issued a joint statement urging the international community to prevent human catastrophe due to internal displacement and called for a session of the UNSC to address the issue. Separately, the Iranian culture ministry has asked its media to refrain from using terms such as “brutality” (vahsigari) for the Taliban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-lock-indian-consulates-for-security-in-kandahar-herat-sources-101628961008987.html
14-08-2021||World||Taliban capture Mazar-e-Sharif, 4th largest Afghan city||Mazar-e-Sharif, the fourth-largest city in Afghanistan, fell to the Taliban on Saturday after a multipronged assault launched by insurgents, according to a lawmaker.Balkh lawmaker Abas Ebrahimzada said the province’s national army corps surrendered first, which prompted the pro-government militias and other forces to lose morale and give up in the face of the onslaught.According to the lawmaker, all of the provincial installations, including the governor’s office, are in Taliban hands.The insurgents have captured much of northern, western and southern Afghanistan in a breakneck offensive less than three weeks before the U.S. is set to withdraw its last troops, raising fears of a full militant takeover or another Afghan civil war.The Taliban have made major advances in recent days, including capturing Herat and Kandahar, the country’s second- and third-largest cities. They now control about 20 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces, leaving the Western-backed government with a smattering of provinces in the center and east, as well as Kabul.On Saturday, the Taliban captured all of Logar province, just south of the capital, Kabul, and detained local officials, said Hoda Ahmadi, a lawmaker from the province. She said the Taliban have reached the Char Asyab district, just 11 kilometers (7 miles) south of Kabul.Insurgents also captured the capital of Paktika, bordering Pakistan, according to Khalid Asad, a lawmaker from the province. He said fighting broke out in Sharana early Saturday but ended after local elders intervened to negotiate a pullout. He said the governor and other officials surrendered and were on their way to Kabul.The Taliban also took control of Maimana, the capital of northern Faryab province, said Fawzia Raoufi, a lawmaker from the province. Maimana had been under siege for a month, and Taliban fighters entered the city days ago. Security forces finally surrendered Saturday, she said.Sayed Hussan Gerdezi, a lawmaker from the neighboring Paktia province, said the Taliban seized most of its local capital, Gardez, but that battles with government forces were still underway. The Taliban said they controlled the city.Afghan President Ashraf Ghani delivered a televised speech Saturday, his first public appearance since the recent Taliban gains. He vowed not to give up the “achievements” of the 20 years since the U.S. toppled the Taliban after the 9/11 attacks.The U.S. has continued holding peace talks between the government and the Taliban in Qatar this week, and the international community has warned that a Taliban government brought about by force would be shunned. But the insurgents appear to have little interest in making concessions as they rack up victories on the battlefield.“We have started consultations, inside the government with elders and political leaders, representatives of different levels of the community as well as our international allies," Ghani said. "Soon the results will be shared with you,” he added, without elaborating further.The president had flown to Mazar-e-Sharif on Wednesday to rally the city's defenses, meeting with several militia commanders, including Abdul Rashid Dostum and Ata Mohammad Noor, who command thousands of fighters.They remain allied with the government, but during previous rounds of fighting in Afghanistan, warlords have been known to switch sides for their own survival. Ismail Khan, a powerful former warlord who had tried to defend Herat, was captured by the Taliban when the insurgents seized the western city after two weeks of heavy fighting.Tens of thousands of Afghans have fled their homes, with many fearing a return to the Taliban’s oppressive rule. The group had previously governed Afghanistan under a harsh version of Islamic law in which women were forbidden to work or attend school, and could not leave their homes without a male relative accompanying them.Salima Mazari, one of the few female district governors in the country, said she has never even considered surrendering.“There will be no place for women,” said Mazari, who governs a district of 36,000 people near Mazar-e-Sharif. “In the provinces controlled by the Taliban, no women exist there anymore, not even in the cities. They are all imprisoned in their homes.”The withdrawal of foreign troops and the swift collapse of Afghanistan's own forces — despite hundreds of billions of dollars in U.S. aid over the years — has raised fears the Taliban could return to power or that the country could be shattered by factional fighting, as it was after the Soviet withdrawal in 1989. It's also prompted many American and Afghan veterans of the conflict to question whether two decades of blood and treasure was worth it.Afghans have been streaming into Kabul's international airport in recent days, desperate to fly out, even as more American troops have arrived to help partially evacuate the U.S. Embassy.The first Marines from a contingent of 3,000 arrived Friday. The rest are expected by Sunday, and their deployment has raised questions about whether the administration will meet its Aug. 31 withdrawal deadline.The U.S. Air Force has carried out several airstrikes to aid its Afghan allies on the ground but they appear to have done little to stem the Taliban's advance. A B-52 bomber and other warplanes traversed the country's airspace Saturday, flight-tracking data showed.The Taliban meanwhile released a video announcing the takeover of the main radio station in the southern city of Kandahar, which fell to the insurgents earlier this week, renaming it the Voice of Sharia, or Islamic law.In the video, an unnamed insurgent said all employees were present and would broadcast news, political analysis and recitations of the Quran, the Islamic holy book. It appears the station will no longer play music. It was not clear if the Taliban had purged the previous employees or allowed them to return to work.The U.S. invaded shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, which al-Qaida planned and carried out while being sheltered by Taliban. After rapidly ousting the Taliban, the U.S. shifted toward nation-building, hoping to create a modern Afghan state after decades of war and unrest.Earlier this year, President Joe Biden announced a timeline for the withdrawal of all U.S. troops by the end of August, pledging to end America's longest war. His predecessor, President Donald Trump, had reached an agreement with the Taliban to pave the way for a U.S. pullout.Biden's announcement set the latest offensive in motion. The Taliban, who have long controlled large parts of the Afghan countryside, moved quickly to seize provincial capitals, border crossings and other key infrastructure.“The security situation in the city is getting worse," said Kawa Basharat, a resident in Mazar-e-Sharif. "I want peace and stability; the fighting should be stopped.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-capture-mazar-e-sharif-4th-largest-afghan-city-101628962191945.html
14-08-2021||World||Putin urges stronger response to 'unprecedented' Siberian wildfires||Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday urged authorities to strengthen their efforts to fight wildfires across northeastern Siberia, calling the situation “unprecedented” as fires threatened people's homes.Speaking in a video call with top officials, Putin noted that 13 forest fires in the Sakha-Yakutia region are raging within five kilometers (3 miles) of populated areas and emphasized the need to closely monitor the situation to protect residents.Yakutia is the largest of Russia's 85 regions, a vast territory bigger than Argentina. It has faced a spell of particularly devastating wildfires this year following months of hot, dry weather and record-breaking temperatures. Flames previously threatened a dozen of villages, and several were evacuated. The provincial capital of Yakutsk, several other cities and hundreds of villages have been blanketed in choking smoke from the blazes.Emergencies Minister Yevgeny Zinichev reported to Putin on Saturday that his ministry has deployd 5,000 personnel, 765 vehicles and 19 aircraft to combat the wildfires in Yakutia.He said the thick smoke from wildfires has grounded firefighting planes, adding that efforts were being taken to relocate them to another base where they could operate again starting Monday. For now, firefighters have to rely exclusively on helicopters to fight the flames, Zinichev said.On Saturday, officials reported 108 active forest fires burning across nearly 1.3 million hectares (3.2 million acres) in Yakutia. Authorities have expanded a state of emergency in Yakutia to help transfer in firefighting resources from other regions.In recent years, Russia has recorded high temperatures that many scientists regard as a result of climate change. The hot weather coupled with the neglect of fire safety rules has caused a growing number of wildfires that authorities say have consumed 15 million acres this year in Russia.Experts in Russia decry a 2007 decision to disband a federal aviation network tasked to spot and combat fires and turn over its assets to regional authorities. The much-criticized transfer led to the force’s rapid decline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-urges-stronger-response-to-unprecedented-siberian-wildfires-101628961677963.html
14-08-2021||World||New terrorism threat warning by US mentions efforts of Al Qaeda||The US department of homeland security on Friday issued a new terrorism threat advisory due to the “heightened threat environment” ahead of the 20th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks. The National Terrorism Advisory System (NTAS) said in its new bulletin the United States continues to face a “diverse and challenging” threat environment, adding that the 9/11 attacks and religious holidays could serve as a catalyst for acts of targeted violence.“Today’s NTAS Bulletin advises the public about the heightened threat landscape we face and how DHS is working with our partners, at every level of government and in the community, to combat domestic terrorism and targeted violence in all its forms," secretary of homeland security Alejandro N. Mayorkas said in a statement.The terrorism threat comes at a time when the US troops are finalising their withdrawal from Afghanistan, which they invaded in the aftermath of the September 11 terror attacks. The Taliban, which was ousted by the US-led forces in 2001, has regained control over the majority of districts in Afghanistan and is gradually encircling Kabul to take back the power from the internationally recognised government of President Ashraf Ghani.US defence officials are concerned that the terror group Al Qaeda, which was behind the 9/11 attacks, could rebuild and consolidate in Afghanistan under the Taliban rule, according to US media reports.“Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula recently released its first English-language copy of Inspire magazine in over four years, which demonstrates that foreign terrorist organizations continue efforts to inspire US-based individuals susceptible to violent extremist influences,” the advisory says.The United States is also wary of threats from domestic terrorists and racially motivated violent extremists and anti-government violent extremists, the Capitol riots being a grave ultimatum. The homeland security department warned that the extremists and terror groups are increasingly exploiting online forums to spread violent extremist narratives and promote violent activity.“Such threats are also exacerbated by impacts of the ongoing global pandemic, including grievances over public health safety measures and perceived government restrictions,” the advisory added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-terrorism-threat-warning-by-us-mentions-efforts-of-al-qaeda-101628957833318.html

He also held a coordination meeting with officials where he was briefed on the security situation in Kabul and the neighbouring provinces. Reports said the meeting was attended by US Chargé d’Affaires Ross Wilson and US forces commander and both vowed support to Afghan forces.The participants in the consultative meeting agreed with Ashraf Ghani's notion that the situation can't be allowed to turn towards further instability. An authoritative team for negotiations will be assigned, it has been decided. The responsibility of this team has not been specified, but reports said they will push plans of ceasefire and an interim setup.According to reports, the Taliban are camping just 50 kilometres away from Kabul and two more provinces were captured on Saturday. Logar which is just at south of Kabul was captured by Taliban insurgents and some reports said the Taliban have reached the Chae Asyab district which is just 11 kilometres south of Kabul. The Taliban offensive gained immense pace in the last three weeks as Taliban fighters captured key provincial capitals across the country.In the televised speech he said he was consulting politicians and international leaders and he will not let the gains the country has made in the past two decades be lost. "As your president, my focus is on preventing further instability, violence, and displacement of my people," Ghani said.Qatar, which has been hosting so-far inconclusive peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban, said it had urged the insurgents to ceasefire during a meeting with their representatives on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ashraf-ghani-consults-leaders-push-for-ceasefire-in-negotiation-with-taliban-101628957474575.html

And studies cited by CDC in support of this new recommendation showed 40-44% of hospitalised breakthrough cases - those contracting Covid-19 despite being fully vaccinated - were immunocompromised people.Walensky cited another study to say emerging data suggested immunocompromised people did not develop the same level of antibodies despite the two shots as those with fully functional immune systems. Additionally, the data indicated infected immunocompromised people also transmit the virus to household contacts.The third dose followed recommendation from CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and modification of emergency use authorisation by the Food and Drug Administration.There was no word on non-mRNA vaccines such as AstraZeneca’s two-shot vaccine, which retails in India as Covishield, and Johnson & Johnson’s one-shot vaccine.Israel began administering the third dose of mRNA vaccines in July to healthcare workers and people over 60. But they would be eligible for the third only 5 months after their primacy inoculation. From August 13, Israel also started offering the third dose to those above 50.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-administer-third-dose-of-covid-vaccine-to-immunocompromised-101628951582194.html

"Due to the conflict that we're seeing across the country, many people are arriving in Kabul and other large cities, trying to seek safety for themselves and for their families," said Stephane Dujarric, the chief spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. The UN and its humanitarian partners have verified that a total of 10,350 internally displaced people arrived in Kabul between July 1 and August 12 as fighting rages on."We are not blind to the suffering of the civilians who are caught in the crossfire in urban environments,” Secretary General’s Personal Envoy on Afghanistan and Regional Issues Jean Arnault told reporters, adding that the UN is continuing to engage with the Taliban in Doha to bring about a “political solution” to the violence. “We are continuing to engage with the Taliban in Doha. We are continuing to believe that there is a political solution that can be had. This doesn’t mean that we are also blind to what is going on on the ground," Arnault said.Also Read: 'Won't allow imposed war on Afghans': President Ashraf Ghani's address amid Taliban offensiveThe UN has about 3,000 or so national staff and about 300 international staff engaged in humanitarian assistance programmes in war-torn Afghanistan, however the ongoing conflict and the resultant security challenges are proving difficult to overcome, Dujarric informed reporters. ”The United Nations stands ready to contribute to such a settlement and remains focused on providing assistance to the increasing number of Afghans in need,” he added.Dujarric expressed his alarm over the possibility of the Taliban taking over the capital city of Kabul and its impact on the population there. “It is clear that urban fighting in the city the size of Kabul would have a catastrophic impact on civilians, and we very much hope that this does not happen,” he told reporters on Thursday, adding that the UN is especially concerned “about the shift of fighting to urban areas, where the potential for civilian harm is even greater,”.The Taliban meanwhile continued to push closer to Kabul, capturing a town south of the capital that is one of the gateways to the city. The insurgent group also said they are close to capturing Maidan Shahr, another town close to Kabul on the main highway to the southern hub of Kandahar, a day after they took control of the second and third largest cities in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10350-internally-displaced-afghans-have-taken-shelter-in-capital-kabul-as-fight-101628945911389.html

That brought the total pandemic death toll to 97,208, and total confirmed cases to 4,389,085.Last week, Iran hit a record in both its single-day death toll and confirmed new cases of Covid-19, with 42,541 new coronavirus cases and a daily death toll of 588.Iran is struggling to vaccinate its people against the pandemic. Like much of the world, it remains far behind countries like the United States in vaccinations, with only 3.8 million of its more than 80 million people having received both vaccine doses.Many front-line medical workers have been vaccinated with Iran's locally produced shots, or the Chinese state-backed Sinopharm vaccine that may be less effective than other inoculations.Iran's government announced that its homemade vaccine provides 85% protection from the coronavirus, without disclosing data or details. Iran also imports Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, as well as the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot through the United Nations-backed COVAX program.So far, authorities have avoided imposing heavy-handed rules on a population badly equipped to bear them. Iran, which has suffered the worst virus outbreak in the region, is reeling from a series of crises: tough US sanctions, global isolation, a heat wave, the worst blackouts in recent memory and ongoing protests over water and electricity shortages.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, in January slammed shut any possibility of American or British vaccines entering the country, calling them “forbidden.”For now, the majority of Iranians receiving vaccines rely on foreign-made shots. A health ministry spokesman said that Iran could import Western vaccines “as long as they're not produced in the US or Britain.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-will-impose-6-day-general-lockdown-over-coronavirus-101628942653012.html
14-08-2021||World||'Pakistan is complicit': US Congressman calls for sanction as Taliban advance||Amid accusations against Pakistan of covertly assisting the Afghan Taliban, a US Congressman has urged President Joe Biden to impose sanctions on Islamabad unless they "change course." In a letter to Biden, House Representative Mike Waltz said that Pakistan's military strategy is dictating the Taliban."At the least, Pakistan is complicit with Taliban advance and is choosing not to coordinate with the ANSF. At worst, the Pakistani military and intelligence services may be directly aiding the Taliban offensive," Waltz said, urging the Biden administration to cut off all aid to Pakistan."Additionally, I ask that your administration also consider sanctioning Pakistan unless they change course and make greater efforts to prevent the Taliban from using their border region to regroup between firefights," he added.The Republican lawmaker raised concerns about the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, urging the US president to reverse course and provide military resources to assist the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). He opined that Taliban forces are exposed on the ground as they were in 2001 and US air support can blunt the offensive.“Air support will give the Government of Afghanistan and ANSF time to regroup and turn the tide of battle. They are doing the fighting and dying on the ground, but American air support will bolster their resolve and change the battlefield psychology,” Waltz said.He expressed bafflement at the recent statements made by theUS special envoy in Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad, author of the Doha agreement. Highlighting the reports of abuses against women, Waltz said that Khalilzad has provided the president with poor counsel and “his diplomatic strategy has failed spectacularly.”“Ambassador Khalilzad has convinced multiple administrations that the Taliban is interested in governing and peace. It is clear that the Taliban is only interested in brutality and power. In light of this catastrophe, Ambassador Khalilzad should resign immediately or be relieved from his position,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-is-complicit-us-congressman-calls-for-sanction-as-taliban-advances-101628938820794.html

According to a report by the Associated Press, a schoolteacher from Takhar province in northern Afghanistan said that after Taliban capture, women were not allowed to go out to the market without a male escort.Girls riding home in a motorised rickshaw in the Takhar province were stopped and lashed for wearing "revealing sandals", the report said quoting families who have left their homeland and now took refuge in Kabul -- on the sidewalk, in the park.Those who saw Taliban rule before 2001, for them these diktats bring a flashback of that harrowing time when women were not allowed to study and work. The Taliban also carried out public executions, chopped off the hands of thieves and stoned women accused of adultery.The Taliban now control more than two-thirds of the country, including Herat and Kandahar, the two of the largest cities of the country. According to reports, it is now just a matter of time that Kabul will also be captured by the Taliban, though Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Saturday said that he was remobilising the armed forces.United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday said horrific reports of Taliban oppression on Afghan women and girls have emerged from areas that have already been seized. "I'm... deeply disturbed by early indications that the Taliban are imposing severe restrictions on human rights in the areas under their control, particularly targeting women and journalists," Guterres told reporters.Associated Press interviewed Zahra (name changed) who has been working from home but after the Taliban took over Herat, she is not being able to work and she does not know when she will be able to work again. She is apprehensive that she won't be able to play the guitar, her brother won't be able to play football. And the women community of the country, which even reached the parliament in the last 20 years, will again be pushed back to the wall.Zarmina Kakar, a women's rights activist in Kabul,was a year old when the Taliban entered Kabul for the first time in 1996. Her mother took her out to buy her ice cream and was whipped by a Taliban fighter for revealing her face for a couple of minutes. “Today again, I feel that if Taliban come to power, we will return back to the same dark days,” she said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-revealing-slipper-women-not-allowed-to-go-out-alone-talibani-diktat-101628937430499.html

"Therefore, I have started extensive consultations inside the government with the elders, political leaders, representatives of people, and international partners on achieving a reasonable and certain political solution in which the peace and stability of the people of Afghanistan are envisaged." AFP said quoting Ghani.The insurgent Taliban have captured much of northern, western, and southern Afghanistan at a breakneck pace, alarming the US, which now projects the fall of the final frontier of the Afghan government, Kabul, within 90 days.

She said the Taliban have reached the Char Asyab district, just 11 kilometers (7 miles) south of the capital, Kabul.The Taliban also attacked the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif from several directions, setting off heavy fighting on its outskirts, according to Munir Ahmad Farhad, a spokesman for the provincial governor. There was no immediate word on casualties.Afghan President Ashraf Ghani had flown to Mazar-e-Sharif on Wednesday to rally the city's defenses, meeting with several militia commanders, including Abdul Rashid Dostum and Ata Mohammad Noor, who command thousands of fighters.They remain allied with the government, but during previous rounds of fighting in Afghanistan, warlords have been known to switch sides for their own survival. Ismail Khan, a powerful former warlord who had tried to defend Herat, was captured by the Taliban when the insurgents seized the western city after two weeks of heavy fighting.Residents of Mazar-e-Sharif expressed fear about the security breakdown.“The situation is dangerous outside of the city and inside the city," Mohibullah Khan said, adding that many residents are also struggling economically.“The security situation in the city is getting worse," said Kawa Basharat. "I want peace and stability. The fighting should be stopped.”The Taliban have made major advances in recent days, including capturing Herat and Kandahar, the country's second and third-largest cities. They now control 18 of Afghanistan's 34 provinces, leaving the Western-backed government in control of a smattering of provinces in the center and east, as well as Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif.The withdrawal of foreign forces and the swift retreat of Afghanistan's own troops — despite hundreds of billions of dollars in U.S. aid over the years — has raised fears the Taliban could return to power or the country could be shattered by factional fighting, as it was after the Soviet withdrawal in 1989.The first Marines from a contingent of 3,000 arrived on Friday to help partially evacuate the U.S. Embassy. The rest are set to arrive by Sunday, and their deployment has raised questions about whether the administration will meet its Aug. 31 withdrawal deadline.The Taliban meanwhile released a video announcing the takeover of the main radio station in the southern city of Kandahar, renaming it the Voice of Sharia, or Islamic law.In the video, an unnamed insurgent said all employees were present and would broadcast news, political analysis, and recitations of the Quran, the Islamic holy book. It appears the station will no longer play music.It was not clear if the Taliban had purged the previous employees or allowed them to return to work. Most residents of Kandahar sport the traditional dress favored by the Taliban. The man in the video congratulated the people of Kandahar on the Taliban's victory.The Taliban have used mobile radio stations over the years, but have not operated a station inside a major city since they ruled the country from 1996-2001. At that time, they also ran a station called Voice of Sharia out of Kandahar, the birthplace of the militant group. Music was banned.The U.S. invaded shortly after the 9/11 attacks, which al-Qaida planned and carried out while being sheltered by theTaliban. After rapidly ousting the Taliban, the U.S. shifted toward nation-building, hoping to create a modern Afghan state after decades of war and unrest.Earlier this year, President Joe Biden announced a timeline for the withdrawal of all U.S. troops by the end of August, pledging to end America's longest war. His predecessor, President Donald Trump, had reached an agreement with the Taliban to pave the way for a U.S. pullout.Biden's announcement set the latest offensive in motion. The Taliban, who have long controlled large parts of the Afghan countryside, moved quickly to seize provincial capitals, border crossings, and other key infrastructure.Tens of thousands of Afghans have fled their homes, with many fearing a return to the Taliban's oppressive rule. The group had previously governed Afghanistan under a harsh version of Islamic law in which women were largely confined to the home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-seizes-logar-province-near-kabul-launch-attack-on-mazaresharif-101628929851255.html

Two-thirds of the country also already overrun by the Sunni Pashtun fighters who have surrounded Kabul in the wake of the withdrawal of American and Nato soldiers.Also Read: Taliban set hard conditions for peace talks with Afghan govtThe US embassy in the capital city is scrambling to destroy its classified documents and evacuate American citizens. In an internal memo, as reported by CNN, the embassy has asked its staff for the disposal of the American flag or items that could be used for propaganda.The notice, which according to CNN, is titled "Emergency Destruction Services", describes the fire situation on the ground as more and more cities fall to Taliban. The notice further said that destruction support will be provided daily to ensure all the sensitive material is destroyed. It has called for using various methods, like burn bins, a disintegrator and an incinerator, according to CNN.Back in Washington, the US State Department has begun preparing for a crisis, calling on volunteers with "High Threat, High Risk" and overseas experience for supporting US Embassy in Kabul, The Washington Post reported.Painting a grim picture of things to come in Afghanistan, one State Department official who works on security issues said that "the whole thing is about to go bad", it further said.Meanwhile, the Taliban on Saturday launched a fresh assault to capture the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif, the fourth-largest in Afghanistan. It is the capital of Balkh province and is defended by powerful former warlords.The Taliban have captured most of northern, western and southern Afghanistan in recent weeks, leaving the Western-backed government in control of a smattering of provinces in the center and east, as well as the capital, Kabul.The withdrawal of foreign forces and the swift retreat of Afghanistan's own troops has raised fears the Taliban could return to power or the country could be plunged into civil war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-at-kabul-s-doorstep-us-embassy-asks-staff-to-wipe-sensitive-documents-101628926006658.html
14-08-2021||World||Independence Day 2021: Why Pakistan celebrates freedom a day before India||Pakistan is celebrating its 75th Independence Day on Saturday, a day before India, too, marks its 74th year of freedom. However, the Indian Independence Act, 1947, gave birth to two sovereign countries, India and Pakistan, on August 15 that year. Then, why is it that Pakistan observes its Independence Day on August 14, and not on August 15?Over the years, multiple theories have been floated to answer the said question. Some of those are as follows:(1.) Lord Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of British India and the first Governor-General of the Dominion of India, transferred the power of governance of Pakistan to its founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, in Karachi on August 14, 1947. Though Mountbatten mentioned August 15 as the date on which India and Pakistan would become independent nations, Pakistan adopted August 14 as its Independence Day as the transfer of power took place on that date.(2.) In June 1948, at a cabinet meeting chaired by Liaquat Ali Khan, the first Prime Minister of Pakistan, it was proposed that the country celebrate its Independence Day before India. The proposal was taken to Jinnah for his approval and the date was advanced to August 14.(3.) Religion is also cited as one of the reasons. It is argued that the intervening night of August 14 and 15, 1947, coincided with the 27th day of Ramadan, which is regarded as an auspicious day of the holy month. Hence, August 14 was taken as the day of independence.(4.) Indian Standard Time (IST) being 30 minutes ahead of the Pakistan Standard Time (PST) is also cited as a reason. Since India became a free country at 00:00 hours on August 15, the local time in Pakistan was 11:30pm on August 14, and hence the latter celebrates its independence on this date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/independence-day-2021-why-pakistan-celebrates-freedom-a-day-before-india-101628920124972.html
14-08-2021||World||Taliban set hard conditions for peace talks with Afghan govt||With global pressure mounting on Islamabad to push the marauding Taliban to the peace table, Rawalpindi has suggested a meeting between Afghan government leadership apart from President Ashraf Ghani and the Quetta Shura leaders in Pakistan to negotiate a power sharing settlement largely in favour of Sunni Pashtun Islamists.The earlier attempt brokered by Pakistani deep state to hold a meeting between President Ashraf Ghani and Taliban leaders, Mullah Yaqoob and Sirajuddin Haqqani, between July 17-19 failed as the Islamist leaders have no desire to talk to the current head of Afghan government. The July initiative was the brainchild of US Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad and UK Army Chief Nick Carter and the meetings with Taliban leadership were to take under the garb of a state visit of Ashraf Ghani to Pakistan. While Taliban’s ideological leader Haibatullah Akhunzada is based in Karachi, both Yaqoob and Haqqani are handling military operations of the Sunni group from Quetta and Helmand.With Taliban not willing to negotiate with President Ashraf Ghani, name of Prince Mirwais Khan, son of former King Zahir and Chairman of National Committee for Preservation of Afghan Cultural Heritage, is being floated around as a possible interlocutor for the Afghan government. Prince Mirwais is a scholar with western education and lives in Afghanistan. As of now no dates or names of interlocuter on behalf of the Afghan government have been decided.Although Taliban under pressure from ISI are willing to negotiate with Afghan government interlocutor in Pakistan, the conditions for peace forwarded by the Sunni group to Kabul are very steep. According to diplomats based in Kabul, Taliban this week has put forward three conditions to Afghanistan government for peace negotiations. They are:· All Taliban prisoners in Afghan jails should be unconditionally freed.· The Afghan government should use its good offices to get Taliban delisted as a terrorist group by the UN. Incidentally, the 1267 sanctions committee that designates individuals and entities as supporters of terrorism is headed by India.· The Taliban has proposed that President, Defence Minister, Interior Minister, Army Chief and NDS (spy agency) Chief should be from the insurgent group leaving the lame duck position of Prime Minister to the present regime in Kabul.While it is for the US and the Afghan government to decide the leader to replace Ashraf Ghani if it wants a peace settlement, the Taliban conditions appear to be humiliating to the present government as all the power will be in the hands of the Sunni Islamist force. But the present regime in Kabul has binary options left with the Taliban knocking on its door. Either it fights the Taliban and pushes it back or succumb to the peace demands of the Pak backed Islamist group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-sets-hard-conditions-for-peace-talks-with-afghan-govt-101628919740463.html

The cases have been spreading like "wildfire" among adults as well as children, they added.News agency Associated Press quoted the health officials as saying that the rapid acceleration in Covid-19 cases shows delta has the potential to unravel the state's hard-fought progress towards recovery.Even vaccination is not helping. “Vaccination progress is continuing, but not fast enough,” state Secretary of Health Umair A Shah said. “If you are unvaccinated and continue to have questions, we encourage you to speak to a trusted health care provider.”Pend Oreille, Douglas, Lincoln, Pacific, Chelan and Island counties of the Washington state are the worst affected, recording more than 600 per cent rise in Covid-19 cases in past one month.King County, Clallam, Stevens, Asotin, Whitman, Franklin, Spokane, Clark, Lewis and Pierce counties have also been ravaged by the virus.Texas and Florida are also experiencing some of the worst Covid-19 outbreaks in the United States, accounting for 40 per cent of hospitalisations over the last week, according to the White House. There too, the Delta variant has been the dominant strain which has been wreaking havoc.As you move South, healthcare workers in Georgia are also raising alarm with a surge in COvid-19 cases fuelled by the Delta variant.“I can’t comprehend why - after fighting this war for 18 months, with people still dying and with critically ill patients filling our COVID units - we’re still having to work to convince people of the seriousness of what our tireless teams are dealing with every day,” Phoebe Putney Health System President and CEO Scott Steiner said in a statement on Friday.Georgia’s case count continued to rise, with the seven-day rolling average climbing above 6,000 on Friday, the worst since February 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-causing-covid-19-cases-to-spread-like-wildfire-in-washington-101628918881118.html

14-08-2021||World||US warns 9/11 anniversary could inspire extremist attacks||The upcoming 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks as well as approaching religious holidays could inspire extremist attacks, the Department of Homeland Security said in a terrorism alert issued Friday.DHS did not cite any specific threats in the National Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin. But it noted that the US is in a “heightened threat environment," fuelled by factors that include violent extremists motivated by racial and ethnic hatred and resentment of restrictions imposed during the pandemic.DHS issues the warnings to alert the public as well as state and local authorities. They reflect intelligence gathered from other law enforcement agencies.The bulletin is an extension of a similar one issued in May that expired on the day the new one was issued. DHS says domestic extremists remain a national threat priority for US law enforcement and will for at least the remainder of the year.The agency noted that al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula recently released the first English-language edition of its Inspire magazine in four years, apparently to mark the upcoming anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.The anniversary and the approaching holidays “could serve as a catalyst for acts of targeted violence,” it said.DHS also noted that domestic extremists motivated by religious and ethnic hatred have in the past attacked houses of worships and other gatherings, but it said there aren't any “credible or imminent threats identified to these locations.”As in previous bulletins, DHS expressed concern about both domestic extremists, motivated by “personal grievances and extremist ideological beliefs,” and foreign influences.The agency said Russian, Chinese and Iranian government-linked media outlets have helped spread conspiracy theories about the origins of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of vaccines and have in some cases amplified calls for violence against people of Asian descent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-warns-9-11-anniversary-could-inspire-extremist-attacks-101628908838015.html

14-08-2021||World||Kandahar falls, Taliban on way to Kabul’s gates||The Taliban completed their sweep of the country’s south on Friday as they took four more provincial capitals in a lightning offensive that is gradually encircling Kabul, just weeks before the US is set to officially end its two-decade war.In just the last 24 hours, the country’s second- and third-largest cities — Herat in the west and Kandahar in the south — have fallen as has the capital of the southern Helmand province, where American, British and NATO forces fought some of the bloodiest battles of the conflict.The blitz through the Taliban’s southern heartland means the insurgents now hold half of Afghanistan’s 34 provincial capitals and control more than two-thirds of the country.The Western-backed government in the capital, Kabul, still holds a smattering of provinces in the centre and east, as well as the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif.While Kabul isn’t directly under threat yet, the resurgent Taliban were battling government forces in Logar province, some 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the capital. The US military has estimated that Kabul could come under insurgent pressure within 30 days and that the Taliban could overrun the rest of the country within a few months. They have already taken over much of the north and west of the country.The blitz pushed the US to rush 3,000 fresh troops in a temporary deployment to speed evacuation flights for some American diplomats and thousands of Afghans. The Pentagon also was moving another 4,500 to 5,000 troops to bases in the Gulf countries of Qatar and Kuwait, including 1,000 to Qatar to speed up visa processing for Afghan translators and others who fear retribution from the Taliban for their past work with Americans, and their family members.India, Germany, Qatar, Turkey and several other nations have reaffirmed to not recognise any government in Afghanistan that is imposed through the use of military force and called for an immediate end to violence and attacks in the war-torn country.A statement issued by Qatar on Friday following two separate meetings on Afghanistan in Doha said the participating countries agreed that the Afghan peace process needs to be accelerated as a matter of “great urgency”.In the south of Afghanistan, the insurgents swept through the three provincial capitals on Friday.Attaullah Afghan, the head of the provincial council in Helmand, said that the Taliban captured Lashkar Gah following weeks of heavy fighting and raised their white flag over governmental buildings. He said that three national army bases outside of the city remain under control of the government.Atta Jan Haqbayan, the provincial council chief in Zabul province, said the local capital of Qalat fell and that officials were in a nearby army camp preparing to leave. Bismillah Jan Mohammad and Qudratullah Rahimi, lawmakers from Uruzgan province, said local officials surrendered Tirin Kot. Taliban fighters paraded through a main square there, driving a Humvee and a pickup seized from Afghan security forces.Danish broadcaster TV2, meanwhile, quoted foreign minister Jeppe Kofod as saying that the country’s embassy in Kabul is closing temporarily and staff are being evacuated. Germany is reducing its embassy staff in Kabul to “the operationally necessary, absolute minimum,” foreign minister Heiko Maas told reporters Friday, as he urged all German citizens to leave the country immediately.Thousands of Afghans have fled their homes amid fears the Taliban will return the country to the sort of brutal, repressive rule it imposed when it was last in power at the turn of the millennium. At that time, the group all but eliminated women’s rights and conducted public executions as it imposed an unsparing version of Islamic law.An early sign of such tactics came in Herat, where insurgents paraded two alleged looters through the streets on Friday with black makeup smeared on their faces.There are also concerns that the fighting could plunge the country into civil war, which is what happened after the Soviets withdrew in 1989. Peace talks in Qatar between the Taliban and the government remain stalled, though diplomats are still meeting, as the US, European and Asian nations warned that battlefield gains would not lead to political recognition.“We demand an immediate end to attacks against cities, urge a political settlement, and warn that a government imposed by force will be a pariah state,” said Zalmay Khalilzad, the US envoy to the talks.But the Taliban advance continued.The onslaught represents a stunning collapse of Afghan forces after the United States spent nearly two decades and $830 billion trying to establish a functioning state. US forces toppled the Taliban in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, which al-Qaida planned and executed while being sheltered by the Taliban government. The fighters now advancing across the country ride on American-made Humvees and carry M-16s pilfered from Afghan forces.Bill Roggio, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the Afghan army has rotted from within due to corruption and mismanagement, leaving troops in the field poorly equipped and with little motivation to fight. The Taliban, meanwhile, have spent a decade taking control of large swaths of the countryside. That allowed them to rapidly seize key infrastructure and urban areas once President Joe Biden announced the timeline for the US withdrawal, saying he was determined to end America’s longest war.“Whatever forces are left or remaining that are in the Kabul area and the provinces around them, they’re going to be used for the defense of Kabul,” Roggio said. “Unless something dramatically changes, and I don’t see how that’s possible, these provinces (that have fallen) will remain under Taliban control.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kandahar-falls-taliban-on-way-to-kabul-s-gates-101628905938619.html
14-08-2021||World||Canadian PM Trudeau likely to hold snap polls to win majority||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appears set to take the risk of holding snap elections to secure a majority in the House of Commons despite health authorities formally declaring that a fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is now under way.According to multiple news outlets, Trudeau is expected to meet governor-general Mary Simon on Sunday for starting the election process, formally called dropping of the writ, and snap polls will be held on September 20.This was first reported by Reuters and the French-language outlet La Presse and confirmed by others. The Hindustan Times has also confirmed this likelihood.The Trudeau-led Liberal Party government is in a minority in the House of Commons, with 155 MPs, as against 119 for the principal Opposition party, the Conservatives.When the last federal elections were held in October 2019, the Liberals captured 157 seats, short of the 170 majority mark and also trailed the Conservatives in vote share, with 31.1% against 34.3%.However, most polls have suggested the Liberals have a lead now, with the latest from the non-profit Angus Reid Institute putting them at 36% support, five points ahead of the Conservatives.But it stated, “As members of the fifth estate speculate about the exact date the prime minister is expected to call a general election, Canadians are more occupied by fears of a fourth wave of Covid-19 than politics.”In fact, 52% of respondents fear contracting the coronavirus, a five-point increase over the figure for July.Their fears will not be assuaged by the statement on Thursday from Canada’s chief public health officer Theresa Tam, who told reporters during a briefing, “We have been closely monitoring increases in Covid-19 activity across the country.“The latest national surveillance data indicate that a fourth wave is under way in Canada and that cases are plotting along a strong resurgence trajectory.”She also said there were more than 13,000 active cases in the country, more than double the figure for late July.When questioned about the possible election, Tam demurred and said, “It’s not my role to advise on whether there should be an election or not.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-pm-trudeau-likely-to-hold-snap-polls-to-win-majority-101628905223907.html

But China rejects the politicisation of the probe, Chinese state media quoted Ma as saying.US: FDA gives nod to extra dose of vaccineThe US on Thursday authorised an extra dose of Covid vaccine for people with weakened immune systems, as the country struggles to thwart the Delta variant. Emergency use authorisation for a third injection of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines was granted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulator. “The country has entered yet another wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the FDA is especially cognisant that immunocompromised people are particularly at risk for severe disease,” said acting FDA commissioner Janet Woodcock.Israel expands campaign for booster shotsIsrael on Friday lowered to 50 from 60 the minimum age of eligibility for a Covid-19 vaccine booster shot and will also offer them to health workers, hoping to stem a surge in Delta variant infections. The director-general of Israel’s health ministry, Nachman Ash, accepted a recommendation late on Thursday by an expert advisory panel to expand third shot eligibility of the Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine.Those eligible will be “people over 50, health care workers, people with severe risk factors for the coronavirus, prisoners and wardens”.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-shoots-down-2nd-who-probe-into-covid-virus-origin-101628905013889.html

As the security situation worsens, the Afghan people are leaving their homes to reach relatively safer places.The Canadian minister of immigration, refugees, and citizenship said that the country is expeditiously carrying out special resettlement operations to evacuate Afghan nationals who provided critical support to the Canadian mission. The recent expansion to the immigration programme is an addition to the earlier initiative undertaken by the country to welcome the thousands of Afghans who worked for the Canadian government, such as interpreters, embassy workers, and their families.“Many more Afghan lives are now under increasing threat and many have already fled,” the minister added. He, however, did not provide a timetable for the resettlement programme.Canada's defence minister Harjit Sajjan also said that the country has signed an MoU with the Manmeet Singh Bhullar foundation to resettle a group of vulnerable Afghan Sikh and Hindu families out of Afghanistan. “Over the next several months, we will expand this programme to resettle several hundred remaining Sikhs and Hindus,” the minister said.Also Read | How will India ensure safety of Afghan Hindus, Sikhs from Taliban violence?
