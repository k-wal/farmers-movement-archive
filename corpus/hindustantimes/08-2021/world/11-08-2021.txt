He said the administration was pressuring OPEC and producers allied with the cartel to more quickly undo the production cuts put in place at the start of the pandemic.“The production cuts made during the pandemic should be reversed as the global economy recovers in order to lower prices for consumers," Biden said Wednesday.Biden's National Economic Council director, Brian Deese, asked the FTC head, Lina Khan, to “monitor the US gasoline market and address any illegal conduct that might be contributing to price increases for consumers at the pump.” The FTC is an independent agency and may take advice, but not direction, from the White House.Wednesday’s report from the Labor Department showed that consumer prices jumped 0.5% from June to July, down from the previous monthly increase of 0.9%. They have increased a substantial 5.4% compared with a year earlier, erasing much of the benefit to workers from higher pay.Gas prices are up about a $1 from than a year ago as Americans hit peak summer driving season and return to roads after pandemic shut-ins. The White House says it's no cause for alarm, saying the country is “not at an historically high gas price moment" and that prices are roughly where they were in 2018, still Biden acknowledged they're high enough to “pinch” working families.“I want to make sure that nothing stands in the way of oil price declines leading to lower gas prices for consumers,” Biden added.Rising prices, both at the pump and across other consumer goods, have become a potent talking point among Biden's GOP critics. The White House has insisted that inflation will cool as the economy recovers from the twin shocks of the pandemic and the nation's ongoing recovery from the virus-induced lockdowns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-seeking-ways-to-address-rising-energy-prices-101628705104375.html
11-08-2021||World||Russia hits Kremlin critic Navalny with new charge that could add to jail term||Russian authorities announced a new criminal charge against Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny on Wednesday, the latest move in a crackdown ahead of September's parliamentary election that could add as much as three years to his prison term.Navalny, President Vladimir Putin's fiercest domestic critic, is serving a 2-1/2-year sentence for parole violations he calls trumped up. He was arrested after flying back from Germany where he had recovered from a nerve agent poisoning.The Investigative Committee, which probes serious crimes, said in a statement that Navalny had been charged with creating an organisation that "infringes on the personality and rights of citizens", a crime punishable by up to three years in jail.A jail term of that length could keep Navalny in custody past the next presidential election in 2024 when Putin's current six-year term in the Kremlin is due to end.The Investigative Committee said that Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation had incited Russians to break the law and take part in unauthorised protests demanding his release in January that authorities said were illegal.Navalny and his allies have faced pressure for years, but his political network was outlawed in June after a court formally labelled his anti-corruption foundation and regional campaign groups as extremist.Several of his closest allies have left the country for fear of prosecution, and his team has also disbanded their regional groups to protect activists.Allies who post on social media under the name Team Navalny described the accusation as "the latest meaningless charge"."No one infringes on the personality and rights of citizens like Putin himself and all his henchmen, including the Investigative Committee," they said on Telegram messenger.The charge comes a day after the Investigative Committee on Tuesday announced a new criminal investigation into two close Navalny allies, who are based abroad, for raising funds for his political network.On Sunday, Russian media outlets reported that Lyubov Sobol, a close Navalny associate, had left Russia and flown to Turkey. She has not commented on her whereabouts and her allies have declined to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-hits-kremlin-critic-navalny-with-new-charge-that-could-add-to-jail-term-101628703763649.html
11-08-2021||World||WHO to conduct international trials of these three drugs for Covid-19 treatment||The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday announced major international trials to test three new drugs in hospitalised coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients. Under the next phase of the Solidarity trial, called Solidarity PLUS, artesunate, imatinib and infliximab will be tested on thousands of volunteer patients in more than 600 hospitals in 52 countries, 16 more countries than the first phase of trials.“Finding more effective and accessible therapeutics for Covid-19 patients remains a critical need, and WHO is proud to lead this global effort,” WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press briefing.The largest global collaboration among WHO member states allows the trial to assess multiple treatments using a single protocol, according to the UN health agency. Through the expansive programme, new treatments could be added and ineffective treatment could be dropped throughout the course of the trial. In the first phase, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and interferon were evaluated for the treatment of hospitalised Covid-19 patients but the results showed the four drugs had little or no effect.“I would like to thank the participating governments, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, clinicians and patients, who have come together to do this in true global solidarity,” said Tedros.The three drugs to be tested under Solidarity PLUS are already used for other diseases.Artesunate is used to treat malaria. During the trial, the intravenous drug will be administered for seven days, using the standard dose recommended for the treatment of severe malaria. According to WHO, artemisinin and its derivatives have been extensively used in the treatment of malaria and other parasitic diseases for over 30 years.Imatinib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat certain cancers. The drug will be administered orally once everyday for 14 days.Johnson and Johnson’s infliximab, a TNF alpha inhibitor, is used to treat diseases of the immune system. The intravenous drug will be administered during the trial as a single dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-to-conduct-international-trials-of-these-three-drugs-for-covid-19-treatment-101628703274280.html
11-08-2021||World||US CDC urges Covid-19 vaccines during pregnancy as Delta surges||The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged all pregnant women Wednesday to get the Covid-19 vaccine as hospitals in hot spots around the U.S. see disturbing numbers of unvaccinated mothers-to-be seriously ill with the virus.Expectant women run a higher higher risk of severe illness and pregnancy complications from the coronavirus, including perhaps miscarriages and stillbirths. But their vaccination rates are low, with only about 23% having received at least one dose, according to CDC data.‘’The vaccines are safe and effective, and it has never been more urgent to increase vaccinations as we face the highly transmissible delta variant and see severe outcomes from Covid-19 among unvaccinated pregnant people,’’ CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a statement.The updated guidance comes after a CDC analysis of new safety data on 2,500 women showed no increased risks of miscarriage for those who received at least one dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine before 20 weeks of pregnancy. The analysis found a miscarriage rate of around 13%, within the normal range.The CDC’s advice echoes recent recommendations from top obstetrician groups. The agency had previously encouraged pregnant women to consider vaccination but had stopped short of a full recommendation. The new advice also applies to nursing mothers and women planning to get pregnant.Although pregnant women were not included in studies that led to authorization of Covid-19 vaccines, experts say real-world experience in tens of thousands of women shows that the shots are safe for them and that when given during pregnancy may offer some protection to newborns.The new guidance comes amid a surge in Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S., driven by the highly contagious delta variant.Some health authorities believe the variant may cause more severe disease — in pregnant women and others as well — than earlier versions of the virus, though that is still under investigation.National figures show the latest surge in cases among pregnant women is lower than it was during the outbreak's winter peak. But at some hospitals in states with low vaccination rates, the numbers of sick mothers-to-be outpace those during earlier surges, before vaccines were available.“This is by far the worst we’ve seen in the pandemic,’’ said Dr. Jane Martin, an obstetrician with Ochsner Baptist Medical Center in New Orleans. She added: “It’s disheartening and it’s exhausting. It feels like it doesn’t have to be like this.”At the beginning of the pandemic and with each surge, Ochsner had a few pregnant patients very sick with the virus, though the numbers had dwindled in recent months.“A week or two ago that pace changed drastically,’’ Martin said. “We have had multiple critically ill pregnant patients admitted’’ every day, most requiring intensive care.Martin said she has taken care of at least 30 pregnant patients hospitalized with Covid-19 over the last two weeks. Most were unvaccinated.Experts say the lifting of mask rules and other social distancing precautions and the rise of the delta variant have contributed to the worrisome trend. But also, vaccinations weren’t made available to women of childbearing age and others under 65 until spring.Early in her pregnancy, Tennessee kindergarten teacher Sara Brown decided she would wait until the baby was born to get the shots. There wasn’t much safety data yet about getting vaccinated during pregnancy, and at 36, she was young, healthy and “figured if I did get it, it would probably just be a bad cold.’’But what seemed like a sinus infection in June turned into severe Covid-19, landing her in a Nashville intensive care unit for five days, on oxygen and struggling to breathe.Her daughter Suzie was born healthy on Aug. 2. But it was a harrowing experience.“Not being able to catch your breath is such a panicky feeling, knowing I had life inside me that could be suffering too,’’ she said.At Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where Brown was treated, there were no infected pregnant patients early in July. Now the hospital is admitting four to five a week, all unvaccinated, said obstetrician Dr. Jennifer Thompson. About 20% of those patients are being treated in the intensive care unit, compared with 11% during previous surges, she said.For some pregnant patients critically ill with Covid-19, organs begin to fail and doctors induce labor early or deliver babies by cesarean section as a last resort, said Dr. Jeannie Kelly, an obstetrician at Washington University Medical Center in St. Louis.About 20% of all patients admitted for labor and delivery last week at the St. Louis hospital are infected, more than double the rate during the Covid-19 surge in Missouri last year, she said. About one-third of these women are critically ill.Around 105,000 pregnant U.S. women have been infected with Covid-19, and almost 18,000 have been hospitalized, according to the CDC. About one-fourth of those received intensive care and 124 died.Pregnancy-related changes in body functions may explain why the virus can be dangerous for mothers-to-be. These include reduced lung capacity and adjustments in the disease-fighting immune system that protect and help the fetus grow.The risks are disproportionately high for Black and Hispanic women, who are more likely to face health care and economic inequalities that increase their chances of getting sick.Some studies suggest the virus can also increase the risks of preterm birth and stillbirth, and in rare cases, it appears to have passed from mother to fetus.Martin, the New Orleans obstetrician, noted that local hospitals are also treating increasing numbers of children and babies sick with Covid-19, some of whom may have been infected after birth by unvaccinated mothers.Martin was pregnant when she got her own shots last winter. She delivered a healthy baby girl a week after the last shot.“Vaccinating people is the only way out,’’ she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cdc-urges-covid-19-vaccines-during-pregnancy-as-delta-surges-101628699496968.html
11-08-2021||World||Explained: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's legal woes far from over||Here is an overview of the civil lawsuits and criminal investigations likely to face New York Governor Andrew Cuomo for months to come as he returns to private life following his resignation on Tuesday over a sexual harassment scandal.Has Cuomo been charged with any crimes?No. He is under criminal investigation.Prosecutors in Manhattan, Nassau County, Albany County, Westchester County and Oswego County have requested evidence from an independent inquiry launched by New York Attorney General Letitia James while looking into the matter.These local prosecutors, known as district attorneys, would be the ones to bring any criminal charges.The report for James found he groped, kissed or made suggestive comments to women including government workers past and present - one a state trooper - and retaliated against at least one woman who accused him of sexual misconduct.Cuomo has denied wrongdoing. He said he accepted "full responsibility" for what he characterized as ill-conceived attempts to be affectionate or humorous but said he would resign in two weeks for the good of the state.Cuomo's lawyer Rita Glavin has said James's probe, which was civil in nature, “was conducted to support a predetermined narrative” and “left material out.”One of Cuomo's accusers, Brittany Commisso, last week filed a complaint with police in Albany, alleging the governor groped her breast at the Executive Mansion last November.Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple said at a news conference that his office would conduct a thorough investigation.What crimes could prosecutors be considering?Apple said Commisso's complaint alleging Cuomo groped her could lead to misdemeanor charges.The two most applicable crimes under New York law would be "forcible touching" and "sexual abuse in the third degree," said Julie Rendelman, a criminal defense attorney and former Brooklyn prosecutor.Forcible touching, the more serious of the two misdemeanors, can lead to a maximum sentence of one year in jail, but Rendelman said a prison sentence was "very unlikely" for any defendant who had not previously been charged with a crime.Does Cuomo's stature more or less likely to be charged?Ross Garber, a lawyer who focuses on political investigations, said Cuomo's resignation could take some public pressure off New York prosecutors to charge him."Given the variety of criminal probes, the divergent issues, and various jurisdictions, it’s impossible to say with certainty" whether Cuomo will be charged, Garber said. "But resignation does take a bit of oxygen out of the wildfire that has been building for consequences for Cuomo’s actions."Are there obstacles to a criminal case?In criminal cases, the prosecution must establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.Deborah Tuerkheimer, a Northwestern University law professor and former prosecutor, said Cuomo's accusers may be reluctant to put themselves through the emotional turmoil of a criminal trial if he is only charged with misdemeanors."It's really difficult to testify in a criminal trial," Tuerkheimer said.Judith Olin, a University at Buffalo law professor and a former New York state prosecutor who specialized in sexual assault cases, said any prosecution could face an uphill climb given the lack of physical evidence and witnesses.What about civil lawsuits?A lawyer for Lindsey Boylan, a former aide who was the first woman to accuse Cuomo publicly last December, has said she plans to file a lawsuit against Cuomo. Other accusers could follow her lead, Rendelman said.A landmark federal law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibits sex discrimination, which includes sexual harassment, in the workplace.Cuomo accusers who invoke this law would be suing the state of New York - their employer - rather than Cuomo directly, said Ann Juliano, a Villanova University law professor.Under New York law, sexual harassment includes unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature - from sexual jokes to unwanted flirtation - that creates an offensive work environment, regardless of intent.Juliano said Cuomo's accusers could rely on a landmark New York law, championed by Cuomo in 2019, that made it easier for sexual harassment victims to prove their cases in court. Alleged victims no longer have to meet the high bar of proving sexual harassment is "severe and pervasive."To prevail in a civil lawsuit, Cuomo's accusers would only need to convince jurors that there was a greater than 50% chance that their allegations were true.What other legal problems does Cuomo face?Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn are investigating whether, as governor, Cuomo deliberately played down the number of deaths in nursing homes related to COVID-19.New York health officials released a report in July denying that their policies had caused any increase in deaths.James, the attorney general, has also been investigating whether Cuomo misused state resources to write and promote a book he published last October about his leadership during the early months of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-new-york-governor-andrew-cuomo-s-legal-woes-far-from-over-101628696974961.html

WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press briefing Wednesday that though Marburg, a deadly cousin of Ebola, is a very different virus from Sars-CoV-2, many of the elements of the response are the same, including isolation, tracing, and quarantining their contacts.“WHO and our partners are supporting Guinea’s ministry of health to investigate the source of the outbreak, trace contacts, and inform the local community about how to protect themselves,” Tedros said in his opening remarks.On Friday, Guinea informed the UN health agency of a case of Marburg virus disease in the country’s southwest. The patient, also the first known case of Marburg in West Africa, died 8 days after the onset of symptoms. The highly dangerous pathogen causes haemorrhagic fever and, according to past outbreaks, the average fatality rate is 50 per cent.“There is no licensed vaccine for Marburg, although there are vaccines under development, and WHO is working with our partners to seek opportunities to assess them during this outbreak through the R&D Blueprint for Epidemics,” Tedros added.Also Read | Guinea confirms first case of Marburg disease: All you need to knowThe natural reservoir of the Marburg virus is the African fruit bat. The virus takes its name from the German city of Marburg where it was first identified in 1967. The outbreak was associated with a laboratory where workers had been in contact with African green monkeys imported from Uganda.According to the WHO, the incubation period for Marburg virus disease varies from 2 to 21 days. The symptoms include high fever, severe headaches, muscular pain, vomiting and diarrhoea, which makes Marburg difficult to diagnose initially as they are similar to typhoid and malaria.“Haemorrhagic episodes typically follow between five and seven days later, with blood in the vomit and faeces and bleeding from the nose, gums and vagina. In fatal cases, death occurs most often between eight and nine days,” the WHO says on its website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-150-contacts-of-marburg-virus-case-ebola-s-deadly-cousin-identified-who-101628695403878.html

They are concentrating all their efforts to capture Mazar-e-Sharif, a bustling city in the north and the capital of Balkh province.Some politicians in Balkh province have established a new mobilisation council in the province to protect the city. This council consists of officials and representatives of the parties and has elected former Balkh Governor Atta Mohammad Noor as its chairman. India has already evacuated its staff from Mazar-e-Sharif in the wake of raging fighting.President Ashraf Ghani flew to Mazar-e-Sharif on Wednesday to rally old warlords to the defence of the biggest city in the north. Ghani convened a meeting, which was attended by top leaders including Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum and Atta Mohammad Noor. The leaders discussed the security situation in the north and chalked out the plan to defend Mazar-e-Sharif from Taliban.With US and NATO forces announcing withdrawal from the country, the Taliban have intensified their assault on major cities and seized control of Sar-e-Pul, Sheberghan, Aybak, Kunduz, Taluqan, Pul-e-Khumri, Farah, Zaranj.The loss of Faizabad, the capital city of Badakhshan, on Wednesday was the latest setback for the Afghan government, which has been struggling to stem the momentum of Taliban.Faizabad is the eighth provincial capital to fall since last week. According to local reports, 65 per cent of Afghanistan's territory is already under the control of the Sunni Pashtun insurgent group.The Afghan defence ministry said on Wednesday that 439 Taliban terrorists were killed and 77 injured in different operations carried out by the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF) across Afghan provinces in the past 24 hours. The neutralised terrorists also included four terrorists of Pakistani origin.As Taliban fighters continue to overrun swathes of land in Afghanistan, more and more cases of human rights violations are being reported. Afghan minister of justice Fazil Ahmad Manawi said that the country’s children are being forcefully taken by Taliban across the Durand Line into Pakistan where they are being trained in terrorism in the name of Islamic education. The Afghan Minister stated that children aged 13 and 14 were often taken to remote areas and districts of Afghanistan by so-called ‘religious scholars’ with deceptive Islamic teachings and sent to Balochistan.Voices of condemnation are coming from various quarters, particularly from Afghan residents who are demanding the global community to free the country from the scourge of Taliban. Among them is Afghan cricketer Rashid Khan who urged world leaders through a tweet on Tuesday that thousands of families have been displaced. “Don’t leave us in chaos. Stop killing Afghans and destroying Afghanistan.”Afghan human rights watchdog Women’s United Voice Advisory Group on Peace Policy said that the Taliban’s action of forceful marriages , which it termed as “jihad marriage”, should be documented worldwide and the group’s crimes against women should be documented in cooperation with human rights organizations.Afghanistan’s acting minister of finance Khalid Payenda stepped down on Tuesday and left Kabul for the US. however, local media reports said Payenda was fired by President Ashraf Ghani due to his incompetence and lack of achievement.China, meanwhile, has said that it is ready to play a ‘constructive role’ in facilitating negotiations through various channels to promote peaceful settlement of the Afghan issue. In an interview with China Central Television (CCTV), China’s special envoy for Afghan affairs, Yue Xiaoyong, said, “China will make unremitting efforts with the international community, neighboring countries and countries in the region."A multilateral meeting on Afghan peace process was held in Doha on Tuesday, in which special envoys on Afghanistan and interlocutors called parties for a political settlement to achieve enduring peace in the county. Representatives from China, the US, the UK, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, the United Nations, and the European Union participated in the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-president-ashraf-ghani-in-balkh-amid-taliban-offensive-for-mazaresharif-101628692546511.html

In a video shared by the UN health agency, a senior WHO official said that a lot of travel can be managed safely if countries gradually ease the curbs. Several countries have resumed international flights to boost their airline and tourism industry which are badly hit by the restrictions imposed to contain coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s health emergencies programme, stressed that the economy won’t be revived unless countries get their way out of Covid-19.“If you go on a country from 10% normal travel and you go overnight to 100% travel, then our advice is always to start slowly, open up slowly, take it step-it-step and see if that affects your situation positively or negatively and then adjust as needed,” Ryan said.Traveling safely during #COVID19 requires careful consideration and planning. @DrMikeRyan and Dr @mvankerkhove discuss how you can make safe travel-related decisions as the northern hemisphere summer continues ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/iItOhCJdePMaria Van Kerkhove, Covid-19 technical lead at WHO, asked travellers to take responsibility while travelling by adhering to guidelines required by governments and airlines.“If they asked to wear a mask throughout travelling wear that mask, carry your hand gel with you, take all of those precautions as you go through that stage of leaving your house to entering into that other country, that other place that you live,” she said.“The virus travels in people and so you could be infected in the place that you are travelling. You have a responsibility to keep yourself safe, keep those who you're travelling with safe and also not to bring the virus around with you,” Van Kerkhove added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-shares-guidelines-for-safe-travel-as-countries-reopen-their-borders-101628690785681.html
11-08-2021||World||'Will make them realize': North Korea warns US, South Korea over 'hostile acts'||North Korea on Wednesday denounced South Korea for moving ahead with its plan of joint military exercise with the United States despite repeated warnings. In a statement released on state media Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol said that “peace and trust” touted by Seoul was a mere wordplay as they opted for an alliance with “outsiders” but not with “compatriots”.“As we have already clarified, we will make them realize by the minute what a dangerous choice they made and what a serious security crisis they will face because of their wrong choice,” KCNA quoted Kim, a former Pyongyang’s spymaster, as saying.South Korea and the US have begun preliminary military drills as they prepare for full-scale exercises scheduled from August 16-26, reported the Yonhap news agency. On Tuesday, South Korea said that the North didn’t answer routine calls in inter-Korean hotlines that were recently restored hotlines suspended a year ago by Pyongyang.While Seoul and Washington insist that preliminary drills are designed to examine the allies’ readiness to respond to a potential contingency, Pyongyang sees it as confrontation. Kim said South Korea must realise “how dearly they have to pay for answering our good faith with hostile acts after letting go the opportunity for improved inter-Korean relations.”“It is clear that there is no other option for us as South Korea and the US opted for confrontation with our state, without making any change,” he added.North Korea has been facing sanctions from the United States over its nuclear activity and intercontinental ballistic missiles. Washington recently indicated that it is not willing to lift any sanctions as a precondition to restart talks with Pyongyang. US state department spokesperson Ned Price said last week that the Biden administration welcomes the restoration of inter-Korean communication lines and is willing to meet North Korean leaders “anytime, anywhere, without preconditions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-make-them-realize-north-korea-warns-us-south-korea-over-hostile-acts-101628682536768.html

In his statement, he said India's daily cases per million people is 28.84, while the figure for Iran and Iraq are 421.98 and 276.19, respectively.The UK government in its statement on why it kept Pakistan on the red list said, "In Pakistan, the combination of a deteriorating epidemiological situation, combined with low testing rates and limited genomic surveillance, presents a high risk that an outbreak of a new variant, or existing VoC, will not be identified before it is imported to the UK." It also said the current trajectory of the pandemic in Pakistan is also of particular concern.

The banned songs’ list is yet to be released.Officially, China has nearly 50,000 entertainment venues such as karaoke bars, which have a basic music library of over 100,000 songs, the Xinhua report said.Unofficially, the number is likely higher, making that much more difficult for the government machinery to regulate their content.The first time the ministry had taken a similar step was in 2015 when it had banned 120 songs, which “trumpet obscenity, violence, crime or harm social morality”.A report by the Global Times then said: “With titles such as ‘Beijing Hooligans’, ‘Don’t Want to Go to School’ and ‘Suicide Diary’, the banned songs were described as having severely problematic content which violate an online cultural management regulation”.Karaoke, also known as KTV in China, was invented in Japan in the 1970s and introduced to China in the late 1980s, the Xinhua report added.It is popular across age groups and is often considered a favoured mode of socialising among friends and families.In early 2018, the Chinese government had also cracked down on the country’s emerging hip hop music scene, asking broadcasters not to air artistes with tattoos, singing hip hop music and others who were in conflict with the CPC’s values.Given the party’s disapproval, Chinese rappers, instead, have turned patriotic.Like the 100 rappers who recently collaborated for the patriotic rap song “100%” to mark the CPC’s 100th birthday on July 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-ban-karaoke-songs-that-endanger-territorial-integrity-101628681910013.html
11-08-2021||World||Chinese media caught quoting non-existent Swiss expert questioning Covid probe||Chinese state media outlets have removed references of an “alleged Swiss biologist” quoted widely in local and social media on the politicisation of the Covid-19 origin probe after the Switzerland embassy in Beijing said it was a fake news.The removal of articles containing quotes by Wilson Edwards came after the Swiss embassy tweeted that it was unable to trace any citizen or biologist by the name.In the tweet, the embassy said it could not find any registry of a citizen by the name or any academic articles written by Edwards. “Looking for Wilson Edwards alleged [Swiss] biologist…If you exist, we would like to meet you. But it is more likely that this is a fake news,’’ part of the Swiss embassy tweet read.In a more detailed statement attached to the tweet, the embassy said it informs the Chinese public that the news is false. “In the last several days, a large number of press articles and social media posts citing an alleged Swiss biologist have been published in China. While we appreciate the attention on our country, the Embassy of Switzerland must unfortunately inform the Chinese public that this news is false,” the statement from Switzerland read.The deftly written Swiss statement added: “While we assume that the spreading of this story was done in good faith by the media and netizens, we kindly ask that anyone having published this story take it down and publish a corrigendum.”Chinese state media outlets like People’s Daily (PD), China Daily and national broadcaster CGTN were among state media outlets, which had published articles quoting him, attributing it to Edwards’ Facebook profile.The articles cannot be accessed anymore though the PD’s Facebook update, quoting the person remains.The Swiss embassy said the Facebook account was opened in late July and only had three friends. “It is likely that this Facebook account was not opened for social networking purposes,” the Swiss embassy added.A screenshot from the China Daily article, which quotes Wilson, and is circulating online, said: “He (Edwards) said on his Facebook account: ‘As a biologist, I’ve witnessed in consternation over the past months how the origin-tracing of Covid-19 was politicised’.”Communist Party of China’s mouthpiece, People’s Daily’s English website too quoted him. “A European biologist has come to the fore with a startling claim that a World Health Organization (WHO) advisory group on tracing the origins of pathogens, including the virus responsible for the pandemic, would become a political tool.“Bearing the name Wilson Edwards, the person took to social media, including Facebook and Twitter, on July 24 to describe how much he was worried about the ‘WHO’s independence’,” the People’s Daily wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-media-caught-quoting-non-existent-swiss-expert-questioning-covid-probe-101628679869956.html

While the Chinese city of Hotan in Xinjiang province has been named the most polluted city, Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh took the second spot on the list with an average PM2.5 concentration of 106.6µg/m3. PM2.5 refers to fine particulate matter suspended in the air that is two and a half microns or less in width.The air pollution in China’s Hotan, with a PM2.5 of 110.2µg/m3, was largely attributed to local sandstorms given its proximity to the Taklimakan Desert, the world’s largest shifting sand desert. In the case of Ghaziabad, the report says massive traffic volumes in the “gateway” to Uttar Pradesh were likely the cause of the high levels of air pollution.Also Read | Air pollution linked with higher risk of dementia: StudyBangladesh’s Manikganj is in the third position on the list of the world’s most polluted cities with a PM2.5 of 80.2µg/m3. “As one of the fastest developing countries around the world, with its industrial sector growing at a rate of 13% per year, vehicles and industrial emissions are the major contributors to air pollution in this country of 165 million people,” the author said.Of the 50 most polluted cities worldwide, 49 are in Bangladesh, China, Pakistan, and India.

A government official who spoke to the Washington Post on grounds of anonymity said the US military now estimates Kabul’s imminent fall will occur within three months, while others cautioned that it might happen within a month.This news came hours after the Taliban took Faizabad, capital of the northeastern province of Badakhshan, and the eighth provincial capital to fall to the insurgent forces in six days. Badakhshan borders Tajikistan, Pakistan and China. The Taliban had laid siege to Faizabad before launching the final offensive on August 10. The Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) retreated after heavy fighting for hours, Jawad Mujadidi, a provincial council member from Badakhshan told reporters.With the fall of Faizabad, entire northeast Afghanistan will come under the Taliban’s rule, which now controls 65% of the country. A senior European Union official told the Associated Press (AP) on August 10 that the insurgent forces are threatening to take over 11 other provincial capitals to cut off Kabul’s support system, which is reliant on the northern forces. For years the northern part of Afghanistan was the only peaceful region with little presence of the Taliban.Also Read: Powered by Pakistan, Taliban racing towards KabulPresident Biden has reiterated his stance of continuing with the withdrawal of US forces by the end of August, stating explicitly that the matter is not up for debate. “We spent over a trillion dollars over 20 years. We trained and equipped, with modern equipment, over 300,000 Afghan forces. And Afghan leaders have to come together,” Biden told reporters in the White House. The Taliban had promised the US that their troops won’t be attacked and Afghanistan won’t be used as fostering international terrorism in exchange for the withdrawal of US troops but it had never agreed to a ceasefire with the Afghan government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-might-capture-kabul-within-3-months-us-expresses-concern-101628675697502.html
11-08-2021||World||After low-key 2020, India’s I-Day celebrations in Canada to be lively affair||The Indian-origin community in Canada is preparing for expansive 2021 Independence Day celebrations on August 15 as Covid-19 restrictions in the country have been relaxed following high vaccination levels.The main event will be held in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) as “India Day” will be marked on Sunday with a drive-thru parade, organised by Panorama India, which is a Canada-based community body. The “India Day” parade and celebrations were in-person events until 2019, when it attracted nearly 85,000 persons at its downtown Toronto venue. The clock towers in the GTA cities of Brampton and Mississauga will be illuminated in the colours of the India flag on Sunday evening, as will Toronto’s iconic landmark building, CN Tower.Last year, the parade was held entirely online due to the coronavirus pandemic, but plans for this year’s big occasion are ambitious.Organisers are expecting nearly 1,000 vehicles to participate in the drive-thru event in Mississauga, in the GTA. The event will also feature live performances depicting the culture of 21 states. The event will also be live-streamed, with Panorama India head Sumeeta Kohli saying the emphasis is on “safety” while creating an outing experience for demographics worst hit by pandemic measures, such as seniors and children.Kohli said the “effort” was “to bring back the feeling of live celebration and yet ensure safety and all Covid protocols”. She added they wanted to “make the first ever India Day drive thru parade a unique and special event”.A number of cars will feature in celebrations planned in British Columbia, as the organizations - Friends of India in Canada and Gurukul Canada - are putting together a Tiranga Yatra that will feature a cavalcade of vehicles travelling from the town of Surrey to the Indian consulate in Vancouver. Neema Manral, secretary of Friends of India in Canada, said they expected over 300 cars to participate in the rally to mark the day. “We’ve invited people from all communities and have taken police permission for the route,” she said.Meanwhile, Calgary, in the province of Alberta, will host an in-person event dubbed India Fest at an indoor venue in the city. However, keeping Covid-related safety in mind, organisers will limit attendance to 250 people. Principal organiser Sonia Joshi said the focus is on “freedom” this year as the community felt like hostages to the pandemic for months. The attempt this year is at “bringing us all together in a safe environment with almost all vaccinated”, she said.Other cities will also witness celebratory events, including Montreal, where a flag-hoisting ceremony is being organised by the Canada-India Global Forum, its national president Shivendra Dwivedi said. Montreal traditionally hosts an “India Day” parade, organised by the India Canada Organisation, which Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had attended in 2017. However, festivities will be limited to a park, with attendance capped at 50 persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-low-key-2020-india-s-i-day-celebrations-in-canada-to-be-lively-affair-101628670209878.html

Qadri made this claim while appearing for a show on ARY News.Saudi Arabia, on August 9, opened applications, with conditions, from devotees vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) for entry into the kingdom for Umrah, a pilgrimage to Mecca which, unlike Hajj, can be undertaken at any time of the year.Also Read | Umrah pilgrimage: Saudi Arabia to reopen borders for vaccinated travellersAccording to Saudi Arabia’s health ministry, travellers,who have completed two doses of the made-in-China vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), including Sinovac and Sinopharm, should get a booster dose of any of the four other authorised vaccines in the country, to be granted entry. “All visitors arriving in the country with a valid tourism visa must provide evidence of a full course of one of the four vaccines currently recognised: two doses of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, or Moderna vaccines, or a single dose of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine,” the guidelines, which were issued by the Saudi Arabian e-visa portal, stated.Additionally, the guidelines mandate that only those devotees, who have been duly inoculated with a Covid-19 vaccine, will be allowed to enter the holy mosques, including the Al-Masjid an-Nabawi (The Prophet’s Mosque) and Masjid al-Haram (The Great Mosque).Saudi Arabia aims to gradually increase the number of devotees arriving for Umrah to 2 million, from the current 60,000 per month. In July, it welcomed devotees for the annual Hajj pilgrimage; the number, however, was restricted for the second year in a row due to the coronavirus pandemic.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-among-9-countries-barred-by-saudi-arabia-for-umrah-claims-minister-101628664436705.html

Referring to China's conviction and sentencing of the Canadian businessman as "unacceptable and unjust", Trudeau said that the trial "did not satisfy even the minimum standards required by international law."Spavor was under detention since 2018 under espionage charges. The case has been linked to Beijing's pressure campaign against the Canadian government over the arrest of an executive at tech giant Huawei. The development came a day after the death sentence imposed on another Canadian national was upheld in China.Issuing a statement from his office in Ontario, Trudeau said that the verdict against Spavor came after "more than two and a half years of arbitrary detention" and "a lack of transparency in the legal process"."For Mr. Spavor, as well as for Michael Kovrig who has also been arbitrarily detained, our top priority remains securing their immediate release," Trudeau said in his statement. "We will continue working around the clock to bring them home as soon as possible."Trudeau also added a word for Spavor's kin and promised all help from the federal government in tiding across the difficult time.“Our thoughts, and the thoughts of all Canadians, are with Mr. Spavor and his loved ones during this incredibly difficult time," he said. "The Government of Canada continues to provide consular assistance to Mr. Spavor and his family as we work to secure his safe return."The prime minister of Canada also thanked the nation's allies, partners, and friends for their solidarity and support for the release of Spavor and Kovrig, and their opposition to the "practice of arbitrary detention.""We will not rest until they are safely brought home," Trudeau vowed.Notably, the verdict by the Chinese court today is testing what political commentators have called an already "strained" relationship between Canada and China. Spavor and fellow Canadian ex-diplomat Kovrig were detained in China in what critics labeled “hostage politics” after the executive, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested at the Vancouver airport in late 2018 at the request of US authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unacceptable-unjust-trudeau-fumes-after-china-jails-canadian-man-for-spying-101628661852006.html
11-08-2021||World||Canadian province of Quebec to implement Covid-19 vaccine passports||The Canadian province of Quebec will start recognising Covid-19 vaccine passports or passes from September 1, which will limit the public’s access to certain facilities such as restaurants and gyms.The measure was first announced by Quebec’s premier Francois Legault on August 5, with the rationale forwarded being that those fully vaccinated against Covid-19 should have “a somewhat normal life”. The details of the new system were unveiled by provincial health minister Christian Dubé on Tuesday.It will allow those who have both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine to access non-essential services such as bars, restaurants, sporting facilities and gyms as well as cinemas and public events like concerts and festivals.“The idea is for us to only allow people with the passport to access these services as of September 1, instead of closing them,” said Dube, according to The Montreal Gazette. The vaccine passports or passes will be available on a mobile app that will be launched before September 1, while those without smartphones will be allowed to carry hard copies of proof of vaccination.Two pilot projects are being launched, one at a gym and another one at a sports bar, to test the system before it goes live for the provincial population.“Taking into account the increase in [Covid-19] cases, the fall coming up with back to school and back to work, and the expected prevalence of the Delta variant, the conditions are there to deploy the vaccination passport,” Dubé said, according to the news outlet CBC News.According to Canada’s chief public health officer Theresa Tam, at the “national level, the Delta variant currently accounts for the majority of recently reported VOC (variants of concern) cases”. In a statement, Tam said the latest national seven-day moving average of 1,294 new cases reported daily from August 3 to August 9 was an increase of 58% the previous week. “With early signs of a Delta-driven wave beginning and the fall approaching, efforts to increase the proportion of fully vaccinated Canadians and reinforce individual precautions per local public health advice are crucial to reducing virus spread and lowering the risk of a resurgence that could lead to healthcare capacity being exceeded this coming fall and winter,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-province-of-quebec-to-implement-covid-19-vaccine-passports-101628659708764.html
11-08-2021||World||Germany's train drivers are on a nationwide strike, here's why||Train drivers and railway workers in Germany are on a nationwide strike over wages, news agency AFP reported. The strike began last night around 7pm (local time; it translates to around 10:30pm on Tuesday as per the Indian Standard Time) when the walkout began with cargo trains. Hours later, the strike is scheduled to extend to the passenger train network, the news agency added, noting that only one in four long-distance trains will be in service on Wednesday and Thursday.This is the first strike to hit rail traffic in Germany since December 2018, when a stoppage was called for four hours. The issue has now dealt a blow to summer holidaymakers in Germany and added up to the logistics and supply problems already plaguing the country's industry.Deutsche Bahn (DB), a German railway company that is also one of the largest operators of its type in Europe, blasted the move as an "unnecessary escalation on the back of rail customers"."Just as people are travelling more again and using trains, GDL leaders are destroying the upswing that we urgently need given the huge damage from the coronavirus pandemic," said Martin Seiler, DB board member for human resources and legal affairs.The GDL (Gewerkschaft Deutscher Lokomotivführer), representing workers in train companies, is the trade union that is organising the railway strike. Its leader Claus Weselsky, in turn, accused the DB managers of "lining their pockets while the little guys are getting pockets picked".The union claims to be fighting for better remuneration for train drivers. Its demands include a 1.4 per cent pay hike and a bonus of 600 euros for 2021, and a further wage rise of 1.8 per cent in 2022. The Deutsche Bahn company, on the other hand, has offered to phase in a 3.2-per cent wage increase in two steps but with the intention to apply it in 2022 and 2023.Critics have accused GDL of using the strike to gain greater influence and attract members from larger union EVG -- which covers railway workers and public transport employees. However, Weselsky argued that the GDL "intentionally chose this timeframe in the week to limit the impact on weekend and holiday traffic" and that it was "never the best time" for a strike.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germanys-train-drivers-are-on-a-nationwide-strike-here-s-why-101628651401523.html
11-08-2021||World||Chinese court convicts Canadian Michael Spavor on charge of espionage||A Chinese court sentenced a Canadian tour organiser to 11 years in prison for spying, a ruling that appeared to be timed to show Beijing’s anger over extradition proceedings in Vancouver against Huawei Technologies Co.’s chief financial officer.Michael Spavor, who organised tours to North Korea, was sentenced after being found guilty of stealing and illegally providing state secrets to other countries, the Dandong Intermediate People’s Court said in a statement Wednesday. Spavor had waited for the verdict for five months since a two-hour trial held behind closed doors in March.The court said Spavor would also be deported, without specifying whether it was before or after he served his sentence.The decision was part of a flurry of court proceedings on both sides of this Pacific this week, as Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou made a final push in Vancouver to fight U.S.-led extradition efforts. Spavor is among a handful of Canadians in China facing stiff punishments in the wake of Meng’s December 2018 arrest, which the Communist Party views as a politically motivated attack on one of its chief technology champions.On Tuesday, China upheld a death sentence for Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, who had seen his punishment for drug trafficking increased to death on appeal in January 2019. Canadian Foreign Minister Marc Garneau condemned the decision to reject Schellenberg’s latest appeal and urged Chinese authorities to grant him clemency.Canadian diplomats said they viewed the decisions as politically driven. “I don’t think it’s a coincidence that things are happening right now while events are going on in Vancouver,” Canadian Ambassador Dominic Barton told reporters Tuesday in China.Spavor was detained along with Michael Kovrig -- a Hong Kong-based analyst at the International Crisis Group and former Canadian diplomat -- days after Meng’s arrest and has been jailed ever since. The Canadian side hasn’t received any indication on the timing of Kovrig’s verdict, according to Barton.People convicted of serious violations of the section of law cited by Chinese authorities face between 10 years and life in prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sentences-canadian-national-michael-spavor-to-11-years-in-jail-for-spying-101628650976063.html

Speaking to reporters at the White House Biden stressed that Afghan leaders should "come together" to fight for their country. The Afghan troops outnumber the Taliban and must want to fight... "They've got to fight for themselves, fight for their nation," he said at the media interaction as per Reuters' report.The US President also said that he does not regret his decision to pull out as the Taliban insurgents now expanding their control to over 50 per cent of the country, nearing it to another civil war.Washington has spent more than $1 trillion over 20 years and lost thousands of troops, Biden noted, adding that the United States continues to provide significant air support, food, equipment and salaries to Afghan forces, according to Reuters.Afghans are beginning to realise they have got to come together politically at the top, he also said. "We are going to continue to keep our commitment. But I do not regret my decision."As of Tuesday, Taliban insurgents have gained control of 65 per cent of Afghanistan since the US troops started withdrawing from the country in May this year. The Pentagon says that it has already withdrawn more than 90 per cent of troops from Afghanistan. President Biden has ordered the withdrawal of all the US troops from Afghanistan by September 11.On Tuesday, Pul-e-Khumri northern Afghanistan became the seventh regional capital - the eighth provincial city - to come under the control of the Islamist militants in about a week. It is located at 230 kilometres (140 mi) north of Kabul, the capital city of Afghanistan.In Aibak, a provincial capital between the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif and Kabul, Taliban fighters were moving into government buildings. Most government forces appeared to have withdrawn.For years, the northern region of Afghanistan has remained mostly peaceful. Since now the insurgents are focussing on that region experts say that their strategy seems to be to take the north, and border crossings in the north, west and south, and then close in on Kabul.Earlier, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters the US went to Afghanistan to deliver justice to those who attacked them on September 11, to disrupt terrorists seeking to use Afghanistan as a safe haven to attack the United States. “We achieved those objectives some years ago,” she said. “We judge the threat now against our homeland, which is his responsibility as commander-in-chief to focus on, as being one where the threat emanates from outside of Afghanistan,” she added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/do-not-regret-us-president-rules-out-any-change-to-troop-withdrawal-decision-101628649530148.html

This comes days after Toofan Omari, a journalist and head of radio station Paktia Voice, was shot dead by the insurgents in Kabul.Fighting has intensified on the outskirts of Mazar-e-Sharif, the fourth largest city of Afghanistan and capital of Balkh province. India on Tuesday commenced an evacuation process for its diplomats and nationals from Mazar-e-Sharif, a month after it had undertaken a similar move to move out officials and security persons from the consulate in Kandahar.The Afghan National Security and Defence Forces (ANDSF) are determined to not let the Taliban take Mazar-e-Sharif; they successfully pushed back the insurgents' offensive and regained control over Nahr-e-Shahi, Tolo News reported.Afghanistan is witnessing a surge in violence as the Taliban have intensified their offensive in wake of the pullback of US and Nato forces. These forces will be out of the country by August 31.US President Joe Biden on Tuesday said he does not regret his decision to withdraw American forces from Afghanistan amid the Taliban offensive and urged the leaders of the war-torn country to unite and "fight for their nation".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-target-civilians-in-afghanistan-in-push-towards-kabul-101628646567018.html
