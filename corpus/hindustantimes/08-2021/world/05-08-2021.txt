A gas station, hotel and bar were among many fixtures gutted in the town, which dates to California’s Gold Rush era and has some structures more than a century old.It wasn't immediately known how many buildings were demolished, but photos and video from the scene indicate the destruction was widespread.“We lost Greenville tonight,” U.S. Rep. Doug LaMalfa, who represents the area, said in an emotional Facebook video. “There's just no words.”As the fire’s north and eastern sides exploded, the Plumas County Sheriff’s Office issued a Facebook posting warning the town’s approximately 800 residents: “You are in imminent danger and you MUST leave now!”The growing blaze that broke out July 21 was the state’s largest wildfire and had blackened over 504 square miles (1,305 square kilometers). It had burned dozens of homes before making its new run.“We did everything we could,” fire spokesman Mitch Matlow said. “Sometimes it’s just not enough.”About 100 miles (160 km) to the south, officials said between 35 and 40 homes and other structures burned in the fast-moving River Fire that broke out Wednesday near Colfax, a town of about 2,000 residents. Within hours it ripped through nearly 4 square miles (10 square kilometers) of dry brush and trees. There was no containment and about 6,000 people were under evacuation orders across Placer and Nevada counties, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.Early in the week, some 5,000 firefighters had made progress on the Dixie Fire, saving some threatened homes, bulldozing pockets of unburned vegetation and managing to surround a third of the perimeter.More fire engines and bulldozers were being ordered to bolster the fight, Matlow said. On Wednesday, the fire grew by thousands of acres and an additional 4,000 people were ordered to evacuate, bringing nearly 26,500 people in several counties under evacuation orders, he said.Red flag weather conditions of high heat, low humidity and gusty afternoon and evening winds erupted Wednesday and were expected to be a continued threat.Winds were expected to change direction multiple times on Thursday, putting pressure on firefighters at sections of the fire that haven't seen activity in several days, officials said.The trees, grass and brush were so dry that “if an ember lands, you’re virtually guaranteed to start a new fire,” Matlow said.The Dixie Fire was running parallel to a canyon area that served as a chimney, making it so hot that it created enormous pyrocumulus columns of smoke. These clouds bring chaotic winds, making a fire “critically erratic” so it's hard to predict the direction of growth, he added.Dawn Garofalo fled with a dog and two horses from a friend's mountain property, and watched the soaring cloud grow from the west side of Lake Almanor.“There’s only one way in and one way out,” she said Wednesday. “I didn’t want to be stuck up there if the fire came through.”And about 150 miles (240 kilometers) to the west of the Dixie Fire, the lightning-sparked McFarland Fire threatened remote homes along the Trinity River in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. The fire was only 7% contained after burning through nearly 33 square miles (85 square kilometers) of drought-stricken vegetation.Similar risky weather was expected across Southern California, where heat advisories and warnings were issued for interior valleys, mountains and deserts for much of the week.Heat waves and historic drought tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in America's West. Scientists say climate change has made the region much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.More than 20,000 firefighters and support personnel were battling 97 large, active wildfires covering 2,919 square miles (7,560 square kilometers) in 13 U.S. states, the National Interagency Fire Center said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-lost-greenville-raging-dixie-fire-decimates-northern-california-town-101628177256229.html

Afghanistan has been witnessing a surge in violence after the Taliban fighters intensified their offensive against the government forces.Pakistan has been long accused of helping the Taliban militarily, financially and with intelligence, a claim repeatedly denied by Islamabad. With US troops nearing their final withdrawal, Pakistan is being seen as an important player in the Afghan peace process.Yusuf told a press briefing in Washington DC that Pakistan wants to maintain good relations with the Afghan government but their “vitriol and rhetoric” was making it impossible, the Dawn newspaper reported."We are beginning to see a very conscious, deliberate effort by the Afghan government to scapegoat Pakistan," said Pakistan’s NSA, who was wrapping up a week of talks with the Biden administration."We have made it absolutely clear that we are with the international community on where this goes. But the world also needs to be clear that the US invests in a political settlement,” he added.Also Read | Taliban terrorists shoot 21-year-old Afghan girl dead for not wearing veil: ReportThe Taliban has made rapid gains in Afghanistan and now reportedly controls 223 districts even after a late push back by the government forces. Reiterating the statement of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, Yusuf said that the stakeholders have to arrive at “some compromise given the ground reality”. He added that Pakistan has no leverage over the Taliban after the troop withdrawal.The United States wants Pakistan to keep its borders open for Afghan refugees as the war-torn region looks at a possible civil war. But Yusuf said Pakistan, which currently hosts about 3.5 refugees, is no longer in a position to accept more refugees. "Peace in Afghanistan is non-negotiable for us. We under no circumstances are prepared to see protracted instability that in the past has caused spillover into Pakistan," the NSA said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-accuses-afghan-govt-of-making-it-scapegoat-amid-taliban-offensive-101628180288040.html

On Wednesday, WHO director-general Tedros Adhnom Ghebreyesus called for a moratorium on third vaccine dose of recommended two-dose regimen until September end in a bid to enable all countries to vaccinate at least 10% of their population.According to the WHO, low-income countries have been able to administer only 1.5 doses for every 100 people due to a lack of vaccine supplies. Calling for an urgent reversal of global vaccine policy, Tedros told a press briefing that 80% of the vaccine doses administered worldwide have gone to high- and upper-middle-income countries."I understand the concern of all governments to protect their people from the Delta variant. But we cannot accept countries that have already used most of the global supply of vaccines using even more of it, while the Earth globe Europe-Africa's most vulnerable people remain unprotected," the WHO chief said.Despite the strong statement by the UN health agency, France, Germany and Israel appear to press ahead with their plan. After WHO’ call, French President Emmanuel Macron said his government was working on rolling out a third Covid-19 vaccine dose for the elderly and vulnerable from September, reported news agency Reuters.German health ministry stated that it intends to administer boosters to immunocompromised patients, elderly and nursing home residents from September but would also donate at least 30 million doses to poorer countries. "We want to provide the vulnerable groups in Germany with a precautionary third vaccination and at the same time support the vaccination of as many people in the world as possible," Reuters quoted the health ministry as saying.Israel has already kicked off a campaign to give booster doses to older citizens. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said in a statement that those over the age of 60 are six times more susceptible to severe illness without a third dose. While the United States hasn’t directly commented on the WHO’s call, the White House said the administration was prepared to provide a third dose of vaccine if needed.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/these-countries-to-ignore-who-s-call-for-moratorium-on-covid-booster-shots-101628174984057.html

China will continue to do everything in its power to help developing countries cope with the outbreak,” Xi was quoted as saying.In May, 2020, in a speech at the 73rd World Health Assembly, Xi had pledged that China will make its coronavirus vaccine a global public good once available, a promise he repeated in April this year at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2021.Besides administering more than 1.7 billion doses of vaccines within the country, Beijing has exported and donated the largest number of jabs globally - despite concerns over the safety and efficacy of China-made shots.China has so far provided more than 700 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines overseas and, over the next four months, will provide 110 million doses to Covax, a global vaccine-sharing initiative, the Chinese foreign ministry said in late July.It has also donated some 26 million jabs worldwide.Chinese vaccine companies have started joint production in many countries including the UAE, Indonesia, Malaysia, Egypt, Brazil, Turkey, Pakistan, and Mexico, with producing capacity exceeding 200 million doses.Xi’s statement on Thursday comes in the backdrop of China experiencing the worst Delta variant-driven Covid-19 outbreak since last year.Over 500 locally transmitted cases have been reported from across the country, triggering mass testing, lockdowns, and restrictions on travel.The ongoing outbreak has spread to Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first detected in late 2019, which had been virus-free since China contained the initial outbreak there early last year.The city has detected 19 cases as of August 4 and is currently testing its entire population of 12 million people.A total of 85 new confirmed Covid-19 cases were detected for August 4, down from 96 a day earlier, data from the national health commission (NHC) showed on Thursday; 62 were locally transmitted.As of August 4, mainland China had recorded 93,374 confirmed cases, with the cumulative death toll unchanged at 4,636.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-pledges-2bn-covid-vaccine-doses-to-the-world-prez-101628173074070.html

The probe will also “hold anyone responsible for dereliction of duty,” according to the report.The majority of deaths occurred in the provincial capital city Zhengzhou, where 292 were killed after torrential waters led to landslides, buildings collapsing and the flooding of underground spaces, the official Henan Daily reported, citing the local government. Fifty people were missing across the province, including 47 in Zhengzhou. According to the official tally, 14 people drowned in submerged subway cars, while another six were killed in a swamped tunnel.The deaths prompted local residents to question if the city government had failed to warn the public, shut down transportation in advance and provide timely rescue efforts. Zhengzhou, a city of 10 million, received a year’s worth of rain in just three days last month starting July 20. Across Henan -- a hub for agricultural and food production, coal and metals as well as heavy industry -- more than 14.53 million people were affected, and direct economic loss reached 114.3 billion yuan ($17.7 billion), according to the provincial government.The floods and its aftermaths also added to the tensions between China and the West after the provincial branch of the Communist Youth League, an official arm of the ruling party, used social media to urge members of the public to confront a BBC reporter over his coverage of the disaster, the New York Times reported. Later, a correspondent for German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle was confronted in Zhengzhou by a crowd of people that may have confused him for the BBC journalist.The incident prompted the U.S. to express concern over harassment and intimidation of foreign correspondents in China. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the comments “distort facts, confuse right with wrong, and aim to pressure China with unfounded charges,” adding that rights of foreign journalists were “fully protected.”Officials have warned that China can expect more extreme weather events amid climate change. A typhoon struck Zhejiang province south of Shanghai last month, causing 3.35 billion yuan in damage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-orders-probe-into-henan-floods-as-death-toll-surges-past-300-101627911178800.html

Speaking to CNN, the tech billionaire said he had “several dinners” with Epstein in hopes of raising billions of dollars for combating global health issues. Gates claimed that the relationship ended as soon as he realised Epstein’s assurance regarding the philanthropy project wasn’t a “real thing.”"I had several dinners with him, you know, hoping that what he said about getting billions of philanthropy for global health through contacts that he had might emerge. When it looked like that wasn't a real thing, that relationship ended," the Microsoft co-founder said.Bill Gates and his wife Melinda French Gates announced their divorce in May, triggering media scrutiny of the former’s alleged extramarital affairs. According to Wall Street Journal, Melinda had been working with the divorce lawyer for over a year before the duo announced their separation, partly because of her husband’s dealings with Epstein.Also Read | Bill Gates, Melinda French officially divorced: ReportEpstein, who had pleaded guilty in two state prostitution charges and had registered as a sex offender, hanged himself in 2019 awaiting a sex trafficking trial."It was a huge mistake to spend time with him, to give him the credibility of being there," Gates told CNN while declining to respond to the WSJ report that linked his divorce with the Epstein connection."It's a time of reflection, and at this point, I need to go forward," he added.Earlier this week, a King County Superior Court judge signed the dissolution decree finalising the divorce of Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates. The duo has decided to continue working as co-chairs of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the most influential private foundations in the world. However, if any of them decide that they can’t work together, French Gates will resign her position as co-chair and trustee and will receive personal resources from Gates for her philanthropic work, the foundation said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-was-a-huge-mistake-bill-gates-regrets-meeting-convicted-sex-offender-epstein-101628169984542.html
05-08-2021||World||Fake network using India's Covid-19 situation for pro-China propaganda: Report||A network of more than 350 fake and repurposed social media accounts is pushing pro-China narratives and discrediting those that are critical of the Chinese government, according to a new study. Researchers at the Centre for Information Resilience (CIR) found that the narratives pushed by these fake or repurposed profiles on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube are similar to the content disseminated by Chinese government representatives and state-run media.The study suggests that the network seeks to influence several issues including US gun laws, human rights abuses in Xinjiang, global conflict, racial discrimination and US response to India’s devastating second Covid-19 wave. Citing the grim situation in India during the second Covid wave, the network targets the response of the US.Some of these social media accounts alleged that the US was allowing vaccines to expire when there was a dire need for Covid-19 shots in India. In a YouTube video titled ‘India's out-of-control epidemic highlights the hypocrisy of American human rights’, the social media account claimed that large stockpiles of unused vaccines were kept in factories in the United States when India needed those vaccines.The video also features a tweet from Serum Institute of India (SII) CEO Adar Poonawalla in which he urged US President Joe Biden to lift the embargo on exports of raw material needed for vaccine manufacturing. “Some of the network has promoted long-text memes on Twitter about India and coronavirus with negative sentiment towards the US,” the report said.Some of the Twitter handles involved in pro-China propaganda were found to be using a mix of machine-learning generated images as profile pictures and relying on a much larger network that was using more authentic appearing images, anime images and repurposed accounts. The AI-generated images are created by a type of machine learning framework called StyleGAN to create realistic-looking images of people who don’t exist.Also Read | India prepared for long haul with China over LadakhThe report also suggests that there was a change in ownership of authentic-appearing accounts at some point, either through a “takeover from password dumps or a purchase from a seller of stolen accounts.” The researchers conducted a manual review of hundreds of accounts across different social media platforms and concluded that there are between 300-500 such accounts on Twitter, 40-55 accounts and pages on Facebook and 12 accounts on YouTube.Benjamin Strick, the author of the report and CIR’s director of investigations, said in a statement that the aim of the network appears to delegitimize the West by amplifying pro-Chinese narratives. He said that the content was posted in English and Chinese but there’s no concrete evidence that these accounts are linked to the Chinese government.“The narratives CIR uncovered in this influence operation have strong similarities to content seen on the accounts of Chinese Government representatives and China state-linked media. However, this is not an indication of attribution,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fake-network-using-india-s-covid-19-situation-for-pro-china-propaganda-report-101628165232954.html

The patient, a 43-year-old man who lives in the Sham Shui Po neighbourhood, has, so far, shown no symptoms and has no recent travel history, but Covid-19 antibodies were found in his blood, government officials said, adding he has not been vaccinated.The Centre for Health Protection (CHP), which is Hong Kong’s agency responsible for disease prevention and control, said the man had tested negative for the viral disease under the government’s regular testing requirement since May this year, according to a report by the Straits Times on Thursday.However, after being hospitalised on Tuesday, the man tested positive for antibodies against Covid-19 and the epidemiological, clinical and laboratory findings are compatible with a re-positive case previously undiagnosed, the CHP said in a statement.The patient’s colleagues, neighbours and those who visited the same places that he did during the incubation period would now have to get themselves tested for the virus, according to Bloomberg.The local case came as a setback for Hong Kong which was planning to allow its vaccinated residents and tourists from all but 10 countries to enter the city from August 9.Vaccinated tourists, including those from Canada and the United States, will be allowed to enter Hong Kong for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic last year. And, fully inoculated residents from countries, like India and the United Kingdom, that were banned earlier can come back home.As of Wednesday, Hong Kong has administered vaccines to 2.6 million of its citizens and is urging the remaining ones to receive the jab at the earliest. Bloomberg also reported that schools in the city must have 70 per cent students in a certain grade inoculated before resuming in-person teaching from September. The total Covid-19 cases in Hong Kong currently stand at 12,003 which include 212 deaths, 11,721 recoveries and 70 active cases.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-sees-1st-local-covid-19-case-in-2-months-as-it-readies-for-tourists-101628163507622.html

The terrorists dragged Nazaneen, 21, out of a car while she was on her way to Balkh district centre, according to the report.The Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid, however, has denied the claims.The group has intensified its offensive against Afghan security forces and civilians over the last few weeks as foreign troops are completing the withdrawal. The Taliban has insisted on a “genuine Islamic system”, saying it is the only way to ensure women’s rights are in line with cultural tradition and religious rules.Under the Taliban’s harsh version of Islamic law, girls were banned from school and women accused of crimes such as adultery were stoned to death in stadiums. With the group now reportedly controlling 223 districts, they have reimposed repressive laws that defined their rule from 1996-2001 before they were ousted by a US-led invasion.Also Read | Women can't leave home alone, men have to grow beard: Taliban rules in captured Afghan districtsReports suggest that Islamic fundamentalists are forcing women to cover themselves from head to toe and not allowing them to leave home without a male companion. In some parts captured by the Taliban, they have banned shops from selling goods to women not accompanied by a male relative. People breaking the rules face punishment including public beatings.“They urged women in a statement to not leave without a relative (Moharam) and also urged men to have beards,” Merajuddin Sharifi, a civil society activist, was quoted as saying by Ariana News last month.Meanwhile, Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) are reported to have pushed back the Taliban fighters in some areas in the last 24 hours.

The two other thresholds -- vaccination rate and ICU occupancy -- will remain the same, he said.“Once 40% of adults have been vaccinated, the number of new cases becomes less relevant because most cases show little to no symptoms, hence reducing the burden on public infrastructure,” said Zafrul.While the nation added a record 19,819 infections on Wednesday, 98.1% of the cases showed light to zero symptoms, according to the Health Ministry. Still, there was always a chance that their health may deteriorate over time, Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah said in a statement.With new infections piling up -- daily cases topped a record 20,000 for the first time on Thursday -- the government is focusing on speeding up its vaccination drive. About 31% of the adult population received both doses of the vaccine, and 62% got at least one dose as on Aug. 3, according to the health ministry.Third phaseThe hospitalization rate must be 3 cases per 100,000 of the population for states to move from the second to the third phase, said Zafrul. Currently, the states of Penang, Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang and Perak are in the second phase, which allows for opening up more economic sectors.The third phase involves reopening of all economic activities with the exception of those on the negative list, according to the plan. Based on this new indicator, the government allowed Perlis, Sarawak and Labuan to enter the third phase beginning Wednesday, Zafrul said.To get to the final stage, the rate must be 1.3 cases per 100,000 people, he said. States in this phase may reopen their social and economic sectors under new norms, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said in July. Most states are expected to reach this phase as early as October, according to the premier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-to-stop-using-daily-covid-19-cases-as-metric-to-ease-curbs-for-states-101628153074828.html

The nation’s second-largest city last year endured one of the world’s longest and strictest lockdowns, and only emerged from its most recent one on July 28. Sydney, meanwhile, has issued stay-at-home orders until at least August 28.“The advice to me from the experts if we were to wait even just a few days, there is every chance that instead of being locked down for a week, this gets away from us and we are potentially locked down until we all get vaccinated,” Andrews said.The lockdowns show the limits of Australia’s so-called “Covid-zero” strategy, which has relied on closed international borders and rigorous testing to eliminate community transmission of the virus. Its economy, particularly the domestic tourism and retail sectors, is increasingly being hit by the outbreaks.The move by Melbourne authorities comes on the same day that New South Wales state reported 262 new infections -- a record number since the highly contagious variant leaked into Sydney’s community in mid-June. Five more people died, and four of them weren’t vaccinated, Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters in the city, which has been in lockdown for almost six weeks.The outbreak’s spread to other regions of New South Wales saw Berejiklian on Thursday announce that the Hunter Valley region -- including Newcastle, a city of around 500,000 people -- will be placed into a one-week lockdown.“Every jurisdiction around the world is finding delta challenging,” Berejiklian said. “We can try and eliminate it but we know the vaccine is critical to stopping the spread.”Australia’s federal government said last week the country would begin reopening and start to avoid snap lockdowns once 70% of the entire adult population had been fully vaccinated. Plans to reopen have been hampered by a tardy vaccine roll-out, with only enough doses to cover 25% of the population administered.Clamping DownEven as other developed economies like the U.S. and U.K. open up, Australia is further isolating after imposing strict border restrictions when the pandemic began early last year.The slow vaccine drive -- which has placed renewed criticism on Prime Minister Scott Morrison ahead of elections due by May -- has made it particularly vulnerable to the delta variant, which is increasingly leaking out of the quarantine system for international arrivals.The lockdowns show the limits of Australia’s so-called “Covid-zero” strategy, which has relied on closed international borders and rigorous testing to eliminate community transmission of the virus. Its economy, particularly the domestic tourism and retail sectors, is increasingly being hit by the outbreaks.Queensland state recorded 16 new cases in the community on Thursday, and it was unclear whether Brisbane and other regions there would exit lockdown as planned on Sunday. Eleven other infections were detected aboard a LNG tanker off the city of Gladstone, authorities said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/melbourne-locks-down-for-6th-time-as-delta-spreads-in-australia-101628145319326.html

Being the widest strait in the Ryukyu Islands, it is one of the only few international waterways that China intends to use to gain access to the Pacific Ocean from the East China Sea.It is in this region that Japan and China are involved in a dispute over the Senkaku Islands (Diaoyutai Islands), a territorial row that has mired diplomatic relations between both countries since at least the early 2010s. Beijing, which continues to claim the Senkaku Islands as the country's 'inherent territory', has rapidly built up artificial islands with military infrastructure in the region.China also claims complete sovereignty over Taiwan, a democracy of about 24 million people located off the southeastern coast of mainland China, despite the fact that the two lands have been governed separately for more than seven decades.In the process, China is now laying claim of sovereignty over almost the entire maritime region.Japan's defence plan against ChinaJapan's new missile installations are meant to serve as a deterrent and are well within the range of disputed territories such as the Diaoyutai Islands, ensuring that the country will have a suitable defence in the case of a potential Chinese attack in the region.With the new missile chain set to be deployed next year, the Ishikagi Island will become the fourth land in the Nansei island chain to be armed with missiles. This island chain runs southwest from Kyushu to Taiwan and is situated on the strategic first island chain that stretches from the Kuril Islands in the north to Borneo in the south.One of the new units will also reportedly include surface-to-ship and ground-to-air missiles, while another unit will handle the initial reaction to a military attack. The missile batteries on Ishigaki will join existing units on Amami-Oshima, Okinawa, and Miyako Islands, according to Taiwan News.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-ups-the-ante-against-china-plans-to-deploy-nukes-near-taiwan-next-year-101628140356132.html

In a tweet on July 30, Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada confirmed the review was “under way”.Ken Inchausti, head, investor relations & communications of Pennsylvania-based Ocugen, told the Hindustan Times that while it was not possible to apply a “specific timeline to Health Canada’s review”, they believed that the “Phase 3 data submitted provide a compelling case for the efficacy and safety of Covaxin”.With Canadian health authorities warning of the portents of a potential fourth wave in the country sparked by the Delta variant, he underscored the relevance of Covaxin in this context. In response to emailed queries, Inchausti said, “With the rapid spread of Covid-19, including its Delta variant, it is clear that additional vaccine options have the potential to help reverse this negative trend. Currently, there are no head-to-head studies between Covaxin and other Covid-19 vaccines. Covaxin is the only investigational Covid-19 vaccine to demonstrate, in a controlled clinical trial, efficacy against the Delta variant. (efficacy rate: 65.2%).”Ocugen’s Canadian affiliate, the Alberta-headquartered Vaccigen is facilitating regulatory activity in the country. Unlike the USA, where the Food and Drug Administration asked Ocugen to apply for full authorisation, Health Canada has allowed EUA application.While Covaxin also waits clearance from the World Health Organization, if it is approved in Canada, it will be an important outcome for thousands of Indian citizens, students, temporary workers and new residents, who have been inoculated by the jab but have to face entry restrictions currently as it is not in the approved list yet. Among the vaccines available in India at this time, only Covishield, the version of Astra Zeneca manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, has been granted EUA in Canada.While Canada has announced it has secured enough vaccines to fully jab its entire eligible population, Inchausti said Covaxin attacked several targets on the actual virus while others only targeted the spike protein. “We believe this has value as we see the virus continue to mutate into new variants through changes in the spike protein,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-covaxin-submits-documents-for-emergency-use-authorisation-in-canada-101628141571775.html

"We're now dealing with, really, a different virus," said Fauci.As the virus continues to spread due to insufficient vaccination rates, it is being given "ample" time to mutate into a more dangerous new variant in the fall and winter, Fauci said."[Q]uite frankly, we're very lucky that the vaccines that we have now do very well against the variants -- particularly against severe illness," Fauci said, emphasizing that this might not be the case with a new variant."If another one comes along that has an equally high capability of transmitting but also is much more severe, then we could really be in trouble," he said."People who are not getting vaccinated mistakenly think it's only about them. But it isn't. It's about everybody else, also."Moreover, other variants are already cropping up. South Korea has reported two cases of highly transmissible delta plus variant of the coronavirus.It is the first time that the country has reported the Delta Plus variant, considered a sublineage of the Delta variant, Yonhap News Agency reported on Tuesday citing the country's Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA).Some experts believe the Delta Plus variant could be more contagious than the Delta variant.The Lambda variant, which originated from Peru last year, has already been detected in the US, reported Axios.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-cases-may-double-in-us-as-variant-worse-than-delta-could-be-coming-says-fauci-101628134601505.html

It did not say if the officers also shot Lanz, but witnesses said there was a volley of gunfire in the incident.Gonzalez was rushed to the hospital but did not survive.A bystander was also injured but taken to hospital with minor injuries and later released, the FBI said.No motive was suggested for the attack. Lanz, of Acworth, Georgia, had a long list of arrests according to local Georgia news reports citing court records.He had been charged with attacking a police officer, making terroristic threats, and burglary, among other offenses.According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, he was out on bail and had been ordered by a judge to be evaluated for mental health and substance abuse.The attack forced a full lockdown of the Pentagon and its thousands of workers for 90 minutes.Gonzalez was mourned by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, who was not in the building at the time of the attack."This fallen officer died in the line of duty, helping protect the tens of thousands of people who work in -- and who visit -- the Pentagon on a daily basis," Austin said in a statement."He and his fellow officers are members of the Pentagon family, and known to us all as professional, skilled, and brave."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-attacker-identified-as-27-year-old-georgia-native-motive-still-unclear-101628132563557.html

Hong Kong re-imposed quarantine on travelers from the mainland, though an exception remained for the southern Guangdong province which neighbors the financial city.Officials reported on Thursday 94 new local infections detected Wednesday, including 32 asymptomatic infections, adding to the country’s broadest Covid-19 threat since the pathogen first emerged in Wuhan in late 2019. Though 61% of the population has been vaccinated, China has stuck to its aggressive containment playbook of mass testing and targeted lockdowns in a bid to stamp out the highly infectious variant.In just two weeks, confirmed cases -- people infected and sickened by the virus -- have grown to more than 500. The infections can be traced back to three cluster areas in China: an outbreak among airport cleaning staff in eastern city Nanjing, another found at a hospital treating Covid patients in Zhengzhou, and sporadic cases detected in Yunnan, the province bordering Myanmar.Delta has spread to Wuhan, which has been virus-free since China contained the initial outbreak there early last year. The city has detected 12 cases as of Aug. 3 and is currently testing its entire population of 12 million people.Chinese authorities urged people to cancel business trips and vacations, while some colleges around the country have asked students, especially those from high-risk areas, to delay their return to school for the new semester.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-imposes-new-curbs-as-delta-variant-swarms-nearly-half-the-country-101628131699453.html
05-08-2021||World||UK eases travel curbs; moves India from 'red' to 'amber list'||Fully vaccinated passengers from India will no longer be subjected to compulsory 10-day hotel quarantine as the UK moved the country from its "red" to "amber" list.Under Britain’s traffic light system for international travel, returning from amber list countries means a 10-day quarantining at home.The change, announced by the Department for Transport, comes into effect from 4 am local time on Sunday."The UAE, Qatar, India and Bahrain will be moved from the red list to the amber list. All changes come into effect Sun 8th August at 4am," UK Transport Secretary tweeted."While it’s right we continue our cautious approach, it’s great news to open more destinations for people wanting to connect with families, friends and businesses across the globe, all thanks to our successful domestic vaccination programme," he said.The decision has come as a relief for the Indian diaspora in the UK, who had been demanding the easing of travel norms between India and Britain.Under the legal rules for countries on the amber list, passengers must take a Covid test three days before departure and book in advance for two COVID tests to be taken upon arrival in England as well as complete a passenger locator form on arrival.On arrival in England, passengers must quarantine at home or in the place they have confirmed as their location for 10 days and take a COVID-19 test on or before day two and on or after day eight.Under-18 and those fully vaccinated in the UK are exempt from the home quarantine, as well as those who have received two doses of Covid vaccine in the EU and US.Also exempt are those “fully vaccinated in the UK or under the UK vaccine programme overseas; under 18 on the day you arrive in England and resident in the UK or in a country with a vaccination programme approved by the UK and part of a UK-approved vaccine trial”.Covishield, the India-manufactured Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, is likely to be covered under this exemption.The update of the travel list came alongside an announcement that the cost for solo travellers from destinations still on the red list staying at a quarantine hotel will go up from August 12, from GBP 1,750 to GBP 2,285.The charge for an additional adult sharing a room will increase from GBP 650 to GBP 1,430.According to the government, this is to "better reflect the increased costs involved".Meanwhile, seven countries are moving to the green list – Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Slovakia, Latvia, Romania and Norway – and France has been moved off the “amber watchlist”.For countries on the green list, people will not have to quarantine when returning from these nations, regardless of their vaccination status, although they will have to take a pre-departure test and another one two days after arrival.Four countries will be put on the red list: Mexico, Georgia, La Reunion and Mayotte.The “green watchlist”, which gives travellers notice of countries whose green status is at risk of changing, remains in place and is unchanged with 16 countries on the list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-eases-travel-curbs-moves-india-from-red-to-amber-list-101628130128683.html
05-08-2021||World||WHO calls for moratorium on booster shots||The World Health Organization called for a moratorium on Covid-19 vaccine booster shots to enable poorer countries to catch up in inoculation rates.The halt on third doses should be in place until at least the end of September, director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a media briefing on Wednesday. That would help achieve the WHO’s goal to vaccinate at least 10% of the population in every country by that date, protecting health care workers and vulnerable people.“I understand the concern of all governments to protect their people from the delta variant, but we cannot and we should not accept countries that have already used most of the global supply of vaccines using even more of it while the world’s most vulnerable people remain unprotected,” Tedros said.He also called on vaccine producers to prioritise Covax, the programme set up last year to equitably distribute vaccines to every corner of the planet. Many lower-income countries rely on Covax, but the initiative has only delivered a fraction of the 1.8 billion doses it aims to ship by early 2022. High-income countries have received almost one dose for every person -- although most vaccines require two doses for full immunisation -- compared with low-income countries, which have only been able to administer 1.5 doses for every 100 people, Tedros said.WHO has been advocating for more equitable distribution of vaccines for months, though it lacks the authority to compel countries to follow its wishes.After an early and effective vaccination drive beginning in December, Israel became the first country last week to widely roll out booster shots to halt a resurgent spread of the virus. A growing number of countries, such as Sweden and Greece, are studying this possibility.“We don’t have a full set of evidence around whether this is needed or not,” said Kate O’Brien, who heads the WHO’s vaccination division. The main reason for the growing infections isn’t the failure of vaccines, but rather the easing of other health measures, she added.In high income countries, 101 doses per 100 people have been injected so far. That figure drops to 1.7 doses per 100 people in the 29 lowest-income countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-calls-for-moratorium-on-booster-shots-101628121391840.html

Temperatures in parts of Greece reached 45 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, in what authorities describe as the worst heat wave since 1987. No deaths or severe injuries have been reported from any of the Greek wildfires.In Turkey, firefighters were battling 16 wildfires across the country on Wednesday, including one near a coal-fired power station, with high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds fanning the flames.In the past eight days, 167 fires have been brought under control, forestry minister Bekir Pakdemirli said.Meanwhile, wildfires have already produced a record amount of carbon emissions in Russia’s Siberian region of Yakutia, with still more weeks of the fire season to come, according to the European Union’s Copernicus satellite monitoring unit.California fire growsCalifornia’s largest wildfire continued to grow on Wednesday as thousands of firefighters prepared for a tougher fight as dangerous weather returns.A red flag warning was issued through Thursday because of hot, bone-dry conditions with winds up to 64kmph. That could drive flames through timber, brush and grass, especially along the northern and northeastern sides of the vast Dixie Fire.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/countries-around-the-world-race-to-rein-in-wildfires-101628120307462.html
05-08-2021||World||Virus infects 200mn people||The Covid-19 pandemic crossed a grim milestone on Wednesday as the total number of coronavirus infections globally has now crossed the 200 million mark, according to the widely followed virus tracker Worldometer. The monitor also showed that the total number of coronavirus-related deaths around the world reached 4.26 million.The World Health Organization (WHO), meanwhile, disclosed that more than 4 million new Covid-19 cases were reported globally in the last week, driven mostly by spikes in the Mideast and Asia. The UN health agency said on Wednesday infections have been increasing for more than a month, although the worldwide number of deaths dropped by about 8%.In West Asia and further east, however, deaths increased by more than a third. In the last week, the highest numbers of coronavirus cases were reported by the US, India, Indonesia, Brazil and Iran. More than 130 countries have now reported cases of the fast-spreading Delta variant of the virus.In Britain, the government will offer coronavirus vaccines to 16 and 17-year-olds in the coming weeks after an independent body of scientists that makes recommendations over the roll-out changed its advice.In China, which is seeing its worst Covid outbreak since the start of the pandemic a year and a half ago, saw on Wednesday dozens more cases reported around the country and the sealing off of a key tourist city.A Covid-19 hotspot was emerging in the city of Zhangjiajie. The city ordered residential communities sealed on Sunday. In an order on Tuesday, officials said no one could leave the city.At the same time, China has begun to promote its vaccination campaign among minors as authorities try to control a surge in Delta cases. More than 450 people have been infected in two weeks, sending millions into lockdown. As many as 71 new domestic cases were reported on Wednesday for the previous day.Indonesia recorded a grim milestone of more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19 on Wednesday, data from the country’s health ministry showed.In France, dozens of restaurants in Brittany have vowed to defy new rules requiring them to check whether diners have been vaccinated, tested negative for Covid-19 or recovered from the disease before serving them. From August 9 on, people will need to produce a Covid health pass for certain activities.With inputs from Sutirtho Patranobis||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virus-infects-200mn-people-101628119465317.html
05-08-2021||World||US plans to require Covid-19 shots for foreign travellers||The Biden administration is taking the first steps toward requiring nearly all foreign visitors to the US to be vaccinated for the coronavirus, a White House official said Wednesday.The requirement would come as part of the administration’s phased approach to easing travel restrictions for foreign citizens to the country. No timeline has yet been determined, as interagency working groups study how and when to safely move toward resuming normal travel. Eventually all foreign citizens entering the country, with some limited exceptions, are expected to need to be vaccinated against Covid-19 to enter the USThe official spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the policy under development.The Biden administration has kept in place travel restrictions that have severely curtailed international trips to the US, citing the spread of the delta variant of the virus. Under the rules, non-US residents who have been to China, the European Schengen area, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Brazil, South Africa and India in the prior 14 days are prohibited from entering the USAll travellers to the US, regardless of vaccination status, are required to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test taken within three days of air travel to the country.The Biden administration has faced pressure to lift some restrictions from affected allies, the air travel industry and families who have been kept separated from loved ones by the rules. Many have complained that the travel restrictions don't reflect the current virus situation — particularly as conditions in the US are worse than in many of the prohibited nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-plans-to-require-covid-19-shots-for-foreign-travellers-101628114786485.html
