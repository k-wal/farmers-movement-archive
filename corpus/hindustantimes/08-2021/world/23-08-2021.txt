23-08-2021||World||New York City says Covid vaccine mandatory for public school teachers, staff||New York City public school teachers and staff will be required to get vaccinated against COVID-19, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday, as the city pushes to get more residents vaccinated and slow the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant.The city's health department will issue an order mandating that all 148,000 staff members in the United States' largest school district get at least one dose of a vaccine by Sept. 27, de Blasio said. School is set to begin in New York City on Sept. 13.In a first for city employees, Department of Education staff will no longer have the option to submit to weekly testing instead."We want our schools to be extraordinarily safe all year long," de Blasio told a news conference.The mayor's announcement followed news on Monday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had granted full approval to the Pfizer Inc/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine, a move public health officials hope will convince Americans hesitant about the shots that they are safe.Meisha Porter, chancellor of New York City's public schools, said at least 63% of employees are vaccinated against COVID-19.School employees in Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington state have also been ordered to get the vaccine.Earlier this month, New York City required proof of COVID-19 vaccination at restaurants, gyms and other businesses. The mandate sparked backlash from some business owners and residents who have sued de Blasio.The latest mandate also could face resistance from the powerful unions representing New York City teachers and staff.Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers (UTF), said the union's priority was to keep children safe and school open. But in a statement, he added that "there are many implementation details, including provisions for medical exceptions, that by law must be negotiated with the UFT and other unions, and if necessary, resolved by arbitration."Efforts to increase vaccination rates and implement public safety measures like mask wearing in schools have faced staunch opposition in some parts of the country, and especially in some Southern states that have been hard hit by the Delta variant.In Florida, some school districts that have defied a ban on mask mandates in public schools issued by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis are now facing the potential loss of some public funding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-says-covid-vaccine-mandatory-for-public-school-teachers-staff-101629740559734.html

But the closure of Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport to commercial flights has held up deliveries, WHO regional emergency director Dr Richard Brennan told Reuters."While the eyes of the world now are on the people being evacuated and the planes leaving, we need to get supplies in to help those who are left behind," Brennan said in an emailed statement.Also Read | Afghanistan vulnerable to hunger, illness after Taliban takeover: WHO raises alarmHe said the WHO was calling for empty planes to divert to its warehouse in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), to collect the supplies on their way to pick up evacuees from Afghanistan.The United States (US) has enlisted six commercial airlines to help move Afghan evacuees, however, Washington and NATO coalition partners have so far indicated that they cannot bring supplies on incoming evacuation planes due to "operational constraints and security concerns", Brennan said."The US is using these commercial airlines only for evacuation," he said, adding that the WHO was exploring various options and reaching out to other governments."We have been advised to explore options at other airports such as Kandahar, Jalalabad and Bagram air bases. We do not yet have aircraft to fly even to those bases."The executive director of the UN children's agency UNICEF, Henrietta Fore, said on Monday around 10 million children across Afghanistan need humanitarian assistance and that conditions are expected to deteriorate further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabul-airport-curbs-blocking-medical-food-supplies-to-afghanistan-who-101629738599539.html
23-08-2021||World||Taliban name acting head of Afghan central bank to address ‘people’s problems’||More than a week after the Islamist insurgents Taliban swept Afghanistan’s capital Kabul with no or minimal resistance, the group has appointed one of its officials as the acting governor of the Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) – which is the country’s central bank — spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said on Twitter.Haji Mohammad Idris has been named the acting head of the DAB, even as the war-torn nation struggles with enormous economic turmoil with ATMs running out of cash and prices of essential items skyrocketing, Bloomberg reported.In his Twitter post, Mujahid stated that Idris will “address the looming banking issues and the problems of the people,” according to the translation by Bloomberg.Muhammad Jalal, a member of the Taliban’s cultural commission told Bloomberg over a text message that Idris headed the group’s economic commission in the past.In an interview with Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast, exiled central bank chief Ajmal Ahmady said that Afghanistan under Taliban faces an array of shocks that probably will result in weaker currency, capital controls and rapid inflation. He fled the country following the escape of other officials and leaders of Afghanistan, including former President Ashraf Ghani.Taliban fighters have been making swift movements towards Kabul by capturing provincial capitals – starting with minor ones to major hubs, till August 15. Soon after Kabul fell in their hands, Afghan nationals began to make a beeline at the Hamid Karzai International Airport to leave the country and their regime.Although the militants have, through its amnesty, assured that all Afghans will be safe and secured under their rule and that women and girls will be allowed to go to school as well as work, world leaders and organisations remain doubtful about the same.Idris’ appointment comes at a time when Afghani currency hit a record low last week, soon after the Taliban took over. Banks have reportedly been shut and prices of basic food items such as oil and flour have risen by as high as 35 per cent over the previous seven days. The Bloomberg report added that pharmacies and drugstores are also shut across Kabul, even as Mujahid said that the group’s fighters are patrolling the city to ensure security.Also Read | Taliban step up reprisals after promising amnestyA spokesperson of the Afghanistan finance ministry, Mohammad Rafi Tabe, told Bloomberg over phone that banks in the country will become “operational by tomorrow or the day after.”Tabe added though the finance minister left Afghanistan prior to the recapture of Kabul, the ministry is back to work and that all of its staff will function as per the same positions they had before the Taliban took over.Meanwhile, one of the extremist group’s officials, in an interview with Sky News in Doha, warned the US against delaying the deadline of August 31 for withdrawing its forces from Afghanistan. “If the US or UK were to seek additional time to continue evacuations – the answer is no. Or there would be consequences,” Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen was quoted as saying.Also Read | Afghanistan crisis: Taliban warn US of 'consequences' if August 31 deadline extendedHe further said that the extension is a “red line” and delaying the withdrawal of forces would mean “[America] is extending occupation while there is no need for that.”Shaheen said that if the US is intent on “continuing occupation” of Afghanistan, it will “provoke a reaction” from the Taliban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-name-acting-head-of-afghan-central-bank-to-address-people-s-problems-101629734026607.html
23-08-2021||World||US health agency fully approves Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine||The top US health agency on Monday granted full approval to Pfizer-BioNTech’s two-shot messenger RNA (mRNA) Covid-19 vaccine, making it the first for the United States.It will now retail as Comirnaty (koe-mir’-na-tee).Janet Woodcock, the acting head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), called the approval a “milestone”.“While this and other vaccines have met the FDA’s rigorous, scientific standards for emergency use authorisation (EUA), as the first FDA-approved Covid-19 vaccine, the public can be very confident that this vaccine meets the high standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality the agency requires of an approved product,” she said.The full authorisation will address reservations harboured by people who refused to be vaccinated citing EUA granted to all Covid-19 vaccines available in the United States thus far. It will allow the company to retail the vaccine more freely, through pharmacies and also advertise it.Pfizer-BioNTech s Covid-19 vaccine was the first to be used in the United States (it had been rolled out already in the United Kingdom and Canada), after the FDA granted it EUA on December 11, 2020 for people 16 years of age and older. Its rollout was a national event, reported breathlessly from the first truck that left the company’s plant in Portage, Michigan on December 13, to the administering of the first shot to a healthcare worker at a New York hospital on December 14.Since then, more than 204 million Pfizer shots have been administered, according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The EUA approval for Moderna’s two-shot vaccine, also based on mRNA technology followed shortly and then Johnson & Johnson’s one-shot vaccine. AstraZeneca’s vaccine, which is used in India as Covishield, has still not been authorised for use, not even emergency one.The FDA says it grants emergency use authorisation during public health emergencies to make available medical products that may be “effective in preventing, diagnosing, or treating a disease, provided that the FDA determines that the known and potential benefits of a product, when used to prevent, diagnose, or treat the disease, outweigh the known and potential risks of the product”.For full authorisation for Comirnaty, the FDA said it analysed data from about 20,000 vaccine and 20,000 placebo recipients between the ages of ages 16 and older who did not have evidence of the Covid-19 virus infection within a week of receiving the second dose.Its safety was evaluated in approximately 22,000 people who received the vaccine and 22,000 people who received a placebo 16 years of age and older, the agency said.The vaccine was found to be 91% effective in preventing Covid-19, according to the clinical trial data. More than half the participants of the clinical trial were followed for four months and an estimated 12,000 for six months.The most common side-effects of Comirnaty were pain, redness and swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle or joint pain, chills and fever. “The vaccine is effective in preventing Covid-19 and potentially serious outcomes including hospitalisation and death,” said the FDA.The agency also evaluated the data for myocarditis and pericarditis. It has been “determined that the data demonstrate increased risks, particularly within the seven days following the second dose”, the FDA said. The risk is higher among males under 40 compared to females and older males; and it was the highest in males 12 through 17 years of age.Though the data showed most individuals have had resolution of symptoms, some people had to be administered intensive care support, the agency said further. These risks will be included in the Comirnaty Prescribing Information. “Information is not yet available about potential long-term health outcomes,” the FDA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-health-agency-fully-approves-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-101629732146050.html
23-08-2021||World||FDA grants full approval to Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine||The coronavirus vaccine developed by American pharmaceutical firm Pfizer in partnership with Germany's BioNTech SE has been granted full approval in the United States, the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) said in a statement on Monday. The announcement follows reports from last week that the full approval may be granted soon.Also Read | Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine may get full approval in US next weekJanet Woodcock, the FDA's acting commissioner, described this as a "milestone" in the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic. "While millions have already safely received Covid-19 vaccines, we recognise that for some, an approval from us may now instill additional confidence to get vaccinated," Woodcock said.The full approval of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine candidate means that the jab can now be branded under the brand name of "Comirnaty." It also becomes the first shot to receive such an approval in the United States. Though the vaccine will continue to be available under Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) for children in the 12-15 age group, it may now be prescribed by physicians for children aged below 12 if they think it will be beneficial.FDA granted EUA to the jab on December 11 last year.In medical terms, a full approval is known as "biologics license application" (BLA). FDA approves EUA on the basis of results of an interim trial if it is of the opinion that benefits outweigh the risks. For BLA, on the other hand, data should be submitted only after the completion of clinical trials.The regulator's approval of Pfizer's submission for BLA was on the basis of an updated data from the vaccine's clinical trial, during which its safety and efficacy was evaluated among more than 40,000 participants.With the country witnessing a fresh surge of the coronavirus pandemic due to the Delta variant, authorities last week approved a Covid-19 booster shot, from September 20. According to Johns Hopkins University, the US has thus far seen more than 37 million Covid-19 cases and nearly 630,000 related fatalities, the highest globally on both counts.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-receives-full-approval-from-usfda-101629728250393.html
23-08-2021||World||Covid-19: Researchers identify antibody 'highly protective' against SARS-CoV-2 variants||Researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, claim to have identified an antibody which, they say, is "highly protective" against various variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, when delivered in low doses, news agency PTI has reported. For the study, the group immunised mice with the receptor-binding domain (RBD), a key part of a protein known as "spike." This protein is used by SARS-CoV-2 to attach itself to the respiratory tract of a human body, and to invade cells in it.The team then proceeded to extract antibody-producing cells, and obtained from them 43 antibodies which recognise RBD. These antibodies were then screened on the basis of how well these prevent the original SARS-CoV-2 virus from infecting cells kept in a dish. Separately, nine of the "most potent" antibodies were tested on mice to check if these could protect animals infected with the original SARS-CoV-2 strain. According to the researchers, multiple antibodies passed the test, with varying degrees of potency. Two of these, found to be the most effective at protecting the mice, were selected and tested on a range of variants which cause the viral disease.The variants included all four variants of concern (VoC) -- Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta -- and Kappa and Iota, both of which are variants of interest (VoI). Finally, the team found that one antibody, SARS2-38, "easily neutralised" all the six variants it was tested against, noting, in particular, the inability of the Beta variant to resist the antibody. This, they said, is "particularly remarkable" as the Beta variant is known for its resistance to antibodies. Speaking on the exercise, Michael S Diamond, a professor at the School of Medicine said, "Current antibodies may work against some variants, but not all. Since the virus is likely to continue to evolve, having broadly neutralising, effecting antibodies which work individually, and can also be paired to form new combinations, will likely prevent any resistance from the virus."The findings of the study were posted as a "pre-proof" in the journal Immunity. The results, according to the researchers, could help in the development of new antibody-based therapies likely to not lose potency as SARS-CoV-2 mutates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-researchers-identify-antibody-highly-protective-against-sars-cov-2-variants-101629720378721.html

One Chinese national suffered minor injuries and several local personnel were injured or killed,” Wang said on Monday.“We are shocked and condemn this incident, mourn the Pakistani personnel killed in the attack and convey sympathy to the bereaved families and injured,” he added.“We urge the Pakistan side to arrest the perpetrators and punish them as soon as possible,” Wang said.The Pakistani side has given proper treatment to the injured Chinese personnel, he said, adding that Islamabad said they will take every effort to ensure the safety of the Chinese personnel projects in Pakistan.“China will work with Pakistan to address the terrorist threats and protect the safety of our people and personnel in Pakistan.”“Terrorism,” Wang said, “is the common enemy of mankind. China opposes any force using terrorism to seek geopolitical interests and calls on all regional countries to collaborate in eradicating terrorist groups and upholding the common safety and development interests of all the countries in the region”.Friday’s attack comes a month after a suicide bomber attacked a bus carrying workers to a dam construction site in northern Pakistan, killing 13 people, including nine Chinese nationals.Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and ISI chief Faiz Hameed had rushed to China a week after the July attack.The frequent attacks on Chinese nationals and interests have cast a shadow over Chinese investment in Pakistan under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), one of the flagship projects under the Belt and Road Initiative.Beijing has invested billions in infrastructure projects in Pakistan as part of the CPEC, under its wider Belt and Road initiative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-must-arrest-those-behind-attack-that-injured-chinese-worker-foreign-min-101629720745972.html

It has lifted nearly 28,000 people since August 14 and 33,000 since July.The United States had planned to complete the evacuation of all American citizens, allies and Afghan partners by August 31, a deadline posted by Biden for ending America’s longest war.But those plans did not factor in the unexpectedly early collapse of the Kabul government. And the swift return of the Taliban triggered a rush on the airport of Afghans eager to flee the country, specially those who had worked with US and allied forces and now feared reprisal from the Taliban.Facing withering criticism of the chaotic evacuations, Biden has sought to reassure Americans no American or Afghan partner will be left behind, as the president indicated before in an interview to ABC, the US could stay beyond the August-end deadline.The US is also expanding the safe zone around the airport to allow easier access for Americans and Afghans trying to get inside amid reports massive crowd and efforts by Taliban fighters who are manning approach roads to prevent Afghans from leaving.“We have constantly - how can I say - increased rational access to the airport, where more folks can get there, more safely is still a dangerous operation but I don’t want to go into the detailed,” Biden said in response to a question, as he refused to divulge more details for security reasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-raises-possibility-of-us-staying-beyond-august-end-101629718524612.html

23-08-2021||World||Kamala Harris Asia tour: Singapore offers tanker aircraft to US for Afghan evacuation||Singapore on Monday offered America one of its tanker aircraft to airlift stranded civilians from war-torn Afghanistan, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said as he held talks with US Vice President Kamala Harris during which the two countries signed a number of key agreements to enhance cooperation, including in defence and cybersecurity.Vice President Harris' visit to Singapore is part of a diplomatic charm offensive by the Biden administration in Southeast Asia, a region that is crucial to the future prosperity and security of the United States, amidst China's aggressive actions in the region.Harris thanked Lee for the “very generous offer” to assist the US in its evacuations from Afghanistan.“We look forward to following up on that discussion,” she said.The A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft of the Singapore Air Force, which attained full operational capability in April, is capable of conducting air-to-air refuelling and airlift roles simultaneously.It enhances the Singapore Armed Forces' ability to contribute to international humanitarian assistance and disaster relief missions, and peace support operations.Lee, at a press conference held along with Harris, said that the safety and security of the civilians is on the minds of everyone all over the world, and that he hopes that all sides there can work to ensure this.The MRTT aircraft of the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) can carry up to 266 passengers or 37,000 kgs of cargo, and can be used to evacuate sick or injured personnel.“I mentioned to Vice President (Harris) that we knew that the US was conducting an evacuation operation of refugees from Afghanistan, and Singapore would like to offer to the US the use of (RSAF's MRTT) aircraft in order to help with the airlift,” said Lee.The US is evacuating Americans from Kabul which fell to the Taliban on August 15.Lee noted that Singapore is not unfamiliar with the challenges, and that the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) have deployed personnel there in support of the International Security Assistance Force (ISEF).The ISEF was an international military mission in Afghanistan, established by the United Nations Security Council, to train the Afghan National Security Forces and assist the country in rebuilding key government institutions.Singapore has sent personnel to Afghanistan because it is a key battlefront in the global fight against extremist terrorism, Lee said, noting that extremist ideas and capabilities have been exported from there to the region here.The Prime Minister said that the US’ intervention in the region 20 years ago has stopped terrorist groups from using Afghanistan as a safe base.“For this, Singapore is grateful. We hope Afghanistan does not become an epicentre for terrorism again,” he said.Meanwhile, the US and Singapore have signed three Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) to expand cooperation on cybersecurity in the public, defence and financial sectors.The MoUs were signed during the US Vice President’s official visit to Singapore, where she is looking to deepen bilateral cooperation in multiple areas, including defence and cybersecurity.The first MoU was signed by Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) chief executive David Koh and director of the US’ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Jen Easterly. It builds on a similar pact signed in 2016.This MoU will establish cooperation in areas like regular exchange of information on cyber threats, coordination of response to cybersecurity incidents, and joint cybersecurity training and exercises, the CSA said in a statement.It also covers mutual guidance on prevailing cybersecurity trends and best practices, joint cooperation in capacity building activities as well as raising cybersecurity awareness among respective constituents.Koh said Singapore and the US share “deep mutual interests” in improving cybersecurity cooperation, particularly as cybersecurity has become a “key enabler” for both countries to utilise the benefits of digitalisation to grow their economies and improve lives.Easterly said the borderless nature of cyber threats makes international collaboration a “key part” of the current US administration’s approach to cybersecurity.“The MoU allows us to strengthen our existing partnership with Singapore so that we can more effectively work together to collectively defend against the threats of today and secure against the risks of tomorrow,” she said.The CSA said the pact will expand into new areas of cooperation, like critical technologies as well as research and development.Separately, Singapore’s Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and the US’ Department of Defence also signed an MoU on cyberspace cooperation, aimed at institutionalising cyber cooperation between both defence establishments.Signed on August 20, the pact will improve cooperation in information sharing, ops-to-ops and technical exchanges, as well as collaboration in regional capacity building efforts."Such cooperation and engagements are professionally valuable, and help to build mutual understanding, and facilitate info-sharing and collaboration between trusted partners in capacity-building efforts," MINDEF said in a statement.The MoU concerning cooperation in cyberspace was signed by Chief of Defence Force Lieutenant-General Melvyn Ong, Commander of the United States Indo-Pacific Command Admiral John Aquilino and Commander of the US Cyber Command General Paul Nakasone.A third MoU on cybersecurity cooperation was signed between Singapore’s Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the US’ Department of the Treasury, aimed at maintaining and strengthening bilateral institutional ties.The agreement, signed on August 11, will cover information sharing related to the financial sector. This includes cybersecurity regulations and guidance, cybersecurity incidents, and cybersecurity threat intelligence.There will also be staff training and study visits, as well as competency-building activities including the conduct of cross-border cybersecurity exercises, the MAS said in a statement.Meanwhile, the US and Singapore have agreed to a partnership to better collaborate on climate action, environmental governance, sustainable development and low-carbon solutions.The US-Singapore Climate Partnership will "create opportunities for businesses and workers" in green growth sectors, including in energy transitions, clean energy infrastructure development, sustainable transport, sustainable finance and quality carbon credits markets, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI).Climate change is one area in which Harris is looking to deepen bilateral cooperation, senior US administration officials had earlier said. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic, cybersecurity, defence and digital trade are the others.In February, Singapore unveiled the Green Plan 2030, a "whole of nation movement" to advance sustainable development. One area of focus is growing the green economy to create new jobs, transform industries and use sustainability as a competitive advantage.The MTI called climate change a "critical global challenge" and a top priority for Singapore and the US, saying that sustainability and economic growth can go "hand in hand"."Both countries support global efforts to address this key challenge and are fully committed to implementing our commitments under the Paris Agreement and taking bold climate actions."By mainstreaming sustainability into the global economy, we can work together towards greater benefits and opportunities for Singapore, the US and the region,” it said.Potential areas of cooperation under the partnership include sustainable finance, energy transitions and quality carbon credit markets.Sustainable finance includes the use of private capital for sustainable infrastructure and environmental risk management in the financial sector, while energy transitions include sustainable transport.The partnership could also involve expert consultations on the setting of green standards and the management of environmental financial risks."Both countries will continue to explore opportunities to strengthen our collaboration in more areas of climate change and the green economy, in line with our mutual interests," the MTI said.Singapore and the US will also launch two new programmes next year on helping cities become more sustainable through the lowering of emissions.The programmes will improve knowledge sharing and collaboration between Singapore, US and other Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members through the ASEAN Smart Cities Network, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said in a statement."Upscaling green digital solutions will also maximise the benefits of technology from the digital revolution," the ministry added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-asia-tour-singapore-offers-tanker-aircraft-to-us-for-afghan-evacuation-101629709301914.html
23-08-2021||World||Afghanistan crisis: Taliban warn US of 'consequences' if August 31 deadline extended||The Taliban, which seized power in Afghanistan on August 15, have warned that the United States will see "consequences" in the event of an extension beyond August 31 on the stay of American troops in the war-torn nation, according to Hindustan Times' sister publication Live Hindustan. The development comes after US president Joe Biden, on Sunday, informed of discussions within his administration of possibly extending the deadline of the withdrawal of the US forces beyond August 31.Also Read | ‘Don’t trust anybody’, says Biden over Taliban’s promises towards AfghanistanAccording to Live Hindustan, the Islamist regime is treating August 31, which was announced by Biden earlier this year, as the "final" date by which all American troops deployed in Afghanistan will have been withdrawn. However, the US president, who has faced severe criticism over the ensuing chaos, is considering extending the deadline to facilitate evacuation missions from the Kabul airport, which, since the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan, has been thronged by Afghans desperate to leave their homeland.Also Read | Joe Biden says US-led evacuation from Kabul is acceleratingAlso, at an emergency meeting of the G7 convened by British prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday, the UK is likely to urge the US to extend the deadline.Also Read | 'Logical, right decision': Biden continues to defend US pullout from AfghanistanThe Taliban's "warning" to the US can be linked to previous reports that claimed that the extremists will not announce a new "government" till August 31 as per an "agreement" with the Biden administration. The insurgents captured Kabul last Sunday amid the ongoing withdrawal of the American soldiers from Afghanistan, thus seizing power for the second time. Earlier, they ruled from 1996-2001 but were then defeated by the US-led troops who arrived here following the 9/11 attacks. Since then, the Americans have been in Afghanistan for nearly two decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-warns-us-of-serious-consequences-if-august-31-deadline-extended-101629708133818.html
23-08-2021||World||Taliban flags proliferate as Afghan tricolour becomes resistance symbol||After two decades out of power, the Taliban are swiftly moving to stamp their authority on Afghanistan using every tool at their disposal -- including flags.Since rolling into Kabul a week ago, the white banner of the Islamist militants has become a common sight across the country, replacing the national tricolour flag above government buildings, police stations and military facilities.There have been scattered reports of people being castigated or even punished for waving the old national banner, but so far there is no official word from the group on the flag issue.At a Kabul roadside on Sunday, vendors were making a quick sale in Taliban flags -- a white banner bearing the Muslim proclamation of faith and the regime's formal name: "Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan"."Our goal is to spread the flag of the Islamic Emirate throughout Afghanistan, instead of the tricolour flag," said vendor Ahmad Shakib, who studies economics at university.It was not clear if he was affiliated with the Taliban.The sight of Taliban fighters in vehicles bearing the standard has terrorised people across Afghanistan in recent weeks as the militants first captured vast swathes of the rural hinterland and then all the major cities.The group was quick to replace the Afghan national flag wherever it could.But in the middle of the despair and fear sparked by the Taliban takeover, the old flag has become something of a symbol of defiance for many, featuring prominently in the small protests held in recent days.'My heart is here'Social media has been awash with images and emojis of the old flag -- a black, red and green vertical tricolour with the national emblem overlaid in white -- posted by public figures including sports stars and many ordinary Afghans.On Afghanistan's independence day last week, groups of people waved the national flag in Kabul and a handful of suburbs to celebrate -- sometimes in plain sight of patrolling Taliban.At one rally, people on a convoy of honking cars waved national flags in Kabul. At another spot, men and women stood by the roadside holding the tricolour banner.A day earlier, Taliban fighters fired guns to disperse dozens in the eastern city of Jalalabad who were protesting over the removal of the national flag, according to local media."My heart is here for this flag... I will never leave this flag," said one Jalalabad resident."Kill us, fire at us... We will never leave this flag."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-flags-proliferate-as-afghan-tricolour-becomes-resistance-symbol-101629702969216.html
23-08-2021||World||‘You’re not a cow or horse’: FDA warns against using Ivermectin to treat Covid||The US recently issued a strong warning against the use of Ivermectin to treat patients of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In a statement, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it has not approved Ivermectin for use in treating or preventing Covid-19 in humans as it is not a drug for treating viruses. “You are not a horse. You are not a cow. Seriously, y’all. Stop it,” the FDA was quoted as saying by Bloomberg on Saturday.The government body was sharply reacting towards the use of Ivermectin in Mississippi, the state worst hit by the Covid-19 pandemic across the United States. Several people were found using the drug to cure the viral disease. Mississippi’s health department issued a warning that over 70 per cent of the recent calls to the poison department were from people who took Ivermectin bought at livestock supply centres, Bloomberg further reported.What is Ivermectin?According to the US FDA’s website, Ivermectin tablets are approved to treat people who are suffering from intestinal strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis, two conditions caused by parasitic worms. Additionally, “some topical (on the skin) forms of ivermectin are approved to treat external parasites like head lice and for skin conditions such as rosacea,” the website said.Ivermectin is also used in animals such as horses and cows to prevent heartworm disease and specific internal and external parasites.However, it is important to note that Ivermectin used for treating animals is different when compared to using the drug for treating human beings. The FDA said the drug has been approved in only smaller doses for humans while it is given in high doses to animals. “Animal drugs are often highly concentrated because they are used for large animals like horses and cows, which can weigh a lot more than we do—a ton or more. Such high doses can be highly toxic in humans,” the FDA added.‘Ivermectin’ menace in MississippiAs mentioned earlier, Mississippi’s poison control centre has been seeing a rapid rise in calls where people have consumed Ivermectin- meant for treating animals, to treat the coronavirus disease. “The Mississippi Poison Control Center has received increased calls due to livestock or animal formulations of ivermectin taken to prevent or treat Covid-19 infection. Animal drugs are highly concentrated for large animals and can be highly toxic in humans. Do NOT take drugs made for animals in any form,” the department said in a Facebook post last Friday.The department also said that 85 per cent of the callers who took the drug had only mild symptoms but one person was “was instructed to seek further evaluation due to the amount of Ivermectin reportedly ingested.”Mississippi, apart from being the worst-hit state from Covid-19 across the United States, also has one of the lowest rates of vaccination. According to a report by ABC News, the state has been seeing a record surge in cases and hospitalisations. The Intensive Care Units (ICUs) are almost full to the brim.Even though the vaccination drive has picked up some speed in the state, only 45.1 per cent of the population has received the first vaccine dose compared to the national average of 60.5 per cent.(With Bloomberg inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/youre-not-a-cow-or-horse-fda-warns-against-using-ivermectin-to-treat-covid-101629703539607.html

23-08-2021||World||Taiwan rolls out first indigenous Covid vaccine amid criticism. All you need to know||Taiwan has developed its first indigenous vaccine against Covid-19, manufactured by biotechnology company Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corp. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen received her shot of the domestically-developed Covid-19 vaccine in capital Taipei on Monday. "It doesn't hurt, I'm in good spirits, and I'm going to continue working for the day," she later wrote on Facebook and gave it her stamp of approval.VIDEO: Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen receives a vaccine developed by Taiwanese firm Medigen - it's the island's first domestically developed Covid vaccine pic.twitter.com/FI0mrpbBeDThe vaccination program in the island nation was dependent on foreign-produced Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines till now.Read on to find out more about Medigen’s Covid-19 vaccine:1. The Taiwanese health ministry approved Medigen’s coronavirus vaccine for emergency use in July to reduce the country’s reliance on foreign manufactured vaccines, deliveries of which were marred by delays.2. Taiwan’s Food and Drug Administration said in an official statement that a 20 member panel had convened in July to approve the vaccine, but a two-member panel declined to approve the vaccine.3. The vaccine is yet to finish clinical trials and no efficacy data on it is available yet. The Taiwanese government has said studies conducted so far have shown that the vaccine works and the antibodies produced by it are three times higher than those produced by the AstraZeneca shot, reported Bloomberg.4. The shot has come under criticism who have alleged that the approval process was rushed. Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), mounted a fierce campaign to invalidate Medigen's authorisation by filing a lawsuit, which was rejected by a Taiwanese court last week.5. It is a recombinant protein vaccine that helps the body develop immunity by using the virus’ spike proteins. It belongs to the family of vaccines like Novovax and Covovax. Recombinant protein vaccines often require the use of adjuvants to generate a much stronger response.6. The Taiwanese government has said that citizens will have the freedom to choose their vaccines and no one will be forcibly administered Medigen’s indigenous jab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-rolls-out-first-indigenous-covid-vaccine-amid-criticism-all-you-need-to-know-101629699675109.html

The Taliban has sent hundreds of its fighters to the region, which is at the centre of the resistance against the insurgent group.Also Read: Taliban say 'hundreds of fighters' heading to Panjshir ValleyThe region is located 150 kilometres northeast of the capital Kabul, and hosts some senior members of the ousted government, like the deposed Vice President Amrullah Saleh, ex-Defence Minister Bismillah Mohammadi and National Resistance Front's Ahmad Massoud.Saleh has vowed to not bow before the Taliban, and has declared himself as the caretaker president since Ashraf Ghani fled Afghanistan. "Talibs have massed forces near the entrance of Panjshir a day after they got trapped in ambush zones of neighboring Andarab valley & hardly went out in one piece. Meanwhile Salang highway is closed by the forces of the Resistance. "There are terrains to be avoided". See you," he tweeted on Monday.Talibs have massed forces near the entrance of Panjshir a day after they got trapped in ambush zones of neighboring Andarab valley & hardly went out in one piece. Meanwhile Salang highway is closed by the forces of the Resistance. "There are terrains to be avoided". See you.The history of Panjshir Valley"Panjshir" means five lions. The name acknowledges a legend that says back in the 10th century, five brothers managed to contain the floodwaters. They built a dam for Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, it is said.Most of the valley's up to 150,000 inhabitants belong to the Tajik ethnic group, while the majority of the Taliban are Pashtuns.Saleh was born in Panjshir province and was trained there.Panjshir Valley has never been capturedThe resistance decided to make Panjshir Valley its base of operations because of the illustrious history - it was never captured by the Taliban during their earlier rule in the 1990s, nor by the Soviets a decade earlier.Also Read: What is Panjshir Resistance? 10 things to know about alliance against TalibanThe reason for that is the geographical advantage that Panjshir Valley has. Being tucked into the Hindu Kush mountain range, the valley can be accessed only through the narrow passage created by the Panjshir River, which makes it easier for the forces to defend it.The valley is also known for its emeralds, which were used in the past to finance the resistance movements against those in power.What happened after the withdrawal of the Soviets in 1989A civil war broke out in Afghanistan when the Soviets left, which the Taliban won. But Ahmad Shah Massoud, the country's most famed anti-Taliban fighter, launched a resistance against the Sunni Pashtun group and eventually succeeded in defending the Panjshir Valley.In fact, almost all of northeastern Afghanistan, up to the border with China and Tajikistan, was successfully defended by Massoud.He was assassinated by suspected al Qaeda terrorists in 2001.Son takes the batonAhmad Massoud, the son of Ahmad Shah, is now leading the resistance against the Taliban. He is joined by Saleh and other fighters from the region. Saleh has said that he will never betray the soul and legacy Ahmad Shah Massoud, who he called his "hero, the commander, the legend and the guide".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/panjshir-afghanistan-s-valley-of-resistance-remains-a-challenge-for-taliban-101629698923790.html

American and German forces are also involved in the gun battle and that all Bundeswehr members were uninjured, it added. There is no further information on who the attackers were as of now.Monday's incident took place after at least seven Afghans died in a panicked crush of people trying to enter Kabul’s international airport on Sunday, the British military said.After taking over the capital city, the Taliban are manning the outside perimeters of the Kabul airport. Thousands were still trying to flee the country in a chaotic exodus a week after the collapse of the Afghan government, leading to the Taliban military takeover.The United States and its allies withdrew troops from Afghanistan after a 20-year war aimed at overthrowing the Taliban and hunting down al Qaeda after the 9/11 attacks.The Biden administration had set August end as the deadline for the complete pullout of the troops, however, with the continuously evolving situation, the US President has said it could be extended. "We're executing a plan to move groups of these Americans to safety and to safely and effectively move them to the airport compound.

23-08-2021||World||Canada’s deputy PM in soup over controversial tweet||In the first major controversy of what has been a somewhat staid 2021 Federal election campaign so far, Twitter marked as manipulated media a tweet from Canada’s outgoing deputy prime minister, a post that was also retweeted by Liberal Party leader and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.The tweet from Chrystia Freeland, deputy prime minister and finance minister, took aim at Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole over the latter’s apparent preference for privatisation of Canada’s universal healthcare system, and she posted a video of a response from him to a question in this context. However, that video appears to have been spliced and was flagged by Twitter, but not before Trudeau had already retweeted it.Interestingly, while Freeland posted the same content in French and English, only the French version was flagged by Twitter. In the tweet, she wrote: “Canada’s public, universal health care system is one of our greatest strengths. It’s part of what makes us who we are as a country. Last year, as Covid-19 raged, Erin O’Toole was asked if he would bring private, “for-profit” healthcare to Canada. He responded unequivocally: “yes”.However, the person who asked him the question in July 2020, Kate Harrison responded to Freeland’s post stating she was “disappointed to see the video was manipulated to exclude important context”.“‘We need to ensure universal access remains paramount’. That’s a direct quote from O’Toole. It was edited from the original clip,” Harrison said.Another person, Laryssa Waler, posted a transcript of the original exchange, highlighting the parts that had been edited out of the clip that was posted by Freeland and accused her of trying to “mislead Canadians”.Harrison added, “The amateur cut and paste slapped together for this video is even more jarring when you look at what was used (and not used) in writing.”While still trailing the incumbent Liberals, the Conservative Party jumped on the opportunity afforded by Twitter’s action, unprecedented in Canadian politics, as it tweeted, “It’s disappointing to see the Liberals resort to American-style divisive politics. While Justin Trudeau and the Liberals are focused on spreading misinformation - Erin O’Toole is focused on Canada’s recovery plan and securing the future.”Trudeau is focusing upon healthcare, particularly his government’s measures to counter the challenge posted by the Covid-19 pandemic as the principal plank for the elections on September 20. In calling snap polls, his objective is to convert the minority that his party has in Parliament at this time into a majority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadas-deputy-pm-in-soup-over-controversial-tweet-101629694822611.html

This led to massive chaos in the country and the deaths of several residents seeking to flee Afghanistan. Biden and his administration have also come under backlash for not strategising well to prevent the fallout and causing a humanitarian crisis in the war-torn country.Both Republicans and Democrats have criticised Biden and suggested that his adamant decision to pull out from Afghanistan and disregard concerns that the Taliban was quickly advancing across Afghanistan created a humanitarian disaster.Former US envoy to the United Nations Nikki Haley criticised Biden earlier in the day, saying, "the US administration has surrendered the American people and actually withdrew our troops before they withdrew the American people." "They have abandoned our Afghan allies who kept people like my husband safe while they were overseas deploying. So, no, there was no negotiating. This was a complete and total surrender and an embarrassing failure," she added.Meanwhile, Biden has rejected the uproar and stood by his decision. During Sunday's press conference as well, Biden reiterated it was the time to leave Afghanistan and there wasn't a way to evacuate people without chaos. "There is no way to evacuate this many people without pain and loss and the heartbreaking images you see, it’s just a fact. My heart aches for those people you see. At the end of the day, if we didn't leave Afghanistan now, when would we?" he said.The US president also warned that with the Taliban now controlling the country, there is a threat of ISIS and its Afgan affiliate known as ISIS-K. "We know that terrorists may seek to exploit the situation and target innocent Afghans or American troops. We’re maintaining constant vigilance to monitor and disrupt threats from any source, including ISIS, ISIS-K," Biden also said at the White House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/logical-rational-and-right-decision-biden-continues-to-defend-us-pullout-as-situation-deteriorates-in-afghanistan-101629692989680.html

23-08-2021||World||US hires commercial airlines to help fly Afghanistan evacuees||The United States has enlisted the help of six commercial airlines to help transport people after their evacuation from Afghanistan as Washington seeks to step up the pace of departures of Americans and at-risk Afghans from Kabul.The Pentagon said on Sunday it called up 18 civilian aircraft from United Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air and others to carry people from temporary locations after they landed on flights from Afghanistan, leaning on the industry it last called on during the Iraq War in 2003.The move highlights the difficulty Washington is having carrying out the evacuations following the Taliban's swift takeover.Thousands of people remained outside the Kabul international airport on Sunday hoping to be evacuated as Taliban gunmen beat back crowds.“It’s a program that was designed in the wake of the Berlin airlift after World War Two to use commercial aircraft to augment our airlift capacity,” President Joe Biden said in an address from the White House on Sunday afternoon, adding that airlines voluntarily signed up for the program.Biden said the flights would bring people from "staging locations" like Qatar and Germany to the United States or a third country. He called it the initial stage of the program."None of them will be landing in Kabul," he said.American Airlines, Atlas Air, Delta Air Lines and privately held Omni Air will provide three aircraft each. There are also two from Hawaiian Airlines, and four from United Airlines.American and Delta said they would start relief flights on Monday and, along with other carriers, welcomed the call to aid the U.S. military amid the humanitarian crisis."American ... is proud to fulfill its duty to help the U.S. military scale this humanitarian and diplomatic rescue mission. The images from Afghanistan are heartbreaking," it said in a statement.Biden said the operation should have only a minimal effect on commercial flights.Delta said its commercial operations were unaffected, while American said it "will work to minimize the impact to customers as the airline temporarily removes these aircraft from our operation." United said it was still assessing the impact but expected it "to be minimal."Atlas Air said it would carry evacuees to the United States "and will be standing by should additional capacity be needed."'CIVIL RESERVE AIR FLEET'In the 12 hours up to 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Sunday, about 3,400 people were evacuated from Kabul on 39 coalition aircraft, including commercial airlines, and 1,700 others on eight U.S. military flights, according to the White House. Altogether, about 30,300 people have been evacuated since Aug. 14, it added.Bahrain's national carrier, Gulf Air, operated a flight from Isa Air Base to Dulles International Airport outside Washington as part of the evacuation efforts, Bahrain's government's media office, NCC, said on Sunday.The United States last utilized the "Civil Reserve Air Fleet" in the period leading up to and including the invasion of Iraq and prior to that, the 1991 Gulf War.The limited number of aircraft is just one of the issues facing the evacuation from Afghanistan that has evacuees being sent to a dozen countries.Officials have said they are also frustrated with slow processing by the Department of Homeland Security and State Department, and there is increasing concern about security in Kabul.The United States and its allies have brought in several thousand troops to manage the evacuations of foreign citizens and vulnerable Afghans, but have stayed away from areas outside of the Kabul airport.White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN the United States had "secured the capacity to get large numbers of Americans safe passage through the airport and onto the airfield" in Afghanistan, but gave no details.Last week, the U.S. military used three military helicopters to bring 169 Americans to the Kabul airport from a building just 650 feet (200 m) away. Officials say that type of operation is expected to continue.Biden said he directed the State Department to contact Americans stranded in Afghanistan by phone, email and other means and that the United States was “executing a plan” to move them to the Kabul airport.“I will say again today what I’ve said before: Any American who wants to get home will get home," Biden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hires-commercial-airlines-to-help-fly-afghanistan-evacuees-101629684952592.html

This Israeli study has answers||Data from Israel shows a booster shot of Pfizer Inc’s Covid-19 vaccine has significantly improved immunity and offered protection from serious illness among people aged 60 and above, as the US and other countries have announced plans to give additional doses amid the spread of highly infectious Delta variant.The United States has announced plans to offer booster shots to all Americans, citing data showing diminishing protection and Canada, France and Germany have also announced booster campaigns.Findings published by Israel’s health ministry showed on Sunday that the protection against infection provided from 10 days after a third dose was four times higher than after two doses among those aged 60 and over. It also showed that the third jab for over 60-year-olds offered five to six times greater protection after 10 days with regard to serious illness and hospitalisation. That age group is particularly vulnerable to Covid-19 and in Israel, it was the first to be vaccinated against Covid-19 when the inoculation drive began in late December.Also read | 'Don't have enough data': Dr Guleria on if Covid vaccine booster needed in IndiaThe data were presented at a meeting of a ministry panel of vaccination experts on Thursday and uploaded to its website on Sunday. However, the full details of the study have not been released.Last week, Maccabi Health Services, one of several organisations administering booster shots to try to curb the Delta variant, also had similar findings with separate statistics.Maccabi Health Services in a study released last Wednesday said that the booster shot reduced the risk of infection in the 60-plus age group by 86 per cent and against severe infection by 92 per cent. The findings by Maccabi are based on real-world data from a relatively large group. Pfizer and Moderna Inc have also said their own studies showed a booster shot would improve protection.Also read | US CDC delays review of Covid booster shots as debate swirls over third jabIsrael’s health ministry has said that immunity has diminished over time for the elderly in the country as well as the young. Most vaccinated people who fell severely ill in Israel were over 60 and had underlying health conditions.Israel started administering the third dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to those over 60-year-olds on July 30. It has now revised the age of eligibility for a booster to 40 and also said that pregnant women, teachers and health care workers below that age can also get the third shot. Third doses are given only to those who received their second shot at least five months ago.Israel, which has been fighting an outbreak of the Delta variant since June, has one of the world's highest infection rates per capita. Close to 1.5 million people out of the country's 9.3 million population have taken the third jab. Israel was the first country to fully vaccinate a majority of its citizens against Covid-19. (With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/do-covid-19-vaccine-boosters-help-this-israeli-study-has-answers-101629681354244.html
23-08-2021||World||Joe Biden says US-led evacuation from Kabul is accelerating||President Joe Biden said Sunday the U.S.-led evacuation of Americans, at-risk Afghans and others from the Kabul airport accelerated this weekend, although it remains vulnerable to threats posed by the Islamic State extremist group.One week after the Taliban completed its takeover of Afghanistan by capturing Kabul, Biden said discussions are underway among military officials about potentially extending the airlift beyond Biden's Aug. 31 deadline. “Our hope is we will not have to extend, but there are discussions,” he said, suggesting the possibility that the Taliban will be consulted.Since Aug. 14, one day before the Taliban entered Kabul, the airlift has evacuated 28,000 people, Biden said. He said that included 11,000 who had departed from Kabul in a 36-hour period this weekend, but he did not provide details. The number appeared to include flights by charter and non-U.S. military aircraft as well as the U.S. Air Force C-17 and C-130 transport planes that have been flying daily from the capital. The U.S. military is controlling air traffic on both the civilian and military sides of the airport.Tens of thousands of people remain to join the airlift, which has been slowed by security issues and U.S. bureaucracy hurdles.Biden asserted, without a full explanation, that U.S. forces have managed to improve access to the airport for Americans and others seeking to get on flights. He suggested that the perimeter had been extended, widening a “safe zone.”“What I’m not going to do is talk about the tactical changes we’re making to make sure we maintain as much security as we can," he said. "We have constantly, how can I say it, increased rational access to the airport, where more folk can get there more safely. It's still a dangerous operation but I don’t want to go into the detail of how we’re doing that.”Later Biden added: “We've discussed a lot with the Taliban. They’ve been cooperative in extending some of the perimeter.”He said groups of Americans in Kabul are being moved more efficiently and safely to the airport, but he provided no details.“Any American who wants to get home, will get home,” he asserted.Earlier Sunday, administration officials said the U.S. military is considering “creative ways” to get Americans and others into the Kabul airport for evacuation from Afghanistan amid “acute” security threats, and the Pentagon on Sunday ordered six U.S. commercial airlines to help move evacuees from temporary sites outside of Afghanistan.Addressing a criticism cited by many Republicans, Biden said no Afghan evacuees are being flown directly to the United States from Afghanistan without prior screening. He said they are being screened in third countries.Biden and his top aides have repeatedly cited their concern that extremist groups in Afghanistan will attempt to exploit the chaos around the Kabul airport.“The threat is real, it is acute, it is persistent and something we’re focused with every tool in our arsenal," said Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan.Sullivan said on CNN's “State of the Union” that 3,900 people had been airlifted out of Kabul on U.S. military flights over the past 24 hours. A U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to provide details not yet made public, said those people were flown on a total of 23 flights — 14 by C-17 transports and nine aboard C-130 cargo planes.That represents an increase from 1,600 flown out aboard U.S. military planes in the previous 24 hours, but remains far below the 5,000 to 9,000 that the military says it has the capacity to airlift daily. Sullivan also said about 3,900 people were airlifted on non-U.S. military flights over the past 24 hours.The Biden administration has given no firm estimate of the number of Americans seeking to leave Afghanistan. Some have put the total between 10,000 and 15.000. Sullivan on Sunday put it at “several thousand.”Speaking on ABC’s “This Week,” Austin said that as Biden’s Aug. 31 deadline for ending the evacuation operation approaches, he will recommend whether to give it more time. Tens of thousands of Americans and others have yet to be flown out of the country.Austin’s interview with ABC aired Sunday but was taped Saturday. In a notice Sunday, the State Department urged people seeking to leave Afghanistan as part of an organized private evacuation effort not come to the Kabul airport “until you have received specific instructions” to do so from the U.S. Embassy’s flight organizer. The notice said that others, including American citizens, who have received specific instructions from the embassy to make their way to the airport should do so.Austin said the airlift would continue for as long as possible.“We’re gonna try our very best to get everybody, every American citizen who wants to get out, out,” Austin said in the interview. “And we’ve got -- we continue to look at different ways to -- in creative ways -- to reach out and contact American citizens and help them get into the airfield.”The British military said Sunday another seven people had been killed in the unceasing crush of crowds outside the airport.Republicans in Congress stepped up their criticism of Biden's response. “If the Taliban is saying that Americans can travel safely to the airport, then there is no better way to make sure they get safely to the airport than to use our military to escort them,” GOP Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, an Army veteran, said on ABC's “This Week.”Ryan Crocker, who served as U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan under Presidents George W, Bush and Barack Obama, told CBS' “Face the Nation” that Biden’s management of the withdrawal was “catastrophic” and had unleashed a “global crisis.”A central problem in the evacuation operation is processing evacuees once they reach other countries in the region and in Europe. Those temporary waystations, including in Qatar, Bahrain and Germany, are sometimes reaching capacity, although new sites are being made available, including in Spain.In an attempt to alleviate that, and to free up military aircraft for missions from Kabul, the Pentagon on Sunday activated the Civil Reserve Air Fleet. The Defense Department said 18 aircraft from American Airlines, Atlas Air, Delta Air Lines, Omni Air, Hawaiian Airlines and United Airlines will be directed to ferry evacuees from interim waystations. The airlines will not fly into Afghanistan. The six participating airlines have agreed to assist for a little less than two weeks, which roughly coincides with the currently planned duration of the airlift, which is to end Aug. 31.The civil airline reserve system was last activated in 2003 for the Iraq War. The commercial airliners will retain their civilian status but the military's Air Mobility Command will control the flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-us-led-evacuation-from-kabul-is-accelerating-101629678979649.html

The tweet came along with a 14-second video clip showing a column of captured trucks with the white Taliban flags moving along a highway.مئات من مجاهدي #الإمارة_الإسلامية يتوجهون نحو ولاية #بنجشير للسيطرة عليها، بعد رفض مسئولي الولاية المحليين تسليمها بشكل سلمي. pic.twitter.com/FwAYBZeopqMassoud, the son of Ahmad Shah Massoud, one of the main leaders of Afghanistan's anti-Soviet resistance in the 1980s, said his supporters were ready to fight if the Taliban tried to invade the Panjshir Valley. "We want to make the Taliban realise that the only way forward is through negotiation. We do not want a war to break out,” he told Reuters by telephone from his stronghold in the Panjshir Valley northwest of Kabul.He and Amrullah Saleh, the country's vice president, have gathered forces made up of remnants of regular army units and special forces as well as local militia fighters. "They want to defend, they want to fight, they want to resist against any totalitarian regime,” he told Reuters.Also read | 'If Taliban launch a full-scale attack on Panjshir...': What analysts sayReuters reported that there was some uncertainty about whether the Taliban have begun their operation.

The Taliban only need to lock down the Panjshir, they don't even have to go in there,” Dorronsoro told news agency AFP.

23-08-2021||World||Henri soaks New England with rain, wind after roaring ashore||Tropical Storm Henri, downgraded at sea from a hurricane, is soaking the U.S. Northeast with rain after it came ashore in Rhode Island. The storm is leaving a trail of power outages and flooded roadways from New Jersey to Massachusetts.Henri drove the ocean 1-to-2 feet (30-to-60 centimeters) higher as it made landfall near Westerly, Rhode Island, with top winds of 60 miles (95 kilometers) per hour. It was southeast of Hartford Connecticut at 5 p.m. local time, lumbering along at 7 miles an hour, according to the National Hurricane Center. “While New Englanders are used to dealing with some tough weather, this storm has the potential for widespread consequences throughout the region, with significant flooding and power outages,” President Joe Biden said at a news conference at the White House Saturday afternoon. “We don’t know the full extent of the storm’s impact today, but we’re acting to prepare for and prevent damage as much as possible.”Henri is the latest in a grim parade of extreme weather events worldwide as climate change takes hold. Massive wildfires have blackened huge swaths of California, Greece, Algeria and Siberia, sending smoke over the North Pole for the first time on record. July was the hottest month ever recorded on Earth.And in a separate major event, heavy rain fell across western and central Tennessee late Friday into Saturday, dropping as much as 17.02 inches (43 centimeters) in McEwen, a small town west of Nashville, said Brian Hurley, a senior branch forecaster at the U.S. Weather Prediction Center. At least 22 people died in the resulting floods, according to the Associated Press.Henri is the fifth storm to hit the U.S. in 2021 and the eighth to form in the Atlantic. Henri is expected to linger across southern New England bringing as much as 6 inches of rain to a landscape that has been drenched by weeks of downpours. It will then sweep across southern Maine and head for the Canadian Maritimes.Flooding has been reported across the Northeast, disrupting transportation. Amtrak canceled trains between New York and Boston. Some subway tunnels were inundated in New York City. And about 1,000 flights were canceled as of 11 a.m., mostly in Boston and Newark, New Jersey, according to Flight Aware, an airline tracking service. More than 125,000 homes and businesses are without power across the region, according to Poweroutage.us, which tracks outages. More than 13,500 utility workers from dozens of states are on standby to help restore power, according to the Edison Electric Institute, a utility trade group. As early as Sunday morning, Henri was still a hurricane, with top winds of 75 mph. But it lost power on its final approach. “It didn’t come in as ferocious as predicted,” said Jim Rouiller, lead meteorologist at the Energy Weather Group. “I was expecting a bit more out of it but it really hasn’t materialized.”A continental storm coming across Pennsylvania seems to have sapped some of Henri’s energy and moisture, Rouiller said. It also helped slow Henri down as it crossed an area of cooler water that robbed it of its strength.Hurricanes and tropical storms depend on warm ocean water to build power and maintain strength. The cooler water has just the opposite effect and that could mean that the feared flooding and power outage won’t be as bad.But flooding could still be severe, and officials braced for the worst. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Saturday declared a state of emergency, and thousands of residents and holiday-makers evacuated beach communities -- or in some cases, opted to hunker down. A mandatory evacuation order was issued for some residents nearest the coast in Madison, Connecticut, across Long Island Sound. President Biden approved emergency declarations for Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York and ordered federal assistance. He authorized the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate all disaster relief efforts. The Coast Guard ordered ports in Southeastern New England to shut, and established a safety zone for the Port of Narragansett, Mount Hope, Buzzards Bay, and Cape Cod Bay. In New York and New Jersey, authorities will implement vessel traffic control measures and limit movement.Henri probably won’t produce anywhere near the $77 billion in damages that Superstorm Sandy caused in 2012, but it poses a significant threat to transportation and power networks, and is set to unleash potentially deadly storm surges.The winds, rain and surge damage could reach at least $1 billion in losses, said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research. Many of those costs will be absorbed by residents, who will make repairs themselves or because the damage won’t reach insurance deductibles. Insured losses will probably top out at $500 million, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/henri-soaks-new-england-with-rain-wind-after-roaring-ashore-101629675264059.html
23-08-2021||World||22 dead, many missing after 17 inches of rain in Tennessee||At least 22 people were killed and rescue crews searched desperately Sunday amid shattered homes and tangled debris for dozens of people still missing after record-breaking rain sent floodwaters surging through Middle Tennessee.Saturday's flooding in rural areas took out roads, cellphone towers and telephone lines, leaving families uncertain about whether their loved ones survived the unprecedented deluge. Emergency workers were searching door to door, said Kristi Brown, a coordinator for health and safety supervisor with Humphreys County Schools.Many of the missing live in the neighborhoods where the water rose the fastest, Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis said. Their names were on a board in the county’s emergency center and listed on a city department's Facebook page.“I would expect, given the number of fatalities, that we’re going to see mostly recovery efforts at this point rather than rescue efforts," Tennessee Emergency Management Director Patrick Sheehan said.The dead included twin toddlers who were swept from their father’s arms, according to surviving family members, and a foreman at county music star Loretta Lynn's ranch. The sheriff of the county of about 18,000 people some 60 miles (96 kilometers) west of Nashville said he lost one of his best friends.Up to 17 inches (43 centimeters) of rain fell in Humphreys County in less than 24 hours Saturday, shattering the Tennessee record for one-day rainfall by more than 3 inches (8 centimeters), the National Weather Service said.Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee toured the area, calling it a “devastating picture of loss and heartache." He stopping on Main Street in Waverly where some homes were washed off their foundations and people were sifting though their water-logged possessions. All around the county were debris from wrecked cars, demolished businesses and homes and a chaotic, tangled mix of the things inside.Shirley Foster cried as the governor walked up. She said she just learned a friend from her church was dead.“I thought I was over the shock of all this. I’m just tore up over my friend. My house is nothing, but my friend is gone,” Foster told the governor.The hardest-hit areas saw double the rain that area of Middle Tennessee had in the previous worst-case scenario for flooding, meteorologists said. Lines of storms moved over the area for hours, wringing out a record amount of moisture — a scenario scientists have warned may be more common because of global warming.The downpours rapidly turned the creeks that run behind backyards and through downtown Waverly into raging rapids. Business owner Kansas Klein stood on a bridge Saturday in the town of 4,500 people and saw two girls who were holding on to a puppy and clinging to a wooden board sweep past, the current too fast for anyone to grab them. He hadn't found out what happened to them.Not far from the bridge, Klein told The Associated Press by phone that dozens of buildings in a low-income housing area known as Brookside appeared to have borne the brunt of the flash flood from Trent Creek.“It was devastating: buildings were knocked down, half of them were destroyed,” Klein said. “People were pulling out bodies of people who had drowned and didn’t make it out.”The Humphreys County Sheriff Office Facebook page filled with people looking fo r missing friends and family. GoFundMe pages were made asking for help for funeral expenses for the dead, including 7-month-old twins yanked from their father’s arms as they tried to escape.The foreman at Lynn's ranch, Wayne Spears, also was killed.“He’s out at his barn and next thing you know, he goes from checking animals in the barn to hanging on in the barn to people seeing him floating down the creek. And that’s how fast it had come up," the sheriff said.A photo taken by someone at the ranch showed Spears in a cowboy hat clinging to a pillar in brown, churning water up to his chest.“Wayne’s just one of those guys, he just does everything for everybody, if there’s a job to do,” said his friend Michael Pate, who met Spears at the ranch 15 years ago.At the Cash Saver grocery in in Waverly, employees stood on desks, registers and a flower rack as the waters from the creek that's usually 400 feet (120 meters) from the store rushed in after devastating the low income housing next door. At one point, they tried to break through the celling into the attic and couldn't, store co-owner David Hensley said.The flood waters stopped rising as fast just as the situation was getting dire and a rescue boat came by. “We told him that if there’s somebody else out there you can get, go get them, we think we’re OK,” Hensley said.At the beginning of a news conference on Tropical Storm Henri's impact on New England, President Joe Biden offered condolences to the people of Tennessee and directed federal disaster officials to talk with the governor and offer assistance.Just to the east of Waverly, the town of McEwen was pummeled Saturday with 17.02 inches (43.2 centimeters) of rain, smashing the state’s 24-hour record of 13.6 inches (34.5 centimeters) from 1982, according to the National Weather Service in Nashville, though Saturday’s numbers would have to be confirmed.A flash flood watch was issued for the area before the rain started, with forecasters saying 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters) of rain was possible. The worst storm recorded in this area of Middle Tennessee only dropped 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain, said Krissy Hurley, a weather service meteorologist in Nashville.“Forecasting almost a record is something we don’t do very often,” Hurley said. “Double the amount we’ve ever seen was almost unfathomable.”Recent scientific research has determined that extreme rain events will become more frequent because of man-made climate change. Hurley said it is impossible to know its exact role in Saturday’s flood, but noted in the past year her office dealt with floods that used to be expected maybe once every 100 years in September south of Nashville and in March closer to the city.“We had an incredible amount of water in the atmosphere,” Hurley said of Saturday’s flooding. “Thunderstorms developed and moved across the same area over and over and over.”The problem isn’t limited to Tennessee. A federal study found man-made climate change doubles the chances of the types of heavy downpours that in August 2016 dumped 26 inches (66 centimeters) of rain around Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Those floods killed at least 13 people and damaged 150,000 homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/22-dead-many-missing-after-17-inches-of-rain-in-tennessee-101629675158003.html
23-08-2021||World||Tropical storm closes in on US coast||Tropical Storm Henri steamed towards the northeastern US coastline on Sunday morning, packing high winds and heavy rains that were projected to leave a wide swath of devastation from New Jersey and New York to Massachusetts.The storm was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm but still packed wind gusts of up to 120kmph. Officials warned of the danger of widespread flooding in inland areas as the storm was expected to sweep west from the coast before turning back to the Northeast. Millions on New York’s Long Island and in southern New England braced for the possibility of flooding, toppled trees and power outages.10 killed in Tennessee floods, dozens missingFlooding in Middle Tennessee left at least ten people dead and dozens missing on Saturday as record-shattering rainfall washed away homes and rural roads, authorities said.Hurricane Grace kills 8 including kids in MexicoHurricane Grace killed at least eight people, including five children from the same family, as it tore through eastern Mexico on Saturday, causing flooding, mudslides and damage to homes and businesses.The storm made landfall in Mexico for a second time near Tecolutla in Veracruz state as a major Category Three storm with winds of 200kmph.It later fizzled out as it moved inland over the central highlands, but not before causing widespread damage. In the Veracruz state capital, Xalapa, streets were turned into muddy brown rivers. Seven people died there and one more in the city of Poza Rica, Veracruz governor Cuitlahuac Garcia said. The victims included a mother and five of her children, who were buried when a hillside collapsed on their small home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-closes-in-on-us-coast-101629661691091.html
23-08-2021||World||Airport in Kabul still tense as 7 die in panicked crush||At least seven Afghans died in a panicked crush of people trying to enter Kabul’s international airport since the Taliban takeover, the British military said on Sunday, as thousands were still trying to flee the country in a chaotic exodus.The Taliban moved to confront the first stirrings of armed resistance since capturing nearly all of Afghanistan in a matter of days earlier this month. Anti-Taliban fighters claimed to have seized three mountainous districts, and a prominent militia commander in the only province not yet under Taliban control pledged to fight back if attacked.The British military on Sunday acknowledged at least seven deaths at the airport. Others may have been trampled, suffocated or suffered heart attacks as Taliban fighters fired into the air to try to drive back the crowds. Soldiers covered several corpses in white clothing.A Nato official said at least 20 people have died in the past seven days in and around the airport. Some were shot and others died in stampedes, witnesses have said. “The situation at Kabul airport remains extremely challenging and unpredictable,” the Nato official said.Kabul’s airport has seen days of chaos since the Taliban entered the capital on August 15.
