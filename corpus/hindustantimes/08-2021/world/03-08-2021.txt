Other cities quickly organised to join the chant from their homes in the evenings, as a message of support for embattled security forces.Clashes between Afghan forces and the Taliban have intensified across the country with the insurgent group gaining control over check points, trading posts and infrastructure projects.The Taliban said their fighters in Kabul killed a district governor of central Maidan Wardak province on Tuesday, the latest in a series of killings by the insurgent group aimed at eliminating senior government officials and social activists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/powerful-explosion-gunfire-hit-kabul-civilians-protest-against-taliban-101628011189312.html
03-08-2021||World||Boeing postpones Starliner capsule test flight to space due to glitch||Boeing Co on Tuesday postponed the planned launch of its CST-100 Starliner capsule from Florida's Cape Canaveral bound for the International Space Station due to a glitch in what was to have been a crucial do-over test flight following a near-catastrophic failure during its 2019 debut.During pre-launch preparations, Boeing engineers detected "unexpected valve position indications" in its propulsion system, Boeing said in a statement. The problem was detected during checks after electrical storms in the region, Boeing added."We're disappointed with today's outcome and the need to reschedule our Starliner launch," said John Vollmer, the program's manager. "Human spaceflight is a complex, precise and unforgiving endeavor, and Boeing and NASA teams will take the time they need to ensure the safety and integrity of the spacecraft and the achievement of our mission objectives."The Starliner capsule loaded with supplies had been scheduled to have blasted off atop an Atlas V rocket flown by the United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp, at 1:20 p.m. EDT (1720 GMT) from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.The launch had been planned for last Friday, but was postponed by NASA after the space station was briefly thrown out of control with seven crew members aboard, a mishap caused by the inadvertent reignition of jet thrusters on a newly docked Russian service module. Russia's space agency blamed a software glitch.Tuesday's planned uncrewed mission was intended as a precursor to a closely watched crewed flight potentially to be conducted before the end of the year. It was to be a key trial for the U.S. aerospace giant after back-to-back crises - a pandemic that crushed demand for new planes and a safety scandal caused by two fatal 737 MAX crashes - that have damaged Boeing's finances and engineering reputation.Atlas V's dual Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10A-4-2 engines were poised to send Starliner on a 113-mile (98 nautical miles/181 km) suborbital trajectory before the capsule separates and flies under its own power to the space station in a roughly 24-hour overall journey.The Starliner capsule headlined Boeing's efforts against billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX to be the first to return NASA astronauts to the space station from U.S. soil in nearly a decade.But a series of software glitches during the December 2019 debut launch resulted in its failure to dock at the orbital laboratory outpost. SpaceX's Crew Dragon has gone on to launch three crewed space station missions since 2020, with a fourth slated as early as Oct. 31, according to NASA.Boeing has spent a year and a half correcting issues flagged during NASA reviews, part of the U.S. space agency's strategy to ensure access to the sprawling international research satellite some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.NASA in 2014 awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to build their own capsules that could fly American astronauts to the space station in an effort to wean the United States off its dependence on Russia's Soyuz vehicles for rides to space following the end of NASA's space shuttle program in 2011. If all goes well, Boeing will bring the capsule home on Aug. 9, and then attempt the follow-on crewed mission that the company has said will take place no earlier than December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boeing-postpones-starliner-capsule-test-flight-to-space-due-to-glitch-101628005743309.html

A 165-page long report probing the sexual harassment allegations against Cuomo revealed that the governor’s “sexually harassing behaviour” was not limited to members of his own staff members but extended to other State employees.“This is a sad day for New York because independent investigators have concluded that Governor Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women and, in doing so, broke the law,” James said in a statement.After James appointed the investigative team in early March, the investigators interviewed 179 people and took testimony under oath from 41 of them. These included women who have accused Cuomo of sexual harassment and other inappropriate conduct. The investigators, led by Joon H. Kim and Anne L. Clark, found that Cuomo and his aides retaliated against at least one former employee for coming forward with her story.A woman, identified in the report as Executive Assistant #1, said that the governor’s behaviour ranged from "playful banter" about her potential romantic relationships to asking about her social and dating lives. Over time, the report said, Cuomo's behaviour escalated to more intimate physical contact, culminating in an incident where the governor reached under her “blouse and grabbed her breast.”“I am grateful to all the women who came forward to tell their stories in painstaking detail, enabling investigators to get to the truth. No man — no matter how powerful — can be allowed to harass women or violate our human rights laws, period,” James added.The report said that the Executive Chambered fostered a “toxic” workplace that enabled “harassment to occur and created a hostile work environment.” While the investigators find his actions and those of the Executive Chamber violated multiple state and federal laws, they have not suggested any punishment for the governor in the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-governor-andrew-cuomo-sexually-harassed-multiple-women-probe-finds-101628008205788.html

Citing the data from the United Nations, the White House said in a statement that the number of doses donated by the US is more than the donations of all other countries combined which “cements the United States as the global leader in Covid-19 vaccine donations.”US President Joe Biden has promised the country will be an “arsenal of vaccines” for the world amid fear of inequitable vaccine distribution in low- and lower-middle-income countries. Biden is expected to discuss the milestone later Tuesday, providing an update on his administration’s strategy to stop the spread of Covid-19 abroad.Indonesia, the Philippines, Pakistan, Bangladesh and South Africa received the largest chunk of the vaccines donated by the US. While Pakistan and Bangladesh received 5.5 million Covid-19 vaccines each, Indonesia received 8 million vaccines. The Philippines and South Africa are also major beneficiaries, getting 6.2 million and 5.6 million shots respectively.The White House stressed that these donations will not be used to secure favours from other countries. “The Administration looks at a variety of factors, including Covid-19 case rates, death rates, and hospitalizations; current vaccination rates; responses to surges; and a country’s ability to receive vaccines and put shots into arms,” it added.The United States has made the vaccine donations largely through a global vaccine program called COVAX. The White House stated that the US will start shipping 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccine at the end of August that it has pledged to donate to 100 low-income countries by June 2022.The announcement comes as the US has started witnessing a fresh surge in infections, mostly among the unvaccinated. The administration is encouraging states to incentivise people to get vaccinated against Covid-19 since vaccine hesitancy has slowed down the inoculation drive, especially in the southern states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-indonesia-among-biggest-beneficiaries-of-over-110-mn-vaccines-donated-by-us-101628004456335.html

(and) didn't seem remorseful".Intelligence shared by prison authorities with police four months before the attack in October 2019 also suggested he was involved in radicalising other inmates there.Britain passed emergency laws last year to stop convicted terrorists from being automatically released part-way through their prison sentences following Amman's rampage and a deadly knife attack near London Bridge in November 2019.In that prior incident Usman Khan, 28, stabbed two people to death while attending a prisoner rehabilitation programme less than a year after he had been released from jail under strict conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-attacker-had-vowed-to-kill-the-queen-join-isis-101628000817149.html

It will be the Starliner's second unmanned test flight. Boeing’s spacecraft will carry more than 400 pounds of cargo and crew supplies to the space station and return to the Earth with more than 550 pounds of cargo, according to Nasa.The spacecraft will blast off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket at 1.20pm EDT (10.50pm IST) on August 3. Nasa said that the Starliner will start performing its orbital insertion burn about 30 minutes after the launch. The spacecraft is scheduled to dock at the space station at 1.37pm EDT (11.07pm IST) on Wednesday.Orbital Flight Test-2 (OFT-2) is aimed at demonstrating the end-to-end capabilities of the capsule-and-rocket combo, from launch, docking and landing in the western United States.Also Read | Perseids meteor shower to light up night skies in August. When and how to watchThe launch was earlier scheduled for Friday last week but an incident throwing the space station out of control forced the mission controllers to reschedule it. An unplanned firing of jet thrusters of the Russian research module due to a “short-term software failure” knocked the ISS off its course causing a “loss of attitudinal control” that lasted for a little more than 45 minutes. Nasa assured that ground teams restored the attitudinal control and orientation of the space station by activating thrusters on another module attached to it."The crew is now busy balancing the pressure in the Nauka module. In the afternoon, the crew will open the hatches, enter the module, turn on the necessary means of purifying the atmosphere and begin normal regular work," Vladimir Solovyov, designer general at Energia, a Russian space agency company, had said in a statement.The launch and docking activities for the Boeing OFT-2 will be aired live on Nasa TV and its website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-boeing-oft-2-mission-with-starliner-atlas-v-rocket-set-for-launch-101627990720934.html

Stanford University astrophysicist Dan Wilkins and his colleagues were observing X-rays released by a supermassive black hole 800 million light-years away when the telescopes recorded additional flashes of X-rays smaller and of different colours than the bright flares.“Any light that goes into that black hole doesn’t come out, so we shouldn’t be able to see anything that’s behind the black hole,” Wilkins, the author of the study, said in a statement.While the bright flares are not an unusual phenomenon, the X-rays reflecting from behind the black hole was a strange discovery. Material falling into a supermassive black hole gets superheated due to the enormous gravity around it, powering continuous sources of light in the universe by forming corona.Also Read | Researchers observe never before seen short gamma-ray burst from collapsing starWhen the electrons separate from atoms at such a high temperature, a magnetic plasma is created. The magnetic field breaks as it arch high above the black hole and then bends towards it, producing high energy electrons that subsequently produce the X-rays. Researchers determined that the series of smaller flashes were the same X-ray flares but reflected from behind the black hole.“I’ve been building theoretical predictions of how these echoes appear to us for a few years,” said Wilkins. “I’d already seen them in the theory I’ve been developing, so once I saw them in the telescope observations, I could figure out the connection.”The study, published late last month in the journal Nature, is the first direct observation of light from behind a black hole."Fifty years ago, when astrophysicists starting speculating about how the magnetic field might behave close to a black hole, they had no idea that one day we might have the techniques to observe this directly and see Einstein’s general theory of relativity in action,” said Roger Blandford, a co-author of the paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-strange-discovery-scientists-detect-light-behind-black-hole-for-first-time-101627985533999.html

However, the whistleblower succumbed to the viral disease in February last year, leading to widespread public anger against the government.China has so far reported 93,193 cases, 4,636 deaths and 87,400 recoveries due to Covid-19. However, the real figures could be much higher than the official data. On Tuesday, the country reported 90 new Covid-19 cases, compared to 98 a day earlier, according to the National Health Commission. And of Tuesday’s case count, 61 infections were locally transmitted.The recent emergence of the Delta variant is also placing a huge challenge for the world’s second-largest economy. China’s stringent anti-Covid norms, which include mass testing as soon as a case emerges, aggressive contact tracing, widespread use of quarantines and targeted lockdowns, are also being put to test with the widespread increase of the variant.“The Delta variant is the biggest test of China’s zero-Covid strategy since the initial outbreak last year,” Julian Evans-Pritchard, a senior China economist at Capital Economics, told Reuters on Monday, adding he assumes that the country will quash the outbreak before it goes out of control.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-wuhan-to-test-all-residents-for-covid-19-as-virus-returns-101627963710089.html

NSO owns the Pegasus spyware.According to the Guardian report, the French agency for information systems security, called Anssi, detected digital traces of the spyware on the TV journalist’s phone. Anssi shared the findings with the Paris public prosecutor’s office, which is overseeing the probe into possible hacking.It also found the Pegasus spyware on phones belonging to Lénaïg Bredoux, a journalist at the French investigative website Mediapart, and the site’s director, Edwy Plenel.“We are stupefied and angry that journalists could be the object of spying. We will not be taking this lying down. There will be legal action,” a source at France 24 said.Paris-based Forbidden Stories says about 180 journalists across the world may have been selected as possible targets for surveillance by government clients of NSO Group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spyware-found-on-phones-of-journos-french-intelligence-101627952834969.html
03-08-2021||World||Lindsey Graham first vaccinated US senator to test positive for Covid-19||Sen. Lindsey Graham has become the first senator to disclose a breakthrough infection after being vaccinated against the coronavirus, saying Monday he is “very glad” he received the vaccine, without which his current symptoms would be “far worse.”The news prompted several other lawmakers to get quick Covid-19 tests and report their status. A handful of Senate colleagues spent part of the weekend working and socializing with the South Carolina Republican, who attended a gathering on Sen. Joe Manchin’s houseboat the evening that he first developed symptoms.In a statement issued Monday afternoon, Graham said he “started having flu-like symptoms Saturday night” and went to the doctor Monday morning.After being notified of his positive test, Graham said he would quarantine for 10 days.“I feel like I have a sinus infection, and at present time, I have mild symptoms,” the 66-year-old Graham said. “I am very glad I was vaccinated because without vaccination, I am certain I would not feel as well as I do now. My symptoms would be far worse.”According to spokesman Kevin Bishop, Graham was among senators who attended Manchin's event on Saturday. Sam Runyon, a spokeswoman for Manchin, said the West Virginia Democrat "is fully vaccinated and following the CDC guidelines for those exposed to a COVID positive individual.”In the Capitol Monday evening, senators who attended the gathering were present and voting. Manchin said he had since tested negative and said the outdoor event, which lasted several hours and featured hamburgers, was “just trying to get people together.”“We do everything in a bipartisan way, and that’s what we do,” Manchin said. “I talked to Lindsey today, he's fine.”Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., told reporters that he was also on the boat, named “Almost Heaven,” and was awaiting test results. Sens. John Thune, R-S.D., and Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., were also there and were getting tested.More senators have donned masks in recent weeks as coronavirus case counts have risen, but they aren’t required in the chamber, and some still choose not to wear them. The House has returned to a mask requirement.Senate Democrats will switch back to a virtual caucus lunch Tuesday at the Capitol amid the virus surge. Republicans had been quicker to resume in-person meetings last year, but there was no word if their lunch plans would now change.Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a Republican who is vaccinated, was not wearing a mask Monday and said he had not decided whether to put one back on. He said he’s concerned that reports of Graham’s illness will discourage some to get vaccinated.On wearing a mask, Blunt said, “I think it actually is one of the reasons that people are encouraged to get the vaccine is they don’t have to.”There’s no way to know just how risky it was for the people who were near Graham — vaccinated or not. Vaccinated people are at a much lower risk of being infected at all and for contracting a serious case. But the level of risk depends on whether Graham was masked, whether they were masked, how much virus his body was producing when they met, how close they were and for how long.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fully vaccinated people determined to have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 do not need to quarantine if they are asymptomatic but should be tested within five days and wear a mask indoors for 14 days or until testing negative.Graham, who was vaccinated in December, has long been a proponent of vaccination, saying during a visit this spring to the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston that “the sooner we get everybody vaccinated, the quicker we can get back to normal.”Graham's infection comes on the heels of updated CDC guidance urging even fully vaccinated people to return to wearing masks indoors in areas of high coronavirus transmission, citing the surge of the highly contagious delta variant. Recent analysis has shown that breakthrough cases of COVID-19, with mild or no symptoms, still remain rare.Both congressional chambers have been adopting stricter face covering regulations amid a resurgence in COVID-19 cases across the country.Graham, who was wearing a mask, did not answer questions from reporters on Capitol Hill earlier Monday, prior to the statement being issued. Because of Senate votes, Graham was not in attendance at Friday night’s Silver Elephant dinner, the South Carolina Republican Party’s signature annual fundraiser and an event attended by hundreds, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a headlining speaker.___Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP.___Mary Clare Jalonick and Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report from Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lindsey-graham-first-vaccinated-us-senator-to-test-positive-for-covid19-101627951534324.html

03-08-2021||World||Indian student allegedly murdered on Chinese varsity campus||A 20-year-old Indian student was allegedly murdered in his university room in the city of Tianjin, around 100km south of Beijing, last week, a family member said on Monday.The body of Aman Nagsen was found by the staff of Tianjin Foreign Studies University (TFSU) on Thursday in his room on the university campus. Nagsen was enrolled for the International Business Studies course and was from Gaya in Bihar. Details are sketchy about the case with neither the local police nor the Indian embassy in Beijing releasing particulars about it.The Chinese foreign ministry is yet to respond to a query from the Hindustan Times on the crime, which has many in the Indian diaspora in China abuzz.It could not be immediately confirmed if a foreign national was involved in the alleged murder.“We were informed about the death of my nephew by the university at 1am in the intervening night of July 29th and 30th,” the deceased’s uncle Pankaj Paswan said from Gaya.Late on Monday, Paswan, who has been in constant touch with officials at the Indian embassy in Beijing, told HT it was “murder” after being asked whether Nagsen’s family members suspected foul play behind the death of Nagsen.Family members had been informed about Tianjin police’s initial findings, HT learnt from official sources.Indian embassy officials here remained tight-lipped because of the “sensitivity” of the matter.Last week, worried family members got in touch with Nagsen’s local guardian in Beijing after being unable to contact him for several days.The local guardian in turn got in touch with TFSU authorities, persuading them to look him up.That was when Nagsen’s body was found in the room.Nagsen’s family last spoke to him on July 23 after which he did not respond to calls or messages and did not accept a money transfer via a mobile app.While the 20-year-old’s body was recovered in the intervening night of July 29 and 30, several questions remain unanswered including the exact time and date of the crime and, most importantly, motive.On July 30, Bihar’s BJP chief, Sanjay Jaiswal, tweeted about the death of the student and asked the embassy to intervene in bringing the youth’s body home.The Indian embassy responded in a tweet saying it was in communication with Chinese authorities and the deceased’s family and was “providing all possible assistance”.A distraught Paswan, the uncle quoted earlier, said the family has urgently requested the Indian government through the external affairs ministry to help in getting Nagsen’s body back in India. “We request both the Indian and Chinese governments to help in sending the body back to India,” he said.Paswan added that a demonstration was organised by a group of students in Gaya to demand the quick return of Nagsen’s remains.The news of Nagsen’s death was being shared among social media groups involving Indians with links to China and many requested the Indian embassy to urgently look into the matter as well.It was learnt that officials from the Indian embassy in Beijing are working on repatriating Nagsen’s remains to India and are in touch with authorities in Tianjin.As per Chinese protocol in such cases, autopsy is likely to be conducted before the body is released to be taken back to India.Nagsen was among the few Indian students to have remained in China following the Covid-19 outbreak here.The vast majority of around 23,000 Indian students studying here had returned to India by themselves or via evacuation flights in 2020.They have not been able to return to China because of the ban on the return of foreign students imposed by Beijing because of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-student-allegedly-murdered-on-chinese-varsity-campus-101627929987929.html

The ministers also agreed to make vaccination available for all children in the age group of 12 and 17.The citizens will be inoculated with mRNA-vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna irrespective of the jabs they had originally been administered; the ministers confirmed following discourse with the federal health minister Jens Spahn.This development comes amid speculations of the country imposing curbs and lockdowns owing to the rise of cases from the Delta variant of Covid-19, even as Europe’s largest economy sees an approaching general election next month, the Reuters report added.The 16 states manage their own health affairs, and are keen on administering coronavirus vaccines to more people in order to keep the fourth wave of the virus outbreak at bay. A little over 52% of the population has been fully vaccinated and nearly 62% have received at least one jab.The ministers pointed out that vaccinated children between 12 and 17 is voluntary, and will only be proceeded with after parental consent and a medical check-up that negates any serious health risk, is provided.Notably, German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced in May that the country will begin offering coronavirus vaccine jabs to children aged over 12 from June 12 onwards. “The main message to parents is: there will be no compulsory vaccinations,” she told reporters at the time.Merkel had, however, urged parents to be patient saying that not every parent would get an appointment to get their child vaccinated against coronavirus.Also Read | 'Covid-19 not over yet': Germany to vaccinate children over 12 from June 7Canada and the US have already started administering vaccine doses to children over 12.Nearly 10% of the 4.5 million children in Germany in the said age group have already been fully vaccinated. Meanwhile, the country has been witnessing over 2,000 new cases every day since Wednesday. The seven-day average incidence stood at barely under 18 per 100,000 on Monday, according to Reuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/16-german-states-to-offer-booster-dose-against-covid-19-to-vulnerable-citizens-101627928418297.html
