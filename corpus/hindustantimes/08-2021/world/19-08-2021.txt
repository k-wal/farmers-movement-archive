External affairs minister S Jaishankar, who chaired the meeting, did not name any country but targeted those that provided sanctuaries and extended hospitality to such groups.“It is, therefore, vital that this Council does not take a selective, tactical or complacent view of the problems we face. We must never countenance sanctuaries for terrorists or overlook their raising of resources. And when we see state hospitality being extended to those with innocents blood on their hands, we should never lack the courage to call out their double-speak,” he said.“Let us always remember that what is true of Covid is even more true of terrorism: none of us are safe until all of us are safe,” he added.This was the third signature event organised by India while holding the rotating presidency of the UN’s top body for August.Other Security Council members joined India’s call for a zero tolerance approach towards all forms of terrorism, and most of the countries, including the US, the UK and China, called for holding the Taliban accountable to its commitment to not allow Afghan soil to be used any terrorist groups.At a media stakeout following the briefing, Jaishankar said both India and Afghanistan have been affected by cross-border terrorism. “I specifically mentioned some of the groups...Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba. And I think this is a continuing issue, and we made the point very strongly that it’s important therefore that there are no double standards, there are no distinctions. Terrorism is terrorism,” he said.On Afghanistan, the minister reiterated what he said on Wednesday that India, like other countries, was focused on getting back its citizens safely and that the country’s ties with the future dispensation in Kabul will be guided by its historic ties with the people. “We are working with international partners in this regard, principally the US because they control the airport,” he said.After the briefing, the UNSC issued a statement specifically condemning specific terrorist incidents around the world and the spread of the Islamic State group. It urged member countries “to ensure that all measures undertaken to counter the financing of terrorism comply with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law, international human rights law and international refugee law”.At the briefing, Jaishankar reiterated an eight-point plan that he had first laid out for the Security Council in January, which opposed justifying or glorifying terrorism -- as has been done by Pakistan – and distinguishing between “good” or “bad” terrorists -- which too has also been done by Islamabad. In a thinly veiled reference to China, the action plan also opposed attempts to block and hold up designation of terrorists and entities without any reason.The minister recalled India’s long involvement in countering terrorism as a country that has suffered deeply to express “solidarity with victims and their families all over the world who have suffered, and continue to suffer, from the scourge of terrorism”.He added: “We must never compromise with this evil.”In spite of the progress made to tighten the legal, security, financing and other frameworks to combat terrorism, terrorists are constantly finding newer ways of motivating, resourcing and executing acts of terror, the minister said, citing even the use of Bitcoin in some instances.“Unfortunately, there are also some countries who seek to undermine or subvert our collective resolve to fight terrorism. This cannot be allowed to pass,” he said.Jaishankar was pointing to Pakistan’s continued support for terrorism, which came under fresh scrutiny as the Taliban recaptured Afghanistan after operating from sanctuaries across the border.The situation in Afghanistan, the minister said, has “naturally enhanced global concerns about their implications for both regional and international security”, especially with heightened activities of the Haqqani Network, the armed wing of the Taliban, which has operated from safe havens in Pakistan.In conclusion, the minister called for adopting the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism that India has championed for so long.The UNSC briefing considered the 13th report of the Secretary General on the threat posed by ISIL (Daesh) to international peace and security. The August 3 report states that Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan has expanded its presence in several provinces of Afghanistan and strengthened positions in and around Kabul.The report said that one of the main risks identified by member states is that “militants in Afghanistan, from the Taliban or other groups, may join the Daesh affiliate if they feel alienated or threatened by developments in the Afghan peace process”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-highlights-role-of-pak-terror-groups-in-afghanistan-at-unsc-101629396453386.html

It said some countries continue to “undermine or subvert our collective resolve”, and the unfolding events in Afghanistan remain a cause of global concern.“Let us always remember that what is true of Covid is even more true of terrorism: none of us are safe until all of us are safe,” Indian external affairs minister S Jaishankar said in an impassioned plea comparing the scourge of terrorism to Covid-19, the pandemic that has killed millions around the world. The minister was participating in a UNSC briefing on threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts, specially the Islamic State. This was the second UNSC meeting he chaired since Wednesday, when he had presided over an open debate of the council on peacekeeping. “We are happy to note that a very strong substantive, clear press statement has been adopted by the council today that outlines, many of the key concerns, especially the need to ensure a strict check on terror financing and bringing the perpetrators of terror attacks to justice,” the minister said to reporters after the UNSC meeting, adding, “During our deliberations today all Security Council members with one voice, endorsed a zero tolerance approach to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We are clear that there cannot be double standards and distinctions are really made at our collective peril.”On Afghanistan, the minister reiterated what he said on Wednesday that India, like other countries, was focused on getting back its citizens safely and that India’s ties with the future dispensation in Kabul will be guided by its historic ties with the people.The press statement specifically condemning specific terrorist incidents around the world and the spread of IS.

He added: “We must never compromise with this evil.”In spite of the progress made to tighten the legal, security, financing and other frameworks to combat terrorism, terrorists are constantly finding newer ways of motivating, resourcing and executing acts of terror, the minister said, adding, “Unfortunately, there are also some countries who seek to undermine or subvert our collective resolve to fight terrorism.

When we see state hospitality being extended to those with innocents’ blood on their hands, we should never lack the courage to call out their double-speak,” the minister said further.He went on to reiterate an eight-point plan he had unveiled in January before the council: don’t justify terrorism, don’t glorify terrorists; display no double standards, terrorists are terrorists, distinctions are made only at our own peril; don’t place blocks and holds on listing requests without any reason; discourage exclusivist thinking and be on guard against new terminologies and false priorities; list and delist objectively, not on political or religious considerations; recognise the linkage to organised crime; support and strengthen the FATF (Financial Action Task Force) ; and provide greater funding to UN Office of Counter Terrorism.The minister had clearly pointed to China when he urged countries against placing blocks and holds on designation of terrorists. Citing frivolous reasons, Beijing held up the designation of Masood Azhar of the Jaish-e-Mohammad for years by the UN Security Council before being forced to relent by the US, France and United Kingdom.And he was pointing to Pakistan when he asked countries not to seek the enlisting or delisting of terrorist and entities for political and religious reasons.In conclusion, the minister called for adopting the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism that India has championed for so long.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unsc-shouldn-t-have-selective-approach-to-tackle-terrorism-india-101629390594462.html

The President said that he would receive the booster shot even as the World Health Organization (WHO) experts expressed concerns over equitable vaccine distribution after the US said that it would provide boosters to all its citizens.“We are going to get the booster shots. We got our shots all the way back in, I think, December. So, it's past time,” Biden replied when asked if he and the First Lady had got their booster shots.The US health officials had said that the effectiveness of the vaccines against the disease diminished over time, based on findings from recent studies.

The UN health agency said that the data “clearly” showed that top-up for vaccines were not needed. Further, the WHO also cautioned the possibilities of new variants of the disease emerging from the unvaccinated regions. In reply, White House press secretary Jen Psaki and US surgeon general Vivek Murthy said that the US is also contributing globally in the fight against the pandemic.During the interview, Biden, too, made a similar case supporting the US decision to provide boosters. When asked if he was comfortable with US citizens getting a third shot when millions around the world are yet to receive their first, Biden replied, “Absolutely because we're providing more to the rest of the world than all the rest of the world combined. We got enough for everybody (and) Americans, plus before we get to the middle of next year, we are going to provide a half a billion shots to the rest of the world. We are keeping our part of the bargain. We are doing more than anybody.”The US authorities said that people who had received the Pfizer and the Moderna shots would need a booster after eight months of the second dose. Biden was inoculated with the Pfizer vaccine, with a first dose in December 2020 and a second dose in January this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-defends-covid-19-booster-vaccines-in-us-would-get-the-shots-along-with-first-lady-101629390159460.html

In an interview with ABC aired on Thursday, Biden raised apprehensions about the Taliban wanting to be recognised as a legitimate government by the international community."I think they're going through a sort of existential crisis about: Do they want to be recognized by the international community as being a legitimate government? I'm not sure they do," said Biden, who has been facing flak for rushing the troops out of Afghanistan.The US president was asked whether he thought the Taliban had changed since his administration followed through the withdrawal process.

"I'm not counting on any of that."Meanwhile, analysts fear that the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan risks emboldening jihadists worldwide. They argue that the ouster of Ashraf Ghani’s government in a lightning push despite years of war involving US-led foreign troops could serve as an example to jihadists on how “patience and careful strategy can pay off even after the defeat of IS in Syria and Iraq,” reported news agency AFP."The Taliban's victory will give jihadist groups worldwide a major boost.

19-08-2021||World||Can Taliban survive without Heroin as they vow to ban drug trade, smuggling?||Heroin production has boomed in Afghanistan in recent years, helping fund the Taliban, and experts say they will struggle to wean themselves off the profitable trade despite their promise to do so.Speaking Tuesday at a first press conference since taking power, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid promised that the new government would not turn the world's leading producer of opium into a fully-fledged narco-state."We are assuring our countrymen and women and the international community, we will not have any narcotics produced," Mujahid told reporters in Kabul."From now on, nobody's going to get involved (in the heroin trade), nobody can be involved in drug smuggling."But the anti-heroin rhetoric -- like similar pledges to respect human rights and media freedom -- are seen by analysts as part of efforts by the new Taliban leaders to show a more moderate face in order to secure international backing.The vast majority of the world's opium and heroin comes from Afghanistan, with production and exports centred in areas controlled by the Taliban, which has taxed the drugs heavily during their 20-year insurgency.It has become a key resource for the group and they could struggle to ban it, said Jonathan Goodhand, an expert in the international drugs trade at SOAS University of London."Drugs will bring out a set of tensions in the movement," he predicted.On one hand, "they want to create this image of themselves as more moderate and more open to engagement with the West and they realise drugs is one of way of doing this," he said.But on the other, any repression would hit farmers in the Taliban political heartlands of Helmand and Kandahar provinces in particular."It's going to struggle to take a very aggressive approach to drugs," he added.- Near-monopoly -In his premier press conference, Mujahid pleaded for "international assistance" to provide farmers with alternative crops to poppies, the source of sap that is refined into morphine and heroin.The appeal for international aid might prompt hollow laughs from people who worked in the coalition of NATO forces, NGOs and UN workers over the last 10 years that tried in vain to break Afghanistan's reliance on poppy farming.The United States spent around $8.6 billion (7.4 billion euros) from 2002 to 2017 in its doomed effort to combat the drugs trade, according to a 2018 report from the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan (SIGAR).Those efforts included paying farmers to grow wheat or saffron, investing in transport links, as well as spraying defoliants on crops and bombing refining facilities.At each step, they found themselves thwarted by Taliban fighters who controlled the main poppy-growing regions and derived hundreds of millions of dollars from the industry, according to US and Afghan government estimates.Farmers in Taliban-controlled areas would often come under pressure to plant poppies from local warlords and fighters, investigations have found.As a result, the country has a near-monopoly on opium and heroin, accounting for 80 to 90 percent of global output, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).The amount of land planted with poppies hit a record high in 2017 and has averaged around 250,000 hectares in the last four years, roughly four times the level of the mid-1990s, UN figures show.- 'Too tied up' -The narcotics policy of the new government will affect global heroin prices, with repercussions for Western countries and their addicts, as well as Russia, Iran, Pakistan and China -- all major smuggling routes but also huge markets for Afghan drugs.In recent years, traffickers have also discovered that a plant commonly found in Afghanistan called ephedra can be used to create a key component of methamphetamine, better known as "crystal meth".Still, spokesman Mujahid vowed Afghanistan would be a "narcotics-free country" moving forward.It's not the first time the fundamentalist group has vowed to outlaw the trade. Production was banned in 2000, just before the group was overthrown by US-led forces.Gretchen Peters, the American author of the book "Seeds of Terror: How Heroin Is Bankrolling the Taliban and Al-Qaeda", said the Taliban's previous ban on poppy cultivation was tactical."They were under immense international pressure," she said. "It was a ploy because they had so much stored up. They made a huge amount of money once the price shot up by 10 times.""They are not going to get rid of the drug trade because they are too tied up with it.""Afghanistan cannot survive without opium. It is simultaneously killing Afghanistan while also keeping a huge number of people alive," she said, referring to the income the industry provides to poor farmers.Being in control of the country will offer the Taliban access to airlines, the state bureaucracy and banks which could be used to facilitate drug smuggling and money laundering, she explained."I have no doubt they will exploit it."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-taliban-survive-without-heroin-as-they-vow-to-ban-drug-trade-smuggling-101629370764396.html

The US Capitol Police issued an alert on social media platforms, saying it is “an active bomb threat investigation”. The police said they were “responding to a suspicious vehicle near the Library of Congress.”“The staging area for journalists covering this situation is at Constitution and First Street, NW for your safety. Please continue to avoid the area around the Library of Congress,” the law enforcement agency added.The threat has been reported days after the US department of homeland security issued a new terrorism threat advisory due to the “heightened threat environment” ahead of the 20th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks. The National Terrorism Advisory System (NTAS) said last Friday in its bulletin that the US continues to face a “diverse and challenging” threat environment.“Today’s NTAS Bulletin advises the public about the heightened threat landscape we face and how DHS is working with our partners, at every level of government and in the community, to combat domestic terrorism and targeted violence in all its forms," secretary of homeland security Alejandro N. Mayorkas said in a statement.The homeland security department warned that the extremists and terror groups are increasingly exploiting online forums to spread violent extremist narratives and promote violent activity.“Such threats are also exacerbated by impacts of the ongoing global pandemic, including grievances over public health safety measures and perceived government restrictions,” the advisory added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-capitol-police-probing-bomb-threat-near-congress-library-101629383858966.html

This is done not only by listening to what is said, but also by watching what is done,” foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said.She added that the rapidly changing situation in Afghanistan shows that the past judgement on the nation by the outside world lacked objectiveness and an accurate grasp of public opinion in Afghanistan.Quoting what the Taliban leadership has so far said, Hua said, they have given the assurance that the militant group will work to resolve the problems faced by the people, meet their aspirations, and strive to build an open, inclusive Islamic government. “We have also noticed that some political figures of Russia and other countries and many international media have recognised Afghan Taliban’s behaviour after it entered Kabul, believing their good, positive and pragmatic actions.”“Although the Afghan situation is not fully clear yet, they believe the Afghan Taliban will not repeat history, and the Afghan Taliban today is more clear-headed and rational than it was in power last time,” Hua added.The Taliban have also stated that it is committed to equality for all and will protect women’s freedom of speech, employment and educational rights, Hua said, responding to a question whether Beijing will demand the protection of rights of women unlike when the group was in power 20 years ago.On Wednesday, China said it will decide on extending diplomatic recognition to the Taliban in Afghanistan only after the formation of the government, which it hoped would be “open, inclusive and broadly representative”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-clear-headed-rational-than-two-decades-ago-china-101629380267330.html

Paul ‘Pen’ Farthing, a former Marine who currently lives in Kabul with his wife, told the Daily Mail that two expats were forced to return as they could not get through the crowds.“Two expats - one British and one Norwegian - have already been forced to turn back this morning because they can't get through,” the Daily Mail quoted Farthing as saying on Thursday.He also said that on Wednesday, a UN convoy was also forced to return due to the number of people on the streets. “And last night a UN convoy carrying various foreign nationals, who had been working in Afghanistan for NGOs, had to turn around because of the sheer volume of people on the street,” he further said.The report also noted that earlier in the day, UK defence secretary Ben Wallace had said that the Taliban militants were allowing people with travel documents through checkpoints and no British flights were flying empty, saying that “not a single seat is wasted.” Wallace also said that as many as 120 people were evacuated from Afghanistan on Thursday morning with another 138 people scheduled to be evacuated later in the day, the Daily Mail also reported.Meanwhile, the US has demanded safe passage for the tens of thousands of people trying to flee the hardline regime in the country. Earlier, several news reports said that the Taliban militants have manned checkpoints around the Kabul airport, which raised concerns about the safety of the people trying to reach the airport. “We have seen reports that the Taliban, contrary to their public statements and their commitments to our government, are blocking Afghans who wish to leave the country from reaching the airport,” news agency AFP quoted deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman as saying.The official further said that the US expects the militants to allow “all American citizens, all third-country nationals and all Afghans” who wanted to leave the country to do so without any harassment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/foreign-expats-say-crowds-of-terrified-locals-hindering-access-to-kabul-airport-in-afghanistan-report-101629379423432.html

The AP-NORC poll commenced on August 12, three days before the Taliban captured Kabul, and concluded on August 16, a day after Afghanistan's capital city was conquered.Also Read | Family of Afghan boy who fell off US plane speaks out, says searching for younger sonThough the survey does not specify its sample size, it claims that roughly two-thirds or around 66 per cent respondents think that the war, which, at nearly 20 years, is America's longest, was "worth fighting." On president Joe Biden, who, in April, issued directions to withdraw the US troops, 47 per cent respondents voiced approval for his management of international affairs, while 52 per cent expressed satisfaction with his national security policies.Also Read | Taliban's Afghanistan takeover biggest event since Crimea: EU's Josep BorrellBiden, who has come under severe criticism both at home and abroad for the chaos in Afghanistan, has twice defended his decision to recall US troops.

"I don't believe we should have there in the first place. But now, I do feel we probably should stay, after seeing the trouble we've caused," a 23-year-old respondent, who voted for Biden last year, was quoted as saying.Also Read | 'Haven't said no': Taliban dismiss reports of not wanting trade relations with certain countriesAdditionally, about half of the respondents said they are "extremely or very concerned" about threats to the US posed by extremist groups based away from the country.

The group's recent advance towards Kabul, and its subsequent victory, came amid American troops withdrawing from Afghanistan.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/significant-majority-of-americans-doubt-afghan-war-was-worthwhile-survey-finds-101629375239961.html

19-08-2021||World||'Haven't said no': Taliban dismiss reports of not wanting trade relations with certain countries||The Taliban on Thursday rejected the reports of them not wanting trade relations with any nation, claiming the “rumours” about their trade preferences are not true. Taking to Twitter, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said that the group wants “better diplomatic and trade relations” with all countries.“The Islamic Emirate wants better diplomatic and trade relations with all countries. We have not said no about not trading with any country. The rumours that have been spread about this are not true and we reject it,” tweeted Mujahid, who made his first public appearance this week after Kabul fell to the Ismalist fundamentalists.The Taliban’s statement comes a day after news agency ANI reported the rebels have stopped all imports and exports from India through transit routes of Pakistan. The director-general of the Federation of Indian Export Organisation (FIEO), Ajay Sahai, told ANI that the Taliban has stopped the movement of cargo to Pakistan, which has virtually halted the imports to India."We keep a close watch on developments in Afghanistan. Imports from there come through transit route of Pakistan. As of now, Taliban has stopped movement of cargo to Pakistan, so virtually imports have been stopped," ANI quoted Sahai as saying.India has been one of the largest trade partners of Afghanistan in recent times and has invested heavily in infrastructure and reconstruction projects in the war-torn country. But the Taliban takeover has raised apprehensions about the future of trade relations and infrastructure projects in Afghanistan.“We imported goods worth around $510 million. But besides the trade, we have a sizeable investment in Afghanistan. We have invested around $3 billion in Afghanistan and there are 400-odd projects in Afghanistan some of which are currently going on," said Sahai.While exports range from sugar, pharmaceuticals, apparel, tea, coffee, spices and transmission towers, imports are largely limited to dry fruits. Sahai expressed concern that prices of dry fruits may go up in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/havent-said-no-taliban-dismiss-reports-of-not-wanting-trade-relations-with-certain-countries-101629369409014.html

Britain expressed concerns the Taliban's return to power creates a haven for terrorist groups including Al-Qaeda."Around the world, Islamists will see what they will view as a victory and that will inspire other terrorists," Wallace said in the interview.Earlier in the day, the Taliban celebrated Afghanistan's Independence Day by declaring they beat the United States. It is not clear how the group will rule the south Asian country this time as challenges to their rule, ranging from running a country severely short on cash and bureaucrats to potentially facing armed opposition, are starting to emerge.A humanitarian crisis is also starting to unfold in Afghanistan due to the mass exodus of people fearing the radical policies of the Taliban.On Wednesday, the head of the UN food agency in Afghanistan said that a humanitarian crisis is unfolding with 14 million people facing severe hunger following the Taliban takeover of the country.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fallout-in-afghanistan-means-west-is-now-perceived-as-weak-uk-minister-101629366704315.html

The trial was funded by National Institutes of Health (NIH), US Department of Health and Human Services.The trial was stopped in February as it did not prevent the progression of the infection as expected, a statement from NIH said. Principal investigator Clifton Callaway said that the reduction they observed was less than two per cent.“That was surprising to us. As physicians, we wanted this to make a big difference in reducing severe illness and it did not,” he was quoted as saying in the trial paper published in The New England Journal of Medicine.The NIH is funding more such studies to get conclusigve evidence to see if the treatment can help Covid-19 partients recover faster. The patients include those in hospitals as well as recovering at home.India had dropped the plasma therapy from the list of treatment for Covid-19 patients in May this year after evidence showed it wasn't benefiting the patients in any way.Convalescent plasma therapy uses a blood component called plasma rich in virus-fighting antibodies from recovered Covid-19 patients to aid the immune system in fighting off the infection.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) conducted a similar trial in September last year and the data showed that the therapy did not prevent progression to severe disease or reduce the number of deaths at 28-days of enrolment of the patient.Many health experts across India had urged the central government to exercise caution against the "irrational and non-scientific use" of convalescent plasma in treating Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/convalescent-plasma-did-not-stop-covid-19-progression-show-nih-trial-results-101629365727630.html

19-08-2021||World||Taliban urge Afghans to leave Kabul airport after days of deadly chaos||The Taliban on Thursday urged crowds of Afghans waiting outside Kabul airport in the hope of fleeing the country to go home, saying they did not want to hurt anyone, a day after Taliban fighters fired at protesters, killing three, witnesses said.The United States and other Western powers pressed on with the evacuation of their nationals and some of their Afghan staff from the airport on Afghanistan's Independence Day, which could trigger more protests against the Islamists.While Kabul has been generally calm since Taliban forces entered on Sunday after a week of stunning advances across the country, the airport has been in chaos as people rushed for a way out of Afghan capital.Twelve people have been killed in and around the airport since Sunday, a NATO and a Taliban official said. The deaths were caused either by gun shots or by stampedes, the Taliban official said.He urged people who do not have the legal right to travel to go home. "We don't want to hurt anyone at the airport," said the Taliban official, who declined to be identified.About 8,000 people have been flown out since Sunday, a Western security official said. The U.S. military is in charge of the airport while Taliban fighters patrol outside its walled and fenced perimeter.On Wednesday, witnesses said Taliban gunmen prevented people from getting into the airport compound."It's a complete disaster. The Taliban were firing into the air, pushing people, beating them with AK-47s," said one person trying to get out on Wednesday.A Taliban official said commanders and soldiers had fired into the air to disperse the crowd. The situation was more calm on Thursday, witnesses said.Under a pact negotiated last year by former President Donald Trump's administration, the United States agreed to withdraw its forces in exchange for a Taliban guarantee they would not let Afghanistan be used to launch terrorist attacks.The Taliban also agreed not to attack foreign forces as they left.President Joe Biden said U.S. forces would remain until the evacuation of Americans was finished, even if that meant staying past a Aug. 31 U.S. deadline for withdrawal.The Taliban have been putting on a moderate face, saying they have changed since their 1996-2001 rule when they severely restricted women, staged public executions and blew up ancient Buddhist statues.They now say they want peace within the framework of Islamic law.But there are serious doubts about their assurances.'My flag'Demonstrations in the eastern city of Jalalabad on Wednesday marked the first major display of collective defiance of the Taliban takeover.In normal times, the country would celebrate Afghanistan's 1919 independence from British control on Aug. 19, but scenes in Jalalabad raised the prospect that people could use the patriotic occasion to protest.Two witnesses and a former police official told Reuters Taliban fighters opened fire when protesters in Jalalabad tried to raise the national flag, killing three and wounding more than a dozen.Video footage posted online and aired by media showed hundreds of people in Jalalabad with the black, red and green tricolour flying from rooftops and carried by some protesters. Media reported they had torn down the white Taliban flag."I will sacrifice my life for this flag. This is my flag. My government will soon be back, God willing," said one protester wrapped in the tricolour in a report from Sky News.The centre of opposition to the Taliban is the Panjshir Valley, an ethnic-Tajik stronghold to the northeast of Kabul.In an op-ed for the Washington Post, Amad Massoud, the Panjshiri leader of the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan called for Western support to fight the Taliban."I write from the Panjshir Valley today, ready to follow in my father’s footsteps, with mujahideen fighters who are prepared to once again take on the Taliban," wrote Massoud, the son of Amhad Shah Massoud, a veteran guerrilla leader assassinated by suspected al Qaeda terrorist on behalf of the Taliban in 2001.Other former Afghan leaders including ex-president Hamid Karzai, have been holding talks with the Taliban as they put together a new government.The Taliban government may take the form of a ruling council with supreme leader Haibatullah Akhundzada in overall charge, said Waheedullah Hashimi, a senior member of the group.Afghanistan would not be a democracy.

"Don't let your histories have a chapter on humiliation and bowing to terror groups," he wrote as he was reacting to the tweet of a former White House official.As the Taliban took control over Afghanistan on August 15 and Ashraf Ghani left the country, Amrullah Saleh announced that under no circumstances, he will bow to the Taliban. On August 17, he declared himself as the caretaker President and said that as per the constitution of Afghanistan, in absence, escape, resignation or death of the President, the first vice president becomes the caretaker President. "I am currently inside my country & am the legitimate caretaker President. Am reaching out to all leaders to secure their support and consensus," he said.What is Panjshir Resistance? 10 things to know about alliance against TalibanThough Saleh's whereabouts are unknown, he is believed to be in the Panjshir Valley of the Panjshir province of Afghanistan, firming up the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan."It is futile to argue with POTUS on Afghanistan now. Let him digest it. We the Afghans must prove that "Afghanistan is not Vietnam and the Talibs are not even remotely like Vietcong. Unlike US/NATO, we have not lost spirit and see enormous opportunities ahead. Unless caveats are finished. Join the resistance," Amrullah recently tweeted.A follower of Ahmad Shah Massoud, Amrullah Saleh, a native of Panjshir Valley, was a member of the Northern Alliance, which was formed when the Taliban came to power in 1996. He received his military training in Pakistan and in 1997 was appointed by Massoud as the liaison officer of the Northern Alliance in the Afghan Embassy in Tajikistan.As part of the Nothern Alliance, Amrullah Saleh became a point-person of the CIA in Afghanistan.After the Taliban regime was toppled, Amrullah Saleh became the head of the National Directorate of Security in 2004, when Hamid Karzai was the president.

Biden has acknowledged that the Taliban takeover happened "much sooner than expected", but a damning account by a former US intelligence official of how warnings were ignored can spell further trouble for the Biden administration.Douglas London, who worked as Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) counterterrorism chief for South and Southwest Asia before retiring in 2019, has said that the agency warned about the outcome of early withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan to former president Donald Trump years ago. Despite the warnings, Trump made the decision, which was ratified by his successor Joe Biden, London said in an article published in Just Security, a website on law, rights, and US national security.London rubbished the narrative that it was an intelligence failure, and said that the Afghanistan decision was taken due to "political and ideological considerations"."It was a path to which Trump and Biden allowed themselves to be held captive owing to the “ending Forever Wars” slogan they both embraced," he said in the article.Also Read: Haqqani network cadres control Kabul, Mullah Yaqoob in KandaharThe ex-CIA official said that the US intelligence agencies had assesses the situation in Afghanistan according to various scenarios and conditions depending on multiple policy alternatives.He further said that the federal government was warned by the intelligence community that Afghan politicians, warlords and miltary leaders who benefitted from America's sustained presence and money may lose confidence if US forces withdraw. "Switching sides for a better deal or to fight another day is a hallmark of Afghan history," London added.Among the different scenarios presented to the US federal government were retaining 5,000 troops and most of the existing forward military and intelligence operating bases, to at least maintaining a number 2,500 troops and larger bases in greater Kabul, Bagram, Jalalabad and Khost, he said. That would have prevented Afghanistan's collapse for 1-2 years and still provide for a degree of continued US counterterrorism pressure, London added.A "Kabul only" option was also presented with the retention of the sprawling US Bagram air base and other intelligence facilities, said London, adding that none of these scenarios were adopted which led to dissolution of government within days.Afghanistan fell into turmoil after the Taliban seized power in the country by capturing province after province since launching their offensive in May. It ended with the fall of Kabul on Sunday.The Taliban celebrated Afghanistan's Independence Day on Thursday by declaring it had beaten the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/warnings-ignored-ex-cia-official-says-afghan-decision-a-policy-failure-101629358994703.html
19-08-2021||World||What is Panjshir Resistance? 10 things to know about alliance against Taliban||The Panjshir Valley remains the last area of Afghanistan standing strong against the Taliban. Afghan ambassador to Tajikistan Zahir Aghbar has said that this province will serve as a stronghold for resistance against the Taliban by Amrullah Saleh, the first vice president of the erstwhile Afghan government who has claimed himself as the acting president of Afghanistan. The Afghan embassy in Dushanbe in Tajikistan put up the portrait of Amrullah Saleh as the caretaker head of state.While resistance is being fomented from the valley, here are 10 things you must know about the Panjshir valley.1. The valley is located north of Kabul in the Hindu Kush. This was a resistance stronghold against the Soviets in the 1980s and then against the Taliban in the 1990s.2. Amrullah Saleh was born in Panjshir province and was trained there.3. Since it always remained the resistance zone, it was never conquered by any forces -- neither by foreign forces nor by the Taliban.4. Panjshir valley means the valley of the five lions. The name acknowledges a legend that says back in the 10th century, five brothers managed to contain the floodwaters. They built a dam for Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, it is said.5. The valley is home to over one lakh people and many of them are Tajiks. The valley has the country's largest concentration of ethnic Tajiks.6. The valley is the epicentre of what is being called the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan or the Second Resistance. Ahmad Massoud, Amrullah Saleh, Bismillah Khan Mohammadi are the leaders of the Panjshir Resistance.7. This is also being called a renewed Northern Alliance. Northern Alliance was the coalition of rebel groups that opposed the Taliban rule between 1996 and 2001. Apart from Ahmad Shah Massoud, Amrullah Saleh, the alliance included Karim Khalili, Abdul Rashid Dostum, Abdullah Abdullah, Mohammad Mohaqiq, Abdul Qadir, Asif Mohseni etc.8. The Taliban have not attacked Panjshir and many believe that it is because of the location of the valley, which makes it a natural fortress.9. The whereabouts of Amrullah Saleh is not known but he is believed to be in Panjshir. On Thursday, he took to Twitter and wrote, "Nations must respect the rule of law, not violence. Afghanistan is too big for Pakistan to swallow and too big for Talibs to govern. Don't let your histories have a chapter on humiliation and bowing to terror groups."10. Ahmad Massoud, son of Ahmad Shah Massaoud, has sought help from the West. In an opinion piece published in the Washington Post, he wrote, "I write from the Panjshir Valley today, ready to follow in my father’s footsteps, with mujahideen fighters who are prepared to once again take on the Taliban. We have stores of ammunition and arms that we have patiently collected since my father’s time, because we knew this day might come...The Taliban is not a problem for the Afghan people alone. Under Taliban control, Afghanistan will without doubt become ground zero of radical Islamist terrorism; plots against democracies will be hatched here once again."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-panjshir-resistance-10-things-to-know-about-alliance-against-taliban-101629356324482.html
19-08-2021||World||New Zealand says it solved Covid-19 'puzzle' that forced nation into lockdown||New Zealand reported a breakthrough Thursday in tracing the source of a Covid-19 outbreak that plunged the nation into lockdown, with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern saying it should help "stamp out" the virus.Health officials have been trying to determine how an Auckland man contracted the coronavirus this week, ending a six-month run of no community cases in New Zealand.Tests showed the man had a version of the Delta strain found in Australia, and Ardern said investigations narrowed down the origin to a person who arrived from Sydney on August 7.She said the traveller had been in quarantine and hospital since touching down, indicating the virus had not been in the community as long as initially feared."We believe we have uncovered the piece of the puzzle we were looking for," Ardern told reporters.She said finding the outbreak's source also increased the "ability to circle the virus, lock it down and stamp it out".Case numbers grew by 11 overnight to a total of 21, she said.Ardern ordered a three-day national lockdown -- New Zealand's first in 15 months -- when the first case emerged on Tuesday, with Auckland and nearby Coromandel facing restrictions for a week."We're all prepared for cases to get worse before they get better, that's always the pattern in these outbreaks," she said.But she said there were grounds for cautious optimism "because we believe it wasn't here for long before it was found".The infected traveller arrived from Sydney on a so-called "red zone" flight, arranged to bring back New Zealanders stranded when Wellington suspended a trans-Tasman travel bubble due to multiple outbreaks in Australia.The person tested positive two days later and was hospitalised a week after that.Officials said it was still unclear how the virus spread into the community and 1,000 close contacts of positive cases were being assessed.A decision is due Friday on whether the three-day lockdown will be extended or end by Saturday.'Covid zero' strategyNew Zealand has adopted a policy of eliminating the virus in the community, rather than containing it, which has resulted in only 26 deaths in a population of five million.Neighbouring Australia has been pursuing a similar "Covid zero" strategy but is struggling to contain outbreaks of the Delta variant.Health authorities on Thursday urged mass Covid testing for an entire Outback town in far western New South Wales, where an outbreak that began in Sydney two months ago is spreading.The area is grappling with Australia's first significant outbreak in Aboriginal communities, with specialist military health teams deployed this week to boost sluggish vaccination efforts.Early in the pandemic, Wilcannia's roughly 750 residents put up signs on the town's limits asking travellers not to stop -- fearing the virus could obliterate an already vulnerable community, where more than 60 per cent identify as Indigenous.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-says-it-solved-covid-19-puzzle-that-forced-nation-into-lockdown-101629356259835.html
19-08-2021||World||'Wasn't aware how important US President's role is': Donald Trump||Former president of the United States Donald Trump this week gave a rare interview since leaving the office earlier in January, in which he admitted that he wasn't aware of the President's power and how important the role is in the country. The interview was broadcast on Fox News on Tuesday night which gave a glimpse of Trump's understanding of the presidential powers."I have never realised how important, frankly - and it is a horrible thing to say - how important a president, the head of this country is,” the Republican leader said in the interview. Trump also said that he had thought that the office would "maybe run through the bureaucracy.""It doesn't. You need somebody up there that they are going to respect," he added.During the conversation, Trump also spoke about the US forces pullout from Afghanistan and slammed President Joe Biden for the mismanagement in the process. He called his handling of the issue "the greatest embarrassment in the history of our country"."I don't think in all of the years, our country has ever been so humiliated," Trump said, adding, "there has never been anything like what's happened here."Afghanistan is facing one of the worst humanitarian crises in the history of the country as US forces began pulling out of the country after striking a deal with the Taliban insurgents. With most of the troops already withdrawn, the Taliban took over the capital city of Kabul over the weekend after the collapse of the Afghan government.The issue created massive turmoil in the country as mass exodus was triggered by people fearing the return of the brutal regime of the Taliban which had ended in 2001 with the US' entry.This has led to massive backlash for Biden as critics say that the evolvi crisis could have been prevented if Washington had strategised it better.The peace deal between the US and the Taliban was cracked during Trump's presidency in which Washington promised to leave Afghanistan in exchange for a promise by the Taliban to not attack their country.However, during Tuesday's interview, Trump refused to share the blame for the Afghanistan crisis.Meanwhile, the head of the UN food agency in Afghanistan on Wednesday said that a humanitarian crisis is unfolding with 14 million people facing severe hunger following the Taliban takeover of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wasnt-aware-how-important-us-president-s-role-is-donald-trump-101629354876417.html

This comes a few days after a devastating earthquake killed almost 2,189 people across the Caribbean nation, according to its civil protection agency.There were no immediate reports of deaths or damage in the region by Wednesday's quake.More than 12,000 people were injured when an earthquake jolted the south-western region of the country on Saturday (August 14), about 160 kilometres to the west of the capital city Port-au-Prince.Also Read| Explained: What makes Haiti prone to earthquakesThe civil protection agency also said that rescue and relief operations are continuing and 332 people have been reported as missing. Saturday’s earthquake of 7.2 magnitude led to the destruction of tens of thousands of buildings and also triggered landslides. Haiti is still continuing to recover from the effects of the earthquake back in 2010 which killed more than 200,000 people.The Les Cayes General Hospital in the Les Cayes city, which is already overwhelmed by regular patients, is also witnessing a large number of injured quake victims being admitted. Several patients had to lie in patios, corridors, verandas and hallways of the hospital due to lack of space. The city has also been battered by continuous rainfall.There is a growing impatience among the quake survivors in Haiti with regard to the sluggish arrival of relief material to the severely affected areas. Reuters reported on Wednesday that dozens of people went to the Les Cayes airport demanding food as a helicopter with supplies arrived there. Police had to intervene to allow a truck carrying the relief aid to leave. There have also been growing concerns for remote places outside Les Cayes, where access roads are damaged, hampering the delivery of such relief material.Also Read| Tropical depression Grace causes torrential rains in Haiti days after earthquakePierre Cenel, a judge in Les Cayes, hit out at the government over its non-preparedness to deal with the calamity. “As a judge, I must not have a political opinion. But as a man, as a man concerned about the situation of my country, nothing is working. They didn’t do anything to prepare for this disaster,” he was quoted as saying by Reuters on Wednesday.Jerry Chandler, the head of the civil protection agency, said that aid was yet to reach many areas, adding officials were working hard to ensure its delivery. Acknowledging the frustration of the people, Chandler urged them to not block convoys so that the agency could do its job. There were at least 600,000 people in need of humanitarian assistance and 135,000 families displaced, he added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/days-after-deadly-earthquake-fresh-tremors-strike-city-in-haiti-101629351690564.html
19-08-2021||World||Canada to resume evacuation flights from Afghanistan soon: Defence minister||Canada has announced that evacuation flights from Afghanistan will resume “shortly”. The country expects to take in as many as 20,000 refugees fleeing the Taliban regime in Kabul.While all Canadian diplomats were evacuated before the Afghan capital fell to the Taliban, rescue operations stalled due to uncertainty over access to the Kabul airport. However, that is now expected to begin as Canada’s defence minister Harjit Sajjan tweeted on Wednesday evening that Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) flights to and from Hamid Karzai International Airport will “resume shortly” under Op AEGIS. That operation is being carried out by the CAF and two CC-177 Globemasters “have been assigned for evacuation efforts and will be flying regularly into Kabul”.“These flights will continue as long as the security situation on the ground permits, and will focus on evacuating Canadians and Afghan nationals who have an enduring relationship with Canada’s mission in Afghanistan,” Sajjan added.The issue that Canada is facing is not just access to the airport but also those seeking to escape being prevented from doing so by the Taliban. This issue was addressed by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as he told reporters that the “limiting factor” was “not paperwork” or “connections with the Canadian government” but “people being unable to get to the airport”.Sajjan said that it was his “absolute priority” to bring Afghan nationals who supported Canada’s mission in the country “to safety” and that the government was “in constant contact with our allies on this urgent matter”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-to-resume-evacuation-flights-from-afghanistan-soon-defence-minister-101629349903993.html

Reports on Indian consulate in Jalalabad and mission in Kabul are not available.Watch: Taliban flaunt weapons, dollars after US, IMF freeze funds amidst Afghan turmoilAccording to reports reaching from Kabul indicate that nearly 6,000 cadre of Haqqani Network have taken control of the capital city led by Anas Haqqani, brother of Sirajuddin Haqqani, head of terrorist group and deputy leader of the Taliban. While Anas Haqqani met former president Hamid Karzai, Chairman HCNR Abdullah Abdullah and Hezb-e-Islami veteran Gulbuddin Hetkmatyar, it is understood that the movements of both Karzai and Abdullah are restricted and controlled by the Taliban. Negotiations are on to ensure to get both Karzai and Abdullah to stage a formal handing over power to the Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Barader in the Presidential Palace. Sirajuddin Haqqani is said to be passing instructions from Quetta.While Haqqani network cadre are largely controlling Kabul, the Taliban faction headed by Mullah Yaqoob, son of late Mullah Omar and head of Taliban military commission, is planning the take over of power and government from Kandahar, the traditional seat of Pashtuns. Mullah Barader met Mullah Yaqoob after he arrived from Doha on August 18. It was here in Kandahar that Mullah Yaqoob’s father was declared Emir ul Momeen on April 4, 1996. The religious head of Taliban, Mullah Haibatullah Akundzada, is still based in Karachi in Pakistan.Although negotiations are on within the Taliban leadership on the formation of government at Kabul, the Pakistan based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), a fellow Deobandi terrorist group, is apparently demanding a stake in the Afghan pie with jagirs or land in south Afghanistan. With the ascent of Taliban in Kabul, there is celebration both within the JeM as well as their handlers in Rawalpindi as troves of cash and top of the line US weapons and military vehicles have been seized by the new invaders.While India and its close allies are in a wait and watch mode, the Taliban are getting support from Britain whose Chief of Defence Staff General Nick Carter is openly lobbying for the Sunni Pashtun group to be given a chance at Kabul. It was Carter along with Pakistan Army who were instrumental in cutting out a botched up deal for the US with the Taliban through special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/haqqani-network-cadres-control-kabul-mullah-yaqoob-in-kandahar-101629347132112.html

It conveys emotions instantly and sometimes more effectively than words. With the rapid advancements in camera technology, it has become one of the primary modes of communication in the digital world.On this day, photographers come together to celebrate the creativity and nuances of photography that captivates us for years.HistoryThe day traces its origins to 1837 when the first-ever photographic process, the ‘Daguerreotype’ was developed by the Frenchmen Louis Daguerre and Joseph Nicephore Niepce. On January 9, 1839, the French Academy of Sciences announced this process, and later in the same year, the French government purchased the patent for the invention and gave it as a gift, "free to the world.”However, the first durable colour photograph was taken in the year 1861 and there is even speculation about the first digital photograph being invented in 1957, 20 years before the invention of the first digital camera.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-photography-day-2021-why-is-it-celebrated-101629346705214.html
19-08-2021||World||'Simple choice': Biden responds to criticism of intelligence failure in Afghanistan||United States President Joe Biden on Wednesday responded to the criticism that the hasty pullout of forces from Afghanistan was a glaring intelligence failure, saying it was "a simple choice". Biden also said that the fallout in Afghanistan following the pullout could not have been handled in a way without "chaos ensuing".In an interview with an American television ABC, Biden was asked whether the situation over the past one week was a result of intelligence, planning, execution, or judgement failure. To this Biden responded by saying that he "doesn't think it was a failure" and it was a simple choice.Biden also pinned the blame on the South Asian nation for the collapse of the Afghan government and meltdown of Afghan forces as he defended himself amid the backlash. "When you had the government of Afghanistan, the leader of that government getting in a plane and taking off and going to another country, when you saw the significant collapse of the Afghan troops we had trained, 300,000 of them, just leaving their equipment and taking off... that's what happened, that's simply what happened," he said during the interview."No, I don't think it could have been handled in a way that, we're going to go back in hindsight and look, but the idea that somehow, there's a way to have gotten out without chaos ensuing, I don't know how that happens," Biden also said.Afghanistan fell into turmoil after the Taliban seized power in the country by capturing a city by city in just 10 days. Since the fall of Kabul over the weekend, scenes of chaos have unfolded as thousands tried to flee, fearing a return to the brutal regime of the Taliban that ended 20 years ago.After the military takeover, the group has also seized huge amounts of weaponry, equipment and munitions from the Afghan armed forces, most of it supplied over the past two decades by the US.Critics say that the US could have prevented the chaos in the country by handling the situation better or delaying the troop pullout. The Biden administration had long promised an "orderly drawdown" of America's longest war, with the president saying US forces no longer have any national interest in fighting in a protracted conflict.Earlier Secretary of State Antony Blinken also said that their mission in Afghanistan has been completed. "We went to Afghanistan 20 years ago, with one mission in mind, and that was to deal with the people who attacked us on 9/11 and that mission has been successful," Blinken said.The US entered Afghanistan in 2001 and ousted the Taliban who were ruling the country since 1996.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/-simple-choice-biden-responds-to-criticism-of-intelligence-failure-in-afghanistan-101629342556897.html
19-08-2021||World||South Korea plans to grant animals legal status to tackle cruelty, abuse||Jin-hui, a cream-coloured Pomeranian, was buried alive and left for dead in 2018 in the South Korean port city of Busan.No charges were filed against its owner at the time, but animal abusers and those who abandon pets will soon face harsher punishment as South Korea plans to amend its civil code to grant animals legal status, Choung Jae-min, the justice ministry's director-general of legal counsel, told Reuters in an interview.The amendment, which must still be approved by parliament, likely during its next regular session in September, would make South Korea one of a handful of countries to recognise animals as beings, with a right to protection, enhanced welfare, and respect for life.The push for the amendment comes as the number of animal abuse cases increased to 914 in 2019 from 69 in 2010, data published by a lawmaker's office showed, and the pet-owning population grew to more than 10 million people in the country of 52 million.South Korea's animal protection law states that anyone who abuses or is cruel to animals may be sentenced to a maximum of three years in prison or fined 30 million won ($25,494), but the standards to decide penalties have been low as the animals are treated as objects under the current legal system, Choung said.Once the Civil Act declares animals are no longer simply things, judges and prosecutors will have more options when determining sentences, he said.The proposal has met with scepticism from the Korea Pet Industry Retail Association, which pointed out there are already laws in place to protect animals."The revision will only call for means to regulate the industry by making it difficult to adopt pets, which will impact greatly not only the industry, but the society as a whole," said the association's director-general, Kim Kyoung-seo.Choung said the amended civil code will also pave the way for follow-up efforts such as life insurance packages for animals and the obligation to rescue and report roadkill.It is likely the amendment will be passed, said lawmaker Park Hong-keun, who heads the animal welfare parliamentary forum, as there is widespread social consensus that animals should be protected and respected as living beings that coexist in harmony with people.Animal rights groups welcomed the justice ministry's plan while calling for stricter penalties for those who abandon or torture animals, as well as a ban on dog meat."Abuse, abandonment, and neglect for pets have not improved in our society," said Cheon Chin-kyung, head of Korea Animal Rights Advocates.Despite a slight drop last year, animal abandonment has risen to 130,401 in 2020 from 89,732 cases in 2016, the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency said. South Korea has an estimated 6 million pet dogs and 2.6 million cats.Solemn with large, sad eyes, Jin-hui, which means "true light" in Korean, now enjoys spending time with other dogs at an animal shelter south of Seoul."Its owner lost his temper and told his kids to bury it alive. We barely managed to save it after a call, but the owner wasn't punished as the dog was recognised as an object owned by him," said Kim Gea-yeung, 55, manager of the shelter."Animals are certainly not objects."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-plans-to-grant-animals-legal-status-to-tackle-cruelty-abuse-101629342443486.html

The multi-ministerial task force tackling the health crisis recently announced that work from home (WFH) will no longer be the default requirement from Thursday. From now on, 50 per cent of employees can return to their workplaces.A majority of the companies are expecting hybrid working arrangements to be a permanent feature of the post-Covid-19 world, according to a report by The Straits Times on Wednesday. A spokesperson for the country’s Public Service Division told The Straits Times that the department was working towards supporting greater work flexibility in the post Covid-19 world. “This will go towards meeting the needs of officers and, at the same time, balancing organisational needs,” the spokesperson added.When Singapore was first hit by Covid-19 in 2020, companies were finding it difficult to make hybrid working conditions possible. In September, the government allowed some workers to return to their offices. However, in May this year, the country once again opted for work from home amid a huge increase in infections.At present, not all companies in Singapore are planning to bring back their employees to offices. According to a report by the Channel News Asia, financial services company Mastercard said its employees could come back to offices, if they wanted to, from August 23. On the other hand, Golin, a public relations agency, also pointed out that its employees could choose until the end of 2021, to return to office or work from home.Apart from easing restrictions for workplaces, Singapore from Thursday will abolish the mandatory temperature checks before entering public places and increase the occupancy limits for shopping malls and showrooms. The operating capacity of cinemas, cruises and libraries will also go up to 50 per cent. Earlier, the government loosened its border restrictions from August 10, allowing entry approvals for fully vaccinated foreign workers and their dependents. Restaurants have resumed dining-in facilities from August 10 and the group size increased to five.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19singapore-to-allow-more-employees-to-return-to-offices-from-today-101629341355629.html
19-08-2021||World||How Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are struggling to keep Taliban at bay||Silicon Valley has a tough job at hand. For the first time in over two decades, social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have to come up with ways to balance a response against the Taliban, a conservative terrorist-affiliated group now in control of the state apparatus in Afghanistan. With the terrorist-affiliated group now on the way to govern an entire country, the social media companies grapple with a set of tough questions - should they maintain their user policies to reflect a strict stance against the insurgents, or enable the Taliban regime to operate on social media as any other internationally-recognised government?For the most part, the social media platforms seem to be taking the no-consideration policy. So far, Facebook and YouTube have said that the Taliban are banned from their platforms, according to US sanctions policies. On the other hand, Twitter has not banned the Taliban yet but is reportedly cracking down on individual pieces of violent content.YouTube, the online video-sharing and social media platform owned by Google, also said that it will terminate Taliban accounts.However, some confusion has been reported among the social media platforms on how to handle the Taliban. Although Facebook claims that its ban on the Taliban has been in place "for years" under its "dangerous organisations" policy, it appears that the social media giant only deactivated certain Taliban accounts after facing a set of questions from the New York Times, according to a tweet by Sheera Frenkel, a reporter for the news organisation.Moreover, Facebook's purported action against Taliban accounts does not seem to have translated across other platforms owned by the company. Facebook-owned instant messaging service WhatsApp said that it will take action against sanctioned people or organisations using the app, but that would involve identifying who uses the app in the first place. A statement by a company spokesperson indicated that WhatsApp has not taken any action against some accounts spreading Taliban propaganda since the platform uses end-to-end encryption for its messages.However, Facebook later said that it would be blocking Taliban accounts on WhatsApp eventually, since it considers the group to be a terrorist organisation. For this purpose, the platform will be taking the help of Afghanistan experts, native Dari, and Pashto speakers with knowledge of the local context, to help guide policy.According to a news report by Politico, the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism -- an industry group launched by Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Microsoft to “to prevent terrorists and violent extremists from exploiting digital platforms” -- has not taken an official position on how to address the Taliban regime's communications on social media, leaving the decision to the individual platforms instead."They (the companies) are struggling a bit," the political journalism company quotes an official at Access Now, a global digital rights advocacy group, as saying. "I don't think people were fully ready for this to happen in Afghanistan. So what's happening is that much more work is having to be done every hour on this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-facebook-twitter-and-youtube-are-struggling-to-keep-taliban-at-bay-101629335313700.html

In the video message, Ghani said these claims are baseless as he was forced to leave to avoid bloodshed. He did not even have the time to change his shoes and left Kabul with the sandals that he was wearing at the Presidential palace on Sunday."Do not believe whoever tells you that your president sold you out and fled for his own advantage and to save his own life," he said adding, "These accusations are baseless... and I strongly reject them.""I was expelled from Afghanistan in such a way that I didn't even get the chance to take my slippers off my feet and pull on my boots," he said.The UAE said it is hosting Ghani on 'humanitarian grounds' after he left Kabul on Sunday after the Taliban entered Kabul and declared an unopposed victory."The UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation can confirm that the UAE has welcomed President Ashraf Ghani and his family into the country on humanitarian grounds," the ministry said in a brief statement. Between Sunday and Wednesday, his location was unknown as various reports said he might have fled to Oman, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, or Lebanon.'Expelled, not fled'Ghani said he had no intention of remaining in exile in Dubai and was in talks to return home. He said he was expelled from Afghanistan and had he stayed in Kabul, then he would have been hanged. "Had I stayed there, an elected president of Afghanistan would have been hanged again right before the Afghans' own eyes," he said.'Taliban had an agreement to not enter Kabul'Ghani said that the Taliban had entered Kabul despite an agreement not to do so. He also said that though he was in favour of a peaceful transition of power, he was expelled from Afghanistan. He backed the talks between the Taliban and former president Hamid Karzai and senior official Abdullah Abdullah and said he wants the success of the process.Ghani no longer a figure in Afghanistan: United StatesAfter Ashraf Ghani said he wants to return to Afghanistan, the United States said it did not see Ashraf Ghani as a player in Afghanistan.

19-08-2021||World||IMF blocks Afghanistan's access to emergency reserves||The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has announced to block Afghanistan's access to the emergency reserve worth USD 460 million as the Taliban's control over the country has drawn uncertainty for the country's future, a media report said.The decision followed pressure from the Biden administration to ensure that the reserves did not reach the Taliban, New York Times reported.On Tuesday, the Biden administration also froze about USD 9.5 billion of Afghan reserves to keep cash away from the Taliban after it captured Afghanistan.US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and personnel at the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control had decided to freeze the accounts, Dawn reported citing The Washington Post."Any central bank assets the Afghan government have in the United States will not be made available to the Taliban," an administration official told the newspaper in a statement.According to the report, the US State Department, alongwith the White House, was consulted before the action adding that the Biden administration was contemplating other actions as well to pressure the Taliban, reported Dawn.The terror group took control over Afghanistan on Sunday after entering the presidential palace in Kabul.The Taliban leaders are discussing future government plans in Doha and are in touch with the international community and intra-Afghan parties to make government in Afghanistan.The world is closely watching the unfolding situation in Afghanistan as the countries have scrambled to evacuate its citizen from Afghanistan in an attempt to secure their people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-blocks-afghanistan-s-access-to-emergency-reserves-101629330592343.html
19-08-2021||World||3 killed as Taliban face first protests; airlifts ramped up||At least three people were killed in anti-Taliban protests in the Afghan city of Jalalabad on Wednesday, witnesses said, as the militant group moved to create a government and Western countries ramped up evacuations from a chaotic Kabul airport.The deaths mar the Taliban’s efforts to consolidate Islamist rule and their promises of peace following their sweep into the capital. They have said they will not take revenge against old enemies and will respect the rights of women within the framework of Islamic law.The witnesses said the deaths in Jalalabad took place when local residents tried to install Afghanistan’s national flag at a square in the city, some 150km from the capital on the main road to Pakistan.There were also more than a dozen people injured after Taliban militants opened fire on protesters in the eastern city, two witnesses and a former police official told Reuters.Video footage also showed the Taliban firing into the air and attacking people with batons to disperse the crowd. Babrak Amirzada, a reporter for a local news agency, said he and a TV camera aman from another agency were beaten up by the Taliban as they tried to cover the unrest. Taliban spokesmen were not immediately reachable for comment.The Jalalabad incident also had a domino effect, and protests soon spread to other regions, reports said. Hundreds took to the streets in Khost province in the east, according to Al-Jazeera.It was a rare resistance to their rule. In the days since the Taliban seized Kabul on Sunday, the militants faced one other protest by a few women in the capital.Meanwhile, videos from the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul, a stronghold of the Northern Alliance militias that allied with the US against the Taliban in 2001, appear to show potential opposition figures gathering there. It is the only province that hasn’t yet fallen to the Taliban.Those figures include members of the deposed government — vice-president Amrullah Saleh, who asserted on Twitter that he is the country’s rightful president, and defence minister General Bismillah Mohammadi — as well as Ahmad Massoud, the son of the slain Northern Alliance leader Ahmad Shah Massoud. It’s unclear if they intend to challenge the Taliban, which seized most of the country in a matter of days last week.The Taliban, meanwhile, pressed ahead with their efforts to form an “inclusive, Islamic government”. They have been holding talks with former president Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, a senior official in the ousted government. Mohammad Yusof Saha, a spokesperson for Karzai, said preliminary meetings with Taliban officials would facilitate eventual negotiations with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the top Taliban political leader, who returned to the country this week.Chaotic evacuations, chaos outsideAmid the uncertainty, thousands of Afghans have tried to flee the country in recent days, and the US and its allies have struggled to manage a chaotic withdrawal from the country.Taliban commanders and soldiers fired into the air on Wednesday to disperse the crowds outside the airport, a Taliban official said. “We have no intention to injure anyone,” he said.About 5,000 diplomats, security staff, aid workers and Afghans have been evacuated from Kabul in the last 24 hours, a Western official said on Wednesday.The evacuations by military flights will continue around the clock, he said, adding that clearing the chaos outside the airport was a challenge. “It’s absolutely hectic and chaos out there.” the official said.US troops guarding the evacuation effort from Afghanistan at Kabul airport also fired some shots in the air overnight to control the crowds, but there were no indications of casualties or injuries, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said on Wednesday at a press briefing.Symbolic returnOne of the Taliban’s leaders and co-founders, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, returned to Afghanistan for the first time in more than 10 years and a Taliban official said the leaders would show themselves to the world, unlike in the past when they lived in secret.“Slowly, gradually, the world will see all our leaders,” the senior Taliban official said.The Taliban’s first news briefing since their return to Kabul suggested they would impose their laws more softly than during their harsh 1996-2001 rule. Women would be allowed to work and study and “will be very active in society but within the framework of Islam”, Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban’s main spokesperson, said.Many Afghans are afraid. Many said they could only wait and see.“My family lived under the Taliban and maybe they really want to change or have changed but only time will tell,” said Ferishta Karimi, who runs a tailoring shop for women.The Taliban have promised to maintain security, but residents say groups of armed men have been going door to door inquiring about Afghans who worked with the Americans or the deposed government. It’s unclear if the gunmen are Taliban or criminals posing as militants.On Wednesday, the United Arab Emirates also acknowledged that President Ashraf Ghani, who fled the country as the Taliban closed in last week, and his family were in the Gulf country. “The UAE has welcomed President Ashraf Ghani and his family into the country on humanitarian grounds,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-killed-as-taliban-face-first-protests-airlifts-ramped-up-101629314715772.html
19-08-2021||World||BRICS reiterates commitment to foster open, fair and non-discriminatory trade environment||The industry ministers of Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa (BRICS) reiterated their commitment to foster an open, fair, and non-discriminatory trade environment to ensure greater participation in global value chains by promoting digital inclusion and encouraging the sustainable use of disruptive technologies for advancing growth.India, chairing the 5th meeting of BRICS industry ministers, expressed its desire to expand the horizon of the New Development Bank (NDB) in strengthening social infrastructure besides promoting the industrial sector. The ministers agreed to collaborate with the NDB. The multilateral financial institution became fully operational in 2016 with an aim to mobilise resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS and other emerging economies.BRICS ministers recognised the unprecedented impact of the Covid-19 pandemic particularly on the trade and industry, an official statement said. The virtual meeting was chaired by India’s minister of commerce and industry Piyush Goyal on Wednesday. It was attended by Chinese minister of industry Xiao Yaqing, South African trade minister Ebrahim Patel, Brazil’s deputy minister for economy Carlos Da Costa and Russian industry minister Denis Manturov.India chose the theme “BRICS@15: Intra BRICS Cooperation for Continuity, Consolidation and Consensus “ this year.In his welcome address, Goyal said India has also been working towards channelising technology towards good and smart governance thus increasing transparency and accountability.He said India has developed a vibrant and dynamic start-up ecosystem, leveraged existing platforms and digital technologies such as Aadhaar and unified payment interface (UPI) for ensuring delivery of critical services to the last mile. Online systems like COWIN and digital vaccination certificates are being cited as success stories across the world today, the statement quoting the minister said.Goyal said in this swiftly changing world, the group’s adaptability to new and emerging technologies like Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, 3-D Manufacturing and other processes will determine the success of its efforts to embrace Industry 4.0.Industry 4.0 will play a crucial role in helping BRICS economies in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). However, there are challenges of data protection and cybersecurity too. Therefore, it is essential to manage the transition to new technologies in line with national policies and legislation. This understanding is at the heart of the BRICS cooperation agenda, he said.Goyal said emerging technologies would be an indispensable part of almost all activities, including manufacturing. This requires us to increase our pace towards the adoption of new technologies to develop sustainable industrial cooperation. He said that the adoption of new technologies by micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) would play a crucial role in achieving the target of inclusiveness.“Our partnership would be successful if we as a group, on the basis of consensus, complement strengths of each other, share our best practices and learn from our weaknesses,” the statement quoting Goyal said.He said the horizon of NDB should be expanded and resources the be utilized for strengthening social infrastructure especially for funding service delivery in the education and health sector, besides the promotion of infrastructure and industrial sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brics-reiterates-commitment-to-foster-open-fair-and-non-discriminatory-trade-environment-101629314862224.html
