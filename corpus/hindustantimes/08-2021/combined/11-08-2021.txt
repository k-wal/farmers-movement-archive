According to senior officials, each private hospital has been notified to test at least 12 samples of suspected cases this year. The health department, on the other hand, has collected about 489 samples at their flu clinics. So far, only a single case of malaria has been detected while zero dengue cases have been detected.“Both government and private hospitals have been directed to increase the sampling of the suspected case as it is the time when cases of malaria and dengue cases begin to emerge. Sample collection will be increased in some hotspot areas where cases were detected in the last few years,” Dr Sudha Garg, deputy civil surgeon for vector-borne diseases, said.A meeting was also held between the deputy civil surgeon and deputy commissioner Yash Garg on Tuesday evening to discuss the Covid-19 pandemic and changing weather conditions.At least 48 cases of malaria were reported in 2017, 30 in 2018, 15 in 2019 and four in 2020. The health department collected over 190,940 blood samples from January till August to identify cases. In the case of dengue, at least 66 cases were reported in 2017, while 93 were reported in 2018, 22 in 2019 and 51 in 2020.The deputy commissioner also directed the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram for residual spray and larvicidal activities on a large scale, including in all slum areas, industries and construction sites. The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) was asked to do GIS mapping of all water bodies and hotspot areas from past data.Sultan Singh, head, GIS mapping, GMDA, said, “Since 2016, we have been identifying hotspots which have helped in controlling the spread of vector-borne diseases. Areas in old Gurugram are prone to malaria and dengue. Other areas like Chakkarpur and Palam Vihar are also equally vulnerable due to frequent waterlogging. Based on the heat map prepared by the GMDA, other departments like MCG and health department conduct spraying and sample collection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/health-dept-directs-hospitals-to-increase-testing-for-vector-borne-diseases-101628706034050.html
11-08-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19: Teams to conduct physical inspection of beds in private hospitals||The district health department on Wednesday constituted 10 teams of doctors, including members from the Indian Medical Association (IMA), to audit bed capacity in private hospitals, almost a month after the hospitals submitted details about the total number of beds that can be reserved for Covid-19 patients during an anticipated third wave.“The committees have been constituted for performing physical verification of hospital beds in private hospitals. Each team will comprise two doctors, including a representative from the health department and IMA, who will visit about 38 big hospitals in the city. About 10 teams will visit three to four hospitals each and submit their reports by August 20,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer of Gurugram.Even as the health department has been reporting a constant decline in new cases of coronavirus infection over the past two months, private hospitals were directed to augment bed capacity for children and infants in June. At least 76 hospitals were directed to increase the bed capacity by 10% to treat neonatal, infants and young children.Officials said that the move is aimed at ensuring efficient treatment to patients. On Tuesday, private hospitals were directed to constitute a committee to monitor oxygen requirement, usage and wastage for every bed. The directions are being issued to cope with a sharp rise in cases, as the second wave alone added more than 100,000 new cases in April and May.With the festival season around the corner, which can lead to an increase in cases, the health department is in the process of ensuring timely bed availability and oxygen supply to patients.Based on the details submitted by hospitals, the district has 686 paediatric beds supported with oxygen supply, at least 172 paediatric intensive care unit (ICU) beds with ventilators, and 391 paediatric ICU beds without ventilators. For adults, over 3,837 beds have been reserved, of which 2,817 are equipped with oxygen support, 759 are ICU beds and 261 are equipped with ventilators.Since there has been a decline in the new Covid-19 cases, only six critically ill patients of the 74 active cases from Gurugram are undergoing treatment at hospitals. On Wednesday, the district reported four new Covid-19 cases and zero deaths. The death toll stands at 921 and the total case count at 180,958.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-teams-to-conduct-physical-inspection-of-beds-in-private-hospitals-101628706032970.html

It is the responsibility of the developers to create distribution infrastructure inside the colonies. The connections were stopped because, despite repeated directions, the developers did not take corrective action,” said PC Meena, the newly appointed managing director of DHBVN, who took charge on August 1.“We don’t want homebuyers or residents to suffer but the developers will have to follow the rules. This matter will be resolved soon,” Meena said.Pradeep Kumar Chauhan, superintending engineer, Gurugram circle II, said that fresh connections were stopped in these colonies on July 2 as developers failed to create requisite infrastructure despite repeated notices. “We have been asking these developers to build the necessary electricity infrastructure since 2013 but it has not happened. We continued to issue fresh connections till last month. The developers will have to do the needful,” he said.DHBVN officials also said that in several cases, developers were misusing the temporary connections that were issued for construction purposes.A senior DHBVN official based in Gurugram, wishing not to be identified, said that the recently Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission questioned the department about the issuance of electricity connections despite the lack of adequate electricity infrastructure.A large number of residents have also repeatedly taken to social media platforms to complain about the issue. The buyers/builders in these colonies are not getting temporary connections for constructions and the process of getting a temporary connection after depositing money for transformers has also stopped, they alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/power-dept-stops-new-connections-to-16-colonies-that-lack-infrastructure-101628706031371.html
11-08-2021||Gurugram||GMDA to start road repairs after monsoon||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority will start repairing four key sector-dividing roads from September, as part of a larger road repair project, following several complaints of potholes, partial constructions and lack of footpath demarcations, officials said on Wednesday.The four roads are part of a citywide road maintenance project that has been pending for the past three years. Tenders for the work, which is expected to cost over ₹8.5 crore, have been floated and a deadline of August 30 is set for submission of bids, officials said.The repair work will start with roads dividing sectors 45 and 52, 46 and 51, 47 and 49, and 46 and 47, which connect six sectors and witness a collective footfall of around 50,000 commuters every day, officials said.MR Sharma, the chief engineer for infrastructure 1 division of the GMDA, said, “These four roads are the connection points for around six sectors, where the traffic movement is also high. We have been getting complaints from commuters regarding potholes, partially constructed roads and footpaths not being demarcated properly. So, we have decided to fix these issues after the monsoon.”Sharma said that all roads under the GMDA will be repaired and that maintenance work has been pending for three years. The maintenance work is scheduled to be completed within six months, he said. The GMDA has a total road network of roughly 270 kilometres under its jurisdiction, of the total 1,267 kilometres in the district, as per a Haryana Vision Zero report. At present, around 10 repair works and road maintenance projects are already under process, according to the status of projects available on the GMDA’s official website. These projects include repair of both service roads from Huda City Centre to Subhash Chowk; repair of Old Railway Road, repair of dividing road of sectors 27 and 28, 43 and 53, and 42 and 54.Officials had said that repair and maintenance work got delayed due to pending approvals and the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. Last week, the chief executive officer of GMDA had said that work on several projects is likely to be completed by the end of this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gmda-to-start-road-repairs-after-monsoon-101628705971818.html
11-08-2021||Chandigarh||If prime facie case is made out, charges can be framed: CBI on Hooda’s plea in AJL case||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) told high court that at the time of framing of charge, a trial court is to prima facie consider whether there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.lf the court is satisfied that a prima-facie case is made out for proceeding further then a charge has to be framed, the agency said on a plea filed by former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda.On July 1, the high court bench of justice Arvind Sangwan had stayed trial against the former Haryana CM and Associated Journal Limited (AJL), which is the publisher of National Herald newspaper, for alleged illegal allotment of a plot in Panchkula to AJL.Charges were framed by a special CBI court, Panchkula, against Hooda and AJL on April 16, an order challenged by Hooda.The trial court had acted on a CBI chargesheet filed in December 2018. The FIR was registered in 2016 during the BJP regime for the alleged offences of 2005 when the Congress leader was the CM.The CBI has also brought to the knowledge of the court an order passed by the Supreme Court as per which trials against former and sitting legislators are being monitored by high court to ensure timely disposal.CBI has alleged that Hooda and late Moti Lal Vora had entered into a criminal conspiracy and misused their official position by ordering re-allotment of a plot at old rates and causing wrongful loss of ₹62 lakh to the government.This was done by Hooda even as there were notings from officials that if an allotment is to be made, it has to be on new rates, CBI has argued submitting that there was enough material on record for a trial court to take cognisance and frame charges against Hooda and AJL.At the time of registration of the FIR, late Moti Lal Vora was the chairman of AJL and Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul Gandhi were among the shareholders. The newspaper was launched in 1938 by India’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. An Enforcement Directorate (ED) probe is also underway in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/if-prime-facie-case-is-made-out-charges-can-be-framed-cbi-on-hooda-s-plea-in-ajl-case-101628705854235.html

11-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to provide 1% reservation to orphans in government jobs and education||The Maharashtra government has decided to provide 1% reservation to orphans in government jobs and education. The decision was cleared in the state cabinet meeting held on Wednesday. The policy was first formulated in 2018 but could not be implemented owing to technical difficulties which have been removed, said state women and child development minister Yashomati Thakur.She also declared that the state would provide jobs to all candidates who appeared for examinations for government jobs but could not get it owing to delay in results. “All those, who have appeared for exams but could get it because of delay in declaring results, will now be accommodated in the government jobs,” Thakur told reporters at Sahyadri guest house after cabinet meeting.In the revised policy, the state government has divided orphans into three categories: A, B and C. The first two categories are eligible for reservation in government jobs and educational schemes while those in the third category will be eligible only for educational schemes, officials said.The 1% reservation to orphans will be provided based on the total number of positions in jobs and number of seats in admissions. Criteria such as age, educational qualifications etc. for becoming eligible under the policy is similar to the existing norms determined for Scheduled Caste category, said a senior official from women and child development department.“The state was facing difficulties in providing the same benefits to all kinds of orphans, and thus made the desired changes, making it feasible,” said another senior official, wishing not to be named.According to the revised policy, orphans who have no idea about their parents, siblings, relatives, village, address, etc. will fall in the first (A) category. Those who have lost their parents, and whose documents do not mention their caste or those who do not have a caste certificate, and orphans brought up at orphanages will come under the second (B) category. Those who have lost their parents before adulthood and were brought up by relatives and have details of their caste will fall in the last (C) category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-provide-1-reservation-to-orphans-in-government-jobs-and-education-101628705491318.html
11-08-2021||Mumbai||Allotment of Mumbai local train passes: 23,251 season tickets issued on Day 1||On Day 1 of the offline verification process for train travel for the fully vaccinated from August 15, the railways issued 23,251 monthly season tickets till 6pm on Wednesday – 16,798 by the Central Railway (CR) and 6,453 by the Western Railway (WR). While Dombivli topped in the passes on the CR (1,217), on the WR, Borivli saw the maximum number of railway passes being issued (449). The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), until 3pm on Wednesday, verified documents of 18,324 citizens at 358 helpdesks across 53 railway stations. The BMC was yet to compile the details of the number of documents verified and passes issued in the second shift (3pm to 7pm), at the time of going to press. Although there were queues of fully vaccinated citizens at railway stations across the city, no crowding was reported at any station, said officials. Among those availing the facility were citizens from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, as each city in the MMR gave permission for train travel. On Tuesday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced that fully vaccinated beneficiaries can travel by local trains from August 15 onwards, provided they have completed 14 days after the second dose of their vaccine shots and their documents have been verified by the BMC. Subsequently, the BMC announced on Tuesday evening that the offline verification process will start at 53 railway stations from Wednesday. The helpdesks set up by the civic body will stay open between 7am and 11pm daily, in two shifts. The Central and the Western Railway will operate 617 booking offices between 7am and 11pm everyday till August 15 to facilitate passengers. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner and incharge of the BMC’s health department, who is overseeing these operations, conducted rounds of some railway stations in the city on Wednesday morning. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G-North ward, with jurisdiction over Dadar Terminus, said, “Operations have been going on smoothly at helpdesks at Dadar. There was no crowding at the station, as citizens have also realised there is time to get such passes issued. Helpdesks will stay open daily until further notice.” The BMC is also in the process of making the verification procedure available online. “We had expected the number of passengers to increase by 6pm, but that did not happen,” said a senior CR official. A senior civic official said, “As fully vaccinated citizens also have to wait for a period of 14 days after their second shot before applying for passes, the sample size of fully vaccinated beneficiaries also opting for a train pass may be small. Among those fully vaccinated, those who want to take the train as well may be a small number. We are yet to see how many passengers will opt for train travel.” Suburban railway passengers welcomed the move. “I got my monthly railway pass smoothly in five minutes. My office got me vaccinated as soon as the vaccination process began. However, my friends will still have to suffer and pay more to commute as they have not got their second dose of vaccine,” said Aslam Shaikh, a Kurla resident. According to the data from the BMC, a total of 1,914,771 beneficiaries have been fully vaccinated as of Tuesday evening. Of these, 297,377 are healthcare and frontline workers; 646,939 are citizens above 60 years of age; 811,709 are in the 45-60 age group; 140,944 are in the 18-45 age group; 721 are lactating mothers; eight are pregnant women; 16,889 are students or professionals looking to travel abroad, or those who were participating in Tokyo Olympics; 136 are physically or mentally differently abled; 26 are without identity proofs (prisoners/transgender persons); and 22 are bedridden beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/allotment-of-mumbai-local-train-passes-23-251-season-tickets-issued-on-day-1-101628705371707.html
11-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: No Covid vaccination drive at centres today and tomorrow||The vaccination drive at public centres in Mumbai is suspended for Thursday and Friday due to shortage of vaccines, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said in a statement on Wednesday. Meanwhile, many centres witnessed longer queues than usual on Tuesday and Wednesday, in light of the decision to allow fully vaccinated citizens to travel on local trains from August 15. New stock of vaccine doses is expected to arrive by Thursday night and will be distributed to all centres on Friday. Vaccination will resume at public centres in the city on Saturday, August 14. The BMC last received 45,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses on Saturday night and has not received any stock since. On Wednesday, 39,538 beneficiaries were vaccinated in the city, of which 11,758 received their second dose and 27,779 were vaccinated with their first dose. Among those who received their second dose, 66 are healthcare and frontline workers, 2,168 are citizens above the age of 60, 4,574 are citizens in the 45-60 age group, 4,817 are in the 18-45 age group, 134 are students or professionals travelling internationally.

There are over 430 vaccine centres in the city, of which 294 are operated by the civic body, and 20 by the state and Central government. Dr Rajesh Dere, dean of the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) jumbo facility, said, “On Wednesday morning, the vaccination centre at BKC saw longer queues. This has been the case for the past two three days. As a majority of the city’s population travels by local trains, many beneficiaries whose second dose is due are rushing to take it. Moreover, news of shortage of vaccine doses has also prompted people to turn up at the vaccine centre early for the walk-in facility.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaino-covid-vaccination-drive-at-centres-today-and-tomorrow-101628704951591.html
11-08-2021||Mumbai||Two weeks after court order, MU final-year law students still await mark sheets||Announcement of the results for final-year law courses brought relief to the students but their wait for physical mark sheets is seemingly never-ending, despite the University of Mumbai (MU) assuring students in the Bombay high court (HC) that mark sheets would be distributed by August 11.“The varsity should be held for contempt of court for not adhering to their own promise in court. It has been two weeks and we still have no idea when the mark sheets will be ready,” said a law student.Last year, due to increasing Covid-19 cases and the subsequent lockdown, all university students, except final-semester students, were promoted to the next semester based on their performance. Results for semester-2 and 4 of the three-year LLB course and semester-2, 4, 6 and 8 of the five-year LLB course were announced based on the average scores of previous semesters and internal assessment marks. These results were announced in August 2020 and several of these students have already cleared the semester after that. On July 5 this year, law students were in for a shock after the university released a circular nullifying the August 2020 results and instead directed colleges to hold assignment-based evaluation as per a set schedule to declare results once again. Students were asked to complete two assignments in each subject for 50 marks, and the scores obtained would have been extrapolated to the scale of 60 or 100, whichever applicable. Students raised this matter in the HC and a final decision came through on July 28, when the university published a new circular nullifying the July 5 circular and assured the court that results and mark sheets will be distributed within two weeks.A day after this announcement, on July 29, University declared results for semester-10 and 6 of the five-year and three-year law courses, respectively. The success rate of semester-10 students stood at 97.36%, while that of semester-6 students stood at 98.62%, MU stated in a press release.“Many of us have applied for jobs, which we cannot join till we submit the mark sheet. Similarly, some of us are in need of the physical mark sheet in order to apply for higher education. The university needs to understand our plight,” said Ankit Gada, another student.“Mark sheets are ready and some colleges have already collected the same. Students will receive mark sheets soon,” said an official from MU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/two-weeks-after-court-order-mu-final-year-law-students-still-await-mark-sheets-101628704891417.html

Major improvement works, including converting four-lane roads to six-lane ones, will also be done.Officials said that tenders have been floated for the project and it is expected to take a year-and-a-half for the structures to be constructed. These will be designed for a speed of 100 kmph.Ajay Arya, project director, NHAI said that the bids will be opened on September 14. “The two structures at Manesar and Bilaspur, besides other bridges and structures, will greatly improve commute on the entire highway. Heavy congestion is witnessed in these areas and the number of accidents has been high as several state highways and main roads converge at these spots,” said Arya.NHAI officials said adequate pedestrian facilities, streetlighting, drainage and other safety structures would also be set up.With the primary focus on improving safety at these locations, NHAI officials said that adequate traffic control devices and road safety works will also be created. These include roadside signs, overhead signs and curb mounted signs along the identified stretches. The structures will also have a provision for W-beam crash barriers along the identified stretches at high embankment locations, officials said.Currently, the condition of roads at several locations on this highway is not ideal with proper maintenance works lacking, regular commuters on the roads connecting Gurugram, Rewari and Narnaul said.Vishal Bansal, a resident of Narnaul, who frequently travels on the highway, said that the new bridges on Gurugram and Rajasthan side will reduce commute time and also check accidents. “We get stuck at Bilaspur and Manesar regularly. Another bad spot is Dharuhera and NHAI should do something about that also,” he said.Due to heavy congestion and a high number of accidents, residents of Manesar, Bilaspur and Rewari have been demanding flyover on both these stretches.Union minister and Gurugram Lok Sabha member, Rao Inderjit Singh, said that he had taken up the matter of flyovers at Bilaspur and Manesar repeatedly with union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, who approved these projects a few weeks ago. “Traffic congestion on the entire highway is high and there are frequent traffic jams. The NHAI has finally floated the tenders and I hope the work will be completed at a fast pace. The accidents happening on this stretch will also reduce,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/nhai-to-construct-flyovers-at-manesar-and-bilaspur-101628704051276.html

Pithani was subsequently picked from Hyderabad and produced before a Telangana court that had granted them transit remand to bring him to Mumbai.Pithani was the first person to see the actor’s body hanging from the ceiling on September 14, 2020. Hi statement was recorded by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) as well as Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) which is the investigating the suicide case of the actor.Advocate Taraq Sayed, for Pithani, had claimed that Pithani had co-operated with the investigators from time to time, and that he was falsely implicated and there was no evidence against him. However, the court rejected his bail application.Rajput’s former girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik were also arrested in a drug case for procuring marijuana and were granted bail.

11-08-2021||Mumbai||Chaos at Kalyan station on Day 1 of railway pass allotment||On the first day of the verification of documents for allotting local train monthly pass, the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) verified documents of 2,506 commuters till 3pm on Wednesday at Kalyan, Dombivli, Titwala, Ambivli, Shahad, Thakurli and Kopar railway stations.As per the data collected from the seven railway stations, a total of 617 passes were issued in all these stations till 3pm. Similarly, 1,394 documents were verified at four stations of Diva, Mumbra, Kalwa and Thane by the Thane Municipal Corporation.Long queues were seen outside Kalyan and Dombivli stations from 6am on the backdrop of trains operating for fully vaccinated commuters from August 15. While some commuters were clueless about the procedure for the verification and allotment of passes, some had carried all the documents related to their identification and vaccination.“I have carried the vaccination certificate and my identification card. They were also asking for the Xerox copy of the ID card, which I didn’t have. It was not mentioned anywhere that the Xerox copy of the ID card was required. Moreover, we have to queue up twice, once for verification and the second time for getting the pass. This wastes a lot of time,” said Mahajan Surve, 40, one of the commuters at Kalyan railway station.The Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) has deployed a dedicated team of ward officers, deputy commissioner and other staff members at the seven railway stations falling under its jurisdiction in two shifts, from 7am to 3pm and from 3pm to 11pm.Suhas Gupte, ward officer managing the counter at Dombivli station, said, “Today is the first day of verification and people have started arriving at the counter since morning. People are coming with the soft copies of their documents which will not be considered. They should bring the hard copies so that we can stamp on them. These will be further verified by the railway staff for allotting the pass.” Crowd better managed in ThaneWith six helpdesks at Thane, Kalwa, Mumbra and Diva stations, the crowd was well managed by the Thane Municipal Corporation at the railway stations.For Rajesh Jain, a resident of Tembhi Naka in Thane who travels to Crawford Market on a daily basis, getting a railway pass after a year-and-a-half was a relief. “I was fully vaccinated more than a month ago, so I could showcase my certificate and got a railway pass on Wednesday morning itself. There was no rush and the queue and verification counters were well organised. Currently, I am travelling by bus, which is expensive and time consuming as well. From next week I can take the train.”Dr Vipin Sharma, Thane Municipal Corporation commissioner, said, “The verification facility is available from 7am to 11pm and employees of TMC were given training on Tuesday. Those who are eligible and want to travel on a regular basis can avail the pass facility. I appeal to the residents to maintain social distancing and avoid crowding.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/chaos-at-kalyan-station-on-day-1-of-railway-pass-allotment-101628701531347.html
11-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Despite objection, BMC seeks green nod for Deonar waste-to-energy project||Despite stiff opposition from residents and environmentalists, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on August 6 moved a proposal before the state environment department seeking environment clearance (EC) for its proposed 4MW waste-to-energy (WTE) plant at the Deonar dumping ground. The BMC’s proposal — file number SIA/MH/MIS/47692/2019 — has been accepted by the state environment impact assessment authority (SEIAA) and is currently under examination by the state-level expert appraisal committee (EAC).BMC’s application for a green nod follows an online public hearing held on April 27, during which the project was met with criticism from those in attendance, particularly people living near the landfill. The minutes of the public hearing (which have been reviewed by Hindustan Times) does not reflect the widespread nature of the objections raised and have instead been drafted in a question-and-answer format which suggests that citizens’ queries regarding the project have been resolved.Several participants had pointed out that the WTE model has seen little success in other parts of the country, and should not be replicated in Mumbai. “Our main contention was that this project will not solve the problem of waste dumping in Deonar. On the contrary, we need to enforce source segregation. The minutes of the public hearing does not reflect any cognisance of the ecological pitfalls of this waste to the energy model. We had also requested that the public hearing itself be postponed to another date given that we were in the middle of a surge in Covid cases in April. That request was cleanly denied,” said environmentalist Anand Pendharkar.The broad argument posited by environmentalists was that the WTE model incentivises the production of waste instead of focusing on source segregation. Across Europe and even China, they had noted, WTE plants are being proactively shut down because they emit carcinogenic dioxins and furans. Moreover, given poor waste management practices in Indian cities, the calorific value of waste is low making it unsuitable for incineration and all the more harmful, emissions wise.“One important point which has not been reflected in that the draft environmental impact assessment (EIA) report was not made widely available before hearing. It is stated in the minutes that copies of the report were available at certain offices, but how are citizens, especially those who will be affected most by the project, supposed to know this? The report should have been placed online,” said Bilal Khan, a social worker who has been engaged with the local community living around Deonar for several years.Khan had pointed out, during the public hearing, that only 100 people were in attendance for the consultation whereas the population of the M East ward is at least nine lakh. “It is not acceptable to push a project without conducting any ground-level engagement,” Khan added. BMC officials, however, cited the ongoing pandemic as a hurdle and said that all rules of the union environment ministry related to public consultations have been followed in the matter.“All comments, feedback and objections have been duly noted. The expert appraisal committee will consider them and take appropriate action,” said Minesh Pimple, deputy chief engineer, solid waste management (projects), BMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaidespite-objection-bmc-seeks-green-nod-for-deonar-waste-to-energy-project-101628701291157.html
11-08-2021||Mumbai||Silence on lifting 50% quota cap exposed charade of BJP, say Sena MPs||Backed into the corner by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over quota issues for Maratha community in Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena on Wednesday hit back saying the silence of BJP Members of Parliament (MPs) from Maharashtra on the 50% cap has “exposed their hidden motives”. Sena MPs added that the BJP used the Maratha quota issue to target the Uddhav Thackeray-led state government but the “charade” has been exposed.Sena MPs in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha backed the 127th amendment, which restored the power of state governments to identify Other Backward Classes (OBC) that are socially and economically backward, but sought an amendment allowing the states to go over the 50% ceiling. The amendment was necessitated after the Supreme Court (SC) in its order on Maratha reservations upheld the 102nd Constitutional Amendment Act that inserted articles 338B and 342A (with two clauses) after article 342 which said the President of India, in consultation with governors, would specify socially and economically backward classes, taking away the power of state governments to do so.Sena MPs launched an offensive on its former ally in New Delhi, saying the criticism of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) was to shift blame from the Centre to the state government. Vinayak Raut, Sena MP and its leader in Lok Sabha, said the BJP’s concern for Marathas and Dhangars was a “charade”, and the party has lost the moral right to speak on quota for the communities.“In the words of Devendra Fadnavis, a bill should be ‘fool-proof’ (Fadnavis had used the term for state’s quota for Maratha community), and therefore the Sena had suggested amendment in the said bill to allow states to go over the 50% cap on reservations. When the amendment was put to vote, all parties including the Congress backed it but the hidden motives of one party, the BJP which had been criticising the state government on the reservations for various communities, were exposed,” Raut told reporters in New Delhi.The MP from Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg further added, “BJP’s concern for Dhangar and Marathas was a charade, which is now clear, after they did not back the amendment in Lok Sabha. Those who were speaking for Maratha and Dhangar communities have acted in a complete opposite manner in the Lok Sabha. The BJP has lost the moral right to speak on quota for Maratha and Dhangar communities.”South Mumbai MP and former Union minister Arvind Sawant said, “In the last year or so, MVA and Uddhav Thackeray were constantly targeted [on Maratha reservations issue]. A picture was being created that the state is not taking any constructive steps, and that they (BJP) have brought the reservation, but it did not stand in the courts. The bill brought in the Parliament has exposed that the criticism was false. It was always in the hands of the Centre and now it has gone back to the states.” Speaking in Rajya Sabha, Sena MP Sanjay Raut called the bill incomplete and of no use till the cap is lifted. “This bill is not a complete one. Till you remove the ceiling of 50% quota, it is of no use. [BJP MP] Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje is here, he was the leader of the agitation from the community. Today, even he feels that the 50% cap should increase.”Vinayak Raut said the 127th amendment bill, which was passed in Lok Sabha on Tuesday, was “very vague” which can “raise several issues” later. He said, “The states must have the right to exceed the 50% limit based on the backward class commission’s reports... None of the states will benefit from this amendment because if they have to give reservations to communities in their states they will have to go over 50% cap.”Responding to the criticism, BJP leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said, “The Opposition had demanded Constitutional amendment on the reservations. They supported the bill in Parliament but now criticise it outside. This is their tactic to create an environment of doubt among the community.” Despite attempts, Union minister of state and Maratha leader Raosaheb Danve was not available for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/silence-on-lifting-50-quota-cap-exposed-charade-of-bjp-say-sena-mps-101628701172972.html

He was stabbed by five persons who had booked his cab on August 1 and threw his body in the Ghat. All the five accused fled to Uttar Pradesh. The police arrested Aman Gautam (27), Rahulkumar Gautam (24) and Dharmendra Gautam (27) while Karan Gautam (28) and Bachai Gautam (24) are still absconding.Police inspector ST Jadhav said, “The crime was hatched by Aman with the sole purpose of stealing the car. All the five are from the same village in UP. They allegedly stabbed Gave multiple times. They threw both his body and the weapon used in the trench and escaped with the car.”Gave was the sole breadwinner of his family that included three children and his wife. He did several odd jobs to earn a living during the lockdown, one of which was driving.“The body was completely decomposed when we removed it from a 70-foot deep trench. It was stuck on a tree for almost nine days after the driver died. The body has been sent for post-mortem for further details.

11-08-2021||Mumbai||Is 1994 Pune ring road plan still feasible: Bombay HC asks state||The Bombay high court (HC) has sought to know from the Maharashtra government as to whether the plan for a ring road in and around Pune, conceived in the regional town development plan in 1994, was still a techno-economically feasible project in 2021.The court sought state’s response in plea by a developer seeking reliefs and directions to the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) to withdraw the order restraining Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) from issuing Occupancy and Completion Certificates to the developer who constructed a structure on the land meant for the ring road and even sold the units therein.The HC further sought to know from the state the time it would take to demarcate and acquire land for the project and the estimated cost. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the petition filed by Gera Developments Private Limited and interim applications filed by various persons on Tuesday, was informed by senior advocate Virag Tulzapurkar for Gera Developments that the petitioner was aggrieved by PMRDA order restraining MIDC from issuing the OC and CC for a multi-storey commercial building constructed by the petitioners on a leasehold plot of land belonging to MIDC. The proposed 128-km ring road around Pune was first conceived in 1994 by PMRDA and was to service 29 villages by connecting highways around the city and regulate pollution levels in the city by diverting heavy vehicular traffic from entering the city to reduce existing traffic congestion. The 120-metre-wide road is proposed to be constructed at a cost of ₹26,831 crore and will have 14 multilevel interchanges and eight major bridges to facilitate smooth traffic. The circular road is set to have 18 viaducts, 17 tunnels and four roadways over bridges. In a previous hearing, Tulzapurkar had informed the bench that the issuance of certificates was withheld on the grounds that, in pursuance of a development plan conceived in 1997, a ring road measuring 120m in width was proposed to be constructed which would cut across the plot of land on which the building was constructed. Tulzapurkar had submitted that his client had started construction of the building after receiving requisite permissions from MIDC in 2016 and the building was completed and commercial units in the building had also been sold, but possession was not granted to the buyers for want of the certificates. He said if the certificates were not granted, his client would become embroiled in proceedings which would be initiated by the buyers before MahaRERA, and hence sought directions to PMRDA to withdraw its restraining order to MIDC. On its part, Shyamali Gadre, counsel for MIDC, said it was bound by PMRDA orders and could not do much till the development authority issued an order to issue the certificates. Gadre, however, added that MIDC had written to the urban development department in November 2020, requesting them to grant approval to the building, failing which the government would suffer huge revenue losses. On the query of the court as to why PMRDA was sleeping while construction of the building started and woke up only when the issuance of the OC and CC came up, advocate Nitin Deshpande for PMRDA submitted that the authority was willing to sit with MIDC and petitioners and find a solution by reducing the width of the ring road from 120 metres by 45-60 metres and also by changing the alignment of the proposed ring road. Deshpande added that a proposal to that effect has been forwarded to the urban development department and a response was awaited. However, additional government pleader Manish Pabale refuted PMRDA’s claim and said that no such proposal was pending before the department. He submitted that the ring road was vital for the growth of Pune and would also reduce congestion, and hence there could be no compromise. After hearing all sides, the bench asked the state whether the plan conceived in 1994 was feasible today and if yes, the state should file an affidavit elaborating on the rough estimate of the total project cost and approximate time for construction, excluding the time to be taken for acquiring lands to be affected by the project. The state has also been asked to state the likely time to be taken for demarcation and acquisition of lands by August 18. The court has posted hearing of the petition to August 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/is-1994-pune-ring-road-plan-still-feasible-bombay-hc-asks-state-101628700631367.html

11-08-2021||Other||Confusion prevails over reopening of schools from August 17||PUNE Parents and teachers are confused about State government order on reopening of schools for Class 8 to Class 12 from August 17. On Wednesday, health minister Rajesh Tope said that chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray would discuss the reopening of schools with the task force, education department and health department. “Maharashtra Covid-19 task force has unanimously expressed a fear about reopening of schools as all students are below 18 years of age and are not vaccinated. The CM will meet and discuss with v the education department about the same on Wednesday evening,” said Tope. However, on Tuesday, the state government issued an order directing local governing bodies to take a call on reopening of schools if urban areas have been Covid free for over a month.After schools reopened in rural areas on July 15, one school in Bhor taluka of Pune district reported cases of positive students.Harishchandra Gaikwad, president of the Pune district principals’ association, said that confusion is prevailing regarding the decision to reopen schools.“The state government has given the respective district collectors the authority to decide on whether to reopen schools or not. However, on August 8, the order issued by the district collector clearly states that schools in the district will remain shut. The recent decision by the government is creating a lot of confusion,” said Gaikwad.He further added that even though students are not attending offline classes, teachers are regularly going to the schools.“Around 90 per cent of teachers in the district have taken the vaccine against Covid-19,” noted Gaikwad.In an interview on Wednesday, minister of state for education, Bacchu Kadu said that he is not in favour of only a few schools reopening now. “We can wait for two more months and then start all schools at once. I am not in the favour of reopening only a few schools now,” Kadu said.Sharing the confusion around the opening of schools, Pragati Kulkarni, mother of a Class 11 student said that there is a lot of confusion regarding the reopening of schools.“Children are eagerly waiting for offline classes, but due to the pandemic, there is confusion if schools will reopen or not and for how long. With the threat of a third wave, I feel it will be very unsafe for children to attend offline classes as they are not vaccinated. Moreover, students may not really follow social distancing once they are in school,” said Kulkarni.Dnyaneshwar Molak, additional commissioner of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said that the decision to reopen schools will be taken based on the directives of the state government.“A committee will be formed headed by the PMC chief and then the subsequent decision will be taken. As of now, there is no concrete decision whether schools will be reopened from August 17 or not. In the next few days, a meeting will be organised and the committee will decide,” said Molak.Sunanda Wakhare, secondary school officer, Zilla Parishad, said that schools in the rural parts are being monitored each day.“After reopening of schools in rural areas of Pune district, only one school was shut down after Covid positive cases were detected. As of now, 130 schools are running in the district. However, the school in Bhor taluka where positive patients were found is still shut. The decision on whether to reopen schools from August 17 or not will be taken on August 13,” added Wakhare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/confusion-prevails-over-reopening-of-schools-from-august-17-101628700270534.html

Earlier, HCMTR became controversial as the tenders were high. Before Fadnavis, Pune district guardian minister Ajit Pawar also took a decision to execute the neo metro, with the HCMTR a green corridor and no private vehicles on it.Fadnavis is in favour of introducing one more line for private vehicles.Maha-metro officials speaking anonymously said that there is a primary discussion for preparing a DPR, but the PMC has not given any official letter yet.“Neo metro was invented by Maha-metro. It has been accepted in seven cities in the country. We would definitely like to execute it in Pune,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-to-ask-maha-metro-to-create-project-report-for-hcmtr-101628699970399.html

As per public health department data, Kolhapur district recorded a 3.1% positivity rate same as the state average for the week from August 2 to August 8. Satara however continued to record the highest combined positivity rate and RTPCR positivity rate in the state at 6.7% and 6.8%, respectively.Dr Pradip Awate, state surveillance officer, said, “The testing rate in Kolhapur is good. It has reflected in the positivity rate of the district which has reduced to match the state average. Sangli and Satara are still recording positivity rates of above 6%.”The Kolhapur district administration has undertaken a massive drive for door-to-door sample collection for RTPCR tests. Between August 2 and August 8, a total 121,347 samples were collected in Kolhapur district out of which 3,795 tested positive. Of the total number of tests, 109,680 were RTPCR tests through which 3,025 covid-19 cases were detected.Rahul Rekhawar, collector, Kolhapur, said, “By mid-July this year, the positivity rate of Kolhapur was around 13 to 14%. We started this targeted testing in villages where the number of active cases was high or on the rise. It helped us identify hidden cases and has shown positive results now. When we started the drive, there were 368 villages in the district with more than five active cases. Now, this number has plummeted to less than 170. The number of active patients now is only 40% of what it was on July 15. When we planned this drive, we made sure that there was no scarcity of testing kits. After constant follow-ups, laboratories in Mumbai are giving us results in 48 hours.”Dr Anil Mali, civil surgeon, Kolhapur district, said, “As RTPCR tests are most reliable, we are emphasising on doing the maximum number of RTPCR tests. In the Kolhapur district, almost 90% of the total tests are RTPCR tests. Currently, we are doing house-to-house RTPCR tests in the district. We are identifying villages that have more than five active cases and the drive is extended to such villages. The head of the family is tested on priority basis as they are likely to go out more often and come in contact with other people. So, it is more likely that they would test positive. This massive drive is being conducted for the past two weeks. Every day, we get up to 15,000 reports of RTPCR tests.”“We will continue this drive in the future as well. It has helped to identify asymptomatic cases. If such cases are identified and isolated at the right time, the likely spread of infection in the community can be prevented. There is a government lab for RTPCR testing in Kolhapur where 3,500 to 4,000 people are tested on a daily basis. Other samples are sent to other government-approved labs,” Dr Mali said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kolhapur-positivity-rate-drops-to-3-1-due-to-aggressive-testing-drive-101628699910435.html

One team consists of a doctor, two nurses, a health care worker, a crowd control manager and a data entry operator. These campaigns were held in schools, community halls and at workplaces.“After government offices, we began with vulnerable groups like homes for seniors and homes for disabled children. Then super spreaders like shop associations and traders as well. We also vaccinated daily wage workers as well as hawkers. Transgenders had a special camp and although we faced resistance from sex workers, we got them vaccinated too,” said Vikram Kumar.The campaign continues in the slums and also covers maids and students travelling abroad.The second dose of vaccination began last week in the offices of the Income Tax department.“We plan to increase the teams from 14 to 20 to cover the city better and faster,” added Vikram Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmcs-vax-on-wheels-campaign-ensures-over-0-1-million-get-the-jab-101628699612311.html

I wish it remains the same in the future,” commented Subedar Kashinath Naik. Naik won a bronze at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in the javelin throw. Under Naik, Chopra was trained at the early stage of his career at Patiala in Punjab. Chopra was enrolled as a Junior Commissioned Officer, at the rank of Naib Subedar, in the Indian Army on August 26, 2016. He was awarded the Arjuna Award in 2018 and the Vishisht Seva Medal in 2021 for his meritorious service. “Since 2015 we are observing him and he is very mature when it comes to handling the sports. During his junior days, he never feared to compete with senior players. This confidence was one of the main reasons he won gold in the Tokyo Olympics,” said Naik. In February 2021, Chopra had visited the Army Sports Institute (ASI). He was helped by the coaches and ASI officials to sort out the issue of passport before heading for training to Sweden. Thereafter, Chopra took a string of international training tours before heading to the Olympics “On February 6, when he visited Pune, Neeraj looked fit and he was hungry for medals. He spent some time with other Army officials and also visited my home. He is very humble and polite, which makes him a great sports person,” added Naik. Naik assisted Australian coach, the late Gary Calvert, when Chopra won gold with a junior world record at the U-20 World Championships in Poland, 2016. Sindhu at peace with her semi-final matchPV Sindhu, who won a bronze medal at the recently concluded Tokyo Olympics, is used to pressure. Her ability to stay motivated won her the medal after going down in the semi-finals. “After the semi-final, I was really sad and it was a mixed feeling as I lost the opportunity to compete in the final and I have to prepare for the bronze medal match in a day’s time. My parents motivated me and my coach Park Tae Sang told me about how much I have worked for the last five years and finishing fourth or on the podium is two different things,” said Sindhu in the city on Wednesday. Sindhu felt the momentum in the semi-final shifted after the shuttle hitting the net cord at 18-18 in the first game and things could have been different if she had won the first set. “I was playing well and was ahead in the first set. I really could not change what had happened but yeah… such things happen and we need to move ahead,” she said. Tokyo was a completely different experience for Sindhu than the Rio games, as she went as an underdog in 2016 while in 2021 she was expected to win a medal. “It was a very different experience altogether, as people were saying we want a medal again. I took it in a positive way and gave my best on the courts,” said Sindhu. The ace shuttler is happy that many sponsors (private and government) are coming forward to support athletes from a young age. “Now things have changed, many corporate are coming forward to sponsor budding athletes. Even the government has launched various schemes which are benefitting the athletes. Sponsors in sports play an important role in the support system,” Sindhu said. Sindhu is getting ready to achieve new heights and new dreams after the Tokyo Olympics. Pune connection PV Sindhu fondly remembers her visit to the city when she was 16 to take part in Sushant Chipalkatti memorial badminton tournament at the Modern Sports Complex. “Having lot of tournaments at age group, state and national, benefits players and it should keep happening as players grow by participating in more tournaments,” said Sindhu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/coach-remembers-how-a-humble-mature-junior-went-on-to-win-an-olympic-gold-101628699190409.html

Both were wanted by police of Rajasthan, Punjab, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh for their involvement in many heinous crimes, including robbery of 25 kg gold in Churu (Rajasthan) and another robbery in Amritsar (Punjab). Police recovered 300 gms gold looted during the robbery in Amritsar, two pistols and a motorcycle from them. SP (city), Bijnor Dr Praveen Ranjan said that Ranjeet alias Commando and his aide Amjad of Muzaffarnagar sustained injuries during exchange of fire and were admitted to hospital. He said that a constable Badal Dhaka also sustained bullet injury in his shoulder. Dr Ranjan said that both accused had over a dozen cases of loot, robbery and other crimes against them and they were also involved in the robbery in Mannapuram Finance Company in Churu. They looted 25 kg gold and ₹8 lakh cash from there on June 14. Earlier, on March 21, they robbed a house in Amritsar, decamping with 300 grams gold and cash. The SP said that Ranjeet and his gang members were unaware that the bag of gold looted from Manappuram Finance Company had chips and Rajasthan police started tracking them through GPS, recently arresting two gang members Shadab ( Muzaffarnagar) and Haneesh Thakur ( Mohali) in Hisar (Haryana). Ranjeet and Amjad managed to escape and went into hiding in Haridwar in Uttarakhand. The SP said Amjad used to visit his in-laws’ house in Bijnor and he tipped the gang about availability of gold in the office of Muthut Fincorp. The gang did a recce of the office on July 18 and the next day Ranjeet went there to commit a loot but a vendor Hoshram present in the office caught hold of him and Ranjeet opened fire. Ranjeet escaped from there and later Hoshram succumbed to his injuries. The official said that police parties were behind the gang since then. He said a joint team of city Kotwali and SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics), which was on checking on Mandawar Road on Tuesday night, stopped two motorcycle-borne people near Malan river and they opened fire on the police. When chased, they left the bike on the road and entered into the roadside sugarcane fields. In exchange of fire, both criminals sustained bullet injuries and were arrested. Dr Ranjan said that Ranjeet was a commando and was fired in 2010 for his alleged involvement in criminal activities. A resident of Patiala in Punjab, he gradually entered into the world of crime and formed his gang, targeting companies and traders who dealt in gold. The gang committed crimes in Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Moradabad, Hapur, Saharanpur, Bijnor, Punjab, Delhi and Rajasthan and was wanted by police of these states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/wanted-criminal-aide-held-in-uttar-pradeshafter-encounter-101628698411277.html

Dismissing a PIL filed by lawyer Gopal Krishna Pandey, a division bench comprising acting chief justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and justice Subhash Chandra Sharma observed, “Finding the subject matter as a policy of the state we are not inclined to allow online sale of liquor.” The counsel for the petitioner submitted that certain states have issued notification to allow online sale of liquor. It was in pursuance of the observations made by Supreme Court to the states to consider non-direct sale, including online/home delivery of liquor, to avoid over-crowding and to maintain social distancing norms in view of Covid-19. It was submitted that Madras High Court had permitted online sale of liquor.The chief standing counsel representing the state government opposed the petition and submitted that the prayer made was in reference to the policy decision and presently government was not inclined to allow online sale of liquor. The permission to sell liquor online by a few states was at the time when pandemic was at its peak to avoid over-crowding at shops.In the PIL, several reasons were cited like allowing online sale of liquor would mean more sale and revenue. Besides, there will be low cost of maintenance of shops. Rejecting the plea the court said, “Petitioner has shown its concern to increase the revenue of the state and other aspects which include purchase of liquor even by those who may be shy in making purchases from the shop. The reasons given are not to avoid overcrowding or to maintain social distancing to follow the Covid-19 protocol rather it is for different reasons than observed by the apex court.”The court delivered this decision on August 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-dismisses-pil-seeking-online-sale-home-delivery-of-liquor-in-up-101628698172090.html

The deceased was identified as Arjun Dayal, a resident of Chitwan district in Nepal. He joined Gorkha battalion of BMP-1 in 2007, and was deputed near Thave temple since March this year. He was to leave for Bettiah on Wednesday after his transfer, officials said.

11-08-2021||Patna||Vikramshila varsity: Six years on, project still a non-starter||Ahead of the 2015 assembly elections, one of the important components of the ₹1,25,000-crore special package for Bihar announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi was to set up a central university near the ancient seat of learning at Vikramshila in Bhagalpur district. Six years on, even the land for the proposed university is not there. Bihar’s glorious history in the sphere of education is marked by two great institutions — ancient universities of Nalanda and Vikramshila – which flourished before the establishment of Oxford and Cambridge universities in the United Kingdom. Though the revival of Nalanda university has seen progress and the campus is being developed close to the ancient site, the remains of Vikramshila located near Antichak village in the Kahalgaon subdivision of Bhagalpur remain neglected for decades. The state just has to provide land for the central university, while the entire responsibility of infrastructure development and academic activities rests with the Centre. Bihar already has two central universities – Central University of South Bihar (CUSB) in Gaya and Mahatma Gandhi Central University in Motihari. While Centre arranged land for CUSB from the defence ministry and the campus is now buzzing, the Motihari Central University is still awaiting its campus over five years after its inception and is functioning from a makeshift campus. The Vikramshila issue was also raised in the Bihar Legislative Assembly in 2017 itself through a call attention motion by former Speaker and senior Congress leader Sadanand Singh and the Bihar government made a statement that the Bhagalpur district magistrate had been asked to identify three different plots of land so that the Central team could visit for site selection. However, a central panel could visit the site for the proposed Vikramshila Central University only this year, in March, and has submitted its interim report. The team was headed by the then CUSB vice-chancellor HCS Rathore and also comprised Central Public works Department (CPWD) and representatives of the Bihar government. “We have given a positive interim report pertaining to suitability of land shown to us to the ministry of human resource development. The 282-acre plot identified by the Bihar government should be sufficient, but land acquisition has to be completed. It is four kilometres from the ancient site. Now the decision has to be taken at the higher level,” Rathore said. Bhagalpur district magistrate Subrat Kumar Sen said the report regarding the land in the Kahalgaon circle has been sent to the ministry by the committee. “Once the ministry gives its nod and we get the money for acquisition, we will start the process,” he said. On November 20, 2015, the HRD ministry had requested the state government to provide two or three locations of 500 acres land, of which one suitable site (free or cost and free from all encumbrances) would be selected for the proposed university. However, the state government proposed to reduce the land area requirement to 200 acres, stating that most of the land in the state is agricultural and there is shortage of land area. Accordingly, it was decided that the state government may provide 200 acres to begin with and acquire another 300 acres for further expansion. Later, in 2018, three sites at Parshuramchak, Antichak and Kisandaspur were identified.Ancient universities of Nalanda and Vikramshila flourished before the establishment of Oxford and Cambridge universities in the United Kingdom. Remains of Vikramshila are located near Antichak village in Bhagalpur.Ahead of 2015 Bihar polls, PM Modi announced ₹1,25,000-crore special package for the state, of which setting up a central university near Vikramshila ruins in Bhagalpur’s Kahalgaon was a key component.On Nov 20, 2015, HRD ministry requested Bihar government to provide two or three locations of 500 acres, of which one site would be selected. State govt proposed to reduce the land requirement to 200 acres, citing shortage.In 2018, three sites at Parshuramchak, Antichak and Kisandaspur were identified. In March this year, a central team visited the 282-acre plot situated four kilometres from the ancient site of Vikramshila university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/vikramshila-varsity-six-years-on-project-still-a-nonstarter-101628697990887.html
11-08-2021||Patna||Patna breathed only seven ‘good’ air quality days in last 7 months: Report||The capital city experienced only seven days of good quality ambient air, as categorised by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), in the past seven months this year.It was revealed in a report called Ambient Air Quality Assessment of Patna, carried out by the Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED) — an independent organisation working for environment conservation — based on data of air quality released daily by the CPCB. The analysis indicates that only 3% of the total days (7 months) were in the ‘Good’ category and the air quality in the city was not healthy to breathe on the remaining 97% of the days, where 66% of the days were in ‘Moderate’ and ‘Very Poor’ air quality category while only 31% of days fell into ‘Satisfactory’ category. These findings are significant as the state had been under lockdowns during the last seven months due to the Covid pandemic when most of the economic and industrial activities were temporarily ceased.The pollution trends show that January was the most polluted month, while July happened to be the least polluted month in the same period based on the monthly mean concentration of PM2.5. The average concentration of PM2.5 was 130 µg/m3 in January, while in February and March, it was 114 µg/m3 and 98 µg/m3, respectively. The average concentration in April and May months was 89 µg/m3 & 39 µg/m3. In June, the monthly mean concentration was 33 µg/m3 and in July, it was 25 µg/m3.Ankita Jyoti, senior program officer at CEED, said, “The clean air action plan (CAAP) -- notified by the Bihar state pollution control board (BSPCB) two years ago for Patna -- is an important response to curb air pollution. About half of the steps should have been implemented as per the mandates.” “The state government agencies must take formidable measures such as ensuring effective accountability mechanism to meet the air quality goals, facilitating a single-window access system to track measures undertaken, enhancing public access to the quarterly progress report of the plan submitted to the NGT and ensuring adequate representation of civil society organisations in the monitoring committee, besides holding effective public awareness programs in the city,” said CEED senior program officer.A comparative analysis of PM2.5 was also done for 2020 (Jan-July), which indicated that the PM2.5 was 25% higher in February, 31% in March and 50% in April this year. The average monthly concentration of PM2.5 is 15% higher in May as compared to last year, a total of 27% higher concentration was observed in June this year, while in July, it was only 5% higher.The statistics of the last five years indicated that air pollution in Patna is in critical condition and has shown an increasing trend since 2016 and citizens are forced to breathe in unhealthy air. For Instance, the annual concentration of PM10 was at least 3.5 times the national standard in 2016, 3.4 times in 2018 and 3.9 times in 2019. Though in 2017, the level of pollution decreased slightly, still it was 2.6 times more than the national standard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/patna-breathed-only-seven-good-air-quality-days-in-last-7-months-report-101628697691065.html

Courts in Jharkhand are currently functioning largely in virtual mode owing to Covid-19 restrictions.The case, which involves fraudulent withdrawal of ₹139.35 crore from Ranchi’s Doranda treasury in 1995-96, is the biggest among the fodder scam cases as it involves maximum number of accused (170), highest amount of alleged defalcation and highest number of prosecution witnesses. Seventy of the accused, including former Bihar chief minister Jagarnath Mishra, died during the course of trial. Currently, 110 accused, including Prasad, are facing trial. After the prosecution completed its arguments in the case on August 7 in the case during a virtual hearing, lawyers of 89 of the 110 accused urged the court on August 9 to defer the hearings, citing difficulty in presenting “voluminous” documents virtually. The defence is to cross-examine witnesses next. Rejecting the petition, the court directed the defence to begin their final arguments from August 13, said CBI counsel BMP Singh. However, the court has directed that a limited number of lawyers can show the documents in physical form while following Covid-19 guidelines. Besides, a maximum of five lawyers can also argue in person, Singh said.Prasad’s counsel Prabhat Kumar said they will decide on the future course of action after getting a copy of the order. The RJD chief is currently out on bail after spending more than three years in jail following his conviction in three separate fodder scam cases in quick succession.

These meets are essentially the party’s farmer outreach initiatives which would include ‘Kisan Samvad’ (dialogue with farmers) from August 16 to 23 and ‘Kisan Sansad’ (parliament of farmers) from August 22 to 25. In western UP, home to BKU, the BJP has planned ‘Kisan Chaupal’ (farmers’ gathering). Top ministers and BJP functionaries would participate in these farmer outreach programmes, BJP leaders said. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath too would be part of these initiatives, BJP leaders said. Various ministers of the Adityanath government would be part of these dialogues with farmers, BJP leaders indicated. The BJP’s farmer wing would organize these activities which were chalked out after BJP chief JP Nadda’s two-day UP visit, party leaders said. The party leaders would talk about the various initiatives undertaken by the BJP government at the centre and in UP for the farmers, party leaders said. At a recent meeting of the farmers’ wing, the BJP chief Swatantra Dev had described the ongoing agitation against the farm laws as a conspiracy fuelled by opposition. “BKU chief Mahendra Singh Tikait is unrelenting in his opposition against the farm laws. The BKU stir has been backed by several opposition parties, so the party would now directly interact with the farmers and explain the BJP line and various initiatives that had been taken for the farmers,” a BJP leader said. “Of the 403 assembly segments, about 299 have full or partial rural character. Hence we plan to cover as many assembly segments as we can, telling farmers what the three farm laws are all about and freely talk to them about their fears and dispel doubts,” a BJP leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-to-embark-on-farmer-outreach-programme-101628697271169.html

11-08-2021||Pune||Pune court rejects bail application of arrested Amravati town planning joint director||Pune: Additional sessions judge SB Hedao has rejected the bail application of suspended Amravati town planning joint director Hanumant Nazirkar in the disproportionate assets case. Nazirkar and his family, including nephew Rahul Shivaji Khomane (31) of Shirwal in Baramati, stand accused of accumulating properties worth ₹82.38 crore in violation of the law. Along with Nazirkar, six other people, including his wife, daughter, son, nephew, and their lawyer have also been booked. Nazirkar’s bail was rejected by a special court in Pune in May. Nazirkar and Khomane were arrested in March in a case by the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) registered at Alankar police station in June 2020. The eight family members booked in the case have been accused of illegally amassing assets worth ₹82,38,34,941, according to the police complaint in the case. The prosecution stated that the police investigation into the corruption case involving Nazirkar and his family has found that they have illegal property worth ₹82.38 crores besides 37 companies wherein they are the majority shareholders. Nazirkar had kept his illegal properties as collateral with a bank and Khomane had obtained a loan of ₹48 lakh of the said collateral pledged by the main accused. Later, he invested the said amount in one of the shell companies floated by his family members. Khomane had forged memorandums of understanding and 35 such bogus documents have been seized by the investigators, the prosecution stated. The investigators informed the court that they had to recover 346 agricultural receipts from Khomane and probe transactions of ₹87 lakh which took place in the personal account. They submitted that an investment of ₹23 lakh in Gitanjali realty company was to be probed further. Regarding Nazirkar, the prosecution said that his father-in-law had 37 properties in his name, while 17 properties were in Nazirkar and his wife’s name. Following his father-in-law’s death, a forged power of attorney was readied and all the companies, including properties, were transferred in the name of his wife Sangeeta Nazirkar, said public prosecutor Rajesh Kavediya. Nazirkar has three other cases registered against him - two in Baramati police station of Pune rural and one at APMC police station of Navi Mumbai. The police have been investigating the allegations against the Nazirkar family between January 1986 and March 2020 when he served in public office. The case was lodged under Sections 13(m)(b)(e), RW 13(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act, and Sections 109, 420, 465, 467, 468, 471, 472, 474, 475, and 120(b) of Indian Penal Code at Alankar police on June 23, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-court-rejects-bail-application-of-arrested-amravati-town-planning-joint-director-101628695410101.html

The Delhi government can send the data by August 13, Mandaviya said attaching a screenshot of the mail sent by the ministry.“Respected Sisodia Ji, Here is the copy of the mail sent by my ministry to the Delhi government on 26th July. It's not too late yet! By August 13 you can send the data so that we can answer the question to Parliament. After reviewing with your officers, please send the necessary data as soon as possible,” Mandaviya tweeted on Wednesday.On Tuesday, in an online press conference, Manish Sisodia alleged that the Central government had not asked for data on deaths caused by a shortage of oxygen. “I read in the paper that the Central government is saying it has asked state governments to furnish details on deaths due to lack of oxygen. News reports have also said that 13 states have responded and only 1 state has done so while 12 states have not. I also read in the papers that the Central government has given states till August 13 to tell them if oxygen-related deaths have happened. Ever since I read this in the papers, I have been asking administrators if any letter has come from the Centre, and till today no such letter has come. Delhi government has received no such letter from the Central government,” Sisodia said during an online briefing.Also Read: Covid-19 in Delhi: Manish Sisodia calls for thorough probe into oxygen deaths“We accept that the oxygen crisis happened during the last wave of the pandemic. And without any probe, it is difficult to say if that has caused deaths. I am going deeper into whether it has or has not. I am stressing on the importance of thorough investigation into cases of deaths that can be related to oxygen shortage,” he added.The Union health ministry on Tuesday said 13 states and UTs of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Odisha, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab have responded to the query on oxygen deaths, with Punjab reporting “four suspected deaths” due to oxygen shortage. "When the question was raised in Parliament, states were specifically asked this question and as per reports received only one state mentioned suspected death and no state has so far said that there were deaths because of oxygen shortage," joint secretary Lav Agarwal said.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) led Delhi government has been involved in a tussle with the Centre on the matter of deaths due to oxygen shortage in the national capital. On May 4, Delhi government told Delhi high court that an expert committee could not ascertain whether 21 deaths at the capital’s Jaipur Golden Hospital took place because of oxygen shortage. Delhi health minister Satyandar Jain defended the findings by reasoning that it was based on “preliminary investigation” and that the matter needed more thorough investigation. The AAP government also hit out at the Centre for not letting it set up a larger expert committee to probe the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/not-too-late-health-minister-on-manish-sisodia-s-claim-regarding-oxygen-related-coviddeaths-101628694800685.html

11-08-2021||Mumbai||Vaccine inequity: Two-dose mandate for train travel will force people to get paid jabs||The mandate of being fully vaccinated to travel in Mumbai local trains has put a spotlight on the inequitable distribution of doses in Mumbai and rest of Maharashtra. Many commuters, who are in need to travel in local trains, will be denied access as they are still waiting to get the jabs. With limited doses available in the public sector, this mandate will also push people to get paid doses at private hospitals. “On one hand, the government has restricted travel to fully-vaccinated people and on the other hand, people willing to get vaccinated are struggling to find doses,” said Bhayander resident Shailesh Goyal, a member of the Zonal Rail Users Consultative Committee. “The shortage of vaccines in the public sector is unfair to lakhs of commuters who will be denied access. In a way, the government is forcing them to get vaccinated from private sector,” he said. Maharashtra has been reeling under a severe shortage of Covid-19 vaccines. Shortages have been recorded on multiple occasions since the nationwide vaccination drive began on January 16. For instance, last month, public sector vaccination drives in Mumbai were cancelled on five days due to shortage of doses, in addition to four Sundays when public vaccination drive remains officially closed. The private sector, on the other hand, has an estimated stock of around 1 million doses. This month, Mumbai civic body had to hold vaccination drives only at limited centres on three occasions due to severe shortage of doses. The last batch of 45,000 doses was received by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Saturday and most centres were waiting to open their slots on Wednesday hoping to receive some doses. Mumbai has administered over 7.6 million doses to date. Around 9 million people aged above 18 years are eligible to get Covid-19 vaccine, but only 1.9 million or 21% have been fully vaccinated as of Wednesday. Only around 140,000 people in the 18 to 44 age group are fully vaccinated. “The 18-44 age group largely consists of the working, mobile population. Due to the vaccine shortfall, many of them will not be able to access local trains,” said Goyal, adding that the Central government should have distributed enough vaccines to states like Maharashtra where cities have a lot of dependence on public transport. Epidemiologist and health systems expert Dr Chandrakant Lahariya said the two-dose mandate for local trains is very restrictive, considering the fact that only a small percentage of the population is fully vaccinated. “The government can consider allowing those who have had the Covid-19 infection. Also, people who have taken one shot can be considered for local train travel, as it means they are committed to taking the second dose,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaccine-inequity-two-dose-mandate-for-train-travel-will-force-people-to-get-paid-jabs-101628690250468.html

However, police dismissed the "misinformation", saying the exact cause will be known after autopsy.The ASI, identified as Ajay Kushwah, was posted in the Hira Nagar police station in the city. Police officials said Kushwah went to sleep in his home last night. When his family members tried to wake him up on Tuesday morning, he did not respond. Later, doctors declared him dead. Some social media reports claimed that Kushwah was an alcoholic and might have died after consuming spurious liquor. "Kushwah probably died of a heart attack. Misinformation was spread that he died after drinking spurious liquor," police said, adding that postmortem is being performed on Kushwah's body to identify the exact cause of the death. At least five people died in the last 20 days in Indore after drinking liquor laced with methyl alcohol, according to police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/indore-news/indore-cop-s-sudden-death-leads-to-social-media-speculation-on-probable-cause-101628685870509.html

11-08-2021||Chandigarh||On the learning curve in life’s eternal classroom||While the fear of gadgets is not uncommon among the children of the sixties/seventies in general, those of us in the pedagogy were singled out by the thunderbolt from the pandemic blues. We woke up on March 23, 2020, to abruptly assume the novel charge of online teachers. A tectonic shift from physical to virtual classrooms happened in a jiffy. PPTs, term-end presentations, assessments, evaluations, statistical data, PDFs, charts and Excel sheets were flung at us even before we rubbed our eyes open. It was assumed that we were all tech wizards who had been keeping our digital skills under wraps all this while. Oh my, who do we turn to now? Who would defuse the bombshell that had landed in the college campuses? The millennials in our lives, of course. In course of the bumpy ride from seminar to webinar, most of us had epic moments we can now look back at with a smile. The first gauntlet landed in the form of an invite to be a resource person for a week-long online workshop for research scholars, and I lifted it little envisaging the details of the drill that would ensue. The talks were to be forwarded to the coordinator as segments of audio-video recordings. Honestly, the delight of the talks was sucked out by the anxiety typical of a digibeet. My daughter, who had taken to work from home like duck to water, was in guffaws of laughter at my awkwardness. For me, the bizarre demand of talking into a static black screen was not only ruffling but also eerily post-human. We can look back at the bygone year with pride; the task of packaging lessons in totality for online platforms was daunting. Our homes changed into mini theatres and the natural animated spontaneity of the classroom was reworked into measured bytes of information. As the buzz of Webex, Zoom and Google Meet swept across, my comrades went into a virtual overdrive to keep the ship of education sailing. Our lot had not signed up for this! ‘Once a teacher, always a learner’ applied to the world of concepts not algorithms. Thankfully, our tech-savvy angels at home and our students in class held our hand and led us through the digi-tunnel we thought we had escaped. Wordsworth’s epigram, The child is the father of man, spun into play, not in the context of human nature, but that of the Almighty computer. Was there a generation in history that remained eternally schooled? That took directions from parents, and now constantly seeks instructions from children? Or to put it bluntly, were ‘beamers’ for their parents and are ‘boomers’ for the progeny? Yes, those who slogged their way up the academic ladder only to begin afresh in the kindergarten of technology in dire circumstances. Ironically, while the elders at home refused to understand what more was there to frantically learn, the youngsters with nimble fingers were surprised by how little we knew. manindersidhu7@gmail.com The writer heads the English department at Government College for Girls, Chandigarh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/on-the-learning-curve-in-life-s-eternal-classroom-101628682750387.html

11-08-2021||Chandigarh||Power regulator allows PSPCL to end pact with 3 NTPC plants||In its first move to allow Punjab State Power Corporation Limited to terminate an agreement with producers having higher generation cost, the state regulator has permitted PSPCL to relinquish allocated power from National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC). This will save ₹115 crore annually that the PSPCL was paying to NTPC generating stations at Anta, Auraiya and Dadri as fixed capacity charges without even drawing power. The PSPCL had signed the power purchase agreement (PPA) in 1997 for these plants and was getting 49MW from Anta, 83MW from Auraiya and 132MW from Dadri, all gas-based power plants of NTPC. Also read: Indian Air Force drone crashes in field in Punjab; probe initiated, says reportBarring Dadri, the other projects have completed the useful life of 25 years. The PPA with these plants had a two-part tariff: Fixed cost and variable cost. As the variable cost of power, which depends upon the prices of gas from these plants was higher, the PSPCL was not drawing power from them. The power from these plants cost between ₹8 and ₹14 a unit, depending upon the cost of gas prices. Higher cost of power purchase Due to additional 3,920MW from independent power producers (IPPs) since 2013-14 and electricity from external sources under long-term PPAs, Punjab had surplus power. Since the PSPCL was not scheduling its allocated share from the gas-based stations, Punjab urged the Union power ministry to reallocate its share to other states. The PSPCL surrendered more than 90% of its share in 2018-19 and 88% in 2019-20 but is still paying fixed charges to Anta, Auraiya and Dadri power stations. The PSPCL paid ₹128.99 crore in 2018-19 and ₹115.11 crore in 2019-20 as fixed charges against power surrendered from these gas-based power plants. It said that continued allocation of power from the generating stations is a financial burden and is leading to higher cost of power purchase that is passed on to consumers and translates in tariff hike. NTPC opposes move to cancel PPA The PSPCL sought permission to relinquish its allocated share from the three stations of NTPC, which opposed the move. The NTPC contended that the PSPCL is power surplus, but according to projections it needs more power as it is going to be deficit in the peak season in 2023. Cancelling the PPA will lead to higher power cost in future for PSPCL, it said. The Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) said that it has noted PSPCL’s submission that the variable cost of Anta, Auraiya and Dadri gas power stations is among the highest. “The allocation of power from these generating stations, which have high variable costs, is causing undue financial burden on the PSPCL and is leading to higher cost of purchase of power which is against the interest of consumers in Punjab,” the PSERC said in its decision. Decision to benefit power consumers Citing provisions of the power ministry to review the PPA after useful life, the PSERC said since the ministry has allowed discoms to surrender entire power from a project, the PSPCL is allowed to relinquish power from these projects. PSPCL chairman A Venu Prasad said this is a welcome decision and it will save around ₹115 crore for the PSPCL, which will reduce power purchase cost and ultimately benefit consumers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/power-regulator-allows-pspcl-to-end-pact-with-3-ntpc-plants-101628681730179.html
11-08-2021||Pune||Sutradhara’s Tales: Nanasaheb Peshwa kick-starts Pune’s development with the Parvati temple complex||1740 served a big blow to the Maratha empire and Peshwa rule over Pune, as Peshwa Bajirao I passed away at Raver Khedi during the Malwa campaign. The passing of the legendary commander and prime minister of the Maratha Empire, who never lost a battle and contributed greatly to the expansion of Maratha territory, left a power vacuum. His able brother and second-in-command Chimaji Appa, too, passed away within a few months after falling ill. Balaji Bajirao alias Nanasaheb, born on December 12, 1721, was the eldest son of Bajirao I’s four sons and entered political administration at an early age at Chhatrapati Shahu’s Darbar. Nanasaheb had proven his prowess at diplomacy and administration, as he represented Bajirao at the darbar during Bajirao Peshwa’s military campaigns. He was ably mentored by Chimaji Appa, his uncle, from age of 15 as he frequented the Satara court. After the passing of Bajirao I, his mother, Kashibai and grandmother, Radhabai too, supported him in home and state affairs. At the age of 10, he was married to Gopikabai from the money-lender family of Rastes at Wai, on the recommendation of Chhatrapati Shahu.Over-ruling the opposition by the Bhosales of Nagpur, Chhatrapati Shahu who was fond of the young Nanasaheb and appointed him as Peshwa on June 25, 1740. Unlike his father Nanasaheb was more of a diplomat and strategist and did not take part in military campaigns of the Marathas. By the age of 19, Nanasaheb Peshwa was quick to establish his command over the administration which increasingly fell upon him due to the old age and ill health of Chhatrapati Shahu. While Nanasaheb was engaged in serving the Satara throne, he did not neglect the development of Pune. One of the most iconic developments during Nanasaheb’s times, which stands tall even today, is the Parvati temple complex on the hill.The village of Parvati existed from Shivaji Raje’s times. Archives provide us a reference of one Mahadbhat, son of Mudgal bhat from the family of Purandare, who were given inam of Parvati village. Even today, many residences of the Purandare family are seen in the vicinity. Due to the availability of flat land at the base and its nearness to the river, many Maratha sardars had their military base near Parvati hill. Before the Peshwas entered the scene, there existed a settlement named Jalakwadi at the base of the hill. Nawaloji Taware was a mother-caring son and was worried about his mother Sakharau’s chronic illness. No medicines helped her which left Navaloji worried. One night, a goddess came into his drams and told him that his mother’s illness will vanish if he serves the goddess with utmost devotion. Navloba searched the hill to finally come across an idol of the goddess Parvati. Nawaloji consecrated the idol and established in it a small shrine. His mother, Sakharau was cured by the goddess’ prasada and news spread far and wide. Thus, common folks started frequenting the hill temple of folk goddess, Parvati.This temple, coincidently, came to notice of Kashibai, Bajirao I’s wife which eventually led to expansion of the temple land establishment of the Parvati temple complex. The story goes that, Nanansaheb peshwa’s mother, Kashibai noticed the hill of Parvati, when she took up residence at a mansion near Mastani bagh, located at the foothill. She was intrigued by the crowds flocking to the hilltop and on enquiry, found out about the temple of Parvati and the devotee, Navaloji Taware Patil. She invited Navaloji Patil and expressed her wish to appeal to goddess Parvati to cure her ailing leg. She also vowed to construct a temple to the goddess if the leg was cured. The treatment of tirtha from the Goddess Parvati cured Kashibai’s ailing leg. Impressed with the spiritual power of the goddess, she appealed to Nanasaheb Peshwa to complete her vow of building a temple to the goddess. She also made sure that the income from the temple went to Navloji Patil.Nanasaheb Peshwa decided to establish a shrine on the hill in commemoration of the tutelary deity of the Peshwa family, Mahadev Shiva. Thus, the Panchayatana temple consisting of central idols of Mahadev Shiva, alongwith goddess Parvati, and Ganesha and separate shrines of Suryanarayana, Ganesha, Parvati and Lakshmi - Janardan Vishnu were erected. Thus, Shiva panchayatana consisting of the Peshwa clan’s five tutelary deities from Shrivardhan, Harihareshwar and Diveagar was established near Pune in 1749.Chhatrapati Shahu maharaj passed away in December 1749. Legend has it that as a gesture of reverence to Chhatrapati Shahu, Nanasaheb Peshwa brought his khadava (sacred clog) and Shivlinga used in his daily worship, to Pune. He established them under Mahadev Shivalaya on Parvati below the central shivlinga as a mark of respect. Nanasaheb Peshwa personally worshipped for a month after consecration, and continued thought out his life. He often made his residence at Parvati hill to continue the worship and sought solace from troubling political affairs. The temple started in the year 1747; the idols were ready by 1747 and construction of temple was completed in 1749.Idols of Ganesha and Parvati were made of gold; that of Shiva was made of silver with Parvati in gold, seated on his thigh. Ornaments were carved on sculptures and inset with various gem stones. Idols were adorned with new and colourful clothes, every day. Prasada was offered three times a day. All the nitya (daily) and naimaittik (occasional) rituals were performed in a strict manner. Temple activities of drum service, recitation of texts and mantras, devotional singing and charity for Brahmins were held on regular basis. The expense of the construction of the temple complex came to Rs39,977, and for rituals and feasts it was around Rs4,320. Khajagiwale, incharge of the personal affairs of the Peshwas were appointed to look after the management of the Parvati temple complex. The consecration of idols took place in April 1749 and the complex was named as “Devdeveshwar”. There is some debate about the exact date, but the anniversary of the establishment is celebrated on April 23 every year by the Devdeveshwar Sansthan trust, managing the Parvati complex today. The fame and prosperity of Devdeveshwar continued to grow. We shall look at the further history, events and the making of the Devdeveshwar complex on Parvati hill in the next column.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sutradharas-tales-nanasaheb-peshwa-kick-starts-pune-s-development-with-the-parvati-temple-complex-101628678971983.html

All major markets are expected to close by 8pm every day, thus making it impossible for mehendi artists to sit and work beyond that time. “People start coming in only by 7.30pm and by the time they sit to get their mehendi put, it will be close to 8pm. Is saal 30-40% business kum hoga humara because itni jaldi koi nai ayega. Also, it’s so hot during the day that no one is going to come before 6pm and by 7.30pm the market associations will start asking us to wrap up. It’s barely a few hours of business for us, and that will not be enough for festival days,” says Pitampura-based mehendi artist Kamal Marwadi. Booking home appointments, however, is something that’s providing a bit of relief to a few mehendi artists. “Jisne mehendi lagani hai, they will call us for sure. People are aware that it’s still not that safe to go to the markets. So, I’ve been getting a lot of calls from clients requesting me to come to their place and apply mehendi on their hands. I don’t take any appointments on the day of Teej, but did accept those requests that came a day or two in advance. Now, I’m totally booked,” says Shalimar Bagh-based mehendi artist Ritu Bagri, from Balaji Mehendi Art.Aastha Chandra, a Noida-based homemaker shares she too opted for a home appointment this Teej, and adds: “We always get mehendi applied on Teej. It’s so much fun when my mother-in-law and I go together to the nearby market. But, we used to go late evenings, eat something outside first, and then sit for our turn at the mehendiwala, by when it would be almost 10pm. But, this year that seems impossible. I don’t want to go to the market during the daytime because there will be so many people in the market, and honestly I’m still scared about Covid. So I’ve called a mehendi artist home. Utna fun toh nai hoga, but aur kya hi option hai.” Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/teej-2021-won-t-earn-much-as-markets-close-very-early-say-mehendiwalas-101628677667983.html

11-08-2021||Mumbai||No illegality in awarding Maharashtra Sadan construction contract: Court||There was no illegality in awarding the contract for construction of Maharashtra Sadan in New Delhi in the noughties, a special court has ruled while discharging five accused including directors of a construction firm. The court on July 31 said it also found no substance in the allegation that the firm, KS Chamankar Enterprises, allegedly paid ₹13.5 crore to family members of Maharashtra minister Chhagan Bhujbal. Bhujbal was then the Public Works Department (PWD) minister and his plea for discharge in the case is pending. He has insisted there is no evidence to prosecute him. The court held there was no direct or circumstantial evidence to show illegal means were adopted in awarding the contract. The detailed order of the court was made available on Tuesday.Also Read | Local trains to resume for fully vaccinated: Mumbai begins allotment of passesThe court discharged former superintending engineer Arun Deodhar, and Krishna Chamankar, Pravina Chamankar, Pranita Chamankar, Prasanna Chamankar, the directors of the firm.“The developers M/s K. S. Chamankar Enterprises cannot be held responsible as there was neither any illegal act nor while doing legal act, illegal means were adopted, which is a basic and essential requirement of the criminal conspiracy. Whether the amount of ₹13.5 crore received by accused No. 1 (Chhagan Bhujbal) and 12 to 17 (Bhujbal’s family members and close aides) was of corruption or undue advantage or not, is a question of fact, which can be determined on the basis of the relevant materials,” said the court.The court said the prosecution is uncertain whether the conspiracy started in 2001 or 2005. “There is no specific allegation as to on which day and stage the alleged conspiracy started. In absence of specific allegations, the details, and in absence of specific evidence to even infer such conspiracy of various officers at different level and at different places, it is difficult to hold even prima facie hatching a plan by the public servants to cause undue benefit to the developer in the project.”According to the prosecution, the redevelopment project commenced in 1998. From 2001 onwards, a proposal of KS Chamanakar Enterprises for the redevelopment was under consideration of the various departments including the PWD. “It is a matter of record that since 2001, the process of the project started, and it was completed in the year 2006-2007. In the period of 2001 to 2007, several officers might have changed or retired,” said the court.The state’s Anti-Corruption Bureau, in its charge sheet filed earlier this year, alleged the PWD, which was then headed by Bhujbal, conspired to ensure the firm benefits from the project. The charge sheet cited government norms and added a contractor should not earn a profit exceeding 20% for a project. It added in this case, the firm is alleged to have earned 81.9% profit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-illegality-in-awarding-maharashtra-sadan-construction-contract-court-101628671230017.html

The court, however, framed charges against AAP MLAs Prakash Jarwal and Amanatullah Khan under Sections 186, 353, and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Metropolitan Magistrate Sachin Gupta passed the order on Wednesday. A detailed order, however, is still awaited.In a press briefing today, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia referred to the court verdict and called the day one of victory "of justice and truth"."The court said that all allegations in the matter were false and baseless," Sisodia said while speaking to reporters. "The chief minister (Kejriwal) was acquitted today in that false case."Sisodia reiterated his claim that the case was just a 'conspiracy' to bring down Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. "We had been saying that the allegations were false," he said. "It was a conspiracy hatched against the chief minister."Anshu Prakash, then the chief secretary of Delhi, had alleged he was assaulted during a meeting at the chief minister's residence on February 19, 2018, following which a first information report (FIR) was lodged against Kejriwal, Sisodia, and 11 other AAP MLAs. Prakash had claimed that he was called for a midnight meeting to discuss the release of the party’s advertisements related to the government completing three years in Delhi, and manhandled and assaulted during the course of the meeting.The chief minister, the deputy chief minister, and the other AAP MLAs denied any wrongdoing in connection with the incident.

11-08-2021||Patna||Bihar govt faces flak for making teachers sell used bags of midday meal scheme||The Bihar government’s directive to teachers to sell gunny bags used to supply mid-day meals (MDM) in schools has met with criticism, and even led to a teacher’s suspension. Bihar Primary School Teachers Association (BPSTA) president Brajnandan Sharma cited the suspension of a Katihar-based teacher ”without any enquiry” and called it too stringent a measure. “Every individual’s level of understanding and his perspective on a particular issue is different. Teachers resent such directions,” he said, adding that MDM duties affect their work. However, he said he had no issue with the government seeking a report on gunny bag sales. In his letter dated July 22, to district programme officers, the director of MDM scheme in Bihar, issued instruction that proceeds from sale of empty gunny bags be maintained in a separate account, in a prescribed format, and a report be sent within a week’s time. The government has fixed ₹10 as the price for each gunny bag. This comes in the wake of an audit of records related to MDM scheme, conducted by Accountant General Office, which detected a loss to the state exchequer as no financial records pertaining to the sales had been maintained. The director of MDM scheme has issued instruction for sale reports in 2014-15 and 2015-16. Amitabh Kumar Das, a former IPS officer and the chairman of The Bihar Viplavi Parishad, has criticised the government order, saying it was against the dignity of teachers to sell used gunny bags. Das has written to principal secretary of education department to recall this order. In Katihar, the suspension of a contract teacher for a video showing him selling used gunny bags has taken another turn. The teacher, Md Tamijuddin posted at Primary School Kantadeeh, was suspended on August 8 and departmental proceedings initiated against him. He has now released another video in which he can be seen appealing to the chief minister to revoke his suspension order with a film song.He said, “After the order for selling used gunny bags was issued, I tried to sell them in school and when no takers turned up as the government has fixed price ₹10 for each bag, I decided to sell them in the market just to obey the order of the department.” He added, “Many of the bags were damaged by flood waters .”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-govt-faces-flak-for-making-teachers-sell-used-bags-of-midday-meal-scheme-101628664749126.html

11-08-2021||Mumbai||Local trains to resume for fully vaccinated: Mumbai begins allotment of passes||The process for verification of documents and allotment of railway passes for local trains begain in Mumbai today. This comes in the wake of the Maharashtra government’s decision to resume local train services for fully vaccinated commuters in the city from August 15. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) set up 358 helpdesks at 53 railway stations in its jurisdiction for the verification of vaccine status. People began gathering at the verification counters set up at Kalyan and Dombivli railway stations since 6am on Wednesday. While junctions such as Kurla, Dadar, and Bandra saw a larger number of people gather at counters, no crowding has been reported at any other station so far.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G/North ward, said, “Operations have been going on smoothly at helpdesks at Dadar. There is no crowd so far, as citizens have also realised there is time till August 15 to get the passes issued.”While some were clueless about the procedure and allotment of passes, some carried all their documents to be sure. “I have carried the vaccination certificate and my identification card. They are also asking for a photocopy of the ID card...nowhere had they mentioned that a photocopy will be required. After waiting in the queue for verification, we must wait for the passes in another queue,” said Mahajan Surve,40, as he waited at Kalyan railway station. Another applicant who did not wish to be named said, “I think the government should also allow those who have taken the first dose as it is a matter of their livelihood too.”The Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation has deployed a team of ward officers, deputy commissioner and others at the seven railway stations falling under its jurisdiction: Kalyan, Dombivli, Shahad, Ambivli, Kopar, Thakurli and Titwala stations. These teams are operating in two shifts of 7am-3pm and evening 3pm-11pm. The team first verifies the vaccination certificate of the applicant, scans the QR code on it and also verifies and collects a photocopy of the ID card. They then stamp the documents before sending the applicant to the railway counter to get the pass. “Today is the first day of verification. People are coming with soft copies of their documents which will not be considered. They should bring hard copies so that we can stamp them which will be further verified by the railway staffs for allotting the pass,” said Suhas Gupte ward officer, who is managing the counter at Dombivli station. Vasant Bhongade, ward officer at the Kalyan east counter said, “We have set up four counters and people have started coming for verification...There is a confusion related to documents as it is the first day. However, our team is guiding them.” Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in charge of BMC’s health department, who is overseeing these operations, conducted rounds of some railway stations in the city on Wednesday morning. Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar is also set to visit railway stations where helpdesks have been set up.A senior civic officer said, “Since fully vaccinated citizens also have to wait for 14 days after their second shot, before applying for passes, the sample size of fully vaccinated beneficiaries also opting for a train pass may be small. Among those fully vaccinated, those who want to take the train as well, may be a small number. We are yet to see how many passengers are opting for train travel.”According to data from BMC, a total of 1,914,771 beneficiaries have been fully vaccinated in Mumbai till date. Of these, 297,377 are healthcare and frontline workers; 646,939 are citizens above 60 years of age; 811,709 are citizens between 45 years and 59 years; 140,944 are citizens between 18 years and 44 years; 721 are lactating mothers; 8 are pregnant women; 16,889 are students or professionals looking to travel abroad, or those who were participating in Tokyo Olympics; 136 are physically or mentally differently abled beneficiaries; 26 are persons without identity proofs (prisoners/transgender persons); and 22 are bed-ridden beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/local-trains-to-resume-for-fully-vaccinated-mumbai-begins-allotment-of-passes-101628659829559.html

The state government will soon send a team comprising Trinamool Congress (TMC) ministers and legislators to raise the demand before the Centre. “The chief minister said that a team comprising ministers and legislators representing the constituencies, which are flooded, will soon head for Delhi and meet the union Jal Shakti minister to place the demand,” said a state minister, requesting anonymity. Senior TMC parliamentarians form both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha will also join the delegation to raise a demand for Central funds, a TMC leader said. The delegation is likely to head for Delhi soon as Parliament’s Monsoon Session is going on. Also Read | Widespread, heavy rain likely over N-E for 4-5 days: IMD“We have been repeatedly telling the Centre to sanction funds for the Ghatal master plan, but they are not implementing it,” Banerjee said on Tuesday. Last week, chief minister Banerjee had visited parts of Howrah such as Amta and Udaynarayanpur, which were hit by floods; on Tuesday, she visited Ghatal on to take stock of the situation. She called it a man-made flood as it was triggered after the Damodar Valley Corporation released water through its dam. Even though the water level is receding, several areas are still submerged. The Ghatal master plan was drawn in 2014 by the TMC government. According to the plan, the Centre and state government have to bear the cost of the ₹1,238 crore project on a 50:50 basis. As per the master plan, several projects will be undertaken to desilt the rivers in and around Ghatal in West Midnapore district, repair the canals and build a dam on the Shilabati river, among other steps to check recurring floods. “We have been hearing about this plan for several years now. Please visit the state government’s irrigation department website and search for the master plan. It will show you the ‘page is under construction’. This tells everything about why the plan has failed to take off till now,” said Jay Prakash Majumdar, BJP vice-president in West Bengal. Meanwhile the India Meteorological Department’s regional weather forecasting centre in Kolkata has warned of more rain this week. According to statistics shared last week, at least 23 people died and around 113,000 people had to be shifted to safer places.

Diversion of water from Kharasrota river will result in water scarcity in Kendrapara. The police cannot guard the project round the clock. We have decided that we will now allow supply of Kharasrota water to Bhadrak until the in-stream barrage is constructed,” said KBSS convenor and former Congress MLA of Aul Debendra Sharma.Also Read | Odisha announces sports infra project worth ₹693.35 croreSince the last two years, the people of Rajkanika are up in arms against the ₹892 crore mega drinking water project that would supply water from Kharasrota river in the area to 91 grampanchayats of Bhadrak district where groundwater has suffered saline ingress due to proximity to the Bay of Bengal. The people of Rajkanika fear that the drinking water project would not only result in the drying up of the riverbed, but deprive them of irrigation water to their farmlands and lead to acute drinking water crisis in the area. On October 16, more than 2,000 locals had formed a two kilometre-long human chain at Rajkanika to protest against the proposed project.The project is expected to solve the drinking water crisis for 650,000 people in 91 grampanchayats of Chandbali, Tihidi, Dhamnagar and Basudevpur blocks where the rampant drawal of groundwater over the years resulted in substantial draw-down of the groundwater table causing massive saline ingression in and around the villages.With the nearby rivers of Baitarani, Kansbans, Salandi and Mantei not having enough water to meet the requirement of people in these 91 grampanchayats, the state government in 2019 proposed the mega drinking water project to supply water would be supplied through a 15.5km long pipeline after treatment. By 2050, a maximum quantity of 86 million litres of water per day is proposed to be diverted from the river.The Kharasrota is a tributary of Brahmani river.“We suspect that the project will supply water to private companies in Bhadrak districts to run their plants and industries. Once the pipe water supply project starts the water level in Kharasrota will fall drastically and adversely affect farming in Kendrapada district. The project would also adversely affect the entire Bhitarakanika National Park as it is dependent for its survival on this river which is the only source of fresh water as the other rivers are saline in nature,” said secretary of the KBSS, Bidhan Das.A Bharatiya Janata Party leader last year had filed a petition against the project in the National Green Tribunal alleging various environmental damages due to the proposed project. But the tribunal dismissed the petition in November last year.However, Kendrapara district collector Amrit Ruturaj said the intake of water from Kharasrota would hardly affect the total flow in the river during the lean season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sec-144-imposed-in-odisha-s-kendrapara-amid-opposition-to-water-project-101628653529522.html

11-08-2021||Lucknow||PM Modi launches 2nd leg of Ujjwala scheme in Uttar Pradesh||In an indirect attack on various non-Bharaitya Janata Party (BJP) governments in the country in the past, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said it was unfortunate that people had to wait decades for basics like hospitals, roads and electricity, as he launched the second phase of the Ujjwala cooking gas scheme in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh.“We are entering 75th year of independence and when we see the progress made in the past seven and a half decades, we realise that certain conditions and situation could have been changed decades ago,” Modi said after launching Ujjwala 2.0 (Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana) and distributing LPG connections at a programme at Mahoba in Uttar Pradesh’s Bundelkhand region via videoconferencing.Union minister for petroleum and natural gas Hardeep Singh Puri and state chief minister Yogi Adityanath attended the programme with the latter making a token distribution of LPG connections on the occasion.The prime minister, who interacted with Ujjwala scheme’s five beneficiaries including one from Gorakhpur, used the occasion to highlight his government’s work on providing basic needs to the society. “Will our energy waste in fulfilling basic needs? How can a family or a society progress and realise big dreams if it has to struggle for basic needs?” he asked.“Our sisters and daughters will be able to contribute to the nation building only if their problems of kitchen and home are taken care of. We have worked on mission mode to resolve such issues,” the PM added.Modi referred to the upcoming Raksha Bandhan festival to connect with women, saying he was delighted to get blessings of his sisters well in advance.Keeping up with his recent messages on sports in the wake of the recently concluded Tokyo Olympics, the prime minister used the occasion to connect with the people of Bundelkhand, saying Ujjwala 2.0 was being launched from the land of brave, Mahoba, adding that the region is home to legendary hockey player Major Dhyanchand after whom the highest award for sportspersons has been recently named and it will inspire millions of the youth. He said by their exemplary performance at the Tokyo Olympics, the country’s sportspersons have given an indication about the future of sports.Giving statistical details about achievements of his government, he said under the first phase of Ujjwala scheme LPG connections have been given to 80 million women from the poor and deprived sections of society. The prime minister said India was close to achieving 100% gas connection coverage, adding that the number of gas connections distributed in the past seven years was higher than the total connections in the country till 2014.“We saw how much this helped during the Covid-19 pandemic. When there was no movement and businesses were closed, crores of poor families were given free gas cylinders for many months,” he said.“In the last six years, more than 11,000 new LPG distribution centres have opened across the country. Uttar Pradesh alone had less than 2,000 distribution centres in 2014. In UP now, there are 4,000 such centres giving employment to thousands of youths,” he added.Elaborating on the scheme, Modi said in Ujjwala 2.0 a self-declaration of address will work to get a LPG connection in other states as well. He said efforts were also being made to supply piped natural gas while expeditious work was being done to give PNG connections in UP and northeastern states at the earliest. The PM said a target to give PNG connections to 2.1 million households in over 50 districts of Uttar Pradesh has been set in the first phase. He added that efforts were also being made to boost use of CNG in transportation.Stating that the World Biofuel Day on Tuesday was a reminder about the targets on clean energy front, he mentioned plans to promote “gobar dhan” – tapping cow dung for energy. Modi said India was close to achieving the target of 10% blending of ethanol in petrol and would aim for 20% blending in coming years. He added that vehicles will use 100% ethanol in future.The prime minister said farmers from Uttar Pradesh will be benefitted the most with the option of making ethanol from sugarcane. He said ethanol worth ₹7 lakh crore was bought from producers last year. He said a number of units linked to ethanol and biofuel have come up in the state and plants were being set up in 70 districts to make compressed biogas. He also announced that three big complexes were coming up to make biogas from ‘parali’ including two at Badaun and Gorakhpur in UP and another at Bhatinda in Punjab.Meanwhile, CM Adityanath said 15 million families in the state availed the benefit of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana in its first phase.“Six years ago, the prime minister launched the first phase of Ujjwala Yojana from Ballia district in eastern UP. In the first phase of Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), 1.5 crore (15 million) families in Uttar Pradesh availed the benefit of the scheme,” he said.Rajendra Chaudhary, spokesperson for the Samajwadi Party, said, “Mahoba has been chosen as the venue to launch the scheme in view of 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. Prime Minister Narendra Modi should not indulge in politics of betrayal. Ujjawala has not helped the poor due to high cost of cylinder.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/pm-modi-launches-2nd-leg-of-ujjwala-scheme-in-uttar-pradesh-101628644142199.html
11-08-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal to launch 'faceless' transport services today in Delhi. Check details||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will launch the transport department's 'faceless' services today (i.e. on Wednesday, August 11). Confirming the launch earlier this week, Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot said that this unique initiative will allow citizens to apply for various transport-related services, including registering for a learner's driving license test, from the comfort of their homes. Since people will be able to apply and get various documents like registration certificates without having to show up at a motor licensing office (MLO), it will essentially make the process 'faceless'.However, the 'faceless' transportation services of the Delhi government will not allow a person to apply for a permanent driving license and vehicle fitness certificate in a similar manner, confirmed transport minister Kailash Gahlot earlier this week."All services except permanent driving license and vehicle fitness are now faceless," Gahlot was quoted as saying by news agency PTI, "...thereby meaning applicants don't have to visit transport authority offices."'Faceless' transport services will essentially make Delhi the first state or Union territory in the country to bring all transport-related services online. According to government officials, it will help people save their own hard-earned time and money by not having to physically visit the MLOs. Maharashtra is also reported to be trying out a similar model.Also Read | Delhi govt waives custody charges on impounded vehicles till September 30Kejriwal is expected to launch the 'faceless' transport services in Delhi today from the IP Estate MLO, and trials for online learning tests have already begun at the Sarai Kale Khan and Vasant Vihar offices. More than 50 people have also been provided learning licenses so far, said officials privy to the development.Kailash Gahlot, the transport minister of Delhi, was even seen congratulating on Twitter a resident who had given his learner's license test online. "You are one of the country's first to pass this facial recognition enabled E-LL test," Gahlot said after congratulating the applicant. "Delhiites get true freedom from long queues."Notably, the Delhi transport department had been working on providing certain essential services online since as early as February this year. The services included those related to driving license and registration certificates such as duplicate copies, change in address, international driving permit, and transfer of ownership.According to officials, the majority of transactions at the transport department offices are related to driving licenses and registration certificates. In 2019, over 1 million transactions were related to driving licenses, and nearly 1.3 million were related to registration certificates, records with the state transport department showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/arvind-kejriwal-delhi-faceless-transport-service-today-check-details-101628638906605.html
11-08-2021||Delhi||Man held for derogatory comments against Congress leader||A 30-year-old man from Uttam Nagar has been arrested for allegedly making anti-Muslim comments and derogatory remarks against Congress leader Alka Lamba in a viral video.The suspect, Vikas Sehrawat alias Mallik Sehrawat, was earlier arrested in March by the Ghaziabad police for delivering similar speeches in a viral video outside a temple before getting bail three months ago.DCP (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said they received a complaint against Sehrawat from Lamba on Monday. Lamba also tagged the Delhi Police in a post on Twitter and attached the purported hate speech video.DCP Thakur said Sehrawat is being questioned. “Our police team succeeded in tracing the accused in the area of police station Bindapur and he (Sehrawat) was taken in police custody from his house,” he said.In his videos, Sehrawat describes himself as a Hindu leader and a nationalist. Earlier, he was accused of threatening to kill a journalist and AAP lawmaker Amanatullah Khan.Lamba, the former MLA from Chandni Chowk, said, “He is a notorious man and belongs to some right wing organisation. He is connected to Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati, priest of the Dasna temple. Some months ago, he had made derogatory comments against me and the Ghaziabad police had arrested him. But even after coming out on bail, he makes such inflammatory comments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-held-for-derogatory-comments-against-congress-leader-101628633554434.html
11-08-2021||Delhi||New Metro e-buses to be rolled out from August 12||Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) will start plying its first-ever batch of electric feeder buses on a trial basis along two Metro routes -- from Shastri Park metro station to Gokulpuri Metro station and to Mother Dairy -- from Thursday, senior officials said on Tuesday.Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC, said the trial will see 25 low-floor e-buses plying in the two routes.“Only passengers having a Delhi Metro smart card or Metro DTC smart card will be allowed to avail the services on these e-buses. They can use their smart card to pay for the cashless travel since these buses are fully contactless and conductor-less, enabling entry and exit through turnstiles in the bus by using the smart card... Services shall be available for Metro commuters only,” Dayal said.Senior officials said that passengers will be permitted entry only at Metro stations, and that the buses will stop only at the designated stops for dropping the passengers.“No entry of passengers will be permitted at other stops on the route. Similarly, for buses going to Metro stations, entry shall be allowed from all stops, but exit shall be allowed only at Metro stations. This is to ensure that only genuine Metro passengers use this service,” DMRC said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-metro-e-buses-to-be-rolled-out-from-august-12-101628633385119.html
11-08-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: On Zafar’s way...||It no longer needs to be known as Delhi’s Fleet Street, the London road famous for newspaper offices. At least some newspapers that were once located here have wholly or partly moved to other areas. And yet it stays rich—with history. Here’s a walk down the Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg.Reach ITO crossing. Start walking down the road named after Delhi’s last emperor. On the right stands a building decked with mosaic panels, showing figures in various costumes. Shankar’s International Dolls Museum houses more than 60,000 dolls from across the world, including a Flamenco dancer from Barcelona, a jazz musician from Harlem, and a doll “presented by Madame Tito, the First Lady of Yugoslavia.” The dolls currently remain unvisited, the museum is closed due to the pandemic.Keep walking, and turn right into a lane. Beyond is the Delhi Gate Qabristan. Many Old Delhi dwellers are in eternal sleep here—one new grave is of Chawri Bazar’s Haji Miyan, the Walled City’s living landmark who died in the Covid’s second surge. The legendary cook Kallu Mian Nihariwalle of Turkman Gate bazaar, who died some years ago, is also buried here. One of the most recent graves is of Chitli Qabar’s Muhammed Bi, a great-grandmother who died some weeks ago of age-related causes at 98. The cemetery is pock-marked with giant unwieldy trees. Bougainvillea creepers crisscross over some of the narrow paths. The graves spread out as unsystematically as the houses in the Walled City. Cats roam boldly.(Another turning in the road goes to the ruins of Feroze Shah Kotla. But it is so extensive that it needs an excursion exclusive to itself.)Walk back towards the main road, and keep straight till you reach Shaheedi Park, the lovely park rarely talked of. It has Bhagat Singh’s statue. The park slab informs that it was built in the very place where, in September 1928, the revolutionary freedom fighter “decided to form the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association to establish an independent Socialist Republic in India.” The garden also has a Sufi shrine—a grave covered with green and red chadars.Further ahead, the road divider turns into a weedy island with a stone gateway. This is Khooni Darwaza, or the “bloodied gateway”. Old Delhi gossipmongers insist that blood drips from its stone walls during monsoons. Bahadur Shah Zafar’s sons were killed here by the British after the uprising of 1857.The road ends with Parsi Anjuman, a centre for Delhi’s tiny Parsi community. It has the only Parsi fire temple in north India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-on-zafar-s-way-101628633266168.html

11-08-2021||Delhi||Tihar DSP, four others booked in FIR over gangster’s murder||Prawesh Lamaprawesh.lama@hindustantimes.comNew DelhiOn the night of August 3, when a Delhi Police officer reached Tihar’s jail number 3 after getting a distress call on the 112 helpline number from alleged gangster Ankit Gujjar’s family about him being assaulted inside the prison, the jail officers told police that Gujjar suffered “simple injuries”, according to a First Information Report (FIR) filed on Monday evening against the Tihar deputy superintendent Narendra Meena in the alleged murder of the gangster.HT has seen the copy of the FIR, in which police have also noted allegations of bribery and extortion by jail officers. Along with Meena, Gujjar’s family has also named three constables and an assistant superintendent in their complaint. However, the accused have not been named in the FIR.A prison officer, who asked not to be named, said the deputy superintendent and three others have been suspended pending magisterial inquiry and police investigation.A prisoner, who was released on bail the same night, told Gujjar’s family that he saw jail officers assaulting Gujjar.When an assistant sub inspector(ASI) from Hari Nagar police station visited Tihar as part of the probe, the jail staff told the ASI that “Gujjar was fine, he was given medicines for simple injuries and a deputy superintendent was admitted to the Deen Dayal Upadhyay(DDU) hospital”, the FIR said.According to the FIR, the police officer returned after he was told that Gujjar and two others assaulted jail officers during an inspection of their cell.The following morning, Delhi Police received information from the jail officials that Gujjar was found dead. When police visited the jail this time, they found two other injured prisoners (earlier lodged with Gujjar) in another cell. Gujjar’s post-mortem report said “cause of death was due to haemorrhage” because of the “cumulative effect of multiple blunt force injuries”.Until his arrest in August 2020, Gujjar,29, was one of western Uttar Pradesh’s most wanted persons. Accused in at least eight murders among other criminal cases, Gujjar carried a reward of ₹1.25 lakh at the time of his arrest --- ₹1 lakh announced by Uttar Pradesh police and ₹25,000 by Delhi police.According to the FIR, Gujjar’s mother, Geeta, has accused jail officers of demanding ₹1 lakh as protection money inside the prison. As evidence, Geeta has also submitted a recording of a phone call between Gujjar and his sister, Shivani, that purportedly took place on August 2.“Ankit had told my daughter (Shivani) that he had paid ₹50,000 to the jail officers but was unable to pay the remaining money. He told Shivani he was worried for his life as he was unable to pay the money,” read Geeta’s statement to the police, in which she has demanded the arrest of the jail officers.The FIR also mentions the version of the jail officers as noted by the police’s investigating officer.Deputy superintendent Meena told the police that they conducted an inspection inside Gujjar’s cell on April 3 afternoon and found a cell phone, data cable and knife. Meena said Gujjar and two other inmates of the cell number 3 assaulted him and other officials, after which Gujjar was transferred to another cell and the other two prisoners were sent to a different cell. The jail officers told the investigating officer that between 6am and 6.30am on August 4, when they went to check on Gujjar during the roll call of inmates, he was found unconscious and was rushed to the jail hospital. Gujjar was declared brought dead.According to the autopsy report conducted by a board of doctors, noted that Gujjar had deep wounds on his neck, left occipital region, right eyebrows and haemorrhage over the cerebral hemispheres of brain.Advocate Rishi Sood, who filed a petition in court seeking FIR against the jail officials, said, “Police registered an FIR after the court’s direction. We want police to conduct a thorough investigation and arrest all officers who were involved. The CCTV footage of the prison is important and must be preserved carefully.“The court has directed that the CCTV footage be preserved. In their report, the jail officers have mentioned that they used minimum force, which is a lie as is evident from the post-mortem report findings. We have been told that prison officers are threatening other inmates to take the blame for my client’s murder or claim that there was a riot inside the jail. This is false and baseless,” advocate Sood contended,||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tihar-dsp-four-others-booked-in-fir-over-gangster-s-murder-101628630752838.html
11-08-2021||Delhi||Jantar Mantar event: Court to hear Ashwini Upadhyay’s bail plea today||A Delhi court on Tuesday sent lawyer and former BJP spokesperson Ashwini Upadhyay, along with three others, to judicial custody for two days in connection with the alleged anti-Muslim sloganeering at an event on Jantar Mantar on August 8.Duty magistrate Tanvi Khurrana also sent two more accused, Vinit Bajpai and Deepak Singh, to police custody for one day, rejecting the police’s request for three days’ custodial interrogation. The judge said that the “time period sought for police custody remand is not justified”. The court said the purpose for which the police was seeking a remand of three days can be conducted within one day.Additional public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava, representing the probe agency, said the police will require the custody of the accused to reveal the connection of the accused persons with other outfits, to find the source of funding for the event, the hidden agenda behind commission of offence, the object thereof, the modus operandi behind the huge gathering, the source of spreading information and identification of other accused persons.The police urged the court to remand Upadhyay and three other accused, Preet Singh, Vinod Sharma and Deepak Kumar to 14 days judicial custody.Shrivastava submitted that the accused may create “unruly situation”, and it will not be appropriate to release them in wake of important events such as the Independence Day and the ongoing monsoon session of the Parliament.The judge, directing that Upadhyay’s bail application be heard on Wednesday, also told the police to read out the contents of the FIR to him.Upadhyay’s counsel, Ashwani Dubey said despite arresting his client, the police did not give a copy of the FIR to him.“My client is cooperating in the investigation and as soon as he received a call at midnight, he rushed to the police station at 2am. Since then, he is not being allowed to take calls. He has also not been provided with a copy of the FIR and is not being allowed to meet his family,” Dubey said.Shrivastava said the FIR cannot be given to the accused because it is sensitive and “they are under no obligation to supply the document in line with a Supreme Court order”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/jantar-mantar-event-court-to-hear-ashwini-upadhyay-s-bail-plea-today-101628629826002.html

11-08-2021||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi govt to make 7 makeshift hospitals in next 6 months||The Delhi government will build seven makeshift hospitals with 7,000 ICU beds in the next six months to prepare for a potential third wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), state health minister Satyendar Jain said on Tuesday.Jain said he spoke to deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s finance minister, to seek approval for the projects on Tuesday. These seven makeshift hospitals will be constructed by the public works department (PWD) in Sarita Vihar, Shalimar Bagh, Sultanpuri, Kirari, Raghubir Nagar, GTB hospital, and Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya, he added. “The hospitals will be completed within the next six months positively and all the concerned departments will be working on a war footing. Though these hospitals will be temporary, they are being constructed from a long-term perspective as Covid-19 is here to stay at least in the near future,” Jain added.The Delhi government has put in place a graded response action plan for the steps that are to be taken at various stages of the third wave, in case Covid-19 cases begin to spike again. The administration is planning to set up nearly 37,000 Covid beds, excluding those in Covid care centres. Of the 37,000 beds, 12,000 will be ICU beds.Jain said he believes the third wave, if it comes, will be milder than the second wave in Delhi at least because majority of the cases that emerged during April-May this year were caused by the Delta variant, implying majority of the population may already have antibodies.80% samples tested showed Delta variant“In the tests done during the second wave in Delhi, we could see that more than 80% of the samples showed the presence of the Delta variant. The genome sequencing of the samples during the second wave and after have been done; the results of both show that about 80% of the sample population was infected by the Delta variant of the virus,” said Jain.“Since the Delta variant originated in India, we have already faced the wrath of this variant during the second wave. The other countries need to prepare themselves now as the variant is spreading there. Delhi has already battled and overcome the Delta variant wave. Analysis of the reports from Delhi that were sent to ICMR also pointed out that Delhi was battling the Delta variant during the second wave. Therefore, I don’t think that the Delta variant should be a cause of concern for us anymore as the entire second wave was because of the Delta variant,” the minister said.In the last wave, the Delhi government prepared 22,000-23,000 beds of which 6,000 were ICU beds. “This time we have doubled the number of the ICU beds and have added more beds overall as well. Along with this, the Delhi government has also started a graded response system,” he said.The graded response action plan, which harks back to a similar mechanism to fight air pollution during pre-winter months, was drafted by an expert committee formed by the Delhi government and approved by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on July 8. It classifies outbreak severity into four bands – yellow, amber, orange and red – with each representing a more severe outbreak and, thus, stricter curbs than the one preceding it.According to the plan, private offices, malls, weekly markets and the Metro will be shut down in Delhi if the test positivity rate (TPR) rises above 2%, and the city will be put under a curfew if the number breaches 5%, according to a new Covid-19 action plan approved by authorities that sets clear thresholds for curbs that kick in from as low as 0.5% TPR in order to scuttle an outbreak.The colour-coded classifications take into account three factors: the test positivity rate over two consecutive days, new cases over a seven-day period, and the average weekly hospital occupancy rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-delhi-govt-to-make-7-makeshift-hospitals-in-next-6-months-101628627661846.html

11-08-2021||Chandigarh||Amarinder meets Amit Shah, seeks 25 CAPF companies, anti-drone gadgets for BSF||Amid an escalating threat to the state’s security from across the border, Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday asked Union home minister Amit Shah to urgently provide 25 companies of central armed police forces (CAPF) and anti-drone gadgets for the Border Security Force (BSF) for protection against Pakistan-backed terror outfits. Citing the recent heavy influx of weapons, hand grenades and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) into the state, the CM told Shah at a meeting in New Delhi that the security situation was grave and needed the Centre’s immediate intervention with Pakistan’s ISI also raising the ante ahead of the Independence Day and in the run-up to the Punjab assembly polls. Also, Amarinder sought CAPF deployment in Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Mohali, Patiala, Bathinda, Phagwara and Moga districts, as well as anti-drone technology for the BSF at the borders, according to an official release. He pointed to the threat to the security of vital infrastructure, installations and public events being attended by individuals facing “high threat”. Citing inputs from central and state agencies, corroborated by disclosures made by arrested terrorists, the CM said potential individual and mass indiscriminate targets include trains, buses and temples, prominent farmer leaders, RSS shakhas/offices, RSS, BJP and Shiv Sena leaders based in Punjab, deras, Nirankari bhawans and samagams. Specific inputs about 5 such farmer leaders had been received but they had refused to take security offered by Punjab and Haryana police. “With the Punjab assembly elections scheduled in early 2022, many militant and radical operatives are being pressurised by the ISI to carry out terror attacks,” he warned. The CM told Shah that between July 4 and August 8, 2021, foreign based pro-Khalistani entities, working in close collaboration with the ISI, had managed to induct over 30 pistols, one MP4 Rifle, one AK-47 Rifle, around 35 hand-grenades, sophisticated laboratory made tiffin bombs, over 6 Kg RDX and assorted hardware for fabrication of IEDs (9 detonators, 1 multiple timer device and fuse-wire). Raises farm laws, fertiliser shortageCiting social, economic and security implications of the prolonged farmers’ agitation, Amarinder pressed Shah for immediate repeal of the farm laws. The CM expressed concern over the fear of elements from across the border trying to exploit disgruntlement against the government, seeking an enduring and expeditious solution to the farmers’ concerns. “While these protests have so far been largely peaceful, one can sense rising tempers, especially as the state moves towards elections in early 2022,” he warned. Amarinder also flagged the urgent need to compensate farmers for the management of paddy straw at the rate of ₹100 per quintal and to address the growing fear of shortage of DAP.

11-08-2021||Chandigarh||HC restrains trial court from proceeding further in I-T cases against Amarinder, son||The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Tuesday asked a Ludhiana trial court not to proceed further in income tax cases against Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and his son Raninder Singh.The high court was hearing the income tax department’s plea that the trial court be restrained from passing the final order, pending the listing of three petitions on the issue before the bench. The IT department had told the bench that the trial court is likely to pass the final order in view of a revisional court quashing the summoning order against the two. Both are aware of the proceedings in the high court but have not appeared as notice could not be served on them since 2019, when the HC took cognisance of the matter. After February 2020, the matter could not be taken up due to the pandemic. On July 22, the I-T department had moved the HC demanding the hearing in its 2019 plea be advanced.“This court is of the opinion that the CJM should not pass any further orders on the complaint,” the bench of Justice GS Sandhawalia observed, posting the matter for November 18 and also asking that both be served the notices for adjourned date. The I-T department had moved the high court in 2019 against the November 2018 order of the court of additional sessions judge, Ludhiana, quashing the summoning order passed against Amarinder and Raninder in these cases. A trial court had earlier issued summons to both to appear in person in three cases of alleged tax evasion and amassing wealth in other countries.Both are facing allegations of furnishing false statements and willful omission in providing required information to the I-T department that had filed criminal complaints against them in a Ludhiana court in 2016.As per the department, the two were beneficiaries of foreign assets maintained and controlled through various business entities and also of foreign bank accounts with a Geneva-based bank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-restrains-trial-court-from-proceeding-further-in-i-t-cases-against-amarinder-son-101628626403781.html

11-08-2021||Delhi||Covid-19 in Delhi: Manish Sisodia calls for thorough probe into oxygen deaths||Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday said a thorough probe was needed into deaths related to oxygen shortage during the last Covid-19 wave in the Capital, and asserted that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government will soon share the details in this regard with the Centre.“We faced a major oxygen crisis during the last wave of Covid-19. As a government, we are taking all steps to ensure that it doesn’t happen again in case of potential future waves. But we appeal to the central government to take the issue seriously. I have come across news reports today which said that the central government has claimed to have sought response on oxygen deaths from 13 states so far of which only one has accepted deaths caused by oxygen shortage. We have also learnt that states were given time till August 13 to respond to the Centre’s queries on the issue. However, we (Delhi government) have received no letter from the central government with any query on oxygen deaths,” said Sisodia in a video press briefing on Tuesday.At its peak, Delhi recorded around 28,300 cases in a day, and a positivity rate exceeding 36% on April 20 and 22 respectively. Around that time, at least 31 Covid patients allegedly died due to oxygen shortage in two hospitals. Several deaths linked to oxygen shortage were reported from other states, too. However, a political blame game ensued between the Centre and the Opposition when the Union government on July 20 told Parliament that no state identified oxygen shortage as the cause of deaths caused by the second wave of the pandemic.Health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said last month that the data was based on reports from states and UTs. During a discussion in the Rajya Sabha last month, he said that state governments were asked to report all such deaths.Sisodia said, “We accept that the oxygen crisis happened during the last wave of the pandemic. And, without any probe it is difficult to say if that has caused deaths. I am going deeper into whether it has or has not. I am stressing on the importance of thorough investigation into cases of deaths that can be related to oxygen shortage.”On May 4, the Delhi government told the Delhi high court that an expert committee could not ascertain whether 21 deaths at Jaipur Golden Hospital in north Delhi’s Rohini happened because of oxygen shortage. The leaders of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) later cited this submission to accuse the AAP of hypocrisy on oxygen-related deaths.The AAP government in Delhi criticised the central government, saying it did not let the city government probe such matters by setting up a larger expert committee. Health minister Satyendar Jain pointed out that the submission in court on deaths in Jaipur Golden hospital was based on “preliminary” findings and the matter needed more investigation.In a status report before a local court, the Delhi Police on August 3 said that the deaths at Jaipur Golden Hospital were not caused by lack of oxygen. However, families of the people who lost their lives termed it a “whitewash” by the authorities and demanded a fair probe into the deaths.“The death summaries mention respiratory failure or cardiac arrest. It’s written in a technical language. We are demanding a proper investigation,” said Erick Massey whose mother Delphin Massey was among those who died at the Rohini hospital.The family members have alleged that the hospital management should be punished, but police, with mala fide intention, have neither arrested nor set up an inquiry against the hospital.Sisodia on Tuesday said all states should be given enough time to “investigate” such matters. “Without that, how can they draw conclusions. Though we have not been asked yet, we have decided to share such details with the Centre very soon. And I appeal that it should be made public along with details of other states,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-in-delhi-manish-sisodia-calls-for-thorough-probe-into-oxygen-deaths-101628623958159.html
11-08-2021||Chandigarh||18-point agenda, Sidhu figure in Captain-Sonia meet||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday informed Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi about the progress made on the 18-point to-do list and continuous criticism of the state government by newly appointed state chief Navjot Singh Sidhu ahead of next year’s assembly polls. Amarinder, who was given the 18-point agenda by the party high command for implementation, was meeting the Congress chief for the first time since his trenchant critic’s appointment as the state unit president a little over a fortnight ago. After the meeting, All India Congress Committee general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat said he (Amarinder) informed the Congress president about the action initiated by the state government on the agenda and the progress achieved. Rawat said she advised that the state government and the party organisation have to work together. “The Congress president also asked me to ensure that both (Amarinder and Sidhu) work within their respective limits, but cooperate with each other,” he told journalists on continued factionalism in the state unit. The chief minister updated Sonia on the steps to cancel the controversial power purchase agreements (PPAs), progress made in sacrilege and police firing cases and action taken against drugs, persons familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. Amarinder termed the meeting as extremely satisfying. “Met @INCIndia president #SoniaGandhi ji in Delhi this evening to discuss various state related issues. Spent an extremely satisfying one hour with her,” the chief minister said in a tweet posted by his media adviser after the meeting. The meeting was closely watched in the state Congress which has been gripped by a sense of disquiet due to the ongoing battle of wits between the rival camps. Sidhu was elevated as part of the high command-brokered formula to put up a united face, but the plan has not worked so far. The new Punjab Congress chief and other detractors, who had rallied behind him, have continued to take digs at the government, questioning it on the 18-point agenda to try and corner the chief minister. Sidhu and cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa had raised questions over the government’s handling of drug cases and action against gangsters, respectively. Though the meeting came amid talk of a possible cabinet reshuffle, Rawat said there was no discussion on it. “The chief minister did stress the need for balance as there is no Valmiki minister,” he said.Earlier, poll strategist Prashant Kishor called on Amarinder after he reached Delhi for his meeting with the Congress president. Kishor had resigned as the chief minister’s principal adviser last week, stating that he was a “temporary break” from active role in public life. Amarinder wanted Kishor, who had worked with him in 2017, to manage the party’s campaign again. Political circles in Delhi have been abuzz with talk of his induction into the Congress with a senior leadership role.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/18point-agenda-sidhu-figure-in-captain-sonia-meet-101628625744060.html

The sleuths of the central agency seized some documents during search of the premises, it is learnt. In November 2020, Punjab vigilance bureau (VB) had booked 11 people, including then naib tehsildar Varinderpal Singh Dhoot, then kanungo Rughubir Singh, patwari Iqbal Singh, namabrdar Gurnam Singh and property dealer Sham Lal and others, for allegedly usurping a village common land Seonk village of Majri block in Mohali district. Prime accused Dhoot and Sham Lal were also arrested in November last year. The case dates back to 2017 when Dhoot was posted as the naib tehsildar in Majri. He allegedly sold off 99 acres of shamlat land in Seonk village in connivance with his junior revenue officials and private individuals fraudulently, leading to losses to the government exchequer in crores of rupees. According to the FIR, the accused prepared forged land documents and got the village common land registered in the name of people known to them in lieu of hefty amount of money. Later, the land was sold in plots at high rates. On Tuesday, ED searched Dhoot’s properties in Hoshiarpur and Chandigarh, besides those belonging to other accused in Mohali and Ludhiana. The ED had registered Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) against the accused revenue officials and private persons under the Prevention to Money Laundering Act (PMLA) at its Jalandhar office in March this year. A vigilance bureau official on condition of anonymity said Dhoot was close to a Hoshiarpur-based influential Congress politician and the two once shared a house in Sector 8, Chandigarh. In May this year, Punjab vigilance bureau again booked Dhoot and property dealer Sham Lal, along with other nine accused, for the manipulation of revenue records during the process of division and mutation of Majrian village in Majri tehsil of Mohali district. He allegedly transferred ownership of ‘khewat’ number to known beneficiaries to make huge profits illegally through power of attorney. DA inquiry against Dhoot still on Punjab vigilance bureau is yet to complete its reinvestigation launched in February this year into the allegations of disproportionate assets against Dhoot. The directions for reinvestigation came after new facts emerged in the corruption case against him. In November last year, HT had reported that Dhoot faced another case of disproportionate assets which was pending with the vigilance headquarters, after the Jalandhar VB “watered down” the investigation and recommended departmental action. The agency had detected several monetary transactions among builders, developers and Dhoot, besides investments in two prime marriage palaces in Hoshiarpur district. The vigilance is also probing the source of funds for Dhoot’s house in Sector 8, Chandigarh. When contacted, vigilance bureau officer Daljinder Singh Dhillon confirmed that the inquiry was not yet complete as the information is being verified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-shamlat-land-scam-ed-raids-14-properties-of-revenue-officials-property-dealers-101628625683681.html

The victims’ mother said she had four children - two sons and two daughters,” the SHO said.“On the night of August 5, the four accused, who are labourers, barged into her rented room. They gangraped the girls and gave them pesticides. When the mother raised an alarm, they threatened of killing both her minor sons as well,” the cop said.“The woman rushed both her daughters to a hospital in Delhi, where they died. The accused threatened the woman to state snakebite as the reason behind her daughters’ death,” the SHO added.He said they have arrested all four accused under Sections 302 (murder), 376-D (gang rape), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance with common intention), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Sections 4, 6 and 12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.“We will produce the accused before a local court on Wednesday and seek their remand to investigate the case from all angles,” the SHO added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sonepat-shocker-minor-sisters-poisoned-to-death-after-gangrape-101628625623815.html

He said under the scheme, a helipad is being constructed at the south portal of Atal Tunnel.

Govt considering constituting Swarn Aayog: CM Himachal CM Jai Ram Thakur on Tuesday said that the state government was mulling constituting a Swarn Aayog (commission for upper caste) on the demand of people. Congress MLA Vikramaditya Singh raised a point of order after the question hour. He said members of Kshatriya Mahasabha had met him regarding their demand. He said the government should think about it by rising above politics. Responding to the Congress legislator, Thakur said he (Singh) had invited the people of Kshatriya Mahasabha and raised the issue in the House. The CM said members of Kshatriya Mahasabha had also come to him. He said they used abusive language outside his residence. “Himachal Pradesh is a peaceful state. It is not proper to raise slogans against any caste,” he added. The CM said Swarn Aayog has been constituted in only two states of the country and the government is studying all aspects and will take a decision at the right time.He said the government is studying the commission formed by Madhya Pradesh government.Cong stages walkoutDissatisfied with the reply of Himachal health minister Rajiv Sezal over corona crisis, Congress legislators staged a walkout.They alleged that Sezal did not reply to the issues they raised during the discussion, which was initiated by Congress MLA Inderdutt Lakhanpal on Monday and 17 members had participated in it. Congress members alleged that the state government failed to tackle the second wave. CM Jai Ram Thakur, while intervening, castigated the Opposition over the walkout. Terming it irresponsible, he said the Opposition should have rather listened to the measures adopted by the government to fight the pandemic. He said no such situation arose in the state where a patient was without a bed. He said patients from other states also came to Himachal for treatment, while reiterating that there was no shortage of oxygen. Giving details of the measures taken by his government, Thakur said there were 800 ventilators in the state. He said that the Centre provided 500 ventilators to Himachal.

11-08-2021||Chandigarh||Pakistan back to playing its ugly tricks: J&K DGP||J&K director general of police (DGP) Dilbag Singh on Tuesday said that “after a brief lull following renewed truce deal between the two DGMOs on February 25, infiltration into Jammu and Kashmir resumed” and added that “terror camps across the border were still intact.” He also said that 57 Kashmiri youths, who had gone to Pakistan on valid passport and visa, joined terror outfits there. “Out of them, 17 crossed the LoC and got killed in various encounters. Thirteen of them are still active and we are keeping an eye on them,” he told reporters at Rajouri. “Pakistan’s terror camps across the border being run by ISI and other sister agencies are still intact. There is no let up in their activities,” he said. In recent times there were three encounters in Rajouri sector — Daddal in Nowshera, Sunderbani and Pangai in Thannamandi. “All these were fresh groups, which had infiltrated recently,” he added. The DGP said that the four terrorists, who were eliminated in Bandipora on July 23 and 24, had infiltrated from Machail and Gurez sectors. The DGP also informed that a new and disturbing trend has come to the fore. “We have observed a trend that many youths in 2017-18 travelled to Pakistan. We have 57 such cases before us…they went to Pakistan on valid documents but joined terror activities there. Seventeen of them are still in Pakistan and we are keeping an eye on them as well,” he said. The DGP said this was the reason behind more strictness of late on granting student visa to those desirous of visiting Pakistan. “In Bandipora, where we killed four terrorists, we had a mix of two Pakistani and two local terrorists. So, they have now adopted this strategy of mixing two Pakistani terrorists and two locals,” he added. The DGP said that Pakistani agencies were at work and wanted to activate “old contacts” to spread terrorism in Jammu. “But their efforts have been foiled successfully so far and we will keep doing so. Pakistan raised a new Ghazwat Force to create communal disturbance in J&K, but we neutralised it,” he said. He admitted that there were some terror activities in Reasi, Kishtwar and Doda but the security forces were keeping an eye. He added that the attack on IAF station in Jammu on June 27 and dropping of weapons, IEDs, narcotics and cash by drones were all new modes of operation of Pakistan and accordingly, the security forces in J&K have strengthened their grids to tackle the new challenges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pakistan-back-to-playing-its-ugly-tricks-j-k-dgp-101628625577170.html

11-08-2021||Chandigarh||Farm stir: Toll suspension causing ₹4.8-cr daily loss to 24 BOT projects||The farmers’ stir in Punjab and Haryana against the Centre’s three agriculture laws has led to toll suspension in 24 road projects, causing an aggregate revenue loss of ₹4.80 crore per day, according to rating agency CARE Ratings. The projects — 13 build-operate-transfer (BOT) national highways and 11 BOT state highways — have suffered an estimated revenue loss of ₹1,060 crore till July 31 due to the ongoing agitation. The farmers, mostly from the two agrarian northern states, have been protesting against the three agriculture marketing laws, passed by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre, for the past more than eight months. They laid siege to toll plazas and have been allowing free passage to vehicles. Though their implementation has been stayed by the Supreme Court, the farmer unions have refused to budge till the three controversial laws are repealed. Barring a few toll plazas, toll collection on most state and national highways in the two states has remained suspended for the past several months. These BOT road projects are in addition to the highways managed and maintained by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) which has also suffered toll revenue loss. There are no signs of the agitation ending anytime soon as both the central government and the farmer unions have not had any talks in the past six months. Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) chief Joginder Singh said they would not allow toll plazas to operate till the time the Centre accepts their demands. “They (private companies) collect money from people who are now benefitting from free passage,” he said, dismissing the revenue loss claims. CARE Ratings, in a statement on Monday, said the disruption of toll collections for state projects since October 2020 accentuated with no fee collection at toll plazas since December. The NHAI, the nodal agency for development of national highway projects, had in July decided to compensate the private highway developers for their toll revenue loss, acknowledging the farmers’ stir as an “indirect political force majeure (FM) event”. ‘Projects may opt for termination’ It said that nine out of NHAI’s 13 build-operate-transfer projects in Punjab and Haryana were facing liquidity constraints even prior to the FM event due to significant underperformance in toll collection. It foresees these stressed BOT projects opting for termination of concession due to sustained force majeure. This is likely to comprise projects worth ₹4,800 crore opting for termination. In the rating agency’s view, project termination risk is perceived lower for 11 BOT projects of Punjab Infrastructure Development Board (PIDB) with an aggregate cost of ₹740 crore. These road projects had relatively lower outstanding debt and were self-sustainable prior to the farmers’ stir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farm-stir-toll-suspension-causing-4-8-cr-daily-loss-to-24-bot-projects-101628625563763.html

The newly-appointed state chief met them as part of the meetings being held with party leaders before the long-awaited revamp of the organisational set-up of the state unit and to understand bottlenecks in the welfare of state’s OBCs. At the meeting, several party leaders, including MLAs, spoke about the lack of adequate representation in the state government and non-cooperation from district officials, besides raising issues relating to their areas. Moga MLA Harjot Kamal Singh said that several leaders pressed for representation in the government and various bodies in proportion to their population, adding that OBCs constitute 31% of the state’s population. Nawanshahr MLA Angad Saini said the issue of resentment among the backward classes over no representation in the state cabinet also came up. A party statement said that nine MLAs were among those who attended the two-hour-long deliberations held by the state unit president during which issues of reservation and labour welfare were also stressed upon.

This is the third time within a week that Mumbai has faced a shortage of vaccine stock, due to which some public vaccine centres had to remain closed. In its statement on Tuesday night, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said, “Vaccination will be held at limited BMC and state vaccination centres tomorrow, between 9am and 5pm.” The BMC received 45,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses on Saturday night, facilitating the vaccination drive in the city on Monday. Following this, Mumbai has not received more vaccine doses. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner and in-charge of BMC’s public health department, said, “We have not received vaccine doses after Saturday. It is likely that we will receive some doses on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the centres which have stock available will continue the drive on Wednesday. Moreover, the BMC has doses of Covaxin, so some centres will administer there.”On Tuesday night, the BMC tweeted that 11 public vaccination centres will administer Covishield on Wednesday, and 13 public centres will administer Covaxin. On Tuesday, 43,003 beneficiaries were vaccinated, of which 12,973 received their second dose, and 30,030 received their first dose.

11-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra Covid task force gives nod to reopen malls, eateries||The Maharashtra Covid task force, in its discussion with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, has given its go-ahead to reopen malls and extend the timings for eateries and restaurants. The task force is preparing a standard operating procedure (SOP) for the state to allow reopening of malls and extend timings of eateries and restaurants beyond the current deadline of 4pm. However, the final call will be taken by the CM. Ministers and senior officials said the chief minister could take a decision on further relaxation of curbs after Independence Day. They added that opening up all activities in one go will not be “prudent”, and therefore, the CM is moving cautiously. Thackeray on Sunday announced that those who have taken two doses of vaccines will be able to travel in suburban local trains from August 15. Maharashtra, meanwhile, added 5,609 fresh Covid cases on Tuesday, taking the tally to 6,363,442. It added 137 fatalities, pushing the toll to 134,201. The active case count in the state stood at 66,123. Mumbai added 239 fresh Covid-19 cases and five fatalities, taking its total to 737,954 and toll to 15,959, respectively. Active cases in Mumbai stood at 4,501. In the past 24 hours, the state tested 179,402 samples, and had a positivity rate of 3.12%. “The SOP to reopen malls and allow restaurants and eateries to operate till 10pm is being prepared. The task force opined that mall employees, workers in the shops have to be double vaccinated. A mechanism on who will be allowed inside malls is being worked out. The chief minister will take a call once the SOP is submitted,” the official said, requesting anonymity. Task force chief Dr Sanjay Oak refused to comment on the development. State minister and guardian minister of Mumbai city Aslam Shaikh said representatives from restaurants industry want timings increased till 10pm. “The government is still deliberating on their demands. The government must be given time to reopen everything. Things will be streamlined in a week... Restaurants will be allowed more time to operate at an appropriate time,” Shaikh said. The task force, according to another state official, has cautioned the state on reopening of religious places and pushing back reopening of secondary schools in urban areas till Diwali at least. State health minister Rajesh Tope said the CM will decide on further restrictions soon. “We must wait and watch for a few days...the CM will decide soon. Currently, restaurants are operating at 50% capacity. With regards to temples [places of worship], public functions, weddings etc, we think we must wait more. If we hastily open up things it can lead to more transmission,” Tope said. Mumbai and the cities and towns in Mumbai Metropolitan Region collectively added 707 new cases and reported 19 deaths. A chunk of infections on Tuesday were reported from Ahmednagar, Pune, Solapur, Satara, Kolhapur, Sangli Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri districts. Collectively, the eight districts and urban (municipal corporation) areas added 4,326 fresh cases and 97 fatalities. These areas contributed 77.12% of the total cases and 70.8% of the fatalities reported on Tuesday. Sherry Bhatia, President, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), in a statement, said, “We would like to thank the State Task Force headed by Dr Sanjay Oak for recommending the easing of restrictions on restaurants. In our last week’s meeting, the Hon’ble Chief Minister had assured the industry that he would personally discuss the subject with the State COVID Task Force and arrive at a decision soon. This is a big relief for hotels and restaurants across Mumbai.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-covid-task-force-gives-nod-to-reopen-malls-eateries-101628625023779.html
11-08-2021||Chandigarh||2020 hooch deaths: Accused Ludhiana businessman gets bail for want of evidence||A court in Tarn Taran has granted bail to a Ludhiana-based businessman, one of the main accused in Punjab’s worst-ever hooch tragedy that claimed nearly 140 lives last year, as the special investigation team (SIT) could not find any substantial evidence against him in its probe that was completed a few months ago.Rajeev Joshi (51), owner of RC Joshi and Company, Ludhiana, was arrested by the police for allegedly supplying two drums of methyl alcohol to Ravinder Singh, alias Pinka of Moga, also an accused. The police had said the methyl alcohol was further used for preparing spurious illicit liquor. Two SITs were formed to investigate the case — one under the supervision of deputy inspector general (DIG Ferozepur range) Hardial Singh Mann, and the other headed by inspector general (IG Amritsar border range) SPS Parmar. The Mann-led SIT investigated the cases registered in Tarn Taran. Earlier, during the case hearing, Joshi’s counsel AK Vermani said his client was falsely implicated in the case. It was Joshi’s second bail application. Earlier, his first bail plea was rejected by court considering “seriousness” of the case. Dozens of people had also lost vision after consuming the spurious illicit liquor in Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur and Amritsar districts in July and August last year. Nearly 100 of the total deaths were reported in Tarn Taran district alone. A case under sections 302 (murder), 304 (death by negligence), 307 (attempt to murder), 328 (hurt by poison), 326 (grievous hurt), 272 (adulteration), 109 (abetment), 114 (abettor), 201 (disappearing evidence) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code, and sections of the Excise Act was registered at the Tarn Taran police station initially. Joshi and some other persons were named in the case later on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2020-hooch-deaths-accused-ludhiana-businessman-gets-bail-for-want-of-evidence-101628624965009.html
11-08-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab’s first floating restaurant at Sirhind in deep waters||Once considered a landmark on the Amritsar-Delhi highway, Punjab’s first floating restaurant at Sirhind in Fatehgarh Sahib district is in a shambles with no proper approach road. Due to its uniqueness, the eight-room eatery in the middle of the Bhakra mainline canal hit the headlines in the 1970s and went on to become a place of attraction among commuters and tourists alike. Not only this, the restaurant run by the Punjab tourism department was once a stopover of buses running between India and Pakistan. But with the widening of the national highway and high twin-bridges on the canal, the restaurant lost its approach road and is no more visible from the main road. The idea of building the floating steel structure was conceived by architects Jeet Malhotra and Amar Rajinder Singh of the state department of architecture in 1971. Completed in 1972, the structure with a vaulted roof rests on a wooden deck which floats on five cylinders tied together. The deck served as an extension of an indoor seating area and is bridged to both canal banks. It was inaugurated by the then chief minister Zail Singh and remained his favourite stopover when he travelled on the highway. Also, many successive CMs would stop at the eatery.“Had there been little coordination between the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and the Punjab government, this five-decade-old masterpiece would not have lost its charm. The helplessness of the state tourism department is evident because this complex has been shut completely,” said Surinder Bahga, an architect and former chairman of Indian Institute of Architects.Sanjay Bansal, an industrialist from Sirhind, said “Due to a lackadaisical approach of the authorities concerned, the tourist attraction has been left to decay. The state government should at least preserve such structure for their heritage value.” Public works department (PWD) superintending engineer Parvinderjit Singh said matter he will take it up the matter with the NHAI to ensure passage for this architectural marvel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabs-first-floating-restaurant-at-sirhind-in-deep-waters-101628624963988.html
11-08-2021||Mumbai||Thane civic body starts door-to-door vaccination drive||Ten days after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) too has started door-to-door vaccination drive. The civic body has formed a team which will visit those who are bed-ridden once a week across the city and vaccinate them based on the registration. The civic body has published the link for registration to avail the facility on their social media pages and the official website.“We have started this special drive to vaccinate those who are bedridden due to long illnesses or any physical disability. A team of three, including a vaccinator, medical officer and data operator, will visit those who have registered and administer jabs across Thane city,” said TMC chief Dr Vipin Sharma. TMC has already started several special vaccination drives to reach out to the destitute, mental hospital residents and jail inmates. It also has four mobile vaccination vehicles that are stationed at different parts of the city to vaccinate as many as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-civic-body-starts-door-to-door-vaccination-drive-101628624544799.html
11-08-2021||Mumbai||Only 18% in Mumbai Metropolitan Region are fully vaccinated||While the state government has announced to allow fully vaccinated people to travel in local trains from August 15, the percentage of people who have received both the doses stands at 3.1 million or around 18% of the 17 million targeted citizens in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) — a significant number of whom use the Mumbai suburban train service. The cities in MMR are governed by nine municipal corporations and nine municipal councils and account for around 24 million citizens. Of the total population, 17 million are aged above 18 are and are eligible for vaccination. Mumbai has vaccinated its 1.99 million citizens with both the doses against targeted population of 9 million, while in Thane, Raigad and Palghar the number stands at 766,501; 219,904 and 197,592, respectively. In cities like Thane, Mira Bhayander and Kalyan-Dombivli the percentage of fully vaccinated citizens are 11%, 15% and 16%, respectively. In smaller cities and rural parts, the number hovers between 6% and 9%. “Unlike Mumbai, we have vaccination centres at scattered locations and the number of private facilities is also less. We hope to get more doses this month,” said Dr Manish Renge, district health officer of Thane.Renge, added, “Until June, we had regular supply of vaccine doses — twice or sometimes thrice a week. However, nowadays we receive doses only once a week. After we distribute those doses, we have to suspend vaccination drives until we get more from the state. AS there is no fixed number of vaccine doses that we receive from the state, we are unable to plan in advance. We distribute the doses immediately to ensure everyone has access to it.”Barring Mumbai, other cities in MMR are lagging behind in fully vaccinating citizens. “The availability of vaccine doses is the major problem before the municipal corporations in MMR. The state should have provided more doses in the cities in MMR as the mobility is more in MMR because of the high rate of urbanisation and industrial activities. On the contrary, some rural districts have been given more doses, disproportionate to their vaccination rate,” said an official from state’s relief and rehabilitation department.An officer from the health department, however, said it was a strategic move to open up local trains in graded manner. “Before the Covid-19 outbreak, the daily footfall in locals was around 7 million, which has come down to 1.9 million currently. By allowing fully vaccinated people, 1.5 million more citizens will now be allowed from August 15 and it will be a manageable number of commuters. During the first wave, categories of commuters were added gradually to allow them to travel. But this time, we have linked permission with vaccination to make it simpler. On the other hand, it will also work as a trigger for people to rush to get vaccinated,” he said.“It is a wise decision as the number of commuters expected to travel will not be more than 1.8 million, as 40% of 3.4 million are either senior citizens or travel in their own cars. This will also help the government give a push to the vaccination drive as many people, who were still not coming forward for vaccination, will come now. At the same time, the government should ensure that commuters follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. The state and Central governments should ensure that the vaccines doses, at least in MMR, are increased by three times more,” said Dr Avinash Bhondve, Maharashtra president of Indian Medical Association.Thane district, which comprise of six municipal corporations and two municipal councils, has been facing a shortage of vaccines since almost a month, on many occasions the vaccination drive has been suspended due to the unavailability of vaccines. The total number of vaccines received from the state is divided across the district based on the population. According to district health department officials, every time they receive doses, they ensure equal distribution. For example, if the total population of the district is 1 crore and a particular corporation has 2 million citizens while another taluka has 5 lakh citizens, then 20% of the received doses is given to that corporation and 5% to the taluka.“We have the capacity to administer 21,000 doses per day, against which we get around 12,000 doses weekly. The doses we get from the state are equally distributed in rural and urban areas. There was an initial hesitancy to get the shot among tribals, but awareness drives have helped in increasing the percentage,” said Dayanand Suryawanshi, district health officer, Palghar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/only-18-in-mumbai-metropolitan-region-are-fully-vaccinated-101628624303660.html
11-08-2021||Mumbai||FYJC CET cancelled: Maharashtra students now worried about higher cut-offs||While the Bombay high court’s quashing of the common entrance test (CET) for first-year junior college (FYJC) admissions ended months of anxiety, lakhs of students are now worried about the high cut-offs for Class 11 seats, as the admissions will now be conducted on the basis of Class 10 marks. Online registrations for FYJC admissions will commence from August 16. This year, Class 10 board exams across several school education boards had to be scrapped due to rising Covid-19 cases. Results for the Class 10 batch were instead based on students’ performance in Classes 9 and 10. This decision helped boost marks of students across school education boards. While the overall success rate of Secondary School Certificate (SSC) students was 99.5% this year, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) students in Maharashtra and Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) students from Pune region (which includes Mumbai) boasted of a 100% success rate. The high success rate meant a rise in the number of students scoring 90% and above. Many ICSE and CBSE schools witnessed 50% or more of their batches scoring 90% and above. Similarly, figures made public by the Maharashtra state board revealed that in SSC, 104,633 students received more than 90% marks and 957 (including 32 in Mumbai division alone) got 100% this year.“Every other student seems to have scored 90-95% in their boards, which will reflect in FYJC admissions merit lists. There is a good chance the first and second list across top colleges will end at 90% or above,” said Marie Fernandes, principal, of St Andrew’s College, Bandra.Considering no exam was held for Class 10, the government decided to conduct a CET, based only on the state board syllabus, in order to bring students from all boards on the same platform for FYJC admissions. While the exam was optional, the state minister for school education had clarified that in the first common merit list, priority will be given to those students who take the CET. Nearly 11 lakh students had already registered for the exam, which was scheduled to be conducted in physical mode on August 21. “When exams around the country have been called off considering the pandemic, the Maharashtra government’s decision to conduct an exam for 11 lakh students was wrong. We are beyond thrilled that the judiciary understood our plight,” said Tanisha Rai, an ICSE student. “The problem was also that it was to be based on state board syllabus. My daughter dropped science as a subject in Classes 9 and 10 and then suddenly, the government was expecting students like her to study such a subject in less than a month to appear for the CET,” said Adar Daruwala, parent of an ICSE student. “For a change, not just students from other boards, but even SSC students have scored very well this year. We were not sure if we would have the choice to skip the CET, especially after our results, because no one wanted to miss the chance to bag a seat in coveted colleges,” said Anusha Karwar, an SSC student from Balmohan Vidyamandir, Dadar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fyjc-cet-cancelled-maharashtra-students-now-worried-about-higher-cutoffs-101628624183489.html
11-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: No anticipatory bail for Raj Kundra in another case filed by Maharashtra cyber police in Nov||In a setback for businessman Raj Kundra, the sessions court on Tuesday rejected his anticipatory bail application (ABA) in a case registered by Maharashtra cyber police in November last year for allegedly showing obscene content on some over-the-top (OTT) platforms. Kundra’s counsel Sunil Kumar Sharma and Vinayak Tare argued on Tuesday that as there was already a case registered against him for showing obscene content on his Hotshots app, he can’t be arrested for a similar offence again. The court, however, rejected his ABA. Public prosecutor Shankar Erande, who appeared for the Maharashtra cyber police, strongly objected to the ABA. Last year, the Maharashtra cyber police had booked the director or owners of various OTT platforms and websites for allegedly showing obscene content. The FIR was registered by a retired customs officer who had named several OTT platforms in his complaint. Actress Sherlyn Chopra had also recorded her statement in the matter. In a separate case relating to Kundra’s bail plea in a crime branch case, in which he is currently in judicial custody, the hearing will be held on August 20. The police on Tuesday submitted their application opposing Kundra’s bail on various grounds, including threatening complainants. The police said they had seized 72 hard disks, three SAN boxes and eight servers from Kundra’s office and found that till now Hotshots had showed around 51 obscene videos. The court is likely to hear the arguments on the next date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-no-anticipatory-bail-for-raj-kundra-in-another-case-filed-by-maharashtra-cyber-police-in-nov-101628624003674.html
11-08-2021||Mumbai||Canada extends ban on flights from India till September 21||Students flying to Canada for studies were disappointed as the Canadian government on Monday (Canada time) extended flight ban till September 21. The ban was earlier valid till August 21.Indians wishing to fly abroad have been facing hurdles with several European and Western countries imposing a ban on flights originating from India. During the second wave of Covid-19, the country saw a rapid spread of the virus, leading to several countries deciding on flight bans. Canada has extended its ban on direct passenger flights from India until September 21 amid the South Asian country’s enduring struggles to contain the spread of Covid-19 within its borders, Transport Canada said. “Based on the latest public health advice from the Public Health Agency of Canada, Transport Canada is extending the Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) that restricts all direct commercial and private passenger flights to Canada from India until September 21, 2021, at 23:59 EDT,” the department said in a statement. The ban was first imposed on April 22 and has already been rolled over several times. It is the fifth time the ban has been extended.Rahul Singh, a Kandivali resident whose son has to fly to Toronto to complete his final year in Bachelor of Computer Science from Rayson University, said, “My son came to India due to the pandemic. He has to go back for his final year. However, we are struggling to find a way out to send him back. With this extension of ban, things will be more difficult as we don’t have more options and travelling by Mexico is costing nothing less than ₹. 2.25 lakh. The government needs to help students and save their educational year.”Jay Bhatia, managing director of Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI), said the number of flights and seat capacity is limited due to the ban on commercial flight operation restrictions by the ministry of civil aviation (MoCA), hence prices are high. “Further this is due to the increase in demand and less supply,” said Bhatia.Travel fare for students heading to UK or US is not as high as Canada. For instance, Mumbai to London one-way economy fare for direct flight on Virgin Atlantic for August end is around ₹1.19 lakh. “If we buy a ticket for December third week and return, economy class airfare is ₹124,000. Mumbai to New York one-way economy fares on Virgin Atlantic for August is around ₹83,000, and return in December third week, return economy class fare is ₹88,000,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/canada-extends-ban-on-flights-from-india-till-september-21-101628623943576.html

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) eased relaxations in the city on August 2, allowing essential and non-essential shops and establishments to remain open till 10pm while hotels and restaurants are allowed to remain open till 4pm. All indoor and outdoor sports activities apart from swimming have also been allowed. Following this, the suburban railway network has witnessed an increase in number of passengers.

11-08-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC: ‘Why have replies to petitions challenging IT rules not been filed?’||Expressing surprise at the Centre for not filing replies in any of the petitions filed across various courts in the country challenging the new IT Rules announced by the Ministry of Electronics and Information and Technology in February and implemented in May 2021, the Bombay high court has asked the Centre to file a reply as to why it should not pass interim orders on the petitions.The directions were prompted after the petitioners, which include a senior journalist and a digital news portal, submitted that they were living in fear of the rules and hence its operation should be stayed till the court passed its verdict in their petitions. The court has asked the Centre to file the affidavit by Friday. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni while hearing the petition filed by senior journalist Nikhil Wagle and digital news portal The Leaflet was informed by senior advocate Darius Khambatta and advocate Abhay Nevagi that the new rules were draconian and gave unbridled access to the privacy of individuals which was against the rights granted to citizens by the Constitution. On Monday, additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the Union of India informed the bench that the Supreme Court would be hearing an application seeking transfer of the two petitions to the apex court hence the bench should not proceed. However on Tuesday, Singh informed the court that the SC had not taken up hearing of the application. The bench then referred to the prayer of the petitioners to grant interim stay on the operation of the Rules and sought to know from them as to what would be their stand if their prayer was granted. “If the Rules are held up in the final writ petition and the writ fails subsequently, you cannot use our stay as a shield. During the period of the stay, you must continue to engage in activities with a sword hanging over your head,” remarked the bench. When the court sought to know from the parties whether a workable solution on the issue was possible if the rules were stayed, the petitioners submitted that they would continue to function as they functioned prior to the introduction of the Rules and would be liable for action in the event of breaching the laws that were prevalent prior to the Rules. However, ASG Singh requested the court not to pass any interim orders as the Centre’s reply was almost ready and would be filed by Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-why-have-replies-to-petitions-challenging-it-rules-not-been-filed-101628623765060.html

11-08-2021||Mumbai||WhatsApp hacker dupes Mumbai doctor of ₹1.50L||A 75-year-old doctor from Mulund is the latest victim of cyber fraudsters that operate through hacking WhatsApp. The fraudsters hacked the WhatsApp of the doctor’s friend in Bahrain and sent him message for urgent financial help due to a medical emergency.”On July 30 when I was checking patients at a Mulund hospital, I received a missed call on my phone from a friend, also a doctor who lives in Bahrain. When I tried calling back I couldn’t get through his phone number. Later I received WhatsApp message from his number, saying he was stuck in an important meeting and needed his help for a money transaction. He asked me to send ₹1.50 lakh to a person in India on his behalf for a medical emergency. My friend said that once his meeting was over he would send me the money. He also sent me the photo of the Indian patient in the operation theatre,” the complainant doctor stated in the FIR. The Mulund doctor responded to the message and immediately transferred the amount. Two hours later when he contacted his friend in Bahrain, he found that his friend never sent the WhatsApp messages to him. It turned out that the money was transferred to Meghalaya-based bank accounts and was withdrawn immediately. Police suspect that the cyber fraud groups that dupe people by WhatsApp hacking method are reactivating again. “Two-three years ago several such cases were reported to police. It seems, now they are back in action. These fraud groups generally target Indians having friends and relatives abroad,” a senior officer said.The Navghar police registered an FIR on Saturday. Cyber expert Ritesh Bhatia said a hacker starts WhatsApp on his/her device with the target person’s mobile number and then contacts the person posing as WhatsApp company representative informing the person there is an hacking attempt on his/her WhatsApp account. The hacker further says that in order to secure the account the user needs to share a code with them which has been sent by the server on the user’s number, using which the hacker gains control of the account. Another expert Vicky Shah said, “People must activate two step verification or two-factor authentication on not just on WhatsApp, but on all other social media accounts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/whatsapp-hacker-dupes-mumbai-doctor-of-rs-150l-101628623643649.html

11-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra drops ‘inactive member’ clause for housing society polls||The Maharashtra government has dropped the provision of “inactive member” who were barred from casting votes and contesting housing society elections. This was in reference to the amendment carried out in 2018 where the government mandated that any member who has not attended five consecutive general body (GB) meetings be declared “inactive member”. Recently, the Maharashtra law and Judiciary department has carried out amendment in section 26 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960. It said that “in respect of the elections of societies to be conducted on or before 31st March 2022, all the members of the society shall be eligible for voting unless otherwise ineligible for voting”. This new order has been welcomed by housing activists on the grounds that attending GB meetings is voluntary and should not become a yardstick of members being declared inactive. “If citizens are allowed to contest as well as cast votes in our parliamentary democracy irrespective of their record of public service or their history of taking part in voting, then why is there discrimination with housing society members,” asked advocate Vinod Sampat, who deals in real estate cases. Similar is the contention of Ramesh Prabhu, chairman of Maharashtra Societies Welfare Association (MSWA) who said, “Societies are taking the same maintenance amount from all members irrespective of their participation in GB meetings. Then all should be allowed to exercise their franchise in the society elections.” Housing activists said since all members contribute to the maintenance of the building, it was unfair to debar them. Housing society elections across the state have not been held since the past two years owing to new rules being framed and the Covid-19 pandemic. The government has now given extension to the current managing committee to continue till August 31. Housing societies, too, welcomed scrapping of the clause. “Many members tend to avoid attending GB meetings as there are fights, and they do not want to take part in such untoward incidents. However, depriving them of voting or taking part in elections was a wrong step which has now been rectified by the government,” said Dhaval Shah, chairman of Lokhandwala-Oshiwara Citizens’ Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-drops-inactive-member-clause-for-housing-society-polls-101628623403527.html
11-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai schools prepare for reopening after relaxation of curbs||With a week to go for city schools to reopen for middle and senior students, school managements are prepping campuses even as parents’ associations seem unwilling to send their children back to school in the midst of a pandemic. The state on Tuesday issued a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) which stipulated that schools are not allowed to seat more than 20 students in a classroom, one student per bench, with at least six feet distance between benches, among other things. The state empowered civic bodies to take a decision on the reopening of physical classes based on the existing Covid-19 pandemic situation in their city. State education minister Varsha Gaikwad last week announced that physical classes for Standard 8 to 12 in cities and Standard 5 to 8 in rural areas will resume on August 17. Across Mumbai and Thane, schools are putting protocols in place to ensure that if students return, proper Covid-19 behaviour is adhered to. While some schools are keen on distributing the students across classrooms and webcast a class, others want to stagger attendance and use a hybrid model of teaching. Others have begun to sanitise the campus and install mask disposal bins as well as temperature checks at entry points. Still others are mulling over assigning one desk to each child for the rest of the semester. “In international boards, classes 10, 11 and 12 are board exams and already these students have suffered because of missing school and practical classes for one academic year. Our schools have not more than 25-30 students per class plus we have the infrastructure to ensure students follow social distancing protocols while in school,” said Kavita Aggarwal, chairperson of Mumbai International Schools’ Association (MISA) and director of D G Khaitan School, Malad. The headmistress of a school which follows the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that the school would divide the students into separate classrooms. “We’ll use smart classrooms to ensure that whatever is being taught by a teacher in one classroom will be transmitted to the other classrooms as well at the same time. Live interaction will also be made possible to clear doubts from students, if any,” she said. “A robust health check mechanism for all staff and students has been put in place wherein all those entering the school premise will be thoroughly checked. Temperature will be screened and periodical self-health declaration before resumption and regularly thereafter will be done. We will re-open our schools in accordance with the regulations laid down by the state government,” said Jyotsna Mayadas Principal, Euro School in Thane. “Common areas in the school premises will have a distance marker or floor markings to ensure social distancing is maintained among students and staff at all times. Floor marking provisions have been made in the corridors and elevators as well. Moreover, mask disposal provisions have been made across the school premises with adequate posters and banners to reinforce safety procedures and policies,” she added. “We plan to divide the class in half with 50% attendance online and the rest in school; the concept of blended learning is in the pipeline so that none of the students miss out on classroom education. We plan to have only one child on each bench and mention their name on it as well making it a permanent seat; although sanitation will be carried out regularly,” said Ranjna Jangra, principal of B K Birla School, Kalyan. Not all schools, however, have the capacity to do so. State board schools, which have more students per class, face a shortage of teachers to implement such plans. “With online classes, 100-150 students can attend the class together and a teacher can pay attention to everyone but once physical classes begin with the social distancing norms in mind, we can’t have more than 25-30 students in one classroom. This means a teacher will have to go from one class to another to teach the same subject to students of the same batch,” said the principal of a state board school, who chose to remain anonymous. Meanwhile, parents’ groups are not keen to resume physical classes, especially in cities where Covid-19 numbers are still being recorded. Arundhati Chavan, president of Parent-Teachers Association United Forum said that the government should try pilot batches to understand the challenges posed by physical classes to schools and students. “Who will be responsible if one or more student contracts the virus?” she asked. Most schools HT spoke to said that they would take the cue from parents despite the presence of SOPs. Meanwhile, students are concerned that the change will come at the cost of a disturbance to their schedules. Spruha Londhe, 14, student of Delhi Public School, Nerul, said, “This is a very crucial academic year for me as I am in class 10; for the previous batch it was marks from the entire academic year that led to their final scores. So we have to ensure consistent performance throughout the year. If we have to shift between online and offline classes it will be difficult to adjust and maintain consistency in academics.” The headmistress of a Santacruz-based school which follows the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that the school would divide the students into separate classrooms. In November last year, the school education department had released a similar circular announcing re-opening of schools for classes 9 to 12 in a phased manner. By January 2021, another circular was released directing students from classes 5 to 8 be brought back to school in groups and maintain Covid appropriate behaviour on campus. Both these circulars, however, were revoked once Covid cases started rising again and the state government called for another complete lockdown starting mid-April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-schools-prepare-for-reopening-after-relaxation-of-curbs-101628623223573.html

Floods have wreaked havoc in Purvanchal and Bundelkhand regions of the state. Hundreds of villages are marooned, thousands of hectares of agricultural land is inundated. Cattle have fodder problems. Waterlogged villages are not getting any government help. Etawah, Jalaun, Auraiya, Prayagraj, Kaushambi, Hamirpur, Varanasi, Lakhimpur Kheri and a dozen more districts are flood-affected,” a statement issued by the Samajwadi Party quoted him as saying.Akhilesh also alleged that the UP government had failed to take any concrete steps and make strategy in the last four years to tackle floods. Before rain, all the money allocated for repair of bunds and relief work was lost to corruption, he further alleged.The former CM also asked his party cadre to work hard to provide relief to flood-affected people. “BJP government only talks about good days but when it comes to helping people in times of crisis, it vanishes”, Akhilesh alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/flood-scene-grim-in-up-relief-work-on-war-footing-needed-akhilesh-101628622684441.html

11-08-2021||Other||Male teachers decry posting of women counterparts in Government Inter Colleges in Prayagraj||: Recent transfer of women teachers in Boys’ Government Intermediate Colleges (GICs) across the state has not gone down well with their male counterparts. A large section of male teachers is objecting to these transfers, claiming the transfers are against government norms. Uttar Pradesh (UP) has 1,108 Government Intermediate Colleges (GICs) and 1,186 Government Girls Intermediate Colleges (GGICs). Recruitment of assistant teachers and lecturers for these institutions are done by the Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission (UPPSC). The male teachers said on July 13, eighteen women teachers were transferred to GIC–Prayagraj and this meant that there were 39 women teachers against 61 male teachers in the college. “These transfers are in violation of the set norms. There is no provision of having male teachers in GGICs and women teachers in GIC (Boys). However, the GIC-Prayagraj which is located in the heart of the city is a much-preferred choice of all and many women teachers have got posted there in violation of the guidelines,” claimed Rajnath Yadav, a senior male teacher at the college. “There were separate cadres of teachers for government boys’ and girls’ schools in the state. Appointments as well as seniority determination and promotion of the male and women teachers were done separately, the male teachers claimed. “Strangely, these women teachers have been posted here while applications of male teachers also vying for a transfer were overlooked. Five of the 18 women teachers transferred at GIC-Prayagraj have not even joined duty yet,” said Ramphal Bharti, another teacher of GIC-Prayagraj. “These transfers are in gross violation of set government guidelines. Our recruitment, cadre, transfers and seniority are all separate from the women teachers and even in the education directorate, different sections handle our affairs. Right at the time of recruitment, the advertisements clearly indicate the count of posts available in men’s and women’s branch of the colleges and while applying online, an applicant is required to choose the cadre according to their gender,” said Rameshwar Pandey, the state general secretary of Rajkiya Shikshak Sangh (Pandey faction).He said that at GIC-Prayagraj, the first female teacher was transferred in 2012 and since then this practice is continuing.“This year we are getting reports of women teachers being posted in GICs at most of the district headquarters including Lucknow, Bareilly, Meerut, Agra and Etawah. If this continues, all the posts of male teachers would get filled up by women teachers,” he maintained. Male teachers point out that the transfer of women teachers at GIC-Prayagraj is happening despite number of vacancies in many girls’ colleges.However, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma who is also the state’s secondary education minister had a different take on the issue.“Transferring women teachers in government intermediate colleges (GICs) is in practice for the past two years now. There were some vacancies in these schools and so we decided to post excess women teachers in those institutions where there was shortage of teachers,” he said.“Now, some GICs have also been opened to girl students and so we want women teachers there also. We wish to assure that no one would be affected through this move,” he added. BOXMale/Female teaching posts at GICs/GGICs in UP As per the UP Education Directorate records, there are a total of 9,028 posts of male assistant teachers (for teaching classes 6 to 10) and 4,356 posts of male lecturers (for teaching classes 11 and 12) at GICs. Out of the 4,356 posts of lecturers, 2,190 are filled by promotion of eligible assistant teachers while the remaining 2,066 are filled through recruitments. Similarly, there are a total of 9,366 post of female assistant teachers (for teaching classes 6 to 10) and 4,272 posts of female lecturers (for teaching classes 11 and 12) at GGICs. Out of the 4,272 posts of lecturers, around 50% are filled by promotion of eligible assistant teachers while the remaining 50% are filled through recruitments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/male-teachers-decry-posting-of-women-counterparts-in-government-inter-colleges-in-prayagraj-101628621783536.html

From November 2019 to February 2020, as many as 3,770 infants were admitted to PGI’s paediatrics ward. Of them, at least 173 were diagnosed with AVB. The infection was so severe in 14 of them, they succumbed to the infection. Also, 37% of the 173 infants required paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission and 15% required mechanical ventilation,” said Dr Suresh Kumar Angurana, assistant professor, department of paediatrics, PGIMER.Dr Suresh added, “From November 2020 to February 2021, only eight out of 1,589 infants were diagnosed with the infection. Also, none of the infants required PICU admission or mechanical ventilation. The mortality rate was also recorded as zero.”“During the lockdown, social gatherings and events were restricted and schools, day-care centres, crèches, playgrounds were also shut. Due to this social isolation, exposure to the outside environment decreased and cases of viral infection dropped significantly. Even when they were reported, severity was low,” added Dr Suresh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pgimer-study-respiratory-infection-among-infants-down-96-101628621485909.html

While the exercise, months ahead of the 2022 UP polls, would obviously help the BJP connect better with the villages which had witnessed widespread grief during the second Covid--19 wave in April and May, the health volunteers denied that the initiative had a political reason. “Our leaders made it clear that though the BJP had taken up the initiative to post health volunteers in villages, yet the exercise to train volunteers would not remain confined to the party. In fact, we would be willing to train other social organizations irrespective of the party affiliation,” said Indra Nigam, 34, an accountant and a BJP volunteer from Gorakhpur who took the lessons. He works with BJP’s IT team in the district. Some health volunteers, however, admitted that along with raising awareness about Covid safeguards, they would also popularise the various efforts made by the Narendra Modi government at the centre and the Yogi Adityanath government in UP, to help the poor through various schemes and initiatives. “We are BJP workers from districts so we will also talk about the party and government initiatives “ a health volunteer said. The idea of health volunteers to be posted in villages was first mooted by BJP general secretary (organization) BL Santhosh during his visit to the state capital in June. Back then, the move to deploy health volunteers was announced immediately after the extensive devastation caused during the second Coovid wave in April. The BJP also invited Dr Suryakant from King George’s Medical University’s (KGMU) department of pulmonary medicine to coach the doctors who too had come for the training session. “There were teams of nearly five or more people, including a doctor, from across the districts for the training session in Lucknow. Dr Suryakant interacted with the doctors as well as us. He stressed on the use of certain medicines, their dosage for various age groups and what can instantly be given,” said Sanjay Ram, a health volunteer from Gorakhpur. Each team which arrived from districts had a party person, a doctor from the district, an information technology person and a coordinator. “Now, these people would train volunteers. For instance, there are 1294 gram-panchayats in Gorakhpur region, and we will help train one male and one female volunteer in each of these panchayats,” he said. “God forbid if Covid strikes again, we will be ready with some essentials like medicines. In case someone is displaying symptoms, we will, based on the person’s condition, decide whether he/she requires home quarantine or needs to be shifted to the nearest primary health centre,” he added. It would be mandatory for the health volunteers to be vaccinated and create awareness about double dose vaccination too, the volunteers said. “We have been given the mantra of ‘mera booth, Covid mukt (my booth, Covid free)’. But we will work for creating a Covid-free environment not just at the booth-level but in society too,” one of them said. Details of all the sick, the volunteers said, would be fed into a portal and shared with the party and the government for proper monitoring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ahead-of-2022-up-polls-bjp-raising-2-lakh-village-health-volunteers-force-101628621483808.html
11-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Universal passes for local train travel at railway stations from today||Ahead of starting local train services for those fully vaccinated in Mumbai and Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) from August 15, the Maharashtra government on Tuesday declared to start issuing mandatory universal passes from Wednesday (August 11). The universal passes will make the commuters eligible to obtain monthly railway passes for travel as the state government has declared that daily tickets will not be issued.Universal passes embedded with a Quick Response (QR) code will be made available to the commuters through both offline and online. While the offline facility is starting from Wednesday, the online facility is expected to be launched in the next 24 to 48 hours after completing all the necessary testing. In the offline system, universal passes are going to be available at special help desks set up at railway stations by local civic bodies. Citizens can approach the nearest railway stations and get the universal passes after proper verification of their vaccination certificates.In Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is setting up 358 help desks at 53 railway stations that come in its jurisdiction for the verification process, the officials said. Across the MMR, help desks will be opened at 109 railway stations. Citizens who are fully vaccinated for Covid-19 and have completed 14 days since their second Covid-19 vaccine shot are eligible to travel in local trains and will be issued universal passes.“All the fully vaccinated persons wishing to avail the monthly season pass will first approach these help desks and show their fully vaccinated certificate along with a government issued photo ID (preferably Aadhar Card). They should carry a photocopy of the photo ID also for stamping purposes. After verifying the authenticity of the vaccination certificate by scanning the QR code followed by due diligence like matching of names on documents, dates of both doses, passage of minimum 14 days since second dose of vaccination etc., the person at the help desk shall put special stamp on certificate of vaccination submitted as well as on the photocopy of the I-Card. After this, the commuter can go to the railway ticket counter to obtain a monthly pass,” stated the standard operating procedure issued by the state revenue department on Tuesday.The commuters have been asked to carry all the three documents, while traveling i.e. universal pass, railway pass and photo identity card.The help desks will operate in two shifts — first between 7am to 3pm and second between 3pm and 11pm.The state government has asked the railways to ensure that all the ticket counters are opened and fully functional. It has also asked the BMC or other local bodies of MMR to set up enough number of help desks in view of the number of commuters that may require this service so that passes can be provided within reasonable time.“Once the online system for issuing the universal passes is operational, the eligible citizens will not be required to go to help desks at railways stations. They can obtain the universal passes through a portal developed by the state government and then can approach the railway counter directly to get a monthly pass,” said a senior official from the relief and rehabilitation department.The motive behind authenticating fully vaccinated persons through QR codes or verifying documents is to ensure that only fully vaccinated people would travel by local trains besides those who fall under essential services category. “We have got the API (Application Programming Interface) from the central government for the Cowin portal. We have also started the testing process, but it has to go through several rounds of security tests. We are trying to complete the procedure and make the portal ready in the next 24 to 48 hours,” said Aseem Gupta, principal secretary, relief and rehabilitation department.API testing is a type of software testing that aims to determine whether the APIs that are developed meet expectations when it comes to functionality, performance, reliability and security for an application.The portal developed by the state government will be linked with the Cowin portal for verification. Once the registration is done on the state government’s portal, the information will be verified using the API linked with Cowin and will be certified back to the state portal. The user will then get a link to take a selfie and upload back to the portal for the generation of the universal pass, the officials said.Commuters, who will obtain universal passes through the online system, will have to carry only two documents: universal pass and monthly railway pass.However, government employees, semi government employees, and essential service workers can continue to travel by local train irrespective of their vaccination statusAccording to data from BMC, a total of 1,914,771 beneficiaries have been fully vaccinated in Mumbai till date. Of these, 297,377 are healthcare and frontline workers; 646,939 are citizens above 60 years of age; 811,709 are citizens between the age group of 45 years and 59 years; 140,944 are citizens between the age group of 18 years and 44 years; 721 are lactating mothers; 8 are pregnant women; 16,889 are students or professionals looking to travel abroad, or those who were participating in Tokyo Olympics; 136 are physically or mentally differently abled beneficiaries; 26 are persons without identity proofs (prisoners/transgender persons); and 22 are bed ridden beneficiaries.While citizens who have not received both doses of their vaccine, or even a single dose of their vaccine will not be allowed to enter the railway premises at all, government and semi-government employees, and essential services workers can continue to travel by train, regardless of their vaccination status.In its statement on Tuesday, BMC said, “Citizens are requested not to crowd railway stations, as the helpdesks will be operational all seven days in the week. Strict legal action under the epidemic act will be taken against citizens, if fake vaccination certificates are found.”The statement was issued after a meeting between BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, railway authorities, and police authorities on Tuesday afternoon. Civic officers of the public health department, deputy municipal commissioners, and assistant municipal commissioners of all 24 administrative wards in the city were also present at the meeting.Nodal officers have been appointed at the railway station level for coordination between the railway authorities, civic authorities, and the police, a senior civic officer said. To avoid crowding at railway stations, the state government has directed the police to allow entry on railway stations only to those commuters having universal passes or vaccination certificates along with identity cards between August 15 and 31. After which police may decide on random checks or other means to ensure that only authorised travellers are moving in the railway station, states the order.The railways have decided to open 617 railway ticket window counters for passengers that will issue monthly passes on the central and western railway. Of them, 341 windows will be functional on central railway stations and the rest 276 ticket windows on western railway stations, a railway official said.Both the zonal railways have provided the number of entry and exit points of every suburban railway station to the state police force and all entry and exit points will be manned by security personnel 24/7. Special squad teams will be formed by the railway authorities to check tickets and vaccination certificates inside local trains, he said.The state government as well as the zonal railways are also considering to issue quarterly and yearly railway passes to the commuters from September.The railways have decided not to increase the number of train services immediately. “We will increase the number of train services after there is a rise in the number of passengers. We will then operate local trains in 100 percent capacity.” said a CR official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-universal-passes-for-local-train-travel-at-railway-stations-from-today-101628621364743.html
11-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Dadumajra dump site nowhere near being cleared||Well past its original deadline, the legacy waste mining project at the Dadumajra dump site is progressing at a snail’s pace with more than 60% garbage yet to be removed.Moreover, the municipal corporation (MC) officials have also conceded that the work is unlikely to be completed this year.The ₹33-crore project was launched with much fanfare in December 2019 by UT administrator VP Singh Badnore in the presence of MP Kirron Kher.Under this project, around 5 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of waste, which had been lying at the spot for more than 20 years (till 2005), was to be bio-mined and processed through scientific procedures, and the entire land of about 25 acres was to be reclaimed for future use for scientific waste treatment and disposal.At the inauguration ceremony, officials had stated all the 5 lakh MT waste would be cleared within 18 months. On the ground, however, the work has even failed to meet the extended deadline, which the MC had allowed in the wake of the pandemic.Even UT adviser Dharam Pal has maintained that removal of legacy waste and sanitation was one of his priorities. The daily generation of solid waste in the city is around 550-600 MT, but only 70-80 MT waste is processed every day.New deadline uncertainMC commissioner KK Yadav said, “Of the total 5 lakh MT legacy waste at the site, more than 2 lakh MT has been removed. We expect the work to be completed by March-end next year.” A number of reasons have been put forward by the MC officials for the slow pace of work. but largely the pandemic has been blamed for the missed deadlines. Now, the officials are blaming the monsoon: “The garbage becomes too moist to be removed during rains. So work has been slowed down for the last 10 days,” said an MC official, who didn’t wish to be named. In winters too, the work will be suspended. “The work is likely to pick pace only next year after winter ends. We expect it to be finished by the third quarter next year,” added the official. Officials are now contemplating imposing a fine on the firm undertaking the work. “A penalty would be imposed on the firm if the work is further delayed as per the contract,” said Yadav. Project doesn’t cover removal of 4.5 lakh MT wasteThe legacy waste mining project doesn’t cover another 4.5 lakh MT of waste that was dumped at Dadumajra site after 2005.The MC is expecting to finance removal of additional 1 lakh MT through central funds under the Swachh Bharat Mission. No timeline has been set for its removal, and the proposal is only for removing 20% of the post-2005 legacy waste.Dyal Krishan, president of the Dumping Ground Joint Action Committee, said, “For the last 25 days, no work has been going on at the site. As per our estimates, no more than 20% of work has been completed so far.”Stating that categorising the waste into pre-2005 and post-2005 hasn’t solved the residents’ problems, Krishan said, “The garbage mound is only getting bigger every day. They work on one site but dump more on the adjacent site. In December 2019 we were told the site would be cleared, but it was an eye-wash.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-dadumajra-dump-site-nowhere-near-being-cleared-101628621363680.html

Earlier, water from open drains used to spill on to the roads and into the pond, which not just polluted the water and emitted foul smell but also posed a health hazard by serving as a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other insects.”Besides treating the water flowing into the pond, desilting was also carried out, which increased the storage capacity of the pond to 65 lakh litres.The village, which has a population of 817 individuals residing in 147 households, generates approximately 1.12 lakh litres of wastewater a day. This water is treated and stored in the pond, which is then used to irrigate up to 18 acres a month. Earlier, two tube wells were required to do the same.As part of the project, the area around the pond was also cleaned and renovated. A few benches were also set up for residents to come and sit in their leisure time. “This project has changed the face of the village. People from nearby villages come here to see this technology,” said Sukhraj Singh, a village resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/wastewater-treatment-helps-gurdaspur-village-turn-dirty-pond-into-source-of-irrigation-101628621123365.html
11-08-2021||Mumbai||Tread cautiously, say experts as Mumbai opens up ahead of predicted third wave||Lockdown relaxations in Mumbai are coinciding with the anticipated third wave predicted to hit the city around mid-August to September. With extension in timings for commercial shops, opening of offices, discussions over opening malls and the upcoming festival season, the possibility of accelerating the third wave cannot be denied. While reviving the economy of the financial capital is crucial, experts said the administration should tread cautiously and be prepared to introduce quick micro-containment measures through robust monitoring of cases. Epidemiologists estimate that there is typically a 100 to 120-day gap between peaks of two waves. In Mumbai, the peak of the second wave was recorded in April. While the peaks have varied in cities and states, most experts predict that India’s third wave may come anytime between August and December. “These predictions are subject to assumptions,” said Soumitra Ghosh, associate professor at the Centre for Health Policy, Planning and Management, Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS). “But we have to be extremely cautious, assess the situation on a daily basis and put all efforts in vaccinating citizens,” he said. Multiple factors come into play for a surge in any outbreak. These include probability of contact between individuals, number of susceptible people, and infectiousness of the agent among other things. “Will the lockdown relaxations lead to an increase in the number of cases? The answer is definitely yes,” said Jacob John, professor at the department of community health, Christian Medical College, Vellore. “But will it lead to a wave? This is unlikely, unless a new variant starts spreading rapidly,” he said. The second wave was predominantly driven by the Delta variant. A mutation of Delta known as AY.1 or Delta Plus is already in circulation. Experts estimate that at least one-third of Mumbai’s population is unexposed to the virus by natural infection or is unvaccinated. This susceptibility is a perfect ground for a surge as well as for new variants to emerge. “Cities will have to open up at some point in time, but authorities have to be very sensible about the process. A lot of thought has to go into what kind of activities need to open up so that the marginal population does not suffer more. Also, the risk has to be balanced with immunisation,” said John. Nearly 9 million people aged above 18 years are eligible for vaccination in Mumbai. The city has administered over 7.6 million doses, but only about 1.9 million people or 21% of the eligible population has been fully vaccinated so far. Epidemiologist and health systems expert Dr Chandrakant Lahariya said it is important for activities to resume, but in a calibrated manner. “If malls open up, there can be a limit on the number of people who are allowed inside at a given point of time. If people in certain market areas or shops are flouting Covid-19 norms or masking and distancing, they should be locked down. Cities will have to adopt a dynamic, granular approach towards containment and lockdown measures,” said Lahariya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/tread-cautiously-say-experts-as-mumbai-opens-up-ahead-of-predicted-third-wave-101628621064371.html
11-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Public bicycle sharing to kick off on Aug 12||The first phase of the public bicycle sharing project is all set to start from Thursday. UT administrator VP Singh Badnore will launch it from Shanti Kunj in Sector 16. As many as 1,250 bicycles, including pedal-assisted e-bikes, will be available at 155 docking stations. Around 225 bicycles are already available following the city’s participation in the Union government sponsored Cycle4Change competition. After it ended in May, they were continued to be made available to the public for free.Now, users will have to pay ₹10 per half an hour. Those availing of annual membership at ₹500 will have to pay ₹5 per half an hour. They will be able to borrow the bikes by registering on the ‘Smart Bike’ app. All of them are GPS-enabled and will be monitored from a command-and-control centre with 24x7 helpline facility.Around nine cycles will be kept at every station. The major ones include Rock Garden, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Sukhna Lake, PGI and Sectors 17, 22, 34, 35 and 43.The project is being developed in four phases of 1,250 cycles and 155 docking stations each. The ultimate target is to make available 5,000 cycles with a network of 617 stations.App for tracking garbage collection vehicles to be launchedBadnore will on Thursday also launch a mobile app to track door-to-door garbage collection trucks. A solid waste management vehicle tracking and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) facility will also be made operational.The project has come up at a cost of around ₹5.8 crore. Through SCADA, MC officials will be able to live monitor and track the movement and activity of the trucks on their monitor screens.The system will let the officials know in real-time when the vehicle become stationary, for how long and for what reasons. In case the delay is because of the households, the system will allow garbage collectors to report it. They will also be able to register complaints against households who don’t give segregated garbage. The mileage will also be monitored.The administrator will also launch the SCADA for the tertiary water supply, which is expected to improve the supply and minimise wastage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhpublic-bicycle-sharing-to-kick-off-on-aug-12-101628620946962.html

11-08-2021||Delhi||DCPCR starts reading campaign to improve literacy levels in childcare institutes||The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) on Tuesday started a “reading campaign” in child care institutes (CCIs) across the national capital with an aim to enhance the foundational literacy and numeracy skills of children residing there.According to a statement issued by the commission, it had conducted a baseline assessment of all the children residing in CCIs in Delhi. “It was found that 52% of children were able to read words in Hindi and 55% of students were able to identify two-digit numbers. This poor learning level in CCI is the same as the dismal learning levels across states in India. Approximately 70% government school children are unable to read a Grade III level text (ASER Report, 2020). Hence, a dedicated intervention to strengthen the learning levels of children in CCIs was launched,” the statement read.There are 101 CCIs across Delhi housing child victims of trafficking, sexual violence, parental incarceration, parental death and child labour.DCPCR chairperson Anurag Kundu said a dedicated team, consisting members of the commission, district child protection officers, members of child welfare committees in Delhi, mentor teachers from the Directorate of Education (DoE), volunteers and members of NGO Pratham, will work on the project.Kundu said the project is in line with the Delhi government’s flagship “Mission Buniyaad” project launched in city public schools in 2018 to improve learning levels among students. “Every day the team members will conduct reading campaigns in CCIs for two-three hours under this project. The idea is to improve the learning levels of children residing in CCIs... For example, if a child cannot read a sentence or a paragraph or doesn’t even know the alphabets, he or she will be taught from that level. This methodology is known as ‘teaching at the right level’,” he said.The campaign will continue until November 14 which is celebrated as the children’s day every year. “The goal is to ensure 100% children are able to read Hindi fluently with comprehension and perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, by this November,” Kundu added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dcpcr-begins-reading-campaign-to-improve-literacy-levels-in-childcare-institutes-in-delhi-101628620886600.html
11-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi enters its second break monsoon phase, no rain likely till Aug 16: IMD||On Tuesday, Delhi and parts of the National Capital Region (NCR) entered the “break monsoon” phase, which will result in a dry spell till at least August 16. This, according to weather forecasters, will also lead to a rise in temperature in the coming days.Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said from Tuesday afternoon, the break monsoon conditions set in over Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, south-west Uttar Pradesh, west Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, as winds blowing over the region changed course from the humid easterlies to the dry westerlies. Such conditions are likely to continue till at least August 16, forecasters said.“The monsoon trough has moved north, towards the Himalayan foothills. During this period, parts of north-west and central India will mostly remain dry, till the trough starts moving south again,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.According to weather experts, a break monsoon is a phase of the south-west monsoon, when there is a stoppage in the monsoon rain. This pause could last a couple of days or even extend for a fortnight.The break monsoon phase is characterised by a northwards shift of the monsoon trough, closer to the foothills of the Himalayas, leading to a decrease in rainfall in many parts of the country. While rainfall decreases in parts of north, north-west and central India, this phenomenon also results in increased rainfall along the Himalayan foothills, in north-east India and also the southern peninsula.Weather experts said while break monsoon conditions are common in north-west India in July and August, what is rare this time is the fact that this is the second break monsoon phase in Delhi. The first one hit the national capital even before the onset of monsoon this year.“Break monsoon conditions are not uncommon in this region in the month of August, but this time we saw a break in June itself, even before the south-west monsoon arrived. That is a rare event, but not completely unheard of,” said a senior Met official, asking not to be named.The official explained that in June, at the time of its onset, and in September when it starts receding, monsoon usually does not go into a break phase. It is in July and August, which are the rainiest months, when such conditions are generally seen, he said.Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet Weather Services, a private weather forecasting agency, also agreed that break monsoon conditions in the months of July and August could extend up to 10-15 days. He also said this break from rains could also impact the overall rainfall that Delhi receives this month.“This August, even before the city entered the break phase, we did not see a lot of rainfall as compared to what we saw in July. It is difficult to say at this time if this break condition will impact the cumulative rainfall of the month. But for heavy rain to revive, there needs to be favourable weather conditions to support the trough shifting back southwards and, currently, there are no such signs,” Palawat said.IMD data shows that currently the Safdarjung weather station, taken as representative of the entire city, has a monthly rainfall deficit— it received 63.2mm rains as against a normal of 94.5mm, while Palam station recorded only 55.5mm rainfall against a monthly average of 100.8mm.Forecasters also said in the coming days, because of the change in wind direction, the temperature is likely to go up by a few degrees.“Since we are now getting dry westerly winds, the temperature will also start rising from tomorrow (Wednesday),” IMD forecast said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-enters-its-second-break-monsoon-phase-no-rain-likely-till-aug-16-says-imd-101628620887253.html
11-08-2021||Other||Punjab to emulate Haryana model of farmland record integration||Punjab has decided to go with the Haryana model of farmland record integration for paddy procurement under its new system, which will come into place from October.Mandi board secretary Ravi Bhagat said that three state departments: revenue, food and civil supplies and mandi board will work together on a common digital platform.The departments will integrate a database of an estimated 10 lakh farmers and cultivators in the next one-and-half months.“On examining various models, the one adopted by the Haryana government was found to be the most impressive. As per central government’s instructions, payment mode for this year’s major kharif crop –paddy-- will be through the land integrated system,” he added.Master trainers from mandi board department have been given practical training on the new software and field teams will start the exercise of compiling data from the next week.Allaying speculations, the official clarified that the new system has specific columns for landowners and cultivators. He also denied claims that government agencies have asked farmers to submit ‘farad’ or land records.“We do not require any land ownership documentation. Revenue department has digitised land details whereas the mandi board has details of ‘J’ forms obtained by farmers at the respective crop procurement centres. These details will be integrated for the food and supplies department (that is mandated for crop procurement) for direct payment to paddy growers,” said Bhagat.Unlike Haryana, Punjab has not planned satellite mapping of crops at this stage.“But the adopted system is sufficient to build data of acreage of crops in the state. In view of Punjab’s different dynamics where sizeable agriculture land is given on lease informally by NRIs, interests of farmers cultivating land on lease have been well protected in it,” added the mandi board secretary.Sources privy to the forthcoming system say field teams of different agencies may be engaged for fields inspections in suspected data cases.“Punjab has around 28,000 registered arhtiyas, who further have 20 to 200 farmers associated with them. Details with arthiyas can be cross-checked with the state’s land detail registry for confirmation,” says the official.Official sources said the step of integrating land records with food grain procurement will make the purchase system transparent. They added that the government intends to ensure that crop cultivated by farmers is procured as per policy with no scope for malpractices.“In the traditional open-ended purchase system, it is a known fact that huge quantities of paddy are purchased by unscrupulous traders, in connivance with officials, at lower prices from others states, and later sold to government agencies at MSP (minimum support price). With the integrated system in place, the agencies have prior information about farmers and cultivators and the estimated quantity of paddy or wheat they can produce, thus excess arrival of paddy can be spotted easily,” said a government functionary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-to-emulate-haryana-model-of-farmland-record-integration-101628620886118.html
11-08-2021||Delhi||DDA approves norms for multilevel parking on PPP mode||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on Tuesday approved the development control norms for multilevel car parking (MLCP) lots to come up on a public private partnership basis.DDA officials said the norms have defined the floor area ratio for multilevel parking facilities and have made it mandatory for agencies to get a traffic impact assessment (TIA) done and prepare a traffic management plan (TMP). The proposal was approved in a meeting chaired by lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal, who is also the chairman of DDA.According to the norms, the FAR for a multilevel parking on a 3,000 square metre plot is 100 whereas for a 6,000 square metre plot, it is 60. The new norms allow the private concessionaire to use the MLCP for commercial purposes to recover the cost of the project.A senior DDA official said, “The current modification has adopted a graded approach for apportionment of commercial FAR on plots and the FAR will vary depending on the plot size. The norms have introduced flexibility in provisioning of commercial FAR for specific size of plots provided the stipulated condition of TIA and TMP is fulfilled.”In the meeting, the DDA also approved a policy for allotment of CNG (compressed natural gas) station sites. The land-owning agency has approved the provision for e-auction of CNG stations. A senior DDA official said, “Earlier, the land was allotted for five years and an increase in rates was not fixed as it was related to the average auction rates. Under the new policy, the tenure of the licence is 10 years which is renewable up to 30 years and the increase in the licence fee is fixed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dda-approves-norms-for-multilevel-parking-on-ppp-mode-101628620885048.html
11-08-2021||Chandigarh||Indian Army is a force to reckon with: Haryana governor||Haryana governor Bandaru Dattatreya on Tuesday said that India in 2022 is not what it was in 1962, in reference to the Indo-China war that India lost. He was in Ambala Cantonment for the felicitation ceremony of 25 gallantry award winners, as part of the Kharga Corps Independence Day celebrations at Raina Auditorium. The winners include 10 former army men, 10 serving in the forces and five war widows/veer naris. “During the 1962 war, the nation was weaker, but now under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, several advancements have been made in the Indian Army. Now, if enemy forces attack, our army hits back harder. Even China has understood this and we have seen a demonstration at Galwan,” Dattatreya said.The governor added that the appointment of Bipin Rawat as Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) to coordinate between the three forces and four times compensation to families of martyrs are bold steps by the Union government. “Many advanced missile systems have been added in the Army’s fleet that will ensure that our forces are ready to face the enemy at anytime,” he said. On his arrival at Ambala Cantonment, he first paid homage to the War Heroes at Kharga War Memorial and also witnessed new generation weapons and equipment and lauded the efforts of the Armed Forces. During the ceremony, Lt General NS Raja Subramani, General Officer Commanding (GOC), Kharga Corps, said that as the nation celebrates its 75th anniversary of independence, the force is also observing its golden jubilee.  “It was raised during the liberation war in 1971. In 1975, Western Command was set up in Chandimandir and 10 years later, the Kharga Corps was established at Ambala Cantt ,” the GOC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/indian-army-is-a-force-to-reckon-with-haryana-governor-101628620883370.html
11-08-2021||Delhi||‘Schools ready to bridge learning gap’: Sisodia after meeting with principals||A day after the Delhi government issued guidelines for the partial reopening of schools in the capital, education minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday met the heads of several government schools and said that the schools are not only ready to bridge the learning gaps but also the emotional well-being of students when they return.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Sunday allowed students of classes 10, 11 and 12 to visit school for admissions and board exam-related work. Schools and colleges in the national capital have been closed since March last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Classes briefly resumed in a staggered manner between January and February before being suspended again due to the fourth wave of the pandemic in the Capital.While interacting with the principals of government schools in south-east Delhi district, Sisodia said, “The cases of Covid in Delhi have now been controlled to a great extent. During the special PTM, most of the parents agreed that schools should reopen because, in the last 1.5 years, there has been a lot of damage to the education of children. We have to bridge the loss of learning as well as cater to the mental and socio-emotional well-being of children. Our children and teachers have gone through a harrowing phase of Covid, we need to get them out of that phase.”“It is heartening to see that the heads of schools are ready to not only bridge the learning gap when schools open but also cater to social-emotional well-being when children return to school,” he said, directing the school heads to strictly follow the Covid appropriate guidelines.The education minister also sought suggestions from heads of schools regarding the reopening. Some principals suggesting measures to “reunite students with teaching-learning process again” during the first week, and few also recommended arranging professional counsellors for students.According to a statement issued by the government on Tuesday, the principals of government schools in the district were given a three-day training ahead of the reopening of schools. “Training is also being given on how to reduce the learning gap of the children once schools reopen and reconnect them with learning,” the statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/schools-ready-to-bridge-learning-gap-sisodia-after-meeting-with-principals-101628620823305.html
11-08-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC extends general stay on demolition, eviction, dispossession till August 30||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday extended the general stay on demolition, eviction and dispossession, granted last year in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and extended from time to time, till August 30.The court also clarified that as lockdown norms were relaxed to a large extent and courts across the state had started functioning physically, there will be no need to extend the general stay beyond August 30.HC had initiated a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) soon after nationwide lockdown was announced in March last year and restrained authorities from carrying out any proposed demolition of structures or eviction and dispossession of occupants due to the pandemic. The larger bench comprising chief justice Dipankar Datta, justice Amjad Sayed, justice SS Shinde and justice Prasanna Varale, while deciding whether to extend the order for interim protection passed last year, said as the situation had been normalised it was not inclined to extend it further. The bench observed that the protection was granted as courts were not functioning physically and people could not approach courts for reliefs. However, in light of the situation improving, there was no need to extend it any further. “The interim order is till August 13 and we will extend it one last time till August 30. So, whoever has been enjoying protection so far will get two weeks to approach courts now that restrictions are being lifted and we are also functioning physically,” said CJ Datta in the order. The court held that such interim protection was granted because of the crisis created by the pandemic and access to justice was not clear. “Now since the crisis is on the wane leading to easing of lockdown restrictions as well as lifting of Covid-appropriate behaviour protocol coupled with the fact that courts have started functioning as in pre-pandemic days, the situation which required interference of courts requiring protective interim orders is no longer required. However, public at large which believe they are being protected by the orders will be protected only till August 30 and not beyond that,” said the order. The court, however, kept the suo motu PIL pending in the event that such protective orders were required to be passed again in the near future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-extends-general-stay-on-demolition-eviction-dispossession-till-august-30-101628620763403.html
11-08-2021||Delhi||BJP leader among six arrested for anti-Muslim sloganeering at Jantar Mantar||Delhi Police on Tuesday arrested Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ashwini Upadhyay and five other people in connection with an event at Jantar Mantar two days ago where anti-Muslim slogans were allegedly shouted.Videos shot at Sunday’s event -- which organisers claimed was held to push for the abolition of “colonial-era laws” -- showed people shouting communal slogans, triggering outrage . After the videos went viral on social media, activists filed police complaints on Monday.Police said it didn’t grant permission to the event organised by Upadhyay under the banner of Bharat Jodo Andolan (Unite India movement). Upadhyay, a former Delhi BJP spokesperson, said no inflammatory slogans were raised on Sunday.Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav said that apart from Upadhyay, Preet Singh, Deepak Singh, Deepak Kumar, Vinod Sharma, and Vinit Bajpai were arrested.A senior police officer, who did not want to be named, said that the six were arrested following raids conducted at various locations in Delhi-NCR on Monday night.“All six have been booked on the alleged charges of promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc, and acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony, disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant, and defying Covid-19 guidelines laid by the Delhi disaster management authority (DDMA), said the officer, adding that the FIR was registered under Indian Penal Code’s sections 153 A and 188 and 51 of Disaster Management Act.Preet is the director of an organisation called “Save India Foundation” and is also among the organisers of the event. Deepak Singh and Vinod Sharma are learnt to be associated with two different right-wing organisations, the police said.Searches were being conducted on Tuesday to nab other people, who have been identified among those seen raising communal slogans in the video. Two of them were identified as Pinki Chaudhary, chief of Hindu Raksha Dal, and one Uttam Malik (whose affiliation with any organization is not known), another police officer said, requesting not to be named.The Hindu Raksha Dal is a fringe organised which had also purportedly claimed responsibility for the violence on JNU campus in January last year.In a video shown on a news channel, Pinki Chaudhary can be heard taking the responsibility of the incident and saying in Hindi, “…Hindu Raksha Dal takes the responsibility of it. I take the responsibility…people came to the venue through us…whoever were there (at the venue) were our people…If any youth have done something wrong, the government should pardon them because in such a crowd someone comes from somewhere and says something…” Chaudhary is saying in the video.HT cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video.“Six people have been arrested after an FIR was registered at the Connaught Place Police Station related to provocative sloganeering at a programme held near Bank of Baroda,” Yadav said.HT tried to contact Upadhyay on Tuesday but his phone was switched off.On Monday, the police registered a case against unknown persons under Indian Penal Code’s (IPC) sections 153A (promoting enmity) and 188 (disobedience to order). Relevant sections of the Disaster Management Act were also included in the case because Covid-19 guidelines such as social distancing and wearing masks were violated during the event, the police said.Upadhyay on Monday said that he has filed a written police complaint seeking an investigation to verify the authenticity of the videos and strict action against people spreading “religious frenzy”.Shipra Srivastava, media in-charge of Bharat Jodo Aandolan, said the protest was held to demand 222 British-era laws be abolished. “We have seen the video but have no idea who they are. The police should take strict action against the persons who raised the slogans,” she said on Monday.The sloganeering provoked outrage. In a tweet, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said: “What a disgrace to read of an unauthorised BJP demonstration where communal slogans & hate speech were voiced…Expecting exemplary action from @DelhiPolice – only stern action & condign punishment will prevent such misbehaviour recurring.”Delhi BJP refused to comment on the incident and arrest of BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyay. A senior BJP leader said that the event was not organised by BJP.The Aam Aadmi Party also refused to comment.Anil Chaudhary, Delhi Congress chief, said that such inciting statements aimed at spoiling the secular fabric of the national capital will not be tolerated and the police should go into a detailed investigation into the backgrounds and motives of the people who were caught.“For the last few years, since the northeast Delhi violence, we have seen repeated attempts to spoil the secular fabric of Delhi. We will not allow this particular section to disturb the peace that we proudly uphold. To raise such provocative slogans right in the heart of the Capital should attract strict action,” Chaudhary said.In the afternoon on Tuesday, nearly 40 supporters of the arrested men gathered at the Connaught Place police station and sat on the road to protest against the arrest. The protesters, including self-proclaimed Hindu leader Ragini Tiwari, first reached the police station and demanded the release of the arrested men. When they were asked to leave, they all blocked the traffic on a road outside the police station. All of them were later removed and sent back to their destination by bus, the police said.Around 4 pm, over 100 civil society members and student activists Civil society members and student activists gathered near Jantar Mantar to protest against the anti-Muslim slogans raised purportedly during Sunday’s event organised in the same area to demand the abolition of colonial-era laws.“The protesters had not applied for the police permission for their protest on Tuesday. They had given a call on social media and reached near Jantar Mantar. We removed all of them in buses. A total of 25 men and nine women were detained at the Mandir Marg police station and later released,” said DCP Yadav.Among the protesters were members of All India Students Association (AISA), Students Federation of India (SFI) and other student groups and civil society members.Condemning the detention of protesters, AISA in a statement said, “Delhi police has detained AISA activists and other protesters form Jantar mantar who gathered to protest against the hate mongering by BJP-RSS. Whilst their hate gathering was allowed to continue, the protest call for Justice and against communal bigotry was abrupted by Delhi Police by detaining students, activists and people of Delhi.”SFI also issued a statement saying that some of their members were also detained by the police. “Today’s gathering was aimed resisting the communal polarization with a message of peace and secularism...SFI strongly condemns the hypocrite character of the Delhi Police, wherein on the one hand gatherings by BJP and RSS organisations to fuel genocidal and communal sentiments are permitted, and on the other, citizen’s protest calling for peace and harmony are attacked,” said SFI Delhi president Sumit Kataria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bjp-leader-among-six-arrested-for-anti-muslim-sloganeering-at-jantar-mantar-101628620463183.html
11-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi airport’s Terminal 1 likely to reopen by mid-October||After remaining shut down for over one-and-a-half years, Terminal 1 (T1) of the Indira Gandhi International airport may finally be made operational by mid-October as the Delhi airport has been witnessing rapid increase in the number of passengers over the last few weeks, officials said.Delhi airport recorded around 100,000 passengers on Monday, which is nearly half of the average daily footfall of 200,000 recorded before Covid-19 rocked the country. Officials said the daily passengers’ figure stood at around 45,000 two weeks ago.A Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) official, on the condition of anonymity, said a decision on the date of reopening is being considered, adding that the reopening will be smooth even with just a week’s notice as they have already carried out all the maintenance work.Sachin Badshah, the deputy inspector-general (DIG) of CISF, said that his force is already stationed at all terminals for security, and said that they are ready for T1 to be made operational.T1 was shut on March 25 last year, two days after international flight operations were suspended due to the outbreak of Covid-19 in the country.After two months, as air operations resumed in the country, only Terminal 3 was opened. Terminal 2 resumed functioning on October 1 last year but was shut again in May, only to resume operations last month.Officials had earlier decided to open T1 in March but the plan was dropped due to the second wave.Though DIAL officials said they are yet to decide on a date, the reopening plan said T1 will initially see around 120-150 flights a day, including both departure and arrivals. Before the pandemic, the terminal used to cater to at least 250-300 flights, which translates to around 45,000 passengers, in a day, said a DIAL official.Terminal 1, which caters to domestic flights, sees operation of only SpiceJet and Indigo carriers.An official said that the terminal’s expansion, “which will take at least a year and half”, will double the passenger capacity from 20 million to 40 million passengers per annum. The work will be completed by the end of 2023.Under the current expansion plan, the apron area of T1 will be expanded to 6.29 lakh sq metres from 2.82 lakh sq metres. The total area of the terminal, including departure and arrival, will be 1.92 lakh sq metres, around three times of the existing 64,000 sq metres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-airport-s-terminal-1-likely-to-reopen-by-midoctober-101628620162589.html
11-08-2021||Delhi||Bihar man, wanted in murder and extortion cases, arrested from north Delhi||A 23-year-old man from Bihar, allegedly involved in four murder cases including that of the chairman of an agricultural cooperative society, and two extortion cases, was arrested from north Delhi in a joint operation carried out by the Delhi Police’s crime branch and the Bihar Police.Police said that the suspect, Rupam Singh from Motihari East Champaran, who was arrested on Monday, is a school friend of Suman Jha, who runs an extortion gang in Bihar and is involved in 22 cases of murder and extortion.According to police, Singh allegedly used to make extortion calls on WhatsApp using an international number and even demanded ₹10 lakh from a businessman dealing in furniture in Bihar’s Motihari.Singh, who secured bail in two murder cases in 2019, was wanted for his alleged involvement in two more murders between December 2020 and March 2021.In July this year, Singh allegedly tried to extort ₹2 lakh from another businessman in Motihari, following which a case was registered at the local police station, said joint commissioner of police (crime) Alok Kumar.Joint CP Kumar said that on Monday, the Bihar Police shared information about the presence of Singh in north Delhi’s Gopalpur near Wazirabad.“Accordingly, a joint raid was conducted and Singh was arrested from a rented room in Gopalpur. He was handed over to the Bihar Police for further legal action,” said Kumar, adding that Singh had made the last extortion call on Sunday.Police said that Singh dropped out of college, where he was pursuing an arts course, in 2017.He joined Jha’s gang in March 2019, and soon he, along with another gang member, killed two men in Ghorasahan in East Champaran. He also allegedly tried to murder his relative in May 2019.Thereafter, in August 2019, Singh was arrested with illegal firearms but he managed to secure bail in all the three cases in November 2020.“A month later, he, along with three others, killed one Ranjeet Singh Thekedar. In March 2021, Singh and two others murdered Pawan Gupta, a Primary Agricultural Credit Society (PACS) chairman in Motihari, which led to a law and order situation in the area. Thereafter, he made extortion calls to two businessmen for ₹2 lakh and ₹10 lakh respectively in July and August,” added the joint CP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-man-wanted-in-murder-and-extortion-cases-arrested-from-north-delhi-101628620102613.html
11-08-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal tells officials to expedite development works in unauthorised colonies||The Delhi government has completed 613 road and street development projects in the city’s unauthorised colonies between 2013 and 2018, an official statement said.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday chaired a review meeting of the special projects in which, the statement said, he stressed on completion of works within “stipulated deadlines” as at least 237 more projects are to be completed by the end of this year.Most street and road development works inside unauthorised colonies are done by the municipal corporations. But, contracts for development works in these colonies were issued under the Delhi government’s special projects by the Flood & Irrigation department and Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (DSIIDC) between 2013 and 2018.Delhi has nearly 1,800 unauthorised colonies -- unplanned residential settlements where properties had no legal sanction to be registered on paper and transactions were not recognised until recently. In 2018, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), which comes under the central government, launched a scheme for registry of properties in such colonies by bringing them under the ambit of the PM-UDAY scheme. Roughly around 6 million people -- which is around one-third of Delhi’s population -- are believed to be the residents of the city’s unauthorised colonies, according to government’s estimates.The development works in unauthorised colonies are significant at this point because Delhi goes to municipal polls next year. Currently, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is in charge of the city government, and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rules all three municipal corporations in the city.“All officers should get their projects completed within the stipulated time so that the residents can get these necessities as soon as possible. Adequate funds will be provided to maintain the speed and quality of work; finance department will disburse the required amount... Irrigation and Flood Control Department and DSIIDC officials present detailed project reports of ongoing projects to CM Arvind Kejriwal,” said the statement issued by the government after Tuesday’s review meeting.The meeting was attended by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, urban development minister Satyendar Jain, Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Dev and senior officers from the departments concerned, said the statement.The Irrigation and Flood Control Department has unauthorised colonies in 47 assembly constituencies under its purview where a total of 784 unauthorised colonies have been earmarked. Of these, road and street construction projects have received administrative approvals and expenditure sanctions in 755 project works. 737 works have been taken up as of date in 535 unauthorised colonies. Officials said 441 projects have been completed and the rest are under progress.The unauthorised colonies where the flood and irrigation department has taken up major road projects include Narela, Bawana, Timarpur, Mundka, Sultanpur Majra, Patel Nagar, Sangam Vihar, Vikaspuri, Uttam Nagar, Shalimar Bagh, Matiala, Najafgarh, Malviya Nagar, Sangam Vihar, Badarpur, Okhla, Kondli, Gandhi Nagar, Ghonda, Gokalpur, Vishwasnagar, Laxmi Nagar, Mustafabad, Model Town, Chandni Chowk, Moti Nagar, Rajouri Garden, Mehrauli, Seemapuri and Rohtash Nagar.The statement further said, “Presently DSIIDC is doing development work only in 11 assembly constituencies in which, Chhatarpur, Deoli, Bijwasan, Karawal Nagar, Dwarka, Palam, Janakpuri, Patparganj, Krishna Nagar, Rohini, Delhi Cantt assembly constituencies are included. Apart from this, some colonies falling in Kirari, Vikaspuri, Gokulpur and Bawana assembly constituencies have been handed over to DSIIDC for doing development work. Thus, DSIIDC has been entrusted with the responsibility of undertaking development work in 352 unauthorized colonies. Out of this, construction of road and rain water drain has been completed in 172 colonies, while work is in progress in 69 colonies and funds have been released for proposed work in 111 colonies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-tells-officials-to-expedite-development-works-in-unauthorised-colonies-101628619683178.html
11-08-2021||Pune||CET for FYJC admissions cancelled: Pune students disappointed; cut-offs to be higher, say principals||As the Bombay High Court on Tuesday quashed the state government’s decision to have Common Entrance Tests (CET) for Class 11 admissions, there will be a major impact on admissions this academic year. The cut-off marks for prominent colleges will be higher, as per principals.On May 28, the state government issued a notification about conducting the CET exam which was scheduled on August 21. In an order by the bench of Justices RD Dhanuka and Riyaz Chagla it was observed that, “The Maharashtra state government does not has the power under law to issue such a notification and this court can intervene in the extreme case of gross injustice, such as this.”The high court has also instructed the state government to carry out the admission process within six weeks on the basis of Class 10 and internal assessment marks. Prof Ravindrasinh Pardeshi, principal, Fergusson College said, “There would certainly be an increase in cut-offs for this year’s admissions, as the passing percentage and number of students is high compared to last year. As always, our college cut-offs are high, last year it was as high as 97.6 per cent for Arts and 97 per cent for Science. It is excepted that cut-offs will increase marginally this time as now CET has been cancelled. It will be completely based on Class 10 marks and assessment.”Principal Avinash Takawale, president of the Nationalist Teachers Association, said, “The state government has completely failed in its case before the HC and it is now going to impact lakhs of students. This is going to adversely impact careers as well.” As the Class 10 examinations were cancelled this year due to the pandemic, the passing percentage of students was 99.95 per cent, which was 4.65 per cent more than last year. While 957 students scored 100 per cent marks, over one lakh students scored above 90 per cent this year. Students are unhappy with the decision. Vaidehi Kamte a student said, “I had joined a special batch of CET classes and was preparing well for the exams and suddenly we are told there won’t be any examination. This is irritating as well as demoralising for us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/cet-for-fyjc-admissions-cancelled-students-disappointed-cut-offs-to-be-higher-say-principals-101628613563254.html
11-08-2021||Pune||After Mumbai, Pune demands opening up of local trains||PUNE: Following chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s announcement that all those persons in Mumbai who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 can resume local train travel, residents of Pune district are demanding the same relaxation.Thackeray on August 8 announced that all those in Mumbai who are fully vaccinated and have completed the 14-day period after their second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine can apply on a specially-created application (app) for a special railway pass on their smartphones. However, the scenario in Pune is different.Manoj Jhawar, spokesperson, Pune railway division, said, “Currently, approximately 3,500 to 4,000 people are travelling every day via local trains. Once the decision is made by the state government, we will then plan accordingly.”Harsha Shah, chairperson, Railway Pravasi Group, said, “Why is Pune being given step-motherly treatment? If locals can start in Mumbai, they should be started for all in Pune as well; we are ready to follow all instructions. People from the Pune district who travel every day to Daund, Ranjangaon, Chakan, Dehu and other places for work have been spending twice the amount of money on transport. The government should think about it seriously.”Only eight trains have been allowed between Pune and Lonavla, that too for essential services due to Covid restrictions. Not only Pune to Lonavla, but Pune to Daund also sees heavy traffic with people returning to their offices facing severe logjams. An office-goer who has to travel from Khadki to Daund every day said, “I don’t feel like riding a two-wheeler as it is not a safe option but am still doing it as we are no longer allowed to work from home. Like Mumbai, local trains should be opened for the common public in Pune as well.”Meanwhile, the railways are keeping track of bogus passengers who are trying to travel by train despite being ineligible due to Covid regulations. “Once the person is caught without an id, s/he will not be allowed to complete the journey. Generally we find 15 such cases every day. The government should allow the general public to travel now,” said a travelling ticket examiner (TTE) on condition of anonymity at Chinchwad station on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/after-mumbai-pune-demands-opening-up-of-local-trains-101628612961827.html
11-08-2021||Pune||60 officials claim vehicle allowance, but still use PMC cars: survey||PUNE The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) claims 60 Class-I officials are currently claiming a four-wheeler allowance, but are still using vehicles provided by the civic body. Based on complaints received by the then additional municipal commissioner, Rubal Agarwal, the PMC vehicle depot conducted a survey and, on Tuesday, sent a list to the chief accountant for further action. Agarwal, in her capacity as additional municipal commissioner, before she recently got transferred, had ordered the vehicle department to scrutinise records to establish the use of official vehicles.Hitendre Kurane, superintendent, PMC vehicle depot, said, “As per the order, we have 60 officials who are using PMC four-wheelers for official visits, as per PMC Motor vehicle policy-2016. However, these 60 officials are also claiming a four-wheeler allowance.”The additional commissioner, in her order, had asked the chief accountant to recover the travelling allowance from salaries of officials guilty of claiming both benefits.A senior official of the account’s department, speaking anonymously, said, “We cannot reveal the names of officials, but we will recover the allowances from their salaries. Now, we are calculating the time period and the amount.”There are 170 Class-I officials, including the commissioner, additional commissioners, zonal commissioners, heads of department (HoDs), superintendent engineers, assistant municipal commissioners, deputy commissioners, and assistant medical officers. Executive engineers are eligible to use four-wheelers only for field visits, but they have to take permission from an additional commissioner. The corporation pays ₹3,150 per month as a four-wheeler allowance to executive officers, and ₹4,200 per month for posts above the level of an executive officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/60-officials-claim-4-wheeler-allowance-but-still-use-pmc-cars-vehicle-depot-survey-101628612601851.html
11-08-2021||Pune||Pune civic body approves ₹392 crore for drainage work in 11 merged villages||The standing committee of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), on Tuesday, cleared work on drainage and sewage treatment plants in 11 villages merged into the municipal limits in 2017. The standing committee approved ₹392 crore to be spent on repairing or developing drainage lines, a major issue in these 11 villages.Even though these 11 villages merged in 2017, PMC has not been able to allocate any substantial amount for basic development work here, until now. Standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane said, “The standing committee has given its nod to carry out sewage related works in the 11 villages merged in 2017 in PMC.”The villages, which were earlier under gram panchayats, continue to face neglect and the civic body has been unable to spend even 10 per cent of the ₹100 crore approved for developmental work. Residents of the villages continue to face problems related to infrastructure, including road, sewage and drainage issues. After the merger, PMC had made a budgetary provision of ₹100 crore for giving basic amenities in these villages. Officials from the administration claim that most of the proposals for various development works in the areas are in the tender stage. Municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar, who put the proposal before the standing committee, said, “All these works will be carried out in the next three years.

11-08-2021||World||Biden administration seeking ways to address rising energy prices||President Joe Biden's administration is moving at home and abroad to try to address concerns about rising energy prices slowing the nation's recovery from the pandemic-induced recession.National security adviser Jake Sullivan on Wednesday called on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to move faster to restore global supply of petroleum to pre-pandemic levels, and the White House asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the domestic gasoline market for any anti-competitive behavior that could be increasing prices.The joint actions come as the administration is increasingly sensitive to rising prices across the economy as it faces both political and policy pressure from inflation.“Higher gasoline costs, if left unchecked, risk harming the ongoing global recovery," Sullivan said in a statement. He said the administration was pressuring OPEC and producers allied with the cartel to more quickly undo the production cuts put in place at the start of the pandemic.“The production cuts made during the pandemic should be reversed as the global economy recovers in order to lower prices for consumers," Biden said Wednesday.Biden's National Economic Council director, Brian Deese, asked the FTC head, Lina Khan, to “monitor the US gasoline market and address any illegal conduct that might be contributing to price increases for consumers at the pump.” The FTC is an independent agency and may take advice, but not direction, from the White House.Wednesday’s report from the Labor Department showed that consumer prices jumped 0.5% from June to July, down from the previous monthly increase of 0.9%. They have increased a substantial 5.4% compared with a year earlier, erasing much of the benefit to workers from higher pay.Gas prices are up about a $1 from than a year ago as Americans hit peak summer driving season and return to roads after pandemic shut-ins. The White House says it's no cause for alarm, saying the country is “not at an historically high gas price moment" and that prices are roughly where they were in 2018, still Biden acknowledged they're high enough to “pinch” working families.“I want to make sure that nothing stands in the way of oil price declines leading to lower gas prices for consumers,” Biden added.Rising prices, both at the pump and across other consumer goods, have become a potent talking point among Biden's GOP critics. The White House has insisted that inflation will cool as the economy recovers from the twin shocks of the pandemic and the nation's ongoing recovery from the virus-induced lockdowns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-seeking-ways-to-address-rising-energy-prices-101628705104375.html

He was arrested after flying back from Germany where he had recovered from a nerve agent poisoning.The Investigative Committee, which probes serious crimes, said in a statement that Navalny had been charged with creating an organisation that "infringes on the personality and rights of citizens", a crime punishable by up to three years in jail.A jail term of that length could keep Navalny in custody past the next presidential election in 2024 when Putin's current six-year term in the Kremlin is due to end.The Investigative Committee said that Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation had incited Russians to break the law and take part in unauthorised protests demanding his release in January that authorities said were illegal.Navalny and his allies have faced pressure for years, but his political network was outlawed in June after a court formally labelled his anti-corruption foundation and regional campaign groups as extremist.Several of his closest allies have left the country for fear of prosecution, and his team has also disbanded their regional groups to protect activists.Allies who post on social media under the name Team Navalny described the accusation as "the latest meaningless charge"."No one infringes on the personality and rights of citizens like Putin himself and all his henchmen, including the Investigative Committee," they said on Telegram messenger.The charge comes a day after the Investigative Committee on Tuesday announced a new criminal investigation into two close Navalny allies, who are based abroad, for raising funds for his political network.On Sunday, Russian media outlets reported that Lyubov Sobol, a close Navalny associate, had left Russia and flown to Turkey. She has not commented on her whereabouts and her allies have declined to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-hits-kremlin-critic-navalny-with-new-charge-that-could-add-to-jail-term-101628703763649.html
11-08-2021||World||WHO to conduct international trials of these three drugs for Covid-19 treatment||The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday announced major international trials to test three new drugs in hospitalised coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients. Under the next phase of the Solidarity trial, called Solidarity PLUS, artesunate, imatinib and infliximab will be tested on thousands of volunteer patients in more than 600 hospitals in 52 countries, 16 more countries than the first phase of trials.“Finding more effective and accessible therapeutics for Covid-19 patients remains a critical need, and WHO is proud to lead this global effort,” WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press briefing.The largest global collaboration among WHO member states allows the trial to assess multiple treatments using a single protocol, according to the UN health agency. Through the expansive programme, new treatments could be added and ineffective treatment could be dropped throughout the course of the trial. In the first phase, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and interferon were evaluated for the treatment of hospitalised Covid-19 patients but the results showed the four drugs had little or no effect.“I would like to thank the participating governments, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, clinicians and patients, who have come together to do this in true global solidarity,” said Tedros.The three drugs to be tested under Solidarity PLUS are already used for other diseases.Artesunate is used to treat malaria. During the trial, the intravenous drug will be administered for seven days, using the standard dose recommended for the treatment of severe malaria. According to WHO, artemisinin and its derivatives have been extensively used in the treatment of malaria and other parasitic diseases for over 30 years.Imatinib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat certain cancers. The drug will be administered orally once everyday for 14 days.Johnson and Johnson’s infliximab, a TNF alpha inhibitor, is used to treat diseases of the immune system. The intravenous drug will be administered during the trial as a single dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-to-conduct-international-trials-of-these-three-drugs-for-covid-19-treatment-101628703274280.html
11-08-2021||World||US CDC urges Covid-19 vaccines during pregnancy as Delta surges||The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged all pregnant women Wednesday to get the Covid-19 vaccine as hospitals in hot spots around the U.S. see disturbing numbers of unvaccinated mothers-to-be seriously ill with the virus.Expectant women run a higher higher risk of severe illness and pregnancy complications from the coronavirus, including perhaps miscarriages and stillbirths. But their vaccination rates are low, with only about 23% having received at least one dose, according to CDC data.‘’The vaccines are safe and effective, and it has never been more urgent to increase vaccinations as we face the highly transmissible delta variant and see severe outcomes from Covid-19 among unvaccinated pregnant people,’’ CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a statement.The updated guidance comes after a CDC analysis of new safety data on 2,500 women showed no increased risks of miscarriage for those who received at least one dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine before 20 weeks of pregnancy. The analysis found a miscarriage rate of around 13%, within the normal range.The CDC’s advice echoes recent recommendations from top obstetrician groups. The agency had previously encouraged pregnant women to consider vaccination but had stopped short of a full recommendation. The new advice also applies to nursing mothers and women planning to get pregnant.Although pregnant women were not included in studies that led to authorization of Covid-19 vaccines, experts say real-world experience in tens of thousands of women shows that the shots are safe for them and that when given during pregnancy may offer some protection to newborns.The new guidance comes amid a surge in Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S., driven by the highly contagious delta variant.Some health authorities believe the variant may cause more severe disease — in pregnant women and others as well — than earlier versions of the virus, though that is still under investigation.National figures show the latest surge in cases among pregnant women is lower than it was during the outbreak's winter peak. But at some hospitals in states with low vaccination rates, the numbers of sick mothers-to-be outpace those during earlier surges, before vaccines were available.“This is by far the worst we’ve seen in the pandemic,’’ said Dr. Jane Martin, an obstetrician with Ochsner Baptist Medical Center in New Orleans. She added: “It’s disheartening and it’s exhausting. It feels like it doesn’t have to be like this.”At the beginning of the pandemic and with each surge, Ochsner had a few pregnant patients very sick with the virus, though the numbers had dwindled in recent months.“A week or two ago that pace changed drastically,’’ Martin said. “We have had multiple critically ill pregnant patients admitted’’ every day, most requiring intensive care.Martin said she has taken care of at least 30 pregnant patients hospitalized with Covid-19 over the last two weeks. Most were unvaccinated.Experts say the lifting of mask rules and other social distancing precautions and the rise of the delta variant have contributed to the worrisome trend. But also, vaccinations weren’t made available to women of childbearing age and others under 65 until spring.Early in her pregnancy, Tennessee kindergarten teacher Sara Brown decided she would wait until the baby was born to get the shots. There wasn’t much safety data yet about getting vaccinated during pregnancy, and at 36, she was young, healthy and “figured if I did get it, it would probably just be a bad cold.’’But what seemed like a sinus infection in June turned into severe Covid-19, landing her in a Nashville intensive care unit for five days, on oxygen and struggling to breathe.Her daughter Suzie was born healthy on Aug. 2. But it was a harrowing experience.“Not being able to catch your breath is such a panicky feeling, knowing I had life inside me that could be suffering too,’’ she said.At Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where Brown was treated, there were no infected pregnant patients early in July. Now the hospital is admitting four to five a week, all unvaccinated, said obstetrician Dr. Jennifer Thompson. About 20% of those patients are being treated in the intensive care unit, compared with 11% during previous surges, she said.For some pregnant patients critically ill with Covid-19, organs begin to fail and doctors induce labor early or deliver babies by cesarean section as a last resort, said Dr. Jeannie Kelly, an obstetrician at Washington University Medical Center in St. Louis.About 20% of all patients admitted for labor and delivery last week at the St. Louis hospital are infected, more than double the rate during the Covid-19 surge in Missouri last year, she said. About one-third of these women are critically ill.Around 105,000 pregnant U.S. women have been infected with Covid-19, and almost 18,000 have been hospitalized, according to the CDC. About one-fourth of those received intensive care and 124 died.Pregnancy-related changes in body functions may explain why the virus can be dangerous for mothers-to-be. These include reduced lung capacity and adjustments in the disease-fighting immune system that protect and help the fetus grow.The risks are disproportionately high for Black and Hispanic women, who are more likely to face health care and economic inequalities that increase their chances of getting sick.Some studies suggest the virus can also increase the risks of preterm birth and stillbirth, and in rare cases, it appears to have passed from mother to fetus.Martin, the New Orleans obstetrician, noted that local hospitals are also treating increasing numbers of children and babies sick with Covid-19, some of whom may have been infected after birth by unvaccinated mothers.Martin was pregnant when she got her own shots last winter. She delivered a healthy baby girl a week after the last shot.“Vaccinating people is the only way out,’’ she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cdc-urges-covid-19-vaccines-during-pregnancy-as-delta-surges-101628699496968.html
11-08-2021||World||Explained: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's legal woes far from over||Here is an overview of the civil lawsuits and criminal investigations likely to face New York Governor Andrew Cuomo for months to come as he returns to private life following his resignation on Tuesday over a sexual harassment scandal.Has Cuomo been charged with any crimes?No. He is under criminal investigation.Prosecutors in Manhattan, Nassau County, Albany County, Westchester County and Oswego County have requested evidence from an independent inquiry launched by New York Attorney General Letitia James while looking into the matter.These local prosecutors, known as district attorneys, would be the ones to bring any criminal charges.The report for James found he groped, kissed or made suggestive comments to women including government workers past and present - one a state trooper - and retaliated against at least one woman who accused him of sexual misconduct.Cuomo has denied wrongdoing. He said he accepted "full responsibility" for what he characterized as ill-conceived attempts to be affectionate or humorous but said he would resign in two weeks for the good of the state.Cuomo's lawyer Rita Glavin has said James's probe, which was civil in nature, “was conducted to support a predetermined narrative” and “left material out.”One of Cuomo's accusers, Brittany Commisso, last week filed a complaint with police in Albany, alleging the governor groped her breast at the Executive Mansion last November.Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple said at a news conference that his office would conduct a thorough investigation.What crimes could prosecutors be considering?Apple said Commisso's complaint alleging Cuomo groped her could lead to misdemeanor charges.The two most applicable crimes under New York law would be "forcible touching" and "sexual abuse in the third degree," said Julie Rendelman, a criminal defense attorney and former Brooklyn prosecutor.Forcible touching, the more serious of the two misdemeanors, can lead to a maximum sentence of one year in jail, but Rendelman said a prison sentence was "very unlikely" for any defendant who had not previously been charged with a crime.Does Cuomo's stature more or less likely to be charged?Ross Garber, a lawyer who focuses on political investigations, said Cuomo's resignation could take some public pressure off New York prosecutors to charge him."Given the variety of criminal probes, the divergent issues, and various jurisdictions, it’s impossible to say with certainty" whether Cuomo will be charged, Garber said. "But resignation does take a bit of oxygen out of the wildfire that has been building for consequences for Cuomo’s actions."Are there obstacles to a criminal case?In criminal cases, the prosecution must establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.Deborah Tuerkheimer, a Northwestern University law professor and former prosecutor, said Cuomo's accusers may be reluctant to put themselves through the emotional turmoil of a criminal trial if he is only charged with misdemeanors."It's really difficult to testify in a criminal trial," Tuerkheimer said.Judith Olin, a University at Buffalo law professor and a former New York state prosecutor who specialized in sexual assault cases, said any prosecution could face an uphill climb given the lack of physical evidence and witnesses.What about civil lawsuits?A lawyer for Lindsey Boylan, a former aide who was the first woman to accuse Cuomo publicly last December, has said she plans to file a lawsuit against Cuomo. Other accusers could follow her lead, Rendelman said.A landmark federal law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibits sex discrimination, which includes sexual harassment, in the workplace.Cuomo accusers who invoke this law would be suing the state of New York - their employer - rather than Cuomo directly, said Ann Juliano, a Villanova University law professor.Under New York law, sexual harassment includes unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature - from sexual jokes to unwanted flirtation - that creates an offensive work environment, regardless of intent.Juliano said Cuomo's accusers could rely on a landmark New York law, championed by Cuomo in 2019, that made it easier for sexual harassment victims to prove their cases in court. Alleged victims no longer have to meet the high bar of proving sexual harassment is "severe and pervasive."To prevail in a civil lawsuit, Cuomo's accusers would only need to convince jurors that there was a greater than 50% chance that their allegations were true.What other legal problems does Cuomo face?Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn are investigating whether, as governor, Cuomo deliberately played down the number of deaths in nursing homes related to COVID-19.New York health officials released a report in July denying that their policies had caused any increase in deaths.James, the attorney general, has also been investigating whether Cuomo misused state resources to write and promote a book he published last October about his leadership during the early months of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-new-york-governor-andrew-cuomo-s-legal-woes-far-from-over-101628696974961.html

WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press briefing Wednesday that though Marburg, a deadly cousin of Ebola, is a very different virus from Sars-CoV-2, many of the elements of the response are the same, including isolation, tracing, and quarantining their contacts.“WHO and our partners are supporting Guinea’s ministry of health to investigate the source of the outbreak, trace contacts, and inform the local community about how to protect themselves,” Tedros said in his opening remarks.On Friday, Guinea informed the UN health agency of a case of Marburg virus disease in the country’s southwest. The patient, also the first known case of Marburg in West Africa, died 8 days after the onset of symptoms. The highly dangerous pathogen causes haemorrhagic fever and, according to past outbreaks, the average fatality rate is 50 per cent.“There is no licensed vaccine for Marburg, although there are vaccines under development, and WHO is working with our partners to seek opportunities to assess them during this outbreak through the R&D Blueprint for Epidemics,” Tedros added.Also Read | Guinea confirms first case of Marburg disease: All you need to knowThe natural reservoir of the Marburg virus is the African fruit bat. The virus takes its name from the German city of Marburg where it was first identified in 1967. The outbreak was associated with a laboratory where workers had been in contact with African green monkeys imported from Uganda.According to the WHO, the incubation period for Marburg virus disease varies from 2 to 21 days. The symptoms include high fever, severe headaches, muscular pain, vomiting and diarrhoea, which makes Marburg difficult to diagnose initially as they are similar to typhoid and malaria.“Haemorrhagic episodes typically follow between five and seven days later, with blood in the vomit and faeces and bleeding from the nose, gums and vagina. In fatal cases, death occurs most often between eight and nine days,” the WHO says on its website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-150-contacts-of-marburg-virus-case-ebola-s-deadly-cousin-identified-who-101628695403878.html

They are concentrating all their efforts to capture Mazar-e-Sharif, a bustling city in the north and the capital of Balkh province.Some politicians in Balkh province have established a new mobilisation council in the province to protect the city. This council consists of officials and representatives of the parties and has elected former Balkh Governor Atta Mohammad Noor as its chairman. India has already evacuated its staff from Mazar-e-Sharif in the wake of raging fighting.President Ashraf Ghani flew to Mazar-e-Sharif on Wednesday to rally old warlords to the defence of the biggest city in the north. Ghani convened a meeting, which was attended by top leaders including Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum and Atta Mohammad Noor. The leaders discussed the security situation in the north and chalked out the plan to defend Mazar-e-Sharif from Taliban.With US and NATO forces announcing withdrawal from the country, the Taliban have intensified their assault on major cities and seized control of Sar-e-Pul, Sheberghan, Aybak, Kunduz, Taluqan, Pul-e-Khumri, Farah, Zaranj.The loss of Faizabad, the capital city of Badakhshan, on Wednesday was the latest setback for the Afghan government, which has been struggling to stem the momentum of Taliban.Faizabad is the eighth provincial capital to fall since last week. According to local reports, 65 per cent of Afghanistan's territory is already under the control of the Sunni Pashtun insurgent group.The Afghan defence ministry said on Wednesday that 439 Taliban terrorists were killed and 77 injured in different operations carried out by the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF) across Afghan provinces in the past 24 hours. The neutralised terrorists also included four terrorists of Pakistani origin.As Taliban fighters continue to overrun swathes of land in Afghanistan, more and more cases of human rights violations are being reported. Afghan minister of justice Fazil Ahmad Manawi said that the country’s children are being forcefully taken by Taliban across the Durand Line into Pakistan where they are being trained in terrorism in the name of Islamic education. The Afghan Minister stated that children aged 13 and 14 were often taken to remote areas and districts of Afghanistan by so-called ‘religious scholars’ with deceptive Islamic teachings and sent to Balochistan.Voices of condemnation are coming from various quarters, particularly from Afghan residents who are demanding the global community to free the country from the scourge of Taliban. Among them is Afghan cricketer Rashid Khan who urged world leaders through a tweet on Tuesday that thousands of families have been displaced. “Don’t leave us in chaos. Stop killing Afghans and destroying Afghanistan.”Afghan human rights watchdog Women’s United Voice Advisory Group on Peace Policy said that the Taliban’s action of forceful marriages , which it termed as “jihad marriage”, should be documented worldwide and the group’s crimes against women should be documented in cooperation with human rights organizations.Afghanistan’s acting minister of finance Khalid Payenda stepped down on Tuesday and left Kabul for the US. however, local media reports said Payenda was fired by President Ashraf Ghani due to his incompetence and lack of achievement.China, meanwhile, has said that it is ready to play a ‘constructive role’ in facilitating negotiations through various channels to promote peaceful settlement of the Afghan issue. In an interview with China Central Television (CCTV), China’s special envoy for Afghan affairs, Yue Xiaoyong, said, “China will make unremitting efforts with the international community, neighboring countries and countries in the region."A multilateral meeting on Afghan peace process was held in Doha on Tuesday, in which special envoys on Afghanistan and interlocutors called parties for a political settlement to achieve enduring peace in the county. Representatives from China, the US, the UK, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, the United Nations, and the European Union participated in the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-president-ashraf-ghani-in-balkh-amid-taliban-offensive-for-mazaresharif-101628692546511.html

In a video shared by the UN health agency, a senior WHO official said that a lot of travel can be managed safely if countries gradually ease the curbs. Several countries have resumed international flights to boost their airline and tourism industry which are badly hit by the restrictions imposed to contain coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s health emergencies programme, stressed that the economy won’t be revived unless countries get their way out of Covid-19.“If you go on a country from 10% normal travel and you go overnight to 100% travel, then our advice is always to start slowly, open up slowly, take it step-it-step and see if that affects your situation positively or negatively and then adjust as needed,” Ryan said.Traveling safely during #COVID19 requires careful consideration and planning. @DrMikeRyan and Dr @mvankerkhove discuss how you can make safe travel-related decisions as the northern hemisphere summer continues ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/iItOhCJdePMaria Van Kerkhove, Covid-19 technical lead at WHO, asked travellers to take responsibility while travelling by adhering to guidelines required by governments and airlines.“If they asked to wear a mask throughout travelling wear that mask, carry your hand gel with you, take all of those precautions as you go through that stage of leaving your house to entering into that other country, that other place that you live,” she said.“The virus travels in people and so you could be infected in the place that you are travelling. You have a responsibility to keep yourself safe, keep those who you're travelling with safe and also not to bring the virus around with you,” Van Kerkhove added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-shares-guidelines-for-safe-travel-as-countries-reopen-their-borders-101628690785681.html
11-08-2021||World||'Will make them realize': North Korea warns US, South Korea over 'hostile acts'||North Korea on Wednesday denounced South Korea for moving ahead with its plan of joint military exercise with the United States despite repeated warnings. In a statement released on state media Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol said that “peace and trust” touted by Seoul was a mere wordplay as they opted for an alliance with “outsiders” but not with “compatriots”.“As we have already clarified, we will make them realize by the minute what a dangerous choice they made and what a serious security crisis they will face because of their wrong choice,” KCNA quoted Kim, a former Pyongyang’s spymaster, as saying.South Korea and the US have begun preliminary military drills as they prepare for full-scale exercises scheduled from August 16-26, reported the Yonhap news agency. On Tuesday, South Korea said that the North didn’t answer routine calls in inter-Korean hotlines that were recently restored hotlines suspended a year ago by Pyongyang.While Seoul and Washington insist that preliminary drills are designed to examine the allies’ readiness to respond to a potential contingency, Pyongyang sees it as confrontation. Kim said South Korea must realise “how dearly they have to pay for answering our good faith with hostile acts after letting go the opportunity for improved inter-Korean relations.”“It is clear that there is no other option for us as South Korea and the US opted for confrontation with our state, without making any change,” he added.North Korea has been facing sanctions from the United States over its nuclear activity and intercontinental ballistic missiles. Washington recently indicated that it is not willing to lift any sanctions as a precondition to restart talks with Pyongyang. US state department spokesperson Ned Price said last week that the Biden administration welcomes the restoration of inter-Korean communication lines and is willing to meet North Korean leaders “anytime, anywhere, without preconditions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-make-them-realize-north-korea-warns-us-south-korea-over-hostile-acts-101628682536768.html

From August 8, India has been moved to the amber list allowing India flyers to enter the United Kingdom.Pakistan minister Fawad Chaudhry had tweeted an online petition that calls for removing Pakistan from the red list.Comparing Pakistan's Covid situation with that of India, Iran and Iraq, Dr Faisal said that Pakistan's daily cases per million people (21.18) are the lowest in the region. In his statement, he said India's daily cases per million people is 28.84, while the figure for Iran and Iraq are 421.98 and 276.19, respectively.The UK government in its statement on why it kept Pakistan on the red list said, "In Pakistan, the combination of a deteriorating epidemiological situation, combined with low testing rates and limited genomic surveillance, presents a high risk that an outbreak of a new variant, or existing VoC, will not be identified before it is imported to the UK." It also said the current trajectory of the pandemic in Pakistan is also of particular concern. In the past 7 days, the incidence of cases in Pakistan has increased by 87 per cent on the previous week (19-25 July)."Pakistan has no interest in allowing those of its nationals who pose a health risk to other societies to travel abroad, any more than allowing potential threats to public health entry within its jurisdiction," Dr Faisal wrote in reply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indophile-imran-khan-s-minister-on-uk-allowing-flights-from-india-but-not-from-pakistan-101628683664925.html
11-08-2021||World||China to ban karaoke songs that endanger territorial integrity||Singing certain songs at a karaoke bar could endanger national unity, territorial integrity and will be banned, the Chinese government has said.Interim regulations coming into effect from October 1 says the government will create a “blacklist” for karaoke songs and will ban them.“China will create a blacklist for karaoke songs, banning those that contain harmful content at karaoke venues across the country,” the Chinese culture and tourism ministry announced on Tuesday.The banned song list will also include songs that are against the country’s religious policies and spread thoughts about cults and superstitions.“On the list are songs containing content that endangers national unity, sovereignty, or territorial integrity; violates China’s religious policies and spreads cults and superstitions; and advocates obscenity, gambling, violence and drug-related crimes or instigating crimes,” according to a set of interim regulations issued by the ministry.The regulations will take effect on October 1, 2021. The banned songs’ list is yet to be released.Officially, China has nearly 50,000 entertainment venues such as karaoke bars, which have a basic music library of over 100,000 songs, the Xinhua report said.Unofficially, the number is likely higher, making that much more difficult for the government machinery to regulate their content.The first time the ministry had taken a similar step was in 2015 when it had banned 120 songs, which “trumpet obscenity, violence, crime or harm social morality”.A report by the Global Times then said: “With titles such as ‘Beijing Hooligans’, ‘Don’t Want to Go to School’ and ‘Suicide Diary’, the banned songs were described as having severely problematic content which violate an online cultural management regulation”.Karaoke, also known as KTV in China, was invented in Japan in the 1970s and introduced to China in the late 1980s, the Xinhua report added.It is popular across age groups and is often considered a favoured mode of socialising among friends and families.In early 2018, the Chinese government had also cracked down on the country’s emerging hip hop music scene, asking broadcasters not to air artistes with tattoos, singing hip hop music and others who were in conflict with the CPC’s values.Given the party’s disapproval, Chinese rappers, instead, have turned patriotic.Like the 100 rappers who recently collaborated for the patriotic rap song “100%” to mark the CPC’s 100th birthday on July 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-ban-karaoke-songs-that-endanger-territorial-integrity-101628681910013.html
11-08-2021||World||Chinese media caught quoting non-existent Swiss expert questioning Covid probe||Chinese state media outlets have removed references of an “alleged Swiss biologist” quoted widely in local and social media on the politicisation of the Covid-19 origin probe after the Switzerland embassy in Beijing said it was a fake news.The removal of articles containing quotes by Wilson Edwards came after the Swiss embassy tweeted that it was unable to trace any citizen or biologist by the name.In the tweet, the embassy said it could not find any registry of a citizen by the name or any academic articles written by Edwards. “Looking for Wilson Edwards alleged [Swiss] biologist…If you exist, we would like to meet you. But it is more likely that this is a fake news,’’ part of the Swiss embassy tweet read.In a more detailed statement attached to the tweet, the embassy said it informs the Chinese public that the news is false. “In the last several days, a large number of press articles and social media posts citing an alleged Swiss biologist have been published in China. While we appreciate the attention on our country, the Embassy of Switzerland must unfortunately inform the Chinese public that this news is false,” the statement from Switzerland read.The deftly written Swiss statement added: “While we assume that the spreading of this story was done in good faith by the media and netizens, we kindly ask that anyone having published this story take it down and publish a corrigendum.”Chinese state media outlets like People’s Daily (PD), China Daily and national broadcaster CGTN were among state media outlets, which had published articles quoting him, attributing it to Edwards’ Facebook profile.The articles cannot be accessed anymore though the PD’s Facebook update, quoting the person remains.The Swiss embassy said the Facebook account was opened in late July and only had three friends. “It is likely that this Facebook account was not opened for social networking purposes,” the Swiss embassy added.A screenshot from the China Daily article, which quotes Wilson, and is circulating online, said: “He (Edwards) said on his Facebook account: ‘As a biologist, I’ve witnessed in consternation over the past months how the origin-tracing of Covid-19 was politicised’.”Communist Party of China’s mouthpiece, People’s Daily’s English website too quoted him. “A European biologist has come to the fore with a startling claim that a World Health Organization (WHO) advisory group on tracing the origins of pathogens, including the virus responsible for the pandemic, would become a political tool.“Bearing the name Wilson Edwards, the person took to social media, including Facebook and Twitter, on July 24 to describe how much he was worried about the ‘WHO’s independence’,” the People’s Daily wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-media-caught-quoting-non-existent-swiss-expert-questioning-covid-probe-101628679869956.html

While the Chinese city of Hotan in Xinjiang province has been named the most polluted city, Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh took the second spot on the list with an average PM2.5 concentration of 106.6µg/m3. PM2.5 refers to fine particulate matter suspended in the air that is two and a half microns or less in width.The air pollution in China’s Hotan, with a PM2.5 of 110.2µg/m3, was largely attributed to local sandstorms given its proximity to the Taklimakan Desert, the world’s largest shifting sand desert. In the case of Ghaziabad, the report says massive traffic volumes in the “gateway” to Uttar Pradesh were likely the cause of the high levels of air pollution.Also Read | Air pollution linked with higher risk of dementia: StudyBangladesh’s Manikganj is in the third position on the list of the world’s most polluted cities with a PM2.5 of 80.2µg/m3. “As one of the fastest developing countries around the world, with its industrial sector growing at a rate of 13% per year, vehicles and industrial emissions are the major contributors to air pollution in this country of 165 million people,” the author said.Of the 50 most polluted cities worldwide, 49 are in Bangladesh, China, Pakistan, and India.

A government official who spoke to the Washington Post on grounds of anonymity said the US military now estimates Kabul’s imminent fall will occur within three months, while others cautioned that it might happen within a month.This news came hours after the Taliban took Faizabad, capital of the northeastern province of Badakhshan, and the eighth provincial capital to fall to the insurgent forces in six days. Badakhshan borders Tajikistan, Pakistan and China. The Taliban had laid siege to Faizabad before launching the final offensive on August 10. The Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) retreated after heavy fighting for hours, Jawad Mujadidi, a provincial council member from Badakhshan told reporters.With the fall of Faizabad, entire northeast Afghanistan will come under the Taliban’s rule, which now controls 65% of the country. A senior European Union official told the Associated Press (AP) on August 10 that the insurgent forces are threatening to take over 11 other provincial capitals to cut off Kabul’s support system, which is reliant on the northern forces. For years the northern part of Afghanistan was the only peaceful region with little presence of the Taliban.Also Read: Powered by Pakistan, Taliban racing towards KabulPresident Biden has reiterated his stance of continuing with the withdrawal of US forces by the end of August, stating explicitly that the matter is not up for debate. “We spent over a trillion dollars over 20 years. We trained and equipped, with modern equipment, over 300,000 Afghan forces. And Afghan leaders have to come together,” Biden told reporters in the White House. The Taliban had promised the US that their troops won’t be attacked and Afghanistan won’t be used as fostering international terrorism in exchange for the withdrawal of US troops but it had never agreed to a ceasefire with the Afghan government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-might-capture-kabul-within-3-months-us-expresses-concern-101628675697502.html
11-08-2021||World||After low-key 2020, India’s I-Day celebrations in Canada to be lively affair||The Indian-origin community in Canada is preparing for expansive 2021 Independence Day celebrations on August 15 as Covid-19 restrictions in the country have been relaxed following high vaccination levels.The main event will be held in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) as “India Day” will be marked on Sunday with a drive-thru parade, organised by Panorama India, which is a Canada-based community body. The “India Day” parade and celebrations were in-person events until 2019, when it attracted nearly 85,000 persons at its downtown Toronto venue. The clock towers in the GTA cities of Brampton and Mississauga will be illuminated in the colours of the India flag on Sunday evening, as will Toronto’s iconic landmark building, CN Tower.Last year, the parade was held entirely online due to the coronavirus pandemic, but plans for this year’s big occasion are ambitious.Organisers are expecting nearly 1,000 vehicles to participate in the drive-thru event in Mississauga, in the GTA. The event will also feature live performances depicting the culture of 21 states. The event will also be live-streamed, with Panorama India head Sumeeta Kohli saying the emphasis is on “safety” while creating an outing experience for demographics worst hit by pandemic measures, such as seniors and children.Kohli said the “effort” was “to bring back the feeling of live celebration and yet ensure safety and all Covid protocols”. She added they wanted to “make the first ever India Day drive thru parade a unique and special event”.A number of cars will feature in celebrations planned in British Columbia, as the organizations - Friends of India in Canada and Gurukul Canada - are putting together a Tiranga Yatra that will feature a cavalcade of vehicles travelling from the town of Surrey to the Indian consulate in Vancouver. Neema Manral, secretary of Friends of India in Canada, said they expected over 300 cars to participate in the rally to mark the day. “We’ve invited people from all communities and have taken police permission for the route,” she said.Meanwhile, Calgary, in the province of Alberta, will host an in-person event dubbed India Fest at an indoor venue in the city. However, keeping Covid-related safety in mind, organisers will limit attendance to 250 people. Principal organiser Sonia Joshi said the focus is on “freedom” this year as the community felt like hostages to the pandemic for months. The attempt this year is at “bringing us all together in a safe environment with almost all vaccinated”, she said.Other cities will also witness celebratory events, including Montreal, where a flag-hoisting ceremony is being organised by the Canada-India Global Forum, its national president Shivendra Dwivedi said. Montreal traditionally hosts an “India Day” parade, organised by the India Canada Organisation, which Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had attended in 2017. However, festivities will be limited to a park, with attendance capped at 50 persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-low-key-2020-india-s-i-day-celebrations-in-canada-to-be-lively-affair-101628670209878.html

Qadri made this claim while appearing for a show on ARY News.Saudi Arabia, on August 9, opened applications, with conditions, from devotees vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) for entry into the kingdom for Umrah, a pilgrimage to Mecca which, unlike Hajj, can be undertaken at any time of the year.Also Read | Umrah pilgrimage: Saudi Arabia to reopen borders for vaccinated travellersAccording to Saudi Arabia’s health ministry, travellers,who have completed two doses of the made-in-China vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), including Sinovac and Sinopharm, should get a booster dose of any of the four other authorised vaccines in the country, to be granted entry. “All visitors arriving in the country with a valid tourism visa must provide evidence of a full course of one of the four vaccines currently recognised: two doses of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, or Moderna vaccines, or a single dose of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine,” the guidelines, which were issued by the Saudi Arabian e-visa portal, stated.Additionally, the guidelines mandate that only those devotees, who have been duly inoculated with a Covid-19 vaccine, will be allowed to enter the holy mosques, including the Al-Masjid an-Nabawi (The Prophet’s Mosque) and Masjid al-Haram (The Great Mosque).Saudi Arabia aims to gradually increase the number of devotees arriving for Umrah to 2 million, from the current 60,000 per month. In July, it welcomed devotees for the annual Hajj pilgrimage; the number, however, was restricted for the second year in a row due to the coronavirus pandemic.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-among-9-countries-barred-by-saudi-arabia-for-umrah-claims-minister-101628664436705.html

Referring to China's conviction and sentencing of the Canadian businessman as "unacceptable and unjust", Trudeau said that the trial "did not satisfy even the minimum standards required by international law."Spavor was under detention since 2018 under espionage charges. The case has been linked to Beijing's pressure campaign against the Canadian government over the arrest of an executive at tech giant Huawei. The development came a day after the death sentence imposed on another Canadian national was upheld in China.Issuing a statement from his office in Ontario, Trudeau said that the verdict against Spavor came after "more than two and a half years of arbitrary detention" and "a lack of transparency in the legal process"."For Mr. Spavor, as well as for Michael Kovrig who has also been arbitrarily detained, our top priority remains securing their immediate release," Trudeau said in his statement. "We will continue working around the clock to bring them home as soon as possible."Trudeau also added a word for Spavor's kin and promised all help from the federal government in tiding across the difficult time.“Our thoughts, and the thoughts of all Canadians, are with Mr. Spavor and his loved ones during this incredibly difficult time," he said. "The Government of Canada continues to provide consular assistance to Mr. Spavor and his family as we work to secure his safe return."The prime minister of Canada also thanked the nation's allies, partners, and friends for their solidarity and support for the release of Spavor and Kovrig, and their opposition to the "practice of arbitrary detention.""We will not rest until they are safely brought home," Trudeau vowed.Notably, the verdict by the Chinese court today is testing what political commentators have called an already "strained" relationship between Canada and China. Spavor and fellow Canadian ex-diplomat Kovrig were detained in China in what critics labeled “hostage politics” after the executive, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested at the Vancouver airport in late 2018 at the request of US authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unacceptable-unjust-trudeau-fumes-after-china-jails-canadian-man-for-spying-101628661852006.html
11-08-2021||World||Canadian province of Quebec to implement Covid-19 vaccine passports||The Canadian province of Quebec will start recognising Covid-19 vaccine passports or passes from September 1, which will limit the public’s access to certain facilities such as restaurants and gyms.The measure was first announced by Quebec’s premier Francois Legault on August 5, with the rationale forwarded being that those fully vaccinated against Covid-19 should have “a somewhat normal life”. The details of the new system were unveiled by provincial health minister Christian Dubé on Tuesday.It will allow those who have both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine to access non-essential services such as bars, restaurants, sporting facilities and gyms as well as cinemas and public events like concerts and festivals.“The idea is for us to only allow people with the passport to access these services as of September 1, instead of closing them,” said Dube, according to The Montreal Gazette. The vaccine passports or passes will be available on a mobile app that will be launched before September 1, while those without smartphones will be allowed to carry hard copies of proof of vaccination.Two pilot projects are being launched, one at a gym and another one at a sports bar, to test the system before it goes live for the provincial population.“Taking into account the increase in [Covid-19] cases, the fall coming up with back to school and back to work, and the expected prevalence of the Delta variant, the conditions are there to deploy the vaccination passport,” Dubé said, according to the news outlet CBC News.According to Canada’s chief public health officer Theresa Tam, at the “national level, the Delta variant currently accounts for the majority of recently reported VOC (variants of concern) cases”. In a statement, Tam said the latest national seven-day moving average of 1,294 new cases reported daily from August 3 to August 9 was an increase of 58% the previous week. “With early signs of a Delta-driven wave beginning and the fall approaching, efforts to increase the proportion of fully vaccinated Canadians and reinforce individual precautions per local public health advice are crucial to reducing virus spread and lowering the risk of a resurgence that could lead to healthcare capacity being exceeded this coming fall and winter,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-province-of-quebec-to-implement-covid-19-vaccine-passports-101628659708764.html
11-08-2021||World||Germany's train drivers are on a nationwide strike, here's why||Train drivers and railway workers in Germany are on a nationwide strike over wages, news agency AFP reported. The strike began last night around 7pm (local time; it translates to around 10:30pm on Tuesday as per the Indian Standard Time) when the walkout began with cargo trains. Hours later, the strike is scheduled to extend to the passenger train network, the news agency added, noting that only one in four long-distance trains will be in service on Wednesday and Thursday.This is the first strike to hit rail traffic in Germany since December 2018, when a stoppage was called for four hours. The issue has now dealt a blow to summer holidaymakers in Germany and added up to the logistics and supply problems already plaguing the country's industry.Deutsche Bahn (DB), a German railway company that is also one of the largest operators of its type in Europe, blasted the move as an "unnecessary escalation on the back of rail customers"."Just as people are travelling more again and using trains, GDL leaders are destroying the upswing that we urgently need given the huge damage from the coronavirus pandemic," said Martin Seiler, DB board member for human resources and legal affairs.The GDL (Gewerkschaft Deutscher Lokomotivführer), representing workers in train companies, is the trade union that is organising the railway strike. Its leader Claus Weselsky, in turn, accused the DB managers of "lining their pockets while the little guys are getting pockets picked".The union claims to be fighting for better remuneration for train drivers. Its demands include a 1.4 per cent pay hike and a bonus of 600 euros for 2021, and a further wage rise of 1.8 per cent in 2022. The Deutsche Bahn company, on the other hand, has offered to phase in a 3.2-per cent wage increase in two steps but with the intention to apply it in 2022 and 2023.Critics have accused GDL of using the strike to gain greater influence and attract members from larger union EVG -- which covers railway workers and public transport employees. However, Weselsky argued that the GDL "intentionally chose this timeframe in the week to limit the impact on weekend and holiday traffic" and that it was "never the best time" for a strike.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germanys-train-drivers-are-on-a-nationwide-strike-here-s-why-101628651401523.html
11-08-2021||World||Chinese court convicts Canadian Michael Spavor on charge of espionage||A Chinese court sentenced a Canadian tour organiser to 11 years in prison for spying, a ruling that appeared to be timed to show Beijing’s anger over extradition proceedings in Vancouver against Huawei Technologies Co.’s chief financial officer.Michael Spavor, who organised tours to North Korea, was sentenced after being found guilty of stealing and illegally providing state secrets to other countries, the Dandong Intermediate People’s Court said in a statement Wednesday. Spavor had waited for the verdict for five months since a two-hour trial held behind closed doors in March.The court said Spavor would also be deported, without specifying whether it was before or after he served his sentence.The decision was part of a flurry of court proceedings on both sides of this Pacific this week, as Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou made a final push in Vancouver to fight U.S.-led extradition efforts. Spavor is among a handful of Canadians in China facing stiff punishments in the wake of Meng’s December 2018 arrest, which the Communist Party views as a politically motivated attack on one of its chief technology champions.On Tuesday, China upheld a death sentence for Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, who had seen his punishment for drug trafficking increased to death on appeal in January 2019. Canadian Foreign Minister Marc Garneau condemned the decision to reject Schellenberg’s latest appeal and urged Chinese authorities to grant him clemency.Canadian diplomats said they viewed the decisions as politically driven. “I don’t think it’s a coincidence that things are happening right now while events are going on in Vancouver,” Canadian Ambassador Dominic Barton told reporters Tuesday in China.Spavor was detained along with Michael Kovrig -- a Hong Kong-based analyst at the International Crisis Group and former Canadian diplomat -- days after Meng’s arrest and has been jailed ever since. The Canadian side hasn’t received any indication on the timing of Kovrig’s verdict, according to Barton.People convicted of serious violations of the section of law cited by Chinese authorities face between 10 years and life in prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sentences-canadian-national-michael-spavor-to-11-years-in-jail-for-spying-101628650976063.html

Speaking to reporters at the White House Biden stressed that Afghan leaders should "come together" to fight for their country. The Afghan troops outnumber the Taliban and must want to fight... "They've got to fight for themselves, fight for their nation," he said at the media interaction as per Reuters' report.The US President also said that he does not regret his decision to pull out as the Taliban insurgents now expanding their control to over 50 per cent of the country, nearing it to another civil war.Washington has spent more than $1 trillion over 20 years and lost thousands of troops, Biden noted, adding that the United States continues to provide significant air support, food, equipment and salaries to Afghan forces, according to Reuters.Afghans are beginning to realise they have got to come together politically at the top, he also said. "We are going to continue to keep our commitment. But I do not regret my decision."As of Tuesday, Taliban insurgents have gained control of 65 per cent of Afghanistan since the US troops started withdrawing from the country in May this year. The Pentagon says that it has already withdrawn more than 90 per cent of troops from Afghanistan. President Biden has ordered the withdrawal of all the US troops from Afghanistan by September 11.On Tuesday, Pul-e-Khumri northern Afghanistan became the seventh regional capital - the eighth provincial city - to come under the control of the Islamist militants in about a week. It is located at 230 kilometres (140 mi) north of Kabul, the capital city of Afghanistan.In Aibak, a provincial capital between the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif and Kabul, Taliban fighters were moving into government buildings. Most government forces appeared to have withdrawn.For years, the northern region of Afghanistan has remained mostly peaceful. Since now the insurgents are focussing on that region experts say that their strategy seems to be to take the north, and border crossings in the north, west and south, and then close in on Kabul.Earlier, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters the US went to Afghanistan to deliver justice to those who attacked them on September 11, to disrupt terrorists seeking to use Afghanistan as a safe haven to attack the United States. “We achieved those objectives some years ago,” she said. “We judge the threat now against our homeland, which is his responsibility as commander-in-chief to focus on, as being one where the threat emanates from outside of Afghanistan,” she added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/do-not-regret-us-president-rules-out-any-change-to-troop-withdrawal-decision-101628649530148.html

Shahla Abubar, a member of Farah’s provincial council, said local security forces retreated towards an army base outside the city.Five of the other provincial capitals to have fallen since last Friday are in the country’s north with the insurgents now setting their sights on Mazar-i-Sharif, the region’s biggest city. Its fall would signal the total collapse of government control in the traditionally anti-Taliban north.Government forces are also battling the hardline Islamists in Kandahar and Helmand, the southern Pashto-speaking provinces from where the Taliban draw their strength.The US, due to complete a troop withdrawal at the end of the month and end its longest war, has all but left the battlefield. Washington’s special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad is now in Doha, Qatar to try and convince the Taliban leadership to accept a ceasefire.Envoys from hosts Qatar, Britain, China, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, the UN, and European Union were also due to discuss the situation in Afghanistan.But even with a new round of talks in the works, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said it was down to the Afghan government to turn the tide, and there was “not much” the United States could do to help.President Ashraf Ghani called on regional strongmen to support his government, while a UN official said advances made in human rights in the last 20 years were in danger of being erased.Russia showcases arms at drills near Afghan borderSoldiers from Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan used new Russian firearms, flame-throwers and surface-to-air missile launchers in military drills which concluded on Tuesday just 20km from the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border.Moscow and its Central Asian ex-Soviet allies have held two separate sets of military exercises close to Afghanistan this month as Taliban militants overran much of the country’s northern provinces directly adjacent to Central Asia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-taliban-seize-another-provincial-capital-101628647763139.html

Pul-e-Khumri, the capital of Baghlan province in the north, fell after the pro-government militias retreated to Kelagi desert, home to a large Afghan army base.Pul-i-Khumri is on the highway connecting the northern provinces to Kabul. Its fall not only increases pressure on the security forces to keep the Sunni Pashtun fighters away from the country's capital, but also poses a risk of complete isolation of the north of the country.The insurgents have been attacking Kabul over the past few days. On Monday, they threw a grenade at a camp of displaced families in Kabul's District 17, in which three people were injured.Six provincial capitals, mainly in the north of the country, including Kunduz, Taluqan city, Sheberghan, Zaranj, and Samangan province's capital Aybak city were already under Taliban control. Two more - Farah and Baghlan - were captured on Tuesday.The Taliban are also entrenched in Kandahar and Lashkar Gah in the south and outside Faizabad, the capital of Badakhshan, the remote Northern Province that was once considered an anti-Taliban stronghold.The fighters have also increased attacks on the civilians. Three civilians were killed and 18 others injured when a mortar shell struck the Green Hat area in the first district of Ghazni city on Tuesday.UNICEF said in a statement that 27 children have so far been killed and 136 injured in ongoing fighting in Kandahar, Khost and Paktia provinces. The UN agency expressed "shock" at the rapid escalation of grave violations against children in Afghanistan. The International Committee of the Red Cross stressed that hundreds of thousands of civilians are at risk in the country.The Taliban kidnapped a journalist named Nematullah Himmat from his home in Helmand province on Monday. This comes days after Toofan Omari, a journalist and head of radio station Paktia Voice, was shot dead by the insurgents in Kabul.Fighting has intensified on the outskirts of Mazar-e-Sharif, the fourth largest city of Afghanistan and capital of Balkh province. India on Tuesday commenced an evacuation process for its diplomats and nationals from Mazar-e-Sharif, a month after it had undertaken a similar move to move out officials and security persons from the consulate in Kandahar.The Afghan National Security and Defence Forces (ANDSF) are determined to not let the Taliban take Mazar-e-Sharif; they successfully pushed back the insurgents' offensive and regained control over Nahr-e-Shahi, Tolo News reported.Afghanistan is witnessing a surge in violence as the Taliban have intensified their offensive in wake of the pullback of US and Nato forces. These forces will be out of the country by August 31.US President Joe Biden on Tuesday said he does not regret his decision to withdraw American forces from Afghanistan amid the Taliban offensive and urged the leaders of the war-torn country to unite and "fight for their nation".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-target-civilians-in-afghanistan-in-push-towards-kabul-101628646567018.html

11-08-2021||India||Kejriwal, Sisodia given clean chit in ex-chief secretary assault case||A Delhi court on Wednesday exonerated chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, his deputy Manish Sisodia, and nine Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs over the alleged assault on the former Delhi chief secretary (CS) Anshu Prakash during a midnight meeting in 2018, ruling that there was no “unlawful assembly” or “criminal conspiracy” that led to the incident.“…There was no prior meeting of minds, prior concert, conspiracy or pre-meditation amongst the accused persons to commit any offence against the complainant (Prakash),” the court said in its verdict.In his police complaint in February 2018, Prakash alleged that Kejriwal, Sisodia, and 11 AAP MLAs assaulted him in a midnight meeting called by the CM’s former adviser VK Jain on February 19, 2018, to discuss release of the party’s advertisements related to the government completing three years in Delhi.Prakash alleged that he was manhandled and assaulted in the course of the meeting.Metropolitan magistrate Sachin Gupta ruled that the incident happened suddenly, after some of the MLAs started questioning Prakash over some issues and in the spur of the moment, and two of the MLAs — Amanatullah Khan and Parkash Jarwal -- allegedly assaulted him without any conspiracy or pre-meditation.“During the course of a meeting called by the Chief Minister, whose own conduct is not suspicious at all, if something untoward allegedly happened, that itself does not render the meeting an unlawful assembly or does not make the presence of CM, deputy CM and other accused MLAs as part of or acting under a criminal conspiracy or sharing common intention or even abetting in any manner, commission of alleged offence,” the court said. It also refused to make anything of the fact that the meeting was scheduled at midnight. It said that labelling a meeting called by the CM at his residence, attended by his deputy and eleven other MLAs, as unlawful assembly or part of any criminal conspiracy, “can seriously hamper the smooth functioning of the government and public interest would suffer ultimately”.The court added that if Prakash had felt any threat to his life, he would have raised an alarm and certainly called his PSO (personal security officer) immediately after he came out of the meeting room , which he did not do, and this conduct speaks volume.It also said that Prakash neither made a call to 100 (police helpline) nor lodged the police complaint immediately thereafter, clearly demonstrating that there was no threat to his life.The court, however, framed charges against Khan and Jarwal for obstructing a public servant on duty, assaulting him, and voluntarily causing hurt to him, taking note of the statement by Jain.Soon after the verdict was passed, Kejriwal tweeted: “Satyamev Jayate” (truth will prevail).Sisodia told reporters that the whole case was a conspiracy by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which was scared of Kejriwal’s popularity. “A false police case was made against him by the BJP which misused its power in the central government. Delhi Police reports to them,” he claimedA Delhi BJP spokesperson dismissed these charges as “baseless” and contended that the CM and deputy CM were exonerated only due to “lack of evidence”.Delhi Police, which probed the incident, filed a 1,300-page charge sheet on August 13, 2018, against 13 AAP leaders -- including Kejriwal and Sisodia -- for offences including criminal conspiracy, assaulting a public servant, threatening to cause death or grievous injury, and wrongful confinement.On Wednesday, the court said that there was no evidence to suggest that the accused persons perpetrated or abetted the crime. “There is also no material available on record to infer that the alleged act of assault and intimidation by some of the accused persons present there was done in furtherance of common intention of all present there or that there was any pre-arranged plan or prior meeting of minds or prior concert amongst the accused persons present there,” the court added.The judge also said that just because the meeting was at midnight, it did “not give rise to the proposition that it was under a pre-planned conspiracy,” the court said.“Hence, plea..the meeting was intentionally scheduled at midnight under a preplanned conspiracy, whereas no such issue was raised during the day time meetings, which he attended with the Chief Minister and Deputy CM, is also not sustainable,” it added.The court noted the statement of CM’s former advisor VK Jain, who said that the MLAs started aggressively questioning Prakash on several topics. Jain added in his statement that he went to the washroom, and when he came back, he saw two of the MLAs -- Khan and Jarwal -- pushing Prakash, and putting their hands on his chin. He added that the CM asked them to refrain from doing so, and was unhappy with the conduct of the MLAs.The judge also did not accept the allegation that specific MLAs were chosen by the CM and deputy CM for the purpose of the meeting. He said that they had all gathered on the CM’s directions to discuss various issues, including doorstep delivery of ration, TV advertisements, etc, and hence “referring to those MLAs as ‘specific MLAs’ chosen for some ‘specific purpose’, does not make any sense and does not fortify the theory of conspiracy, as portrayed”.The court said that Prakash had the option of putting a dissent note over the issues being discussed, and that he was not the final authority on any of them.Taking note of the statements of two witnesses, former North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NrDMC) chief Varsha Joshi and the then managing director of DTTDC Shurbir Singh, the court noted that even on February 12, the CM firmly asked Prakash to complete the work. The high court on August 24 last yeardirected the trial court to only pass orders on the charges levelled by the police, and not on any other issues. This was after Kejriwal challenged an order of the trial court allowing a Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) to represent him in court On October 22, 2018, a city court had allowed Prakash to have an SPP instead of a regular public prosecutor to represent him in court. On November 20, 2018, the CM and his deputy had moved court challenging this order following which the order was stayed on March 14, 2019. The matter would be now heard on September 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwal-sisodia-given-clean-chit-in-ex-chief-secretary-assault-case-101628705190701.html
11-08-2021||India||Amarinder meets PM, urges him to repeal three farm laws||New Delhi/Chandigarh: Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to immediately initiate steps for the repeal of three controversial farm laws, arguing that the prolonged stir by farmers could have national security implications. The chief minister, who met the PM in Delhi on Wednesday evening, submitted two separate letters, one calling for the immediate review and revocation of the three farm laws passed last year and another asking for legal aid for cultivators. “In my meeting with Prime Minister @narendramodi ji today, have urged upon him for initiating immediate steps to revoke farm laws which have triggered resentment amongst farmers. Have also requested him to amend the relevant law to provide free legal services to farmers,” Singh tweeted after the meeting. The CM, who shares a stormy relationship with longstanding rival and Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, met party chief Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday. He also met Union home minister Amit Shah and demanded 25 Central Armed Police Force (CAPF) for Punjab and anti-drone gadgets for BSF.Over a dozen farm unions, especially from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, are protesting the three laws by sit-in demonstrations outside the Capital. Cultivators say the laws will leave them at the mercy of large corporations and jeopardise their livelihoods. They have also said the new laws would lead to the dismantling of a system of MSP. The government has billed the laws as necessary reforms to modernise India’s farming sector deemed largely unproductive. and has refused to repeal them. Despite 11 rounds of talks -- the last one was held on January 22 – there has been no point of agreement between the government and the farmers. The government offered to freeze the laws for 18 months, a proposal the farmers rejected.  At the meeting, Singh said around 400 farmers and farm workers had died in the protest, according to the official statement by the state government after the meeting. He argued that the stir had the potential of posing security threats for Punjab and the country with Pakistan-backed anti-India forceslooking to exploit the farmers’ disgruntlement, according to government press release. He also urged the PM to intervene and redress the farmers’ legitimate concerns. The CM said the continued agitation was not only impacting economic activities in Punjab but also had the potential to affect the state’s social fabric. He further underlined the need to compensate farmers for the management of paddy straw @ Rs.100 per quintal and address the fears of D-ammonium phosphate (DAP) fertilizer shortage. In another letter, the CM stressed that due to the fragmentation of landholdings, and persistent disputes with lessees and various market operators and agents, farmers were facing heightened litigation, causing stress on their meagre financial resources. He said that there was a need to reduce the farmer’s ’ financial burden due to litigation and noted that the Central Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 provides free legal aid to certain categories of people, according to government’s official statement.“It is, thus, the need of the hour to amend Section 12 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, to include farmers and farm workers in the category of persons entitled to free legal services to pursue and defend themselves in the courts to secure their livelihood,” Singh told the PM, according to official press release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-meets-pm-urges-him-to-repeal-three-farm-laws-101628704835737.html

However, Dhankar described his meeting as a “courtesy” call.“WB Governor Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar called on the Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi at Parliament House office @PMOIndia,” Dhankhar tweeted around 8 pm and posted a photograph.Modi was in the Parliament to attend the last day of the monsoon session of the Lok Sabha.The meeting made Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC), which shares an acrimonious relationship with Dhankhar, take apotshot at him.“We don’t know why the governor met the Prime Minister.

He did not elaborate.Raj Bhawan officials said Dhankhar did not specify how long he will stay in the national capital and whether he will meet Union home minister Amit Shah.During his earlier trips to Delhi, the governor met Shah and submitted reports on law and order situation in the state.The governor has been extremely vocal on political violence since the March-April assembly polls."Probably he informed the Prime Minister about the ongoing political violence.

Dhami made the request during a courtesy meeting with Shah in Delhi.Dhami told Shah that thought there was one AIIMS in Rishikesh, but due to difficult hilly terrain, people in far-flung areas of the state are missing out on super-specialty healthcare. “If an AIIMS is set up in Kumaon, it will not only cater to the people of the region but also to those living in bordering districts of Uttar Pradesh. Dhami said land will be provided for AIIMS by the state government, said a statement issued by the state government.Dhami also requested Shah for help in establishing an Indian Science Education and Research Institute in Dehradun.Earlier in the day, Dhami met defence minister Rajnath Singh in Delhi and urged him to recommend conversion of the proposed Tanakpur-Bageshwar narrow gauge railway line into broad gauge by the Railways keeping in mind tourism potential and strategic concerns.“The proposed narrow gauge will not address the basic requirements, transport problems or the strategic concerns in the area. As the area is near Nepal and China, rail-line in this area has significant strategic importance. So, this narrow gauge should be changed to broad gauge. The rain line will also link new trade centres in the region”, he saidThe chief minister also requested Singh that the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed with Uttarakhand for the proposed Military School at Jakholi in Rudraprayag district, be amended to include financial assistance for development of infrastructural facilities there.Dhami has already met Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Union minister of state for tourism and defence Ajay Bhatt, Rajya Sabha MP from Uttarakhand Anil Baluni and Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat since arriving in Delhi on Tuesday.Dhami was assured during his meeting with Shekhawat that the Centre will soon sanction ₹4,673 crore for the 300 MW Lakhwad multi-purpose project located on Yamuna river in Dehradun district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-cm-meets-amit-shah-with-request-for-an-aiims-in-kumaon-region-101628703375934.html

Police also found the child’s clothes and some other items associated with religious rituals from the bank of the river.“The recovery of the body and other items led us to suspect that it could be a case of witchcraft or human sacrifice. Our teams questioned several people and finally the victim’s father and a local priest have been arrested for involvement in the child’s murder,” Singh said.The victim’s father and the priest were co-workers at the Safrai tea garden and were very close. The victim’s father also used to work as a part time help in the priest’s house, police said.“Both accused have confessed to their involvement in the murder. Preliminary investigation revealed that the priest claimed to have dreamt that he had some incurable illness, which could be cured only with the sacrifice of a child. He disclosed this to the victim’s father who decided to help him by offering his own child for the sacrificial ritual,” said Singh.The duo strangled the victim and threw her body in the river, from where it was recovered and sent for post-mortem. Further investigation was underway and more people could be arrested, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-4-year-old-girl-allegedly-sacrificed-two-including-father-arrested-101628701692805.html
11-08-2021||India||Opposition walks out of Rajya Sabha, govt wants special committee probe||The government on Wednesday said a special Rajya Sabha committee should investigate all incidents of protest and indiscipline by Member of Parliaments (MPs) from Opposition parties in the Upper House during the monsoon session.Leader of the House Piyush Goyal said the protests that saw some Opposition MPs tear papers, fling files and manhandle the marshals in the House cannot be tolerated. “Just as a special committee was set up in the Lok Sabha, a similar committee should be constituted to carry out an investigation (into the protests in Rajya Sabha),” he said.Shortly before the Upper House was adjourned sine die, Opposition MPs staged a walkout following a ruckus. They objected to the presence of security personnel during the passage of the insurance amendment Bill. The opposition has been accusing the government of putting key bills to vote without discussions amid din in the Parliament.Leader of the Opposition (LoP) Mallikarjun Kharge said there were more marshals then members present in the house. He said marshals had manhandled some of the women MPs and women were not safe even within Parliament.Speaking in the House, Goyal said the protesting MPs violated all Covid protocols while protesting in the well of the House. He said the disruptions were “pre- planned” and claimed that an opposition leader was quoted to have said that the aim was to ensure that the session was a washout, and that another one had said that no matter how hard the government tries the session will not be allowed to work till August 13.“When the government agreed to have a discussion on all the issues raised by the Opposition there were no chances of a washout so eventually the Opposition kept changing its stand. There was competitive opposition on how to disrupt the house,” he said. Goyal went on to say that on the day when India was observing the anniversary of the Quit India movement, the opposition continued to disturb the house and their behaviour “will be recorded in black letters.”He also took potshots at the Congress and said the party did not even attend the all-party meeting chaired by the Prime Minister on the issue of Covid crisis.Objecting to how the bills were passed, Congress MP Jairam Ramesh tweeted, “Insurance Amendment Bill to privatise GIC was passed in RS with a large force of security personnel present. The Govt refused to send it to a Select Committee — a demand by all Opposition parties including those close to BJP. What happened this evening was worse than atrocious!”CPI’s Binoy Visvam also tweeted, “A black day for parliament. They have virtually made it a military barrack. Brute force was used against members including women. What was our crime? We opposed the insurance bill. It, in fact was insurance annihilation Bill. 'Atmanirbhar BJP' has surrendered India to capitalists.”Congress MPs Phulo Devi Netam and Chayya Varma alleged that they were pushed around by male marshals. They told media persons outside the House that the marshals did not show respect even to women MPs.Parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said there was CCTV footage to prove that some Opposition MPs attempted manhandling inside the house. He said the government will give a request in writing to the Rajya Sabha chairperson to set up a committee to take strict action against the Opposition MPs who indulged in such behaviour.On the last day of the session, the Upper House passed the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Bill, 2021 to restore the states’ powers to have their own list of OBCs for reservation in jobs in educational institutions.The House also passed the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Amendment Bill, 2021 without discussion and amid sloganeering by the Opposition MPs. The Bill seeks to provide greater private participation in the public sector insurance companies. Earlier, the Opposition parties had demanded that the bill be referred to a select committee of the House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-walks-out-of-rajya-sabha-govt-wants-special-committee-probe-101628700367589.html
11-08-2021||India||As UK relaxes curbs, 19 per cent increase in admission of Indian students||The number of Indian students taking admission into UK university and higher education courses has increased 19 per cent in 2021 as the United Kingdom moves India from its Red list to the Amber list. According to the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service acceptance figures, released a day after the UK moved India from the red list to the amber list, a record number of 3,200 students have been accepted onto UK institutions, news agency PTI reported.Until August 8, India was on the Red List of the United Kingdom's advisory. People travelling to the United Kingdom from a red-listed country will have to book a quarantine hotel package, while passengers from amber-list countries can quarantine at any place. The National Indian Students and Alumni Union, UK, was pushing the government to upgrade India's status as the hotel quarantine will cost 1,750 pounds. The red list rules also say passengers from red list countries will only be allowed to enter the UK if they have residence rights in the UK or are British or Irish nationals.Though students who have got admission to UK varsities might have been allowed to enter the country, the additional cost of a government-managed facility for 10 days would have added to the financial burden.“We know India being moved from the Red to Amber list will be a significant and welcome move for those Indian students due to travel to the UK soon. Those students should stay in touch with their university and be aware of the latest procedure for amber list arrivals to ensure a smooth arrival,” Vivienne Stern, Director of Universities UK International, which represents over 140 universities, told PTI.Air India has recently announced non-stop flights to London from six Indian cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Amritsar and Kochi between August 16 and September 1.Though India has been moved to the amber list, Pakistan is still on the Red list, which has led to diplomatic push from Pakistan. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's special assistant Dr Faisa Sultan has written to the UK health secretary explaining how Pakistan has the lowest daily Covid surge in the region. As the listing is a dynamic process, Pakistan may be moved to the amber list in future.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-uk-relaxes-curbs-19-per-cent-increase-in-admission-of-indian-students-101628698988059.html

"Government gives me a pension but it's insufficient. Government should look after the artists who have earned respect for the country," the singer said.Media reports of Pagdhare facing penury have been doing the rounds. The singer told reporters that her monthly pension of ₹3,150 is not only insufficient but also never reaches on time, and her financial troubles have been exacerbated by the lack of royalty payments for her cult hit song. Pagdhare urged chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and PM Modi to help out artists by raising the monthly pension.With theatres and performance spaces shutting down due to Covid-19, artists have fallen into particularly hard times. On August 5, the Maharashtra government announced a ₹34 crore relief package for folk music artists, producers of folk art, touring talkies and organisations associated with them to help them overcome the impact of the pandemic coupled with the lockdown. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray okayed this package after meeting with the state’s culture minister Amit Deshmukh. The chief minister's Office (CMO) said 56,000 folk artists will receive a grant of ₹5,000 each as financial assistance. This relief package is expected to cost the state exchequer Rs.28 crore. Maharashtra is slowly starting to ease Covid-induced restrictions but the state health minister Rajesh Tope said on Wednesday that theatres and multiplexes will remain shut until further orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/itni-shakti-hame-dena-daata-singer-urges-pm-modi-maharashtra-government-for-financial-help-101628698545191.html

11-08-2021||India||In a first in 40 years, ULFA-I not to boycott Independence Day celebrations||For the first time in its 42-year-old history, the banned United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I) has decided not to boycott the Independence Day celebrations this year or call for a shutdown on the occasion.In a statement released on Wednesday, Rumel Asom, a member of the outfit’s publicity wing, also expressed willingness to talk to the Centre on the question of Assam’s sovereignty. HT has seen a copy of the two-page statement written in Assamese.“In view of the Covid-19 situation….and other problems like flood, erosion and unemployment affecting indigenous populations, ULFA-I has refrained itself this time from armed protest of the fake Independence Day of colonial India or called for a ‘bandh’,” the statement read.Since its inception in 1979 with the aim of an armed struggle to create an independent Assam, ULFA has been boycotting Independence Day and Republic Day celebrations and indulged in violent activities on those days.Though it refrained from issuing a boycott call this time, the outfit asked the public to protest against Independence Day celebrations by wearing black badges, flying the ULFA-I flag and other means while following Covid-19 protocols.“Our organization is not against talks or belligerent. But it is not possible to deny historic facts or waver from our ideological goals in the name of talks. Indian authorities have maintained that talks with ULFA-I can’t include the question of (Assam’s) sovereignty,” the statement added.The statement cited the Treaty of Yandaboo, 1826 signed between the king of Myanmar (Burma) and the British, which ended Myanmar’s claim on Assam and Manipur, to claim Assam has always been “independent and autonomous”.ULFA-I sought “restoration of sovereignty on historical facts” as a pre-condition for talks with the Centre.“The constitution of India has been amended nearly 100 times. Why can’t it be amended again to allow for talks with ULFA-I? If India wants talks, it should amend the constitution to approve the right to secede by communities or allow a plebiscite participated by bonafide indigenous communities,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-in-40-years-ulfa-i-not-to-boycott-independence-day-celebrations-101628696505836.html

11-08-2021||India||India to join meeting on Afghanistan situation in Qatar on Thursday||India is set to participate in a meeting of key countries being hosted by Qatar on Thursday to discuss the situation in Afghanistan against the backdrop of the Taliban’s massive offensive that has already resulted in the fall of nine provincial capitals.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that India will be represented at the meeting in Doha that will also be joined by nations such as Indonesia and Turkey, which is set to take over the security of Bagram airbase.There was no official word on the matter from the external affairs ministry and the people cited above were tight-lipped about the level of India’s participation. The invitation to join the meeting was extended by Mutlaq bin Majed Al-Qahtani, Qatar’s special envoy for counter-terrorism and conflict resolution, when he visited New Delhi last week.Qatar on Wednesday hosted a meeting of the “extended troika” that was convened by Russia and was joined by the US special envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, and his counterparts from Russia, China and Pakistan.On Tuesday, Qatar had hosted a meeting of representatives from China, the US, the UK, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, the UN and the European Union (EU) to assess the rapidly evolving situation in Afghanistan.The focus of these meetings is on reviving the stalled Afghan peace process amid the Taliban’s campaign of violence and attacks that has already resulted in the fall of nine provincial capitals in just five days – Sheberghan, Sari Pul, Aybak, Kunduz, Taluqan, Pul-e-Khumri, Farah, Zaranj and Faizabad.India has already said any forcible takeover of Kabul will not be legitimate and backed calls for a negotiated political settlement that preserves the gains under a democratic system over the past two decades and ensures the rights of minorities, women and ethnic groups.New Delhi also advised all Indian nationals in Afghanistan on Tuesday to make immediate arrangements to return home as it evacuated some 50 officials and security personnel from the consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif. According to figures provided by the government to Parliament last week, some 1,500 Indian nationals are currently in Afghanistan.During a meeting with Al-Qahtani in New Delhi on Saturday, external affairs minister S Jaishankar expressed concern at the rapid deterioration of the security situation in Afghanistan. Jaishankar also shared concerns from across the region about the situation in the wake of the Taliban’s campaign to capture urban centres after taking over wide swathes of territory in rural areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-join-meeting-on-afghanistan-situation-in-qatar-on-thursday-101628695310050.html
11-08-2021||India||No, Kerala does not have any new variant of Covid, clarifies health ministry||Around 88 to 90 per cent of Covid cases in Kerala are driven by Variant of Concern Delta, but no new variant has been found in Kerala, the Union health ministry clarified refuting some media reports. "The news about new variants suspected in Kerala is without any basis and absolutely false," the ministry said. Continuing its upward trend, the state, which is the main cause for concern in India now, recorded 23,500 fresh Covid cases on Wednesday.A six-member central team recently visited a few worst-hit districts of the state and submitted a report to the Centre. In the report, several factors including laxity in containment, a higher percentage of elderly and diabetic population etc., have been pointed out. The team has also sought more information regarding the cases of reinfections, Dr Sujeet Singh, director of the National Centre for Disease Control said.15,000 Covid reinfections in Kerala district? 10 findings of Central teamWhile the state government has been quick to announce measures for fresh restrictions, mandating either vaccination certificate or negative RT-PCR report for visiting shops, the health ministry on Tuesday said that the daily cases may go up in the state as the state has a high reproductive rate and low seroprevalence. If crowding takes place during the upcoming Onam, the situation will take a more concerning turn, the ministry said. Meanwhile, the state government has barred any gathering for Onam festivities.According to data, submitted by the district authorities to the Central team, Kerala's Patnamthitta has reported 14,974 cases of reinfections. Among these reinfection cases, 5,042 are those who have been vaccinated with both doses, as claimed by the district authorities. The central team said it is probing into the reason for these breakthrough cases. The Covid situation of the country has been stabilising in July-August, while Kerala is steadily contributing the maximum to India's daily caseload.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-kerala-does-not-have-any-new-variant-of-covid-clarifies-health-ministry-101628692599645.html
11-08-2021||India||Singapore deputy PM for greater economic integration between India and Asean||India should consider greater economic integration with Southeast Asia, including through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), to unlock the country’s full potential, Singapore’s deputy prime minister Heng Swee Keat said on Wednesday.Heng, who is also the coordinating minister for economic policies, made the remarks while addressing the opening session of the Confederation of Indian Industry’s virtual annual meeting against the backdrop of concerns among Southeast Asian nations about lack of focus in India’s economic ties with the region.He noted that the Indian government has itself recognised that “a self-reliant India is not an insular India”, and said the “door remains open” for India to join RCEP when it is ready. At the same time, Heng said, India has an important role to play in contributing to the diversification of the global supply chain and making it more resilient.Heng made three broad points in his speech – relations between India and Singapore have been propelled by steps such as the signing of the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) in 2005, the potential to collaborate in new areas such as fintech and sustainability, and the importance of collaborating with Southeast Asia.“The importance of collaboration to unlock India’s vast potential means that India should consider greater economic integration with the region,” he said. While acknowledging that globalisation comes with costs, Heng said if India can address “these downsides well – through reform, transformation and attracting new investments – it will be in a good position to ride the post-Covid wave of globalisation”.Describing RCEP as an “important regional agreement”, Heng said it comprises the ten Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) members and five major trading partners and is the “largest agreement of its kind in history”. He added, “We fully appreciate why India is unable to join the RCEP at this moment. But the door remains open, and we welcome India to do so when you are ready.”Asean and Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea signed RCEP last November. Japan led the drafting of a declaration that left the door open for India to join the world's largest trading bloc, covering nearly a third of the global economy, at a later stage. Indian officials have said the country didn’t join RCEP because it would have had negative consequences, including China using the trade deal to get unfettered access to the vast Indian market at the cost of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), farmers and start-ups.Heng contended that the campaign for a self-reliant India is also about building a “stronger and more cohesive” country and said India must work with partners beyond its shores in a world disrupted by Covid-19.“India has an important role to play in contributing to the diversification of the global supply chain and making it more resilient,” he said. “Indian companies have the capability, scale and resources to serve more than just its domestic market, huge as it is.”He said there are tremendous opportunities for India to partner economies in Southeast Asia, with the ASEAN-India Free Trade Area established more than a decade ago helping to almost double two-way trade. “Asean and India have many complementary strengths. We should build on these to restore connectivity, and enhance supply chains in the post-pandemic era,” he said.Heng, who was Singapore’s chief negotiator for CECA, also said Singapore has been India’s largest source of FDI in recent years, with direct investment growing 50 times to $45 billion. He also highlighted recent cooperation between the two sides on the Covid-19 response, including India keeping the supply chain for essential goods open early in the crisis, and Singapore sending oxygen-related supplies when India experienced its second wave of infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/singapore-deputy-pm-for-greater-economic-integration-between-india-and-asean-101628692251794.html
11-08-2021||India||These states in India offer best quality of life for elderly||The government on Wednesday released an index to measure the quality of life led by the elderly in India. The study was released by Bibek Debroy who is the chairman of the economic advisory committee of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The study carried out by the Institute for Competitiveness aims to reflect upon the problems faced by the elderly.The study identifies the overall ageing situation of India and focuses on the regional patterns of ageing across states and Union Territories. The study found out that Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Chandigarh are states which lead in the categories - aged states, relatively aged states, northeastern states and Union Territories.The framework of the index included four pillars: financial well-being, social well-being, health system and income security. It also included eight sub-pillars: economic empowerment, educational attainment and employment, social status, physical security, basic health, psychological well being, social security and enabling environment.The study revealed that states and Union Territories have poorly performed in the income security parameter. The states scored below the national average of 33.03 in the case of income security. The financial well-being index also performed poorly (44.7) owing to the low performance of 21 states in the educational attainment and employment pillar.It also highlighted that the highest average was scored by the health system pillar across India with a score of 66.97 followed by 62.34 in social well being.Among all the states, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh are top-scoring regions in the aged states and relatively aged states categories. Rajasthan has a score of 54.61 in the aged states category while Himachal Pradesh has a score of 61.04 in relatively aged states. Mizoram has a score of 59.79 among northeastern states while Chandigarh scored 63.78 among the Union Territories.Jammu and Kashmir scored the lowest 46.16 among Union Territories. Arunachal Pradesh, among the northeastern states, scored the lowest score with 46.16. In the aged states and relatively aged states categories, Telangana and Gujarat scored the lowest with 38.19 and 49.00, respectively.Debroy said that the nation faces an ageing and greying problem. “India is often portrayed as a young society, with a consequent demographic dividend. But, as with every country that goes through a fast process of demographic transition, India also has a greying and ageing problem. EAC-PM requested Dr Amit Kapoor and his team at Institute for Competitiveness to do a report on an issue that is often not mentioned which are problems faced by the elderly,” Debroy was quoted as saying in a release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/these-states-in-india-offer-best-quality-of-life-for-elderly-101628690573107.html

11-08-2021||India||The curious case of an ATS in Karnataka; no case, no investigation||Sixteen years after the first terror attack on the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), the first terrorist attack in Bengaluru, Karnataka now has three different anti-terrorism squads with the third being added last year. Even though Bengaluru has witnessed three major terror attacks since the IISc attack on December 28, 2005, one of the ATS units has a peculiar track record of not being part of any of the terror-related investigations.At present Karnataka Police operates three the Anti-Terror Squads (ATS) and they come under three different departments within the police force -- the Internal Security Division, State Intelligence Department and the Central Crime Branch. The third ATS unit under Central Crime Branch was added last year.The ATS which comes under the Internal Security Division -- has a unique track record. The unit has neither registered a single FIR nor has it investigated any terror case since its formation in 2009 following the 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai. Similar units were raised by the Maharashtra and New Delhi Police as well.Like their counterparts, ATS had the mandate of being the state police’s nodal agency for all counter-terror operations in the state. However, unlike Mumbai and New Delhi, ATS was not given any powers to register FIRs and investigate terror-related cases in Karnataka, officials, requesting anonymity said.Since the formation of the ATS under the Internal Security Division, Bengaluru witnessed three major terror strikes – the 2010 Chinnaswamy stadium blast, the 2013 BJP headquarters blast and the 2014 Church Street blast. Even though ATS was the nodal agency for counter-terrorism, all three cases were investigated by the local police or Central Crime Branch.According to the records of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), 15 people have been arrested in Karnataka since 2014 for their alleged connection with Islamic State (IS) agents. The state intelligence records show that 30 people have been arrested so far in the state, for radicalisation and having links with members of the IS.The arrest of Mehdi Masroor Biswas, an engineer who allegedly ran a pro-Islamic State Twitter handle, in 2014, has been one of the biggest catches for the Bengaluru police. In its charge sheet, the police claimed that Biswas would monitor the developments of IS on the internet and television and assist his followers, who were willing to enter the IS territory.Even in these cases, the investigations were carried out by local police and Central Crime Branch.Two officers who served in the ISD’s ATS referred to the unit as a paper tiger. According to one officer, the job of the ATS, despite being the nodal agency for counter-terrorism, was to collect memos from central agencies and pass them to relevant units. “In my time in the unit, we have not done any investigation or any serious intelligence collection for that matter. We took inputs from different units and send them across. This job was done by the intelligence department also,” said one of the officers, who didn’t want to disclose his identity.The second officer said that a posting in the unit could be perceived as a “punishment” or “soft posting”, depending on the officer. “How can ATS be a nodal agency, when the officers from different ATS units go directly to Bengaluru police or the CCB for inputs? This unit is certainly not doing the job its counterparts are doing,” said the officer who had worked briefly in the unit.Karnataka police chief, DG&IGP Praveen Sood said that even though the state has three different ATS units their roles are well defined. “Last year we have started the ATS in the Bengaluru police since the city had witnessed multiple terror attacks in the past. This unit comes under the Central Crime Branch (CCB). For the other two agencies, their role is to provide intelligence and inputs. ATS (ISD) liaisons with NIA and IB (Intelligence Bureau),” said Sood.Despite the police chief's claim that the roles are well-defined, officers in the ISD’s ATS are still unclear about their role, as the intelligence on counter-terrorism is handled by state intelligence and investigations are handled by either Central Crime Branch or local police.On Tuesday, newly appointed Karnataka home minister Araga Jnanendra told the top brass of the department to give more powers to the ISD. An officer who was part of the meeting however said that apart from the single instruction, no detailed propositions were made by the home minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-ats-hasn-t-solved-one-case-filed-one-fir-since-formation-101628684010124.html

Speaking at an annual session of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), PM Modi said Indian start-ups have the same level of self-confidence as displayed by Indian athletes and sportspersons at Tokyo Olympics.“When today's youth of India come out on the field, they don't have any hesitancy in their minds. They want to work hard and take risks. They want to yield results. Yes, we belong to this place - we see this emotion in our youth today,” he said.PM Modi highlighted the collaboration between the government and the Indian industries to make available face masks, PPE kits, and other essential supplies needed to fight the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.

11-08-2021||India||Anguished Naidu breaks down over ‘acts of sacrilege’ in RS||Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday broke down as he expressed “deep anguish” over “acts of sacrilege” by some MPs, a day after Opposition lawmakers protesting against the contentious farm laws stormed the well of the House, sat on its table and even climbed it. “The Parliament, the apex legislature of our country is regarded as the temple of democracy. The table area where the officers and reporters of the House, the secretary general and the presiding officer are seated, is considered the holy sanctum sanctorum of the House. A certain degree of sacredness is attached to this place,” Naidu said. He said he was distressed by the way that sacredness was destroyed on Tuesday. Unruly scenes played out in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday as the Opposition ratcheted up its protests against the farm laws during a short duration discussion on agricultural problems and solutions. Also Watch | Rajya Sabha chairman in tears after MPs climb tables & throw files“In our temples, devotees are allowed only up to the sanctum sanctorum and not beyond. Entering this sanctum sanctorum of the House in itself is an act of sacrilege and it has been happening as routine over the years…While some members sat on the table, some others climbed on the table of the House, perhaps to be more visible with such acts of sacrilege. I have no words to convey my anguish and to condemn such acts,” the chairperson said. Breaking down, he said he spent a sleepless night on Tuesday struggling to find the provocation or reason for forcing the House to hit a new low. He said the short duration discussion on agricultural problems and solutions was a “golden opportunity” for the members protesting against the farm laws to have gone on record with their position on issues relating to the plight of the farmers. He said right at the start of the proceedings of the House on Tuesday, he had cautioned that not taking up the listed discussion on farm sector issues would send out a negative message that the House is not interested in discussing the problems of India’s bread givers. “Unfortunately, it went unheeded. In the process, some sections of the House have inflicted incalculable damage to the dignity and stature of this House. As the chairman, I am deeply distressed over it and so is the nation,” Naidu said. He pointed out that it was worrisome that some members shot the “sad moments of sacrilege in the House” on their phones and posted it on social media. “While doing so, they only ended up showing to the people the extent to which this august House can degenerate due to the new-found competitive and aggressive disruptions by some sections,” he said. He appealed to the “collective conscience of this House” to seriously reflect on what happened and explore remedies, if any. “Failure to do so would certainly render our parliamentary democracy irrelevant. I would like to remind all of you that we begin to celebrate the 75th year of our Independence in a few days from now. The choice before each one of you is very clear. It is either to be the best parliamentarian or the worst disruptor,” he added. The Opposition, however, continued with its protests against the farm laws, forcing an adjournment after Naidu made his observations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anguished-naidu-breaks-down-over-acts-of-sacrilege-in-rs-101628679991930.html
11-08-2021||India||India-UAE flights: Why passengers have to reach airport 5-6 hours before departure||As India-UAE flights have resumed from August 7 under specific guidelines, airlines have started issuing directives for the passengers. Air India's subsidiary Air India Express on Wednesday issued guidelines asking passengers to reach the airports six hours in advance. A similar directive was issued by IndiGo earlier. The UAE has mandated a negative PCR test of every passenger conducted not more than four hours before the flight. Because of this time stipulation, the tests have to be done at the source airports. "The teat counters will start 4 hours before the departure time and would close 2 hours prior to departure," the Air India Express said, asking flyers to reach the airports at least six hours prior to the scheduled departure.#FlyWithIX: Attention passengers traveling to UAE from India!@IndembAbuDhabi @cgidubai pic.twitter.com/O74tVx3dueThis test is mandatory not only for passengers from India but also from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. This is the reason why many Pakistani fliers were stranded as there was no rapid PCR test facility in Pakistan airports. While Pakistan civil authorities said they were negotiating with the UAE authorities, reports said that Pakistan's Sialkot international airport has introduced a rapid PCR test facility which will be available from August 12.After banning all passengers from India, including UAE residents, the UAE government in the first week of August decided to allow partial relaxation to Indian flyers. Apart from allowing transit passengers, the UAE also allowed UAE residents with residence proof, students, medical professionals and professionals working for the UAE government or government agencies.UAE's national carrier Etihad Airways has updated its guidelines for passengers and said that UAE residents flying to Abu Dhabi from India must quarantine at home for 12 days. "When you arrive in Abu Dhabi, you will be required to quarantine for 12 days and wear a medically approved wristband for the duration of your quarantine," the revised protocol read. The passengers will also have to take a PCR test on arrival, on day six and day eleven.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiauae-flights-why-passengers-have-to-reach-airport-5-6-hours-before-departure-101628679671334.html
11-08-2021||India||Man from Bhatkal held for terror links; wave of arrests sounds IS alarm in south India||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday arrested a man from Karnataka’s Bhatkal town in connection with terror activities of a group propagating the violent ideology of the Islamic State (IS), making it the third arrest in as many days from the state, an official said. The accused has been identified as Zufri Jawhar Damudi of Bhatkal town in Uttara Kannada district. On Wednesday, NIA arrested Ammar Abdul Rahman of Mangalore and Shankar Venkatesh Perumal of Bengaluru in connection with the case after conducting simultaneous searches in Jammu and Kashmir and Karnataka. According to the central agency, Damudi is alleged to have created fake identities on different chat platforms to communicate with people and was involved in radicalising and recruiting youths to join the group. With these arrests, the total number of IS sympathizers arrested from Karnataka till date has gone up to 15. In October 2019, NIA inspector general Alok Mittal announced that the central agency had arrested 127 IS sympathizers from across India between 2014 and 2019. According to the NIA list at the time, maximum 33 people have been arrested from Tamil Nadu, followed by Uttar Pradesh (19), Kerala (17), Telangana (14), Maharashtra (12) and Karnataka (8). Since 2019, as per the information listed on NIA’s website, three IS-related cases have been reported. The first case was reported on September 19, 2020, in which four men from Karnataka were arrested. The second case was reported on March 5, 2021, in which seven people from Kerala were arrested and the third case of arrests was reported after Wednesday’s raids. With these arrests, Kerala moved to the second spot in the list with 24 arrests while Karnataka jumped to the fourth with 15 arrests, followed by Telangana (14), as per the NIA information. While answering a question regarding ‘reports of the presence of Islamic terrorists in southern states of India’, during the monsoon session in September 2020, the Union ministry of home affairs told parliament: “Some instances of individuals from different States, including the Southern States, having joined Islamic State (IS) have come to the notice of Central and State Security Agencies.” NIA has registered 17 cases related to the presence of IS sympathizers in Telangana, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. “Investigations by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) have revealed that IS is most active in Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Jammu & Kashmir,” read the MHA statement in Rajya Sabha. B Dayananda, additional director general of police (Intelligence), Karnataka, said the numbers mentioned by the MHA are only pertaining to the cases registered by NIA. “As per the state government’s records, 30 people have been arrested for links with the Islamic State,” he said. The state intelligence chief added that so far the arrests have been made in connection with radicalisation and evidence of contact with members of the Islamic State. “We have come across people who have been following IS propaganda constantly and some of them have made contact with people in IS. Most of the arrests are related to this,” said the officer. The arrest of Mehdi Masroor Biswas, an engineer who ran a pro-Islamic State Twitter handle, in 2014, has been one of the biggest catches for the Bengaluru police. In its charge sheet, the Bengaluru police claimed that Biswas would monitor the developments of ISIS on the internet and TV and assist his followers, who were willing to enter the ISIS territory. He would tweet about vulnerable sections along the border on the basis of which volunteers entered the ISIS territory, the charge sheet added. “For enforcement agencies, radicalization is a big concern. As far as Karnataka is concerned, we have been very clear that online radicalization has to be taken seriously as lone-wolf attacks are being witnessed across the world. Certainly, more attention is needed on this front,” said a former IPS officer, who was intelligence chief during his tenure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-from-bhatkal-held-for-terror-links-wave-of-arrests-sounds-is-alarm-in-south-india-101628679090306.html
11-08-2021||India||Nine days on, army helicopter wreckage located 80m inside Ranjit Sagar dam||The remains of the army aviation helicopter that crashed into Ranjit Sagar dam in Jammu’s Kathua district with two pilots onboard nine days ago were finally located on Wednesday at a depth of nearly 80 meters.“The wreckage of the #ArmyHelicopter that had crashed into the #RanjitSagarReservoir has been identified at a depth of approx 80m from the surface of the reservoir. Heavy duty #RemotelyOperatedVehicles are being flown in to assist the recovery operations,” the Western Command of Indian Army wrote in a post on its Twitter handle.The families of the two pilots, one of them a lieutenant colonel and the second a captain, have been camping at Mamun cantonment at Pathankot, from where the Rudra helicopter took off for a training sortie involving low-level flying over the lake before crashing into it around 10.43 am on August 3. The chopper was from the army’s Pathankot-based 254 ALH-WSI squadron, which earlier lost a Rudra chopper in January 2021. The search and recovery operations had found some broken parts of the chopper and gear of the pilots including the helmets floating into the lake the same day but search for the wreckage and the pilots had not yielded any satisfactory result for the last nine days despite intense operations in 25km long, 8km wide and more than 500 feet deep dam.“The Indian Army is coordinating the efforts of Indian Navy deep divers team consisting of two officers, four JCOs and 24 other ranks, Indian Army Special Forces divers team consisting of two officers, one JCO and 24 other ranks, multi beam sonars, side scanners, remotely operated vehicles and underwater manipulators which have been flown in from Chandigarh, Delhi, Mumbai and Kochi and pressed into action at the crash site of the dam,” Defence spokesperson lieutenant colonel Devender Anand said on Tuesday, adding that search operations continued despite bad weather and rain.Army, navy, air force, national disaster response force (NDRF), state disaster response force (SDRF), NGOs, state police, dam authorities and private firms from all over the country were involved in the recovery operation which was challenging due to the near zero visibility below 50 meters owing to the colloidal nature of water in this season adversely impacting the accuracy of sonars and other sensors, the army spokesperson had said. However, the operation continued with experts, specialised equipment and divers flown in.“No efforts are being spared for early conclusion of the search operation. A small area of 60m by 60m has been localized and special sonar equipment flown in from Kochi is being employed to enable the search operations to enter their final phase,” the defence spokesperson said onTuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-helicopter-wreckage-located-80-m-under-ranjit-sagar-dam-9-days-after-crash-101628678669920.html
11-08-2021||India||Chhattisgarh funding tribal places of worship to prevent conversions: Minister||The Chhattisgarh government has been funding tribal communities to develop and maintain their traditional places of worship, known as Devgudis, so that they aren’t lured by anyone to convert to another religion, said state industry minister Kawasi Lakma on Tuesday.Lakma, a senior Congress leader from Bastar, which has a large tribal population, also claimed that no tribal has converted to Christianity during the past 2.5 years of Congress rule in the state.Lakhma was responding to allegations by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that religious conversions were taking place in Bastar.“During the 15 years of BJP rule, 30 churches were constructed (in Sukma district) but not a single one came up in the last two years. To ensure that conversions do not take place and people do not visit churches, the state government has been providing ₹5 lakh (each) to ‘Devgudis’ and ₹10 lakh to ‘Ghotuls’ in Bastar…We want our temples and Devgudis to be in good shape. In the last two years, no religious conversion has taken place,” Lakhma said during an interaction with the local media.For the last one year, the Bastar district administration has been funding the beautification and maintenance of Devgudis that are temple-like structures housing deities of the tribal community and where their rituals take place. Devgudis play a pivotal role in the lives of the Bastar tribals. The local administration has also been developing Ghotuls, the place where tribal boys and girls celebrate festivals and meet to choose life partners.BJP spokesperson Gauri Shankar Srivas claimed that Lakma’s statement was “contradictory to the realities on the ground”.“A month ago, the Sukma police chief asked officials for strict surveillance over the activities of Christian missionaries and the converted tribals, and now Lakhma is saying that no conversion is taking place. Both the statements are contradictory. The Congress is trying to propagate soft Hindutva to win elections but they have no faith in Hinduism,” said Srivas.Reacting to Lakma’s statement, Chhattisgarh Christian Forum said it was “unfortunate” and “far from the truth”.“The fact is that the Congress government is providing funds for the construction of temples in tribal villages. Newly constructed temples of Lord Ram and Lord Shiva have been appearing in the tribal villages. The saffron fundamentalists are trying to claim that the tribals are Hindus. We perceive that the minister’s statement is part of the strategy to declare tribals as Hindus,” said Arun Pannalal, president of Chhattisgarh Christian Forum.Pannalal added that Christians are falsely accused of forcing people to convert by vested interests who want to take away lands and rights of the tribal community by falsely establishing them as Hindus as against the Supreme Court’s opinion that the tribals were religiously independent hence enjoyed the benefits of government reservations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-funding-tribal-places-of-worship-to-prevent-conversions-minister-101628676030518.html

This comes at a time when neighbouring Kerala is witnessing a sudden surge in the number of Covid infections and the apprehension of a third wave of the pandemic is looming large.Going by the civic body's Covid bulletin, between August 5 and August 10, there have been around 250 children, aged between o to 19 years.Here is a date-wise break-up of children testing positiveAugust 100 to 9 years - 18 cases10 to 19 years - 27 casesAugust 90 to 9 years -- 18 cases10 to 19 years - 24 casesAlso Read: Bengaluru Lockdown: Night curfew, Section 144 till August 16; 141 containment zones in cityAugust 80 to 9 years - 13 cases10 to 19 years -- 25 casesAugust 60 to 9 years - 32 cases10 to 19 years - 34 casesAugust 50 to 9 years - 21 cases10 to 19 years - 38 casesThe figure is in tune with the overall increase in Covid positive cases in Bengaluru, which started in July last week. Around 50 children have been testing Covid positive every day since the last week of July.Children below the age of 18 years are thought to be at greater risk in the possible third wave of the pandemic, though experts have asserted that there is no scientific base behind this assumption. The assumption is based on the concept that children have not been affected much in the first two waves. But serosurvey data shows children have been equally exposed to the infection in the first two waves as they too have developed antibodies against the virus naturally.During the second wave of the pandemic, Karnataka reported a considerable number of children testing Covid positive.Bengaluru Police have imposed Section 144 in the city while several restrictions have been put in place in the entire state. Schools for classes 9 to 12 will reopen from August 23, the state government announced a few days ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/around-250-cases-in-5-days-bengaluru-sees-spike-of-covid-cases-among-youth-children-amid-3rd-wave-fear-101628673970224.html

School openings must be prioritised with distancing, masking, avoiding indoor singing and gatherings, hand hygiene and vaccination of all adults," Swaminathan said onTwitter. She also tagged India's NITI Aayog and UNICEF in the tweet. Dr Yasmin Ali Haque, UNICEF Representative in India was also marked.Earlier on August 6, the senior doctor had cautioned people to not let their guards down against the Covid-19 as social activities started resuming. She also urged people to continue to strictly follow Covid-appropriate behaviour for at least another six months. "I know everybody is tired, everyone wants to meet their family, organise parties. But this is not the time to let down your guard. Let's be careful for another six months. By then, if the vaccination coverage is very high, then things should definitely start improving," the WHO chief scientist had said.Schools across the country started reopening as the overall nationwide infections started receding after the deadly second wave of Covid-19. Since the beginning of the pandemic last year, classes have been erratic due to the brief closures of schools due to the pandemic. Most schools have also moved on to online education because of the pandemic.On June 19, the Union education ministry had released the guidelines for parent participation in home-based learning during school closure and beyond.Former education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank in his tweet said that "in this 'new normal' of the pandemic, considering parents' role as pivotal to children's growth and learning, these Guidelines aim to provide information on the 'why', 'what', and 'how-to' of participation and engagement in supporting children during the school closure, irrespective of their literacy levels. Home is the first school, and parents are the first teachers".The guidelines on home-based learning emphasise on the need for parents to create a safe and engaging environment and a positive learning environment, have realistic expectations from the child, take care of health and eat healthy, while at the same time having fun with children.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prioritise-school-reopening-with-adherence-to-covid-norms-who-scientist-101628671501791.html

The sub-sonic cruise missile was fired at 9:55am and was tested for 100 km in flight and 15 minutes in time.The firing was a partial success. According to DRDO sources, the indigenous engine was successfully tested but the delivery platform came down due to inexplicable reasons. "Maybe a snag in the controller, but the engine worked well. Next test firing will be done in mission mode before user trial for air force and navy," said an official.This was the first successful test-firing with the indigenous booster engine after the previous one had to be aborted after eight minutes flying time.Nirbhay is a subsonic missile, flying at a speed of 0.7 to 0.9 Mach, with sea-skimming and terrain-hugging capability that helps the missile stay under enemy radar to avoid detection. It is a two-stage missile with first stage using solid fuel and the second using liquid fuel. It carries a convention warhead of 300 kilograms weight and can hit targets upto 1500 km range. The missile is capable of flying between 50 metres to four km from ground and pick up the target before engaging and destroying it.The missile also has a loitering capability that allows the delivery platform to manoeuvre mid-flight and at the end to hit the target by doing inflight course corrections. It can be fired from sea, land and through mobile launchers.The missile is now going to be handed over to the army, which will conduct three more tests before inducting it. After induction, Nirbhay is expected to be deployed along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) amid the stand-off with China at multiple points in East Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nirbhay-cruise-missile-test-fired-drdo-says-indigenous-engine-a-success-101628656458294.html

11-08-2021||India||Rashtra Manch calls for full restoration of J&K’s statehood, free and fair elections||Former union minister Yashwant Sinha-led Rashtra Manch on Wednesday demanded the full restoration of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K)’s statehood before free and fair elections there while slamming the manner in which the government revoked the region’s semi-autonomous status in 2019.“Two years have passed since the Union Government annulled Article 370… and Article 35A, which protected the rights and privileges of its permanent residents… Simultaneously, the State itself was bifurcated into two parts… These actions and the utterly undemocratic manner in which they were taken have caused a deep sense of hurt, humiliation, and betrayal in the minds of the people of Jammu and Kashmir,” the group said in a statement. It added the government took these decisions unilaterally without consulting local people, the “principal stakeholders in a democracy”, and their elected representatives. The group lashed out at the government for detaining leaders in Kashmir who “repeatedly pledged their allegiance to India.”Also Read | Punjab CM likely to meet PM Modi today; discuss security threat, farm lawsHundreds of people, including three former chief ministers, were detained in 2019 to prevent protests against the revocation of the semi-autonomous status through nullification of the Constitution’s Articles 370 and 35A. A lockdown and communications blackout were also imposed in 2019 in J&K.Calling this situation “unacceptable in a free and democratic India,” the group said that even today people are not able to express their views freely. “(Prime Minister Narendra) Modi government’s actions have caused losses worth tens of thousands of crores to the economy of Jammu and Kashmir. Lakhs of youth have lost employment and there has been a worrisome increase in suicides among young people,” the group said. It added all explanations of the government to justify its actions have been “hollow.”The group asked Modi to announce full statehood for J&K before the end of 2021 in his Independence Day speech. It added the delimitation exercise in J&K should be deferred and held along with other states in India.The government has said it is committed to restoring the statehood and that elections in the region will be held after the exercise to draw new constituencies is over.The group also requested the apex court to hear petitions against the nullification of Article 370 and soon announce a decision keeping in view all the concerned people. It added since J&K is a border region, it is directly affected by the worsening of India’s relations with Pakistan and China.“The ongoing developments in Afghanistan (where Taliban is seeking to return to power in Kabul by force) are also a matter of grave concern since these could have a negative effect on peace in Jammu and Kashmir. Therefore, the Government of India must act with extreme care and alacrity to prevent anti-India forces from exploiting the situation of ‘Dil ki Doori’ and ‘Dilli ki Doori’,” it said.In his first such meeting with leaders from J&K following the nullification of Article 370, Modi on June 24 said that he wants to remove both Dil ki Doori (the distance between hearts) and Dilli ki Doori (the distance from Delhi and J&K).The group also called “separatism and communal politics” common enemies which should be fought together.There was no immediate response from the government or the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rashtra-manch-calls-for-full-restoration-of-j-k-s-statehood-free-and-fair-elections-101628666549329.html

The chief minister is likely to take up with the PM the growing threat to the state’s security from across the border following the recent influx of weapons, hand-grenades and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Past Sunday, Punjab Police busted a terror plot with the recovery of a tiffin box fabricated into an IED. They also recovered five hand grenades and 100 rounds of a 9mm pistol from Daleke village in Lopoke sub division of Amritsar district. Director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta said the operation was conducted following inputs of drone activity in border villages of Daleke, Bhikhiwind and Shohra.Also Read | Punjab on alert as drone-dropped tiffin bomb, grenades found in AmritsarBesides pressing for repeal of the three controversial farm laws against which farmers have been protesting for months now, and seeking an increase in the supply of Covid vaccine doses, the CM is also expected to make a request for enhanced allocation of fertiliser diammonium phosphate to Punjab to address the farmers’ apprehensions regarding fertiliser shortage in the state, said the person quoted above.Singh met Union home minister Amit Shah in the national capital on Tuesday and requested him to urgently provide 25 companies of central armed police forces and anti-drone gadgets for the Border Security Force for protection against Pakistan-backed terror outfits.“The security situation is grave and needs the Centre’s immediate intervention with Pakistan’s ISI also raising the ante ahead of the Independence Day and in the run-up to the Punjab assembly polls,” he told Shah, citing social, economic and security implications of the prolonged farmers’ agitation. He also expressed concern over the fear of “inimical powers” from across the border trying to exploit the resentment and disgruntlement against the government. The assembly polls in Punjab are due early next year. Singh is also scheduled to meet Union chemicals and fertilisers minister Mansukh Mandaviya to discuss fertiliser shortage in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-amarinder-to-meet-pm-modi-today-discuss-security-threat-farm-laws-101628662769010.html
11-08-2021||India||‘Views of Haryana, Punjab, Bihar, Bengal CMs taken before passage of farm laws’||The Centre onTuesday told Parliament that recommendations from chief ministers of Haryana, Punjab, Bihar, and West Bengal were taken into account before the three farm laws that have triggered protracted protests were passed last year. It added ministers of 10 states were part of a committee formed in 2010 and they recommended that the “monopoly” of Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees or corporate licensees should not be allowed.The Centre said this in response to Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) lawmaker Harsimrat Kaur Badal’s question to union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar whether Punjab objected to the framing of the laws when consultations were held between 2017 to 2020 and whether it submitted consent for the legislation.Tomar said the government felt the need to reform the agricultural marketing sector to ensure “better and competitive price” realisation to the farmers and encourage capital formation in the sector. He added the government constituted various committees including an Empowered Committee of 10 state ministers in charge of agriculture marketing in 2010 and a Working Group of Agriculture Production in May 2010 for recommending market reform measures. Tomar said the group said the market for agricultural produce “must be immediately freed of all sorts of restrictions on movement, trading, stocking, finance, exports, etc.”Also Read | MP clears Bill to curb illicit liquor trade, provides for capital punishment“The said Committee recommended that no monopoly, including that of Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) or corporate licensees should be allowed to restrict the market,” Tomar said. He added state governments were also consulted through video conferencing in May 2020 for feedback on the new legal framework facilitating barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade in agriculture produce. Tomar said officials representing states and union territories including Punjab attended it.The Left Front ruled West Bengal in 2010 before it lost power to Trinamool Congress (TMC) a year later. The Left parties as well as TMC have opposed the three farm laws. Congress, which has also opposed the legislation, ruled Haryana until 2014. SAD ruled poll-bound Punjab from 2007 to 2017 and quit the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government at the Centre over the farm laws.Growers protesting against the farm laws renewed the push for their repeal last month as they began a sit-in near Parliament. They say the laws threaten their livelihoods and thousands of them have camped on highways near Delhi for months in protest against the legislation. Opposition lawmakers have protested against the farm laws during the ongoing Monsoon Session of Parliament.The government has maintained the laws, which were passed in September 2020, will boost the income of farmers even as growers insist the legislation favours private retailers by allowing them to buy farm goods outside government-regulated wholesale markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/views-of-haryana-punjab-bihar-bengal-cms-were-taken-before-passage-of-farm-laws-govt-101628661928972.html
11-08-2021||India||Venkaiah Naidu says opposition leaders who created ruckus in Rajya Sabha will face action||Vice President and Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday said that action will be taken against members of opposition parties who created ruckus during a short-duration discussion on farm issues yesterday.This comes after Union home minister Amit Shah, leader of the house Piyush Goyal and other Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MPs met Naidu, news agency ANI reported.As the proceedings of the upper house began this morning, an emotional Naidu said, "All sacredness of this House was destroyed yesterday when some members sat on the tables and some climbed on the tables."There are no words to convey my anguish and to condemn such acts, Naidu added. "I spent a sleepless night as I struggled to find out the provocation of reason forcing this august House to such a low yesterday," said Naidu.His remarks were in reference to the debate held on Tuesday. While the discussion was underway, some members of the opposition parties, including Congress, Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), trooped into the well with sloganeering. Congress leader Pratap Singh Bajwa climbed atop a table and was seen throwing an official file at the Chair.Bajwa later said he has no regrets. "I will do this 100 times again if the government does not give us an opportunity to discuss the three black anti-agriculture laws," he told news agency PTI.Union minister Anurag Thakur slammed the Congress party for lowering the dignity of the House with their unruly conduct. "A party which has not been able to choose a new president, whose MPs tear the legislations of their own party and doesn't allow Parliament to function by indulging in condemnable behaviour shows that the democracy was shamed. People have elected these MPs to discuss issues in Parliament, but they have stooped to tearing papers and throwing files," said Thakur.He added that crores of rupees are spent on holding a session of Parliament. "Whatever happened yesterday shamed the democracy," said the minister.Several members of the opposition parties stood on the table where the parliamentary staff sits right below the Chair. A few of them squatted on the tables for over one-and-half hours during which proceedings were adjourned multiple times.Rajya Sabha television did not show the scenes of ruckus, but opposition MPs recorded the events and posted them on their Twitter handles.The Lok Sabha, meanwhile, was adjourned sine die, days before the monsoon session was scheduled to end on August 13. The Rajya Sabha too will be adjourned sine die later today after the passage of 127th constitution amendment bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naidu-says-opposition-leaders-who-created-ruckus-in-rajya-sabha-will-face-action-101628661576372.html
11-08-2021||India||Govt to soon provide certificates to people who got Covid jabs outside India: Report||People who received the jab against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outside the country will soon be able to download their vaccination certificate through the CoWin, a portal introduced by the Indian government to streamline the inoculation drive process, Livemint reported on Tuesday, quoting a government official.According to the report, the certificate will be given to both categories of people - those who have received one jab or fully vaccinated. It will also be opened for foreign vaccines that have not yet been approved by the country's drug regulatory authority, Livemint said.Currently, people entering India who were administered with the jab outside the country are unable to get a vaccination certificate in India."There are Indians or foreigners who have received one or two doses of vaccines such as Pfizer or Sinopharm in other countries and are planning to come and stay in India... In a bid to smoothen the process for such people, we are working out a provision," Livemint reported Dr NK Arora as saying. Arora is chairman of India’s Covid-19 working group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI).Arora also clarified that until the provision comes into effect, those who are already vaccinated are not required to take the vaccine again in the country in order to obtain the certificate. "We will ensure that such people can get vaccination certificates through Co-WIN platform. We will soon enable this feature in our nationwide covid-19 vaccination programme," the official also said as per the MINT report.The move holds significance as it is mandatory for various purposes, including crossing borders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-soon-provide-certificates-to-people-who-got-covid-jabs-outside-india-report-101628660070062.html

With the mission, the agency will resume the country’s space activities after a gap of over four months due to the second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.On Wednesday, the agency tweeted that countdown for the launch commenced at 0343 hours.Countdown for the launch of GSLV-F10/EOS-03 mission commenced today at 0343Hrs (IST) from Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) SHAR, Sriharikota#GSLVF10 #EOS03 #ISRO pic.twitter.com/ICzSfTHMBIThis will be the second operational flight of GSLV Mk III after the Chandrayaan-2 mission when the launch vehicle “over-performed” placing the spacecraft in a higher orbit and saving fuel for upcoming manoeuvres.This will be the first time that the vehicle’s payload fairing, the nose of the rocket where the satellites are carried, will be a 4m ogive (bullet-like shape). The changes will make the vehicle more aerodynamic and the same payload fairing is likely to be used for the country’s human spaceflight.Also Read | Four ISRO launches over next 5 months; Gaganyaan delayed, Centre tells LSThe EOS-3 satellite, also known as GISAT-1 as per previous nomenclature, is one of the two paired satellites, the other being GISAT-2 or EOS-5, that will be able to provide images of the Indian landmass every 30 minutes with a spatial resolution of 50 metres.The space agency is targeting four launches over the next five months – all earth observation satellites. One of the four will be carried by the small satellite launch vehicle in its maiden flight. All big-ticket missions, such as the first uncrewed flight under Gaganyaan mission, Chandrayaan-3 mission, and India’s first solar mission Aditya L1 have all been delayed due to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-to-launch-earth-observation-satellite-aboard-gslv-mk-iii-vehicle-tomorrow-101628657308904.html
11-08-2021||India||Isro to launch GISAT-1 in less than 24 hours, a game-changer for India: 10 points||Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) said on Wednesday morning that countdown has already begun for the launch of India's "eye in the sky" - the GISAT-1 Earth observation satellite (EOS). The satellite is slated to be launched at 5:43am on Thursday on a geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle (GSLV) from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) at Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh as a part of the GSLV-F10 EOS-03 mission. India awaits the much-touted event, which has been set up days before people celebrate the country's achievements on Independence Day.Also Read | Isro to launch earth observation satellite aboard GSLV Mk III vehicle tomorrowThere are reasons why the GISAT-1 satellite launch is being termed a game-changer as far as India's space ambitions are concerned, owing to its functionality in Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit, before moving on to the final geostationary orbit. Here's a brief explainer on the scope of this satellite launch.1. Officially termed the Geo Imaging Satellite-1 (GISAT-1), the satellite launched by Isro will keep an eye out on "locations of interest" for India. Essentially, it will serve as India's "eye in the sky".2. While replying to a question in Parliament earlier this week, Union minister of state (MoS) in charge of the department of space, Jitendra Singh, said that the Earth observation satellite will send Isro 4-5 photographs from across the country daily.3. On the basis of these photographs, India will be able to monitor and respond to natural disasters and any other short-term events at an alarming pace, according to officials of the space agency familiar with the matter.4. Moreover, the GISAT-1 satellite will also obtain spectral signatures for agriculture, forestry, mineralogy, cloud properties, snow and glaciers, and oceanography, enabling researchers back home to gain new insight on a host of issues.5. Isro said that the Earth observation satellite will initially be placed by the launch vehicle in the Geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO), a highly elliptic geocentric orbit that almost always serves as an intermediate step for satellites before reaching for their final orbit. The GTO Earth orbit has an apogee of 42,164 km (26,199 miles) above sea level, which corresponds to the geostationary altitude.6. EOS-03 will appear motionless in space once it is in orbit since it will travel at the rate of rotation of the planet. This is important since, unlike low-Earth satellites, the geostationary satellite will not have to constantly readjust its position, paving the way for round-the-clock, real-time monitoring of key areas of interest to India.7. Isro's GSLV-F10 rocket will install the 2,268-kg state-of-the-art agile satellite GISAT-1 in the geosynchronous orbit. This spacecraft, codenamed EOS-3, will be flown on the fourteenth flight of the GSLV.8. Isro has made some changes to the fairing capsule used in its satellite. In a first, the space agency said that it is sending an Ogive-shaped payload measuring a diameter of 4 metres this time.9. The GISAT-1 launch was originally slated for March 5 last year but it was delayed in view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and subsequent technical glitches. It was later rescheduled twice, once for March 28 and then again postponed to May in view of the second wave of the pandemic, before settling for a final date on August 11.10. In its latest update, the space agency informed that the filling of oxidiser for the second stage (GS2) of GSLV-F10 has been completed, while the filling of propellant for the second stage has commenced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-to-launch-gisat-1-geo-imaging-satellite-in-less-than-24-hours-game-changer-for-india-10-points-101628653819321.html
11-08-2021||India||MP clears Bill to curb illicit liquor trade, provides for capital punishment||The Madhya Pradesh assembly on Tuesday passed the Madhya Pradesh Excise (Amendment) Bill that provides for the death penalty and fine up to ₹20 lakh for anyone convicted for the second time of making and supplying spurious liquor that causes death.Finance and excise minister Jagdish Deora, who tabled the bill, said the proposed law that has been sent to governor Mangubhai Patel for approval will curb the sale and manufacturing of illicit liquor in the state. “With the amendment in the Act, we are taking tough action. Recently, we raised a dhaba of illicit liquor supplier in Mandsaur,” he said.The excise law in the state earlier provided for imprisonment of two months to 10 years for those convicted of involvement in illicit liquor trade for the first time and life imprisonment for the second.Officials cited the deaths of about 50 people after consuming illicit liquor over the last 11 months and said this prompted the government to seek an amendment to the law.Also Read | MP assembly passes supplementary budget amid protests by Opposition“If consumption of illicit liquor causes the death of a human being, there is a provision of imprisonment which shall not be less than two years but may extend to life imprisonment and shall also be liable to a fine of ₹five lakh. When the person is convicted under this section for a second or subsequent offence there is a provision of imprisonment for capital punishment and shall also be liable to fine up to ₹20 lakh,” says the Bill.“In case of liquor is found unfit for human consumption, there is a provision of imprisonment which shall not be less than six months, but may extend to six years and shall also, be liable to fine up to ₹1 lakh. In a case of consumption of illicit liquor caused injury to human beings, there is a provision of imprisonment which shall not be less than two years but may extend to eight years and shall also be liable to a fine up to ₹2 lakh.”The Opposition welcomed the passage of the Bill. “Everybody knows the mafia became so active during the tenure of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led state government. During the 15-month tenure of (former chief minister), Kamal Nath, all land, sand, and illegal liquor mafias and anti-social elements went underground as tough action was being taken against them. But they again resumed their work when BJP came to power (in March 2020). Now, they are trying to rectify their mistake by increasing punishment,” said Congress leader Sajjan Verma.BJP leader Hitesh Bajpai said this is for the “first time any government has come up with tough laws against adulteration”. “Earlier, the government introduced capital punishment for adulteration in food products and now in liquor. Congress leaders believe in blaming... but the BJP government believes in working to bring change in the lives of people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-assembly-passes-bill-to-curb-illicit-liquor-trade-provides-for-capital-punishment-101628656769066.html

The surgery was carried out at Narayana Hospital in Jaipur, Hindustan Times' sister publication Live Hindustan reported on Tuesday. The patient - a retired constable - kept chanting the Gayatri Mantra during the surgery, according to Live Hindustan.The constable, identified as Ridhamlal Ram, had epilepsy which caused severe seizures and also affected his speech, Live Hindustan reported. The doctors diagnosed a low-grade tumour in the area of brain responsible for speech.Even a slight error during the surgical procedure could have resulted in loss of speech or even paralysis due to the location of the tumour. But a team under Doctor KK Bansal performed the complex surgery, which lasted for four hours, and saved the life of the 57-year-old.Live Hindustan quoted zonal clinical director Dr Mala Aron to report that the team used a high-end operating microscope to focus on the precise location of the tumour and eliminate the chances of error. The doctor said that such surgery is conducted at very few places in the country.The doctors kept Ram awake during the surgical procedure and he chanted the Gayatri Mantra. The doctors said that they usually give anesthesia to patients during a surgery, but Ram was operated upon in full consciousness to understand the impact of the procedure on various parts of the brain and remove any chances of error.A similar incident was reported in 2018 when a 30-year-old accountant kept chanting the Hanuman Chalisa during a brain surgery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaipur-57-year-old-recites-gayatri-mantra-as-doctor-removes-brain-tumour-101628655982711.html

The ATM was installed at Dr H Gordon Roberts Hospital, which will turn 100 next year, he said. "The teller machine was installed on August 7 after a petition was submitted to State Bank of India for setting up an ATM on the premises before the centennial celebrations of our facility next year," Medical Superintendent of the hospital Dr Roken Nongrum told PTI. The access to an ATM in the facility will help patient parties and staffers immensely, he said. “We are grateful to the bank authorities for considering our request. The ATM is special as the inventor of automated teller machine was born in this hospital 96 years ago," Nongrum said. Shepherd-Barron came up with the concept of a self-service cash dispenser in 1965 and his "eureka" moment was inspired by a machine dispensing chocolate bars. The first ATM was installed at a bank in London in 1967. Reg Varney, one of the stars of a popular TV show became the first person to withdraw cash.

11-08-2021||India||Himachal Pradesh schools closed, curbs increased to check Covid-19 spread||The Himachal Pradesh government announced the closure of schools across the state till August 22. The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday which was chaired by chief minister Jairam Thakur.The state government earlier had opened schools for Classes 10 and 12, but now they have been closed till August 22. However, teaching and non-teaching staff will continue to attend the school, according to government order.The education department has been asked to frame standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the residential schools to contain Covid-19, the order further said.The Himachal Pradesh government is concerned about the spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the state. The state recorded 419 fresh Covid-19 cases and two deaths on Tuesday, which took the total number of infections and fatalities to 2,08,616 and 3,521 respectively.Few days ago, the number of active cases had dipped to around 800 but the sudden surge took the figure to 2,318 on Tuesday. The state had recorded 2,086 active cases on Monday while the positivity rate stood at 1.9%, according to health department figures.There are six districts in Himachal Pradesh which have recorded a rising trend in daily new Covid-19 cases over the last fortnight, according to Union health ministry. The reproduction factor (R-factor) - or the ability of the virus to reproduce - has also stayed above 1 (currently at 1.3), the ministry said. The R-factor has to stay below 1 for an outbreak to be called under control.The state government is also concerned about the tourist inflow, and has decided to make it mandatory for tourists to carry RT-PCR negative reports of a minimum of 72 hours, Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) report of 24 hours or vaccination certificate with both doses to enter the state.The state government had earlier issued an advisory to the tourists entering the state to follow the above guidelines which have been made mandatory now.The inter-state, inter-district and intra-district movement of public transport buses has been allowed, but with 50 per cent of the registered seating capacity, according to state government order. However, only those passengers who have the above-mentioned test reports and certificates will be allowed to travel on these buses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/himachal-pradesh-schools-closed-curbs-increased-to-check-covid-19-spread-101628651244567.html
11-08-2021||India||Music helped people cope with Covid-19 stress: Study||Many people used music to relieve feelings of depression, anxiety and stress during the lockdown, a recent study revealed. The study found that people who had an increase in positive emotions were either listening to or making music to cope with their feelings during the Covid-19 pandemic.The study was carried out based on responses of 5,000 people from India, Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy, and the US through an online survey during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic between mid-April and mid-May 2020. More than half the respondents reported using music to cope with emotional and social stressors.“It’s worth noting that music itself wasn’t the coping aid, but rather, music-related behaviour, specifically the ways people have adapted their musical behaviours during the crisis,” Melanie Wald-Fuhrmann, director of the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics that conducted the study, said in a media statement. “In this regard, music listening and music-making appear to provide different coping potentials,” she added.Also Watch | Delhi: How widespread is Delta variant in 2nd wave? Health minister reveals During the lockdown, people used music mainly to positively influence their individual emotional valence and arousal levels, the study stated. “The top ten functions that increased most in importance for listening and making music all point towards mitigating negative states and emotions and boosting positive ones, most importantly via enjoyment in music itself.”Mumbai based psychiatrist Dr Sagar Mundada (not involved with the study) agreed that music can play a key role in coping with stress and anxiety. “I have often recommended calming music with instruments such as flute or violin to my patients with anxiety and sleep disorders,” said Mundada. “In simple terms, the brains of these patients are continuously emitting high-frequency waves. Music helps calm them down and reduce this frequency. It acts as a supplement to the medication in mild cases,” he said.The pandemic and the ensuing lockdown has resulted in a spurt in cases of phobia, anxiety and sleep disorders. “When recommending music as a supplement, one must ensure that the patient is fond of music. I don’t recommend it to patients who have no interest in music,” said Mundada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/music-helped-people-cope-with-covid-19-stress-study-101628651308088.html

11-08-2021||India||DCGI accepts proposal to study mixing of Covid-19 vaccine doses||The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has accepted a proposal that a research be conducted to analyse mixing a dose each of the two vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), Covaxin and Covishield. "Permission has been granted for research study at CMC Vellore on mixing of vaccine doses," news agency ANI quoted Dr VK Paul, Niti Aayog, as saying.Permission has been granted for a research study by CMC Vellore (Tamil Nadu) on mixing of vaccines doses: Dr V K Paul, Niti Aayog during a press briefing on Tuesday pic.twitter.com/QogE9UwBWzThe Subjects Experts Committee (SEC) of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) had, on July 29, recommended that a study be conducted in this regard at Christian Medical College (CMC) in Vellore in the southern state. The proposed trial will see 300 volunteers being administered a dose each of Covaxin and Covishield.Also Read | Expert panel recommends trials on mixing Covid-19 vaccines - Covaxin, CovishieldThe study will aim to determine whether two different vaccine doses could be administered for a person to be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus disease, instead of the existing practice of administering twin shots of the same vaccine.The exercise, however, is different from a recent research conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) which concluded that combining two different shots is “safe and effective.” The ICMR research had analysed an “accidental” mixing of Covishield and Covaxin in a village in Uttar Pradesh, in May. The incident saw recipients being administered Covaxin as second dose, six weeks after they received Covishield as first. On analysing this, the ICMR found that “combining two different Covid-19 vaccines gives better immune response than two doses of the same vaccine.”Also Read | Mixing shots safe and effective: StudyExperts, including top virologist Dr Gagandeep Kang, see combining two different vaccines as a way to tackle vaccine shortage, though they also warn that more studies are needed to reach a definitive conclusion to determine the efficacy of this method in preventing Covid-19.

Covaxin, developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech International Limited, is India’s first and thus far only indigenous anti-Covid shot. The Oxford University-AstraZeneca shot, on the other hand, is being manufactured locally as Covishield by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII). Besides these, three other vaccines, too, have been approved by the DCGI to be used in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dcgi-accepts-proposal-to-study-mixing-of-covid-19-vaccine-doses-report-101628648282031.html

The geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle (GSLV) is scheduled to launch the Earth observation satellite (EOS) - GISAT-1 at 5:43am tomorrow (i.e. on Thursday, August 12) from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) at Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh.

11-08-2021||India||Twitter has complied with IT rules, says Centre||The Union government on Tuesday informed the Delhi high court that micro-blogging website Twitter is prima facie in compliance with the new Information Technology Rules, 2021 for appointing three-tier grievance redressal officers.Additional solicitor general (ASG) Chetan Sharma, representing the Centre, told Justice Rekha Palli that resident grievance officer (RGO), chief compliance officer (CCO) and nodal contact officer (NCO) have been appointed in compliance with the law.He, however, said, “It would be better if our affidavit comes on record. The chief compliance officer, the nodal contact person and the resident grievance officer have been appointed and they (Twitter) are today in compliance with the law. That’s the email that I’ve received (from the instructing authority). It’s better to have an affidavit”.The submissions came while hearing a plea filed by lawyer Amit Acharya who had contended that IT Rules came into effect from February 25 and the Centre had given three months to every social media intermediary, including Twitter, to comply with them.However, the plea added that even after the lapse of the three-month period on May 25, till date no resident grievance officer has been appointed by Twitter to deal with complaints regarding tweets on its platform, due which, he could not take action against two alleged offensive tweets by Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Mohua Moitra and journalist Swati Chaturvedi.Twitter later disposed of his plea saying the tweets in question were not offensive according to its policies.On August 6, Twitter told the court it appointed Vinay Prakash, an Indian resident, as the RGO and CCO on August 4. It added that Shahin Komath has been employed as the NCO.However, the Centre said the position was “yet to be verified” and had sought time to recheck the same.Under Rule 3 of the new Rules, a social media intermediary must place a three-tier grievance redressal system and appoint a chief compliance officer, nodal contact person and resident grievance officer by May 25.On Tuesday, senior advocate Sajjan Poovayya told the court that their affidavit was “on record”.Following the submissions, the court granted time to the Centre to file an affidavit stating that Twitter has complied with the IT Rules.Poovayya said the appointed persons will work on a full-time basis and are fully capable of performing the functions in terms of the law.“Court gave us a long rope. Finally we have rectified the situation. We have permanent people occupying the position,” Poovayya submitted.On July 28, the court slammed Twitter for appointing CCO and RGO as a “contingent worker” while giving it last opportunity to comply with the new IT Rules “wholeheartedly”.Justice Palli had said it was “unacceptable” that the social media intermediary has not specified the third-party contractor via whom the services of the CCO and the RGO have been taken. The court had also expressed displeasure on the delay of appointment of nodal contact officer while taking strong exception to a contingent worker being hired as the RGO and CCO by Twitter.Twitter, in an affidavit filed on July 13, told the court it has appointed an Indian resident as the CCO and RGO whose services have been taken via a third-party contractor. However, they would perform they functions and duties as per applicable law, it said, adding that it would require two weeks to appoint a nodal contact officer through a third party.Twitter then asked for eight weeks to appoint the CCO, RGO and NCO as a direct employee and on a permanent basis.Centre and Twitter have been locking horns over the compliance of the IT Rules. Twitter had said it was committed to India as a vital market, but criticised the new IT rules and regulations, which it added, “Inhibit free, open public conversation”.Responding to the comments, the Centre said the messaging platform was levelling baseless and false allegations to defame India and dictating terms to the world’s largest democracy. The Centre added that only WhatsApp and Facebook have complied with the guidelines of appointing three separate officers for the grievance redressal.On July 22, the Union government informed the Rajya Sabha that even though Twitter was non-compliant of the IT Rules till May 26, it has subsequently appointed an RGO and CCO and submitted its first compliance report in June this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-has-complied-with-it-rules-says-centre-101628644099708.html
11-08-2021||India||Peace has returned to Assam, Mizoram: Himanta Biswa Sarma||Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma speaks to Hindustan Times about the border dispute with Mizoram and the efforts that were made to ease tensions.Is the peace arrangement you have with Mizoram lasting?My ministers visited Aizawl and after that meeting, we issued a joint press release whose operative part was that no state will deploy their police forces at the border and they will try to resolve all the disputes peacefully. Second, both states have decided that CRPF will be at the border till we come to certain solutions. With these two statements, I think peace has returned and vehicular movement has resumed. You cannot keep on fighting with your sister state and I hope peace will be lasting.You met the home minister and the Prime Minister. What did they say about handling the situation?A) First of all, the home minister was involved from day one. When clashes broke out, it was he who advised me to hand over that police post to CRPF. On that day, he called both of us 4-5 times, so we handed over the disputed post’s force in our possession to CRPF. Initially, the post was with the Mizoram police, then the post was reclaimed by us because we consider it our territory. Then, on the home minister’s advice, we handed the post back to the CM and then Mizo police also entered in that police post. The home minister said “chhor do” (leave it) because, after all, CRPF is there. He started playing that critical role from day one. Finally, he was talking to both of us through those 6-7 days and daily 2-3 times, advising and counselling us, understanding our points of view and finally, it was he who drafted the joint press release. So, it was home minister Amit Shah who hand-held the entire event.As far as the PM is concerned, I talked to him over the phone. He said “the country is pained when I see people of two states fighting, especially in the North-East”. The PM has taken so many initiatives to keep N-E away from the underdeveloped tag. So, it was out of respect to him that both state governments have decided to respect his sentiment and signed the peace statement.Could you explain the issue to us?The issue is very, very complex. For Assam, the 1932 boundary, which was ratified by an Act of Parliament, has become the constitutional boundary. Mizoram nurtured a sense of historical injustice. When the state was carved out in 1985, these were dense forests and people of both states weren’t going to these border areas. At that point in time, you could have defined which parts were south, north, etc. You didn’t do that and referred to a geographical territory which is vague, and same with Nagaland and Meghalaya. These are injustices done to the region as a whole. But there are sensitivities and if you transfer that territory, where will the people go? If you transfer them to Nagaland or Arunachal, they are tribal states where non-tribal cannot have land. So, for our people, this is a battle for everything. These are very intense conflicts and even when Kiren Rijiju was home minister (MoS) in 2014, he visited the Assam-Nagaland border where 13 people died. So, it keeps happening every 4-5 years. On 26th July, I had to settle with three states; there was conflict with Mizoram, there was a problem at the Meghalaya border, there was a problem at Arunachal Pradesh and, at the same time, also with Nagaland. In all four states, at the same time, police were eyeball-to-eyeball.You say it is a legacy problem, but you have now been in government for two tenures in Assam. You can’t blame everything on the last 70 years?You cannot solve it. Habitation has come and Mizoram and Nagaland have protection against Article 370. So there are various issues involved there and if you try to solve it, there will be eruption. Today, we are trying to solve the problem in Meghalaya, and every day, there are disturbances. There was a chance when you carved out the state, but you missed that bus. In India, so far, no interstate dispute has been resolved except a small portion of land in Belgaum. It's not easy. It may be easy to advise but not easy to execute.The way you describe it, it sounds almost as fractious as the situation in the Valley.Ours is not comparable as people are not against India. It is a conflict between two states, both loyal to India and both look at Centre for mediation. The Supreme Court has tried to resolve it, but it could not be done. Home minister Amit Shah in Shillong advised us, that when India enters into the 75th year of Independence, you need to resolve at least some dispute to show work between some states through formal or informal negotiation. Something had taken proper shape but while the process was on, the unfortunate clash happened. Between July 26 and 28, I handled with colleagues like Conrad to not make it an issue right now.So, with three states, you managed to handle the situation but one remained (Mizoram)?Even that one has gradually come down.You spoke to Arunachal CM Pema Khandu, Meghalaya CM Conrad Sangma, but not to Mizoram CM Zoramthanga?On July 26, I called him 8 times. He kept saying we will call back. I also kept reverting so if you look at my call logs of that day, you will see our interactions. When firing was going on, we were both just talking on the phone. I told him “look, my men have died”. Zoramthanga said “so sorry, how could it happen?” So when these things were going on from 11am to 5pm, we called each other 8 or more times.So the impression of you interacting only on social media is wrong? No, we were on the phone – the home Minister, Zoramthanga and I. We were all on the line at different times. The home minister called me to say: “Himanta, dekho, aage mat jaane do (Don't let them advance)”. Then I told Zoramthanga: “Firing ho gayi hai, abhi rukwana zaroori hai (firing has happened, we should stop them now)”. I called my DGP: “Bhai rukwao (make them stop)”. Between us, there was communication even when firing was on. We were talking and not through Twitter. Even after that, every day we talk.How does the police force of a particular state turn against another with machine guns?When there was conflict in 1989 between Assam and Nagaland, we lost many lives but we never saw those dead bodies. So these are very, very intense disputes. Today, we are fortunate we could resolve it in six days.How did they have machine guns though?It is called LMG (light machine guns) and they have it on both sides at the border in the North-East and between borders of two states.One of the new ministers who is from the BJP announced in Meghalaya that if they were voted to power there, they would bring in inner line permit in the state (ILP). Is that the party line?There are demands in Meghalaya, and the BJP has also made that demand. When the home minister visited Shillong, a memorandum was submitted and so the Centre and state will discuss. There are demands in Assam, too, but there is also opposition there. We feel that if we have ILP there, then our process of industrialisation will be stalled and tourism will be affected.As CM, you have taken quite a strident position vis-à-vis Hindutva. Do you think that Mizoram backlash is linked to that?I don't think that any policy I take for Assam will have any impact in other states. We banned transportation of cattle but we inserted a provision that other states can take cattle with a transit pass. Whatever we do in Assam, we take care of the sensitivity of other states. If there is any misgiving, I think it is unfounded.Finally, I know that you also had a meeting with national security adviser Ajit Doval. Can you tell us what that was about?In Assam, lower and middle regions are free of militants. If we resolve the ULFA issue, then Assam will see final lasting peace. I have appealed to them to extend their unilateral ceasefire by another three months. Meanwhile, I am speaking to the Centre about what we can offer. Paresh Barua has been in that organisation since 1982 and is now 65 years old. He fought for a cause his whole life and so bringing him back is not very simple. I believe that somehow, if I could ensure some agreement, some peace between Centre and ULFA, then Assam will go to a different level. My friends are talking to Barua and I am attempting for this. Whether it will become a reality, I don’t know. His stated line is that he won’t discuss anything but sovereignty, and I have told him that we can discuss everything except that. Having said that, both sides should agree for some discussion and a common ground is Assam. This won't happen immediately but people are talking to him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/peace-has-returned-to-assam-mizoram-himanta-biswa-sarma-101628642801858.html

Rawat added that there was no discussion on cabinet reshuffle.Rawat said Gandhi advised the state government and the party organisation to work together. “The Congress president also asked me to ensure that both (Singh and Sidhu) work within their respective limits, but cooperate with each other,” he told journalists on continued factionalism in the state unit. “Met @INCIndia president #SoniaGandhi ji in Delhi this evening to discuss various state related issues. Spent an extremely satisfying one hour with her,” the chief minister said in a Twitter post.Singh calls on Shah, seeks repeal of 3 farm lawsThe Punjab CM also called on Union home minister Amit Shah and urged him to repeal the three farm laws, citing social, economic and security implications of a prolonged farmers’ agitation. “While these protests have so far been largely peaceful, one can sense rising tempers, especially as the state moves towards elections in early 2022,” the chief minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-meets-sonia-gandhi-in-delhi-101628640913336.html
11-08-2021||India||HC nod a must to drop cases on politicians: Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Tuesday issued directions that no criminal case against MPs or MLAs can be withdrawn without an approval of the high court of the concerned state, in a move that significantly clips the powers of the state governments at a time when the top court has expressed grave concern over the criminalisation of politics.A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, said that the direction has to be issued urgently in view of a report by the amicus curiae (lawyer to assist the court) depicting several instances where state governments sought to drop charges against sitting and former legislators.“We deem it appropriate to direct that no prosecution against a sitting or former MPs or MLAs shall be withdrawn without the leave of the high court,” ordered the bench, which also included justices Vineet Saran and Surya Kant, in a virtual clampdown on misuse of power by the state governments under Section 321 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) that authorises a prosecutor to seek withdrawal of a criminal case against the accused.On the same day, another bench, comprising justices Rohinton F Nariman and BR Gavai, warned that the nation is “losing its patience” in waiting for lawmakers to cleanse politics by making stronger laws to keep out those with criminal antecedents.Imposing monetary penalty on all major political parties for flouting its directives on disclosure of information about criminal background of their candidates during the 2020 Bihar assembly polls, this bench, in a separate judgment, exhorted lawmakers to “wake up from their deep slumber” to weed out the malignancy of criminalisation in politics.Meanwhile, the CJI-led bench cited its earlier order on September 16, 2020, by which the high courts were asked to register suo motu (on its own motion) writ petitions to monitor trials against MPs and MLAs, and asked them to examine the cases of withdrawals, whether pending or disposed of, since September 16, 2020.Referring to a July 28-judgment by the top court in which the Kerala government’s move to withdraw cases against some of state’s sitting and former MLAs was snubbed, the bench emphasised: “The power under Section 321, CrPC, is a responsibility which is to be utilised in public interest, and cannot be used for extraneous and political considerations. This power is required to be utilised with utmost good faith to serve the larger public interest.”The court further directed that all trial judges hearing the criminal cases against MPs and MLAs in special courts shall continue in their present posts till its further orders. To this end, the registrar general of all 25 high courts were asked to submit details of judges hearing such cases in the special courts, status of pendency, judgments delivered, and other details.The directions were issued while hearing a plea filed by advocate Ashwini Upadhyaya, who cited staggering pendency of criminal cases against MPs and MLAs and sought their expeditious disposal by setting up special courts.Amicus curiae senior advocate Vijay Hansaria, assisted by advocate Sneha Kalita, implored the bench that no prosecution should be allowed to be withdrawn under Section 321, CrPC, against a sitting or former member of Parliament or a member of legislative assembly/council without the permission of the high court.Hansaria listed out instances from Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Maharashtra where orders under Section 321 CrPC were issued.In Karnataka, a government order sought to withdraw 61 criminal cases, many of which were filed against sitting MLAs of the state. Uttar Pradesh similarly chose to withdraw prosecution last year against political leader Sadhvi Prachi and three sitting MLAs – Sangeet Som, Suresh Rana and Kapil Dev -- for making inflammatory statements during the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots. The amicus cited news reports to state that withdrawal of prosecution was applicable to 76 criminal cases related to the riots.Another report from Maharashtra indicated that the state government decided in December last year to withdraw political cases against activists registered prior to December 31, 2019.In June, the Andhra Pradesh high court took suo motu cognisance of 11 separate orders passed by various magistrates allowing withdrawal of prosecution in criminal cases pending against chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy. This case, however, was not cited by the amicus in his report.According to an analysis of candidate affidavits by the not-for-profit Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), the share of MPs with declared criminal cases against them has been increasing in the last decade. It stood at 30% in 2009 and 43% in 2019.Hansaria relied on the July 28 judgment that legislators do not have immunity from criminal law while clearing the decks for the prosecution of some of Kerala’s sitting and former MLAs who threw furniture and destroyed computers and microphones during a House proceeding in 2015.During the proceedings, the court also pulled up the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for not submitting details of cases the agency is prosecuting against MPs and MLAs. The bench read out its orders since September 2020 when the CBI was repeatedly asked to submit a status report but to no avail.“We have no words now. We have already said everything we could. We have to only presume certain things now... We asked the government of India about their seriousness and we were told that the government is very much serious about completion of trials against MPs and MLAs but there is nothing you have done. We can say this much,” it told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for CBI.On his part, the S-G said that the government was committed to expeditious completion of trials against the elected representatives and asked for a final opportunity to file the report.“We are giving you the last opportunity. If you don’t do it now, we will assume you have nothing to say,” retorted the bench as it fixed August 25 as the next date of hearing.The CJI also indicated that a special bench will be constituted to regularly monitor the progress made in ensuring speedy trials of MPs and MLAs, in which there is already a direction of the top court in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-nod-a-must-to-drop-cases-on-politicians-supreme-court-101628639130319.html
11-08-2021||India||HC asks Centre to respond to state’s request for 3.5 mn vaccines per week||Bengaluru: The Karnataka high court on Tuesday directed the Government of India to consider state’s request for 3.5 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine per week. The direction came after the Karnataka government submitted before the court that the state would be able to provide vaccination to all beneficiaries within three months if 3.5 million doses of vaccines are provided to the state every week. The state claimed that the government is capable of vaccinating 500,000 people per day and the demand for 3.5 million vaccination per day is based on this calculation. The state stated that as of August 5, the government has received a total of 20.7 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines, out of which 204,000 doses are Covishield and 3.49 million are that of Covaxin. It is also said that the total eligible beneficiaries in the state who are above 18 years of age are 40.9 million and the total doses administered as of August 5, are 30.2 million. A division bench of Chief Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar said, “If some state government is able to achieve the tall target, the Government of India shall welcome that and assist it.” The court suggested that, “There is no clarity on the effectiveness of Covaxin and Covishiled, if the vaccines are effective for a limited period, necessary provisions shall be made for providing further doses in the action plan.” The court also directed the Government of India to respond on this point. Meanwhile, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Tuesday gave a slew of directions to the police including maintaining a tight vigil in the districts bordering neighbouring states where the Covid-19 cases are on the rise. He also directed them to have zero tolerance towards crime and crack down on drug cases. Hailing the police force in the state for their exemplary work during a review meeting at the Vidhana Soudha, Bommai directed the officials to create a peaceful environment in the state. The chief minister also laid emphasis on containing Covid-19 to avoid the third wave. “Action has to be taken to prevent the possible Covid third wave. Precautions have to be taken at the border districts. Senior officers will have to work more responsibly. Inspection at the check posts in borders will be mandatory,” a statement issued by the chief minister’s office said. Revenue minister R Ashok, in charge of pandemic management in Bengaluru on Monday, said tough measures to control the spread of the virus will be imposed in the city after August 15. When questioned whether this would mean weekend curfews and closure of economic activity, he said nothing can be ruled out and decisions will be taken based on the evolving situation. “The vaccination rate in the city is good, which we hope will reduce the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the city, even if the cases shoot up,” he said.Meanwhile, after restrictions on people arriving from Kerala, the Chamarajanagar district administration has now made it mandatory for travellers from Tamil Nadu to furnish negative Covid-19 reports that are not older than 72 hours at the time of arrival. The decision comes in the wake of fresh cases rising in the neighbouring state. The negative report rule for travellers from Tamil Nadu will kick in from Sunday. Chamarajanagar district administration has intensified screening of people at Punajanur checkpost, Naal Road near Ardhanipura and the checkpost at Palar in Hanur taluk on the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border. Travellers who do not submit Covid-19 negative reports on arrival will be turned back. The rule also applies to drivers of vehicles carrying fruit and vegetables and other essential commodities between the states. However, those who have been fully vaccinated (both doses) are exempted, but they must produce their vaccination certificate at the border to enter. Health authorities are also thermal screening travellers at check-posts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-asks-centre-to-respond-to-state-s-request-for-3-5-mn-vaccines-per-week-101628624543703.html
11-08-2021||India||Will CM Bommai continue on the path followed by BSY in K’taka?||In the first week of April 2020, former Karnataka chief minister and one of the founding members of the BJP in the state, BS Yediyurappa, was trolled by several right-wing social media accounts. The reason for the outrage was Yediyurappa’s statement in support of the Muslim community. “Nobody should speak a word against Muslims. This is a warning. If anyone blames the entire Muslim community for some isolated incident, I’ll act against them also without a second thought. Will not allow that to happen,” he said on April 6, 2020, against the hate campaign targeting the state’s Muslim community over the Covid pandemic and Tablighi Jamaat event held in Delhi in April 2020,which turned into a super-spreader. Despite being one of the oldest members of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in the state, the perception remained that Yediyurappa didn’t represent the right-wing ideology of the party. With his exit from chief minister’s post, the question remains whether this would make way for more right-wing influenced policies in the state, especially since BJP leaders in Karnataka have proposed a law against inter-faith marriages (termed love jihad by RSS) and population control laws, which are perceived as anti-minority, or a softer BJP, which Yediyurappa showcased, would continue. Experts and party insiders say that Yediyurappa’s presence didn’t make a big impact on the implementation of the BJP’s right-wing agenda. “I really don’t understand the notion that Yediyurappa is secular. If he was secular, how did the anti-cow slaughter bill go through? You are talking about an instance where he spoke for the Muslim community during the Tablighi (Jamaat) incident. Did you know Karnataka registered the highest number of sedition cases, most of them against the minorities, during Yediyurappa’s time?” asked a Bengaluru-based lawyer, who didn’t want to be named. A senior bureaucrat who worked with Yediyurappa, disagreed and said that the former chief minister indeed had more secular ideas compared to the RSS faction of the party. However, he added that he didn’t take a stand against the RSS at any point. “Let us look at the Mangaluru incident. During the anti-CAA (Citizenship Amazement Act) three people were shot dead (on December 19, 2019). Yediyurappa’s initial reaction was to reach out to a member of the (Muslim) community to bring the situation under control. He even announced a compensation of ₹10 lakh,” pointed out a bureaucrat from Karnataka, who didn’t want to be named. He added that even though Yediyurappa’s first reaction may sound secular, it didn’t last long. “Within two days, the compensation offer was withdrawn. Even though he could have taken a stand when there was pressure on him, he listened to what he was told,” said the IAS officer. The difference between Yediyurappa and Basavaraj Bommai, according to political analyst A Narayana, is that Yediyurappa had a stature in the party to say no to policy decisions that came with a right-wing agenda. “It was not because it was a right-wing agenda or because he believed less in Hindutva. It is because he had a mind of his own and he didn’t like being told what to do. At the end of the day, he is an RSS man. Most importantly he was suspicious of everyone,” said Narayana. Bommai, whose rose from socialist ranks in Janata Dal and replaced Yediyurappa as chief minister, has been known to taking controversial, right-wing stances. During the anti-CAA protest in October 2019, Bommai had called the protestors traitors, and had announced that the state would undertake the controversial National Registry of Citizens (NRC) even before the central government announced it. “Unlike Yediyurappa, Bommai doesn’t have the stature to speak against a decision made by the RSS or the central high command. If Hindutva becomes a bigger campaign issue for the BJP in the upcoming elections, there wouldn’t be any resistance from Bommai in implementing any decisions,” said Narayana. However, those aware of the developments suspect Yediyurappa to be in charge despite the change in leadership and is likely to have a big say in how things play out in the state. The core-BJP legislators or those who identify closely with the saffron outfit’s Hindutva agenda have met with the central leadership even during Yediyurappa’s administration to demand that more bills like anti-love jihad law are introduced that are in line with the Sangh’s vision for the state, people aware of the developments said. Despite the experts and activists questioning Yediyurappa’s secular credentials, party insiders feel that Yediyurappa has largely remained a secular face when compared to his contemporaries like KS Eshwarappa, which is likely to make it harder for the Bommai government to introduce such bills, people aware of the developments said. Yediyurappa’s unwillingness to toe the line against minorities and disagreeing with provocative statements made by his own party men has also been one of the reasons why the 78-year-old was considered a misfit for BJP’s hardline and long-term vision for Karnataka and its other plans for southern India. “Yediyurappa was never into communal politics or seen to be siding with them like Eshwarappa,” said one north-Karnataka-based political analyst, requesting not to be named. Yediyurappa, the analyst, said was also forced to take a tough stance against Tipu Sultan Jayanthi celebrations which the former had earlier endorsed. He added that the BJP is unlikely to take risks to introduce more hardcore bills in a state where the political situation remains volatile and uncertain, especially since Yediyurappa has the influence to get legislators to back away from even bringing up such bills. “Yediyurappa has a way to get legislators, even those against him, to do what he wants them to do,” said another Bengaluru-based analyst, also requesting anonymity. The analyst was referring to the likes of Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal), the firebrand legislator and ardent critic of Yediyurappa, who tried to push for Hindutva but instead was seen as one of the leading forces of the Panchamasali, the largest sub-sect within the Lingayats, agitation seeking for better reservation status. Yediyurappa, like his counterparts in the Congress (Siddaramaiah) and Janata Dal (Secular) (HD Deve Gowda) are known to be coalition builders that have seen them almost rotate power among themselves without allowing Delhi to dictate terms in the state. The three leaders have struck regional alliances, with or without their respective high command’s approval, when convenient and have depended on each other for passage of bills and winning elections among others for mutual benefit. “In some ways, I think the new government will very much like to distance itself from the former chief minister and do it gradually and without ruffling of too many feathers,” Sandeep Shastri, a political commentator and psephologist said. He added that in Karnataka, the BJP has always had to walk a “tight-rope” and that a significant chunk of the BJP’s legislators (and Cabinet) comprises people who have come into the fold not more than a decade ago including Bommai, who joined the BJP only 13 years ago and have no strong roots with the ideological side of the party. Shasti added that the BJP will be more pragmatic given the nature of the composition of the state legislature party. “In a state assembly election, BJP have never been able to get a clear majority so they (BJP) would be more keen on strengthening their base in the state rather than doing anything else at this stage,” Shastri said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-cm-bommai-continue-on-the-path-followed-by-bsy-in-ktaka-101628624423850.html
11-08-2021||India||CM Bommai bats for ‘a new vision’ for Bengaluru city||Bengaluru Taking a cue from his predecessors, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Tuesday too batted for Bengaluru saying that it requires a ‘new vision’. “A new vision for Bengaluru has to happen. Ongoing works should speed up, (should be) time-bound and efficient, and the factor of corruption shouldn’t be there. Only then can we do justice to the people or we won’t be able to meet people’s expectations,” Bommai said on Tuesday. The statements comes at a time when Bengaluru, one of India’s most industrious cities, continues to suffer on account of government apathy, maladministration and corruption in public works that has piled on the problems of its over 12 million residents. Bommai’s predecessor, Yediyurappa, launched the “Mission 2022” to beautify the central parts of Bengaluru, as an image building exercise, rather than fix the underlying problems of a city that aspires to be a global centre. Some of the biggest corporations in the world have a presence in Bengaluru, in sectors like Information Technology, start-ups, aerospace and biotechnology among others, but the city’s infrastructure has barely caught up with its economic prowess. Bommai said that all the ministers, legislators and officials’ views should be considered in trying to take the city forward. Most of Bengaluru’s roads are dug up and pose a threat to pedestrians and motorists, especially during monsoons when the roads turn slushy and slippery. Bommai said that action is being taken to bring Bengaluru city corporation under the Fiscal Responsibility Act to initiate projects based on the factual situation in BBMP.During the meeting, Bommai instructed officials to repair non-functional borewells, transform 3 lakh street lights into LED lights during weekends, repair damaged roads and also moored for a separate discussion to be held on establishment of separate Authority for the development, management and traffic management of 860 kms of arterial and sub-arterial roads.Bengaluru generates over half of the state’s income and also takes up a lion’s share of its expenditure, which has forced governments to continue its excessive focus on the city that has grown rapidly and in an unplanned manner over the last two decades. The excessive focus on Bengaluru has also led to regional imbalance in Karnataka. Although other states across India have similar problems where one or two urban centres get all the attention, the situation could not be more pronounced than in Karnataka where most parts of the arid and calamity-prone state get little or nothing in terms of expenditure. But despite getting thousands of crores in allocations every year, Bengaluru’s already inadequate infrastructure has been crumbling with poor quality of roads, unending traffic snarls, inefficient waste management, polluted lakes and dipping quality of air and water for its residents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-bommai-bats-for-a-new-vision-for-bengaluru-city-101628624243702.html
11-08-2021||India||Eshwarappa courts controversy again, slams Cong leader with derogatory remark||Two days after making a controversial statement encouraging Bharatiya Janata Party workers to “hit back with the same strength” if any party worker is harmed, Karnataka minister KS Eshwarappa courted controversy again on Tuesday. While talking to the media, the minister used a derogatory term to describe Congress leaders. Moments after uttering the word, he apologized and asked the media not to play it up, however, the Congress party took strong objection to the minister’s statement. “...Why I am using this term is because they don’t have any idea what to utter and what to omit,” Eshwarappa, who holds the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj portfolio, said during the press briefing. Eshwarappa’s outburst came following a query from a journalist that someone from Congress had called him a joker. Responding to this, the minister said Congress leader Siddaramaiah had demanded that a Dalit leader should be made chief minister. “Since independence, the Congress had been in power but why they did not make any Dalit a chief minister. Should we give them any weightage?” Eshwarappa said. “Let them say now who is joker whether Congress, BJP or Eshwarappa?” he said. This statement began with the derogatory word. Taking strong exception, former chief minister Siddaramaiah described Eshwarappa as a man lacking culture. “Only a man without culture can use such words. Eshwarappa does not have culture,” Siddaramaiah told reporters in Mysuru on Tuesday. The minister’s outburst also drew a sharp reaction from senior Congress leader B K Hariprasad. “I appeal to health minister K Sudhakar to get Eshwarappa admitted to NIMHANS, the world-famous mental and neurological institute located in Bengaluru, at the earliest and get him the best treatment there,” Hariprasad said. The minister was in the news when he said during a party workers’ meet at Shivamogga on Sunday that the BJP workers could give back in equal measure when rivals attacked them. “Today, the BJP has grown the world over, and if a BJP worker is touched anywhere in any corner, the instruction is to hit back with the same stick. In the past, the decision was to stay calm at all costs... We have become very strong,” Eshwarappa had said. Defending his statement on Monday, Eshwarappa told reporters “Do we have to be silent even if our women are raped? Our cows are stolen and killed, and our youth assaulted and killed -- you want us to remain silent?” At the Sunday meeting, the minister also told party workers that there was a time when Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological mentor of the party, and BJP top leaders used to ask party workers “to stay calm at all costs”, but now the situation has changed. “... We had to be calm, irrespective of the situation and how much we were attacked. We did not have the strength.” Following this statement on Monday, a lawyer and RTI activist Bheemanagouda Paragonda has sent a letter to governor Thaawarchand Gehlot seeking action against Eshwarappa. The lawyer has also urged the Governor to remove Eshwarappa from the Cabinet and to direct the state government to initiate criminal proceedings against him. “The minister’s statements are not only immoral and uncivilized but also illegal, the complaint said. They violate criminal laws under IPC Sections 153 A and B, 295, 505, 509, and under the Cr.PC, the People’s Representation Act, and other laws,” the lawyer told the media on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eshwarappa-courts-controversy-again-slams-cong-leader-with-derogatory-remark-101628624063731.html
11-08-2021||India||SC grants bail to Azam Khan, son in forgery case||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday granted bail to senior Samajwadi Party leader and former Uttar Pradesh minister Azam Khan and his son, Mohammad Abdullah, in a forgery case and held that the duo will be released only after the trial court has recorded the statement of the complainant in the case. The court directed the trial court to complete this exercise within four weeks and file a compliance report before the top court.Khan and his son approached the top court after they were denied bail by the Allahabad high court in November 2020. The case against them was filed on the basis of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Akash Saxena’s complaint in 2019. Saxena has accused Azam Khan of obtaining forged identity documents such as a PAN card and Passport for his son to enable him to fight the 2017 assembly elections. A person needs to be aged above 25 to contest elections.The prosecution alleged that the original birth certificate of Abdullah showed his date of birth as January 1, 1993. But to be eligible to contest elections, he obtained a new birth certificate showing his date of birth as September 30, 1991. The charge sheet filed in the case accused the duo of forging PAN card and Passport to establish the changed date of birth.Appearing for the Uttar Pradesh government, additional solicitor general (ASG) SV Raju described Azam Khan as a “habitual forger” and cited a case of grabbing enemy property land using forged land records pending against him. In all, Azam Khan has 87 criminal cases pending against him while his son has 41 pending cases.In this particular case pertaining to offences of cheating, forgery, criminal conspiracy punishable under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120B, the apex court noted that it was a fit case for bail as Azam Khan was arrested in this case in February 2020 and since then, investigation had been completed and charge sheet filed in May last year.The bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and Sanjiv Khanna said, “This is a case based on documentary evidence. Is it fair to keep a person in custody when there is evidence on both sides? Already the courts are overflowing with cases, and delay is a systematic problem unless you can assure that the trial will be completed within a fixed time.”Raju said the accused had moved an application seeking discharge in this case, which is listed on Wednesday before the trial court. He claimed that the “accused is influential, and witnesses are scared of him,” and sought protection for the complainant whose statement is yet to be recorded by the trial court.The bench in its order said, “We deem it appropriate to direct release of appellants on bail in connection with FIR 980/2019 after the statement of informant is recorded by the trial court.” The court asked the state to ensure the informant is produced in trial court on August 16 and directed the trial court to record his statement/evidence within four weeks and report compliance.The bench directed Khan and his son to extend full cooperation for the recording of evidence and asked them to abide by all strict conditions to be imposed by the trial court of not influencing witnesses or tampering with prosecution evidence.Senior advocates Kapil Sibal and S Wasim Qadri appeared for the two accused and argued that this was a case of “political vendetta” as multiple “cases were forged against the two accused without reason”. Sibal said that Khan has been granted bail in 85 out of 87 FIRs. “The manner in which the state is pursuing FIRs against the appellant shows they have no other work,” Sibal said, arguing that Section 219 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) allows common trial of similar offences against the same person.The bench asked ASG Raju, “The core issue in all these FIRs relates to date of birth. If you show that the second birth certificate is false, you will succeed. Multiplicity of evidence is not going to help you. Even the court system will be unnecessarily burdened. Why can’t you club the trials in all the FIRs into one.”The law officer sought time to take instructions in this regard even as he opposed saying that the accused and the nature of offence in all these cases are different. The court posted the matter after two weeks for consideration of this aspect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-grants-bail-to-azam-khan-son-in-forgery-case-101628623583783.html
11-08-2021||India||₹406 crore grains lost in storage: House panel||India lost ₹406 crore worth of grains procured by the government due to damage during storage in state-run granaries in the past three years, data cited in a parliamentary standing committee report has revealed.Besides, cereals worth ₹1.39 crore were stolen or pilfered between 2017 and 2021, data in the report shows.Operational norms assume there will be some loss while undertaking large procurement operations, but data cited in the parliamentary report shows the quantity of grains lost in storage exceeded the target set by the government.A rough calculation by HT, using tools in the website caloriecontrol.org, shows ₹406 crore worth of grains is sufficient to feed half of India’s Census-recorded 1.7 million homeless people on a bare minimum 1,200-calorie diet for a quarter.“The (food) Ministry further stated that during storage of foodgrains scientific code of practices for safe storage is followed. Inspite (sic) of all precautions, some quantity of foodgrains may get damaged/become non-issuable due to various reasons such as storage pests’ attack, leakages in godowns, procurement of poor quality stocks, exposure to rains, floods, negligence on the part of concerned persons in taking precautionary measures etc,” the parliamentary standing committee on food’s report on procurement and storage by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) said.Procurement refers to the government’s buying of cereals at benchmark minimum support prices from farmers.Foodgrains procured by the government are either stored on covered platforms or covered and plinth method of storage, where sacks of food are stockpiled on raised platforms, apart from silos.In 2019-20, the government targeted to limit losses to 0.07% of the total grains bought by it, while actual losses were higher at 0.10%. In percentage terms, the value looks small because the government procures large quantities, but in absolute terms, the quantities lost are significant.For instance, during 2019-20, slightly over 100,000 tonnes of wheat were lost in storage, while in 2020-21, another nearly 100,000 tonnes were spoiled.The government procured 86.9 million tonnes of paddy during 2020-21 and 43.3 million tonnes of wheat in the current year, which is the highest-ever quantity procured.“Physical measures like installation of barbed wire fencing of the boundary walls, provision of streetlights for illumination of godowns and proper locking of the sheds are taken to secure the godowns,” the report said.The FCI explained the loss. “The FCI has brought down the percentage of grains damaged or declared non-issuable (to consumers) considerably from about 0.047% in 2013-14. We maintain proper records of non-issuable grains. Some damage is inevitable due to natural moisture loss as a result of the long time difference between procurement and distribution,” an official overseeing procurement in the food agency said, requesting anonymity.According to the report, there are provisions for “strict disciplinary action” against FCI staff responsible for “unjustified losses” from FCI depots.“Where negligence is the cause, strict departmental action is taken after investigation,” the FCI official added.Dipa Sinha, a food security expert at Ambedkar University in Delhi found it shocking that the government has lost much grain that could have fed so many people. “The government should make the public distribution system universal and secure every grain it procures,” she said.In the 2020 Global Hunger Index, India ranked 94 among 107 countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-406-cr-grains-lost-in-storage-house-panel-101628621965249.html
11-08-2021||India||Centre rejects panel’s idea to try 16+ as adults under Pocso||The government has turned down the suggestion of the parliamentary panel on Home Affairs to charge as adults, those over the age of 16 involved in cases of child sexual assault, according to the action taken report tabled by the committee in Parliament on Tuesday.Anyone under the age of 18 is treated as a juvenile in India.The Ministry of Women and Child Development told the panel that the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, (JJ Act), 2015 is the primary legislation for children in need of care and protection (CNCP) and children in conflict with law. “Child accused of crime under POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act is protected under the provisions of JJ Act, 2015 based on principal of restorative justice. The JJ Act, 2015 empowers Juvenile Justice Board to decide upon matters of children in conflict with law,” the government said in its reply to the panel.The government’s position is that offences committed by children have been categorised as “petty, serious and heinous offences” and the provision to try them as adults already exists under the JJ Act. “The JJ Act, 2015 also includes procedure to decide upon cases where children above the age of sixteen years have been alleged to have committed a heinous offence.”Hindustan Times first reported on March 11 that the committee recommended the lowering of age from 18 years to 16 years for trying people as adults under the POCSO Act -- a move prompted by a desire to reverse the trend of increasing crimes against children, including some committed by juveniles. The committee noted that cases registered under POCSO rose from 32,608 in 2017 to 47,325 in 2019 , an increase of nearly 45% in two years , and made important recommendations to check cyber crime, improve the condition of sex workers and increase police accountability in cases of crimes against women.The recommendation caused much consternation among experts, who argued that reducing the age may end up penalizing consensual relationships between two minors.POCSO was enacted in 2012 to check mounting crimes against children and lists the maximum punishment as life imprisonment and death.The committee’s recommendation to set up a database of destitute women and children was well received by the government. “Ministry of Women and Child Development has taken note of the recommendation and would make endeavour for putting in place database in consultation with relevant central Ministries and States/ UTs,” the government has said in its response.And the education ministry is in the process of reviewing another recommendation on ensuring that school books are gender sensitive, and has suggested that the home and education ministries ask the states to do the same.“The committee notes the reply of the Ministry of Education that the Department of Gender Studies of NCERT is in the process of reviewing its textbooks from a gender perspective. The committee would like to be apprised about the changes made during the last five years in the textbooks to promote gender equality.”The panel’s March report also focused on criminals using Virtual Private Network (VPNs) – which allow a user to mask their location – to access the dark web, bypass cyber security walls and remain anonymous. It recommended that the Union government permanently identify and block such VPNs. In its action taken report, the panel has noted the incomplete reply of the minister of electronics and information technology. “No information has been provided on coordination mechanisms with international agencies to block VPNs permanently and initiatives taken/proposed to strengthen the tracking and surveillance mechanisms to put a check on the use of VPN and the dark web. The MHA may put its efforts in getting such information from MeitY and furnish the same to the Committee,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-rejects-panel-s-idea-to-try-16-as-adults-under-pocso-101628621842756.html
11-08-2021||India||PM Modi seeks details of BJP MPs who skipped RS voting||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday sought details of lawmakers who were not present in Rajya Sabha on Monday when voting for a statutory resolution moved by several opposition MPs was held, a person aware of the details said.While addressing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) parliamentary party meeting, the prime minister took strong exception to the absence of certain lawmakers in the Upper House. The statutory resolution demanded that the tribunals reforms bill be sent to the select committee of the House. The resolution was put to vote and negated after only 44 MPs voted in favour of it and 79 against it. Modi asked parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi to submit the details of the missing MPs, the person quoted above said.“On earlier occasions too, the prime minister had instructed the MPs to remain present in the House. There is a standing instruction to be present when bills are taken up for passage. A whip has also been issued to the MPs to remain present in both the Houses this week as legislative business draws to a close,” a party functionary said, asking not to be named. At the meeting, Modi also asked the lawmakers to take up mass campaigns for eradication of malnutrition, encourage sports in their constituencies and create awareness about the golden card under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana. The card allows cashless treatment of the beneficiaries of the scheme, which was launched in 2018 to provide the poor free access to private healthcare. Modi said the lawmakers must ensure that social schemes aimed at providing nutrition are implemented on the ground, the first person quoted above said. After India’s performance in the Tokyo Olympics, Modi said there is a need to encourage the young to take up sports. “He said the MPs (members of Parliament) should ensure that there is provision for teaching games from the gram panchayat level upwards,” the person added. With seven medals, India recorded its highest ever tally in the Olympic Games.Union sports minister Anurag Thakur gave a presentation on India’s performance while his predecessor, Kiren Rijiju, who now holds the law portfolio, briefed lawmakers on the preparations for the event. The person cited above said external affairs minister S Jaishankar also made a presentation on the UNSC meeting. On Monday, Modi became the first Indian Prime Minister to preside over a meeting of the UNSC when he chaired an open debate on enhancing maritime security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-seeks-details-of-bjp-mps-who-skipped-rs-voting-101628621670006.html
11-08-2021||India||Reservation should continue as long as inequality exists: RSS gen secy||Calling caste-based reservation an instrument of affirmative action that has an important role to play in social justice and equality, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale said on Tuesday that reservation and reconciliation (among communities) have to go hand-in-hand. The RSS leader was speaking at the launch of a book, ‘Makers of Modern Dalit History’, authored by Guru Prakash Paswan and Sudarshan Ramabadran. There he said that the political, cultural, social and spiritual history of India will be incomplete and untrue without the Dalit contribution. Hosabale claimed his organisation and he himself are staunch supporters of caste-based reservation. He gave the example of western countries to buttress his argument. “...in Europe and America, there has been an effort at reconciliation on the part of the African blacks. Reservation and reconciliation both have to go hand-in-hand,” he said, adding that while reservation is a historical necessity, reconciliation is for the future. Hosabale also defended the Sangh from the charge levelled by opponents that it is against caste-based reservation in government jobs and educational institutions. He said the RSS has been at the forefront in denouncing casteism. “When we discuss the various aspects of the Dalit community and the Scheduled Tribe sections of the society, certain aspects invariably come to the fore. One of them is reservation. My organisation and I have been staunch supporters of reservation for decades. In 1980, when there was an anti-reservation movement on some campuses, we passed a resolution and organised a seminar in Patna,” Hosabale said.He said that the RSS has said “time and again” that “reservation is a historical necessity” and will be needed in India for many more decades as long as certain segments of the society experience any inequality. The RSS leader also referred to the sub-categorisation of castes within the Dalit community but said it is not for him to comment whether that is good or bad for society. “I stay in Uttar Pradesh and travel across the country, and I meet a lot of people across sections. I have felt… identity is not limited to Dalit itself; within Dalits, the question of identities is being deliberately raised by intellectuals. I am not saying whether I am for or against it; I am only making an observation. It is too early to say whether such a development is good for the society or not,” Hosabale said. The RSS functionary went on to say that social harmony and social justice are not political strategies but articles of faith for the Sangh. The RSS, which is the ideological fount of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, has been running samajik samarasta or social harmony campaigns to end discrimination on the basis of caste. The campaign had become the genesis for the BJP’s social engineering strategy where it aims to expand its base among the other backward castes that have been socially and economically deprived by giving them political representation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reservation-should-continue-as-long-as-inequality-exists-rss-gen-secy-101628621305609.html
11-08-2021||India||A science fair photo reunites sisters after 4 yrs in Hyderabad||Two orphan sisters, who were separated from their youngest sister in 2017, have been reunited after matching their DNA, officials said.A photo from a science fair and efforts of Hyderabad district officials and Telangana police helped the reunion. The 14-year-old and 12-year-old elder sisters finally stepped into a foster home in the city on Sunday along with their 8-year-old sister.The elder sisters were living with their father in Kukatpally while the youngest was living with her grandmother in Ameenpur. “After their father, a daily wage labourer, expired in 2017, locals handed over the two girls to an orphanage in Secunderabad,” said Akeshwar Rao, district welfare officer, Hyderabad, who played a key role in the reunion of the siblings.“Around the same time, their grandmother, who was begging in Ameenpur, passed away. The police found the eight-year-old roaming on the streets and shifted her to a CCI (child care institute) in that locality. In April 2020, she was shifted to a government-run social welfare institution in Ameerpet,” Rao said.The efforts to re-unite the girls started after the two elder sisters identified one of the girls in a picture as their younger sibling. “Earlier this year, we had a science fair. Some photos of the event were circulated to all the orphanages. This is when the two sisters told the caretakers that one of the girls in a photograph resembled their lost sister. On many occasions earlier, they had shared stories of their younger sister with their caretakers,” Rao said.“We checked the features mentioned by the girls about their sister. We then took the girl identified in the picture to meet the two. The eight-year-old was not able to recognise them.” The district welfare officer then requested Hyderabad collector Sweta Mohanty and commissioner of women development & child welfare D Divya to conduct a DNA test of all the girls, who gave their nod.“In a week’s time, DNA reports confirmed that three were sisters. We immediately shifted all the girls to the orphanage in Ameerpet last Sunday,” Rao said.“Every child in an orphanage craves for love and attention and the children are very happy to be reunited. They will soon be going to the same school,” he said.This is one of the many success stories of Telangana police who rescue children as part of Operation Muskaan. The initiative was launched in 2015 and so far over 22,000 children have been rescued from streets, factories and brick kilns. Special teams identify children from railway and bus stations, religious places and footpaths.Most of the kids, who hail from Odisha, Jharkhand and Nepal, are rescued and reunited with their families. The rest are sent to welfare or rescue homes. Two such drives were conducted in Hyderabad this year-- 388 children were rescued from the streets in January and 194 in July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-science-fair-photo-reunites-sisters-after-4-yrs-in-hyderabad-101628621245251.html
11-08-2021||India||DMK govt’s first budget session from Aug 13 to Sept 21||The first budget session of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) regime will begin on August 13, with the presentation of the revised budget for 2021-2022 by the finance minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan and it will conclude on September 21. The demands for grants for each department will be discussed for 23 days.The Business Advisory Council meeting chaired by Speaker M Appavu on Tuesday decided on the long duration of the session. The session has several firsts. After the revised budget is presented, on the following day, the minister for agriculture M R K Panneerselvam will present an exclusive Agriculture Budget, a first for the state. “The debate on both budgets will take place together for four days from August 16,” Appavu told reporters. The responses will be given on August 19. This is also the first digital budget as the Tamil Nadu government is aiming to go paperless. 234 desktops the assembly have been fixed for the legislators. While legislators will be trained to use the gadgets, hard copies will also be printed for their benefit. Following Himachal Pradesh and Odisha, Tamil Nadu wants to be at the forefront of the change to save trees and keep up with technological advancements, Appavu had told HT earlier. The MLAs will also be given a 9-inch tablet each at the budget session and they will continue to use it throughout their term for work related to their constituency and to raise demands using the tablet.Ahead of the local body polls scheduled for later this year, the budget is unlikely to have any major tax revisions. “Some of the announcements will have the DMK’s poll promises such as ₹1,000 handouts for women head of households,” said a DMK leader not wishing to be named. Rajan had on August 9 released a 112-page White Paper on Tamil Nadu Government’s Finances stating that the current levels of fiscal deficit are unsustainable. He pointed out that the state was losing revenue by not having revised the motor vehicle tax in 15 years and called for the rationalisation of property tax and electricity tax. But the revision in these taxes is unlikely to be reflected in this budget.From August 23, demands for grants for each department will be discussed and passed in the Tamil Nadu assembly. Former finance minister O Panneerselvam presented an interim budget earlier in February ahead of the assembly elections held on April 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dmkgovts-first-budget-session-from-aug-13-to-sept-21-101628621183350.html
11-08-2021||India||Row as police collect record ₹125cr in fine||The Kerala police have collected a whopping ₹125 crore fine against Covid-19 protocol violations in three months, a police official on condition of anonymity said on Tuesday, but the Opposition, activists and a former high court judge questioned the police’s conduct against the people of the state during the pandemic. About 1.75 million cases of violations were registered during the last three months, with one million cases of not wearing masks, half a million of not maintaining social distancing, and 250k cases of other offences, according to the official. Opposition parties in the Kerala assembly alleged that a free hand was given to law enforcers to implement the Covid regulations, which has resulted in a police raj on roads. Later, opposition members stormed out of the House protesting the CM’s clean chit to police. Many activists and former judges also came down heavily on police. “People need balm these days. Helpless, they are intimidated and robbed by police. This should end,” said former high court judge Kemal Pasha. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan justified the police action and said it was not right to generalise things, citing some aberrations. He told the assembly that charging a fine was not a sin and in the prevailing situation, tough decisions were needed. He said extremists, communal forces and anarchists are deliberately spreading lies. “Police are doing a yeomen service in pandemic times. Many of its personnel were down with Covid-19 but they maintained the rule of law,” he said. But opposition members said “police raj” was in place in the state and only Communist supporters are getting justice these days. “The CM has let loose policemen govern the state. Police atrocities are rampant in the state and he repeatedly gives good certificates to offending cops,” said opposition leader V D Satheesan.The opposition also raised police action on a tribal leader and his family members in Attapady, Palakkad, where the police raided the leader’s house and arrested him forcefully while many family members were hurt in the melee. But the CM justified the action saying the chieftain was summoned several times to the station on a private complaint but refused to come, which forced the police to act. Many alleged cases of police atrocities have surfaced over time, with reports of enforced protocol and penalisation of people in the name of regulations. An 18-year-old girl Gouri Nanda was booked recently when she questioned police officials who imposed a fine of ₹500 on an elderly woman who was standing outside an ATM in the Kollam district. A youth was fined ₹2,000 when he went to attend the last rites of one of his relatives but he was given a receipt of ₹500 only. Later, a civil police officer was suspended. A government doctor was slapped by a police constable in Alapuzha for not giving him due to preference at a vaccination point. In Kazakottam, on the outskirts of the capital city, a youth was allegedly beaten blue last Sunday for coming out of his house during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-as-police-collect-record-125cr-in-fine-101628621125486.html
11-08-2021||India||MPs with criminal cases increased in last decade: Report||According to an analysis of candidate affidavits by the not-for-profit Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), the share of MPs with declared criminal cases against them has been increasing in the last decade. Of the 543 winners analysed by ADR in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, 162 (30%) had declared criminal cases against them, with 76 (14%) having serious criminal cases against them. The share of MPs with criminal and serious criminal cases increased to 43% and 29%, according to an analysis of 539 winners in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. To be sure, at least some of such cases are politically motivated.In 2019, candidates with declared criminal cases against them had a 15.5% chance of winning compared to 4.7% for candidates without such cases against them.The trend remains the same across parties. In 2019, while 39% of the BJP’s winning candidates had a criminal case against them, this number was 57% for the Congress, 43% for the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and 41% for the All India Trinamool Congress.In two separate judgments on August 10, the Supreme Court asked political parties to publish pending criminal cases against their candidates within 48 hours of their nomination for the ticket, reiterating and strengthening its 2020 order. The court has also ruled that states cannot withdraw cases against MPs and MLAs without the corresponding high court’s nod, something that has become increasingly common.The first of these two judgments assumes that voters may not be aware of criminal antecedents of candidates . Research by political scientist Milan Vaishnav, the director of Carnegie South Asia at Washington DC, also featured in his book When Crime Pays, shows that this need not be the case. According to Vaishnav, voters actually find value in supporting ‘strongman’ candidates as they are more capable of delivering on voters’ expectations of navigating the local institutions.“The apex court’s order (on mandatory high court approval for dropping cases) is a positive step toward ensuring that no individual is above accountability”, Vaishnav said. “However, the ruling addresses the symptoms rather the cause of the disease. Ultimately, one has to grapple with the reasons parties give tickets to suspected criminals and voters lend them their support.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mps-with-criminal-cases-increased-in-last-decade-report-101628621064962.html
11-08-2021||India||Vigilance raids properties of Velumani, seizes ₹13L cash||In what is being termed by the opposition AIADMK as ruling-DMK government’s ‘political vendetta’, the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) of Tamil Nadu on Tuesday conducted more than 60 raids in residences, farm houses, offices linked to AIADMK heavyweight and former municipal administration minister S P Velumani, after registering a case against him on Monday of willfully abusing his official position in awarding contracts to his close associates, including his brother.Following search operations on Tuesday, the DVAC seized ₹1,308,500 in cash, fixed deposits of ₹2 crores, official records from the corporations, hard disks, incriminating documents including land registration and business transactions. “The raids are complete for now and he cooperated,” said a DVAC official who conducted searches at Chennai’s MLA hostel where Velumani was present.The FIR said that there has been cheating and criminal misappropriation of public money amounting to several crores of the Tamil Nadu government, and hence the accused have been booked under sections 120 B, r/w 420 IPC, 409 IPC, section 13(2) r/w 13(1)(c) and 13(1 )(d) of Prevention of Corruption Act r/w 109 IPC.DVAC filed the cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and the IPC was filed based on complaints filed by DMK MP RS Bharathi and anti-corruption NGO Arappor Iyakkam in 2018.Searches went on throughout the day at places belonging to Velumani, contractors and civic officers in Coimbatore, Chennai, Dindigul and Kancheepuram. “But no arrests so far,” said a senior DVAC official.Besides Velumani, 16 others, including his close associates and road contractors have been named as accused. The FIR said that Velumani allotted tenders worth ₹464 crores for work executed by the Greater Chennai Corporation, and ₹346.8 crores to Coimbatore Corporation for companies closely associated with him during the period between 2014 and 2018. Being the municipal administration minister, from 2014 to 2021, he was the administrative head of the municipal corporations. Investigations reveal that prima facie there is a cognisable offence that all the 17 and unknown officials of the civic bodies showed favouritism in awarding contracts for laying bituminous bus route roads, stormwater drains and providing staff nurses for an urban primary healthcare centre. Criminal misappropriation and violations were found during three stages of the tender process- bidding, negotiation and execution of work.While awarding these tender contracts, officials of the Chennai and Coimbatore municipalities “blatantly violated” several provisions of the state’s tender laws “under the influence and directions” of Velumani, the FIR said. The FIR analysed 10 companies that grew phenomenally in a short span and showed massive turnovers due to the alleged collusion. One of the companies, C R Construction had a turnover of ₹0.38 crores in the 2012-13 fiscal year, which grew to ₹43.56 crores in five years (2018-19).The FIR said that Velumani dishonestly and fraudulently misappropriated the funds involved in the tenders.Hailing from the Coimbatore district, he emerged as a powerful leader given his close proximity to former chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami, after he took over in 2017, following J Jayalalithaa’s death in 2016. Velumani enjoys a level of clout that he is dubbed locally as ‘Coimbatore chief minister’. He also draws huge support on the ground. Families from the lower social strata are known to approach him for help in jobs and education which he fulfils.This explains Velumani election as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for four straight polls since 2006 when he was first elected from the Perur constituency. He’s the incumbent MLA from the Thondamathur constituency and was recently elected as AIADMK’s whip in the assembly. Hundreds of AIADMK cadre protested in front of Velumani’s Coimbatore residence while raids were on.In a joint statement, Palaniswami and party coordinator O Panneerselvam called it DMK’s political vendetta. “We are ready to face the false accusations legally and politically. But without any proof, accusing someone of corruption is wrong,” the statement said.Velumani is the second AIADMK leader being raided by DVAC after a case was registered against former transport minister M R Vijayabhaskar in July.It all started when the DMK, while in opposition, submitted a list of corruption charges against the then AIADMK ministers, which included Velumani and Palaniswami, to Governor Banwarilal Purohit in December 2020. The party later made an election promise to establish a special court to prosecute ministers of the previous government on graft charges.A preliminary report in 2018 was submitted to the Madras high court in a sealed cover where the case is pending. When the case came up for hearing on 19 July this year, the court directed for further investigations to get to the bottom of the matter. Reports filed by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) have also highlighted the “injudicious awarding of tenders resulting in huge loss to the government”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vigilanceraids-properties-of-velumani-seizes-13l-cash-101628621063331.html
11-08-2021||India||OBC Bill passed in Lok Sabha with rare House unity||For the first time in the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament, a piece of legislation was tabled and passed unanimously without disruptions on Tuesday as the Lok Sabha approved the 127th Constitution Amendment bill to restore the right of states to identify and provide reservation benefits to other backward castes (OBC). The entire House supported the bill and debated for more than six hours even as furious protests continued in Rajya Sabha over the controversial farm laws. While 385 members voted for the bill, no one opposed it. Many parties, including those in Opposition as well as Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) allies, demanded that the current 50% cap on reservations should be lifted. Many leaders such as Janata Dal (United) MP Lalan Singh, Samajwadi Party’s Akhilesh Yadav, Bahujan Samaj Party’s Ritesh Pandey and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s T R Baalu also demanded a caste census be conducted throughout the country. Social justice and empowerment minister Virendra Kumar, who replaced Thawarchand Gehlot a month ago, described the bill as a “historic legislation” that would benefit 671 castes in the country. He said the bill will restore the states’ rights to prepare their own lists of OBCs so that various communities can be given social and economic justice.”I am grateful to all the members of the Lok Sabha for strengthening the federal structure of India,” he tweeted. On May 5, while scrapping a separate quota for the Maratha community in Maharashtra, the Supreme Court had ruled that after a 2018 amendment in the Constitution, only the central government could notify socially and educationally backward classes (SEBCs) – not the states.This interpretation effectively struck a blow to the authority of state governments in identifying backward classes and provide them with reservation benefits. The new bill effectively bypasses the Supreme Court’s decision.The Centre’s position has all along been that the President’s powers in identifying and categorising SEBCs is restricted to the central list. BJP’s first speaker on the bill, Sanghmitra Maurya, pitched for caste census and lauded the government for deciding in its support. Her speech left many BJP members confused as the ruling party has so far not accepted growing Opposition demand for a caste census. Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury extended his party’s full support to the bill but criticised the government for the 2018 amendment, saying the situation could have been averted had the government listened to the Opposition. “You tweaked the Constitution by bringing the 102 Constitution Amendment Bill in 2018 which gave people opportunity to go to the court and finally the Supreme Court removed the states’ power,” he said. Chowdhury and some Opposition leaders also slammed the government for not debating the Pegasus snooping controversy. “We support this bill but our demand is to remove 50% ceiling (in reservation). You should listen to states, make it legal for states to cross the 50 per cent ceiling,” Chowdhury said. The 50% cap is the result of a landmark 1992 Supreme Court verdict and the top court refused to tinker with it earlier this year. DMK’s Baalu and SP’s Yadav also demanded the removal of 50% ceiling. Labour and employment minister Bhupender Yadav asserted that the Narendra Modi government took many measures quickly to ensure justice for Dalits, OBCs and the poor. Hitting out at the Congress, Yadav said the Constitution makers had made a provision for reservation for backward classes, but when the Congress came to power in 1950, it ruled for 40 years but did not give justice to the backward classes. “When for the first time a non-Congress government came to power, the Mandal Commission was created. It had submitted its report in 1980 and you (the Congress) ran the government after that but did not implement it and did not give reservation to backward classes,” Yadav said. NCP’s Supriya Sure (NCP) said the credit for this amendment bill should be given to the Maharashtra government which requested the Centre to do address the issue of OBC reservation. She also advocated for removing the 50% ceiling. YSR Congress and Shiv Sena also voiced their support for the bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/obc-bill-passed-in-lok-sabha-with-rare-house-unity-101628620943710.html
11-08-2021||India||‘Nation losing patience’: Supreme Court on criminalisation of politics||The nation continues to wait and is losing patience, said the Supreme Court on Tuesday as it made an “appeal to the conscience of the lawmakers hoping that they will wake up soon and carry out a major surgery for weeding out the malignancy of criminalisation in politics,” which, it added, was “growing day by day.”Expressing anguish over the non-compliance by various political parties with its 2020 judgment on the disclosure of criminal antecedents of candidates being put up by them, the top court lamented that its exhortations for amending laws to prohibit involvement of persons with criminal antecedents “have fallen on the deaf ears”.“The political parties refuse to wake up from deep slumber... Cleansing the polluted stream of politics is obviously not one of the immediate pressing concerns of the legislative branch of government,” said the bench of justices Rohinton F Nariman and BR Gavai, maintaining that the court’s hands are tied due to constitutional scheme of separation of powers that entitles only parliament to make laws and the courts cannot legislate.The court’s remarks came as it held the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Janata Dal (United), the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Congress, among others, guilty of contempt for not complying with its directions regarding complete disclosure of criminal antecedents of candidates put up by them during the Bihar assembly elections in 2020, and imposed a fine of ₹1 lakh on each.The Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Nationalist Congress Party were asked to cough up ₹5 lakh each for not following the court’s directions “at all”.The bench said that the political parties, which also included Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and Communist Party of India, shall deposit the money in a fund that will be created by the Election Commission of India (ECI) for an “extensive awareness campaign to make every voter aware about his right to know and the availability of information regarding criminal antecedents of all contesting candidates”.It directed ECI to create a dedicated mobile application containing information about criminal antecedents of the candidates so as to enable voters access such information conveniently.The apex poll body, ordered the bench, shall also create a separate cell to monitor compliance by political parties with the court’s directions issued in February 2020 regarding disclosure of criminal backgrounds of their candidates, and bring all instances of breach to the court’s attention.The top court, which earlier directed political parties to put out information about the cases pending against their candidates on their websites, further ordered that the parties will now create a new caption -- “candidates with criminal antecedents” on the home page of their websites to make it easier for the voter to get to the information.The court also modified its 2020 direction, in which it obligated the parties to publish the details within 48 hours of the selection of the candidate or not less than two weeks before the first date for filing of nominations, whichever was earlier. It acknowledged the ground reality that in most of the cases the candidates are finalised by the political parties between the period commencing from the date of notification till the last date of withdrawal, saying the details can be published by the parties within 48 hours of the selection of the candidate, and not prior to two weeks before the first date of filing of nominationsThe bench was hearing a contempt petition filed by advocate Brajesh Singh, who alleged wilful disobedience of court orders by various political parties during the Bihar assembly elections in 2020.Singh’s petition cited a Supreme Court judgment in February 2020 that made it mandatory for all political parties to put up on their websites and publish in two newspapers information regarding the pending criminal cases against candidates being fielded by them, and the reasons for selecting them. Singh contended that several parties failed to put in public domain the details of criminal antecedents of their candidates, apart from just citing their winnability as the factor for picking them.As per the information submitted by Bihar chief electoral officer’s counsel Siddhartha Prasad, there were 427 candidates with criminal antecedents who contested the assembly elections in Bihar in 2020. The RJD topped the list with 104 tainted candidates, followed by the BJP, which fielded 77 such candidates.Assisted by senior advocate KV Viswanathan as amicus curiae (friend of the court), the bench noted that most of the political parties have either not given full disclosure, or have not followed the format in which the information was to be given.It said that the political parties are in contempt of the court’s February 2020 judgment, but a lenient view is being adopted and they were let off with a fine because these were the first elections conducted after issuance of the directions. “However, we warn them that they should be cautious in future and ensure that the directions issued by this Court as well as the ECI are followed in letter and spirit,” added the bench.Viswanathan and ECI’s counsel, senior advocate Vikas Singh, had urged the court to issue certain directions regarding withdrawal of election symbols from the parties for flouting the court’s directions and disqualifying those with serious criminal charges. The bench, however, expressed its inability to pass such orders, clarifying these subjects were within the remit of the legislature and the laws will have to be amended to include such disqualifications.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nation-losing-patience-sc-on-criminalisation-of-politics-101628620583327.html
11-08-2021||India||Centre gives nod to Covaxin plant in Gujarat||The Centre on Tuesday approved Bharat Biotech’s manufacturing facility at Ankleshwar in Gujarat to produce Covaxin, the company’s anti-Covid vaccine, the Union health ministry announced.“Govt of India approves vaccine manufacturing facility for production of @BharatBiotech’s #Covaxin in Ankleshwar, Gujarat. Following PM @NarendraModi ji’s vision of #SabkoVaccineMuftVaccine, this will increase vaccine availability & accelerate the world’s largest vaccine drive,” tweeted Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya.According to people familiar with the matter, vaccine doses from this facility are likely to be out for use by September. Close to six million doses are likely to be produced in the Ankleshwar plant that earlier manufactured anti-rabies vaccines.The overall Covaxin production capacity is going to be scaled up to close to 60 million doses a month around the last quarter of this year.Currently, doses from Bharat Biotech’s Hyderabad facility are being supplied for the country’s Covid-19 immunisation programme. Apart from the Gujarat facility, Bharat Biotech has also refurbished its Malur plant in Karnataka to produce Covaxin doses to scale up production.Even though the company did not respond to queries, in an earlier statement it said, “Products manufactured from these facilities will be available for supplies during September. This is based on our 120-day timeline for manufacturing, testing, release, regulatory approvals, and distribution.”With a couple of other public sector undertakings (PSU) also being roped in for manufacturing Covaxin doses, the production number of Covaxin is projected to increase from the current 25 million doses a month to at least 58 million doses. The Union health minister disclosed this in Parliament earlier this month.According to Bharat Biotech, each batch of Covaxin undergoes over 200 quality control tests before being submitted to Central Drugs Laboratory for testing. The company has so far supplied at least 70 million doses for the immunisation programme.Vinod Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, had said earlier in a press briefing on Covid-19 updates that the national vaccination programme may start getting about 2 million doses from Indian Immunologicals Limited, a PSU, by late August or September.“… it will take some time for production to begin at the Haffkine, BIBCOL (Bharat Immunologicals Biologicals Limited), and Gujarat consortium as substantive infrastructure is being built, modified, or repurposed in these plants. Broadly, the activation of the PSUs will happen in November or December,” he had said.Vaccine availability will further increase in the country with vaccines from Moderna and Johnson & Johnson receiving emergency use authorisation in India, and another made-in-India vaccine, Zydus Cadila’s ZyCov-D, likely to get necessary approvals soon.There are five Covid-19 vaccines that India has authorised for emergency use. The other two are Serum Institute of India’s Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine that is being locally produced under the brand name Covishield, and the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/studying-need-for-booster-shots-govt-101628620464345.html
11-08-2021||India||All parties must come together and save India: Kapil Sibal||On Monday night, the Congress’s Rajya Sabha MP and former Union minister Kapil Sibal hosted several Opposition leaders across parties -- including Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, National Conference leader Omar Abdullah, Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad, and leaders from the Biju Janata Dal, the Trinamool Congress, the Shiv Sena, the Left parties, the Shiromani Akali Dal, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, the YSR Congress, and others.From the Congress, several of the “Group of 23” leaders were present. Sibal spoke to Hindustan Times about the meeting, and what it means.What was objective of the dinner you hosted for Opposition leaders?It is to get everyone together and to start a conversation. All political parties were of the Opposition, and we wanted to see how we could go forward together; that’s it.It came very soon after Rahul Gandhi hosted a breakfast meeting of the Opposition. Did you have that in mind, as yours came so soon after it?This is a typical journalist question. We don’t measure our moves by finding out who has what meeting and where, this is not how it is. It so happened that I decided to have a dinner, and I wanted to call my friends and this has nothing to do with anybody else.A lot of the people who attended, spoke about 2024 elections. What do you think came out of it?If you start a conversation, it’s not a dialogue that can be completed in one go. The conversation will continue.One of the persons who attended your dinner was Sharad Pawar. He’s also had meetings with Prashant Kishor, which revolved around 2024. Is this in any way related to those conversations?What do the two have to do with each other? That was a one-to-one meeting, and this was a conversation with all the political parties who are not with the BJP -- one of them (BJD) is equidistant to both the BJP and the Congress, and others are in Opposition.You managed to get BJD and YSR both at your dinner, and both are not associated with any Opposition activity.I’ve had personal relations with Rajasekhara Reddy (chief minister Jagan Reddy’s father). He is a dear friend, I did so many battles for him. I have close relations with everybody. They were very kind to come, and I was touched that they came. I have very close relations with the BJD also. Pinaki Misra (BJD MP) was my chamber junior. This is a conversation because we feel that the BJP is destroying the foundations of our republic; they have belittled every institution in this country; they are using the investigating agencies to target people; the way they are filling up governor and vice-chancellor slots. I think all parties are now beginning to feel that we must come together and save India. That really was the purpose of this conversation.I believe that Omar Abdullah said that a strong Congress makes for a strong Opposition. Do you think your party is strong at the moment?Obviously we are not as strong as we should be, we should become stronger. We hope that in the next election we are sufficiently strong to prove that what Omar Abdullah said is right. I think he made a very strong point and all of us who are Congressmen are wanting the Congress to be stronger as we go forward and put up a good show in 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-parties-must-come-together-and-save-india-sibal-101628620287107.html
11-08-2021||India||House decends into chaos over farm laws||The Rajya Sabha was supposed to see a debate on agriculture, the problems that ailed it, and solutions -- the closest the government has come to giving in to the Opposition’s demand for a discussion on the three contentious farm reform laws passed last year and the ensuing and still ongoing farmers’ protest -- but what it ended up seeing for four hours on Tuesday was tumult and chaos.At least two Opposition MPs, including Aam Admi Party’s (AAP) Sanjay Singh, sat on the table usually occupied by the staff of the Rajya Sabha secretariat (though they prefer chairs) and shouted slogans. The Congress’s Pratap Singh Bajwa, stood atop the table and tossed the House rulebook to the Chair . And Opposition MPs swarmed the Well of the House. Two Opposition leaders later conceded that the “protests” were part of their plan; they were miffed that the debate was held on the generic topic of problems of agriculture, and not on the farm laws. Trinamool Congress’s Derek O’Brien, however, claimed that all opposition parties will “fully support” the upcoming Constitution amendment bill that restores the rights of states to identify and define socially and economically backward classes. A senior governmentfunctionary suggested that the government might not seek disciplinary action against opposition MPs . “It’s like a new normal! The government bills are passed even as the Opposition disrupts the House. Immediate action against some MPs may be avoided as the government needs the Opposition’s support to pass the Constitution amendment bill.” The Rajya Sabha earlier suspended Trinamool’s Santanu Sen for snatching papers from Union IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw. Another six Trinamool MPs were suspended for a day for showing placards in the Well. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said: “Today, it is proven there is nothing wrong in the farm laws, it is in their (Opposition’s) perception.” He added that the Opposition is “unable to digest” PM Narendra Modi’s “measures and schemes have led to sectoral growth and prosperity in the lives of farmers”. Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu appealed for peace in the morning of what was the sixteenth sitting of the Monsoon Session pointing out that the Upper House had functioned at the rate of just one hour per day. “Farmers’ issue, which is a larger issue, is scheduled for discussion today. If the House is not allowed to function today, a message will also go that this House is not concerned about the plight of the farmers,” he said. But the Opposition was having none of it. The disruptions started in a few hours when Congress chief whip Jairam Ramesh, who last week had given notice to debate farm laws, alleged that the subject of the debate was changed. “I had given notice for a Calling Attention Motion on the three black farm laws and the ongoing farmers’ agitation for the last nine to 10 months. Today I find that my name is shown against Short Duration Discussion on a general topic of ‘Agricultural Problems and Solutions’,” he said, arguing that sense of the House is required to change the nature of the debate. Lawmakers from several Opposition parties stormed the well of the House shouting slogans against the government and demanding a repeal of the farm laws. The debate lasted for only a few more minutes. Bharatiya Janata Party’s Vijaypal Singh Tomar blamed the wrong policies of the Congress for the problems of the farmers. Biju Janata Dal’s Prasanna Acharya argued that the NSSO has not made any study on farmer’s income in last few years and yet “the government claims that they have been able to double the income of the farmers”. “It is a misnomer. It is not the fact,” he said, “If you adjust the increase against inflation, the farm income remains static.” The Upper House functioned for just 24 minutes on Tuesday.A person aware of the developments said Parliament could be adjourned sine die after passing the Constitution amendment bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-nod-a-must-to-withdraw-cases-against-politicians-sc-101628620163149.html
11-08-2021||India||Leave Afghanistan, India tells its citizens||India on Tuesday advised its nationals in Afghanistan to make immediate arrangements to return home, even as it began the process of evacuating its officials and citizens from the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif following advances made by Taliban fighters.A security advisory issued by the Indian embassy in Kabul called on Indians to make travel arrangements before commercial air services are discontinued, and asked Indian firms operating in Afghanistan to immediately withdraw Indian employees from project sites before air services get affected.All India-based officials and security personnel from the Indian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif and a small number of Indian nationals living in and around Afghanistan’s fourth-largest city were to be evacuated in a special flight late on Tuesday, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.The exact number of people being brought back to India couldn’t be ascertained. The move came exactly a month after India evacuated some 50 officials and security personnel from the consulate in the southern city of Kandahar on July 10 following intense clashes between Afghan forces and Taliban fighters in the area.The Indian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif, which was the only fully functional consulate out of four such missions across Afghanistan, asked Indian nationals to take the evacuation flight.“A special flight is leaving from Mazar-e-Sharif to New Delhi. Any Indian nationals in and around Mazar-e-Sharif are requested to leave for India in the special flight scheduled to depart late today evening,” the consulate tweeted. It asked Indian citizens wishing to take the flight to provide their names and passport numbers.There was no official word on the development from the external affairs ministry.Fears of a Taliban assault on Mazar-e-Sharif, the capital of Balkh province, have grown since the group took over the northern cities of Kunduz and Aibak. However, hours after the Indian consulate posted its tweet, the Afghan media quoted Balkh governor Mohammad Farhad Azimi as saying the Afghan troops had pushed back a Taliban offensive on Mazar-e-Sharif.Azimi said the Taliban retreated after facing strong resistance from Afghan forces during clashes on Monday night. “The Taliban have focused their attention on Balkh province to take control,” Azimi told Tolo News.The people cited above said the strength of the Indian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif was reduced recently because of the Taliban intensifying its campaign to overrun provincial capitals and urban centres. The consulate has been without a head since the last consul general, Vinesh Kalra, died of Covid-19 in Kabul in May.Tuesday’s security advisory from the Indian embassy in Kabul was the third such alert issued since June 29 and reiterated a warning to avoid non-essential travel because of a serious threat of kidnapping. It added commercial air travel services to many provinces and cities were being discontinued with the escalation of violence.“All Indian nationals visiting, staying and working in Afghanistan are strongly advised to keep themselves updated on the availability of commercial flights from various parts of Afghanistan and make immediate travel arrangements to return to India before commercial air services are discontinued to their place of stay/visit in Afghanistan,” the alert said.“Indian companies operating in Afghanistan are strongly advised to immediately withdraw their Indian employees out of project sites in Afghanistan before air travel services get discontinued. Indian nationals working for Afghan or foreign companies in Afghanistan should immediately request their employer to facilitate their travel from project sites to India,” it added.The embassy said the advisory was also valid for Indian media personnel, who should contact the mission’s public affairs and security wing for a personalised briefing, “including specific advice for the location they are travelling to”. This, it added, will help the media make a better assessment of “risks involved, given the rapid changes in security situation taking place in different parts of the country”.According to information provided by the government to Parliament last week, there are currently some 1,500 Indian nationals in Afghanistan. Most of them are workers and professionals engaged for the hundreds of development projects being implemented by the Indian government under its pledges of $3 billion for reconstruction and development efforts.The last security advisory issued on July 24 had said the security situation “remains dangerous in several provinces”. It said terror groups had escalated violent activities including targeting of civilians. “Indian nationals are not exceptions, and they additionally face a serious threat of kidnapping,” it added.Since the previous advisory was issued, the security situation has further deteriorated as the Taliban have pushed ahead with their campaign targeting provincial capitals and urban centres after capturing wide swathes of territory in rural areas. With the drawdown of US and NATO troops set to be completed by August 31, experts believe the security situation will worsen.In April last year, India shut its consulates in Herat and Jalalabad, ostensibly because of the spread of Covid-19, though some reports suggested security was a factor in the decision.Indian officials have said the situation in Afghanistan is being closely monitored to ensure the security of all Indians. Worries about the safety of Indian nationals have grown since Reuters journalist Danish Siddiqui was killed by the Taliban in the border town of Spin Boldak while on an assignment embedded with Afghan forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leave-afghanistan-india-tells-its-citizens-101628620103248.html
11-08-2021||India||At least 1,000 vehicles entered Mizoram from Assam since blockade lifted||More than 1,000 vehicles have entered Mizoram ever since the informal economic blockade along the border with Assam by a few Assamese groups was called off on Saturday, Mizoram Police said on Tuesday. Around 300 vehicles have safely moved towards Assam till Tuesday afternoon, they added. “The situation has normalised and no vehicles were stopped by locals on either side...But we are keeping a strict vigil in the area,” Cachar district superintendent of police Ramandeep Kaur said. As many as 1,037 vehicles have entered Mizoram from Assam between Saturday night and Tuesday afternoon, police said. This includes 381 heavy and 281 medium weight vehicles carrying essential goods, 285 light vehicles carrying passengers, 30 LPG tankers and 45 oil tankers. From the Mizoram side, 294 vehicles entered Assam through the Lailapur border till 12pm on Tuesday. This includes 83 heavy vehicles, 67 medium weight vehicles carrying essential goods, 123 light vehicles and 19 oil tankers.Superintendent of police of Kolasib district in Mizoram, Vanlalfaka Ralte, said, “We are supervising each movement along the border. The challenge is to maintain the situation so that drivers and passengers do not hesitate to move.”An informal economic blockade was observed by the Assamese groups in Lailapur after a fierce gunbattle at a disputed border left six policemen dead and 41 others injured on July 26. Assam claimed Mizoram police opened fire on its forces who objected to a road being constructed by Mizoram on a patch of forested land it claims. Mizoram claimed the land belongs to it. The clashes led some residents on the Assam side to block some sections of National Highway 306, disrupting transportation to the neighbouring state.At a meeting called by Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla on July 29, the two sides agreed to withdraw their police forces in the four-km disputed stretch which runs between Vairengte in Mizoram and Lailapur in Assam along NH-306. They also agreed to the deployment of central paramilitary troops in the area till a permanent solution is found.On Saturday, guardian minister of Cachar district Ashok Singhal and minister of excise, forest & environment and fisheries, Parimal Suklabaidya, visited Lailapur border to lift the blockade. After a two-hour meeting, locals in Assam allowed the movement of vehicles but threatened to resume the blockade if no action was taken against Mizoram police officials who were involved in the July 26 firing. They also asked that the IR battalion of Mizoram be moved from the disputed areas, leaving it to neutral forces.“We have lost our police officials and some part of Assam’s land. We cannot tell them (the Centre) what to do but if justice is not served, our protest will resume. Our brothers have sacrificed their lives to save the land and we just can’t let it go so easily,” one of the locals told HT on condition of anonymity.Forest minister Parimal Suklabaidya and Member of Parliament from Silchar, Rajdeep Roy, supported the demands of the Lailapur locals. While Suklabaidya told HT he will move the Supreme Court, Roy said he will talk to Union home minister Amit Shah to seek action against the Mizoram police personnel.Executive magistrate of Mizoram’s Kolasib district, Carolyne Pachuau, said, “Now that the blockade has been withdrawn, the Mizoram government has exempted truck drivers from mandatory Covid test in order to encourage them. We discussed this with the local people and they have agreed not to create any such situation that hampers the peace process.”“Barak Valley of Assam always threatens Mizoram with economic blockade which only causes suffering to the common people...In that sense, this is a wake-up call and Mizoram has started thinking of alternatives in such situations,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-least-1-000-vehicles-entered-mizoram-from-assam-since-blockade-lifted-101628593761624.html
11-08-2021||India||Two from outside bought property in J&K since 2019: Centre tells LS||The Centre on Tuesday told Parliament that two people from outside Jammu and Kashmir have bought property in the region since August 2019, when laws that prohibited non-locals from doing so were controversially scrapped by the Union government.The statement, made by minister of state for home Nityanand Rai in the Lok Sabha, stirred a political row in Kashmir, where many mainstream parties remain opposed to the revocation of the region’s special status and statehood.“As per the information provided by the government of Jammu and Kashmir, two persons from outside J&K (Jammu and Kashmir) have purchased two properties in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir since August 2019,” Rai said in a written reply.Asked about any hardship and impediments being faced by the people of other states while buying properties in Jammu and Kashmir, Rai said that no such instance was reported.The minister did not provide any details of the people or the type of properties acquired.Attempts to get details from officials in Jammu and Kashmir did not succeed. Official spokesperson of Jammu and Kashmir government and principal secretary, power and information, Rohit Kansal, did not respond to requests for a comment.On August 5, 2019, the Centre effectively revoked Article 370, which bestowed special status to the erstwhile state, and Article 35A, which barred non-locals from buying or owning immovable property in Jammu and Kashmir, settling there permanently, or availing benefits of state-sponsored scholarship schemes.The constitutional provision gave special rights to Jammu and Kashmir’s permanent residents. Article 370 acknowledged the special status of the (then) state of Jammu and Kashmir in terms of autonomy and its ability to formulate laws for the state’s permanent residents.In October 2020, the Centre Issued a gazette notification omitting the phrase “permanent resident of the state” from Section 17 of the Jammu and Kashmir Development Act that deals with the disposal of land in the union territory.National Conference and Peoples Democratic Party said the government’s statement in Parliament meant that the process of “snatching of rights” had begun.“This is the beginning of coming true of the apprehensions that our land rights will get violated . These were our fears. See when the land rights of other states are being protected and we also had our land rights which were snatched away. It strengthens our apprehensions about land rights,” said Hasnain Masoodi, senior NC leader and member of parliament from south Kashmir.Masoodi said that J&K had a land act before August 5,2019 that would prohibit acquisition of property within J&K by anyone other than a state subject. “That restriction is gone now,” he added.Additional spokesperson of PDP, Tahir Sayed, said that the apprehension of local people were proving correct.“It has just started. It is not only about demographic change. We have very limited resources and we can’t share our limited resources with outsiders. It will just disempower locals economically and politically,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-persons-from-outside-purchased-properties-in-j-k-since-august-2019-mha-101628593101063.html
11-08-2021||India||Tejpal’s acquittal left ‘impression on victims of sexual violence’: Goa govt||Former Tehelka magazine editor Tarun Tejpal’s acquittal in a 2013 rape case has left an “inevitable impression on all victims of sexual violence” and has “a deterrent effect among those who are potential victims”, additional solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the Bombay high court in Goa on Tuesday.Appearing for the state, Mehta opposed the 57-year-old’s plea for an “in-camera” hearing of the Goa government’s petition against his acquittal, saying that “the country has a right to know this institution (the judiciary) has dealt with the girl who came to the court with the complaint, specific allegations, precise facts, and pleading proved with corroborating evidence”.“The way in which our institution has failed...I am using every word not only with sincerity but with a sense of responsibility. Our institution has failed, leaving an inevitable impression upon all victims of sexual violence or sexual assault, that it has a deterrent effect among those who are potential victims,” he said. “They would not come before your lordship or not come before the court of law.”A fast-track court in Goa on May 21 acquitted Tejpal of charges of rape and sexual assault levelled by a former colleague during a conference at a five-star hotel in Goa in 2013. Additional sessions judge Kshama Joshi gave the journalist the benefit of doubt and cleared him of all charges due to lack of evidence.Tejpal’s counsel, Amit Desai, argued that the dignity of the institution should not be assailed at least until the case is finally decided.“I believe in the old school that our institution must be first protected and come to conclusion after hearing whether the institution of the judiciary has failed the citizens of India,” Desai told the court.“Right from day one, every application of this type, including obviously the entire trial in the trial court and the high court, has always been held in camera. I think that is the principle of the law in a matter of this type. Therefore, we have moved an application though the state did not feel the need for it (in camera hearings)...we felt it is an appropriate thing to do in a matter like this, particularly with regards to the sensitivity of the nature of the allegations,” he added.The bench fixed August 31 for the next hearing.Tejpal’s case hit the headlines for weeks amid a renewed focus on crimes against women. It surfaced a year after the rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a moving bus in Delhi provoked national outrage and prompted the government to pass tougher laws to check such crimes. The allegations against Tejpal also triggered a debate on harassment of women at workplaces and underreporting of such cases over fears of job losses and persecution.Tejpal faced the trial under India Penal Code’s Sections 376 (rape), 354 A (sexual harassment), 354 B (criminal assault with intent to disrobe a woman), 341 (wrongful restraint), and 342 (wrongful confinement).Justice Joshi acquitted Tejpal, days after his lawyer Rajeev Gomes, 47, died of Covid on May 12.Tejpal, who has maintained he was falsely accused of sexual assault, referred to an “unfortunate incident” between himself and the colleague in a leaked e-mail to Tehelka’s management in 2013. He described the incident “bad lapse of judgment” in the e-mail. In another note, later, however, he said that he was being “framed”.The Goa government called the verdict as “perverse” and “influenced by extraneous inadmissible materials and testimonies”, and filed an appeal before the Bombay high court on May 25.The Goa Police said the judgement “was shocking in its apparent legal bias against the prosecutrix (survivor)” and was “unsustainable in law and is coloured by prejudice and patriarchy”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tejpals-acquittal-left-impression-on-victims-of-sexual-violence-goa-govt-101628592321175.html
11-08-2021||India||Rahul calls for restoration of J&K statehood||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday accused the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre of launching an assault on every institution in the country, saying that the Opposition wasn’t being allowed to raise important issues such as the farm bills, snooping, unemployment and corruption in Parliament.The former Congress chief also called for restoration of statehood to Jammu & Kashmir, and the conduct of free and fair elections in the Union territory without any delay.Addressing party workers after inaugurating a party unit at M A road, Gandhi said: “We are not allowed to speak in Parliament on issues like farm bills, Pegasus (snooping controversy), corruption, Rafale (deal) and unemployment. Whether it’s the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, judiciary or other institutions of the country, they are facing an onslaught. Even people from the press can’t write or speak. They are afraid that if they write they will lose their jobs.”“There is not only an attack on Jammu & Kashmir, but there is also an indirect attack in the rest of the country on all institutions,” he added.BJP state spokesperson Altaf Thakur refuted the allegations, saying that Parliament members were always allowed to speak in both the Houses.“Unfortunately, Rahul Gandhi doesn’t want to speak in Parliament or his party has asked him not to speak there, so it’s not the BJP’s fault.”Besides this, Gandhi, who arrived in Srinagar on Monday for a two-day visit — his first since the revocation of Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir — said that he feels like he is “coming home” each time he visits the Union territory.“I can well understand the psyche of people of Kashmir and have inherited Kashmiriyat. With love, you can get every work done from the people of Kashmir and by force or hatred nothing can be achieved from the people,” he said.The Congress leader said that he will continue to fight against the divisive ideology of the Prime Minister. “I fight against Narendra Modi and we will continue to fight against his divisive ideology, the ideology that divides India,” he said.Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, who also arrived in Srinagar earlier in the day, batted for land and job rights for its residents, saying if laws providing such benefits were valid in other areas like Himachal Pradesh, why snatch them away from the erstwhile state.“The (assembly) elections...should be conducted soon. But before the elections, the statehood should be restored, which is very important. Kashmiri Pandits should be brought back,” he said.“Our land and job (rights), which were taken away after Article 370 was revoked, should be secured like they were before (August 5, 2019) through a new law when the statehood is restored,” he added.The former leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha urged Gandhi to raise the issue of Jammu & Kashmir in Parliament so that a bill that restores the statehood and protects land and job rights of locals is passed in Parliament within the remaining three days of the ongoing session. He said that J-K cannot be a state like Delhi where every order has to be approved by the Lieutenant Governor.“J-K is a border state and the L-G cannot govern it. We don’t want a Delhi like state where L-G has to approve every order,” he said.On August 5, 2019, the Centre had revoked Article 370 of the Constitution that gave Jammu & Kashmir a special status and bifurcated the state into two Union territories.As a pre-emptive measure, Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was imposed in the state and prominent state political leaders such as former chief ministers Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti were placed under house arrest. Communication lines, too, were snapped while internet and mobile services were suspended.Days after the Centre’s move, Gandhi had led an opposition delegation to Kashmir, but was forced to go back from the Srinagar airport.On July 28, minister of state for home affairs Nityanand Rai told Rajya Sabha that the statehood for Jammu & Kashmir would be granted after “normalcy is restored”.In an interview with Hindustan Times on July 28, Jammu & Kashmir lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha said that Union home minister Amit Shah had assured that “statehood would be granted to the union territory at an appropriate time”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/every-institution-in-the-country-under-attack-rahul-gandhi-101628591001781.html
11-08-2021||India||States cannot withdraw cases against MPs, MLAs without HC nod: SC||The Supreme Court on Tuesday issued directions that no criminal case against MPs or MLAs can be withdrawn without an approval of the high court of the concerned state, in a move that significantly clips the powers of the state governments at a time when the top court has expressed grave concern over the criminalisation of politics.A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, said that the direction has to be issued urgently in view of a report by the amicus curiae (lawyer to assist the court) depicting several instances where state governments sought to drop charges against sitting and former legislators. “We deem it appropriate to direct that no prosecution against a sitting or former MPs or MLAs shall be withdrawn without the leave of the high court,” ordered the bench, which also included justices Vineet Saran and Surya Kant, in a virtual clampdown on misuse of power by the state governments under Section 321 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) that authorises a prosecutor to seek withdrawal of a criminal case against the accused. On the same day, another bench, comprising justices Rohinton F Nariman and BR Gavai, warned that the nation is “losing its patience” in waiting for lawmakers to cleanse politics by making stronger laws to keep out those with criminal antecedents. Imposing monetary penalty on all major political parties for flouting its directives on disclosure of information about criminal background of their candidates during the 2020 Bihar assembly polls, this bench, in a separate judgment, exhorted lawmakers to “wake up from their deep slumber” to weed out the malignancy of criminalisation in politics. Meanwhile, the CJI-led bench cited its earlier order on September 16, 2020, by which the high courts were asked to register suo motu (on its own motion) writ petitions to monitor trials against MPs and MLAs, and asked them to examine the cases of withdrawals, whether pending or disposed of, since September 16, 2020. Referring to a July 28-judgment by the top court in which the Kerala government’s move to withdraw cases against some of state’s sitting and former MLAs was snubbed, the bench emphasised: “The power under Section 321, CrPC, is a responsibility which is to be utilised in public interest, and cannot be used for extraneous and political considerations. This power is required to be utilised with utmost good faith to serve the larger public interest.”The court further directed that all trial judges hearing the criminal cases against MPs and MLAs in special courts shall continue in their present posts till its further orders. To this end, the registrar general of all 25 high courts were asked to submit details of judges hearing such cases in the special courts, status of pendency, judgments delivered, and other details. The directions were issued while hearing a plea filed by advocate Ashwini Upadhyaya, who cited staggering pendency of criminal cases against MPs and MLAs and sought their expeditious disposal by setting up special courts. Amicus curiae senior advocate Vijay Hansaria, assisted by advocate Sneha Kalita, implored the bench that no prosecution should be allowed to be withdrawn under Section 321, CrPC, against a sitting or former member of Parliament or a member of legislative assembly/council without the permission of the high court. Hansaria listed out instances from Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Maharashtra where orders under Section 321 CrPC were issued. In Karnataka, a government order sought to withdraw 61 criminal cases, many of which were filed against sitting MLAs of the state. Uttar Pradesh similarly chose to withdraw prosecution last year against political leader Sadhvi Prachi and three sitting MLAs – Sangeet Som, Suresh Rana and Kapil Dev -- for making inflammatory statements during the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots. The amicus cited news reports to state that withdrawal of prosecution was applicable to 76 criminal cases related to the riots. Another report from Maharashtra indicated that the state government decided in December last year to withdraw political cases against activists registered prior to December 31, 2019. In June, the Andhra Pradesh high court took suo motu cognisance of 11 separate orders passed by various magistrates allowing withdrawal of prosecution in criminal cases pending against chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy. This case, however, was not cited by the amicus in his report. According to an analysis of candidate affidavits by the not-for-profit Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), the share of MPs with declared criminal cases against them has been increasing in the last decade. It stood at 30% in 2009 and 43% in 2019. In 2019, 39% of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s winning candidates had a criminal case against them; this number was 57% for the Congress, 43% for the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and 41% for the Trinamool Congress. Hansaria relied on the July 28 judgment that legislators do not have immunity from criminal law while clearing the decks for the prosecution of some of Kerala’s sitting and former MLAs who threw furniture and destroyed computers and microphones during a House proceeding in 2015. During the proceedings, the court also pulled up the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for not submitting details of cases the agency is prosecuting against MPs and MLAs. The bench read out its orders since September 2020 when the CBI was repeatedly asked to submit a status report but to no avail. “We have no words now. We have already said everything we could. We have to only presume certain things now... We asked the government of India about their seriousness and we were told that the government is very much serious about completion of trials against MPs and MLAs but there is nothing you have done. We can say this much,” it told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for CBI. “There is no progress there (in trial courts) and no progress here. If there is even a reluctance in filing the status reports, what more to say,” rued the bench. On his part, the S-G said that the government was committed to expeditious completion of trials against the elected representatives and asked for a final opportunity to file the report. “We are giving you the last opportunity. If you don’t do it now, we will assume you have nothing to say,” retorted the bench as it fixed August 25 as the next date of hearing. The CJI also indicated that a special bench will be constituted to regularly monitor the progress made in ensuring speedy trials of MPs and MLAs, in which there is already a direction of the top court in 2014 that such trials must complete within one year of the framing of charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-cannot-withdraw-cases-against-mps-mlas-without-hcnodsc-101628582060399.html
11-08-2021||India||Avoid ‘parallel debate’ on Pegasus issue: Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Tuesday took exception to a “parallel debate” by petitioners outside the courts on the alleged surveillance of Indian citizens with the Israeli Pegasus spyware, saying if they are using the legal system they must have faith in it.Even as the Union government received time till Monday to respond to a clutch of petitions demanding a court-monitored independent investigation into the alleged snooping, the top court asked petitioners to refrain from debating the issue on public platforms while it was adjudicating the matter.“Any of the petitioners who is interested in this matter and is saying things in the newspapers, we expect they will answer our queries through a proper channel in the court hall and not outside. We expect petitioners to understand there will be a debate in the court. Questions will be asked. They must have faith in the system. But this parallel debate, parallel discussion..” the bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana told the counsel for the petitioners.“There must be some discipline. We asked some questions. There is an adjudication process. Sometimes it may be inconvenient to you and sometimes convenient but that is how this process is. Both sides have to face the music. If they want to bring something to our notice, they should file those documents here,” added the bench, which also comprised justices Vineet Saran and Surya Kant.CJI Ramana said that it was a message from all the three judges on the bench to the petitioners, which included advocate ML Sharma; former union minister Yashwant Sinha, Rajya Sabha MP John Brittas; the Editors Guild of India (EGI); journalists N Ram and Sashi Kumar; journalists Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, Rupesh Kumar Singh, Ipshita Shatakshi, SNM Abdi, and Prem Shankar Jha; and civil rights activists Jagdeep S Chhokar and Narendra Mishra.At this point, senior advocate Kapil Sibal said: “When I was appearing for Mr N Ram last time, the court had asked me why Indians were not there in the order of the California court although the petition mentioned it. He was severely trolled for it.”The CJI replied: “This is the problem of taking one line out of context. But debates must not cross the limit. If they are using the system, they should have faith in the system. This is the message from all of us.”Sibal agreed that petitioners should not make any kind of public statements when their petitions were being heard by the bench.Meanwhile, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, said that he will need some time to get instructions on the matter from the government. “I have received most of the petitions. Let me get instructions from the government and come back,” he submitted.The court accepted this request and fixed the matter for Monday next. “We will take a call (on issuance of notice) on Monday,” remarked the CJI. Lawyers for the petitioners also got the liberty to file additional documents in the case.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, representing former RSS ideologue and political activist KN Govindacharya, informed the bench that Govindacharya has also moved court. Singh pointed out that Govindacharya came to the court in 2019 for an investigation into the alleged surveillance by Pegasus but his plea was not entertained. “My client went to the parliamentary committee after that but nothing has happened,” added the lawyer. The court agreed to hear Govindacharya’s petition along with the other pleas on Monday.Last week, the bench agreed to seek a response from the Union government as it asked the petitioners to serve copies of their pleadings on the union government to ensure that a law officer remains present in the court on the day.During the hour-long proceedings on August 5, the bench said the allegations were serious in nature if the reports are correct and posed three questions to the petitioners.The first was why they came to the court after a gap of almost two years since the first reports on the use of Pegasus spyware were out way back in May 2019. This is a reference to WhatsApp revealing then that NSO’s software was used to send malware to more than 1,400 phones.The second question was on whether any of the petitioners lodged a first information report or a criminal complaint against alleged illegal interception of their phones.The third related to the existence of any empirical evidence to corroborate the claims of the infractions.The Pegasus row erupted on July 18 after an international investigative consortium reported that the phones of many Indian ministers, politicians, activists, businessmen and journalists were among the 50,000 that were potentially targeted by Pegasus, Israeli company NSO Group’s phone hacking software. According to this consortium -- which included Washington Post, The Guardian, La Monde, and India’s The Wire, among other publications -- Pegasus can switch on a target’s phone camera and microphone, as well as access data on the device, effectively turning a phone into a pocket spy.The list database was first obtained by France-based non-profit Forbidden Stories, which shared the information with the reporting partners. The devices of at least 67 of the numbers were analysed by Amnesty International and of these, 37 had signs of being hacked by Pegasus. Of these 37, 10 were in India.NSO says its software is sold only to government customers after vetting by Israeli authorities. The Indian government has neither confirmed nor denied that it procured or used Pegasus, and has repeatedly ruled out any illegal surveillance in India.On Monday, the Union defence ministry replied on the floor of the parliament that it has not had any transaction with the Israeli-based firm.To be sure, as the methodology of the investigation into the alleged snooping explains, the presence of a number on the database of the alleged targeted numbers does not indicate an individual’s phone was hacked — just that it was of interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pegasus-row-have-faith-in-the-system-says-sc-to-petitioners-101628580200660.html

11-08-2021||Today's||Retrospective tax: A policy based on delusion gets buried||I remember choking on my morning coffee on reading a news report which said that India’s finance minister (FM) had made a statement in Parliament that Indians won’t have to eat lizards if foreign direct investment (FDI) flows are affected.It was 2012, and Pranab Mukherjee was responding to a question about whether he expected the amendment in tax laws, popularly known as the retrospective tax amendment, to affect foreign investment. A pragmatic man on most occasions, his display of irritation at the thought that India’s tax policy changes would be unpalatable to foreign investors was palpable.Tax policy has always been regarded as the sovereign right of each nation State; so why would the global investment community have a problem? Well, because just as in the case of any other investment, capital moves to economies which give investors a sense of security. And one of the foremost factors to induce such security is the transparency and stability of tax policies. Even if tax rates are high, investors will still move capital to nations as long as they know what to expect since the tax rates can be factored into their business plans. The converse, however, is repulsive — unpredictable and non-transparent rates muddied with ifs and buts, even if low, drive away capital.The administration of the day, however, had a single-minded focus on raising revenue, coupled with the belief that it had the sovereign right to do so. This was a shortsighted approach, unmindful of the impact of the move on the overall investment rating of the country, as demonstrated by the FM’s indignant attitude to the question.Also Read | Climate crisis: No one will be sparedThe saga of the retrospective tax started when the holding company of Essar Telecom was acquired by Vodafone. Extant tax laws required Vodafone to withhold tax on the transaction and deposit the amount with the revenue authorities, except for one crucial fact — the obligation to withhold tax did not arise on transactions between two non-resident entities. The holding entity being acquired was not domiciled in India i.e. it was a non-resident entity for tax purposes, and Vodafone did not withhold tax on the deal value.The revenue authorities believed that since the holding entity was a shell company, its value was in the underlying Indian entity and, therefore, tax ought to have been deducted and deposited. Consequently, Vodafone was slapped with a huge tax demand, including the amount of tax which the authorities believed that Vodafone ought to have withheld.The dispute reached the Supreme Court (SC), which looked closely at the issue and ruled that there was nothing whatsoever on the statute books which required Vodafone to withhold tax on the offshore transaction. The Union government, therefore, chose to amend the law to provide that even transactions with no connection with India would give rise to the obligation to withhold tax if, as a result of such an offshore transaction, an undertaking or asset in India was acquired.Consequently, SC’s decision, which was the strictly correct legal interpretation, was effectively reversed. Moreover, the reversal became applicable with retrospective effect. This ensured that Vodafone, which had already completed the deal, did not get away with what some mandarins in the corridors of power believed was “being cute”.Also Read | Pegasus: India needs urgent surveillance reformThe amendment also impacted other transactions which were structured relying on the same provisions of law upheld by the apex court, no less. Since the liability of the payer can extend to bearing the tax not withheld, interest and penalty, the amounts in question were significant. Tax officers, who often have to meet collection targets no matter what, started to raise huge tax demands.The government’s move was seen by the global investment community as a violation of the unwritten rule of transparency and stability in fiscal policy. Vodafone had genuine reasons to believe that Indian law did not seek to tax such transactions — a view upheld by SC. But it discovered much later that the government would reverse its own tax law and policy to rub your nose in the ground, and make you cough up the money it believed it is owed. Taxpayers may be held liable for tax arising on historic transactions, even though they had no inkling of the liability.Unfortunately, the mandarins in the corridors of power had forgotten that India had inked several investment treaties under which the actions of investee States considered to be expropriation, are subject to claims for compensation. Vodafone, and others similarly affected, sought recourse to arbitration proceedings under the treaty provisions. And so it was that international treaty arbitrations held that a retrospective amendment in the law is expropriatory in nature.When one is starved of capital and technology, you do not ride the high horse and take the position that they need us more than we need them. This is a delusional view which had percolated down into the administration, based on a belief in the success story of the Indian middle class. The chickens were bound to come home to roost. Once having strenuously, but unsuccessfully, argued that tax policy being a sovereign issue is not the subject matter of investment treaties, the government has now finally decided to cut its losses and cancel the demands.Percival Billimoria is a senior advocateThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/retrospective-tax-a-policy-based-on-delusion-gets-buried-101628672549940.html
11-08-2021||Today's||Climate crisis: No one will be spared||Some recent news and headlines: Extreme flooding in Maharashtra and Himachal Pradesh in India, and Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. Hundreds dead in floods in Henan (China). Heat wave in British Columbia (Canada) kills dozens. How do we make sense of all this?Climate scientists are wary of overstating risks, what is known as type 1 errors (false positives). But there is a real danger of type 2 errors (false negatives). As climate risks rise, type 2 errors can give policymakers a false sense of comfort that things are not so bad. After all, climate models have actually underestimated the scale of impact even at relatively lower levels of warming. Warm weather that could result in Arctic permafrost thawing is happening 70 years ahead of climate model projections.This week, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released the report of its Working Group I (on the physical science of the climate crisis), laying many doubts to rest. Global surface temperatures are 1.09°C higher in 2011-2020 than in 1850-1900. The world will breach 1.5°C of warming within the next two decades with extreme events rapidly rising.Also Read | Pegasus: India needs urgent surveillance reformWeather attribution studies investigate whether specific extreme weather events are merely freak deviations from the normal range or whether they are made more likely (and worse) due to human-induced climate crisis. Take Verkhoyansk in eastern Siberia, known as the Pole of Cold for having recorded the lowest temperature north of the Arctic Circle (-67.8°C in 1892). This year, it registered the highest temperature ever within the Arctic Circle of 38°C. Studies now conclude that the severe heat wave in Siberia in 2020 would have been near-impossible without the human-caused climate crisis. The same applies to the heat wave in north-western United States and parts of western Canada this summer.We must, first, understand that extremes today could well become the norm tomorrow. Climate risks are non-linear and the past is not a good predictor of the future. Heavy precipitation events that happened once in 10 years in the pre-industrial era now likely occur 1.3 times each decade (rising to 2.8 times with 4°C of warming). South Asia and several parts of Africa will also face severe droughts with 1.5-2°C of warming.Moreover, our worries do not stop at our borders. It is tempting to dismiss disasters happening elsewhere as not being of immediate concern. But we must spot the warning signs because warming anywhere will impact our future everywhere.In the last 30 years, the Arctic region has warmed at 0.81°C per decade, more than thrice as fast as the global average of 0.23°C per decade. Melting ice is now the most important cause for sea-level rise — and revised estimates predict an over one metre rise in global sea levels by 2100. This is not the Arctic’s problem alone, but will severely impact coastal and low-lying areas all over the world.To compound the problem, blue sea water absorbs more heat than white sea ice. Melting sea ice, therefore, creates a feedback loop: More heat is trapped in sea water, which triggers more thawing. Arctic ice melt has slowed the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, a major ocean current that circulates warm water from the south to the north. The slowing is worse than in 1,600 years, and could disrupt rains from South America to West Africa to India.Also Read | India needs a separate ministry to deal with the climate crisisMelting permafrost is another concern. Arctic permafrost holds nearly twice as much carbon as the atmosphere. On current trends, up to 89% of near-surface permafrost could disappear by 2100. This would release tens to hundreds of billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide and methane, adding to warming.In the Northern Hemisphere, reduced temperature differences between the Equator and the Pole results in a southern oscillation of the Jet Stream (and as it meanders, it sometimes stalls). This creates more weather extremes, increasing droughts and floods in locations further south. Arctic heating and changing weather patterns could impact the severity of heat waves in South Asia.It would be foolhardy to dismiss these concerns as that of environmentalists alone. There are serious economic ramifications for India where nearly 75% of the labour force (380 million people) is exposed to heat stress. In 2030, India could lose 5.8% of working hours (a productivity loss equivalent to 34 million full-time jobs), according to the International Labour Organization. CEEW analysts find that there has been a six-fold increase in extreme flood events in Maharashtra since 1970. As India’s economic powerhouse, such vulnerability majorly threatens physical assets and financial investments.The climate system is under unprecedented stress in human history. Rich people think they can escape. Poor people hope they can adapt. But the climate crisis will lead to untold misery, hundreds of billions of dollars of losses in infrastructure, widening inequalities and social instability. Regardless of where the extreme events occur, we will all be impacted adversely.In a year filled with tragedy due to the pandemic, it might be too much to expect that people will care about weather extremes near the Poles. But the biggest lesson for us is that the distant is here and the future is now; the time to act was yesterday.Arunabha Ghosh is CEO, Council on Energy, Environment and Water and a member of the Climate Crisis Advisory Group, an independent international scientific bodyThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/climate-crisis-no-one-will-be-spared-101628668229325.html
