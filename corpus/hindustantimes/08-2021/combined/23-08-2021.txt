Earlier, on August 9, the court asked the police to file a status report on its investigation with regard to the 35 leaders named in the FIR related to the case.Senior advocate Ramesh Gupta, appearing for Sidhana, told the court that the FIR was registered after 12 hours of the incident, and include the names of 35 leaders but despite the lapse of eight months, none of them have been arrested or asked to join the investigation.Additional Public Prosecutor G S Guarya, appearing for the police, admitted that the report filed was cryptic and does not address the issues raised by the court.The court said the report filed by the police was an attempt to sidetrack the issue, and noted that the investigating officer’s “main evidence” against Sidhana was also not up to the mark.It said that there was no audio and it cannot be heard what Sidhana was saying to the other protesters. The court directed that the proper video of the alleged instigating speech given by Sidhana should be submitted. The matter will be heard on August 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/probe-in-farmers-protest-case-going-on-as-per-convenience-instead-of-law-says-delhi-court-101629743126272.html

One person had surrendered before a court while search for the remaining six was on. The fraud came to light when the bank officials get examined the mortgaged fake gold by an independent jeweller other than the authorised gold appraiser of the bank, they said. “Three cases were registered against 17 people, including Ravindra Prakash Seth, Prateek Rastogi, Vijay Prajapati, Amit Kumar Sharma and others under sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document), 409 (criminal breach of trust) and 120 B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at two different police stations including Cantt and two at Maduadih police station, following three complaints lodged by officials of the three branches of the bank in this regard,” said a senior police officer. The officer said that one case was registered against 11 people in the first week of August, following a complaint by manager of the Cantt bank branch, Rampal Singh while two cases were registered against six people at Manduadih on August 17, following two different complaints lodged by the managers of two different branches in Lahartara area. An investigation started in the three cases and teams were deployed at different locations to ensure the arrest of the accused, the officer said. “On Sunday, 10 accused including Shivnarayan Yadav, Amit Kumar Sharma, Suraj Bind, Prateek Rastogi, Sagar Kumar Maurya, Rajesh Kumar Mehta, Laxman Singh, Neha Srivastava, Shweta Zaberi and Deepa Prajapati were arrested from different locations in the city,” said additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP), Prabal Pratap Singh. The officer said that during interrogation, Prateek Rastogi revealed that he knew Ravindra Prakash Seth, an authorised gold appraiser of the two branches of Canara Bank, for long time. He befriended Seth and Vijay Prajapati and hatched a plan to make money. “Under the plan, Prateek and Vijay, claimed to be the agents of the bank, motivated some people to take loan in lieu of fake gold from two branches of Canara Bank in Lahartara and one branch in Orderly Bazaar,” the officer said.The gold, which they had to deposit in the branches, were provided to them by Ravindra Prakash Seth. In lieu, each person, who took the loan on fake gold, were given ₹10,000 to ₹15,000 as commission. Prateek, Ravindra and Vijay distributed the remaining amount equally among them as their share, the officer said. According to a bank official, the gold deposited by the customers for the loan is first examined by an authorised gold appraiser of the bank and after three months, the gold is again get examined by a Sarraf or jeweller.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/17-mortgage-fake-gold-get-loans-worth-rs-85-lakh-in-varanasi-10-arrested-101629743019057.html

Malini Narayanan, chairperson of the National Progressive Schools’ Conference, which has 122 Delhi schools as members, said, “We held a meeting recently to check the attendance rate across schools. In Delhi, we have noted varying attendance, from 50%-90%. Currently, we are looking at them as Class 11 students and introducing them to various lab apparatus. We are teaching them to handle the burette and pipette because they have been doing their practicals only on simulation labs. Once the government gives the go-ahead, we can start theory lessons as well.”Narayanan also said a few parents are still sceptical of sending children to school in the absence of school buses and other factors. “Some of our students are currently in other cities. We have been writing to parents and asking them to return so that children may get some practical experience. The lack of vaccines for children has been a major deterrent in convincing them,” she said.Several private schools in the city, including Ahlcon International School, Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, Laxman Public School, Bal Bharati Public School, Springdales School, Sanskriti School, Delhi Public School, and Amity International School are NPSC member schools. Teachers and principals HT spoke to welcomed the decision to allow students back to school to bridge learning gaps created due to online classes introduced in March last year after schools were shut on account of the pandemic.Schools are also waiting for submissions to be made by a Delhi Disaster Management committee on August 25. The committee, comprising health and education department officials, was tasked with formulating standard operating procedures for reopening of educational institutions and colleges. The Delhi government will take a call on reopening based on the committee recommendations.Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, said, “Learning gap has been a common feedback from teachers who have interacted with the classes 10 and 12 students. While board students are back to school, we are waiting to see when other students will be allowed back to school. The reopening has to be staggered. Allowing all students to return at one go won’t work as we have to see if schools have the infrastructure to accommodate all students while ensuring Covid-19 protocols.” At Arora’s school, around 80% of students were attending the science practicals while about 30% students are attending school in the commerce section.Meanwhile, at government schools, teachers are taking it slow and planning to resume classes as well as practicals beginning September. Awadhesh Kumar Jha, principal of a government school in Rohini, said attendance has picked up in the past one week. “We have been holding orientations and easing students back in to the regular mode, but we plan to start regular lessons only from September. Since we were adapted to online learning for 1.5 years and had not even met students, we have to talk to them about the subject outline, curriculum, and how to study before rushing into practicals,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/parents-wary-few-students-of-classes-10-12-turn-up-for-in-person-classes-in-delhi-schools-101629742707322.html
23-08-2021||Noida||Noida: Man held for stabbing wife’s friend to death at her birthday party||A 30-year-old man was arrested on Monday for allegedly stabbing his wife’s male friend to death at her birthday party in Noida’s Sector 106 three days ago. According to police, suspect Mudit, a resident of Sector 106, had invited the victim, Nishant Choudhary (22), for his wife’s birthday party on Friday night. Nishant was a resident of Delhi’s Sangam Vihar. Police officials said that the two got into an argument over some issue, following which Mudit stabbed Nishant in the neck. He was rushed to a nearby hospital where he succumbed to his injuries, they said. Based on a complaint by his father, Luvkush, a case of murder under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code was registered against Mudit at Phase 2 police station. “My son had gone to Noida for a birthday party where he was assaulted. He later died during treatment. We want appropriate action against the suspect,” said the father in his complaint.The officials said prima facie it seems that the victim was having an affair with the suspect’s wife.“The couple got married two years ago. Mudit’s wife had known Nishant before the marriage. Later Mudit and Nishant also became friends. It seems that Mudit saw Nishant and his wife together during the party following which they got into an argument that ended with Mudit stabbing him in the neck,” said Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, zone 2.After the incident, Mudit fled the spot, police said, adding that he was apprehended on Monday afternoon from near the NSEZ bus stand on the Dadri road. Police have also recovered the weapon used in the crime. Mudit was produced before a magistrate who sent him to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-man-held-for-stabbing-wife-s-friend-to-death-at-her-birthday-party-101629742706268.html

On Monday, Covaxin was available in 29 of the 39 CVCs. Officials said they had only 2,500 Covishield doses on the day.The Co-Win portal on recorded 11,183 doses administered in the district till 7pm on Monday, taking its overall count to over 1.8 million doses.With supply bottlenecks, Covaxin is is the least administered in Uttar Pradesh. Co-Win data showed that Covishield formed about 87% of the total doses administered, while the rest was of Covaxin. The share of the vaccines was similar in Ghaziabad too.Till Sunday, the district had Covaxin at only a centre in Dasna, Ghanta Ghar Ramlila Ground and Kailash Mansarovar Bhawan.“On Monday we had to increase the centres to 29 which were given Covaxin. This is because we had only about 2,500 doses of Covishield with on the day,” said GP Mathuria, nodal officer for Covid vaccination.The state government supplies vaccines to the districts depending on the requirement and how much stock the central government has supplied to them.The health department officials said it was rare when the Covaxin vaccination was higher than the Covishield.“On Monday, the entire Dasna region had only Covaxin shots. We expect around 30,000 Covishield doses by Monday night that will help us resume Covishield vaccinations from Tuesday,” said Dr Mathuria.Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter), said he did not expect the “rare day” to have a major impact on vaccination coverage.“ With Covishield supply higher, a shift in the share of the stock available may have led to many second Covishield dose beneficiaries to return home without getting their shot,” he said. “But the focus must be to increase vaccine stocks to about 20,000 to 25,000 a day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/covishield-in-short-supply-ghaziabad-forced-to-operate-29-centres-with-covaxin-101629742586187.html
23-08-2021||Noida||Noida falls short of target to vaccinate 12K as turnout dips||The Gautam Budh Nagar district on Monday failed to ramp up the inoculation drive as it administered only 6,589 doses of Covid-19 vaccines at 26 government inoculation centres. The district health department on Sunday decided to accelerate the vaccination drive in the district, saying that more than 12,000 doses would be administered at 27 government-run Covid vaccination centres (CVCs).According to officials, since the UP government had announced three-day (from Saturday to Monday) state mourning to condole the demise of former chief minister Kalyan Singh, the district administration decided to postpone the vaccination at one of the centres, i.e. at the Noida Entrepreneurs Association (NEA) building.GB Nagar district magistrate, Suhas LY, said that most of the CVCs witnessed low turnout as people thought that the centres would be closed on account of the state mourning. “The district hospital in Sector 30 and the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) administered as many as 1,500 doses each. The district health department made vaccination centres in a planned way, so that even the people residing in remote areas could easily come to the booths to get their jabs,” he said. The officials said that apart from primary health centres (PHCs) and community health centres (CHCs), the vaccination centres have also been made at some government schools and community halls. “This week, we are hopeful to cross the last week’s vaccination figures of 76,124,” Suhas said. The DM further said that out of the total 1,589,815 eligible population, as many as 1,490,951 have taken at least one dose till Monday evening, which is nearly 94% of the total eligible population. “Though there is a statewide paucity of vaccines, we hope that by the end of October, everyone of this eligible lot will have at least one dose of the vaccines,” he said. Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district immunisation officer, said that at present, the district health department is left with around 40,000 doses of vaccines. “We got 26,000 doses of vaccines on Monday. With this stock, we can easily run the drive for three more days with the same pace. However, we’ve sent our requisition for more vaccines to the state health department,” he said.The officials said that three health care workers and two policemen were deployed at each centre for the smooth vaccination drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-falls-short-of-target-to-vaccinate-12k-as-turnout-dips-101629742526213.html
23-08-2021||Noida||Roller coaster ride awaits RRTS users on 17km priority section in Ghaziabad||Riders of the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) will have an experience like no other— a sort of roller coaster journey that would see them go from below the Hindon elevated road to above the Delhi Metro’s Red Line near the New Bus Adda metro station. The NCR Transport Corporation (NCRTC) has completed the construction of pillars that will allow high-speed trains to traverse five major infrastructures in Ghaziabad under the 17km priority section of the line from Sahibabad to Duhai.The 82km stretch of the RRTS, between Delhi and Meerut, is being built at a cost of ₹30,274 crore. The priority section will be the first stretch to be operationalised — March 2023 — and the full project is likely to be commissioned in 2025.“The 17km priority section was a major engineering challenge as the existing infrastructure posed hindrance to the alignment of the rapid line. Our teams overcame these hurdles with the help of IT enabled systems and timely planning. The varying gradient, acceleration and deceleration of trains were kept in mind while erecting the alignment,” said Puneet Vats, chief PRO of NCRTC.The height of the pillars under the priority section ranges from just eight metres to 22.5 metres.The official said after emerging from the underground section near Kaushambi, trains will be at grade with the Vaishali Metro station at a height of about 10 metres. It will then encounter its first major structure — the flyover crossing near Vasundhara where the pillars and alignment have been raised to a height of 16 metres against the standard height of 10 metres.The tracks will turn and run parallel to the Delhi-Howrah railway section where rapid trains will zoom past below the city’s Hindon elevated road at a pillar height of about eight metres before crossing the railway tracks and river Hindon.“Towards the New Bus Adda metro station, the trains will move on tracks raised to a height of about 22.5 metres that will take it above the Metro line (Red Line). Here, we also have a major interchange station which will connect passengers to the Delhi Metro,” Vats said.From there, trains will further move over the median of the Delhi-Meerut Road on pillars built at standard height, which will be raised to about 12.5 metres to avoid the split-shaped Raj Nagar Extension flyover.Finally, the height will further be raised to 15 metres which will allow the rapid trains to move above the Eastern Peripheral Expressway and proceed towards Modinagar and Meerut.“It will be an exhilarating experience for passengers as the high-speed trains will move above and below the different infrastructure projects and they will be able to view the city’s skyline very closely. The priority section has started taking shape and different system contractors have started works like laying of tracks, installation of signalling, overhead electricity lines and electricity distribution works,” said an officer from NCRTC.The work on five RRTS stations under the priority section have moved to the next level at Sahibabad, New Bus Adda (Ghaziabad), Guldhar, Duhai and Duhai depot.The actual operational speed of the rapid trains will be 160kmph, while their average speed will be about 100kmph. Of the 82km, a 70km RRTS section will be elevated.BOX: How the high-speed rapid trains will moveHeight of 16 metres near the Vasundhara flyoverHeight of 8 metres and below the Hindon elevated roadHeight of 22.5 metres and above the Red line metro new New Bus Adda metro stationHeight of 12.5 and will run between the two sides of the Raj Nagar Extension flyoverHeight of 15 metres and above the Eastern Peripheral Expressway||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/roller-coaster-ride-awaits-rrts-users-on-17km-priority-section-in-ghaziabad-101629742406283.html
23-08-2021||Delhi||Teachers want DU to hold back on implementation of NEP, seek feedback||On the eve of Delhi University’s academic council (AC) meeting on Tuesday, several teachers and AC members raised concerns over the university’s decision to push for reforms advocated in the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and have demanded that the recommendations prepared by the DU-NEP committee be opened up for wider consultations instead of placing them before the council in Tuesday’s meeting. The Standing Committee on Academic Matters, however, passed agenda on implementation of the four-year undergraduate programme structure with effect from 2022-23 despite opposition from teachers. The committee recorded a note of dissent from three members. The Standing Committee had to defer the agenda on the implementation of SWAYAM (India’s massive open online course platform) due to opposition from teachers. Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) has however opposed the decision and called for a strike Tuesday ahead of the scheduled AC meeting. “The University administration will have to face greater opposition tomorrow both inside and outside the Academic Council. The DUTA has called for Strike and protest outside VC Office on the matter,” said DUTA treasurer Abha Dev Habib, adding that the experience of FYUP in 2013 shows that students rejected the idea of additional expenditure for the fourth year. In 2014, DU was mired in controversy after the then administration introduced the four-year undergraduate programme (FYUP). It was scrapped later that year amid protests by students and teachers. On Saturday, Hindustan Times reported that the university was planning to table the recommendations made by the 42-member committee on how to implement NEP in the varsity from the next academic year (2022-23). The agenda items include the return of the four-year undergraduate programme with a focus on multidisciplinary research, innovation, and social-emotional learning; multiple entry-exit points in undergraduate courses; introduction of the academic bank of credits; appointment of international faculty members; and discontinuation of the MPhil programme from the next academic session. During the meeting of the standing committee on academic matters on Monday, several AC members raised their voices against the “loss of workload” that may result from the proposed NEP structure. “This document at this stage is not fit for discussion in the academic council and needs a major re-haul and that is possible only when it is sent for feedback from teachers in the committee of courses and the staff council,” said Mithuraaj Dhusiya, member, academic council. Teachers argue that due to the design of the multiple entry and exit schemes (MEES) and academic bank of credit (ABC) — which allow students to exit from one course at any point and save their academic credits to use at other universities — students can earn credits for non-core courses from other universities, thereby reducing the workload. The four-year undergraduate programme comprising 196 credits has just 84 credits allotted to core courses; that means, 57.14% of total credits can be earned in four years from other universities. In a dissent note submitted to the university on Monday with three signatories of 36 members in the standing committee, DU teachers said, “The DU has not asked for detailed feedback on the report of the NEP implementation from all stakeholders, including members of all relevant statutory bodies. The fixing of the academic year 2022-23 as the year of implementation of NEP 2020 is baseless as first, there needs to be detailed discussion and wider consultation on NEP 2020 among all stakeholders and only then can we determine whether NEP 2020 will be feasible in DU at all.” Another academic council member Ratnesh R Saxena said, “Encouraging blended teaching through provisions of ABC and MOOCS on Swayam [online] Portal in which students can earn 40% of their credits through the online mode and transfer them for their degree would not only drastically reduce the workload of institutions but also create an alternative to classroom teaching.” Teachers also said the MEES will encourage more students to drop out. There was also no clarity on job prospects of those who leave an institution with a certificate or diploma after their first or second year of undergraduate course, respectively. “The MEES along with the burden of extra expenditure will encourage drop-outs. This will hit women students as well as others from marginalised and underprivileged sections…The addition of the fourth year will put an additional burden on infrastructure in terms of classrooms, labs, etc. Most colleges do not have any space or scope for further expansion,” the teachers said in the note.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/teachers-want-du-to-hold-back-on-implementation-of-nep-seek-feedback-101629742346167.html
23-08-2021||Lucknow||Escape from Kabul - UP’s Gorakhpur workers return home, narrate trauma||The escape from Taliban was not easy for 40-year-old Ranjit Maurya, a native of Bhaishat village located in Barhalganj block area of Gorakhpur district.Maurya reached his village on Monday morning. Along with 168 other people he was evacuated from strife-torn Kabul by an Indian Air Force C-17 Globemaster. Along with four other people from Gorakhpur region, Maurya boarded a bus from Anand Vihar bus terminus located in Delhi for home. On Monday morning, he reached his village in Gorakhpur district. Maurya said that he was trapped in a steel factory in Kabul along with 28 people from various districts of Uttar Pradesh, after the Taliban took over the Afghan capital on August 15. Even as the owner of the factory, a resident of Afghanistan, assured them of safety, food as well as lodging facilities, the threat issued by the local Taliban commander made them panic.“Sounds of continuous firing by the Taliban, reports of atrocities committed by them after the fall of Kabul, were a nightmare for us. As the Taliban tightened their grip on the city, we lost hope of returning home. The report that the Indian government was making efforts for the evacuation of its citizens rekindled hope in us,” he said.Maurya and other workers contacted their family members over the mobile to inform them about the situation. They requested the family members to contact the Uttar Pradesh and central government for their safe return home. The family members of some workers contacted the local administration to share the location of the people trapped in the steel factory in Kabul, he said. On Saturday, the factory owner told us that personnel of the Indian embassy had contacted him for evacuation of workers trapped in the factory. With the assistance of the local travel agent, buses were sent to the factory to transport the workers to the airport.“The commute from the factory to the airport was full of tense moments. The Taliban could be seen moving on the streets with sophisticated weapons. We were stopped at a barricade erected on the road by the Taliban. They entered the bus, scanned the people seated, and checked our documents and passports. Once it was clear that all the people on the bus were Indian citizens, the bus was permitted to move toward the airport,” he said.“The scenario at the airport was chaotic. Thousands of people were jostling with each other to enter the airport, while the Taliban beat them up mercilessly and fired in the air to scare them. There was virtual mayhem. We thought we would not make it into the airport, but the bus driver managed to enter from a separate gate controlled by security forces,” he said.Maurya, who worked as a welder in the factory, said, “I have been working in Afghanistan since 2017. The locals are friendly and helpful. I got a good salary and the environment was peaceful. Life was good till the situation turned volatile after the Taliban took over the city,” he said.“The factory owner told us that after the situation normalises he will contact us. He will make arrangements for our return to Kabul to run the factory. We have assured him that we will return if the situation in Afghanistan becomes normal and if there was no threat of Taliban,” he added.Thanking the central and state government for making arrangements for their safe return home, Maurya said that all 28 people from UP are skilled workers who went to Afghanistan for livelihood. “We have lost our jobs, the state government and central government should ensure that we get a job in a local factory,” he said.Shailendra Shukla, a resident of Dubauli village near Chauri- Chaura town in Gorakhpur district, was given a grand welcome by family members and villagers after he reached the village on Monday morning. “With the assistance of our government we managed to escape from the clutches of the Taliban,” he said.“On way to the airport, the bus on which we were travelling was hijacked by the Taliban. We were taken to their camp. To scare us they fired in the air. They asked us who all were talking to the media in India on mobile. They checked our documents to ensure that we were not the Afghan citizens fleeing the country. Later, they permitted us to move to the airport,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/escape-from-kabul-gorakhpur-workers-return-home-narrate-trauma-101629741986937.html
23-08-2021||Lucknow||UP govt should revisit budgeting methods, says CAG report||The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has noted that the Uttar Pradesh government was not preparing the state budget on the basis of real estimates and suggested that the budgeting methods should be revisited to make the budget estimates more realistic in Uttar Pradesh. “The finance department should revisit their budgeting methods to make the budget estimates more realistic,” the CAG observed in its recommendation in the report on the revenue sector for the year ending March 31, 2019. The report was tabled in the state assembly during its Monsoon session here on August 18, 2021. Giving details of the budgetary estimates of realisation of tax and non-tax revenue from 2014-2015 to 2019-2019, the CAG pointed towards large variations in budgetary estimates and actual revenue over the years. This is not for the first time that the CAG has made such recommendations. The CAG, in one of its reports tabled in the state legislature here on December 17, 2019, had recommended that the state finance department should rationalise the budget preparation exercise. “The finance department should rationalise the budget preparation exercise, so that the persisting gap between the budget estimate and actuals are bridged,” recommended the CAG in its state finances audit report for the year that ended on March 31, 2019. About the estimates for 2018-2019, the CAG noted, “The overall growth of 23.34 per cent in own tax revenue during the year 2018-2019 (over 2017-2018) was mainly due to increase in State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) by ₹20,734.07 crore, state excise by ₹6606.40 crore, stamps and registration fees by ₹2335.46 crore and taxes on vehicles, goods and passengers by ₹526.33 crore.” The CAG further observed: “There was overall increase of 52.06 per cent in non-tax receipts amounting to ₹10,305.85 crore during the year 2018-2019 over 2017-2018, mainly under the head ‘Interest Receipts’ which was due to more interest realised from loans to sugar mills and investment of cash balances under ‘Miscellaneous General Services’ which was mainly due to more transfers of ₹8271.28 crore from Sinking Fund to this head during the year 2018-2019 in comparison to that in 2017-2018.” The CAG pointed towards the delayed response by the various departments, noting that a recoverable amount of ₹11,533.96 crore was brought to the notice of various departments in 12044 inspection reports (IRs) issued up to March 2019. It said even the first replies, required from heads of offices within four weeks of submission of the IRs, have not been received in time. It recommended that the state government should evolve a mechanism to ensure that the departments promptly responded to the IRs. The CAG also took exception to delays in submitting reply by the departments to the observations made in the audit reports. “Significant delays were observed in submission of explanatory notes (replies of the departments) itself, with delays ranging between 193 days and 809 days in respect of 36 paragraphs (including performance audits) appearing in the CAG’s revenue audit report for the year ending March 31, 2014. Moreover, explanatory notes were not received (September 2020) for audit reports for the years 2014-2015, 2015-2016, 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 which were placed before the state legislative assembly between August 2015 to February 2020,” observed the CAG. A table given in the report noted that out of 140 paragraphs of audit reports for August 2015 to February 2020, no explanatory note was received for 104 paragraphs. The CAG noted that in order to ensure accountability of the executive, the department of finance had issued instructions in June 1987 to initiate suo motu action on all paragraphs/performance audits figuring in the audit reports irrespective of whether the cases were taken up for examination by the Public Accounts Committee or not. “What the CAG has drawn attention to is an appropriate point. In the last many years, the state government has been overestimating both the revenue and the expenditure of its budget. Scoring a political point is one of the reasons the party in power wants to project a bigger size than the previous one without looking at the ground realities.

Underground utilities include facilities such as gas pipelines, fibre optic cables and electrical wires, among others.“A GPR survey is needed for planning new infrastructure in the city as it is not always known what is there underneath the ground. Anyone applying for a project, be it telecommunication or electrical work, must conduct a survey and submit it with the application, but there was no in-house equipment till now to validate that survey. Due to this, many times, there have been discrepancies in the final approved design and work carried out on the ground,” said Singh.According to GMDA records, the authority has GPR data for approximately 400 kilometres submitted by various agencies for previous infrastructure works, but there is no system to ensure the validity of this data.During the meeting, the chief executive officer had said, “...the applicant for getting ROW may be asked to submit report of survey with machine of higher specification along with application and can be counter checked with the GPR machine.”Officials could not share details of the cost and type of machine to be procured as it is being decided based on the project needs of the infrastructure I and II divisions of the authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gmda-to-procure-machine-to-check-underground-utilities-before-starting-projects-101629741808221.html

The court also reserved praise for the Gurugram police officials over the investigation and said that the investigation could serve as a model for such probes.In compliance with an August 16 order, Amitava Chatterjee, a chief general manager of the State Bank of India appeared before the court through videoconferencing and said that the bank has a policy under which victims subjected to fraud are reimbursed but that in the present case, there are certain “leads/clues” indicating the involvement of the complainant or his relatives in the crime. Chatterjee said that a departmental inquiry against the officials concerned of the bank has been completedThe court directed the bank to submit the report of the departmental inquiry. The police were also directed to investigate the involvement of the complainant or others related to him in the crime and a status report. The next hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.The police commissioner and assistant commissioner of police (DLF) were praised by the bench of justice Arun Kumar Tyagi, who observed that the investigation of the fraud was difficult.“The court appreciates the effective steps taken by the Gurugram police commissioner and Karan Goel, assistant commissioner of police, in-charge of SIT and action taken by them in this case, which was a difficult one for an investigator and now present a model to be followed in investigation of similar cases,” the bench observed.The investigation also exposed irregularities in issuing SIM cards by a leading telecom company, as around 500 SIM cards were issued without proper documentation. The police said they have already registered two FIRs and arrested seven persons, including the mastermind, Praveen Mittal, from Delhi.“Such observations by the court will uplift the morale of the entire team and the police. We put in a lot of effort in the investigation and appreciation from the court is a motivation for the entire team,” said Goel.Goel said that the farmer did not receive the one-time password on his mobile phone and that facial mapping was also not done by the bank when Mittal went to the bank posing as the farmer, identified as Lila Ram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/multicrore-fraud-hc-seeks-bank-report-praises-ggm-cops-101629741806559.html

He was 89. After studying in Australia, Baker joined the college in 1969 and was associated with it since then. Teachers and former students said he had been keeping unwell for the past few months due to old age.“It is with deep sorrow that I inform all of us of the passing away of Dr. Baker, senior-most and beloved teacher of this College (from 1969 onwards) in the early hours of August 23, 2021,” principal John Varghese announced Monday.Baker, who was a bachelor, frequently visited his two siblings in Australia before the pandemic. A teacher for nearly 30 years, Baker was instrumental in developing the college archives and was also working on documenting the history of St Stephen’s College. He was also a ‘block tutor’ — a senior guiding figure for each block in the college campus — to several batches of students.Following his demise, tributes poured in from all corners on Monday. Former Delhi Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung, who was a student of Baker’s, called the teacher “one of his closest friends.” Jung said the two spoke on the phone around 10 days ago and planned to meet next month.“David joined St Stephen’s when I was in my second year of college. He and I were the closest of friends for the past 50 years, and he is a part of our family. While preparing for the civil services examination, he gave me his own notes on British history and modern Indian history. He told me that if I didn’t make the IAS in my first attempt, he would be upset. We kept in touch throughout all these years and he visited me even when I was posted in Madhya Pradesh, Manila, and England. He taught my daughter as well, so it is a personal loss for us,” he said.Congress MP and St Stephen’s alumnus Shashi Tharoor also tweeted his condolences.“Profoundly saddened by the passing of my teacher and “block tutor” at St Stephens College, Dr David Baker, who became an Indian citizen and mentored two generations of students,” the MP said, expressing regret over missing Baker’s funeral which is slated to take place on Tuesday while following the Covid-19 restrictions on funerals.Most of Baker’s colleagues and former students remember him for his connection with the student community. “His memory was so good that he remembered most of the students from each of the batches. Even after he retired, he would voluntarily take classes in college so that he could interact with students and they could learn from him. He has left an indelible mark on his students including me,” said Malay Neerav, the head of the history department at St. Stephen’s College.Neerav was also Baker’s colleague for over a decade from 1986 to 1997, and said he was taught by the historian. “Baker took Indian citizenship because he wanted to spend his life on the college campus. He devoted his life to St. Stephen’s and spent his last days documenting the history of St. Stephen’s and tying it to the history of Delhi. He also played an instrumental role in developing the archive department of the college library,” he said.Historian Shahid Amin, a retired professor from Delhi University’s history department, said that Baker was a robust academic along with being a great teacher who stayed in touch with his former students as well.“Baker was a devoted teacher and a professional historian which was rare in the late ’60s. He was a diligent academic and continued with his work even after his retirement. When he joined Stephen’s in 1969, he had already published a paper on Rowlatt Satyagraha with a noted publication. He was not just a teacher but an institution who has done meticulous research on Indian history and the role of central provinces in the freedom struggle,” he said.Author and historian Swapna Liddle said Baker had worked extensively as a PhD scholar in India. “..In my third year in college I saw a different side of him on a history department trip to Indore, Mandu, Maheshwar, etc. He knew all the little dhabas and dharamshalas, as he had been coming to these places ever since his years working on the history of the region as a young PhD scholar from Australia,” she wrote on Facebook.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/historian-former-du-teacher-david-baker-dies-aged-89-101629741807007.html

Ahmed had also left his job over the unpaid dues and started his own online kitchen which hurt the suspect’s khamiri roti business.According to police, Salam had gone to the house to allegedly kill Ahmed but ended up stabbing his father, Mohammad Israr. Police said that they received a PCR call regarding a stabbing in Nand Nagri’s B block area at 9.55 pm, soon after which a cop was rushed to the spot. The victim was rushed to GTB hospital where he was declared dead on arrival.Israr’s daughter informed police about Salam and the tiff over her brother’s salary dues. She said Salam used to threaten his brother every now and then after he started a competing business.According to police, she said she had went to a nearby market to purchase household items around 9.40pm when her landlord’s daughter called her about Salam hurling abuses at their doorstep. By the time she returned, she alleged Salam had stabbed her father with a butcher’s knife and, when she tried to intervene, he attacker her as well before fleeing.Deputy commissioner of police (northeast) Sanjay Sain said that based on her statement, an FIR was registered under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) at Nand Nagari police station.Police said they carried out several raids, including his native place in Uttar Pradesh’s Amethi, but to no avail.Later, based on his call data records, Salam’s location was traced and he was arrested near the Mandoli flyover. Police said they also recovered the weapon used in the crime.According to police, Salam confessed to the crime during questioning, and confirmed the bad blood with Ahmed over the salary dues and his competing khamiri roti business.He allegedly told police that he ended up killing Ijhar as he could not find Ahmed at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/annoyed-by-reminders-of-salary-dues-competing-business-man-stabs-former-employee-s-father-in-nand-nagri-arrested-101629741749571.html
23-08-2021||Gurugram||MCG may allow CNG autos in electric vehicle zone||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is contemplating allowing autorickshaws running on compressed natural gas (CNG) to operate in the electric three-wheelers zone, which came into effect on August 16, following protests by drivers, officials familiar with the developments said on Monday.Members of the Haryana Auto Chalak Sangathan (drivers’ union) met with the MCG commissioner, Mukesh Kumar Ahuja, at the MCG office in Sector 34 regarding the civic body’s electric three-wheeler zone (ETWZ) that was flagged off by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar.The zone covers areas of DLF Phases 1, 2, 3 and 4, DLF-5, Golf Course Road, Mall Mile, and Cyber City, where diesel or CNG autorickshaws have, so far, not been allowed to ply. The zone is reserved for e-rickshaws and e-autos, 600 of which were also flagged off last week, along with the launch of the electric zone.A senior MCG official, wishing not to be named, said, “The pollution from CNG is far lower than diesel autorickshaws. It is one of the cleaner modes of public transport currently and we will issue a clarification later this week, allowing them to operate within the electric zone.”However, a second MCG official said that the civic body had never disallowed CNG autorickshaws from operating in the electric zone.“The MCG never raised the issue of restricting the movement of CNG vehicles inside the ETWZ. Our concessionaire raised the issue stating that its plying would defeat the purpose of an ETWZ during a meeting with MCG officials, transport department and Gurugram traffic police last month. However, the same was never officially implemented or stated anywhere in writing,” the second MCG official, who had attended the meeting, said.However, members of auto unions said that at certain stretches, especially on Hamilton Court Road, drivers of CNG autos have been penalised by the traffic police.“Due to miscommunication, the MCG commissioner informed us that CNG autorickshaws were also added inadvertently and the same was also later announced by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar during the project inauguration. The MCG commissioner assured us that the civic body will look into the matter and inform us about the final decision in a meeting with the union leaders later this week,” said Yogesh Sharma, state general secretary, Haryana Auto Chalak Sanghatan.According to the auto union members, Ahuja said that the idea behind MCG’s e-vehicle zone was to solely phase out diesel autos.Currently, no diesel autos are allowed to enter ETWZ. The auto union is also pressing the MCG to grant diesel autorickshaw drivers more time to make the switch to e-three wheelers.According to Sharma, around 9,000 CNG autos are operating in Gurugram. “We want the MCG’s decision to include CNG autos in writing. Until then, we will continue to pursue our demands. A group of leaders and drivers are meeting at the Leisure Valley Park in Sector 29 on Tuesday to take a call on whether to stage another round of protest or pursue the matter in other ways,” said Sharma.Since the launch of the electric zone, autorickshaw union leaders and drivers have staged multiple protests at the Mini Secretariat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-may-allow-cng-autos-in-electric-vehicle-zone-101629741747766.html

Thirteen villagers have been arrested in the case so far, said Sushil Kumar Nayak, sub-divisional police officer of Gadchandur. “More arrests are likely as investigation is in the preliminary stage,” said Santosh Ambike, assistant police inspector of Jivta. According to information, the villagers suspected that the dalit family was practising witchcraft. The family members were summoned to the village square where a mob humiliated by throwing mud at them and indiscriminately thrashed them. Later, the crowd tied three of them, including two women, to wooden poles and thrashed them with sticks and punches. The mob then turned to four other members of the families and assaulted them too, Nayak informed.Five of the seven persons were shifted to government-run Chandrapur medical college and hospital after their condition turned serious. They have been identified as Shantabai Bhagwan Kamble, 53; Sahebrao Eknath Hooke, 48; Dhammashila Sudhakar Hooke, 38; Panchfula Shivraj Hooke, 55; and Prayagbai Eknath, 31. Lok Sabha member and Congress leader Balu Dhanorkar condemned the incident and visited the government-run medical college and hospital and enquired about the victims from the hospital authorities. District police superintendent Arvind Salve and other senior district officials visited the village on Monday. Apart from this, a team of Andhshraddha Nirmulan Samiti headed by one Anil Dahegaonkar visited the village and held a meeting to raise awareness among villagers against black magic. He also demanded that the state power, which has adopted a law passed in this regard, should take the initiative to create awareness after such incidents. The police are on high alert. People coming from outside the village are being allowed to enter the village only after interrogation. Nayak said that adequate police bandobast has been deployed in the village to maintain law and order there. “We are looking into this seriously and are hopeful to arrest the remaining accused in this regard soon,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/7-members-of-a-dalit-family-beaten-up-over-suspicion-of-black-magic-101629741686577.html

The girl’s mother said that her daughter came to the city from Jharkhand in 2019 with her aunt, who got her a job at the apartment through a placement agency, but she was not being allowed to leave by her employers as well as the agency.The police said that a kidnapping case was lodged in the Gumla district of Jharkhand, the girl’s home town, around 18 months ago. The mother approached the child welfare committee last week, but as the apartment was locked, she returned to Jharkhand and later that week, the girl was rescued by the police. The police said they are probing the incident and have not filed a case yet.Deepak Kumar, the Childline coordinator for Gurugram, said that they received an anonymous call on their helpline number 1098 on Saturday, informing them that a minor was working as a domestic help in The Magnolias society in DLF-5. “We formed a team and with help of the Sushant Lok police station rescued the minor. Her medical examination was conducted and she was found to be fit. The girl alleged that she wanted to return home, but neither her employer nor the placement agency let her leave. She was not in touch with her family members for the past five months, but had called them before that and informed them that she was working (as a help) in an apartment,” he said.The girl was sent to a shelter home after her statement was recorded before a duty magistrate on Sunday. As per the rules, the minimum age for employment as a domestic help is 18 years, but the girl was being employed as one since she was 14 years old.Sonia Yadav, a member of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), said that the girl’s mother contacted them last week and informed them regarding the placement agency. The helpline officials took the details from the placement agency and alerted the police on Saturday, she said.Kumar said that a probe is underway and action will be taken against the family and placement agency once the investigation is completed.Jasvir Singh, the station house officer of Sushant Lok police station, said that they informed Jharkhand police as a case was already registered there. “We had sent a team with the Childline and CWC team and the minor has been sent to a shelter home. We have informed her mother, who will be reaching in a day or two from Jharkhand. Based on their complaint, action will be initiated,” he said.A DLF spokesperson, on Monday, said, “All security-related protocols have been followed with regard to this incident. We have and will continue to extend all the support to all authorities investigating the incident.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/child-labour-16-year-old-domestic-help-rescued-from-magnolias-in-dlf5-101629741566601.html

This is the first time that the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) got genome sequencing report within a week. The Delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2 of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, was first detected in India in late 2020. This variant, which continues to be the dominant variant across the globe, has now spread to 80 countries.Genome sequencing is an exercise to study the changes in the structure of the virus over time. A combination of changes in the ribonucleic acid of the virus can give birth to a new variant.The hospital requires to undertake further tests to identify Delta Plus variants. “In the first cycle, 65% of the samples tested positive for the Delta variant. Two samples have been identified with Alpha variant and 24 with Kappa,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.When asked if any sample tested positive for Delta Plus, Dr Jayanti Shastri, in-charge of the molecular diagnostic reference laboratory of the hospital, said, “We need further tests for that.”Delta Plus (AY.1) is a mutation of the highly transmissible Delta variant and was detected in the state during the second wave. In June, the Union health ministry declared it as the variant of concern.The 188 samples which were tested were collected from international passengers, Covid-19 hot spots, places with high transmission rate among others. On August 4, the hospital inaugurated the machines for genome sequencing, making it the first civic-run hospital to conduct the tests in the state. After over two weeks of installation process, the hospital started the procedure of genome sequencing on August 17. The results of the first cycle were declared on Monday. “We started the first stage on August 17 and boarded the samples for sequencing on August 20. The reports of the analysis came on Monday,” she said. Whole genome sequencing tests comprise three phases—library presentation which in simple form is called pre-sequencing preparation, which takes two-three days. The researchers sequence the samples in the machine that generally takes 4-5 hours. In the third stage, they analyse the results to understand the variations. Since genome sequencing is not a diagnostic tool, suspected Covid-19 patients will have to undergo compulsory RT-PCR for the diagnosis.“Unlike RT-PCR which is a target-based testing, sequencing helps to identify unknown pathogens that will help us to understand the genetic coding of the viruses,” she said. As HT reported earlier, the machines have been procured through donations that cumulatively cost around ₹10.5 crore. An US-based biotech company has donated ₹6.4 crore. Mumbai-based ATE Chandra Foundation has donated ₹4 crore for the machine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/65-samples-test-positive-for-delta-variant-in-genome-sequencing-at-kasturba-hospital-101629741506637.html

DTCP officials said that the flat owners had approached a local court but were not granted relief.A restoration order implies that illegal construction or developments will have to be removed. In case property owners don’t follow the orders, then FIRs would be registered against the violators, said DTCP officials.Around 135 flats have been constructed in violation of rules in the Sai Lane Colony of Old Gurugram. The department had earlier issued notices to the landowners, flat owners and property dealers involved in the construction, development and sale of these properties.“We will issue restoration order to the flat owners and landowners in the next couple of days for construction of flats without any permission from the competent authority. We had submitted in the court that due course of law was followed in issuing notices earlier and there was no arbitrary action,” said RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement).Bhath also said that details about the property deeds were sought from the revenue department. “We have also sought information from civic agencies as to how water and power connections were issued,” he said.DTCP officials said that they have got clear instructions from their headquarters in Chandigarh that the construction of multiple flats on agricultural land or without permission from competent authority would not be allowed in the district. “We have taken action on complaints that have been lodged and areas where our officials have conducted surveys. I appeal to the city residents to apprise the department through phone or email if any violations are happening in their areas. We will take immediate action in such matters,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/sai-lane-colony-will-have-to-be-restored-says-dtcp-101629741448674.html

A case of attempt to murder was registered and efforts are on to trace the suspect, the police said.Despite seven years having passed since their marriage, the suspect held a grudge and attacked his brother-in-law along with two accomplices on Saturday night. The victim suffered a bullet injury to his right shoulder and is stable after undergoing surgery, the police said.Hitesh Yadav, the assistant commissioner of police (Manesar), said that the victim was taken to a private hospital in Gurugram and was undergoing treatment. “He was operated upon and a bullet injury was reported. We recorded his statement on Sunday, following which a case was registered against the suspect and raids are being conducted to arrest him,” he said. A case under sections 307 (attempt to murder), and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and sections of the Arms Act was registered at the Farrukhnagar police station on Sunday. According to the police, the victim, Rajesh Saini, runs a gym in Farrukhnagar. He wanted to marry a woman from Rewari but their families objected to it due to caste differences, following which they eloped.Saini said that after a few months, the situation got normal and his wife’s parents got them married as per their rituals and accepted him as their son-in-law. “My brother-in-law, Sachin Kumar, was unhappy with our marriage and often threatened me with dire consequences,” he said. On the day of the incident, Saini was sleeping when around 11.45pm, his brother-in-law rang the doorbell. “I went out and opened the door and found my brother-in-law standing there along with two others. My wife was sleeping in the same room but did not come out as she thought someone from the village was visiting for some work. As soon as I opened the door, Kumar threatened my life and said he would teach me a lesson. He held me at gunpoint before I could react or raise the alarm. I tried to run inside but he shot at me on my right shoulder and I lost my balance,” he said. After firing the shot, the trio fled the spot as Saini and his wife locked themselves inside their bedroom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/man-shoots-brother-in-law-for-eloping-with-his-sister-seven-years-ago-101629741447674.html
23-08-2021||Gurugram||Delhi-Jaipur carriageway of Iffco Chowk flyover shut after retaining wall collapses||The carriageway of the Iffco Chowk flyover leading from Delhi to Jaipur was shut on Monday morning after a portion of the flyover’s retaining wall collapsed.According to the officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), a sewerage pipeline that passes under the flyover was damaged on Saturday following heavy rainfall, which led to rainwater accumulation and subsequently, damaged the retaining wall.Retaining walls are relatively rigid walls used for supporting soil laterally so that they can be retained at different levels on the two sides. Iffco Chowk is one of the busiest traffic junctions in the city and the parallel flyover for traffic to move from Delhi to Jaipur was completed in 2019 as part of a project launched in 2016 to decongest the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway.Vikas Mittal, senior manager, NHAI, said that drains and sewer pipelines were flooded over the weekend due to heavy rain in the city, and even on Monday, a heavy flow of water was witnessed at the site where the sewer pipeline was damaged. The pipeline runs parallel to the flyover but it wan untouched during the construction of the flyover and it does not bear the vertical load of the structure.“Due to heavy flow of water, pressure built up internally in the sewer pipeline due to which it burst and caused damage to the retaining wall. The collection of water led to erosion of earth and collapse of retaining wall panels of the flyover. The NHAI team, contractor of the project and local officials have surveyed the damage and initiated work to get it repaired at the earliest,” he said.Officials of Gawar Constructions, the contractor for the project, said that they are waiting for the local authorities to repair the sewage pipeline after which they will repair the flyover. Traffic flow is likely to resume on Tuesday after necessary repairs are carried out, they said.A senior executive of Gawar Constructions, who did not wish to be named, said, “The panels of the wall are still stuck with belts and these will be repaired in two to three days. This time, we have decided to pour concrete under the structure to ensure that a similar problem does not arise in the future.”A senior official of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority, which is responsible for the maintenance of the pipeline, said that an old segment that ran from Ambience Mall to Rajiv Chowk was damaged and the authority had already given approval for repairing the entire pipeline. “The pipeline is old and we have already finalised plan to repair it in the entirety. The localised damage is being repaired to ensure flyover becomes functional at the earliest,” the official said. In August 2019, the L-shaped underpass constructed at Iffco chowk for movement of traffic from Huda City Centre towards Iffco Chowk had caved in after heavy rains inundated the stormwater drains and sewage pipelines. The cave-in took place on both sides of the road and damaged the extension joints and the concrete wall of the underpass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/delhijaipur-carriageway-of-iffco-chowk-flyover-shut-after-retaining-wall-collapses-101629741446726.html

23-08-2021||Dehradun||Cong, AAP adopt new tactics to target BJP in Uttarakhand||Dehradun: The opposition Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) are attempting to capitalise on the priests’ protests against the Uttarakhand government’s takeover of the management of Char Dham shrines and associated temples to target the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government ahead of the state assembly elections early next year.The state BJP says the statements reflect the parties’ desperation to gain people’s attention for electoral mileage. Experts say people of Uttarakhand, though religious at the level of personal faith, do not primarily vote on the basis of Hindutva talk by the parties.Congress leader Harish Rawat, who is the head of the party’s election campaign committee, has made it clear in recent statements that he won’t allow the BJP to monopolise the Hindutva agenda.“Without any political colour, our people here use the name of Shiva, Bhole Nath. Our state is Dev Bhoomi. BJP uses the name of Lord Ram. Here, our people, our party cadre use the name of Shiva and Ganesh ji. We started election campaigning with ‘Jai Bhole Nath’. Our workers will continue to use it in election campaigning, and it has nothing to do with politics,” the former chief minister said.Rawat said the Congress has decided to start Parivartan yatra in the state from September 3 from Khatima in Kumaon. “If BJP has Lord Ram, we have Bhole Nath, Lord Ganesh, in whose name the Parivartan yatra will be started to get back the pride of the Dev Bhoomi, the land of gods.”The former CM claimed the BJP has been using Hindutva for political ends as they don’t understand the finer tenets of Sanatan Dharma, which believes in the collective good of all people. “When it comes to agitating priests, we have to be more sensitive regarding what they want. They have been managing shrines for centuries,” he said.Priests have been agitating against the Char Dham Board for the last two years. Angry with the state government’s vacillating the stand over the issue, they have warned the BJP of withdrawing their backing to the party if a decision on scarping the Char Dham Board is not taken by September 1.The Congress has not only come out in support of the priests but also decided to raise the issue in the monsoon session of the state assembly, which started on Monday and will continue till August 27. Congress’s Dharchula MLA Harish Dhami intends to move a private bill on the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Act in the assembly session.Pandit Vinod Prasad Shukla, president of Teerath Purohit Samaj Shri Kedarnath, said scores of people from the priest and Brahmin community have already left the BJP.“We have waited enough. We have been protesting for the last two years and the government is still framing committees in the matter. If they don’t take a decision by September 1, a large number of people from our community will leave BJP,” Shukla said.In April this year, then chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat announced that the state government will review the formation of Char Dham Devasthanam Board. But when Pushkar Singh Dhami took over the reins of the state, he announced the formation of a high-powered committee that will talk with all stakeholders, following which a decision will be taken on the status of the Char Dham Board.But the agitating priests are not happy with this.Santosh Trivedi, a priest from Kedarnath shrine and vice president of Akhil Bharatiya Teerath Purohit Yuva Mahasabha, wrote a letter with his blood earlier this month to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, demanding scrapping of the Char Dham Devasthanam Board and allowing priests to manage the shrines. He said they had never imagined that BJP government will play with the rights of the priests, who have been managing the shrines for centuries.The AAP, which has announced free power to people in the state, has also signalled a change in its tactics. On August 17, Delhi chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal announced in Dehradun that AAP will make Uttarakhand the spiritual capital for the Hindus across the world. AAP, which plans to contest on all the 70 seats in the state assembly, feels that if it has to gain a foothold in state politics, it cannot ignore the Hindutva factor.State AAP unit president SS Kaler said the BJP has been using Hindutva for political ends, but AAP wants to link Hindutva with strengthening the local economy.“What Arvind Kejriwal meant by saying that AAP wants to make Uttarakhand the spiritual capital for Hindus across the world is that if we are elected to power, we will develop each shrine and promote it at global level among the Hindus, so that they come here and contribute to strengthening the economy of the people around these pilgrimage sites. By making Uttarakhand the spiritual capital for Hindus at the global level, we are also attracting their contribution in developing the Dev Bhoomi.”The state BJP said the statements show their desperation to gain attention of the people but expressed confidence that the people will continue to repose faith in the BJP.“It is strange why Congress or AAP is suddenly reminded of Hindutva, that too when elections are near,” state BJP vice president Devendra Bhasin said.“Whether it is Congress or AAP, people know their history and what they have done so far. People know whether they are for Hindus or others. This sudden gravitation of both these parties towards Hindutva issues shows their desperation. But people of the state will see through the façade and again repose their faith in BJP. For us Hindutva is not a political ideology but a way of life,” he said.Political analyst Prof SS Semwal, who teaches political science at Garhwal university, said religion has always been a strong undercurrent in Uttarakhand, the land of gods.“But that undercurrent is more at the level of personal faith, not that much at the level of politics. I don’t think people of this state will primarily vote based on what these parties think about Hindutva. There may be some sections who may vote on these issues. But overall voters here are more worried about unemployment, migration, poor healthcare and so on. But with the elections nearing, these parties want to cover all corners. So, they are talking about Hindutva themes and attacking BJP on the same,” Semwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/cong-aap-adopt-new-tactics-to-target-bjp-in-uttarakhand-101629740910292.html
23-08-2021||Chandigarh||DSP suspended for letting outsiders meet dera head during hospital visit||The Haryana government on Monday placed Meham DSP Shamsher Singh Dahiya under suspension for allowing unauthorised access of visitors, including two women, to Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh during his travels for medical examination to Delhi’s AIIMS on July 13. The dera head has been serving life sentence at Rohtak’s Sunaria jail for raping his two disciples. Dahiya was the officer in-charge of the security during some of the recent out-of-prison visits of the dera head. Hindustan Times was the first to report on August 19 about the security lapses during dera head’s visit to AIIMS. “The governor of Haryana is pleased to place the services of Sh. Shamsher Singh, HPS, DSP/Meham under suspension with immediate effect. During suspension period he will be entitled to subsistence allowance as admissible under rule-83 of Haryana Civil Services (General) Rules-2016. During suspension his headquarter will be in the office of DGP Haryana, Panchkula, and he will not leave the station without the prior permission of the competent authority (sic.),” the government order said. Rohtak DSP Sajjan Kumar, in a communication to the Rohtak SP, wrote that during a July 13 visit to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, four persons, including two women, were given unauthorised access to meet the dera chief on the hospital premises. Kumar said when he objected to the presence of these persons citing security risks and protocol, he was told by Dahiya that he got a phone call from Chandigarh to facilitate the meeting of the dera head with these persons. DSP Kumar had said after completion of medical examination and tests at AIIMS, the Dera chief boarded Dahiya’s vehicle on the way back to Rohtak prison. As per Kumar’s communication, the vehicle with dera chief on board made multiple unscheduled stops en-route where two women were also allowed to board the vehicle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dsp-suspended-for-letting-outsiders-meet-dera-head-during-hospital-visit-101629740909177.html
23-08-2021||Other||Chakma groups reject proposed relocation move from Arunachal Pradesh, write to PM Modi||Chakma and Hajong groups have rejected a purported move by the Arunachal Pradesh government to relocate them to another state, officials said. Chakmas and Hajongs, who are Buddhists and Hindus, migrated to India between 1964 and 1966 from Chittagong Hills Tract (CHT) of then East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) to escape religious persecution and were settled in North East Frontier Agency (NEFA), present Arunachal Pradesh. The migrants were settled with a rehabilitation plan and allotted permanent land and provided with financial assistance depending on the size of their families to help rebuild their lives. As per the 2011 census, there are 47,471 Chakmas and Hajongs in Arunachal Pradesh. On Monday, Chakma Development Foundation of India (CDFI) wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat and chief ministers of Arunachal Pradesh and Assam, Pema Khandu and Himanta Biswa Sarma respectively, opposing the move. The letter mentioned that in his Independence Day speech, Khandu had mentioned that Chakmas and Hajongs will be settled outside Arunachal. It added that Union law minister Kiren Rijiju (who is from Arunachal) has also stated in public meetings that members of both communities will have to leave the state. “This has disturbed communal harmony, created enmity against the Chakmas and Hajongs, and also fear in the minds of Chakmas and Hajongs as to whether there is rule of law in this country or not,” the letter said. Alleging racial profiling and discrimination, it added that despite two Supreme Court orders in 1996 and 2015, not a single one of the nearly 15,000 Chakmas/Hajongs who migrated in 1964 have been granted Indian citizenship. It mentioned that descendants of those migrants who are citizens of India by birth have not been included in voter lists in Arunachal. “Chakmas and Hajongs totally and wholly reject any attempt to settle them outside the state,” the letter stated. It mentioned that there is a likelihood of Chakmas and Hajongs of Arunachal getting relocated to Assam. In a press release issued on Monday, Chakma Rights and Development Organisation (CRDO) also opposed the relocation move and instead asked the Centre to create a separate Union territory for Chakmas and Hajongs in the areas of Arunachal where they are settled at present. “It hurts us badly when after 57 years of rehabilitation we are branded as ‘refugees’ by none other than the CM himself. We were ‘refugees’ at one point, long ago before the resettlement in NEFA but are like any other citizens of the country now,” the release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chakma-groups-reject-proposed-relocation-move-from-arunachal-pradesh-write-to-pm-modi-101629740848589.html

23-08-2021||Mumbai||No unusual rise in Delta Plus cases in districts of concern in Maharashtra: Health officials||Although cases of Delta Plus variants have increased to 103 from 21 in June in the state, public health officials claim that transmission rate is still limited. Most districts which recorded the variant have lower positivity rate than the state’s average that stands at 3.1%. Swab samples from Maharashtra continue to be sent for genome sequencing to Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) to detect mutations in Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.“The identification of mutations from swab samples is a continuous process. Every month, we send around 3,600 samples for genome sequencing, and it takes over a month to get the reports. So far, almost 90% of them have tested positive for Delta variants,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer.Delta Plus (AY.1) is a mutation of the highly transmissible Delta variant of Sars-CoV-2 (B.1.617.2) and detected in the state during the second wave. In June, the Union health ministry declared it as the variant of concern.In June 21 Delta Plus variants were identified in the state, which raised fear among the medical experts. Districts like Ratnagiri, Kolhapur, Mumbai, Beed, Raigad, among others became a cause of concern for the state health department. However, almost after three months, it has been observed that there hasn’t been any unusual rise in Covid-19 cases in the districts that reported Delta Plus variants. For instance, Ratnagiri that has recorded 15 cases of Delta Plus variant so far, the highest in the state, is recording fewer daily Covid-19 cases compared to July. The seven-day positivity rate of the district stands at 2.6%. Similarly, Mumbai which recorded 11 Delta Plus cases is recording a positivity rate below 1% since last month.In Ratnagiri, Dr Sanghamitra Gawde, civil surgeon said, “We are keeping a close eye and testing more people and close contacts of Covid-19 patients, but we haven’t recorded any sudden rise in cases. We have only 1,400 active Covid-19 cases which was around 2,000 at the start of the month.”Till date, there is little evidence to show that Delta plus is as transmissible as the Delta variant, which continues to be the dominant variant across the globe.“We need more data before concluding if Delta Plus is more transmissible than the Delta variant. So far, we haven’t observed any significant rise in Covid-19 cases in these districts. Now, as the Covid-19 restrictions have been relaxed, the next 3-4 weeks will be crucial,” said Dr Awate.SK Singh, director of the National Centre for Disease Control, in a press briefing last week on the pandemic status in India, said, “From the evidence we have so far, it looks like the Delta Plus variant of the novel coronavirus will not be able to fuel an exponential surge in the number of Covid cases in India.”Experts also point out that Delta plus variant has also been found in nine other countries — the USA, UK, Portugal, Switzerland, Japan, Poland, Nepal, Russia and China. The Delta variant has now spread to 80 countries.“The concern now is that the presence of the mutation in the delta plus variant might render it immune from the antibodies produced by the vaccine, past infection or the new antibody cocktails being used in treatment. However, this hasn’t yet been proven and might not necessarily be the case, and the rarity with which the delta plus variant has been reported makes it not a variant of concern yet. We do need to be vigilant and monitor its spread closely,” said Dr Lancelot Pinto, pulmonologist and epidemiologist from Hinduja Hospital. However, some districts like Pune, Sangli, Satara and Ahmedabad that are recording above 4.5% weekly positivity rate are the main concern of the state health department. “There still are some districts of concern across Maharashtra. There are several factors behind it. Some of these districts peaked late, so are experiencing a thick tail. We need to keep up with contact tracing and ring fence those areas where the clusters are seen so that we are able to isolate and treat these patients better,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, part of the state Covid-19 task force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-unusual-rise-in-delta-plus-cases-in-districts-of-concern-in-maharashtra-health-officials-101629740427758.html

The accused, Johnson Victor Batiste, 42, and Mohammed Afzal, 33, had allegedly been planning the murder since July and did a reccee of the shop where Jain worked alone, said deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Mahesh Patil.The accused managed to flee with 2 kgs of silver jewellery as Jain refused to hand over the keys of two safes where around 4 kgs of gold worth ₹2 crore was stored. Batiste is from Ahmedabad and lived in Pragati Nagar, Nallasopara (East) while Afzal hailed from Kolkata and resided in Bhayander. One of the accused had a criminal history and was held for robbery in Bandra and Juhu, said the officer. Both the accused allegedly lost their jobs during lockdown and hence came up with a plan to rob the jewellery store. On the day of the incident, the duo allegedly reached the shop around 9am but launched an attach at 11am when Jain was busy with sweeping the shop and performing prayer. The duo tied Jain down and looted the shop. They then stabbed him several times before fleeing, said Patil. “We formed 15 teams and deployed around 90 personnel, and on Monday we arrested the duo under sections 302 (murder) and 397 (robbery or dacoity with attempt to kill) of the Indian Penal Code. Both the accused have been remanded in police custody for a week. The police, however, are yet to recover the stolen silver,” said Patil.The accused had allegedly used a gun and a fake gun, however, they stabbed the victim to avoid the sound. Goldsmiths, jewellers and shopkeepers kept their shops closed as a protest and wanted the killers to be arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nallasopara-jeweller-murder-accused-duo-held-within-48-hours-101629740127541.html

For example, as per the provision, only where construction took place on more than 50 per cent of plots before March 31, 2015 qualified to be considered under the Act. Since such deficient areas and their coming into being is an ongoing process, this provision presented hardship in certain cases.

23-08-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad civic body okays ₹40 crore for upgrading drainage infra||The Ghaziabad municipal corporation on Monday decided to spend about ₹40 crore on upgrading the drainage infrastructure in the city. The move comes after major city roads witnessed heavy traffic jams due to waterlogging following heavy rains in the last two days. “As we faced waterlogging issues over the weekend, we have decided to improve the drainage system at five key points, including at Nandgram and Brij Vihar, among other areas. For this, we have approved a fund of about ₹40 crore, and it will be spent after the final approval from the state government,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner. Even the light rainfall on Monday resulted in traffic jams on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway stretch at Lal Kuan, which is witnessing the construction of a 16-lane rail over bridge (ROB) near ABES College.The corporation on Saturday deployed 39 officers at 13 worst-affected areas for round the clock monitoring and resolving the waterlogging issues. “Our teams have worked round the clock and sorted out the waterlogging issues that occurred due to heavy downpour. The drainage system fell short to drain out the high water volume. The teams are still deployed and there have been no major complaints now,” said Tanwar. The 13 worst-affected areas include New Bus Adda to Patel Nagar, Gandhi Nagar, Nehru Nagar, Ramte Ram Road, old bus stand, Navyug Market, Lohiya Nagar, Seemant Vihar (Kaushambi), Brij Vihar, Mohan Nagar, Apsara Border, Rajendra Nagar, Pandav Nagar, Karpuripuram and Govindpuram, among others. Meanwhile, councillors said that the drainage system needs to be revamped. “Most of the areas in the city witnessed heavy waterlogging after the rains in the past three days. This raises questions about the effectiveness of cleaning of drains before the monsoon. It shows that the city is not prepared for heavy monsoon rains. People got stuck up for hours in traffic jams due to waterlogging on roads,” said Rajendra Tyagi, councillor from Raj Nagar. “Further, in many residential areas, residents have covered drains. It has reduced the handling capacity of drains,” he added.Environmentalists said that massive concretisation has led to the situation. “There has been heavy reliance on putting up tiles on roadsides which doesn’t allow rainwater to seep into ground. Further, the rainwater harvesting units are merely operational on paper. This is the time when officials need serious thinking about these issues, as the city is ill-prepared to tackle heavy monsoon rains,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist.Officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said that the ROB at the Delhi-Meerut Expressway will have six new lanes added by August 30. “The load testing has been completed and signages are being put up. Opening of new lanes will ease out traffic pressure,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-civic-body-okays-40-crore-for-upgrading-drainage-infra-101629739826913.html
23-08-2021||Noida||Noida: Construction work begins at international airport site in Jewar||The construction work on the Noida international airport project started on Monday in Gautam Budh Nagar’s Jewar area.The airport is proposed to come up on 1,334 hectares over the next four years under phase 1 of the project. The Yamuna International Airport Private Limited (YIAPL), the special purpose vehicle created for developing the airport, confirmed the development.“We have commenced preparatory work at the construction site of the airport after getting approvals from all the relevant authorities. We are also thankful to the UP government in providing us full support to expedite work at the airport site,” read a statement from YIAPL, which is a fully-owned subsidiary of Zurich Airport International, the Swiss company that won the rights to develop the project last year.According to officials, the first phase of the airport will have a capacity to serve 12 million passengers a year.On Monday, the company began levelling the field that was once agricultural land, said Arun Vir Singh, the chief executive officer (CEO) of Noida International Airport Limited (Nial), which is the Uttar Pradesh government’s nodal agency to implement the mega project. “We allowed the company to construct a boundary wall at the site. Gradually the construction of site office and an air traffic control building too will start,” said Singh. Nial has on its board the Uttar Pradesh government, Noida Authority, the Greater Noida Authority and the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida).Singh said phase 1 of the project is scheduled to be completed in 36 months. “The phase 1 the includes 1,334 hectare of land and will commence operations with one runway. Later, more runways will be added. In each phase, the airport will expand to serve 70 million passengers by the end of phase 4, subject to passenger growth and traffic,” he added.There will be two runways in phase 1. By the end of phase 4, the airport is projected to have five runways and over 5,000 hectares.Singh said YIAPL had secured ₹3,725 crore loan from the State Bank of India (SBI) earlier this month. “This amount has now been disbursed to the company for the construction of the airport,” he said.A formal foundation stone laying ceremony will also be held at the airport site soon and is likely to be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath.“All preparations for the ceremony are done and it will be held as soon as we get a final confirmation from the Prime Minister’s office on the date,” said Dhirendra Singh, Jewar MLA.Gautam Budh Nagar District Magistrate Suhas LY said the commencement of construction of the airpor was a matter of pride for the district.“This has only been possible because of the support of nearly 9,000 farmers and local residents who gave their land for the mega project. In fact, their rehabilitation was probably the largest in the country. Generally, land becomes a major bone of contention in such big projects, but the people have been supportive,” said Suhas.Officials said the land for first phase has been acquired from villages Ranhera, Rohi, Parohi, Kishorpur, Dayanatpur and Banwaribas in Jewar sub-division of GB Nagar.The airport is billed to be the largest in India upon completion and will be the National Capital Region’s third, after the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) and Ghaziabad’s Hindon airport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-construction-work-begins-at-international-airport-site-in-jewar-101629739706788.html
23-08-2021||Mumbai||Body in gunny bag behind Inorbit Mall: Youth murdered 70-year-old for resisting rape||The body found in a gunny bag behind Inorbit Mall, suspected to be of a woman, has been identified as a 70-year-old from Govandi. She was killed by a 26-year-old man when she resisted his attempt to rape her. The body of the deceased, identified as Bababbai Shantibai Kamble, was found in a gunny bag on August 2. Investigations revealed that she was killed on the night of July 29. She was stabbed on her neck with a bottle and then hit on her head with a stone. Apart from the tattoo on the wrist of the deceased, the police had no primary clue. “While we looked for the missing person’s complaint in police stations in Mumbai, we found one of a 70-year-old lady with the description of a similar tattoo. The family of the missing lady was asked to identify the body,” Pramod Toradmal, inspector from Vashi police station, said. Police interrogated around 250 people and examined around 350 CCTV footage and found the footage of the woman going towards Inorbit Mall with an unidentified man on the day of the incident. “Using the sketch of the accused made with the help of CCTV footage, he was nabbed. To hide his identity, the accused had cut his hair and threw away his bag that was seen in the footage,” said assistant police inspector Sachin Dhage. “The accused is a homeless man who usually slept under the Sanpada bridge and loitered around railway stations. On July 29, the deceased lost her way to home in Govandi and ended up reaching Vashi, wherein the accused saw her. On the pretext of giving her food to eat, he asked her to accompany him. He took her to an isolated area under the flyover behind Inorbit Mall and tried to sexually abuse her. When she resisted, the accused stabbed her on her neck with a broken glass bottle lying nearby, hit her head with a stone and then dumped the body in a gunny bag lying in the garbage bin,” Ramesh Chavan, senior police inspector from Vashi police station, said. The accused was arrested on Sunday from Vashi station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/body-in-gunny-bag-behind-inorbit-mall-youth-murdered-70-year-old-for-resisting-rape-101629739706320.html
23-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: FYJC registrations dip by 40,000 this year||Registration figures for the ongoing first-year junior college (FYJC) admissions shows a 40,000 drop this year compared to 2020. Data released by the office of deputy director of education (DyDE) on Monday shows that nearly 2.02 lakh FYJC aspirants completed the registration process this year compared to 2.42 lakh in 2020. This dip has surprised many, especially since a higher number of students cleared Class 10 across school education boards this year.Registered figures have highlighted a dip in applications from students across boards but the biggest drop in applications has come from state board students. Last year nearly 2.21 lakh SSC students had registered for FYJC admissions, but this year the figure stood at 1.83 lakh. Similarly 10,050, 6,363 and 1,220 applications from ICSE, CBSE and IGCSE students were been recorded this year. Last year these figures stood at 11,110, 7,708 and 1,300, respectively.“Every year we get a huge chunk of applications for science stream when we conduct in-house quota, management quota and minority quota admissions, but this year overall applications seem to have dipped, and it shows during admissions,” said Marie Fernandes, principal of St Andrew’s College Bandra. While the general (common) admission rounds will begin from August 27, minority colleges are finishing admissions to minority, management and in-house quota seats currently.This year, Class 10 board exams across several school education boards were scrapped due to rising Covid-19 cases. Results for the Class 10 batch was instead based on students’ performance in class 9 and 10 combined. This decision helped boost marks of students across school education boards. While the overall success rate of Secondary School Certificate (SSC) students was 99.5% this year, ICSE student in Maharashtra and CBSE students from the Pune region (which includes Mumbai) boasted of a 100% success rate.Colleges are still unsure about reasons for the dip in applications, but some fear this could be because of a large number of families that left Mumbai during lockdown and moved back to their hometowns after losing jobs in the city. “This is a worrying trend because it could either mean students who left the city due to financial constraints have now decided to pursue education in their native towns or worse, are dropping out of higher education due to family problems. The government should be studying these figures and finding out why less number of students are applying for junior college admissions,” said the principal of a college in Andheri. She added that many students from neighbouring states would have also decided to pursue education in their home states this year due to virtual classes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-fyjc-registrations-dip-by-40-000-this-year-101629739526408.html

As per officials at the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the districts of Keonjhar, Boudh, Angul, Jajpur, and Bhadrak have recorded a severe deficit rainfall (shortfall of 39 to 59 per cent) during June 1 and August 23 while another 20 districts witnessed deficit rainfall (shortfall of 19 to 39 per cent).Not a single district in Odisha recorded a surplus rainfall till now. However, 29 of the 314 blocks in the state are facing a drought-like situation as the land is losing its moisture due to scanty rainfall.Chief secretary Suresh Mohapatra who chaired a review meeting of the agriculture and water resources department said though the state is yet to see a drought-like situation, moisture-stress conditions persist.“The officials in the districts have been asked to emphasize three aspects. We have to make the best use of the existing irrigation projects. Agricultural workers will be provided jobs under MGNREGA or other state schemes if necessary. While 10 lakh person days of work has been generated so far, 20 lakh more person days of work would be created. All the irrigation facilities have to be kept running and uninterrupted power supply should be provided to all irrigation and water supply facilities. Besides, immediate power connection should be provided to newly set up lift irrigation points and borewells,” he said.Agricultural department officials said though good rain in August was crucial for the sowed crops to grow up, Odisha received 50 percent less rainfall in August this year in comparison to last year. While paddy sowing this Kharif is down by nearly 6 lakh hectares, the total crop coverage, including Kharif pulses, cotton etc, has declined by nearly 7 lakh hectares.“An IMD report said most districts in Odisha recorded negative Standardised Precipitation Index values during the period from June 1 to August 21. Negative SPI reveals a dip in soil moisture. “If the condition persists for a few more days, it would be difficult to save the crops,” said a senior official in the state agriculture department.However, the opposition accused the government of not taking the situation seriously. “The government should immediately convene a meeting of natural disaster management committee and all party meet should also be called to discuss steps to combat drought,” said Ganeswar Behera, a Congress spokesperson. The BJP, meanwhile, decided to send 4 teams to visit drought-hit districts.Though officially drought is yet to be declared, last week, the Sambalpur zilla parishad passed a resolution demanding that the district be declared drought-hit. In Ganjam district, villagers are catching frogs from the locality, bathing them with turmeric water and smearing vermilion on their bodies hoping that the ritual would bring rains.Odisha had last experienced drought in 2018 in nine districts of the state, most of them from western Odisha where farmers suffered crop loss of 33 percent and above due to moisture stress in the districts. In 2015, at least 25 of the 30 district had experienced drought due to an erratic southwest monsoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/with-30-deficient-rainfall-odisha-asks-all-collectors-to-make-contingency-plans-101629738446373.html

A single-judge bench of Justice Rajesh Singh Chauhan observed on August 12: “A member of a disciplined force must strictly follow the executive orders or circulars or instructions issued by the department or by the higher authority of the department as those executive orders etc. are as good as service conditions.” The court dismissed a petition filed by Mohammad Farman, a constable who was posted at the Khandasa police station in Ayodhya and had refused to cut his beard despite being issued orders by the station house officer. Superintendent of police (Rural), Ayodhya, had also rejected Farman’s application seeking permission to keep his beard. Constable Mohammad Farman was suspended on November 5, 2020, and issued a charge sheet on July 29 this year. He had challenged his suspension order and the charge sheet before the high court. “As a matter of fact such executive intimation/order has been issued to maintain the discipline in the force directing to keep the appearance and uniform befitting for the members of disciplined force,” the court added. “Further, police force has to be a disciplined force and being a law enforcing agency, it is necessary that such force must have secular image which strengthen the countenance of national integration,” the court observed. “Therefore, non-cutting the beard despite making the petitioner aware by the In-charge Station House Officer of police station Khandasa (Ayodhya) when the petitioner was posted as constable to the effect that the police personnel may not have beard as it is a violation of direction/circular being issued by the higher officials is not only a wrong behaviour but the same is misdemeanour, misdeed and delinquency of the petitioner,” the court observed. “I hereby dismiss the writ petition being misconceived and direct the inquiry officer to conduct and conclude the inquiry against the petitioner in a manner directed above and the disciplinary authority may pass final order strictly as per law,” ordered the court.

A proposal to that effect has been put forward before the standing committee.Earlier too, the PMC had put forth a proposal before the state government asking to help private citizens construct compound walls that had been damaged by inundation of the Ambil odha. However, the proposal did not get a nod and owners of private bungalows went ahead with constructing the retaining walls on their own except for some old housing societies which did not have the necessary funds. At the time, the political leadership was willing to help private citizens and mayor Murlidhar Mohol announced it several times but the plan did not go through as there was no provision to help private societies.Meanwhile, some civic officials who did not wish to be identified said that three months into the rainy season and works on the Ambil odha were still not complete due to delay in the tendering and work order process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-wants-rs11-96-crore-for-retaining-wall-on-civic-properties-along-ambil-odha-101629737485592.html

This includes residents travelling from Katraj, Upper Indiranagar, Sinhgad road, Dhayari and Katraj. “I used to take a direct bus from Katraj bus stand to Deccan Gymkhana, but this has now been canceled. I need to change two buses from Katraj to Swargate and then from Swargate to Deccan. I was told that to travel within the city there is this Atal bus service. Though it is beneficial to travel within the peth areas, it is not useful for passengers traveling from outer parts of Pune,” said Shalaka Pethe, an officergoer and resident of Katraj. Daily commuter Prasad Harshe said, “The bus from Dhayari to Shanipar bus stand has been canceled and I need to board two buses to reach my shop. I work as a salesman and cannot afford to go by bike due to increased fuel prices. The direct bus is not running any more.”Last month, PMPML had launched a city bus service called Atal “Dus mein Bus” bus service under which passengers can travel within the city for ₹10. PMPML traffic manager Dattatray Zhende said, “As the bus routes from suburban areas are cut down, traffic congestion within the city has reduced. Though we have cancelled long-route buses, there is five-minute frequency between buses, to travel anywhere within the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmpml-cuts-down-on-long-routes-forcing-suburban-passengers-to-change-buses-enroute-to-city-101629736885622.html

He was earlier lodged at the Bhagalpur Central Jail and was shifted to the open jail at Buxar in 2020. A search has been launched,” said a prison official, on condition of anonymity.The open jail concept has been introduced in 13 states of the country to encourage good conduct and self-discipline among inmates. As per Bihar Jail Manual 2008, well-behaved life term convicts over 30 years of age and belonging to the state, are eligible to be considered for open jail after spending 10 years behind bars, among other criteria. Inmates convicted either for planned mass murder, murder of a public servant, or under the National Security Act, or court-martialed, aren’t considered for open jail. The Buxar open jail was inaugurated in 2012 and it currently accommodates 50 inmates, along with their dependents. According to the FIR lodged by prison authorities, Sahni, who was staying in the open jail with his wife, slipped away after gaining permission to go to the Sadar Hospital on Sunday morning. “Around 6.10 am, he left for the hospital for treatment, but did not return till 6pm,” said Dinesh Kumar Malakar, the station house officer (SHO) of the town police station. He said a police team has been dispatched for Bhagalpur to search him.A senior prison official said this was perhaps the first instance of a prisoner escaping from the open jail in Bihar. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/murder-convict-escapes-from-open-jail-in-buxar-101629736347638.html

23-08-2021||Patna||Rural governance in Bihar: Panchayati raj officers now CEOs of panchayat samities||In a new arrangement to run Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI) set-up in Bihar, the state government on Monday notified the block panchayati raj officers as the new executive officers (CEO) of panchayat samities, replacing the block development officers (BDOs). Panchayati Raj minister Samrat Chaudhary said the systematic change was brought in conformity with the recent amendments to the Bihar Panchayati Raj Act during the just concluded monsoon session of the state legislature. The panchayati raj department has also ordered a freeze on all sorts of spending by panchayat samities from Tuesday till the new bodies are elected. “The ban on spending has been imposed in view of the election code of conduct, which comes into force from August 24 when the state election commission formally notifies the elections,” said Chaudhary. Panchayat polls in Bihar are scheduled in 11 phases beginning September 24. The minister said expenditure under the ongoing Har ghar nal ka jal scheme, however, had been exempted from the ban. There are 534 panchayat samities, one in each block, in the state. Amrit Lal Meena, additional chief secretary at the panchayati raj department, said the new arrangement in the PRIs was mooted after it was observed that the BDOs were unable to spare sufficient time for monitoring working of rural bodies. “Panchayat samities are likely to receive huge grants from the Centre and the state government for developmental activities in the next five years,” Meena said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/rural-governance-in-bihar-panchayati-raj-officers-now-ceos-of-panchayat-samities-101629736293268.html
23-08-2021||Patna||BJP a divided house on caste census||The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), which was part of an all-party delegation from Bihar which met the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday to press for a caste census in the country, seems to be a divided house on the issue. While several BJP leaders are against the caste census, a few others have supported it.State’s minister Janak Ram, who was part of the delegation from the BJP side, was cautious. “The PM has to take a decision on the caste census demand. Whatever he decides should be acceptable to all parties,” Ram said after the meeting in New Delhi. “PM has proved that development and caste are two different things. I don’t think caste creates hindrances in development,” he told reporters. Others like minister Ram Surat Rai backed caste census categorically. “Both caste census and a law on population control are necessary. The mandate lies with the Centre. It is good that chief minister Nitish Kumar and PM Modi met on the issue,” Rai said. Patliputra BJP MP Ram Kripal Yadav, a former union minister, said BJP “has been ahead of others when it comes to safeguarding the rights of OBCs”.Cooperative minister Subhash Singh, however, is opposed to the idea. “This will lead to social tension,” he had said. While deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad gave no reaction, Bihar BJP chief Dr Sanjay Jaiswal had recently said a caste census might have an adverse impact on social amity. When reached for comment on Monday, he said, “Whatever PM decides will be acceptable to us.” Most BJP leaders had opposed caste census after the Union government ruled out demand for the same in Parliament. “However, they seem to have realized suddenly it would not like to be seen as the isolated party which is opposing caste census,” said Gyanendra Yadav, associate professor and head of sociology department, College of Commerce, Patna. The most explicit support for a caste census has come from Rajya Sabha member and former deputy chief minister of state Sushil Kumar Modi. “BJP has never been against the caste census. That is why we have been part of the resolution passed in the Legislative Assembly and the Council on this issue. BJP is part of the delegation which met Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In the year 2011, BJP’s Gopinath Munde had presented the party’s side in Parliament in favour of the caste census,” he tweeted.The BJP heavyweight in Bihar further said that on the instructions of the central government at that time, when the socio-economic survey was conducted by the ministries of rural development and urban development, crores of errors were found in it. “The number of castes reached into lakhs. The report was not made public due to huge discrepancies,” he said. A senior BJP leader, wishing not to be named, conceded that the demand for caste census has indeed put his party in a dilemma. “BJP cannot wholeheartedly support OBC politics, unlike the JD-U and RJD, because it fears it would antagonise the upper castes. But it can also not been seen as anti-OBC because it has made inroads in the sizable OBC and Dalit vote bank in the state,” he said.The last caste census was held in India in 1931.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bjp-a-divided-house-on-caste-census-101629736292100.html

Around 600 doctors and nurses from the state health department have undergone online training through experts from Patna’s All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) so far. However, hands-on training of the shortlisted health personnel is awaited at AIIMS, as the State Health Society, Bihar, is yet to confirm the schedule. “We are in the process of finalising the framework of shortlisting health personnel to be sent for the physical training at AIIMS-Patna. We will share the schedule after we finalise it,” said a government functionary in the know of the programme. The state government has already decided in principle to nominate AIIMS-Patna as the centre of excellence for paediatrics management of Covid-19, in anticipation of the third wave of the pandemic. “We shall release the online training module for trainees tomorrow (Tuesday). Those who perform well will be shortlisted for the physical training, in consultation with the state government,” said Dr Lokesh Tiwari, additional professor and head, paediatrics department at the AIIMS-Patna. The AIIMS proposes to shortlist 125-odd health personnel for physical training. Of this, 50% will be paediatricians and 50% nurses. The shortlisted candidates will be divided into four batches and each batch will have a week-long hands-on training at the institute. “We propose to begin the week-long physical training in PICU management for each of the four batches from August 31. The training session will continue for a month. However, we are awaiting confirmation of the training schedule from the state health department,” added Dr Tiwari. The idea, he said, was to impart hands-on training in PICU management to at least two doctors and two nurses at every district hospital — there are 36 district hospitals in Bihar. These personnel, if needed, could then lead the paediatrics acute care unit at the district level. The remaining 475 health personnel, trained through online mode, would support them at the sub-divisional hospital and the community health centre levels. “We will shortlist a few among the 125 health personnel selected for the physical training, to become trainers, who can then train others at the periphery level,” added Dr Tiwari. The AIIMS sent reminders to the state health department before the online training of health personnel began on August 10. The institute imparted online training to 600 state healthcare workers (HCWs) in five days between August 10 and 18. As many as 200 paediatricians from across all the nine state-run medical colleges were trained on August 10, the first day of the online training programme, while the remaining 400 doctors and nurses from district hospitals were trained over the remaining four days on August 12, 13, 17 and 18. The AIIMS does not want the physical training of healthcare workers to be delayed any further. Bihar reported 20 new cases of SARS-CoV-2 from 10 of its 38 districts on Sunday, taking the total number of Covid-19 cases to 725,588 and deaths 9,649. The number of active cases had come down to 140, with a recovery rate of 98.63%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/handson-training-of-hcws-at-aiims-patna-awaits-state-govt-nod-101629736290838.html

Continuing the downtrend, UP has been maintaining the daily Covid test positivity rate (TPR) — the number of positive cases against the total tests done — at 0.01%, the lowest in the country. This rate was at its highest at 16.84 % on April 24 in UP and now remains even lower than the lowest post the first wave of Covid.” High number of recoveries and a low number of fresh cases subsided the active caseload in the state to 362, the statement said. None of the 75 districts reported fresh cases of coronavirus infection in double-digits lately and as many as 69 districts reported no fresh cases in the last 24 hours, whereas six reported new cases in just single digits, it said. Lucknow had reported its first Covid case on March 11, 2020.

Earlier, Meghalaya chief minister Conrad K Sangma had urged the youths to return the snatched rifles even as he promised to keep their identities secret, in other words, he offered absolute amnesty.Elaborating on the retrieval, assistant inspector general of Police (AIG-A), Gabriel K Iangrai said that the three INSAS rifles which were stolen (police refuse to acknowledge they were snatched) from the personnel on August 15 have been retrieved from Umkhrah river by the Search and Rescue Team (SRT) of the Fire and Emergency Services and the East Khasi Hills district police.On behalf of Meghalaya police, the AIG expressed its sincere gratitude to the Rangbah Shnongs (headman) of Mawlai Town Dorbar (village council) for their continuous support and to the youths who had come forward to inform the police through an anonymous letter released through the media.On August 15, a police vehicle (black Scorpio) belonging to Mawkynroh outpost was set ablaze at Jaiaw. A group of youths accosted a police posse led by the in charge of the police outpost, wrenched the assault rifles from the police personnel and commandeered the vehicle for a ride before converting it into wrangled metal by setting it aflame at Jaiaw.The incident was a mark of protest against the death of former Hynñiewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC), a proscribed militant out, founding general secretary Cherish Starfield Thangkhiew in his residence on August 13 morning in a ‘police encounter’Soon after, the incident went viral online, chief minister Conrad K Sangma urged the youths to return the rifles. “All those who are involved are asked to immediately return the weapon,” Sangma had appealed through the media, while promising that the identity and names of those involved will be kept strictly confidential as the interest of the state was to retrieve the weapons.“Since we are not very clear about the situation and the circumstances, we can’t assume that they (the miscreants) came with the intention of grabbing the weapons at this point of time. We are more concerned about the safety of the people,” Sangma stated. Meanwhile, the four policemen have been suspended and an inquiry has been initiated against them for “deserting their weapons”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rifles-snatched-from-police-by-youths-recovered-from-stream-in-shillong-101629734666153.html
23-08-2021||Other||Agharkar Research Institute, Sentient Labs develop technology generating hydrogen directly from agri residue||PUNE: The MACS-Agharkar Research Institute (ARI) along with Sentient Labs, a research and development innovation laboratory incubated by KPIT Technologies, has developed the world’s first technology that generates hydrogen directly from agricultural residue for use in fuel cell-powered vehicles.The hydrogen generation technology uses agricultural residue rich in cellulose and hemicellulose content – in the likes of paddy, wheat, or maize residue. The process uses microbial culture for the direct generation of hydrogen from agricultural residues. It further generates methane, which is utilised for producing additional hydrogen by steam methane reformation. This process can avoid the burning of bio-mass generated in large measure in the Indian countryside and generate organic manure and CO2 that find application in various industries.Dr Dhakephalkar, director of ARI, said on the occasion, “Hydrogen fuel cell vehicle technology is billed as the next big step in the direction of sustainable mobility as it provides a large operating range, is suitable for commercial vehicles, and leaves a minimal environmental footprint. The need of the hour in crude oil-importing nations is to rapidly move towards self-reliant energy sources and sustainable mobility. The hydrogen generated from this technology will be utilised to power fuel cell vehicles that emit only water, thus making the entire cycle pollution-free.”The vision is to build technology solutions for the electrification of mobility. The bottlenecks in battery technology, fuel cell technology and technology for hydrogen generation have been identified and multiple efforts are underway to create the building blocks required for sustainable mobility.Dr Dhakephalkar said, “Our technology is 25% more efficient as compared to conventional anaerobic digestion processes used today. The innovative two-stage process eliminates the pre-treatment of the biomass, thus making the process economical and environmentally-friendly. This biologically benign process generates digestate rich in nutrients which can be used as organic fertiliser. Its byproducts can be used as soil conditioners while undigested solids for briquetting that can be sold as solid fuel. I thank the scientists and engineers at Agharkar Research Institute and Sentient Labs for this achievement.”While Ravi Pandit, chairman of Sentient Labs, said, “We incubated Sentient Labs to work on technology research and development projects related to mobility and energy. This innovation affirms our commitment to mission hydrogen and the ‘Make in India’ charter by the government. This breakthrough of generating hydrogen from unutilised agricultural residue will help us become self-reliant in terms of energy resources.

23-08-2021||Chandigarh||Cong MLA claims water shortage in Bhiwani villages, Khattar orders probe||Following senior Congress leader Kiran Choudhry said in the assembly on Monday that people of Bhiwani districts have been facing “acute water scarcity for the past three months”, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar ordered an inquiry to be completed within 24 hours to “ascertain” the reality. In her calling attention notice during the second sitting of the monsoon session of the Vidhan Sabha, the Congress leader Choudhry, who represents Tosham assembly segment of Bhiwani district, said all the villagers of her district have been spending ₹500 to ₹800 daily on water tankers for drinking water. Giving an instance, she claimed in Umravat village people got water on four occasions in six months. “People have been forced to buy the drinking water at a very high rate,” she told the House, evoking strong reaction from agriculture minister JP Dalal, who also comes from Bhiwani district. As the Congress MLA dwelt at length on how people have been reeling under water scarcity in Bhiwani and tried to corner the treasury benches, chief minister interjected and launched the counter offensive. Assuring appropriate action, Khattar announced that an inquiry will be done within 24 hours into the issues Congress leader has raised. He said if the issue raised turns out contrary to the ground realities, appropriate proceedings should be initiated against the MLA for misleading the House. Later, in a release, the government said the committee headed by additional chief secretary (ACS-irrigation and water resources) Devender Singh will be constituted to conduct an inquiry into water shortage in Bhiwani district. The spokesperson said the committee will submit its reports within 24 hours. “The chief minister said that action would be taken against the officers of the department if the statement made by Kiran Choudhry turns out to be true. The report in this regard will be presented to the speaker. The report will make it clear who is misleading the House,” said an official spokesperson, quoting chief minister Khattar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-mla-claims-water-shortage-in-bhiwani-villages-khattar-orders-probe-101629734065445.html

Gautam Sonowal alias Girin Sonowal (50) was arrested on Sunday night from Tengakhat area of the district where he was hiding in an acquaintance’s house. He was produced in court on Monday and remanded to four days of police custody. Another accused, Samar Pal, an associate of Sonowal, had been arrested last week when he was about to leave for Kolkata with three prospective kidney ‘donors’. He is at present in judicial custody. “We had registered a case in Lahowal police station in July this year following a complaint from a person who had sold one of his kidneys in April,” said Bitul Chetia, additional superintendent of police, Dibrugarh. The complainant, Ramu Karmakar, had mentioned that Sonowal had convinced him to sell his kidney for a sum of ₹3.5 lakhs, which was to be transplanted to a doctor. Investigations revealed that Sonowal had received ₹13 lakhs from the doctor but paid only a fraction of it to Karmakar. Buying and selling of kidneys and other human organs is prohibited in India by the Transplantation of Human Organs Act. However, they can be transplanted from donors (who are close relatives of the patient or non-related persons after proper authorization by the government) and from brain-dead patients. Sometimes this provision in the law is used by criminals to lure poor and needy persons to ‘donate’ their kidneys with the promise of large sums of money. “Sonowal told us that he had donated one of his kidneys to a relative around five years ago in Kolkata. During that trip he came in contact with the illegal kidney transplant racket and started luring poor tea garden workers to sell their kidneys to those in need,” said Chetia. “He has confessed to having taken three people in the past two years to Kolkata to sell their kidneys. Sonowal used to take large sums from the kidney recipients but paid only a part of it to the so-called donors,” he added. The kidney racket in Dibrugarh was the second one that came to light in July this year. Forced by poverty and health complications, nearly a dozen villagers in central Assam’s Morigaon district sold their kidneys to another organised gang of criminals in recent years. The racket came to light when Lilimai Bodo, the alleged mastermind, was nabbed by the villagers in July when she visited them looking for more ‘donors’. Bodo’s son and another person, both involved in the racket, were also arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/alleged-kidney-racket-mastermind-arrested-in-assam-101629733406795.html
23-08-2021||Chandigarh||Deaths due to oxygen shortage: Congress slams CM for ‘misleading’ the House||Accusing chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar of misleading the state assembly on the issue of deaths due to shortage of oxygen, the opposition Congress MLAs on Monday demanded a high-level inquiry into the matter. The Congress MLAs later staged a walkout after their pleas to have a discussion on the three farm laws were rejected by the speaker on the grounds that the matter was sub-judice. Raising the issue of deaths due to oxygen shortage, leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda attacked Khattar during the zero-hour saying that the chief minister should withdraw his Friday statement that there were no deaths due to shortage of oxygen in the state. “I am not blaming anyone. But my point is that how can a misleading statement on the floor of the House be made. Just think of those who perished due to shortage of oxygen during the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Will this denial do any good for the departed souls,’’ Hooda said. When the chief minister said he will make a statement on the issue on Tuesday, the leader of the opposition said that Khattar should either withdraw his previous statement or assert that it was correct. When speaker Gian Chand Gupta told Hooda that a reply cannot be given by the government during zero hour, the leader of opposition said: “I do not want a reply. But I want this to be recorded that the chief minister made a wrong statement on the floor of the House.” The chief minister later assured the House that a committee will be formed to investigate complaints received against hospitals for showing negligence in giving required treatment during the pandemic and strict action will be taken. Khattar said that irregularities were reported in the functioning of certain hospitals of Hisar, Rewari and Gurugram districts and magisterial inquiries were conducted for all such complaints received. “As per the findings of the inquiries, no deaths were reported from Rewari and Gurugram hospitals due to shortage of oxygen. However, negligence by Soni Burns hospital in Hisar was detected during an inquiry. The probe report has been sent to the Hisar superintendent of police for action,’’ Khattar said. The Chief Minister said that some hospitals admitted more patients than their capacity during the peak of the second wave of the pandemic. “In Hisar’s Soni Burns Hospital where the matter of negligence came to light, the consumption had reached 80 cylinders per day while the number of cylinders available with the hospital was 20,” Khattar said. The CM also informed the House that about 13,000 people died due to Covid-19 in hospitals across the state. Of these, about 9,500 were residents of Haryana, while about 3,500 were patients from other states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/deaths-due-to-oxygen-shortage-congress-slams-cm-for-misleading-the-house-101629732326345.html

On paper, it is an hospital meant for tertiary health care (of the highest order) and is the only super specialty hospital in the Malwa region.The ongoing civil construction and relaying of roads and sewerage system meant that the woes of patients and their attendants have compounded. Water drainage outlets at the hospital remained clogged for over three days.“Not only for patients, it has become an herculean task for the doctors and para medical staff to move from one department to another. This situation is pathetic,” a resident doctor said.Gurdhian Singh, who visited the hospital on Monday, said, “Water-logging is the most severe in the main emergency and the gynae ward; people are wading through knee-deep water.”“The staff had created a temporary path by laying bricks on the corners of the waterlogged area. The stagnant water in the hospital premise is now stinking,” he added. Another resident Baljit Singh said, “People have to move patients on wheel chairs or stretchers through rain water to get their X-ray or CT scan done.”Hospital medical superintendent Dr HS Rekhi said the process of laying down water drainage pipes is on. “The water-logging is result of ongoing construction work. Once, the drainage pipes are laid, the roads will be re-carpeted. The issue will be resolved on priory basis,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/waterlogged-rajindra-hospital-signals-ailing-administration-101629731905773.html

Rawat’s comments come in the backdrop of Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu’s advisor posting a sketch of the former Prime Minister on social media.“She was one of the most popular leaders and a mother figure to us. If something insulting was said about her, we will condemn it and if it is proven during collection of info then action will be taken,” Rawat was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Rawat also clarified that the party strictly maintains that Jammu & Kashmir is an integral part of India.“Nobody has the right to cast a doubt on that status, let alone issuing a statement,” Rawat said. He however said that there is a possibility that the statements made by Sidhu’s advisors were twisted ahead of the polls which will be held in Punjab next year.Controversy erupted after Sidhu's advisors Malvinder Singh Mali and Pyare Lal Garg made remarks regarding the revocation of Article 370 and Article 35A in Kashmir and Pakistan respectively to which Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh took exception. He also asked the newly-appointed Punjab Congress to ‘rein’ in his advisors. “The atrocious and ill-conceived comments were potentially dangerous to the peace and stability of the state and the country,” Singh said in a statement.Sidhu’s advisor Malvinder Singh Mali however told news agency ANI that the posts made in social media were ‘final’. “Whatever I had to say, I've said on social media, and that is final. If anyone makes a mistake, they should reflect. We must continue to work for the welfare of Punjab,” Mali, who called Kashmir a country of the Kashmiri people, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Garg and Mali were both summoned by Sidhu after their comments led to widespread criticism from the BJP, Shiromani Akali Dal and even from leaders within the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/action-will-be-taken-if-something-insulting-was-said-uttarakhand-ex-cm-rawat-101629725213348.html

It is a review meeting and obviously, the power-sharing formula will be discussed. Singh Deo and Baghel both will be present in the meeting,” said a leader close to Baghel. The tension between Baghel and Singh Deo started brewing after June 17, the day when the CM completed two and half years of his post. The CM’s post-sharing formula has been the talking point in Chhattisgarh’s political circle after Congress came to power in December 2018 when Baghel and his two senior cabinet colleagues, Singh Deo and Tamradhwaj Sahu, were leading the contenders for the top post. Since then, speculations were rife that consensus was built for the top post based on a two-and-a-half-year power-sharing formula between Baghel and Singh Deo. In response to the near-constant speculation, both leaders have taken the stance that decisions will be taken by the high command, and they will follow the instructions from Delhi. Singh Deo, when asked about the meeting in Delhi on Tuesday, said, “You should ask Punia ji (PL Punia), he is the correct person to provide more details.” Punia was unavailable for a comment even after repeated phone calls. Earlier this month, Singh Deo was in Delhi and also met some senior leaders in the national capital, but when asked he denied and claimed that he was on a personal visit. People within the Congress believe that Singh Deo was also continuously ignored in some of the important meetings during the Covid-19 pandemic despite him being the health minister which further escalated tension between the two leaders. “We know what is going on between Singh Deo and Baghel in Chhattisgarh. On Tuesday, a possible discussion on everything will take place in presence of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. I don’t know the sequence and timing of the meetings but both will meet the Chhattisgarh leaders and all issues, including the power-sharing formula will surely be discussed,” said a senior Congress leader in Delhi. Last week, Singh Deo wrote a letter to the commissioner of the state public relations department seeking action against a news portal that ran a story saying chief minister Baghel will resign on August 17 and attributed the information to the former. In the letter written to the department on Monday, Singh Deo demanded ‘strict action’ against the news portal saying that it is a ‘planned conspiracy’ to ‘pollute’ the political environment of the state. The issue of power-sharing between the two leaders was raised by assembly speaker and senior Congress leader Charan Das Mahant about ten days back. Mahanta said that he, along with senior leaders Baghel, Singh Deo, and home minister Tamradhwaj Sahu, played the semifinals for the CM post and the finale was in progress. “Semifinals were between four people, and only two remained. But one who wins the finals is eventually the winner. Rahul ji (Rahul Gandhi) knows all about this formula and only Delhi can give more information about it,” Mahanta added. On July 27, the differences within the party came to the fore when Singh Deo walked out of the state assembly demanding clarity from his government over allegations that the minister’s relative was involved in an alleged attack on Congress legislator Brihaspat Singh. The issue began after Singh alleged that his convoy was attacked at the behest of Singh Deo in Surguja district, which is the health minister’s assembly constituency. Later, after the intervention of PL Punia, the issue was resolved and Singh Deo returned to assembly after Singh apologised for his statements against the minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chhattisgarh-cm-baghel-singh-deo-to-meet-party-high-command-in-delhi-on-tuesday-101629724827065.html

The mandal responded positively to CMs appeal: CMO pic.twitter.com/VFa9yOzJHvDuring the meeting, state Covid-19 task force chief Dr Sanjay Oak said physical distancing cannot be maintained during Dahi Handi celebrations as people come in close contact with each other while forming human pyramids. "Face masks are of no use if they get wet in water. The Delta plus variant is spreading fast. Even if one person is infected, the entire group runs the risk of catching the COVID-19 infection," he said. He asked organisers to keep the festive spirit up by organising camps to donate blood and COVID-19 treatment equipment.Thackeray said the second wave of the pandemic was receding in some districts of Maharashtra, but peaking in some other places. "This is a window period which we have to utilise to ensure that the livelihood of people is not impacted and the economic cycle continues," he added.Speaking about protests over the restrictions, Thackeray said, "These curbs are meant for the welfare of people. Only a few people speak of protesting against these restrictions. They should rather protest against coronavirus and not against the government," he said.The BJP has demanded Dahi Handi festival be allowed to be organised under certain conditions traditionally."Those who have taken both doses of COVID-19 vaccines must be allowed to organise the traditional Dahi Handi at low heights without crowding. The festival should not be banned," BJP MLA Ashish Shelar said. Thackeray reiterated that a lockdown will have to be imposed again if the daily demand for medical oxygen crosses 750 metric tonnes in MaharashtraThe chief minister said the entire world is reeling under the pandemic which has destroyed many families and orphaned children. "Countries which have vaccinated most of their citizens are feeling the heat of a third wave of the pandemic and are locked down again," he said.The Dahi Handi festival involves communities hanging an earthen pot filled with dahi (yogurt) or other milk-based delicacies, at a convenient or difficult to reach height. Young men, boys and girls form teams, make a human pyramid and attempt to reach or break the pot. The festival enjoys a political patronisation in Maharashtra with various parties organising Dahi Handis and announcing a reward for Govindas, who break the pots.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-dahi-handi-maha-cm-thackeray-urges-mandals-to-focus-on-health-initiatives-101629721531378.html
23-08-2021||Lucknow||Tough to fill vacuum created by Kalyan Singh’s demise: Amit Shah||AGRA Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday paid tribute to former UP chief minister Kalyan Singh, terming the death of the BJP stalwart a “big loss” for the party. He said Kalyan Singh was a big leader of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and always remained active in efforts to make UP the best state of the nation. “With the death of Kalyan Singhji, the BJP has lost a stalwart. It is a big loss for the party. The void created by his death is difficult to fill for a long time,” Shah told media.The minister was at the PWD Guest House at Atrauli in Aligarh on Monday where the mortal remains of the former CM were kept to allow his supporters to pay last tributes. Shah paid tribute to the deceased and consoled his son Rajveer Singh, MP from Etah constituency. “Despite not being in active politics for long, such a huge turnout, especially of youths during the last journey of Kalyan Singh indicates the huge impact Babuji had on Uttar Pradesh. He was a big leader of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and a champion of the cause of uplift of the deprived and backward,” stated Shah. “Babuji didn’t think twice in giving up power and status of chief minister when it came to the Ram Janmabhoomi movement,” added Shah. “I spoke to Babuji (Kalyan Singh) the day when the foundation for Ram temple at Ayodhya was laid. He was pleased and said that the aim of his life was fulfilled with this,” said Shah. The home minister said working for the cause of the deprived and backward would be the real tribute to the departed leader who would always be an inspiration in this task. The mortal remains of Kalyan Singh reached Aligarh on Sunday evening and were kept at Ahilya Bai Holkar Stadium in Aligarh city. Supporters for whom Kalyan Singh was ‘Babuji’ paid tributes to the leader. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath and UP BJP president Swatantra Dev Singh accompanied the ‘yatra’ carrying the mortal remains of Kalyan Singh. The CM stayed in Aligarh after reaching the city on Sunday evening. After leaving the BJP for a short period, Kalyan Singh had won the election as an independent candidate from Etah parliamentary constituency. Currently, his son Rajveer Singh ‘Raju’ is the BJP MP from Etah. Kalyan Singh’s mortal remains were taken from the Ahilya Bai Holkar Stadium in Aligarh to the PWD guest house in Atrauli, about 20 kilometers from the city on Monday morning. The vehicle ferrying the mortal remains was decorated with flowers and garlands and was led by a fleet of cops. On the way, followers of Kalyan Singh raised slogans like ‘jab tak suraj chand rahega, Babuji ka naam rahega’. The mortal remains were kept at the guest house in Atrauli till 1pm before being taken to Narora, a town in Bulandshahr district, where an enclosure was arranged for Kalyan Singh’s last rites. During this journey, locals from Madhauli, the paternal village of Kalyan Singh, came on the road to offer floral tributes. Those who paid tributes to Kalyan Singh in Atrauli included UP governor Anandiben Patel, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, UP deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, BJP leader Jitin Prasada, ministers in state cabinet Surya Pratap Shahi, Suresh Rana and others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/tough-to-fill-vacuum-created-by-kalyan-singh-s-demise-amit-shah-101629721165104.html
23-08-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand assembly remembers senior leader Indira Hridayesh||The first day of the monsoon session in the state Assembly commenced with tributes paid to late senior Congress leader and former leader of Opposition, Indira Hridayesh on Monday in Dehradun. Legislators from both Opposition and ruling sides hailed her as a leader who rose above the “concept of ruling party vs Opposition.” Hridayesh who was the senior-most member of the House, died a few months ago from cardiac arrest in Delhi where she had gone to attend a party meeting along with other leaders. The legislators offered their tributes to her along with six other leaders including sitting MLA from Gangotri, Gopal Singh Rawat, former MLAs Bachchi Singh Rawat, Narendra Singh Bhandari, Amrish Kumar, Sri Chandra and former chief minister (CM) of Uttar Pradesh and former Governor of two states, Kalyan Singh. Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami was the first one to speak in the House to offer his tributes to Hridayesh by calling her a “leader of principles with vast knowledge of the legislative process.” “The kind of leader she was, I still can’t believe that she is no more. She was a very learned MLA from whom we learnt a lot. A leader with great oratory skills, she would always shower affection on the junior legislators and help them a lot with the various legislative working of Assembly,” said Dhami. “Her behaviour with others never changed even after rising to the ranks of a cabinet minister from an MLA.” Dhami also offered tributes to Kalyan Singh saying, “Speaking on him is like showing a lamp to sun. He was a political guru to many of us when we were in student politics in undivided Uttar Pradesh. He always worked for the welfare of the poor.” BJP MLA Madan Kaushik who is also the party state president hailed Hridayesh by terming her a leader who listened to all the leaders irrespective of the party she belonged to. “She always tried to work in coordination with the Opposition parties even when she was in the government. We would always seek her guidance whenever we faced issues in any House proceeding. She will always be an inspiration to all of us,” said Kaushik. The newly appointed leader of Opposition Pritam Singh who was attending the House for the first time after being given the responsibility by his party following Hridayesh’s demise said, “Sitting as the Leader of Opposition in her place in the House, I am feeling uneasy.” “She was such a tall personality in the state’s politics that the more is said about her, it is only less. I was fortunate enough to spend some time with her in my political career,” said Singh. He added, “There are very few leaders who would show love and affection to the junior MLAs. She was at the forefront of such MLAs. She always did politics for the development of state and never indulged in ruling vs Opposition party thing.” He said that he can’t believe that she is no more with them in the House. “With the kind of tall leader she was, the real tribute to her would be to walk on the path of principles she was onto,” said Singh. Earlier, before the House commenced, the legislators also paid their tributes to the founder of the Chipko Movement and prominent environmentalist Sunderlal Bahuguna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-assembly-remembers-senior-leader-indira-hridayesh-101629721105783.html
23-08-2021||Chandigarh||Long and short of phone calls, does it ring a bell?||It’s been over six months since my younger brother came home from Canada, where he lives. Whenever I go to his room, his mobile phone is fixed to his ear. The other day while looking at him, I was reminded of my own set of callers and was amused to recall their sheer variety. Of them, I know whose call I can take anytime, considering their to-the-point-talk norm and whose call I’ve to avoid at a certain time for the lengthy chats they always indulge in. Whenever my octogenarian grandmother calls from her village home, she disconnects the call within seconds. All she asks is if I am fine and if I’ve had my meals. As soon as my answers reach her, I hear the beep sound, never giving me or anyone who calls her up the opportunity to ask the same questions. Sometimes, I have something new to share but as I commence to unfold, the beep sound stands between us. I dial right away and protest, “I was still talking ….” But I understand, she is old. There are also those with whom you like to talk, but they can’t give up multi-tasking. Take my busy aunt for instance, who runs a clothing boutique from home. Even if she is talking to me, she continues to give instructions to her employees, sometimes scolding along. I may suggest to her that we can talk later, but she never wants to disconnect. Maninder, a friend from school, who now lives in New Zealand, amuses me, when he takes a long pause as I just finish speaking. And I have to follow up, “Hello! Are you still there?” Another pause and he replies, “Yes, I was listening, was just analysing what you just said.” Fortunately, he is not a TV news reporter. When I dial my US-based aunt, she starts sharing spiritual stories. Though I find them inspiring, as she keeps pulling them up, one after the other, it takes so long that I have to find excuses to end the call. An appointment or somebody’s at the door works. Other than this aunt, long calls take place also with my navy officer friend, whose mind carries many travel stories, and no wonder, every time we speak; we go on shuttling from one corner of the globe to the other, swapping our globetrotting experiences, besides our discussions on realisations about life through travel. Because of my zeal for travel, I can go on talking to him. Thankfully, I’m no mobile addict, as I connect even with my favourite callers after several weeks, sometimes months. Longer the gap, richer the conversations turn out. Which is why my phone often reflects missed calls, and as I return calls, I’m reprimanded too, “Why don’t you ever take your calls?” I keep my excuses ready, effortlessly flagging them, from the phone being charged in the other room to it being on silent mode. At times, I switch off as well, when I want to be 100% present somewhere. Therefore, cell phone addicts surprise me, who don’t spare the mobile, even while driving, dining, meeting someone or in the toilet. There are also those, who don’t mind talking over the phone loud and clear, sharing all their personal tales and details even at public places. I don’t deny the plethora of benefits of mobiles, but addiction is a concern. A WhatsApp message sent recently by a friend makes for a perfect conclusion. “When the phone was tied to a wire, we were free. When the phone got free from the wire, we got tied to it.” It perfectly describes our present scenario. rameshinder.sandhu@gmail.com The writer is an Amritsar-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/long-and-short-of-phone-calls-does-it-ring-a-bell-101629720744791.html

23-08-2021||Pune||Monday Musings: Maha politics unable to shed its casteist lineage, dating back 2 decades||Last week Raj Thackeray reiterated in Pune that caste politics in Maharashtra has escalated after the birth of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in 1999. In Maharashtra, caste and politics have often been inseparable since the formation of the state in the 1960s, even as the nature of the two has changed in the past two decades. If the agitation for the formation of unified Maharashtra was led by Brahmin (leftist) leadership in the form of SM Joshi, Nanasaheb Gore, and SA Dange, post-1960s saw Maratha domination over the power struggle. The formation of Sanyukta Maharashtra also gave birth to the term “bahujans” (majority of people). State’s first chief minister Yashwantrao Chavan emphasised two things: That the state would be governed by Marathi people rather than Marathas (a reference to the Maratha community) and it would usher in an era of Bahujan Samaj. By invoking Bahujans, Chavan wanted to imply non-elite, oppressed, non-Brahmin castes to send a message that the state will be ruled by the represented masses. This also helped him gain more acceptability among various non-Maratha communities. So when Raj Thackeray insisted that he had read the writings of both Prabodhankar Thackeray (his grandfather) and Yashwantrao Chavan, he was reminding Sharad Pawar of how the NCP has come to be known as a party of Marathas. For Maharashtra, its social-political fabric altered post the attack on the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (Bori), when a bunch of people ransacked the manuscripts at internationally acclaimed institute in 2004. The attack was allegedly prompted by a controversial book from American author James Laine – “Shivaji: A Hindu King in Islamic India”. This changed the equation between Brahmins and Marathas. The attack preceded Lok Sabha elections where parties like NCP made attempts to gain mileage by raking up the issue to whip up Maratha sentiments, to take on the BJP in order to polarise votes. The party reaped rich dividends during that, and subsequent elections, till the issue subsided. Pawar and NCP meanwhile, have tried to project themselves as party of bahujans, though it has had limited success expanding roots among OBCs and Dalits. The party has given prominence to leaders like Chhagan Bhujbal (an OBC) and Madhukar Pichhad (leader of nomadic tribes) to woe the respective vote banks. Pawar himself has on multiple occasions tried to project himself as a bahujan leader as part of his politics to target the BJP, which had a Brahmin face as chief minister of Maharashtra (Devendra Fadnavis between 2014 to 2019), to consolidate the bahujan vote bank in order to retain its stronghold of western Maharashtra. So asking partymen to shun the Puneri pagdi (turban) and instead use the Phule pagdi has suited Pawar in his politics. He chose to clarify his stand during the pagdi episode saying, he is a follower of Shahu Maharaj, Mahatma Phule and Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar’s philosophy of equality and wanted to convey that through this action (of shunning the Puneri Pagdi and instead wearing the Phule Pagdi). While referring to Chavan, Raj Thackeray also spoke about his grandfather – Keshav Sitaram Thackeray, who started a periodical Prabodhan (Awakening) in 1921, and came to be known as Prabodhankar. Prabodhankar was attracted to social reformer Jyotiba Phule’s writings and the core principle of Phule’s Satyashodhak Samaj organisation, to work for the social upliftment of members of the lowest castes. His biography – Majhi Jeevangatha (Story of My Life), also talked about influences in his early life. Although belonging to the Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu caste, Prabodhankar wrote against the dominance of Brahminism and advocated eradicating caste hierarchies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/monday-musings-maha-politics-unable-to-shed-its-casteist-lineage-dating-back-2-decades-101629715464448.html

However, hands-on training for shortlisted health personnel is yet to begin at AIIMS due to non confirmation of the schedule, people quoted above added.“We are in the process of finalising the framework for shortlisting health personnel to be sent for onsite training at AIIMS-Patna. We will share the schedule after we finalise it,” a government functionary said requesting anonymity.The Bihar government has decided in principle to nominate the institute as the centre of excellence for paediatrics management of Covid-19.“We shall release the online training module for trainees tomorrow (Tuesday). Good performers will be shortlisted for in-person training in consultation with the state government,” said Dr Lokesh Tiwari, additional professor and head of the department of paediatrics at AIIMS-Patna.The institute proposes to shortlist about 125 paediatricians and nurses (in equal numbers) to be divided into four batches that will get a week’s training each, spread over a month.“We propose to begin the week-long training in PICU management from August 31. The training session will continue for a month. However, we are awaiting a confirmation of the training schedule from the state health department,” added Dr Tiwari.He said the idea was to ensure that at least two doctors and nurses at each of the state’s 36 district hospitals are well trained to not only lead the paediatrics acute care units in districts of their posting but some of them also become trainers. The remaining 475 health personnel, trained through the online mode, are supposed to form a support structure around them at the sub-divisional hospitals and community health centres.The institute provided online training to 600 state healthcare workers in five days between August 10 and 18. As many as 200 paediatricians from across all the nine state-run medical colleges were trained on August 10, the first day of the online training programme, while the remaining 400 doctors and nurses from district hospitals were trained on August 12, 13, 17 and 18.Bihar reported 20 fresh Covid cases from 10 of the state’s 38 districts on Sunday, taking the total number of Covid-19 cases to 725,588 and fatalities to 9,649. The number of active Covid cases has also come down to 140.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/inperson-training-of-bihar-healthcare-workers-awaits-govt-nod-101629714864568.html

"We are gathered here for three of our demands first, refugee cards to apply for long-term visa (LTV) in India. Second, a resettlement option for which we need a supporting letter from the UNHRC so that we can move to another country. Third, security from the Indian government and UNHRC. We do not have any facilities like education and jobs," said Ahmad Zhia Ghani, head of the community in India.A large number of desperate Afghan citizens are coming to India following the takeover of the war-torn country by the Taliban. On August 17, the Ministry of External Affairs said India will issue emergency e-visas to Afghan nationals who want to come to the country in view of the prevailing crisis in their country. All Afghans, irrespective of their religion, can apply for the 'e-Emergency X-Misc Visa' online and the applications will be processed in New Delhi. The visas would initially be valid for six months, officials said.Also Read: Which countries are taking in Afghan refugees and which countries are not?While the UNHCR office in New Delhi grants refugee status to Afghans and citizens from other strife-torn nations and issues identification cards. However, as India is not a signatory to the UN Refugee convention of 195, Afghans or any group not recognised by the Ministry of home affairs (MHA) would not be able to enjoy the rights given in countries like the UK or US. Those who are recognised as refugees by UNHCR are issued an identity card, but these are not widely recognised by authorities. The UNHCR also has a resettlement programme which involves providing permanent residence in another country.As of 2019, Afghans accounted for around a third of the nearly 40,000 refugees registered in India, according to the UN refugee agency, but these figures do not cover those who are not registered with the UN. The families of Afghan peace envoy Abdullah Abdullah’s families and former President Hamid Karzai live in India. Karzai himself had spent years of his student life in India. Last year, the Indian mission in Kabul had facilitated the return of about 383 members of the Sikh and Hindu communities in Afghanistan, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi, told Hindustan Times earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/afghan-refugees-protest-before-unhcr-office-in-delhi-for-security-resettlement-101629712810649.html
23-08-2021||Bangalore||Bengaluru gold jewellers go on strike against new hallmarking rules||Several jewellers here shut their shops on Monday and went on strike against the central government's new gold hallmarking rules. As per the new guidelines, jewellers across India can now only sell gold items of 14, 18 and 22 carats.C Vinod Hayagriv, Director and Managing Director of C Krishniah Chetty Group, said under the new rules which came into effect from June 16, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has recognised only six types of karats: 14kt, 18kt, 20kt, 22kt, 23kt and 24kt.Any piece of jewellery made out of other karats will no longer be valid, said Hayagriv. "They will be allowed to be purchased by jewellers, but jewellers will not be allowed to re-sell even if a consumer wishes to buy such pre-owned jewellery even at a lower price."Also Read | Gold hallmarking mandatory from today: All you need to knowEven the sellers of old or antique jewellery will not get the desired or fair price, said Hayagriv. "We will have to either keep it unsold or melt it and remake it, although certain heritage pieces are worthy heirlooms of the past. Even belonging to large and distinguished families of last centuries."In this process, the valuation of heritage jewellery will come down by up to 30 per cent. "So the customer loses substantial value for such valuable heritage with provenance history, estate and pre-owned fine pieces of art and old jewellery," said Hayagriv.He said any legislation on hallmarking must have implicit approval of the BIS as well as the industry."If there are any disagreements, they should not be overly imposed but must continue to be voluntary till all stakeholders are completely in agreement and rules are completely clear."The government has also done away with mentioning the year of manufacture for all hallmarked jewellery which was a mandatory practice so far."Now both the consumers and jewellers can falsely claim historic value for their jewellery. This is not good practice," said Hayagriv.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bengaluru-gold-jewellers-go-on-strike-against-new-hallmarking-rules-101629710815696.html

Also read: Sidhu summons advisors as row erupts over their comments on Kashmir, PakSidhu, while seeking a higher state advised price (SAP) in Punjab, said that the sugarcane farmers issue needs to be immediately resolved amicably. “Strange that despite the higher cost of cultivation in Punjab, the state advised price is too low as compared to Haryana/Uttar Pradesh/Uttarakhand. As torchbearer of agriculture, the Punjab SAP should be better!” he tweeted, questioning his own party’s government over its cane pricing policy. The sugarcane farmers are protesting in Jalandhar for the past four days for higher prices. Sidhu admits BJP doing more for farmers: MalviyaThe tweet comparing the sugarcane prices in these states drew quick responses from leaders of the BJP, which has facing farmers’ protests in these states against its central government’s three agriculture laws, in different parts of the country. Amit Malviya, the national in-charge of BJP’s IT department, welcomed the newly appointed Punjab Congress president’s remark. “Good to see Navjot Singh Sidhu, new Punjab Congress chief, admit that BJP governments in UP, Haryana and Uttarakhand are doing a lot more for farmers than Congress-ruled Punjab,” he tweeted. The Haryana BJP also retweeted the Punjab Congress president’s comment from its official Twitter handle, stating that “truth can be rattled, not defeated”. Endorsement of Haryana’s farm policy: Dushyant Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala also said that Sidhu’s statement was an endorsement of the pro-farmer policies of the Haryana government. Referring to Sidhu’s tweet, Delhi BJP general secretary Kuljeet Singh Chahal said that farmers must understand the reality. The BJP MP from Kachchh, Vinod Chavda, said that Sidhu had admitted that the BJP governments in these three states were doing more for farmers than in Congress-ruled Punjab. Punjab has a Congress government headed by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, while Haryana, UP and Uttarakhand are ruled by the BJP. Though the Punjab government last week hiked the SAP by ₹15 per quintal to ₹325 for the early variety, the protesting farmers are not satisfied and want it to bring the price on a par with ₹350 per quintal in neighbouring Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-makes-hay-as-sidhu-takes-on-punjab-govt-on-sugarcane-prices-101629712644362.html

In India, there are different opinions. But, what may be applicable in the east of Birbhum (West Bengal) may not work in the west of Bankura (also West Bengal). There cannot be a readymade reply, an instant reply at hand, the situation is not so," Sen said.On the evaluation model in the present scenario, the economist said acquiring and sharing knowledge is more important."Even if we put emphasis on the evaluation, we must remember it is the last thing. Acquiring and sharing knowledge comes first. There are reasons to believe that the issue should be seen from different sides and perspectives," he said."When we learn something for the first time, when we first comprehend the matter … is that linked with evaluation? We have to see. Evaluation will be certainly of use, but how much and in what way? We have to see if there is a link between evaluation and real education," Sen pointed out.Asked about the threats to the environment, he said that either the world is aware of the problems and knows the solution but not proceeding in the right path or there needs to be threadbare discussions to find the directions to solve the crisis."Environment is an integral part of every work, every step taken by us," he reasoned.Sen, who is currently a Thomas W Lamont University professor, and rofessor of Economics and Philosophy at Harvard University, also stressed on tapping alternative energy resources such as solar and nuclear to protect the environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/no-readymade-solution-on-whether-to-reopen-schools-amid-covid-19-amartya-sen-101629707973963.html

The petition further states that the Bank of Karaj used in the series was a pseudonym for Bank of Karad and their alleged involvement in the scam was in public domain and confirmed by the RBI. “However, for ulterior motives, the complainant appears to have zeroed in with a laser beam on the fleeting display of a logo appearing on a calendar at the back of actors in a scene and registered the FIR,” says the petition. Shirish Gupte, senior counsel for Sony, submitted that the investigations were not in conformity with section 115 (4) of the Trademarks Act which stipulates that an officer of a rank not less than deputy superintendent (DySP) of Police has to conduct the probe, however the notice issued to his client was by a police inspector (PI). Amit Desai, senior advocate for Nair, said the web series could not be covered under the definition of goods under the Trademarks Act and hence no offence was made out under the said law. The court ahs granted ad-interim relief and stayed the investigation for three weeks and posted hearing of the petitions on September 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-stays-pune-police-probe-against-web-series-host-producer-101629705863978.html

The PAL group was created in September 2020 by Sudhir Kudalkar, the assistant commissioner of police with the anti-corruption bureau at Worli to take care of street animals during the pandemic. The young members of PAL group recently made and circulated videos with their views on animal cruelty and appeals to stop it. On the occasion of Rakshabandhan, they not only spread this video message but also tied Rakhis to street animals in their neighbourhood with the pledge to protect them from harm.Kudalkar said, “Raksha Bandhan means a bond of protection. Our voiceless animals are our best companions, protectors, who share an unbreakable bond of love with us. This time, we all celebrated the sacred relation with our strays by taking a pledge to protect them and care for them with all our hearts. So, many group members including the younger ones tied Rakhi to street animals on Sunday with the pledge to take care of them.”Six year old Diya Wadkar said Covid-19 was also tough on animals and the strays needed to be treated as part of the society. “This Rakshabandhan, I pledge love and respect to the street animals. I have seen elders asking watchmen to beat and remove street animals from our housing society, which is wrong... I promise to take care of cats or other animals from our area and to never harm them,” Wadkar said. 27-year old Mansi Rege from Mulund rescued 14 street dogs during this year’s flood. Now, everyone from her family has tied a Rakhi to these dogs, promising to take care of them.“We should not limit ourselves to sharing sweets and gifts on this Rakshabandhan, we should do something for others. Animals cannot speak about their problems and hence need greater care. On this Raksha Bandhan, I took a pledge to take care of them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-group-ties-rakhis-to-street-animals-vows-to-protect-them-101629700703305.html

23-08-2021||Patna||Security lapse allows murder convict to escape from open jail in Bihar||Bihar police claims to have launched an extensive manhunt for a murder convict who escaped from the open jail facility in Buxar prison on Sunday morning.Jodhan Sahni, 47, undergoing life imprisonment, was reported to be missing from the prison around 6pm, a good 12 hours after he was allowed to leave the prison for treatment at Sadar Hospital, located near the jail premises.“A court convicted him in a murder case in 2009 and awarded him life imprisonment. He was earlier lodged at the Bhagalpur Central Jail and was shifted to the open jail at Buxar Prison in 2020. He has fled from the open jail. A search has been launched,” said a prison official, who didn’t wish to be identified.Open jail concept has been introduced in 13 states of the country to encourage good conduct and self-discipline among inmates. As per Bihar Jail Manual 2008, well-behaved life term convicts over 30-years of age, belonging to the state, are eligible to be considered for open jail after spending 10 years behind bars among other criteria. Inmates convicted either for planned mass murder, murder of a public servant, or under the National Security Act, or court-martialed, aren’t considered for open jail. The Buxar open jail was inaugurated in 2012 and it currently accommodates 50 inmates along with their dependents.According to the FIR lodged by prison authorities, Sahni, who was staying in the open jail with his wife, slipped away after gaining permission to go to the Sadar Hospital on Sunday morning. “At around 6.10 am, Sahni left for the hospital for treatment but did not return till 6pm,” said Dinesh Kumar Malakar, the station house officer (SHO) of Town police station. He added that a police team has been dispatched for Bhagalpur to search him.A senior prison official said this was perhaps the first instance of a prisoner escaping from the open jail in Bihar. The incident was being seen as a security lapse and it is being questioned how a convict involved in a heinous crime was allowed to stay in the open prison, which allows for greater freedom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/security-lapse-allows-murder-convict-to-escape-from-open-jail-in-bihar-101629698482983.html

All those who have been selected will get their appointment letters but the processes have to be completed. The third stage counselling will also begin and we will issue appointment letters for all of them after verification of documents to avoid hassles post appointment,” he said.The state government is treading cautiously with recruitment of teachers to ensure the process is error-free, unlike the past, leading to reprimands from courts and allegations of irregularities.

The minister later clarified that the STET merit list was only for determining eligibility and the merit list for appointment will be issued by the recruiting agencies at the level of panchayati raj institutions as per the laid down processes.Earlier, counselling in 400 recruiting agencies at the panchayat level had to be cancelled due to irregularities in the preparation of the merit list. Some more irregularities have surfaced, while the administration awaits counselling reports from around 22 districts.“Once the reports come and the verification of documents is done, appointment letters will be issued to all those selected, but the processes have to be followed. The schedule for [appointment of] another 30,000 teachers in secondary schools will also be out soon. There are vacancies and the government wants to fill all of them to make sure schools run properly,” said the minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/aspiring-teachers-in-bihar-use-creative-tweets-to-demand-appointment-letters-101629692602593.html

In 2015, GMADA had acquired 229 acres under a land pooling scheme, of which around 70 acres was under litigation till February this year. A senior GMADA official, who is dealing with the project, said, “Our layout plan is ready but some area near Lakhnaur is under the Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900, on which we have to carry out afforestation first. We are hopeful of doing it in coming days.”Gurjot Singh, a resident of Lakhnaur and one of the allottees, said, “Even after six years, 700 allottees are waiting for possession while the nearby sectors are all developed. We request the authorities concerned to expedite work on developing Sector 90.” Under land pooling, farmers were offered housing and commercial sites in lieu of their land, he said.As per the plan, GMADA was to initially develop 144 acres. Residential plots measuring 100 to 500 square yards will come up over 29 acres, commercial sites will come up over 14 acres and 11 acres will be earmarked for institutions. Parks will be developed over eight acres, waterworks will take up two acres and roads will be constructed over 28 acres.GMADA chief engineer Davinder Singh said: “We are waiting for the layout plans from the town planning wing, following which we will start the process of seeking environment clearance. We are hopeful of starting the development soon. Sector 90 is a prime location for residential end-users, commercial real estate markets, and investors,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/6-yrs-on-gmada-fails-to-approve-layout-plan-to-develop-sector-90-101629666139807.html

23-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh advisory council’s tenure extended by 6 months||UT administrator VP Singh Badnore has extended the tenure of the administrator’s advisory council by another six months.The council’s two-year tenure, which was to end on August 5, has been extended to March 31, 2022. The present 60-member council was constituted in August 2019.The apex advisory body of the administration last met in February this year. In its two-year tenure, the council proved inconsequential in the delivery of any crucial decisions or resolving long-standing issues of the city.Headed by the UT administrator, it is responsible for advising the administration on development issues and policy matters affecting the city, and gives a platform to residents to air their views on a range of issues concerning the city.In addition to all senior UT officials, it includes the current and former members of Parliament, mayor, residents’ and business association representatives, and other prominent citizens. It also has 10 standing committees, which are subject-matter-related groups headed by a chairman.Panel’s working under scrutiny The working and relevance of the council has come under increasing scanner in the last couple of years.Its last meeting, which was two hours long, saw UT officials making presentations on the administration’s achievements. The Chandigarh Police gave a presentation for around 15 minutes, which was followed by a 45-minute presentation by UT chief engineer CB Ojha.Thereon, only some council members, mostly political leaders and bureaucrats, got an opportunity to speak. As a result, representatives of the market, residents’ and industry associations sought changes in the format of the meeting.Suggestions were also made for action-taken reports to be tabled before the council members, to apprise them of the measures taken by the administration on the previously-issued recommendations by the council and its sub-committees.Critics have also voiced concern over the irregular nature of meetings and it “not being a truly people’s representative institution”. “While most of the time, there are no discussions in the council, the members are not even informed of the results of their deliberations, if any,” said a member who didn’t want to be quoted.Sub-committees ineffectiveThe current and former members have contended that even the sub-committees have no relevance in the scheme of city’s governance. Though considered as expert committees, set up to threadbare examine specific subjects, the committees lack adequate subject-matter experts. Their decisions and recommendations are now not even compiled as “minutes of meeting” but only as “issues discussed”.In recent times, the committees have even contradicted each other’s findings and recommendations.For instance, on the issue of allowing construction of new nursing homes in residential areas, the panel on health and urban planning differed, reaching different conclusions.The standing committee on urban infrastructure and planning for the city, in a meeting held in July last year, rejected the proposal. Their contention was that these were purely commercial activities and offered expensive health care facilities. All its members opposed the move.But later, the matter was referred to another panel, committee on health, which, in its meeting held in March this year, unanimously recommended the opening of nursing homes in residential areas, but with certain conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-advisory-council-s-tenure-extended-by-6-months-101629665660207.html

23-08-2021||Chandigarh||SC stays trial against ex-Haryana CM Hooda, 21 others in Panchkula industrial plots allotment case||The Supreme Court (SC) has stayed the trial under provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and 21 others in Panchkula industrial plots allotment case. Hearing a bunch of petitions, a three-member bench of the apex court comprising justice AM Khanwilkar, justice Krishna Murari and justice V Ramasubramanian on August 19 granted a stay on the PMLA court’s trial on the basis of a December 2019 apex court order. The SC, in its December 2019 order, had stayed trial in a similar PMLA case pending before the special court, principal sessions judge, city civil court, Chennai. The December 2019 SC order came after a bench of the Madras HC had dismissed a petition which sought quashing of PMLA proceedings as the predicate or scheduled offence investigated by the CBI was closed by the order of the court. Vikram Chaudhari, counsel of the petitioner and an accused in Panchkula industrial plots allotment case, Lt Col OP Dahiya (retd) had invited the attention of the apex court to the December 2019 order passed in a special leave petition and sought similar interim protection for the petitioner as the facts and circumstances were similar to that petition. About the grounds taken by Lt Col Dahiya in his petition before the apex court, his counsel Chaudhari told HT that since the CBI has not filed a chargesheet in the Panchkula case and no trial has begun for the predicate or scheduled offence, the trial under PMLA cannot proceed. “We have also challenged a 2019 amendment in section 44 of the PMLA wherein an explanation was inserted,’’ Chaudhri said. The explanation inserted in 2019 for removal of doubts about section 44 of PMLA said the jurisdiction of special court while dealing with the offence under PMLA, during investigation, inquiry or trial under this act, shall not be dependent upon any orders passed in respect of the scheduled offence, and the trial of both sets of offences by the same court shall not be construed as joint trial. Chaudhri said the SC had in Nikesh Tarachand Shah case had in 2017 held that trial of both the predicate offences and PMLA go together. However, the 2019 amendment in PMLA changed this, he said, adding this amendment is also under challenge. In February, the Enforcement Directorate had filed a prosecution complaint (a chargesheet) under PMLA in a trial court against Hooda and others in the Panchkula case despite the fact that CBI which was probing the matter was yet to submit a chargesheet for the predicate offences registered under IPC and Prevention of Corruption Act. The ED document had triggered discussions on why the agency submitted a chargesheet charging the accused for money laundering before the CBI, probing the predicate offence, could do so. The ED says that every scheduled offence is a predicate offence and the occurrence of the same is a pre-requisite for initiating investigation into the offence of money laundering. The predicate offences are investigated by agencies such as police, customs, SEBI, NCB and CBI, under their respective Acts, the ED says. Legal experts said the answer to ED’s urgency in submitting the chargesheet lay in the 2019 amendments made in the PMLA which now provided that attachment of property involved in money laundering will remain valid during the period of investigation for 365 days. In this case, the 14 industrial plots were attached by ED in August 2019 and the attachment was confirmed by the adjudicating authority in February 2020. “Once the attachments have been confirmed by the adjudicating authority, the ED will have to submit a chargesheet in court within a year. Otherwise, these attachments would become invalid,’’ said a law expert. Experts say that the 2019 explanation was inserted in section 44 to insulate the trial of money laundering offences from the outcome of the trial of the predicate offence by CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sc-stays-trial-against-ex-haryana-cm-hooda-21-others-in-panchkula-industrial-plots-allotment-case-101629662900053.html

23-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC fund crunch: Projects worth ₹380 cr in limbo||Development works worth more than ₹380 crore -- planned and ongoing -- may get stalled, with the municipal corporation struggling to source funds for them.The fund-starved MC had recently assessed its capacity to undertake the works spread over this year and the findings don’t promise a bright road ahead. As per a report compiled by the UT engineering department, on the directions of former MC commissioner KK Yadav, liabilities of around ₹380 crore stand for the department if it is to implement different development projects in the city.Projects that are likely to be impacted include all the capital works, village and ward development works, and extended road recarpeting works.The village development works include new roads, laying stormwater pipes and sewer lines, electrical and horticulture works, supply of water and installing more than 1,000 tube-wells for improving water supply.“Except for the dedicated funds for road recarpeting and deposit works (expansion of the water storage capacity at water works), the MC is likely to face severe fund crunch to start or complete other development projects. Every month, MC has fixed liabilities of around ₹62 crore for salaries alone,” said an MC official who didn’t want to be named. There is also concern that the administration will release reduced quarterly grant-in-aid to the MC as the Union government had imposed a 20% restriction on spending.The MC had started the current fiscal with a deficit of ₹670 crore. Against a budget of ₹1,641 crore for 2021-22, the civic body had estimated only ₹971 crore in its kitty.Liabilities as per stage of projectOnly a section of the works is currently underway, while the rest are in different stages of implementation.A liability of ₹33 crore stands for projects which have been approved by the MC General House and the Finance and Contract Committee (F&CC), but are awaiting administrative approval. Projects in which all approvals are in place but the tender process is yet to start are around ₹116 crore.“Then there are projects, worth around ₹71 crore, for which the tender process has already been initiated. For around ₹116 crore worth projects, work has already been allotted but these are yet to start. Even the ongoing works, worth ₹152 crore are at stake,” said the official.Recent fund requestsFacing severe fund shortage, the MC had recently written to the administration to grant ₹26 crore on account of electricity duty.Earlier, with the administration not releasing the full grant promised under the dedicated fund for development of 13 villages, the MC had written to it to either release ₹20 crore or have these works done by the UT engineering department.“Funds of ₹15.85 crore are required for repairing internal streets, ₹2.04 crore for repair of buildings, ₹1.17 crore for horticulture and electrical works,” said the official.Notably, the UT has already junked MC request for the release of ₹90 crore as additional grant for the current fiscal. The additional grant was sought in lieu of the estimated loss in revenue on account of stay on hike of water tariff.Mayor Ravi Kant Sharma, said, “We have funds for all the works, for which tenders have already been allotted. More funds are in the pipeline. For instance, the administration has already agreed in principle to transfer the electricity duty. A reminder on Fourth Pay commission funds have been sent to Union government. There will be no shortage of funds for any of the development works planned this year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-fund-crunch-projects-worth-rs-380-cr-in-limbo-101629662359575.html

The people belonging to the upper caste are seeking removal of the statue, leading to tension in the village.Personnel of the CRPF and Haryana Police have been deployed in the village as a precautionary measure and the village has been sealed. People belonging to the Dalit community during a meeting in the village hit out at the administration for not letting their supporters in.Rajat Kalsan, a Dalit activist, said they always co-operate with the upper caste families, including in their protest against Centre’s farm laws. “They opposed the installation of Ambedkar’s statue in the village. A youth had hurled stones at the statue and police have failed to take action against him. We have lodged a complaint against them, but the police are yet to register an FIR. Police are not letting our supporters enter the village. We have decided to boycott the farm agitation. Our members have pledged to install BR Ambedkar’s statue in every village of Haryana by December 31,” he added.Fatehabad deputy commissioner Mahavir Kaushik and superintendent of police Rajesh Kumar met both the groups but couldn’t succeed in striking a compromise. The Dalit community members have asked the administrative officials to rename the ‘panchayat ghar’ as BR Ambedkar Bhawan.Fatehabad SP Kumar said heavy security has been deployed in the village to control the situation. “Two-layered barricading has been done in the nine streets of the village. We have asked both the groups to resolve the issue amicably. We will take strict action against those who will try to vitiate the atmosphere,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tension-in-fatehabad-village-as-dalit-upper-caste-families-lock-horns-over-ambedkar-statue-101629662240018.html

The work on the ‘green lungs project’, as it is called, has begun after the state government approved ₹50 lakh fund for the initiative that will help create a thick tree cover in the city’s vicinity, said divisional forest officer (DFO) Swaran Singh. In the first phase, a 1-km stretch with 37-metre width will be developed as a green cover. A total of 65 native tree species will be grown whereas the Nanak Bagichi section will have 36 varieties of medicinal plants. The green belt will also have 10 bamboo species besides conifer, ficus and other native fruit varieties like karonda (black currant), phalsa (blueberry) and sitaphal (custard apple). A butterfly zone will also be developed with dense vegetation of flower-bearing plants like sadabahar, jasmine and chandni etc. “Trees like vann (salvadora oleides), jand (prosopis cineraria), simbal (bombax), ber (Indian jujube) and mulberry were once commonly found in the semi-arid and arid regions of south Malwa. But these trees with medicinal and commercial value are now rarely spotted. In the absence of enough knowledge, people have switched their liking to ornamental plants or the species not ideal for climatic conditions of the belt,” Swaran Singh said. Vann and jand too are among the vanishing tree species in the region, he added. “The wood of vann was commonly used for making of charkha. Lightweight and sturdy, the wood was preferred for furniture making. We have some vann trees in Bathinda and adjoining districts but they are dying. Flowering on jand is preferred by apiculturists and they go to Rajasthan where jand groves are found in abundance,” said Singh, whose team’s project concept of the botanical garden was appreciated by the chief minister’s office. The department has identified the stretch along the canal banks behind its nursery. The vicinity is already home to a variety of fauna such as jungle babbler, peacocks, parrots, and red-wattled lapwing.Due to official apathy, the area was being used as an unauthorised waste dump by several marriage palaces and banquet halls. “An all-season pathway will be built without using any concrete material and the green belt will be powered by solar energy,” the DFO added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/biodiversity-park-to-come-up-in-bathinda-to-revive-south-punjab-s-vanishing-tree-species-101629662135276.html

The corporation has already directed the dairy owners to shift their businesses to the allotted site at nearby Abolowal village. The dairy owners had approached the Punjab and Haryana High Court against the corporation’s move but their petition was quashed last week. Patiala has as many as 257 dairies that cause frequent choking of sewers and water-logging in the city. The dairy owners have been given plots at government-controlled rates at the 21-acre site at Ablowal village. The owners have to deposit 5% of the reserved price, while the remaining amount will be paid in instalments. The MC missed the June 30, 2020, deadline for the completion of first phase of the project due to the pandemic. Nearly 6,000 milch animals will be relocated to the new site.Patiala mayor Sanjeev Sharma Bittu said all preparations have been made to shift the dairies out of the city before September 30. “We are not going to allow dairy operations after September 30. We have already developed the site and more than 150 dairy owners have been allotted the plots,” he said.The state government had floated tender for the shifting project to a private company, NH Constructions, in February last year. The project cost is pegged at ₹13.5 crore as work on approach roads, a sewage treatment plant, veterinary hospitals has started.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-dairy-to-be-allowed-to-operate-in-city-after-sept-30-patiala-mc-101629662132105.html

The cancellations perhaps had the most gut-wrenching consequences for Dalbir Singh, a resident of Farrukhabad, Uttar Pradesh, whose bookings were cancelled thrice, due to which he could neither be there with his ailing father when he breathed his last nor was he able to perform his last rites. Dalbir, who works at a food joint in Jammu and Kashmir, immediately boarded a roadways bus with his relatives upon learning that his father was critically ill. However, they were stuck in a massive traffic jam amid the farmer protests at a highway near Jalandhar. They managed to reach the Ludhiana railway station, hoping to board a train, but have been stranded there since Friday. “My father passed away waiting for me. I have been running from pillar to post for the last three days, but to no avail. Our reservations were cancelled three times and we cannot afford to board a private bus due to the steep fares,” he said. When he approached the railways staff, Dalbir alleged that he was rudely brushed off. Dalbir is not alone. Dheeraj, a resident of Nirwana, Rajasthan, came to Ludhiana for Raksha Bandhan, says, “I had booked a Kota special train that was scheduled to depart at 5:50am on August 23, but it has been cancelled. I have come to the station for a refund. I am planning to take an alternative means of transport.” Vinay of Bhawani Mandi, Rajasthan, was also in the same boat as his train, the Jamnagar special scheduled for 4pm on Sunday was cancelled. “I have to report to work on Monday, but I’m stuck. I might have to take an alternative mode of travel,” says Vinay. Primarily, trains running towards Amritsar and Katra were affected. Other than cancellation and diversion of routes, a few trains also got delayed for hours including the Paschim Express which plies on Amritsar-New Delhi route.Shiv Salwan, a Ludhiana resident said that he had to reschedule his meeting in Delhi as Paschim Express which was scheduled to reach Ludhiana station at 10:20 am arrived at 1:25 pm. Among the trains that have been cancelled include the Amritsar-New Delhi Shatabdi, the Vande Bharat express which runs on the New Delhi to Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Katra route, the Haridwar-Amritsar Jan Shatabdi and Amritsar-Hazur Sahib Nanded special train.Routes of 10 trains, which were to run on Monday, have been diverted and around 25 trains have been short terminated and short originated.Notably, till the filing of this report, the railway had issued a refund of ₹1.2 lakh to passengers. A senior railway official said that the refund was issued on the spot at the three railway windows. Disgruntled passengers take to Twitter Disgruntled passengers whose trains were either cancelled or halted bombarded the Firozpur division of Northern Railways with queries and complaints.A Twitter user, Bhism Narayan Sharma, mentioned his Passenger Name Record (PNR) number and raised the issue of absence of catering services in his train, which had been diverted to another route. “I don’t know where we are headed to, there is no on-board catering, neither is the train at any station. I do know when we will reach our destination and when we will get food”, read his tweet.The Northern Railways responded to the query saying the matter had been forwarded to the Ferozepur divisional railway manager.Many others tweeted their queries as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-protest-man-unable-to-perform-father-s-last-rites-due-to-disrupted-train-schedules-101629662002248.html

23-08-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab cane farmers continue rail, road blockade as talks with govt remain inconclusive||The deadlock between the Punjab government and sugarcane growers protesting for hike in crop prices continued on Sunday after the farmer representatives’ meeting with cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and officials in Chandigarh remained inconclusive. The protesters continued blockade of the national highway and railway tracks at Dhanowali village in Jalandhar district, affecting road transport and train movement. Bhartiya Kisan Union (Rajewal) leader Balbir Singh Rajewal, BKU (Doaba) president Manjit Singh Rai and others met Randhawa. It was decided after the meeting that the farmers will hold another meeting with government experts on Monday over the production cost of sugarcane and chief minister Amarinder Singh will take a final call on the issue the next day. The farmer leaders expressed disappointment over the state government increasing the sugarcane’s state agreed price (SAP) from ₹310 to ₹325 without taking them into confidence. “The farmers were requested to clear the rail tracks so that fertilisers could reach in the state,” said a farmer representative. In the meeting, the government experts claimed that production cost should be ₹350 per quintal, the farmer unions pegged it at ₹392. Randhawa also made a senior farmer leader to talk to Amarinder Singh over phone, it is learnt. Talking to mediapersons, Randhawa said, “We will clear the pending dues of sugarcane crop within 15 days. The farmer leaders will hold a meeting over the price comparison with experts from Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) and government officials.” He said there was ₹43 crore pending of the Phagwara sugar mill. “I have directed the Kapurthala administration to get it cleared or take action against the mill. We have assured them that the government will not let the Phagwara mill shut at any cost,” added Randhawa. Rai said it was shocking that the e experts didn’t inform the government over the production cost. “In meeting, the experts admitted that the production cost is ₹350 per quintal while Punjab government gives us ₹325 per quintal rate,” he said. 83 trains affected The Ferozepur railway division said a total of 83 trains were affected due to the blockade on the Ludhiana-Amritsar rail track. Of these, 48 were cancelled, 12 diverted and 23 short-terminated, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cane-farmers-continue-rail-road-blockade-as-talks-with-govt-remain-inconclusive-101629661703602.html
23-08-2021||Chandigarh||Bathinda flooded after rain, man dies in roof collapse||A six-hour-long downpour, the heaviest in Bathinda this monsoon season, brought the city to a standstill on Sunday, exposing the ill-preparedness of municipal authorities yet another time.The city received 81 mm rain, said Dr Raj Kumar, an agro-meteorology scientist at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU)’s regional research centre in Bathinda. There was a flood-like situation in most parts of the city represented in the Punjab assembly by finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, with the water level reaching over 5 feet at some places. Low-lying areas such as Paras Ram Nagar, Power House Road, Mall Road and Sirki Bazaar were the worst-affected by the rainfall that started around 5am and continued till 11am.Manohar Singh (50), a local resident, died while his son Azad Singh (22) sustained serious injuries after the roof of their house at the city’s Bhalerian Wala Mohalla collapsed during rainfall on Sunday.Azad is under treatment at the civil hospital. Residents from various localities complained of water entering their houses, causing damage to buildings and household items. Even the posh localities like Model Town and vicinity of Sepal Hotel faced waterlogging probably for the first time. Many were forced to stay in their houses on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan.The municipal authorities started an operation to drain out the water.Former Bathinda legislator Sarup Chand Singla blamed political interference in the functioning of the municipal corporation, demanding compensation for the loss of property and goods of the city residents. “Waterlogging is a chronic problem in the city and the Congress leadership failed to take any concrete step. Flooding is caused due to poor maintenance of drains and failure of enhanced capacity to flush out the rainwater. Haphazard repair of streets ahead of the state elections disturbed road levels and flooded streets,” said Singla.Municipal commissioner Bikramjit Singh Shergill said the civic body for the first time pressed into service 940 hp capacity pumps to drain out water.“Last year, pumps of a total maximum capacity of 440 hp were deployed. Had it been the last season’s situation, it would take us to drain water in more than 24 hours whereas the city roads will be cleared of water before Sunday midnight,” said Shergill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bathinda-flooded-after-rain-man-dies-in-roof-collapse-101629661702314.html

Officials said this will be the state first sugar mill to produce sugar free of sulphur, an additive used for the purpose of purifying sugar. A month-long trial of the new sugar mill had already been completed earlier this year. “The sugar mill with a capacity of 3,500-tonne crushing per day (TCD) will provide a big relief to farmers as its capacity has been increased from 2,200TCD,” said Aditi, managing director of the Sugar mill. Mill officials said the trial of the new sugar mill had started in April this year and it produced 94,460 quintals refined sugar by crushing 10.30-lakh quintals sugarcane. The mill has set a target to crush 55-lakh quintals sugarcane. The managing director said the sugar mill has an 18MW power generation plant and it will produce electricity for self-consumption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/karnals-mill-to-start-producing-sulphur-free-sugar-from-this-season-101629661581945.html

The project is being funded by the Ludhiana municipal corporation and the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB).The mayor said that work has already started on two new sewage treatment plants (STPs) with a combined capacity of 285 MLD – Jamalpur 225 MLD and Balloke 60 MLD; the rehabilitation of existing STPs with a treatment capacity of 418 MLD, two effluent treatment Plants (ETPs) for the treatment of 6 MLD wastewater from two dairy complexes in Tajpur and Haibowal, six intermediate pumping stations and the laying of a 10-km pipeline under the ₹650-crore rejuvenation project. “The project will be completed by December 2022,” he said. Bouquets and brickbats However, Jaskirat Singh, of the Naroa Punjab Manch said that the Buddha Darya Rejuvenation Project should be led by eminent scientists not politicians and bureaucrats. “Did they conducted any study before initiating the ₹9-crore project. A project that could impact on the health and lives of millions should be led by an eminent scientist who can assess the consequences of the project,” he said. Kapil Arora, the president of the counsel of engineers, says the release of 200 cusec of water into the Buddha Nullah from Neelon is merely a cosmetic activity. “The dyeing and electroplating industries have always been saved by the PPCB. Now, with the release of water from Neelon before Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) become operational will help mask the fact that industries are primarily responsible for polluting the rivulet,” he said, adding that if mixing of freshwater would have effectively reduced pollution, the polluted waters of Sutlej would not have caused serious health problems such as cancer and Hepatitis-B among citizens residing hundreds of kilometres away from Ludhiana. Rahul Verma, a social activist, said, “I can see Buddha Nullah turning into Budha Dariya in the next two years. Simply blaming the industry will not provide a solution. The contribution of the industry cannot be ignored. The industry is playing a pivotal role in the development of the city and providing employment to many. As responsible citizens, we should also reduce the use of detergents, dishwasher, toilets cleaners and other chemicals as the city is the biggest consumer of such products in the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/work-to-clean-buddha-nullah-starts-with-release-of-200-cusecs-fresh-water-in-ludhiana-101629661520398.html

23-08-2021||Mumbai||Had Godse killed Jinnah instead of Gandhi, partition would’ve been averted: Shiv Sena||In the backdrop of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement to observe August 14 as Partition Horrors Remembrance Day, the Shiv Sena has questioned what did the people, who are now vouching for undivided India, do when the country was on the verge of the partition. The Sena has also said that the believer of ‘Undivided Hindurashtra’ had admitted to the two-nation theory and run away from the battleground. Shiv Sena parliamentarian Sanjay Raut, in his weekly column Rokthok in party mouthpiece Saamana, has said that there would have been no need to observe such a day had Nathuram Godse, who killed Mahatma Gandhi, had trained his gun on Jinnah, the man responsible for creation of Pakistan. “Godse held Gandhi responsible for partition and killed him. Was Jinnah less responsible? Had Godse killed Jinnah, there would have been no need to observe Partition Horrors Remembrance Day in the first place, after 75 years. Jinnah secured Pakistan only on the strength of his typewriter and legal skills. Jinnah’s killing would have averted the creation of Pakistan,” said Raut.Raut has also outlined that partition of India was indeed a horrific event which left wounds on Hindus, however, those who opposed it just laid down their arms like the soldiers in Afghanistan. Raut said those who advocate ‘Akhand Hindustan (Undivided India) and reunification of India and Pakistan were the ones who at the time of independence had accepted the idea of Pakistan and did not fight for it. He quoted Marathi scholar Narhar Kurundkar, who said that these people accepted the Muslim League’s theory of partition and had retreated from the battlefield.Raut said that Jinnah and other Muslim leaders had left the Congress as Mahatma Gandhi refused to accede to their unreasonable demands for Muslims. He said it was Lokmanya Tilak who had accepted the demand for Separate Electorates for the Muslims, which was eventually scrapped by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru after India got freedom.While signing off the article, Raut said if Modi wants to create ‘Akhand Hindustan’, it was a welcome move, but he needs to specify what will be the fate of 110 million Muslims residing in that country.Reacting on the remarks in the column, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Ram Kadam said it was an attempt by the Sena to whitewash the deeds of the Congress. “(Sena founder) Balasaheb Thackeray used to bash the Congress for its role in the partition of the country and here we have this Sena defending its role. This shows how they have compromised their ideology to remain in power. Sena should understand that PM Modi’s aim was to remind the present and the future generations that such incidents need to be prevented,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/had-godse-killed-jinnah-instead-of-gandhi-partition-would-ve-been-averted-shiv-sena-101629660501022.html

Meanwhile, restaurants were allowed to open till 10pm.Restaurateurs said that restrictions on business in the evening reduced dinner sales and were hampering recovery.“We welcome and applaud the relaxation of rules by the Delhi government in terms of operational hours. It is an extremely encouraging move for the F&B [food and beverage] industry, which will help us to recover and revive our business slowly but surely. A lot of our dinner guests, at both SOCIAL and Smoke House Deli, have been wanting to stay past 10pm and extend their night, and being operational for longer will allow us to do just that. It also gives us room to cater to our guests comfortably without overcrowding at any point in time,” said Satyajit Dhingra, chief regional officer (north), Impresario Handmade Restaurants.Ahead of the festive season, a return to normal business timings is expected to benefit restaurants looking to cover losses.“Our strict safety and hygiene protocols remain in play, with 50% capacity and adequate social distancing at all our restaurants,” Dhingra added.Saurabh Suman, manager of Pebble Street in New Friends Colony (NFC), said restricted timings discouraged guests from visiting the outlet for dinner, a crucial driver of daily sales.“Guests were not comfortable due to the early wrap-up deadline. People usually arrive for dinner by 7.30-8.30pm. By then, we already need to start preparing for the closure. Due to these limitations, people stopped planning dinner outings.”Welcoming the move, SN Kaushal, senior manager of Kwality restaurant at Connaught Place, said, “It doesn’t look good when someone is out for dinner and we have to constantly remind them to wrap up early. Some guests would also complain about the same. Now, we will be able to serve our guests as before,” said Kaushal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/deadlines-lifted-eateries-hope-for-swift-return-to-normal-in-delhi-101629660126004.html
23-08-2021||Mumbai||2 arrested for threatening Mumbai developer||The anti-extortion cell (AEC) of crime branch arrested two people after a private developer received threats on multiple occasions. The accused have been identified as Anant Shetty, 47, and Hemant Banker, 71. The police said the complainant had met Banker through a common friend in 2018 and had helped them in business. The complainant alleged that a few months later, Banker’s son and his wife withdrew ₹35 crore from his account in Dubai by submitting his fake documents and signature. A case has been registered in the matter in Dubai against Banker’s son and wife, who are reportedly in the United Kingdom (UK), said a crime branch officer. When the complainant started asking his money back from Banker, the accused stopped receiving his phone calls. The complainant further alleged that a man, who identified himself as gangster Vijay Shetty, had called him on July 16, 2019. He allegedly threatened the complainant against taking any legal action on Banker, added the officer. “The complainant alleged that between July and August 2019, he had received multiple threat calls from Vijay Shetty. Banker also called the complainant and told him that he required more time to return his money,” the remand application of the accused stated. The complainant approached the police, where a case was registered. “During investigation, we learnt that Banker had allegedly asked Anant Shetty, who knew the gangster, to threaten the complainant, said the officer. The police then arrested Anant Shetty on August 19, while Banker was held two days later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/2-arrested-for-threatening-mumbai-developer-101629660141579.html
23-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: After Kirit Somaiya’s plaint, Shiv Sena’s Milind Narvekar razes part of his bungalow||After Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Kirit Somaiya complained of illegal construction at Dapoli seashore, Ratangiri, to the Union environment ministry, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s close confidant and Shiv Sena secretary Milind Narvekar has demolished the structure on Sunday. The ground-plus-two-storey structure was being constructed by Narvekar allegedly without taking permissions related to coastal regulation zone (CRZ) despite the land in Murud village in Dapoli – a popular holiday destination – falling within the restricted area. It is located on a plot spanning around 1.80 acres, which was purchased by Narvekar. Narvekar was not available for comment despite several attempts, while Shiv Sena leaders refused to comment on the issue. Narvekar has been an influential figure both in the party and government. The action is considered as a blow to the party, especially when the relations between Sena and BJP have strained to a great extent. After Somaiya’s complaint, a team of officials from the ministry had visited the site about a month ago. The team reportedly directed the state authorities to take action. The state authorities are said to have warned the Sena leader of action against the illegal construction. To avoid any further embarrassment, Narvekar himself demolished the illegal structure. “I am not aware of it [demolition]. I will have to seek the information from local level officials,” said BN Patil, district collector, Ratnagiri. According to the officials from Dapoli tehsil office, Narvekar has removed the extra construction which had no permission. “The structure was on 2,500 sq ft of which 940 sq ft had permission. Remaining area has been demolished on Sunday morning. There was no intimation given to the local authorities,” the official said. Somaiya said he would be visiting the bungalow site and will demand a criminal action against Narvekar. “After my complaint to the environment ministry, a central team had visited the site of illegal construction a month ago. Narvekar failed to submit proof to corroborate his claim of having taken all the permissions. The central team had directed the state government, district collector and state environment authorities for action. The authorities had warned the Sena leader of action, after which he removed a portion of the bungalow and claimed that the illegal structure was demolished. I visited the site last week and exposed his lie, after which state authorities woke up. To avoid further embarrassment, Narvekar himself demolished the construction,” he said. Somaiya said that though the structure has been demolished, it is a serious violation of the CRZ norms and attract penal action. “I will visit the bungalow site on Monday to ensure that the structure has been fully demolished. I will also meet the local administration and demand that an FIR (first information report) be filed for the illegal construction. The hearing against the illegal construction by another Sena leader and state transport minister Anil Parab is in its last leg at the National Green Tribunal, after which action will also be taken against his structure too,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtraafter-kirit-somaiya-s-plaint-shiv-sena-s-milind-narvekar-razes-part-of-his-bungalow-101629659900733.html

The victim – Kishore Jain, 45 – had not employed any staffers. On Saturday, he came to the shop at 10.40am. The CCTV of the shop has captured two men, wearing caps and masks, entering the shop. They headed to the strong room. The police said the duo tied Jain, gagged him and then slit his neck and stabbed him on stomach when he did not give them the keys of the safes. They were then seen walking towards Nallasopara station in CCTV. “Some silver jewellery is missing. The killers couldn’t open the two safes where gold was kept,” said senior inspector Vilas Supe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/jeweller-killed-near-mumbai-10-police-teams-on-lookout-to-nab-killers-101629659839493.html
23-08-2021||Delhi||‘Intense spells of rain harming Delhi's ecology’||Up until the evening of August 20, Delhi stood at a 60% monthly rainfall deficit. On August 22, the city’s rainfall recordings showed a surplus of 11%, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD) data.This leap was a result of intense rainfall the national capital received largely within a span of six hours on Saturday. Scientists and weather experts said that such short, intense spells may appear to be a positive indication, but they are not doing any good to the city’s ecology.IMD recordings showed that as on Sunday afternoon, the Safdarjung weather station, which provides representative data for the city, recorded a monthly rainfall surplus of 11% and Lodi Road station recorded a surplus of 5%. The Palam observatory still stands at a deficit of 19%.On Sunday, only the weather station at Ridge received “trace rainfall” – light rain that is not enough to be recorded.While the rain recorded till Friday was 63.7mm, it rose to 211.2mm by August 22, as against the normal 190.2mm by this time of the month. With no rain on Sunday, the jump of 138.8mm was the highest single-day rainfall to be recorded in August over the last 14 years and the ninth highest since 1961, IMD records showed.IMD records show that previously, Delhi received such a heavy 24-hour spell in this month on August 2, 2007, when the city got 166.6mm rainfall. The highest-ever single-day rainfall recorded during this month is on August 2, 1961 (184mm).IMD’s forecast says that light rain is likely to continue in the city for the next few days, but from August 25, Delhi could see another dry spell.Met officials also said that Delhi this year is likely to see a “near normal to surplus” monsoon season.Met officials said that the majority of Saturday’s rain (138.8mm) was concentrated between a six-hour window of 2.30am and 8.30am.“If you look at the actual number of rainy days in August this time, there have only been four. From August 9, north-west India entered into a break monsoon phase and even before that, the month had a slow start to rain. The interesting bit is that from Tuesday, there is another dry spell in the forecast. So, essentially, the surplus that Delhi has recorded this month is a result of a single day’s rainfall,” a senior IMD official said.Experts said that such short, intense spells, which Delhi has been observing over the last decade, are not conducive for the city’s ecology.An analysis carried out by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) last year showed that this trend of short, but intense rain spells is making usable water scarce in Delhi. The analysis showed that between August 13 and August 19, 2020, the city’s rainfall produced enough wastewater to meet nearly 13% of the daily water demand.In this period, Delhi received nearly 118.4mm of rainfall —143% more than the average. Such a heavy spell can produce around 87,000 million litres of water, the analysis showed. Apart from usable water going to waste, episodes of urban flooding and flash floods are also increasing because of this trend.Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) at the Skymet Weather Services, said: “We can explain the scenario with a small example; if we are thirsty we will benefit from drinking water at regular intervals. What happens if someone forcefully pours it down your throat? Your body’s natural reaction will be to spit out the excess. That is what is happening with nature too. Because these rains are excess, in short durations, they are not helping the ground water recharge. Water is just flooding into the city and going down the drain.”The Minto Bridge, which is an annual pain point for the Capital, was finally flooded on Saturday despite the authorities putting in place a new drainage mechanism there which had kept it dry during the rains over the past couple of months. Authorities barricaded the road below the bridge, where a man drowned last year.“The whole concept of modern day city planning is to adapt to an area’s natural circumstances. If rains are getting more intense and if population is increasing, then the infrastructure and it’s management will also have to adapt to it. We need a dedicated monsoon plan for the city, which addresses all aspects of the city – drainage, traffic, manpower management etc.,” said Sewa Ram from School of Planning and Architecture||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/intense-spells-of-rain-harming-delhi-s-ecology-101629659758570.html
23-08-2021||Mumbai||Personal Finance: How to plan for an early retirement||Planning retirement early is an art that wholly depends on how well you plan your finances to ensure fiscal independence. However, mere savings may not be enough given the rising inflation and expenses associated with a retired life bereft of any regular income. If you want to retire early, here are some thumb rules. Assess your expenses How much money you will need every month once you retire is more important than how much you spend now. Start with essential expenses on food, rent, clothing, transportation, insurance premiums and money needed for other utilities. Do not ignore loans that you may have taken, check your credit card debt and work towards paying off all your bills, debts, and loans. It is essential to plan for a debt-free retirement, which means no accumulation of bad debts or saving enough to repay off the long-term loans even after you retire. Also, a lot depends on how early you wish to retire. If you will still have dependent children after you retire, you must allocate a sum of money to pay towards premiums in life insurance policies and continuing health insurance plans. Money requirement Now that you have budgeted your post-retirement expenses, focus on how much money you would need to retire. There are no fixed ways to evaluate this though the thumb rule is to set aside at least 25-30 times your budgeted yearly expenses on retirement along with enough cash to cover at least a year’s worth of expenses. Estimating your needs when you’re 40 or 50 years would require you to find out how inflation affects daily living costs. For example, your monthly expenses are ₹20,000 at present that translate to ₹2,40,000 every year. Dividing ₹2,40,000 by four per cent equals to ₹60,00,000 per annum. This means that you would need ₹60, 00,000 every year after you have retired. Save and invest regularly Financial planning is futile without timely action. You must start saving early to ensure enough funds when you retire. However, saving alone will not help and, hence, you must choose from among the different investment options -- shares, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, sovereign gold bonds, crypto currencies, real estate, fixed deposits, recurring deposit accounts, post office schemes, corporate bonds -- available to allocate your money in a way that yields you enough funds when required. The idea is to see your money grow. Active management of investments Investing money and then forgetting it is a deadly financial sin. Track your investments and check if your portfolio is diversified enough. For example, you can put your money in high-performing equity mutual funds or stocks if you are willing to take risks and wish to accumulate a large corpus after 15-20 years. However, if you are a conservative investor and cannot handle the turbulent nature of the stock movement, approach debt funds that earn higher returns than bank deposits sans the risk of losing your investments. The real estate market is expected to boom with the market now opening to new business and employment opportunities post the Covid-19 pandemic. With home loan rates at an all-time low, it would make sense to invest in property now to sell it at a higher price later. To save on the money spent on payment of medical bills and expenses associated with both pre-and post-hospitalisation, you must buy proper health insurance that will take care of your treatment expenditure. Last, but not least, never underestimate the importance of a term insurance plan, which would ensure financial security for your dependents after your death. Choose a term cover amount after considering your nominees’ financial needs and your debts, if any. This is especially true if you have taken a loan that must then be taken care of by your nominees.

23-08-2021||Mumbai||Eknath Shinde: Narayan Rane is trying to create confusion within MVA||Senior Shiv Sena leader and state urban development department minister Ekanth Shinde has said that Union minister Narayan Rane’s remarks were baseless and he was trying to create confusion with Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government (MVA). During the Jan Ashirwad Yatra on Saturday, Rane had said that Shinde was fed up with the Shiv Sena as he has no freedom in taking decisions. “Shinde is fed up with the Sena as he has to ask Matroshee (chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s residence) before signing any file. He is in trouble in the Sena. If he approaches us [Bharatiya Janata Party], we will induct him in our party,” the Union minister said. On Sunday, Shinde said that he has full freedom in his department and there was no interference from the CM or any Sena leader. “I am happy in my party. Whatever Rane said was in an attempt to create confusion within MVA government. BJP leaders have been doing it since beginning of the formation of MVA government. I have full freedom in the government. CM Uddhavji Thackeray has final word in any department as is the case in any government,” Shinde said at Gadchiroli. He also said MVA government was doing a good job and that he has been taking decisions related to his department independently. “Be it the decision related to the Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi Expressway or the Unified Development Control Rules, my department has been working independently. Rane, who has been a Maharashtra CM, would know the hierarchy in decision-making and as a Union minister. He, too, would be answerable to the Prime Minister while taking any policy decision,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/eknath-shinde-narayan-rane-is-trying-to-create-confusion-within-mva-101629659602655.html

23-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra minister: Proposal for welfare of orphaned kids pending, deputy CM not cooperating||Congress has once again complained of the secondary treatment in Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. Senior party leader and women and child development (WCD) minister Yashomati Thakur has trained gun at deputy chief minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar for not releasing funds for the schemes related to her department and echoed the dissident voice raised earlier by her other cabinet colleagues. Thakur said that a proposal to increase the grant given to the orphaned and the children who have lost either of their parents is pending with the finance department for months. She said that the deputy chief and finance minister Ajit Pawar was not cooperating with her the way he should. She raised the issue during a public meeting in Akola, in the presence of the revenue minister and Congress’s legislative party leader Balasaheb Thorat. “The grant given for the upbringing of the children who have lost one or both parents have been recently increased to ₹1,125 from ₹450. We wish to further increase it to ₹2,500. The proposal is pending with the chief minister and deputy chief minister. The deputy chief minister has not been cooperating with us the way he should have,” Thakur said. She also requested Thorat to look into it. Under the scheme, 17,845 children who have lost both or either of their parents get ₹1,125 a month for their upbringing. The grant is given to the family or relatives who take care of these children. Another 15,000 such children have been added to the category amid the Covid-19 pandemic due to the deaths of their parents. According to the officials from WCD, the proposal is to increase the amount further by ₹2,500 for the better maintenance of these children. “It has been moved almost two months ago, after which a couple of meetings were held. The finance department is not positive about the proposal as the annual burden is expected to go up to ₹40 crore from around ₹20 crore. The finance department has asked for the information from all other departments on similar schemes to avoid duplicity,” the official said. This is not the first time that any Congress minister has spoken about the secondary treatment by the three-party government. Senior Congress leaders and ministers like Thorat, Ashok Chavan, Vijay Wadettiwar had expressed their discontent openly over the release of funds to the local bodies the party control. Chavan had said last year the municipal councils and district council under them did not get development funds. Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole had last month in Lonavala attacked Ajit Pawar for undermining Congress leaders in Pune. He had later retracted his statement. NCP Member of Parliament Supriya Sule said that there is nothing to read anything into it. “There no other meaning to what Yashomatitai has said. The finance department had released ₹5 lakh for the Balsangopan scheme in the past. The MVA government is sensitive about the issues related to children. I am sure the demand will soon be complied with,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-minister-proposal-for-welfare-of-orphaned-kids-pending-deputy-cm-not-cooperating-101629659479353.html
23-08-2021||Chandigarh||Capt slams Sidhu’s advisers over remarks on Kashmir, Pak||Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Sunday took strong exception to the recent statements of two of Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu’s advisers on sensitive national issues like Kashmir and Pakistan, warning them against “atrocious and ill-conceived” comments that were potentially dangerous to the peace and stability of the state and the country. The CM urged Sidhu’s advisers to stick to giving advice to the PPCC president and not speak on matters of which they clearly had little or no knowledge, and had no understanding of the implications of their comments. He was reacting to reported remarks of Dr Pyare Lal Garg questioning his (Captain Amarinder’s) criticism of Pakistan, as well as the earlier controversial statement of Malwinder Singh Mali on Kashmir. Both of them were recently appointed by Sidhu as his advisers. Amarinder expressed shock at the extraordinary statements of Mali and Garg, which, he said, were totally misplaced and antagonistic to the stated position of India and the Congress on Pakistan and Kashmir. He urged the Punjab Congress president to rein in his advisers before they end up doing more damage to India’s interests. “Kashmir was and is an inalienable part of India,” he said, adding that with his proclamation to the contrary, Mali had effectively and inexplicably toed Islamabad’s line. “This is totally anti-national,” he said, also slamming Mali for failing to withdraw his statement despite the widespread condemnation it had evoked not only from other parties but also from within the Congress. Ridiculing Garg’s statement that criticism of Pakistan by him (Amarinder) was not in the interest of Punjab, the CM said he was clearly disconnected from the ground reality. “The fact, which every Punjabi and in fact every Indian knows, is that Pakistan’s threat to us is real. Every day, the neighbouring country is pushing weapons and drugs into Punjab via drones in a brazen attempt to destabilise our state, and our nation. Punjabi soldiers are dying at the borders at the hands of Pak-backed forces,” he added. The CM said Garg might have forgotten the thousands of Punjabi lives lost in the fire of Pak-backed terrorism of the 1980s and 1990s, but he had not, nor have the people of Punjab. “And we will continue to do everything in our power to fight off Pakistan’s dangerous games,” asserted Amarinder, urging Garg not to undermine the sacrifices of Punjabis with his irresponsible and patently politically motivated statements.Veteran Cong leader takes up matter with Sonia Congress leader and veteran trade unionist MM Singh Cheema has taken up PPCC chief’s adviser Malvinder Singh Mali’s recent media utterances with AICC president Sonia Gandhi, stating that these seriously compromised the party’s stand.Cheema said he had lodged a strong protest against the appointment of these “so-called” advisers to PPCC president while knowing their past stands on critical issues. These successive appointments without wider consultation and approval of the Central leadership were bound to create an avoidable mess, he said in a statement. The Congress leader said that Punjab had faced a major brunt during the height of militancy and people with overnight elevation may not understand the pain of traditional Congressmen on nationalist issues. “There are certain norms and precedents which need to be respected by every responsible Congressman and just escapist silence on certain issues is not at all welcomed, it is high time to set the record straight and all these appointments made in last 30 days be dispensed with to start afresh,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-slams-sidhu-s-advisers-over-remarks-on-kashmir-pak-101629659419174.html

A total of 14,037,839 citizens have been fully vaccinated.Dr Ramaswami N, commissioner, family welfare, and director, National Health Mission, said that vaccine allocation is a dynamic process and given according to the needs of a region. “There is a set formula where various factors like positivity rates as well as performance as well as backlog is taken into consideration and the vaccines are allotted,” said Ramaswami.Ramaswami denied any discrimination or bias in the entire process. “In cities like Mumbai and Pune, the private sector is very active and they contribute to this number,” he added.Dr Gilada, secretary general, Organised Medicine Academic Guild, said that state needs to adopt a smart policy with regards to vaccination. “Since there is shortage of vaccines, first the vulnerable section should be targeted. If the people in backward regions are resisting, then efforts must be made to encourage them. It should be a holistic approach as there is lot of intra-state movement,” said Gilada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-4-141-fresh-covid-19-cases-one-death-in-mumbai-101629659244006.html

Other Afghan Sikhs evacuated are said to be relatives and close associates of both the parliamentarians. While 24 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus have been evacuated, around 260 Sikhs and Hindus are still waiting to be airlifted. “They (MPs) have solved their purpose, but they did not take care of us. They should have ensured evacuation of other community members first,” said a Sikh, who was part of the group that was not allowed by Taliban to board the evacuation flight of India on Friday and Saturday.Another Sikh said: “The way the MPs have left the country was not fair and the sangat is not happy with them.” However, some other members of the minority communities are hoping that they will also be evacuated soon. “We have been told by Gurdwara Karta-E-Parwan president Gurnam Singh that he is in contact with some officials and representatives of international organisations and we will also be evacuated soon,” said another Sikh.“We convinced them to let us save their lives first. Very painful to leave behind your legacy, business and become a refugee,” said Vikramjit Singh Sahney, philanthropist and World Punjabi Organisation (WPO) president, as 168 Afghanistan evacuees reach India.Meanwhile, United Sikhs, the Supreme Sikh Society of New Zealand and the Gurdwara Guru Nanak Darbar (GGND), London, UK, wrote to the New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Kate Laurell Ardern urging her to resettle Afghan Sikhs and Hindus, who are fleeing the country.“We have chosen to write to you because of your reputation and track record for swinging into action where only eagles dare, an attribute admired by all,” was stated in the letter, signed by Mejindarpal Kaur, international legal director of the United Sikhs, Jaswinder Singh Nagra, president of the SSSNZ and Davinder Singh, trustee of GGND.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sikhs-taking-refuge-at-kabul-gurdwara-angry-at-two-mps-for-leaving-them-behind-101629659239215.html

23-08-2021||Noida||GB Nagar health department to administer 12,150 vaccine doses on Monday||The Gautam Budh Nagar health department on Sunday said that it has decided to accelerate the Covid-19 vaccination drive in the district that has been facing shortage of vaccine for the past few weeks. Officials said that a total of 12,150 doses will be administered at 27 government-run Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) on Monday. According to the officials, in the coming seven days (from August 23-28), more than 80,000 doses will be administered at various CVCs across the district.GB Nagar chief medical officer, Dr Sunil Sharma, said that the health department has planned to inoculate more people than last week. “In the last week (August 16-21), we administered 76,124 vaccine doses, which was more than double of 30,526 doses in the earlier week (August 9-14). We hope that the vaccination figures will go up in the coming weeks,” he said. The officials said that the district hospital in Sector 30 and the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida will administer 1,500 doses each on Monday.“Apart from primary health centres (PHCs) and community health centres (CHCs), the vaccination centres will also be stationed at some government schools in the district,” Sharma said. Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district immunisation officer, said that at present, the district health department is left with around 25,000 doses of vaccines. “With the available stock, we can run the drive for two more days. However, we’ve sent our requisition for vaccines to the state government and will get adequate supply on Monday. After that, we’ll be able to restart the drive in the district at full swing,” he said. It may be noted that during the single-day mega vaccination drive on August 3, there were 200 CVCs in the district. On August 4, the number came down to 42 and after that it reduced to only 16 on August 7. Now, as the supply of vaccines has increased, the number of vaccination centres are also increasing accordingly, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-health-department-to-administer-12-150-vaccine-doses-on-monday-101629659000662.html
23-08-2021||Noida||Noida police launch beat policing system for women personnel||The Gautam Budh Nagar police on Saturday launched the beat policing system for women police personnel as part of third phase of ‘Mission Shakti’ in Greater Noida. The women constables have been allotted beats within their jurisdiction, senior officials said, adding that the move is aimed at improving women’s safety in the district.Vrinda Shukla, deputy commissioner of police (women safety), GB Nagar, said that the police department has started women beat policing from Jarcha police station area. “The women police personnel have been assigned areas and asked to make a coordination with the local women. They will listen to women’s problems and address them. They will also inform their seniors in cases related to women safety,” she said. Shukla said that the system will strengthen communication between police and people, and women will be able to express themselves more comfortably. The officials said that an event was organised for launching the third phase at Santhali village in Jarcha that was attended by GB Nagar police commissioner Alok Singh and Dadri MLA Tejpal Nagar. In beat policing, police personnel are deployed in their respective areas for a specific time period each day to meet residents in that particular area and cultivate sources and strengthen the policing network. The UP government’s ‘Mission Shakti’ campaign focuses on ensuring safety and dignity of women in the state. The first phase of the programme was launched by the state government in October 2020, while the second phase started in March last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-police-launch-beat-policing-system-for-women-personnel-101629659000172.html
23-08-2021||Noida||Traffic jams continue for second day in Ghaziabad||The woes of commuters in the city continued on Sunday as several major roads like GT Road at Mohan Nagar and a stretch of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway near Lal Kuan witnessed long hours of traffic jams due to waterlogging. The situation has prevailed in the city since Saturday morning after heavy rains that continued on Sunday morning. “I had to travel from Karhera to my home at Rajendra Nagar, a distance of about 4km that usually takes 10-15 minutes. But, the long jams created a bottleneck near Mohan Nagar intersection, and it took me more than an hour to reach home,” said Jatin Kumar, a resident of Rajendra Nagar. He said that long jams were also witnessed on GT Road and at the underpass near Sahibabad railway station. Similarly, the Delhi-Meerut Expressway stretch at Lal Kuan, which is witnessing the construction of 16-lane rail over bridge (ROB) near ABES College, witnessed a chaotic traffic situation on Sunday. “I generally travel about 7km to Kavi Nagar from Vijay Nagar. It took me about two hours to cross the ROB and almost an hour when I travelled back home on my motorcycle. The waterlogging and muck on the road created problems for the commuters,” said Pradeep Kumar, a Vijay Nagar resident. Gauging the situation, officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said that they temporarily opened up four new lanes of the under construction ROB in order to ease the traffic. “Earlier, there were four lanes. With the four more lanes opened temporarily, the commuters now have four lanes to go to Delhi and four others to reach Ghaziabad,” said an NHAI officer requesting anonymity. Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic), said that all the personnel of the traffic police as well as police post in-charges were helping out in managing the traffic situation. “The traffic jams on Sunday were a result of waterlogging that is getting cleared. The NHAI temporarily opened up new lanes in order to ease traffic situation. Our personnel were deployed at major stretches on Sunday as well to manage the traffic,” he added. The Ghaziabad municipal corporation on Saturday identified 13 heavily waterlogged areas and deployed a team of three officers for each area for round the clock monitoring of the situation. They were tasked to monitor and get cleared the waterlogged areas. Despite repeated attempts, municipal commissioner MS Tanwar could not be contacted on Sunday for his comments. Meanwhile, the NHAI officials said that the six new lanes of the ROB are likely to be opened by August 30 this year. “We have completed the load testing of the new lanes. The six new lanes will be opened up officially by August 30. This will give 10 lanes to commuters and ease up pressure,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/traffic-jams-continue-for-second-day-in-ghaziabad-101629658999596.html
23-08-2021||Chandigarh||Afghan Sikh lawmaker breaks down after reaching India, says everything is finished||“All achievements of the last 20 years in Afghanistan have been lost. Nothing is left. It’s zero now,” said Afghan lawmaker Narender Singh Khalsa soon after his arrival along with 167 others at the Hindon airbase on Sunday as part of India’s evacuation mission from Taliban besieged Kabul.Khalsa and senator Anarkali Honaryar as well as their families were among those flown out of Kabul in a C-17 heavy-lift aircraft of the Indian Air Force (IAF) on Sunday morning.The Sikh lawmaker thanked the Indian government for rescuing him, his family and several other members of his community following the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul and most parts of Afghanistan.“India is our second home. Even if we are Afghans and live in that country, people often call us Hindustanis,” the lawmaker told reporters at the airbase near Delhi.Asked about the current situation in Afghanistan and how he felt about the latest developments in the country, Khalsa, with tears in his eyes, said all the gains of the past 20 years have been undone.“I feel like crying. Everything is finished. It is a very difficult and painful decision to leave the country. We have not seen such a situation. Everything has been snatched away. It’s all over,” he said.The Taliban took control of Kabul and almost all major cities and provinces of Afghanistan 20 years after it was ousted by a US-led military coalition following the 9/11 attacks.Recalling the harrowing experience of the past seven days after the Taliban took control of Kabul, Khalsa said the situation is “very bad” and appealed to the Indian government to rescue the remaining stranded Hindus and Sikhs from the war-torn country.“Situation is very bad. We had to face a lot of difficulties. Thank God for saving our lives as we had to face harrowing times in the last few days. My expectation from the Indian government is that all those who are still stuck are brought back,” he said.“The Taliban used to ask us to remain in Afghanistan saying your security is our responsibility. As there are so many groups of Taliban, we do not know whom to speak to and whom to believe. That’s why we decided to leave as the situation is serious,” he added. Khalsa said almost all Indians and Afghan Sikhs were taking shelter at gurdwaras in Kabul and elsewhere and that some 200 other Indians and Indian-origin people are waiting to be rescued.“The gurdwaras are serving people by providing shelter and food. We are worried about our people who are still staying there,” he said.Asked about the brief detention of Indians and the Afghan Sikhs and Hindus on Saturday by the Taliban when they were on their way to the Kabul airport, he said all of them had to face harrowing experiences.“They separated us from the Indians...In each of the gates at the airport, 5,000-6,000 people were standing. Initially, we could not go inside,” he said. “A person from Taliban harassed us. Then we left the place and came to a gurdwara. Our Indian friends were also harassed. It was difficult to understand who was a good person and who was bad. Then around 8pm, we entered the airport by a VIP entry point,” he added.Khalsa said the temples and gurdwaras in Afghanistan are unharmed and safe so far.India on Sunday brought back nearly 400 people, including 329 of its nationals, in three different flights as part of its efforts to evacuate its citizens from Kabul.A total of 168 people, including 107 Indians and 23 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus, were flown from Kabul to Hindon airbase near Delhi in a C-17 heavy-lift military transport aircraft of the IAF. Another group of 87 Indians and two Nepalese nationals were brought back in a special Air India flight from Dushanbe, a day after they were evacuated to the Tajikistan capital in an IAF aircraft, officials said.Separately, a group of 135 Indians who were earlier evacuated from Kabul to Doha in the last few days by the US and NATO aircraft, were flown back from Doha to Delhi on a special flight, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/afghan-sikh-lawmaker-breaks-down-after-reaching-india-says-everything-is-finished-101629658999152.html

This time it is not only the top leadership of the constituent parties which has been invited for consultations but the middle rung leadership as well,” he said.The leader said it has been left to the alliance parties to select the party leaders for the meeting. “The participants will be from the length and breadth of the Valley and we expect around 150-200 leaders to take part in the meeting,” he said. The meeting has been called to discuss the prevailing situation in Jammu and Kashmir and “have wider consultations on various issues,” he said.“It (the meeting) will discuss the way forward and it is the first such attempt in Kashmir by the alliance to get a broader perspective on the issues. We wanted to have this kind of consultation before but factors like Covid prevented such a gathering,” the leader added.Meanwhile, the National Conference (NC) on Saturday denounced the jibe taken by the People’s Conference at a meeting of Opposition parties convened by Congress president Sonia Gandhi as “unfounded and out of sync with reality”.The People’s Conference said the leaders from Jammu and Kashmir should either get the national Opposition to endorse the demand for restoration of Article 370 so that there is some hope in the future or just keep out of the united platform.CENTRE NOT AFRAID OF MUFTI’S FALSE THREATS: VIJAYVARGIYAINDORE Slamming former J&K CM and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti over her demand to restore Article 370 in the UT, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya on Sunday said the Centre is not afraid of Mufti’s false threats.Vijayvargiya said people of J&K have recognised her real face of Mufti.Vijayvargiya said, “Centre does not care about Mehbooba Mufti’s false threats.

23-08-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: 7 pm at Barakhamba||The evening sky is stained in pale but pellucid pink. Such a gauzy shade materialises only by the chance entwining of the monsoon clouds with the setting sun. Meanwhile, birds are wheeling about in the air. Down under, humans are mechanically going about their business.This 7 pm scene at Barakhamba traffic light in central Delhi’s Connaught Place rivals the sunsets of mountains and seas. The area’s sights-cum-sounds are vividly conveying the poignancies of a worn-out city in sundown. Conveniently for the spectator, the sidewalk besides the traffic light, at the mouth of M Block in Outer Circle, happens to have a small seating facility. It is an idyllic location to immerse in the ambiance of the moment.The theatrical sky above is claimed by two groups of birds—one is circling around the multi-storey Gopaldas Bhawan; the other is circling around the multi-storey Statesman House. Both towers face each other like hostile powers. The two groups of birds too are seeming to confront each other in that same unfriendly spirit, but stage an abrupt retreat, flying back to their respective territories. Only to start the same tension-filled drama again.Meanwhile, quite a few pedestrians are settling down into the sidewalk seats, like a passenger drifting towards an unoccupied chair in an airport lounge. (Oblivious to the world around them, they are staring at their mobile phone screens.)Now a middle-aged man in pants and a full-sleeve shirt stops by the traffic light, probably waiting for it to turn red so that he can cross to N Block. The masked gent is holding a leather laptop bag in one hand and a lunchbox in another. His shoulders are stooped, a belly is loosely popping out of his otherwise gaunt figure. The Statesman Tower stands directly behind him, looking like a genie that has suddenly emerged out of Alladin’s lamp. The traffic light changes. The man walks ahead, his face down. A lively young couple overtakes him in quick steps, they are holding hands.Half an hour later the sky turns black. A beggar occupies a corner of the seating space and starts to eat a half-eaten cake that a passerby gave him moments back. The atmosphere of the place becomes sombre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-7-pm-at-barakhamba-101629658688580.html
23-08-2021||Other||PDP’s Parra moves HC, wants FIR registered by police quashed||Senior PDP leader and close aide of former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti Waheed-ur-Rehman Parra has approached the Jammu and Kashmir high court for quashing of an FIR against him by the J&K Police, citing violation of fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution and similarity of charges also being probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).In the petition, Parra’s counsel Shariq Reyaz submitted that his client was investigated for the same offences by the NIA as well as the Counter Intelligence Kashmir (CIK)) wing of J&K Police separately, which is in violation of laid down norms under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).Justice Vinod Chatterji Koul, after hearing arguments on the petition challenging the framing of charges in the police case by a designated court last month, had issued notice to the CIK last week for filing its response within a month.Reyaz drew a table in his petition of the two FIRs and two charge sheets filed by the NIA and the CIK to draw similarities in the offences being investigated by the two probe agencies separately.In his petition, the counsel termed the framing of charges by the designated court in Srinagar on the charge sheet filed by the CIK a “mechanical exercise” and referred to judgments of the Supreme Court “wherein a word of caution has been administered to the trial courts to carefully examine the evidence and after analysing the same frame charge under the rigorous scheme of UAPA”.The counsel also mentioned that the FIR by the CIK is “clearly tainted with the vice of malice in law, having been registered only to attain a collateral purpose of detaining the petitioner (Parra) illegally and unlawfully being in blatant abuse of police power, violating with impunity the constitutional guarantees guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India”.Reyaz submitted before the HC that the “impugned investigation/ prosecution in the present case, if allowed to continue, would not only offend against the mandate of constitutional guarantee guaranteed to the petitioner under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India but is also sure to result into the grave miscarriage of justice”.“Therefore, to prevent the miscarriage of justice from being perpetuated the impugned FIR...as well as the impugned investigation initiated and commenced against the petitioner in pursuance thereto, is liable to be quashed”.Reyaz also challenged the sanction for prosecution, a mandatory requirement under the UAPA, given by the Home Secretary of Jammu and Kashmir, saying under the Reorganisation of Jammu and Kashmir Act of 2018, law and order is a subject of the Centre and the officer concerned is not competent to issue any such order. The designated court in July last had framed terror charges against Parra on a police chargesheet claiming that he was an asset for Pakistan-based terror groups and that his 13-year journey as a journalist and politician from 2007 was a “saga of subterfuge, deceit and double-dealing”. The eight-page order stated that “prima facie there is sufficient evidence against the accused for alleged commission of offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the Indian Penal Code”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pdps-parra-moves-hc-wants-fir-registered-by-police-quashed-101629658820081.html
23-08-2021||Other||Both factions of Hurriyat Conference likely to be banned under UAPA||A ban under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act may be imposed on both factions of the Hurriyat Conference which has been spearheading the separatist movement in Jammu and Kashmir for over two decades, officials said.They said a recent probe into the granting of MBBS seats to Kashmiri students by institutions in Pakistan indicates that the money collected from aspirants by some organisations which were part of the Hurriyat Conference conglomerate was being used for funding terror organisations in the UT.The officials said both the factions of the Hurriyat are likely to be banned under Section 3(1) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, or the UAPA, under which “if the central government is of opinion that any association is, or has become, an unlawful association, it may, by notification in the official gazette, declare such association to be unlawful.”They said the proposal was mooted in accordance with the Centre’s policy of zero tolerance against terrorism. The Hurriyat Conference came into existence in 1993 with 26 groups, including some pro-Pakistan and banned outfits such as the Jamaat-e-Islami, JKLF and the Dukhtaran-e-Millat. It also included the People’s Conference and the Awami Action Committee headed by Mirwaiz Umer Farooq. The separatist conglomerate broke into two factions in 2005 with the moderate group being led by the Mirwaiz and the hard-line headed by Syed Ali Shah Geelani. So far, the Centre has banned the Jamaat-e-Islami and the JKLF under the UAPA. The ban was imposed in 2019. The officials said a probe into funding of terror groups indicated alleged involvement of secessionist and separatist leaders, including the members and cadres of the Hurriyat Conference who have been acting in connivance with active militants of proscribed terrorist organisations Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM), Dukhtaran-e-Millat (DeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). The cadres raised funds in the country and from abroad through various illegal channels, including hawala, for funding separatist and terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir, they said. The funds collected were used for “causing disruption in Kashmir by way of pelting stones on security forces, systematically burning schools, damaging public property and waging war against India as part of a criminal conspiracy,” they claimed. Supporting the case for banning the two factions of the Hurriyat Conference under the UAPA, the officials cited several cases related to terror funding, including the one being probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in which several of the conglomerate’s cadres were arrested and jailed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/both-factions-of-hurriyat-conference-likely-to-be-banned-under-uapa-101629658579082.html

He worked as a housekeeping supervisor in the hospital for the last few months, said police.OP Singh, commissioner of police, said the suspect asked her to follow him “for some urgent work regarding her father’s treatment” while she was returning from the washroom. “He raped her and fled from the spot.

We registered the case under Pocso (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act, teams were formed within minutes and medical examination of the victim was conducted,” he said.Police said Geeta, inspector from the women’s police station in Sector 16, also reached the spot along with her team and the crime branch.Singh said the suspect was identified through the CCTV footage with the help of hospital staff. “The teams arrested him within hours based on human intelligence and technical surveillance. He was sent to judicial custody on Sunday,” he said.The police is examining his past records to see if he was involved in any other criminal incidents.

Police said crime investigation units are also conducting raids at different locations based on technical and human intelligence. A 36-year-old woman, Imrana, was stabbed to death allegedly by an acquaintance at a hotel in Sector 14 after they had checked into a room on Friday. In a purported video of the incident, which was shared widely on social media, the woman, who sustained 12 stab wounds, is seen chasing the man and later falls down a staircase. The hotel staff said that this is the first time such an incident has happened in the premises.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that they have not identified the suspect yet as the Aadhaar card and mobile number given at the reception were found to be fake. “The woman was a regular visitor to the hotel and had asked the suspect to book a room there. It seems the motive of the suspect was to kill her and that is the reason why he attacked her within minutes and fled. In the entire 25 minutes within the hotel and inside the room, the suspect did not remove his face mask,” he said. Imrana’s husband Mohammad Shahid said they have three children. “My relatives and I had come to Agra for cremation. We are also trying to find out the suspect’s identity through the last calls received on her phone,” Shahid said. Sangwan said they are also scanning the call details of the victim. “We are checking CCTV footage from different locations. The auto driver picked up the suspect from Iffco Chowk around 7.45pm. The victim had already boarded the auto but then he switched off her mobile phone while on the way to the hotel,” he said.

The administration is also contemplating staggered re-opening of educational institutions where the staff and students are fully vaccinated. The Covid-19 situation was reviewed in a meeting chaired by chief secretary Arun Kumar Mehta on Friday. In an order on Sunday, Mehta said there was a need to continue with the existing Covid containment measures in all the districts in view of the “uneven trend in daily infections”. “The maximum number of people permitted to attend any indoor or outdoor gathering shall be 25,” said Mehta who is also the chairman of the state executive committee (SEC). The order said Block Diwas shall resume in all the districts subject to the ceiling of 25 people only with due compliance of Covid-appropriate behaviour. “Necessary modifications in the conduct of the event may accordingly be made by the district magistrates concerned,” the order said. “The night curfew shall continue to remain in force in all the districts from 8pm to 7am,” it said. Jammu and Kashmir administration on July 25 had lifted the weekend curfew from all the districts.The order reiterated that while all the schools, colleges and coaching centres will continue to remain closed for on-site and in-person teaching, the educational institutions are permitted to seek attendance of vaccinated staff for administrative purposes.“The government shall consider phased re-opening of institutions where 100% vaccination of staff and students has been achieved,” the order said. The deputy commissioners have been asked to focus on the positivity rate in their respective medical blocks and intensify management and restriction of activities. “There shall be renewed focus on panchayat-level mapping of cases and effective micro-containment zones shall be constituted wherever unusual spike of cases is noticed,” it said.The officials have been asked to also focus on second dose vaccination. “Intensive vaccination drives shall be taken up in all districts to ensure timely second dose, besides covering vulnerable groups for first dose,” the order stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-curbs-to-stay-for-another-week-in-j-k-block-diwas-events-to-resume-101629658282515.html
23-08-2021||Mumbai||Tunnel projects near Mumbai’s SGNP made U-turn on green nod?||Two key infrastructure projects – the twin-tunnel link roads between Goregaon-Mulund and Thane-Borivli – which will pass under the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), are expected to begin construction within the next year. Both the projects have been exempted from carrying out a precautionary environmental impact assessment (EIA) study.Publicly available documents, however, show that this was not the case initially. Both the projects had separately applied to the Union environment ministry in 2017, seeking environment clearance (EC) for ‘Category-A’ projects. Unlike Category-B projects, these require mandatory public hearings, an EIA report and scrutiny by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change’s (MoEFCC) expert appraisal committee (EAC).The projects, which are being executed by two different authorities, were subsequently delisted or rejected by MoEFCC on identical grounds: that the roads are not state or national highways, and hence do not require ECs.This move is within the ambit of the law, as road building as an activity is not covered under EIA Notification, 2006. But given the unique nature of these projects – the first ones wherein tunnels are being proposed under a protected area anywhere in the country – experts and environmentalists have been insisting on applicability of environmental clearances, in addition to clearance by the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL). Goregaon-Mulund Link Road (GMLR)The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had first applied to MoEFCC, seeking EC for GMLR project on June 29, 2017. The twin tunnels will pass through SGNP for a length of 4.7km and will occupy about 21 hectares of subterranean area under the national park. They are expected to reduce travel time between the eastern and western suburbs by an hour.In September2017, BMC had complied with certain conditions laid down by EAC and submitted additional details as part of this regulatory process. The Terms of Reference (ToR) were obtained in January 2018. It was only in April 2018 that the matter was delisted by the Union environment ministry, essentially exempting it from EC and thus an EIA as well.Documents show that this was done at BMC’s behest. In the minutes of their 187th meeting – held on April 12, 2018 – EAC noted, “As the proponent did not provide correct information at the time of submission of online application, the ministry considered the proposal and issued ToR. However, now the proponent has informed that the said project does not require prior EC because it is only a development plan road of BMC and does not even form part of any expressway or state/national highway.”The exemption has also allowed BMC to skip certain essential conditions and studies which had otherwise been imposed by MoEFCC. These include a public hearing, a cumulative impact assessment of all the projects being planned within, around and through SGNP and a separate study on the project’s impact on Tulsi and Vihar lakes, which are about a kilometre away from the tunnels’ proposed alignment.“By allowing this project to be positioned as a development road, the ministry has in turn allowed BMC to bypass essential safeguards. The tunnels are still within the boundary of a protected area, and so should mandatorily be treated as a Category-A project. This is not just a development road, but a fairly sophisticated infrastructure project that will pollute and disturb one of the city’s last remaining silent zones. It is a situation unique to Mumbai because no other city is planning to disturb the protected areas for the sake of private car owners,” said Stalin D, director of non-governmental organisation (NGO) Vanashakti.An official with BMC’s bridges department, seeking anonymity of name, pointed out that the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) has been appointed to conduct a three-year study of the project’s impact at the instruction of NBWL, and that possible impact on the aquifers of Tulsi and Vihar lakes have been duly considered. “The only alternative to tunnels is an above ground road, and that would be more damaging to SGNP. Any disturbance is temporary, and does not warrant an EIA in case of GMLR,” the official said.Borivli-Thane Link RoadA similar sequence of events can be observed in the case of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority’s (MMRDA) Borivli-Thane twin-tunnels’ project, which is around 8kms in length and runs parallel to GMLR, toward the northern end of SGNP.The project had sought EC from MoEFCC in November 2017, when it was being executed by the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC). At the time, MoEFCC pointed out: “As per the information furnished by you the present proposal is not national highway / expressway or state highway. Hence, the present proposal is not admissible under EIA Notification, 2006.”In response, MRDSC insisted that the project should be considered under the same. “The applicability of environmental clearance is justified as the project alignment is passing through SGNP and traverses 153m away from Tungareshwar Wildlife Sanctuary and 900m away from the boundary of Karnala bird sanctuary and also falls within the protected radius of Matheran eco-sensitive zone.”In this case, it was the Union ministry which declined to accept this justification, and ToR for the project was never eventually granted. In September 2018, MSRDC swapped the project with MMRDA and instead took over the construction of the Virar-Alibag multi-modal corridor (which will also pass through SGNP).An MSRDC executive engineer, seeking anonymity of name, said, “We applied for EC because the project is situated in an ecologically fragile zone and there is bound to be some disturbance to wildlife because of the tunnelling and vibrations. This was not accepted by the ministry, and so the project fell outside the scope of EC.”A forest department official, who has previously served in a senior position at SGNP, not wishing to be identified, said, “Like the way BNHS is doing a survey around GMLR, the Wildlife Institute of India is being considered for a similar study along the Borivli-Thane tunnel.Cumulative impact study requiredEnvironmentalists and citizens have argued that instead of piecemeal clearances, authorities need to assess the cumulative impact of both the link roads on the larger ecology of SGNP, as had been recommended by MoEFCC in case of GMLR.They pointed out that the Virar-Alibag multi-modal corridor and the Delhi-Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) dedicated freight corridor will also pass through the national park, and while ECs for those have been granted separately, there has been no attempt from the state government to find out what the combined effects of these developments will be.“It is not enough to just look at each project and appraise it in isolation. What is their combined zone of influence? What risks do they pose in relation to one another? An independent body needs to assess all this before construction work is allowed. It is bizarre that both the link road projects applied for EC, but neither process led to an EIA. It calls into question the role of the Union ministry, which has allowed this to happen,” said Stalin D. Despite repeated attempts, G Mallikarjuna, chief conservator of forests, SGNP, did not respond to calls and messages, seeking comment for this story.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/tunnel-projects-near-mumbai-s-sgnp-made-u-turn-on-green-nod-101629658279201.html

In today’s time, the importance of measuring noise pollution is increasing by the day. We have now decided to start monitoring noise pollution in Gurugram, followed by Faridabad, and then other districts.”The official further said that with the data, they will generate awareness about noise pollution among citizens and the impact it has. According to HSPCB officials, noise pollution measuring devices will be installed at five locations in the district, mostly in areas with heavy traffic movement or footfall. The agency is yet to identify the locations.After studying the data, officials said, the pollution control board, with the help of experts, will form strategies on how to control it. At present, noise pollution levels in the city are measured only during Diwali.According to the Central Pollution Control Board, permissible noise levels around a residential area is 55 decibels (dBA) during the day and 45 decibels at night. For industrial areas, the permissible limit is 75 dBA during day and 70 dBA at night. In silence zones, that is an area of 100 metres around hospitals, educational institutions, courts, and religious places, noise levels shouldn’t exceed 50 dBA during the day and 40 dBA at night. In June this year, the National Green Tribunal, while hearing a petition, observed that a noise-free environment is part of the right to life and its violation is a criminal offence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/haryana-pcb-project-to-measure-noise-levels-in-gurugram-faridabad-101629658099983.html

Directions have been issued to all departments asking them to upload databases with employee details on a portal for which links have been provided to department heads. This step marks the beginning of the larger process,” said a senior government official.The circular mentions that the Delhi government will use the SPARROW -- smart performance appraisal report recording online window -- portal which was developed and implemented across departments by the central government in 2019. It further mentions about a series of meetings starting January 11 in which all department heads were briefed about the process.Delhi government has a collective strength of around 400,000 employees across all its departments which includes finance, administration, revenue, education, health, transport, planning, home, urban development, environment, social welfare, power, water, public works, food and art & culture among others.“It is a larger part of the government’s paperless governance policy. If a paperless budget could be tables in the assembly then why not paperless performance review of employees, which is traditionally an annual affair? Its importance was highlighted by the difficulties witnessed during the Covid-19 pandemic,” said a second senior government official.From this year, the Delhi government also made it mandatory for employees to fill in their health details -- with details on surgeries and annual health check up assessment details -- in the annual performance review form.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-put-digital-performance-review-system-in-place-for-its-staff-101629657979584.html

Police said the victim, Sector 37C resident Mukul, was formerly acquainted with the two suspects, Nikhil and Doni, and the alleged assault was the result of a tiff regarding another common friend.According to police, the suspects allegedly forced him at gunpoint to drive his scooter to an isolated stretch, where they hit him with a metal knuckle punch and bricks and stones on Friday night.

23-08-2021||Delhi||NCR village’s prehistoric roots fade into obscurity||A vortex of unpaved streets, with overflowing sewage, leads to the heart of the Anangpur village in Faridabad, located around 30 kilometres from the national capital. Teeming with people, queries regarding the village’s historical significance draw blank stares from all quarters. Haryana’s first Palaeolithic site was discovered in the village in 1986, a memory that barely a handful recollect.Excavations in the village by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in 1991 also unearthed tools from the late Acheulean period.Experts said that evidence from the lower to upper Paleolithic Age was found in Anangpur, and that late Acheulian tools belonging to the lower Paleolithic period were discovered here, and with the recent discovery of cave paintings and tools from the Upper Palaeolithic age in the Aravalli ranges, there is a renewed focus on the importance of granting protection to such pre-historic sites and increasing awareness about them. But residents of the village are mostly oblivious to Anangpur’s connections to the region’s prehistoric lineage.“There is no such site or connection to an excavation of this nature,” said Kashmiri. This is a common refrain from several middle-aged and elderly residents of the village, many of whom lived there during ASI’s investigations.“I don’t recall any such excavation that was undertaken here. We used to visit the mountains daily for labour but never heard about any discovery here,” said Savitri, an octogenarian resident, while sitting at the entrance of her house. Her neighbours nod in agreement and shift focus to the more contemporary issues plaguing the village.“Look at the broken roads here. The sewage is overflowing and there is no direct water supply. There is absolutely nothing to suggest here that an important historical finding took place here,” said Kashmiri, a woman in her 70s. Married at the age of 14, she has lived in the village for five decades now. “The generations before us might have seen something worthwhile, but all that we found were stones of no value,” said Kashmiri.The women are not alone. Despite being imbued in history that predates modern civilisation, awareness of the findings made by ASI remains scant among most residents, except those who were lucky to have witnessed the excavations nearly three decades ago.Gyan Chand, a 49-year-old, recalls watching the excavations as a curious teenager in the early 190s. He recalled how a team led by the ASI undertook extensive surveys and over two weeks.“Digging was carried out for nearly 15-20 days. They used to collect stones and take them every day. We were told that the tools demonstrated human evolution and were being sent to a lab,” said Chand.But, he added, the team never returned and the site was left unattended over the next three decades.“We never dwelled much on what followed but it’s worth pondering. What was the outcome of the excavations that were undertaken here? If the discovery was historically significant, why were there no follow-ups? It almost seems like the exercise never happened or was covered up. We never heard back anything about the site here and our village never became famous,” said Chand.Satveer, 42, another resident who faintly recalls the excavations, shared that he and many others thought the team was looking for treasure. He said that people’s interest waned as they realized that no such treasure was being searched. “Who cares about stones? We were under the impression that gold and silver were possibly hidden in the mountains. Once we realised that they were only looking for stones, people stopped caring,” recalls Satveer, who goes by his first name.Shyam Babu, who was 15 when the team visited, shared that the team was looking for some things in the vicinity of the already-existing fortifications in the area.“The team came every day for 15-20 days. They used to dig out stones. I don’t recall if they shared the significance of the stones. There are big boulder-like stones here even today. It seems that the place was used as a workshop by early humans, but one can’t be sure, because the team never came back. Most people don’t even recall the excavations now,’ said Babu, who used to accompany his grandfather to the site.While the site was discovered in 1986, ASI undertook excavation at the site in the early 90s. AK Sharma, who discovered the site, was accompanied by former joint director general of ASI SB Ota and other experts from ASI’s prehistoric branch.According to the report published by Sharma and Ota, the interesting feature noticed in Anangpur was that the working point of the handaxes was broken due to usage.The absence of abraded tools and occurrence of a large amount of waste products such as cores and flakes clearly suggest that the site at Anangpur was a habitation and factory of Early Man,” said the report, published in 1991.Ota said that while it was always known that there was a possibility of Acheulean sites in Aravalli, Anangpur was the first site where a large number of artifacts had been found. He, however, added that it was crucial to determine the significance of such sites.“If you look at the richness of the site, there are probably more than 1,000 sites that are better than Anangpur in the country. If you explore the complete Aravalli area, you may find more than 200 sites similar to Anangpur. Hence, it’s important to weigh the strategic importance since it’s not possible to grant protection to so many sites,” said Ota.Banani Bhattacharyya, deputy director of the Haryana department of archaeology and museums, said that the site was not under state protection. She said that it was crucial to understand that the approach towards conservation of pre-historic sites differed when compared to the protection proceedings that are undertaken for historic sites.“Pre-historic sites exist in a scattered manner. Since the individuals were hunter-gatherers, they used to travel over a huge area. It is not possible for us to grant protection to such sites based on contemporary boundaries unless the sites are concentrated in the same area,” said Bhattacharyya.She added that pre-historic sites required meticulous documentation due to which taking such sites under protection required a lot of time. “Each and everything needs to be meticulously documented. The processes take time. Documentation at Bhimbetka caves is taking place even today. The methodologies for conservation of pre-historic sites are slightly different. EverDespite multiple attempts, ASI officials could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/a-faridabad-village-s-prehistoric-roots-fade-into-obscurity-even-for-its-own-residents-101629657919343.html

Health department officials also said that the collection centres of the lab was allegedly not registered and did not maintain any records of the tests.Officials said three centres of the private lab -- in Gurugram sectors 63 and 14, and Rohini in Delhi -- were allegedly involved in the offences.Police said a case under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 34 (common intention) and 120 B (conspiracy) and several sections of the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of misuse ) (PCPNDT) Act, 1994, was registered at Sector 65 police station on Sunday. Deepak Kumar, station house officer of Sector 65 police station, said that this is for the first time that such a case has come to Gururgam police notice. “We have registered the case and suspects are yet to be arrested,” he said.The health department said a team of three doctors and a clerk -- constituted by Dr Virendra Yadav, civil surgeon, Gurugram -- investigated the lab’s alleged malpractices.The team sent a decoy patient to the lab which unveiled non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) -- a well-known genetic testing technique primarily meant for detecting genetic abnormalities in the foetus -- being conducted at the lab through their collection centres in Gurugram and Rohini in Delhi.Such testing can only be carried out as per conditions and guidelines laid down in the PC-PNDT Act, including being registered under the Act. Additionally, the Act mandates that the test can be conducted only on women who have undergone two abortions and are above the age of 35 years. The health department official said that the decoy sent to the lab was only 26 years old who had undergone just one abortion in the past.Medical officer at Patel Nagar urban primary health centre, Dr Umang, who goes by a single name, said that it is for the first time in the country that such a raid for NIPT was planned and executed successfully.Dr Umang said that the labs were charging between ₹15,000-25,000 for the unlawful tests. “We received secret information following which a team was constituted and a decoy customer who was four months pregnant was sent to give her blood sample for conducting pre-natal diagnostic test on August 10 at the Sector 63 lab. The in-charge of this laboratory asked her to get ‘maternal blood for foetal DNA (NIPT)’ pre-natal diagnostic test, took her blood sample and charged ₹15,000,” she said.Dr Umang said that on August 13, the victim received the test report on WhatsApp. “During enquiry, the team came to know that this sample collection centre has not fulfilled the requirement as per provision of PC-PNDT Act rules. During questioning, the in-charge revealed that after getting the blood sample, the same was sent to Sector 14 lab for further processing and later was sent to Rohini in Delhi,” she said.During the enquiry, the investigating team found that the private lab chain in Delhi also did not maintain records as per the provisions under PC-PNDT Act, and were also in violation of several other conditions laid down by the Act.The health department said such collection labs are running and working as franchises of the private lab chain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pvt-lab-chain-owner-among-five-booked-for-unlawful-tests-at-centres-in-gurugram-and-delhi-101629657859583.html

It is one of the main reasons for the alarming spike in pollution in Delhi-NCR.Despite a ban on stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, farmers continue to defy it as there is a short window between the harvesting of paddy and sowing of wheat.The high cost of manual or mechanical management of straw is a major reason why farmers choose to burn it.State governments are providing 50 to 80 per cent subsidy to farmers and cooperative societies to buy modern farm equipment for in-situ management of paddy straw, installing paddy straw-based power plants and running a massive awareness campaign against stubble burning.But these measures are yet to make any significant impact on the ground.According to a recent study by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), a Delhi-based not-for-profit policy research institution, a relatively longer stubble-burning period and unfavourable meteorological conditions were primarily responsible for Delhi’s worsening air quality in winters last year.The analysis showed the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 levels exceeded 30 per cent for seven days (between October 10 and November 25) in 2020 as against three days in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/air-quality-panel-asks-ncr-states-to-prepare-plan-on-farm-fires-101629657858587.html

Gurugram saw only six new cases on Sunday.According to the district health bulletin on Sunday, the active case count is 78 while the total tally touched 181, 023 with 921 deaths. Currently, the test positivity rate – the proportion of people testing positive for the infection out of the total samples tested – is 0.1%, which is less than 5% fixed by the World Health Organisation as safe.Data collated through the district health bulletin shows that from July 18 to 24, the weekly cases were 52. The weekly cases maintained in the same range in the subsequent weeks -- 50 from July 24-31; and 51 from August 1-7.Subsequently, weekly cases dropped to 36 from August 8-14 and increased marginally to 39 from August 15-21.“Despite the decline in cases, the department conducts 3,750 tests on an average every day. A 24x7 antigen testing kiosk is functional at the civil hospital in Sector 10 and the polyclinic in sector 31 to facilitate testing. Currently, Gurugram is doing maximum tests, while other districts are administering only 2,000 tests or less than that. With increased testing, we can keep a check on the doubling rate and timely isolation of patients,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.Vaccination in Gurugram is also the highest among all districts. Till now, 2,186,392 doses -- about 1.6 million first doses and over 500,000 second doses -- have been administered in Gurugram.Experts said that people should not stop wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. Senior epidemiologist Dr Rajesh Kumar, the former head of the community medicine department and school of public health, PGIMER-Chandigarh, said, “Vaccination and decline in Covid-19 should not stop people from following preventive norms. Vaccination can only protect from the severity of the disease, hospitalisation and death. It does not prevent the transmission of the virus. Even after being vaccinated, people may contract the virus. It is important to follow Covid-19 protocols like social distancing, avoiding gatherings, ensuring proper ventilation, sanitisation and mask discipline. In a few northern states, cases have increased slightly in some pockets.”According to Kumar, the local administration and police should issue advisory and prevent the gathering of people in market areas, considering that festival season is around the corner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-sees-drop-in-weekly-covid-19-cases-101629657859116.html
23-08-2021||Delhi||Fees hurdle hampers poor students’ higher education dreams||Raju Singh, a student of a Delhi government school, scored 94% in his CBSE Class 12 boards this year, and wants to enrol in mechanical engineering programme to support his family of four. But the 19-year-old is unsure about how to arrange for his fee and is currently preparing for his Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) without any solution in sight.“After my father died around four years ago, my mother has been working as a domestic help to run our family. Two of my siblings are still in school and we have no assets that can be sold. Though I am preparing for JEE, I have no idea how I will arrange the admission fee. I don’t know who to approach for help,” said the Naharpur resident, who graduated from a Delhi government school in Rohini this year.While the graduation percentage in Delhi government schools improved two percentage points from last year to 99.96% and the number of students scoring over 95% jumped from 442 to 885, many of these students are now expressing concerns over their higher education prospects especially in the face of the financial distress caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.Sunita Bhati, a Class 12 teacher at a government school in New Kondli, said institution’s faculty members have been helping students by providing study material and books. However, the pandemic had aggravated the financial problems for several of these families.“Many students ask us for financial assistance and later for their college education as well. These students are very shy, so they refuse to take money directly from us. An institutional mechanism to address these concerns will help,” she said.In June 2019, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who holds the education portfolio, issued an order asking government schools to help over 1,000 meritorious students who scored above 90% in their class 12 examinations to “track their applications to colleges and sort out any issue in their admission.” Schools were also asked to submit a status report by July 31 that year with details of the course pursued by these students and track their progress for “at least during the first year of college.”While schools followed these directives, most treat it as a one-time order and now help students only on an informal basis—meaning several students may be left out of the net. Currently, there is no formal mechanism in place to help all students and record data on their higher education applications.Principals of at least five government schools HT spoke to said they try to arrange for help for underprivileged students. Awadhesh Kumar Jha, principal of a government school in Rohini, said, “We maintained the data for that year and sent it to the education department. But after that, we have been in touch with students at our own level, helping them out in whichever way we can. We have also maintained a strong connection with our alumni so that they too could help in guiding our students.”Lack of an institutionalised mechanism means not all students know who to approach for help. Another government school student Sanjay, who has applied for an undergraduate course at Delhi University with 94.25% aggregate, said, “My father works as a utensil vendor and hasn’t had much work in the past two years due to the pandemic. Even if I get through a good college, it might propel us towards another cycle of debt as he would have to take a loan for my fee. I don’t know who to approach for help. Though there are scholarships, I don’t know if I would be eligible for them or not.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fees-hurdle-hampers-poor-students-higher-education-dreams-101629657798535.html
23-08-2021||Other||Delhi: Restaurant owners feel time relaxation will help businesses||New Delhi: With a Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) order lifting timing restrictions on the operations of restaurants, malls, and other establishments, thousands associated with the sector said they hope business will now return to normal and help recover losses that have piled over the past year-and-a-half.Starting from Tuesday, restaurants and bars in the city will no longer need to wrap up operations by 10pm, a deadline that adversely restricted activity and operations during a crucial window of the day. The state government imposed a complete lockdown in the Capital from April 19 amid an intense rise in Covid-19 cases. As infections started declining, the government began implementing a phased relaxation process from May 31. Markets were allowed to open everyday from June 14 but with restricted working hours till 8pm. Meanwhile, restaurants were allowed to operate till 10pm.Restaurateurs said that restrictions on business in the evening reduced dinner sales and were hampering recovery. “We welcome and applaud the relaxation of rules by the Delhi government in terms of operational hours. It is an extremely encouraging move for the F&B [food and beverage] industry, which will help us to recover and revive our business slowly but surely. A lot of our dinner guests, at both SOCIAL and Smoke House Deli, have been wanting to stay past 10pm and extend their night, and being operational for longer will allow us to do just that. It also gives us room to cater to our guests comfortably without overcrowding at any point in time,” said Satyajit Dhingra, chief regional officer (north), Impresario Handmade Restaurants. Ahead of the festive season, a return to normal business timings is expected to benefit restaurants seeking to recoup losses. “With the festive season around the corner as well as the Covid-19 numbers reducing in the city, people are more comfortable with dining out. That said, our strict safety and hygiene protocols remain in play, with 50% capacity and adequate social distancing at all our restaurants. This helps us ensure a safe dining experience for all,” Dhingra added. Saurabh Suman, manager of Pebble Street in New Friends Colony (NFC), said restricted business timings discouraged guests from visiting the outlet for dinner, a crucial driver of daily sales. “Guests were not comfortable due to the early wrap-up deadline. People usually arrive for dinner by 7.30-8.30pm. By then, we already need to start preparing for the closure. Due to these limitations, people stopped planning dinner outings. Our relationship with our guests was getting affected since visitors were not getting sufficient time to enjoy. Hopefully, now, our guests will be able to enjoy as before,” said Suman. He added that extended working hours will aid in the recovery of business as well. Welcoming the move, SN Kaushal, senior manager of Kwality restaurant at Connaught Place, said that the extension of timings will benefit guests who were earlier being compelled to wrap up early due to the cap on working hours. “It doesn’t look good when someone is out for dinner and we have to constantly remind them to wrap up early. Some guests would also complain about the same. Now, we will be able to serve our guests as before,” said Kaushal. He added that a significant jump in footfall is likely starting from Tuesday. “In comparison to the previous lockdown, recovery has been better this time. With the restrictions on timings getting lifted, we are optimistic that more people will return to our outlet,” said Kaushal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-restaurant-owners-feel-time-relaxation-will-help-businesses-101629657738549.html
23-08-2021||Delhi||Couple kills 2-year-old boy out of hatred, arrested||A couple arrested for kidnapping and murdering a two-year-old boy in west Delhi’s Rajouri Garden area were planning the crime for over an year, the police said on Sunday after arresting them. They said the couple was allegedly jealous of the boy since the family members loved him more than their six-year-old daughter.Investigators said Yamuna and Rajesh kidnapped the boy on Friday when he was playing on a footpath, assaulted him and then drowned him in a drain in Punjabi Bagh. The accused and the victim’s families are unemployed and sleep on the footpath near a flyover in the area.The boy’s body was found in the drain in Saturday.Incidentally, nobody reported the matter to the police. Urvija Goel, DCP (West) said that no PCR call was made in this case, and the incident came to light when a police patrol team spotted a woman crying on the footpath. When they asked her grievance, she told them that her son has gone missing, the DCP said.Goel said footage from more than a dozen CCTV cameras from around the spot from where the family lived was scanned. The footage showed a couple taking the boy towards Punjabi Bagh.An investigator said the couple was identified from the footage, and they were arrested from a slum cluster in Raghubir Nagar. He said the couple has confessed to their crime.After coming to know that the accused have drowned the boy in the drain, rescue operations were immediately launched to find him. Since it rained heavily on Saturday, the drain was flooded. A second investigator said that more than 100 people that included flood department workers, police officials and local residents looked for the body of the boy. It was fished out after hours of search.The second investigator said during further probe to make a watertight case against the accused couple, the police questioned more than 30 ragpickers who are active around that particular stretch of the footpath. One of them, who identified herself by her first name, Ismi, recognised the couple from their photograph. She told the police that she saw them picking up the boy from the footpath on Friday.Ismi’s statement has been recorded before a magistrate, the investigator said.A senior official said that a day after their arrest, more than 30 rag pickers were questioned, and one eye-witness of the incident was identified. A woman named Ismi gave her statement in the court today and identified the couple as the ones she had seen picking up the boy while he was asleep and running away.Quoting what Yamuna told the police during interrogation, the first investigator said that ever since the boy was born, he was given the maximum attention by his grandmother, Geeta. Yamuna felt that Geeta had started ignoring her daughter ever since the boy’s birth.Yamuna wanted to eliminate the child and kept planning. However, her first husband’s death delayed her plans. She got married to Rajesh two years ago, and the two were looking for an opportunity to get rid of the child, the police said.Police said that the couple’s daughter has been left with Rajesh’s family as of now.A case under sections 363 (punishment for kidnapping), 364 (Kidnapping or abducting in order to murder), 302 (punishment for murder), 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and 120 (B) (punishment for criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been registered at the Rajouri Garden police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/couple-kills-2-year-old-boy-out-of-hatred-arrested-101629657739074.html
23-08-2021||Delhi||Kabuli Gurdwara: A sanctuary in Delhi for Afghan violence victims||Guru Arjan Dev ji Gurdwara, located in a narrow lane in the bustling New Mahavir Nagar in the Tilak Nagar area is better known as ‘Kabuli Gurdwara’--- and not without reason. Few people know that it is the nerve- centre of the Afghan Sikh community in Delhi, which built it in the 1990s. In fact, of the estimated 15,000 Afghan Sikhs in Delhi, about 90% live in west Delhi areas such as New Mahavir Nagar, Shiv Nagar, Ashok Nagar, Fateh Nagar, Vikaspuri, and Tilak Nagar. In the streets around gurdwara, one can hear elderly Afghan Sikhs talking to each other in a mix of Pashto and Punjabi language. The gurdwara also has ‘saroops’ ( copies) of Guru Granth Sahib that Sikhs from Afghanistan brought as they fled threats and religious persecution over the past several decades.“ This gurdwara is manged and run by local Afghan community, and we have always helped Sikhs who arrive from Afghanistan, in every possible way. We are also taking care of many Afghanistan Sikh families who were evacuated to India last year,” says Kuldeep Singh, vice-president of the gurdwara’s management committee. In March last year, 25 Sikhs, were killed in an attack on Kabul Gurdwara, after which the Indian government evacuated many Sikh families. Many of them are settled in New Mahavir Nagar in the vicinity of the gurdwara.On Sunday, an Indian Air Force (IAF) C-17 Globemaster aircraft landed at the Hindan airbase in Ghaziabad with 168 travellers, including 107 Indians, from Kabul. About 23 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus were among those evacuated.“We are happy some of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus have been evacuated safely by the government. We are talking to them and will help them in every possible way. We are also in touch with Hindus and Sikhs who are still in Afghanistan. We hope they too will be evacuated soon, ” Kuldeep Singh.Amrik Singh, who was among the passengers and is a native of Ludhiana in Punjab, said, “It took us about five hours to reach Delhi from Kabul, as we have to come through Iran. There were lot of issues there (in Afghanistan). There was firing all around, ” he said.Afghanistan MP Narender Singh Khalsa was also among those airlifted to India from Kabul on Sunday. He broke down as the plane touched down at Hindan airbase.“I feel like crying...Everything that was built in the last 20 years is finished. It’s zero now,” ANI quoted the MP as saying after landing in Ghaziabad.The Taliban marched into Kabul on August 15 after the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government. Most of the top leaders of the group, including Abdul Ghani Baradar, have returned to Afghanistan and are engaged in consultations of forming a government.India evacuated its envoy, diplomats, officials, security personnel and some nationals on two C-17 heavy lift aircraft last week. The government is focused on the safe repatriation of Indians still stuck in the country.Talking about the difficulties that the Afghans who came to India last year are currently facing, Mirwan Singh, 29, said: “My uncle was killed in the Kabul gurdwara attack last year, and we had no choice but to leave Afghanistan. I worked with the Afghan government in Kabul, but life has been pretty tough here in the last one year.” Mirwan Singh works in the Kabuli Gurdwara as a computer operator, taking care of the paperwork relating to visas, citizenship applications and other such. “I am lucky to have got some kind of work here, but most other Afghan youngsters who came last year with us either have no work or working as helpers in shops.”Kuldeep says that the gurdwara pays house rent and provides for all the Sikhs who lost their family members in attacks in 2018 and 2020 in Jalalabad and Kabul respectively, and came to Delhi.“We had offered to help them with ration and rent for a year, but they are in a financially difficult situation and still need our help,” he says. “ A large number of Afghan Sikhs who have arrived since the 1990s have not got citizenship, which makes life difficult for them. And this is one of the reasons why most Sikhs who are currently in Afghanistan wants to be evacuated to Canada and the US rather than India.”A room adjacent to the gurdwara is packed with large sacks of flour, rice, and pulses. “We distribute the ration between first to fifth day each month to about 600 Afghanistan Sikh families. Most of the money comes from members of Delhi’s Afghan Sikh community and donations at gurdwara,” says Harman Singh, 75, who coordinates relief efforts. He came to India from Afghanistan in 1991 and is now an Indian citizen.The gurdwara also runs a school in an adjacent building, which was attended by 280 children before the pandemic -- about 90 of them belonging to Afghan Muslim families and the rest, Sikhs.In the early 1990s, says Kuldeep, there were about 100,000 Hindus and Sikhs in Afghanistan. Most of them were well off and lived in Jalalabad, Ghazni, and Kabul, he said. “They were the biggest exporters and importers in Afghanistan, but facing threats from Mujahideen (or Taliban), they fled to countries such as Canada, the US and India. I still have my shop there in Kabul,” says Kuldeep, who had a wholesale grocery and cosmetics business in the Afghan capital. He came to India in 1991 and has not returned since.“ But most Sikhs who are now left in Afghanistan run small businesses such as grocery store and general stores,” he said.While many Sikhs and Hindus left Afghanistan during the Soviet-Afghan war between 1979 to 1989, the mass exodus of Sikhs and Hindus from the war-torn country started in the early 1990s as Mujahideen took control of most of the country and President Mohammad Najibullah was ousted. Under the Mujahideen, there were constant threats, harassment, extortion, and, religious persecution, targeting Sikhs and Hindus.Harpreet Singh, who looks after the maintenance of all the facilities run by Kabuli Gurdwara, says most of those who arrived in Delhi in the 1990s live in Tilak Nagar area, and many of them have their business in Tank Road in Karol Bagh. The gurdwara complex also has a hospital and a reception hall for organising weddings and other functions.“Those members of our community who cannot afford a banquet hall or a hotel organise weddings here. Most Afghan Sikhs marry within the community because of the reasons of language and culture. But now many youngsters are getting married outside the community too,” said Harpreet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kabuli-gurdwara-a-sanctuary-in-delhi-for-afghan-violence-victims-101629657678576.html
23-08-2021||Delhi||With new world-class sports facilities, Najafgarh capital’s major sports hub||The evening sun is shining bright on the face of Kunal Kharab as he begins the run-up to throw the javelin. He runs a short distance, holding the spear slightly above his head and sends it soaring into the air. It lands about 60 metres away. There are about 50 other youngsters practising the game in the newly built javelin arena of the Mundhela Kalan complex in Najafgarh. Besides, there are over a hundred others playing football on the new synthetic turf, and practising long jump and running around a 400-metre new synthetic track.“Najafgarh is no longer just about wrestlers or cricketers, it is the city’s biggest sports hub with the best sporting facilities in the city, where children are playing every possible sport, ” says Vikas Lakra, an athletics coach at the complex.“Since Neeraj Chopra’s stunning Olympic gold victory, the number of people wanting to learn javelin throw has doubled here,” he adds.Today, one can see hundreds of youngsters and children as young as six year old practising sports such as boxing, volleyball, badminton, football, hockey, shooting, wrestling at several private and government sports facilities, which have come up in the past few years in Najafgarh. In fact, today, the area boasts over 50 indoor and outdoor sports academies, which have been set up in the past few years.The Delhi government has also made a big sporting infrastructure push in the area, investing about ₹150 crore in developing multi-sports complexes. Apart from Mundhela Kalan complex, which has a football ground with synthetic turf and athletic tracks, the government is also developing an 18-acre sports residential complex in Kair village at a cost of ₹140 crore.A FIFA approved football field , and a cricket ground is ready at Kair, and work is in progress to develop tennis and basketball courts, swimming pool and residential quarters for players. Besides, the government has set up wrestling and kabaddi mats in Vyayamshalas ( gymnasiums) in many villages such as Dichaon Kalan, Mitraon, Dhansa, Issapur, Mundhela Khurd.“ We are creating world- class sports facilities in Najagfarh, where sports has been a way of life. Earlier, because of the lack of good sporting facilities, children from the area used to travel to different parts of Delhi, now sportspersons from other parts of the city and even neighbouring states come to Najafgarh, ” says Kailash Gahlot, the local MLA and Delhi’s transport’s minister. “These new sports complexes, where sportspersons will get specialised training will go a long way in encouraging local talent and enable them to compete at the international level, ” adds Gahlot, himself a former football player.Najafgarh and the surrounding villages have been a hub of traditional Indian sports such as kabaddi, wrestling and Kho- Kho. It has produced famous wrestlers, including Sushil Kumar, and kabaddi and Kho- Kho players.Villages such as Rawta, Malakpur Zer, and Kair have been known for their kabaddi teams; Baprola, the village of Olympic medal winner Sushil Kumar, was famous for its wrestlers. Mitraon village had a Kho-Kho team that has won several zonal Kho Kho tournaments in Delhi.Almost all the villages in Najafgarh have their akharas, where the young wrestlers honed their skills. From their village akharas, they often graduated to Bhagwat Swaroop Akhara, the most famous akhara in Najafgarh, and from there to Chhatrasal Stadium in Delhi, where India’s three Olympic medallists Sushil Kumar, Yogeshwar Dutt and Ravi Dahiya got trained.“Youngsters here played traditional rural sports with a view to joining the armed forces. But now the new generation is adopting many other sports such boxing, badminton and those who can afford are getting into cricket,” says Anil Solanki , a sports coach who lives in Baprola village. “Cricket is an expensive game and it gained ground in Najafgarh only after Virender Sehwag played for India.”Indeed, until Sehwag, who earned the nickname of the Nawab of Najafgarh, played for India, cricket was a fringe game in Najafgarh, with no training facilities. In 1990, a cricket coach named Sashi who ran Surmount Club started a summer cricket coaching academy in Najafgarh. Sehwag joined the academy and played for the club. He later trained under AN Sharma at his Vikaspuri cricket coaching centre.His rise to fame in the early 2000s inspired many local youngsters to play cricket and Najafgarh has since produced many players such as Pradeep Sangwan, Kapil Yadav, Nitin Yadav, who has played IPL and represented Delhi in first-class cricket. Today, it has many cricket academies many of which came up in the past decade in what were not so long ago agricultural fields.Nepal Singh, who says he played cricket with Sehwag in Najafgarh during his formative years, today runs a badminton academy that has four indoor courts with green maple wood and synthetic victor flooring. He is currently busy adding another court inside his academy. “More and more youngsters here are getting into individual sports in their quest for a deeper sense of personal achievement and glory. The demand for these sports academies in Najafgarh is rising fast because all parents here want their children to be in sports. Most academies are run by local sportspersons,” he says.It is a late afternoon and about a dozen young boys and girls are practising in his indoor academy. One of them is Akshit, who spends six hours at the academy in the morning and evening. Ask him why he has chosen badminton and he says, “I hope to play at the international level one day. Besides, this game is affordable and I think it will help sharpen my body and mind. Unlike in the past, there are good badminton training facilities here in Najafgarh,” he says. Nepal Singh says many of his wards have played at the state level and in Delhi Badminton League (DBL).Today, Najafgarh has several private badminton and tennis courts. But if one goes by the number of sports academies, boxing seems to be one of the most popular sports in the area. Over a dozen boxing academies have cropped up in the past five years where one can spot hundreds of children and teenagers — both girls and boys and some as young as five — practising their punches.Boxing coaches say this fast-growing interest in the combat sport has been inspired by the growing number of Indian boxers making it big in international events, the increasing number of boxing tournaments and championships in India, and the glamour associated with boxing. “Young people in this predominately rural area are intelligent and well-built, and boxing is an aspirational sport for them,” says Brij Mohan, who started MB boxing Academy three years back.“Nowhere in the city is the craze for boxing as intense as in Najafgarh. In fact, I have many students who have given up kabaddi and wrestling for boxing. Many of our students are children of former and current wrestlers, and kabaddi players,” says Mohan. About a dozen of his 50 students are girls, including Vishi Balyan, 16, who gave up kabaddi for boxing. “Women are as good at boxing as men. My sole objective is to win an Olympic medal. If Lovlina Borgohain can do it, so can I, ” says Balyan as she awaits her turn for a practice bout in the ring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/with-new-world-class-sports-facilities-najafgarh-capital-s-major-sports-hub-101629657558577.html

Police said that all the fake notes were in denominations of ₹100 and ₹200.During questioning, Zakir told the police that he received the fake notes from an associate in south-east Delhi’s Jamia Nagar and communicated with him on WhatsApp.“The accused said they decided to circulate the fake notes in small denominations of ₹100 or 200, as no one would pay much heed to these small amounts and they can be easily circulated in the market,” a police officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fake-currency-racket-busted-in-delhi-cops-recover-cash-worth-over-4-lakh-101629657559051.html
23-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi Metro replaces existing conventional lights with LED units||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Sunday said it has started replacing conventional lighting in its stations such as incandescent bulbs and florescent lamps with LED lights to save energy.In a statement issued on Sunday, the DMRC said LED lights will be installed at 155 locations, including Metro stations, depots, parking, and other facilities that were constructed under the networks first (2005) and second (2010) phases.“The DMRC has already installed one lakh (100,000) LED lights at 155 locations, and by the end of October this year, it will install 35,000 additional LED lights in other locations,” the Metro statement said.The Metro body added that it has “covered 75% of the drive”, and will complete replacing the remaining lights by the end of October this year.The Delhi Metro said the LED-based light system will help DMRC save around half of the energy expenditure as against the existing system.The network also said that it will recover the cost of the new lights in around two years.The lifespan of an LED system is longer compared to conventional existing lights, with much reduced maintenance cost. On an average, an LED system lasts 50,000 operating hours or more, it said.An LED source is more than 40 times higher in lifespan than an incandescent bulb. In addition, LED lights have energy efficiency component which makes them consume very low amount of power, officials said.Undertaking this drive at already operational stations was a challenging task for the DMRC maintenance teams, it said.“Even during night, the work could be carried out for around two hours only in a day since the time window available from the close of last passenger service and commencement of first passenger service is very limited, and other important operational preparedness and routine maintenance activities are undertaken in this period only,” the DMRC said.The DMRC had to arrange special scaffoldings and cranes to cover the spaces at twice or thrice the normal height of a building which is again very tricky and a time-consuming exercise, it said. The DMRC has already implemented LED-based lighting solutions at its Phase-III stations and similar system will be adopted for upcoming Phase-IV stations also, officials said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-metro-replaces-existing-conventional-lights-with-led-units-101629657498527.html

Guru Nanak died in Kartarpur on September 22, 1539.Pilgrimage to the Kartarpur Sahib gurdwara was suspended in March 2020 because of the Covid-19 outbreak.The decision to open the Kartarpur shrine was taken by the national command and operation centre (NCOC) on Saturday. Dawn newspaper reported that the NCOC meeting unanimously decided to allow Sikh pilgrims to visit Kartarpur next month under strict Covid-19 protocols.Due to the Delta variant, India was in category C in Pakistan from May 22 till August 12, and a special approval was required for people coming from the country, including Sikh pilgrims.However, fully-vaccinated persons with certificates will be allowed to enter Pakistan provided they show Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test reports, which should not be more than 72 hours old.Apart from this, a Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) will also be conducted at airports and in case of a positive result, the individual will not be allowed to enter Pakistan.According to Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs), a maximum of 300 people will be permitted to assemble at a time at the gurdwara.The ministry of national health services (NHS), Pakistan, had introduced three categories to deal with the coronavirus spread. “Countries in category A are exempted from the mandatory Covid-19 test, travellers from areas falling in category B are required to present a negative PCR test that must be taken within 72 hours of the travel date, while visitors from nations in category C are restricted and can travel only under specific NCOC guidelines,” the official said.India signed the Kartarpur corridor agreement with Pakistan on October 24, 2019. Under the pact, Indian pilgrims of all faiths are allowed to undertake round-the-year visa-free travel through the Kartarpur Corridor to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, one of the most revered shrines of Sikhs in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guru-nanak-death-anniv-pak-allows-fully-vaccinated-pilgrims-to-visit-kartarpur-101629657259113.html

23-08-2021||Pune||Ahead of Maha local body elections all cases against organisers of, participants in bullock cart races withdrawn||With local body elections in Maharashtra drawing closer, the state government has decided to go soft on bullock cart racing. The government has now decided to withdraw all cases against those who participated in bullock cart races, including during lockdowns. A meeting has been organised on Tuesday to explore legal ways to resume the races in Maharashtra. The announcement with regard to withdrawing of cases was made by Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse Patil on Saturday. Walse Patil, while speaking in Ambegaon, said, “We are on the same side here and want to restart races. However there is ban by the Supreme Court, which will not be taking cognisance of your protest. At the same time, the government has decided withdraw all cases across the state against bullock cart owners,” said Walse Patil.Earlier last week, BJP MLC Gopichand Padalkar and some 50 others were booked for allegedly organising a bullock cart race in Atpadi tehsil of Sangli, defying a ban on the activity. The race took place in the early hours of Friday near Jhare village, a little away from the venue that was advertised among local residents and where a huge police posse was deployed, an official said. Padalkar said police had told them that the race could create a law and order problem and organisers cooperated. ‘However, we came to know that some other farmers organised a bullock race somewhere else. The state government must respect the sentiments of people and allow such races. It should approach the Supreme Court for resumption of bullock cart races,’ he said. An Atpadi police station official said Padalkar and 41 supporters and some 8-10 unidentified people have been booked under IPC, Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and Disaster Management Act provisions. Sangli’s superintendent of police Dikshit Gedam said bullock cart races are banned in the state and action would be taken against those violating it. Maharashtra minister Jayant Patil said a meeting has been organised by the animal husbandry minister to explore if the bullock cart races can resume in Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/all-cases-against-organisers-of-participants-in-bullock-cart-races-withdrawn-101629652098100.html
23-08-2021||Mumbai||Unnerving, crushing fatigue tops post-Covid complaints, say doctors||Bhandup resident Prabhavati Nilve wakes up at 6.30am, but it takes another two hours for her to gather the energy to get out of bed. “The weakness irritates me,” said the 50-year-old who had tested positive for Covid-19 in January, but still struggles from the lingering aftereffects of the viral infection. Nilve, like hundreds of Covid-19 patients battling the long-term impact of the virus, find themselves at the post-Covid outpatient departments (OPDs) often with one question: Why is my body not feeling all right?The second wave in Mumbai may have settled but post-Covid OPDs continue to be busy with patients. The Hindustan Times met Nilve on Thursday at the Fortis Hospital’s post-Covid-OPD in Mulund, the first such clinic that opened in the city last August. A typical day at the OPD sees patients from across the city, many who were admitted for Covid treatment at Fortis, and some like Nilve who were treated at other hospitals but require post-Covid rehabilitation.An IT manager in a pharmaceutical firm, Nilve was admitted to Surana Hospital in Chembur for five days after she tested positive for Covid. Doctors told her that the infection had spread to her lungs and she was put on a cocktail of drugs including steroids, antibiotics and Remdesivir. After discharge, she felt better, but her sugar levels and blood pressure had shot up, for which she had to be put on medication. In May, her palpitations, weakness and shortness of breathing increased so much that she had to be admitted to a local nursing home for four days where she was put on nutritional supplements.“My family doctor told me that the symptoms I was experiencing were all a part of the post-Covid effect,” said Nilve who was among the six patients who visited the OPD on Thursday. This was her second visit to the OPD. “I have become irritable. At times, it’s hard for me to have a conversation with people,” Nilve said, adding that she is also troubled by immense hair fall.According to infectious disease consultant Dr Kirti Sabnis who examined Nilve, nearly 30% of patients complain of severe, debilitating fatigue, unable to resume their daily activities like bathing, cooking, walking or working from home. In some cases, the symptoms persist for two to six months. “It plays on their mind, often making them anxious,” said Sabnis, as she screened the files of a husband-wife duo who had contracted Covid-19 in July. The couple from Vikhroli was on their second post-Covid consultation. The husband had recovered, but the wife who was put on steroids during Covid-19 treatment showed a tendency of high blood sugar. “Blood sugar levels fluctuate generally after patients are put on steroids. You have to exercise and maintain a low carbohydrate diet,” Sabnis told the woman, prescribing them a two-dose pneumococcal vaccine and a single dose influenza vaccine as a precaution against other viral diseases. “After Covid, patients generally have low immunity which makes them susceptible to other viral infections. We, therefore, recommend them to take the flu and pneumonia shots,” she said.Another patient, Sunil Kumar Bandhu, 58, who came from Kharghar, was recovering from a bout of viral infection. He had contracted Covid-19 in August last year and was on his fourth follow up at the OPD. An avid walker, Bandhu had recovered well considering that he had spent 24 days in the hospital on oxygen support battling Covid, 10 of them in the intensive care unit (ICU). “We have observed that people who have been actively exercising recover better. The lung patches also resolve,” said Sabnis, who advised Bandhu to undergo a pulmonary function test (PFT)- a test to determine how well the lungs are functioning.Patients undergo a battery of blood tests during their first visit to the OPD. Those with persistent complaints undergo a chest X-ray, PFT, and high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan of the chest for a better understanding of the impact on their lungs. Typically, post-Covid clinics help patients to build endurance with nutritional supplements and diet planning in addition to breathing exercises for improved lung function. Some patients need bronchodilators, while some have to be eased into simple activities like taking stairs. Doctors said that at least one in 10 patients require counselling, however, most refuse to get a consultation. “Put simply, post-Covid care is like preparing a person for a marathon,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, a critical care specialist at Fortis Hospital and a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force.Just five months into the pandemic, the Fortis Hospital had started receiving patients with severe myalgia, chronic fatigue, unknown fear, disturbed bowels habits, insomnia and some cases of thrombosis after Covid. “By then, we had realised that there were post-Covid impacts. The medical fraternity across the country had started sharing observations on internal groups, social media, and other platforms,” recalled Sabnis.The KEM Hospital in Parel, Apollo Hospital in Navi Mumbai and some jumbo centres also opened post-Covid care setups due to the increased demand. In the first wave, the Fortis OPD received eight to 10 patients every day. During the second wave, their daily footfall hovered between 10 to 12 patients. The numbers highlight the need for more robust post-Covid setups as we anticipate the third wave amidst widespread Delta variants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/unnerving-crushing-fatigue-tops-post-covid-complaints-says-doctors-101629652039352.html
23-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai sees single Covid death on Sunday||Only one Covid-19 death was reported in the city on Sunday, for the first time since the outbreak of pandemic in city. The toll in the city now stands at 15,947, with a case fatality rate of 2.1%.Mumbai recorded 294 new Covid cases on Sunday, taking the tally to 741,164. Mumbai now has 3,280 active Covid-19 cases. The single death reported in Mumbai on Sunday was a female Covid-19 patient, in the age group of 40 to 60 years. According to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), she had no comorbidity. The drop in the number of cases and deaths could also be because of the lag in reporting on weekends, according to the officials. During the second wave, the number of deaths reported in a day in Mumbai began to drop to a single digit from the first week of June. Total deaths reported in Mumbai now contributes to 11.7% of total deaths reported in the state, with Maharashtra recording 135,962 cumulative Covid deaths. Alongside the improvement in case fatality rate, the positivity rate in the city has also gone down. On Sunday, Mumbai showed a positivity rate of 0.9%, as BMC conducted 32,616 Covid-19 tests on Saturday. Positivity rate is calculated as a per cent of positive cases reported for the total number of tests done during a particular time frame. Mumbai’s recovery rate has shot up to 97%, and the overall growth rate of cases is 0.04%. The doubling rate for Mumbai has gone up to 2,030 days. The doubling rate is calculated as the number of days taken for the present number of cases to double. Meanwhile, the vaccination drive will continue in Mumbai on Monday between 9am and 5pm. Last week, the drive was suspended on Thursday and Friday, due to a shortage of doses. On Thursday night, BMC received 160,240 vaccine doses. Mangala Gomare, executive health officer said, “Mumbai has sufficient doses to operate all vaccine centres on Monday.” So far, 2,161,939 citizens have completed both doses of the vaccine, and 6,340,138 beneficiaries have received their first shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-single-covid-death-on-sunday-101629651678696.html
23-08-2021||Pune||Army Sports Institute, Pune, at the forefront of India’s sports development||Thirty-four Olympians, 22 Commonwealth Games’ medallists, and 21 Asian Games’ medallists, apart from six medallists at international youth meets – this is what the Army Sports Institute (ASI) has given to Indian sports over the last 21 years.Tokyo Olympian Neeraj Chopra, gold medallist in the javelin throw, trained at ASI during the initial years of his career.Since its inception in July 1, 2001, ASI has been the first choice for Indian athletes to train at, ahead of any multi-national sport event.Ahead of the Tokyo Olympics, India’s boxing contingent trained at the centre, while archers Deepika Kumari and Atanu Das also trained at the ASI.The Indian Boxing Federation of India shifted the national camp to Pune from Delhi after a surge of Covid-19 cases in the national capital in May.At that time, BFI secretary Hemanta Kalita had said, “Considering the safety of boxers, coaches and support staff, we have created a training plan in separate clusters to minimise the risk. These are tough times, we have to be careful, but we also have a job at hand.”Pune was also hit badly by the second Covid wave, but ASI held the camp successfully,” said an ASI coach, requesting anonymity.“We were all ready with our preparation to keep Covid away from ASI and none of the Olympic-bound athletes faced any problem during their training.ASI provides world class facilities for Archery, Athletics, Boxing, Diving, Wrestling, Weightlifting and Fencing. For each discipline we have a batch of separate coaches.The sports science faculty is a key attraction for athletes started when began its ‘Mission Olympics’ programme. The faculty is helping to generate scientific data about athletes’ performances which has made a big difference,” added the coach.The world class facility is helping athletes to produce results on the international stage.Avinash Sable, steeplechase runner who qualified for the Tokyo Olympics, said, “ASI is one of best facilities in the country. It is due to the Army I was able to identify my talent. Easy access to grounds and other training facilities makes it more comfortable to stay at ASI.”Sable did not qualify for the final, although he set a new national record with a timing of 8:18:12 improving his personal best from 8:20:20.“Before coming up with these facilities, the Army researched what other countries are providing to their athletes and then planned a complete structure. That is why it produces results for the country,” added the coach.31 Olympians from defence services who trained at ASIArcherySubedar Tarundeep Rai, VSM - Recurve 2004Subedar Majhi Sawaiyan, VSM - Recurve 2004Subedar Tarundeep Rai, VSM - Recurve 2012Subedar Tarundeep Rai, VSM - Recurve 2020Havaldar Pravin Jadhav - Recurve 2020AthleticsSubedar Surender Singh - 10000M 2008Subedar Irfan KT – 20km walk - 2012Subedar Basant Bahadur Rana – 50km walk 2012Subedar Ram Singh Yadav - Marathon 2012Subedar Sandeep Kumar – 50km walk 2016Subedar Ganpathy K – 50km walk 2016Subedar Gopi T - Marathon 2016Subedar Nitender Singh Rawat - Marathon 2016Subedar Kheta Ram - Marathon 2016Subedar Jinson Johnson - 800M 2016Subedar Arokia Rajiv - 4 x 400 relay 2016Subedar Kunhu Md 4 x 400 relay 2016Subedar Neeraj Chopra Javelin - 2020 (gold medal)Subedar Avinash Sable 3000M S/C 2020Subedar Irfan KT – 20km walk 2020Subedar Sandeep Kumar – 20km walk 2020GDR Rahul 20km walk - 2020Havaldar Gurpreet Singh 50km walk 2020Subedar Arokia Rajiv 4 x 400M mixed relay 2020BoxingSubedar L Debendro Singh, VSM – 49kg 2012 (Bronze) Subedar Amit, VSM 52kg 2020Subedar Manish Kaushik 63kg 2020Subedar Maj Satish Kumar +91kg 2020WeightliftingSubedar Ravi Kumar, VSM 69kg 2012WrestlingSubedar Ravinder Khatri 85kg (GR) 2016Subedar Deepak Punia 86kg (FS) 2020||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/army-sports-institute-pune-at-the-forefront-of-india-s-sports-development-101629651318180.html

23-08-2021||Pune||Pune district: 0.3% of those aged below 20 years have succumbed to Covid-19||Despite anticipation about a third Covid-19 wave affecting children, data shows that 0.3% of those aged below 20 years have succumbed to the Covid-19 infection. Since a Covid-19 vaccine for children is yet to be allowed in the country, those aged below 18 years are thought to be a vulnerable population. The current data shows that of the over 18,575 deaths reported due to Covid-19, 57 deaths are of those below the age of 20 in Pune district.As of August 21, of the 57 deaths of those aged below 20 years, 20 are in the 0-10-year group and 37 are in the 11-20- year age group, which accounts for 0.3% of those who succumbed to Covid-19 in the district.Out of the 57, the maximum deaths were reported from Pune city which is 37. Sixteen are from Pune rural, including villages, nagar parishads and cantonments, and four from PCMC. The mortality rate among children has been constant due to Covid-19. The state had also reported 266 deaths due to the infection in the age group of 0-20 years, of the over 47,000 deaths reported as of December 2020. This puts the mortality rate of this age group at 0.5% in the state.Experts believe that although children could remain symptomatic during the course of a Covid-19 infection, they are highly susceptible to post Covid-19 infections and could also behave as spreaders in the first two weeks of the infection. Dr Sagar Lad, a paediatrician who works as a consultant at multiple city hospitals said, “It is true that children do not show severe symptoms or deaths due to Covid-19. However, the worrying trend is that most children who remain asymptomatic or with mild symptoms during the acute Covid-19 period, could act as a spreader of the infection to others in the family for the first two weeks, and then the post Covid-19 complications begin. The multi-inflammatory syndrome in children, also known as MIS-C, leads to more complications are we are getting a few cases even now. MIS-C primarily includes high grade fever about 102-103 in some cases, diarrhoea, red eyes, rashes on the body and other viral flu like presentation. The reason for this is the high number of IgG antibodies in children which leads to a cytokine storm and thus inflammation and damage to vessels and tissues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-district-0-3-of-those-aged-below-20-years-have-succumbed-to-covid19-101629649337927.html
23-08-2021||Mumbai||Contempt of court power must be used to protect rights: Bombay HC||The power of contempt of court is to be used not to ‘protect the dignity of the court’ but “to protect and vindicate the right of the people so that the administration of justice is not perverted, prejudiced, obstructed, or interfered with” a bench of the Bombay High Court at Goa led by Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court Dipankar Datta has said.Disposing of a contempt petition filed by Kashinath Shetye, a public spirited person, who had hauled one David Cleaver, a British citizen before the court alleging that he was uploading videos on YouTube making ‘scurrilous’ allegations against the lower judiciary, the High Court ruled that “such content is best treated with contempt, rather than in contempt.”“In such matters, we remind ourselves that it is the people that have a vital stake in the free and effective administration of justice. The Court has the duty of protecting this interest of the community in the due administration of justice and, so, it is entrusted with the power to punish for its contempt. This power is to be only sparingly exercised, not to protect the dignity of the Court against insult or injury, but, to protect and vindicate the right of the people so that the administration of justice is not perverted, prejudiced, obstructed, or interfered with,” the bench of the Chief Justice and Justice M S Sonak, said.“According to us the shoulders of our institution are broad enough to shrug off such scurrilous allegations. The dignity and authority of our judicial institutions are neither dependent on the opinions allegedly expressed nor can the dignity of our institution and its officers be tarnished by such stray slights or irresponsible content. Such content, allegedly uploaded by respondent no.1 (David Cleaver) is best treated with contempt, rather than in contempt particularly (he) has neither bothered to cite any specific instances nor bothered to lodge any complaints backed by even, prima facie, credible material,” the High Court said.The High Court said that after inquiries, comments were revealed to be ‘irresponsible’ and were possibly used by “some disgruntled litigants.”“Therefore to take this matter any further might only serve to feed the publicity craze of those that have uploaded this content to provoke rather than out of some concern to bring to fore some genuine grievance concerning the administration of justice in Goa,” the High Court said.Shetye, who appeared in person had alleged that Cleaver by making false and scurrilous allegations against some judicial officers of the District Judiciary and uploading this content on Youtube and Whatsapp has committed criminal contempt. He also received consent from the Advocate General before filing the petition.The Court agreed that the content “prima facie’’ is quite contumacious and might, if established, constitute criminal contempt. But said it preferred not to proceed with the matter since it was “better to proceed with confidence in our institutions and our judicial officers who function to the best of their abilities without fear or favor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/power-of-contempt-to-be-used-not-to-protect-dignity-of-court-but-right-of-people-bombay-hc-chief-justice-101629618077732.html

23-08-2021||World||New York City says Covid vaccine mandatory for public school teachers, staff||New York City public school teachers and staff will be required to get vaccinated against COVID-19, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday, as the city pushes to get more residents vaccinated and slow the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant.The city's health department will issue an order mandating that all 148,000 staff members in the United States' largest school district get at least one dose of a vaccine by Sept. 27, de Blasio said. School is set to begin in New York City on Sept. 13.In a first for city employees, Department of Education staff will no longer have the option to submit to weekly testing instead."We want our schools to be extraordinarily safe all year long," de Blasio told a news conference.The mayor's announcement followed news on Monday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had granted full approval to the Pfizer Inc/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine, a move public health officials hope will convince Americans hesitant about the shots that they are safe.Meisha Porter, chancellor of New York City's public schools, said at least 63% of employees are vaccinated against COVID-19.School employees in Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington state have also been ordered to get the vaccine.Earlier this month, New York City required proof of COVID-19 vaccination at restaurants, gyms and other businesses. The mandate sparked backlash from some business owners and residents who have sued de Blasio.The latest mandate also could face resistance from the powerful unions representing New York City teachers and staff.Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers (UTF), said the union's priority was to keep children safe and school open. But in a statement, he added that "there are many implementation details, including provisions for medical exceptions, that by law must be negotiated with the UFT and other unions, and if necessary, resolved by arbitration."Efforts to increase vaccination rates and implement public safety measures like mask wearing in schools have faced staunch opposition in some parts of the country, and especially in some Southern states that have been hard hit by the Delta variant.In Florida, some school districts that have defied a ban on mask mandates in public schools issued by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis are now facing the potential loss of some public funding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-says-covid-vaccine-mandatory-for-public-school-teachers-staff-101629740559734.html

We look forward to the FDA's full approval of these vaccines soon.Monday’s announcement by the United States’ top health agency follows reports from last week which stated that the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine will receive full approval “next week.” The two-dose messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine received Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) from the FDA on December 11 last year, and, since then, more than 204 million Pfizer shots have been administered across the country, according to data complied by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The medical term for a full approval is “biologics license application” (BLA). The Pfizer jab becomes the first in the United States to receive BLA, and will now be manufactured as “Comirnaty.” The award of full approval was described by Janet Woodcock, the FDA’s acting commissioner, as a “milestone in the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic.”According to Johns Hopkins University’s coronavirus tracker, the US has thus far seen more than 37 million cases of Covid-19, along with a related toll of nearly 630,000, both of which are highest globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-welcomes-fda-s-full-approval-for-pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine-101629739891734.html
23-08-2021||World||Kabul airport curbs blocking medical, food supplies to Afghanistan: WHO||More than 500 tonnes of medical supplies including surgical equipment and severe malnutrition kits due to be delivered to Afghanistan this week are stuck because of Kabul airport restrictions, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Monday.Aid agencies say it is critical that medical and food supplies reach some 300,000 people displaced in Afghanistan over the past two months amid advances by Islamist Taliban insurgents that culminated in their capture of Kabul on August 15.Nearly 18.5 million people - half the population - rely on aid and the humanitarian needs are expected to grow due to drought. But the closure of Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport to commercial flights has held up deliveries, WHO regional emergency director Dr Richard Brennan told Reuters."While the eyes of the world now are on the people being evacuated and the planes leaving, we need to get supplies in to help those who are left behind," Brennan said in an emailed statement.Also Read | Afghanistan vulnerable to hunger, illness after Taliban takeover: WHO raises alarmHe said the WHO was calling for empty planes to divert to its warehouse in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), to collect the supplies on their way to pick up evacuees from Afghanistan.The United States (US) has enlisted six commercial airlines to help move Afghan evacuees, however, Washington and NATO coalition partners have so far indicated that they cannot bring supplies on incoming evacuation planes due to "operational constraints and security concerns", Brennan said."The US is using these commercial airlines only for evacuation," he said, adding that the WHO was exploring various options and reaching out to other governments."We have been advised to explore options at other airports such as Kandahar, Jalalabad and Bagram air bases. We do not yet have aircraft to fly even to those bases."The executive director of the UN children's agency UNICEF, Henrietta Fore, said on Monday around 10 million children across Afghanistan need humanitarian assistance and that conditions are expected to deteriorate further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabul-airport-curbs-blocking-medical-food-supplies-to-afghanistan-who-101629738599539.html
23-08-2021||World||Taliban name acting head of Afghan central bank to address ‘people’s problems’||More than a week after the Islamist insurgents Taliban swept Afghanistan’s capital Kabul with no or minimal resistance, the group has appointed one of its officials as the acting governor of the Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) – which is the country’s central bank — spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said on Twitter.Haji Mohammad Idris has been named the acting head of the DAB, even as the war-torn nation struggles with enormous economic turmoil with ATMs running out of cash and prices of essential items skyrocketing, Bloomberg reported.In his Twitter post, Mujahid stated that Idris will “address the looming banking issues and the problems of the people,” according to the translation by Bloomberg.Muhammad Jalal, a member of the Taliban’s cultural commission told Bloomberg over a text message that Idris headed the group’s economic commission in the past.In an interview with Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast, exiled central bank chief Ajmal Ahmady said that Afghanistan under Taliban faces an array of shocks that probably will result in weaker currency, capital controls and rapid inflation. He fled the country following the escape of other officials and leaders of Afghanistan, including former President Ashraf Ghani.Taliban fighters have been making swift movements towards Kabul by capturing provincial capitals – starting with minor ones to major hubs, till August 15. Soon after Kabul fell in their hands, Afghan nationals began to make a beeline at the Hamid Karzai International Airport to leave the country and their regime.Although the militants have, through its amnesty, assured that all Afghans will be safe and secured under their rule and that women and girls will be allowed to go to school as well as work, world leaders and organisations remain doubtful about the same.Idris’ appointment comes at a time when Afghani currency hit a record low last week, soon after the Taliban took over. Banks have reportedly been shut and prices of basic food items such as oil and flour have risen by as high as 35 per cent over the previous seven days. The Bloomberg report added that pharmacies and drugstores are also shut across Kabul, even as Mujahid said that the group’s fighters are patrolling the city to ensure security.Also Read | Taliban step up reprisals after promising amnestyA spokesperson of the Afghanistan finance ministry, Mohammad Rafi Tabe, told Bloomberg over phone that banks in the country will become “operational by tomorrow or the day after.”Tabe added though the finance minister left Afghanistan prior to the recapture of Kabul, the ministry is back to work and that all of its staff will function as per the same positions they had before the Taliban took over.Meanwhile, one of the extremist group’s officials, in an interview with Sky News in Doha, warned the US against delaying the deadline of August 31 for withdrawing its forces from Afghanistan. “If the US or UK were to seek additional time to continue evacuations – the answer is no. Or there would be consequences,” Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen was quoted as saying.Also Read | Afghanistan crisis: Taliban warn US of 'consequences' if August 31 deadline extendedHe further said that the extension is a “red line” and delaying the withdrawal of forces would mean “[America] is extending occupation while there is no need for that.”Shaheen said that if the US is intent on “continuing occupation” of Afghanistan, it will “provoke a reaction” from the Taliban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-name-acting-head-of-afghan-central-bank-to-address-people-s-problems-101629734026607.html
23-08-2021||World||US health agency fully approves Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine||The top US health agency on Monday granted full approval to Pfizer-BioNTech’s two-shot messenger RNA (mRNA) Covid-19 vaccine, making it the first for the United States.It will now retail as Comirnaty (koe-mir’-na-tee).Janet Woodcock, the acting head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), called the approval a “milestone”.“While this and other vaccines have met the FDA’s rigorous, scientific standards for emergency use authorisation (EUA), as the first FDA-approved Covid-19 vaccine, the public can be very confident that this vaccine meets the high standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality the agency requires of an approved product,” she said.The full authorisation will address reservations harboured by people who refused to be vaccinated citing EUA granted to all Covid-19 vaccines available in the United States thus far. It will allow the company to retail the vaccine more freely, through pharmacies and also advertise it.Pfizer-BioNTech s Covid-19 vaccine was the first to be used in the United States (it had been rolled out already in the United Kingdom and Canada), after the FDA granted it EUA on December 11, 2020 for people 16 years of age and older. Its rollout was a national event, reported breathlessly from the first truck that left the company’s plant in Portage, Michigan on December 13, to the administering of the first shot to a healthcare worker at a New York hospital on December 14.Since then, more than 204 million Pfizer shots have been administered, according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The EUA approval for Moderna’s two-shot vaccine, also based on mRNA technology followed shortly and then Johnson & Johnson’s one-shot vaccine. AstraZeneca’s vaccine, which is used in India as Covishield, has still not been authorised for use, not even emergency one.The FDA says it grants emergency use authorisation during public health emergencies to make available medical products that may be “effective in preventing, diagnosing, or treating a disease, provided that the FDA determines that the known and potential benefits of a product, when used to prevent, diagnose, or treat the disease, outweigh the known and potential risks of the product”.For full authorisation for Comirnaty, the FDA said it analysed data from about 20,000 vaccine and 20,000 placebo recipients between the ages of ages 16 and older who did not have evidence of the Covid-19 virus infection within a week of receiving the second dose.Its safety was evaluated in approximately 22,000 people who received the vaccine and 22,000 people who received a placebo 16 years of age and older, the agency said.The vaccine was found to be 91% effective in preventing Covid-19, according to the clinical trial data. More than half the participants of the clinical trial were followed for four months and an estimated 12,000 for six months.The most common side-effects of Comirnaty were pain, redness and swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle or joint pain, chills and fever. “The vaccine is effective in preventing Covid-19 and potentially serious outcomes including hospitalisation and death,” said the FDA.The agency also evaluated the data for myocarditis and pericarditis. It has been “determined that the data demonstrate increased risks, particularly within the seven days following the second dose”, the FDA said. The risk is higher among males under 40 compared to females and older males; and it was the highest in males 12 through 17 years of age.Though the data showed most individuals have had resolution of symptoms, some people had to be administered intensive care support, the agency said further. These risks will be included in the Comirnaty Prescribing Information. “Information is not yet available about potential long-term health outcomes,” the FDA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-health-agency-fully-approves-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-101629732146050.html
23-08-2021||World||FDA grants full approval to Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine||The coronavirus vaccine developed by American pharmaceutical firm Pfizer in partnership with Germany's BioNTech SE has been granted full approval in the United States, the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) said in a statement on Monday. The announcement follows reports from last week that the full approval may be granted soon.Also Read | Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine may get full approval in US next weekJanet Woodcock, the FDA's acting commissioner, described this as a "milestone" in the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic. "While millions have already safely received Covid-19 vaccines, we recognise that for some, an approval from us may now instill additional confidence to get vaccinated," Woodcock said.The full approval of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine candidate means that the jab can now be branded under the brand name of "Comirnaty." It also becomes the first shot to receive such an approval in the United States. Though the vaccine will continue to be available under Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) for children in the 12-15 age group, it may now be prescribed by physicians for children aged below 12 if they think it will be beneficial.FDA granted EUA to the jab on December 11 last year.In medical terms, a full approval is known as "biologics license application" (BLA). FDA approves EUA on the basis of results of an interim trial if it is of the opinion that benefits outweigh the risks. For BLA, on the other hand, data should be submitted only after the completion of clinical trials.The regulator's approval of Pfizer's submission for BLA was on the basis of an updated data from the vaccine's clinical trial, during which its safety and efficacy was evaluated among more than 40,000 participants.With the country witnessing a fresh surge of the coronavirus pandemic due to the Delta variant, authorities last week approved a Covid-19 booster shot, from September 20. According to Johns Hopkins University, the US has thus far seen more than 37 million Covid-19 cases and nearly 630,000 related fatalities, the highest globally on both counts.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-receives-full-approval-from-usfda-101629728250393.html
23-08-2021||World||Covid-19: Researchers identify antibody 'highly protective' against SARS-CoV-2 variants||Researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, claim to have identified an antibody which, they say, is "highly protective" against various variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, when delivered in low doses, news agency PTI has reported. For the study, the group immunised mice with the receptor-binding domain (RBD), a key part of a protein known as "spike." This protein is used by SARS-CoV-2 to attach itself to the respiratory tract of a human body, and to invade cells in it.The team then proceeded to extract antibody-producing cells, and obtained from them 43 antibodies which recognise RBD. These antibodies were then screened on the basis of how well these prevent the original SARS-CoV-2 virus from infecting cells kept in a dish. Separately, nine of the "most potent" antibodies were tested on mice to check if these could protect animals infected with the original SARS-CoV-2 strain. According to the researchers, multiple antibodies passed the test, with varying degrees of potency. Two of these, found to be the most effective at protecting the mice, were selected and tested on a range of variants which cause the viral disease.The variants included all four variants of concern (VoC) -- Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta -- and Kappa and Iota, both of which are variants of interest (VoI). Finally, the team found that one antibody, SARS2-38, "easily neutralised" all the six variants it was tested against, noting, in particular, the inability of the Beta variant to resist the antibody. This, they said, is "particularly remarkable" as the Beta variant is known for its resistance to antibodies. Speaking on the exercise, Michael S Diamond, a professor at the School of Medicine said, "Current antibodies may work against some variants, but not all. Since the virus is likely to continue to evolve, having broadly neutralising, effecting antibodies which work individually, and can also be paired to form new combinations, will likely prevent any resistance from the virus."The findings of the study were posted as a "pre-proof" in the journal Immunity. The results, according to the researchers, could help in the development of new antibody-based therapies likely to not lose potency as SARS-CoV-2 mutates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-researchers-identify-antibody-highly-protective-against-sars-cov-2-variants-101629720378721.html

One Chinese national suffered minor injuries and several local personnel were injured or killed,” Wang said on Monday.“We are shocked and condemn this incident, mourn the Pakistani personnel killed in the attack and convey sympathy to the bereaved families and injured,” he added.“We urge the Pakistan side to arrest the perpetrators and punish them as soon as possible,” Wang said.The Pakistani side has given proper treatment to the injured Chinese personnel, he said, adding that Islamabad said they will take every effort to ensure the safety of the Chinese personnel projects in Pakistan.“China will work with Pakistan to address the terrorist threats and protect the safety of our people and personnel in Pakistan.”“Terrorism,” Wang said, “is the common enemy of mankind. China opposes any force using terrorism to seek geopolitical interests and calls on all regional countries to collaborate in eradicating terrorist groups and upholding the common safety and development interests of all the countries in the region”.Friday’s attack comes a month after a suicide bomber attacked a bus carrying workers to a dam construction site in northern Pakistan, killing 13 people, including nine Chinese nationals.Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and ISI chief Faiz Hameed had rushed to China a week after the July attack.The frequent attacks on Chinese nationals and interests have cast a shadow over Chinese investment in Pakistan under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), one of the flagship projects under the Belt and Road Initiative.Beijing has invested billions in infrastructure projects in Pakistan as part of the CPEC, under its wider Belt and Road initiative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-must-arrest-those-behind-attack-that-injured-chinese-worker-foreign-min-101629720745972.html

It has lifted nearly 28,000 people since August 14 and 33,000 since July.The United States had planned to complete the evacuation of all American citizens, allies and Afghan partners by August 31, a deadline posted by Biden for ending America’s longest war.But those plans did not factor in the unexpectedly early collapse of the Kabul government. And the swift return of the Taliban triggered a rush on the airport of Afghans eager to flee the country, specially those who had worked with US and allied forces and now feared reprisal from the Taliban.Facing withering criticism of the chaotic evacuations, Biden has sought to reassure Americans no American or Afghan partner will be left behind, as the president indicated before in an interview to ABC, the US could stay beyond the August-end deadline.The US is also expanding the safe zone around the airport to allow easier access for Americans and Afghans trying to get inside amid reports massive crowd and efforts by Taliban fighters who are manning approach roads to prevent Afghans from leaving.“We have constantly - how can I say - increased rational access to the airport, where more folks can get there, more safely is still a dangerous operation but I don’t want to go into the detailed,” Biden said in response to a question, as he refused to divulge more details for security reasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-raises-possibility-of-us-staying-beyond-august-end-101629718524612.html

23-08-2021||World||Kamala Harris Asia tour: Singapore offers tanker aircraft to US for Afghan evacuation||Singapore on Monday offered America one of its tanker aircraft to airlift stranded civilians from war-torn Afghanistan, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said as he held talks with US Vice President Kamala Harris during which the two countries signed a number of key agreements to enhance cooperation, including in defence and cybersecurity.Vice President Harris' visit to Singapore is part of a diplomatic charm offensive by the Biden administration in Southeast Asia, a region that is crucial to the future prosperity and security of the United States, amidst China's aggressive actions in the region.Harris thanked Lee for the “very generous offer” to assist the US in its evacuations from Afghanistan.“We look forward to following up on that discussion,” she said.The A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft of the Singapore Air Force, which attained full operational capability in April, is capable of conducting air-to-air refuelling and airlift roles simultaneously.It enhances the Singapore Armed Forces' ability to contribute to international humanitarian assistance and disaster relief missions, and peace support operations.Lee, at a press conference held along with Harris, said that the safety and security of the civilians is on the minds of everyone all over the world, and that he hopes that all sides there can work to ensure this.The MRTT aircraft of the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) can carry up to 266 passengers or 37,000 kgs of cargo, and can be used to evacuate sick or injured personnel.“I mentioned to Vice President (Harris) that we knew that the US was conducting an evacuation operation of refugees from Afghanistan, and Singapore would like to offer to the US the use of (RSAF's MRTT) aircraft in order to help with the airlift,” said Lee.The US is evacuating Americans from Kabul which fell to the Taliban on August 15.Lee noted that Singapore is not unfamiliar with the challenges, and that the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) have deployed personnel there in support of the International Security Assistance Force (ISEF).The ISEF was an international military mission in Afghanistan, established by the United Nations Security Council, to train the Afghan National Security Forces and assist the country in rebuilding key government institutions.Singapore has sent personnel to Afghanistan because it is a key battlefront in the global fight against extremist terrorism, Lee said, noting that extremist ideas and capabilities have been exported from there to the region here.The Prime Minister said that the US’ intervention in the region 20 years ago has stopped terrorist groups from using Afghanistan as a safe base.“For this, Singapore is grateful. We hope Afghanistan does not become an epicentre for terrorism again,” he said.Meanwhile, the US and Singapore have signed three Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) to expand cooperation on cybersecurity in the public, defence and financial sectors.The MoUs were signed during the US Vice President’s official visit to Singapore, where she is looking to deepen bilateral cooperation in multiple areas, including defence and cybersecurity.The first MoU was signed by Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) chief executive David Koh and director of the US’ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Jen Easterly. It builds on a similar pact signed in 2016.This MoU will establish cooperation in areas like regular exchange of information on cyber threats, coordination of response to cybersecurity incidents, and joint cybersecurity training and exercises, the CSA said in a statement.It also covers mutual guidance on prevailing cybersecurity trends and best practices, joint cooperation in capacity building activities as well as raising cybersecurity awareness among respective constituents.Koh said Singapore and the US share “deep mutual interests” in improving cybersecurity cooperation, particularly as cybersecurity has become a “key enabler” for both countries to utilise the benefits of digitalisation to grow their economies and improve lives.Easterly said the borderless nature of cyber threats makes international collaboration a “key part” of the current US administration’s approach to cybersecurity.“The MoU allows us to strengthen our existing partnership with Singapore so that we can more effectively work together to collectively defend against the threats of today and secure against the risks of tomorrow,” she said.The CSA said the pact will expand into new areas of cooperation, like critical technologies as well as research and development.Separately, Singapore’s Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and the US’ Department of Defence also signed an MoU on cyberspace cooperation, aimed at institutionalising cyber cooperation between both defence establishments.Signed on August 20, the pact will improve cooperation in information sharing, ops-to-ops and technical exchanges, as well as collaboration in regional capacity building efforts."Such cooperation and engagements are professionally valuable, and help to build mutual understanding, and facilitate info-sharing and collaboration between trusted partners in capacity-building efforts," MINDEF said in a statement.The MoU concerning cooperation in cyberspace was signed by Chief of Defence Force Lieutenant-General Melvyn Ong, Commander of the United States Indo-Pacific Command Admiral John Aquilino and Commander of the US Cyber Command General Paul Nakasone.A third MoU on cybersecurity cooperation was signed between Singapore’s Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the US’ Department of the Treasury, aimed at maintaining and strengthening bilateral institutional ties.The agreement, signed on August 11, will cover information sharing related to the financial sector. This includes cybersecurity regulations and guidance, cybersecurity incidents, and cybersecurity threat intelligence.There will also be staff training and study visits, as well as competency-building activities including the conduct of cross-border cybersecurity exercises, the MAS said in a statement.Meanwhile, the US and Singapore have agreed to a partnership to better collaborate on climate action, environmental governance, sustainable development and low-carbon solutions.The US-Singapore Climate Partnership will "create opportunities for businesses and workers" in green growth sectors, including in energy transitions, clean energy infrastructure development, sustainable transport, sustainable finance and quality carbon credits markets, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI).Climate change is one area in which Harris is looking to deepen bilateral cooperation, senior US administration officials had earlier said. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic, cybersecurity, defence and digital trade are the others.In February, Singapore unveiled the Green Plan 2030, a "whole of nation movement" to advance sustainable development. One area of focus is growing the green economy to create new jobs, transform industries and use sustainability as a competitive advantage.The MTI called climate change a "critical global challenge" and a top priority for Singapore and the US, saying that sustainability and economic growth can go "hand in hand"."Both countries support global efforts to address this key challenge and are fully committed to implementing our commitments under the Paris Agreement and taking bold climate actions."By mainstreaming sustainability into the global economy, we can work together towards greater benefits and opportunities for Singapore, the US and the region,” it said.Potential areas of cooperation under the partnership include sustainable finance, energy transitions and quality carbon credit markets.Sustainable finance includes the use of private capital for sustainable infrastructure and environmental risk management in the financial sector, while energy transitions include sustainable transport.The partnership could also involve expert consultations on the setting of green standards and the management of environmental financial risks."Both countries will continue to explore opportunities to strengthen our collaboration in more areas of climate change and the green economy, in line with our mutual interests," the MTI said.Singapore and the US will also launch two new programmes next year on helping cities become more sustainable through the lowering of emissions.The programmes will improve knowledge sharing and collaboration between Singapore, US and other Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members through the ASEAN Smart Cities Network, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said in a statement."Upscaling green digital solutions will also maximise the benefits of technology from the digital revolution," the ministry added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-asia-tour-singapore-offers-tanker-aircraft-to-us-for-afghan-evacuation-101629709301914.html

The insurgents captured Kabul last Sunday amid the ongoing withdrawal of the American soldiers from Afghanistan, thus seizing power for the second time. Earlier, they ruled from 1996-2001 but were then defeated by the US-led troops who arrived here following the 9/11 attacks. Since then, the Americans have been in Afghanistan for nearly two decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-warns-us-of-serious-consequences-if-august-31-deadline-extended-101629708133818.html
23-08-2021||World||Taliban flags proliferate as Afghan tricolour becomes resistance symbol||After two decades out of power, the Taliban are swiftly moving to stamp their authority on Afghanistan using every tool at their disposal -- including flags.Since rolling into Kabul a week ago, the white banner of the Islamist militants has become a common sight across the country, replacing the national tricolour flag above government buildings, police stations and military facilities.There have been scattered reports of people being castigated or even punished for waving the old national banner, but so far there is no official word from the group on the flag issue.At a Kabul roadside on Sunday, vendors were making a quick sale in Taliban flags -- a white banner bearing the Muslim proclamation of faith and the regime's formal name: "Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan"."Our goal is to spread the flag of the Islamic Emirate throughout Afghanistan, instead of the tricolour flag," said vendor Ahmad Shakib, who studies economics at university.It was not clear if he was affiliated with the Taliban.The sight of Taliban fighters in vehicles bearing the standard has terrorised people across Afghanistan in recent weeks as the militants first captured vast swathes of the rural hinterland and then all the major cities.The group was quick to replace the Afghan national flag wherever it could.But in the middle of the despair and fear sparked by the Taliban takeover, the old flag has become something of a symbol of defiance for many, featuring prominently in the small protests held in recent days.'My heart is here'Social media has been awash with images and emojis of the old flag -- a black, red and green vertical tricolour with the national emblem overlaid in white -- posted by public figures including sports stars and many ordinary Afghans.On Afghanistan's independence day last week, groups of people waved the national flag in Kabul and a handful of suburbs to celebrate -- sometimes in plain sight of patrolling Taliban.At one rally, people on a convoy of honking cars waved national flags in Kabul. At another spot, men and women stood by the roadside holding the tricolour banner.A day earlier, Taliban fighters fired guns to disperse dozens in the eastern city of Jalalabad who were protesting over the removal of the national flag, according to local media."My heart is here for this flag... I will never leave this flag," said one Jalalabad resident."Kill us, fire at us... We will never leave this flag."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-flags-proliferate-as-afghan-tricolour-becomes-resistance-symbol-101629702969216.html
23-08-2021||World||‘You’re not a cow or horse’: FDA warns against using Ivermectin to treat Covid||The US recently issued a strong warning against the use of Ivermectin to treat patients of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In a statement, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it has not approved Ivermectin for use in treating or preventing Covid-19 in humans as it is not a drug for treating viruses. “You are not a horse. You are not a cow. Seriously, y’all. Stop it,” the FDA was quoted as saying by Bloomberg on Saturday.The government body was sharply reacting towards the use of Ivermectin in Mississippi, the state worst hit by the Covid-19 pandemic across the United States. Several people were found using the drug to cure the viral disease. Mississippi’s health department issued a warning that over 70 per cent of the recent calls to the poison department were from people who took Ivermectin bought at livestock supply centres, Bloomberg further reported.What is Ivermectin?According to the US FDA’s website, Ivermectin tablets are approved to treat people who are suffering from intestinal strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis, two conditions caused by parasitic worms. Additionally, “some topical (on the skin) forms of ivermectin are approved to treat external parasites like head lice and for skin conditions such as rosacea,” the website said.Ivermectin is also used in animals such as horses and cows to prevent heartworm disease and specific internal and external parasites.However, it is important to note that Ivermectin used for treating animals is different when compared to using the drug for treating human beings. The FDA said the drug has been approved in only smaller doses for humans while it is given in high doses to animals. “Animal drugs are often highly concentrated because they are used for large animals like horses and cows, which can weigh a lot more than we do—a ton or more. Such high doses can be highly toxic in humans,” the FDA added.‘Ivermectin’ menace in MississippiAs mentioned earlier, Mississippi’s poison control centre has been seeing a rapid rise in calls where people have consumed Ivermectin- meant for treating animals, to treat the coronavirus disease. “The Mississippi Poison Control Center has received increased calls due to livestock or animal formulations of ivermectin taken to prevent or treat Covid-19 infection. Animal drugs are highly concentrated for large animals and can be highly toxic in humans. Do NOT take drugs made for animals in any form,” the department said in a Facebook post last Friday.The department also said that 85 per cent of the callers who took the drug had only mild symptoms but one person was “was instructed to seek further evaluation due to the amount of Ivermectin reportedly ingested.”Mississippi, apart from being the worst-hit state from Covid-19 across the United States, also has one of the lowest rates of vaccination. According to a report by ABC News, the state has been seeing a record surge in cases and hospitalisations. The Intensive Care Units (ICUs) are almost full to the brim.Even though the vaccination drive has picked up some speed in the state, only 45.1 per cent of the population has received the first vaccine dose compared to the national average of 60.5 per cent.(With Bloomberg inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/youre-not-a-cow-or-horse-fda-warns-against-using-ivermectin-to-treat-covid-101629703539607.html

23-08-2021||World||Taiwan rolls out first indigenous Covid vaccine amid criticism. All you need to know||Taiwan has developed its first indigenous vaccine against Covid-19, manufactured by biotechnology company Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corp. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen received her shot of the domestically-developed Covid-19 vaccine in capital Taipei on Monday. "It doesn't hurt, I'm in good spirits, and I'm going to continue working for the day," she later wrote on Facebook and gave it her stamp of approval.VIDEO: Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen receives a vaccine developed by Taiwanese firm Medigen - it's the island's first domestically developed Covid vaccine pic.twitter.com/FI0mrpbBeDThe vaccination program in the island nation was dependent on foreign-produced Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines till now.Read on to find out more about Medigen’s Covid-19 vaccine:1. The Taiwanese health ministry approved Medigen’s coronavirus vaccine for emergency use in July to reduce the country’s reliance on foreign manufactured vaccines, deliveries of which were marred by delays.2. Taiwan’s Food and Drug Administration said in an official statement that a 20 member panel had convened in July to approve the vaccine, but a two-member panel declined to approve the vaccine.3. The vaccine is yet to finish clinical trials and no efficacy data on it is available yet. The Taiwanese government has said studies conducted so far have shown that the vaccine works and the antibodies produced by it are three times higher than those produced by the AstraZeneca shot, reported Bloomberg.4. The shot has come under criticism who have alleged that the approval process was rushed. Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), mounted a fierce campaign to invalidate Medigen's authorisation by filing a lawsuit, which was rejected by a Taiwanese court last week.5. It is a recombinant protein vaccine that helps the body develop immunity by using the virus’ spike proteins. It belongs to the family of vaccines like Novovax and Covovax. Recombinant protein vaccines often require the use of adjuvants to generate a much stronger response.6. The Taiwanese government has said that citizens will have the freedom to choose their vaccines and no one will be forcibly administered Medigen’s indigenous jab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-rolls-out-first-indigenous-covid-vaccine-amid-criticism-all-you-need-to-know-101629699675109.html

The Taliban has sent hundreds of its fighters to the region, which is at the centre of the resistance against the insurgent group.Also Read: Taliban say 'hundreds of fighters' heading to Panjshir ValleyThe region is located 150 kilometres northeast of the capital Kabul, and hosts some senior members of the ousted government, like the deposed Vice President Amrullah Saleh, ex-Defence Minister Bismillah Mohammadi and National Resistance Front's Ahmad Massoud.Saleh has vowed to not bow before the Taliban, and has declared himself as the caretaker president since Ashraf Ghani fled Afghanistan. "Talibs have massed forces near the entrance of Panjshir a day after they got trapped in ambush zones of neighboring Andarab valley & hardly went out in one piece. Meanwhile Salang highway is closed by the forces of the Resistance. "There are terrains to be avoided". See you," he tweeted on Monday.Talibs have massed forces near the entrance of Panjshir a day after they got trapped in ambush zones of neighboring Andarab valley & hardly went out in one piece. Meanwhile Salang highway is closed by the forces of the Resistance. "There are terrains to be avoided". See you.The history of Panjshir Valley"Panjshir" means five lions. The name acknowledges a legend that says back in the 10th century, five brothers managed to contain the floodwaters. They built a dam for Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, it is said.Most of the valley's up to 150,000 inhabitants belong to the Tajik ethnic group, while the majority of the Taliban are Pashtuns.Saleh was born in Panjshir province and was trained there.Panjshir Valley has never been capturedThe resistance decided to make Panjshir Valley its base of operations because of the illustrious history - it was never captured by the Taliban during their earlier rule in the 1990s, nor by the Soviets a decade earlier.Also Read: What is Panjshir Resistance? 10 things to know about alliance against TalibanThe reason for that is the geographical advantage that Panjshir Valley has. Being tucked into the Hindu Kush mountain range, the valley can be accessed only through the narrow passage created by the Panjshir River, which makes it easier for the forces to defend it.The valley is also known for its emeralds, which were used in the past to finance the resistance movements against those in power.What happened after the withdrawal of the Soviets in 1989A civil war broke out in Afghanistan when the Soviets left, which the Taliban won. But Ahmad Shah Massoud, the country's most famed anti-Taliban fighter, launched a resistance against the Sunni Pashtun group and eventually succeeded in defending the Panjshir Valley.In fact, almost all of northeastern Afghanistan, up to the border with China and Tajikistan, was successfully defended by Massoud.He was assassinated by suspected al Qaeda terrorists in 2001.Son takes the batonAhmad Massoud, the son of Ahmad Shah, is now leading the resistance against the Taliban. He is joined by Saleh and other fighters from the region. Saleh has said that he will never betray the soul and legacy Ahmad Shah Massoud, who he called his "hero, the commander, the legend and the guide".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/panjshir-afghanistan-s-valley-of-resistance-remains-a-challenge-for-taliban-101629698923790.html

American and German forces are also involved in the gun battle and that all Bundeswehr members were uninjured, it added. There is no further information on who the attackers were as of now.Monday's incident took place after at least seven Afghans died in a panicked crush of people trying to enter Kabul’s international airport on Sunday, the British military said.After taking over the capital city, the Taliban are manning the outside perimeters of the Kabul airport. Thousands were still trying to flee the country in a chaotic exodus a week after the collapse of the Afghan government, leading to the Taliban military takeover.The United States and its allies withdrew troops from Afghanistan after a 20-year war aimed at overthrowing the Taliban and hunting down al Qaeda after the 9/11 attacks.The Biden administration had set August end as the deadline for the complete pullout of the troops, however, with the continuously evolving situation, the US President has said it could be extended. "We're executing a plan to move groups of these Americans to safety and to safely and effectively move them to the airport compound.

23-08-2021||World||Canada’s deputy PM in soup over controversial tweet||In the first major controversy of what has been a somewhat staid 2021 Federal election campaign so far, Twitter marked as manipulated media a tweet from Canada’s outgoing deputy prime minister, a post that was also retweeted by Liberal Party leader and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.The tweet from Chrystia Freeland, deputy prime minister and finance minister, took aim at Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole over the latter’s apparent preference for privatisation of Canada’s universal healthcare system, and she posted a video of a response from him to a question in this context. However, that video appears to have been spliced and was flagged by Twitter, but not before Trudeau had already retweeted it.Interestingly, while Freeland posted the same content in French and English, only the French version was flagged by Twitter. In the tweet, she wrote: “Canada’s public, universal health care system is one of our greatest strengths. It’s part of what makes us who we are as a country. Last year, as Covid-19 raged, Erin O’Toole was asked if he would bring private, “for-profit” healthcare to Canada. He responded unequivocally: “yes”.However, the person who asked him the question in July 2020, Kate Harrison responded to Freeland’s post stating she was “disappointed to see the video was manipulated to exclude important context”.“‘We need to ensure universal access remains paramount’. That’s a direct quote from O’Toole. It was edited from the original clip,” Harrison said.Another person, Laryssa Waler, posted a transcript of the original exchange, highlighting the parts that had been edited out of the clip that was posted by Freeland and accused her of trying to “mislead Canadians”.Harrison added, “The amateur cut and paste slapped together for this video is even more jarring when you look at what was used (and not used) in writing.”While still trailing the incumbent Liberals, the Conservative Party jumped on the opportunity afforded by Twitter’s action, unprecedented in Canadian politics, as it tweeted, “It’s disappointing to see the Liberals resort to American-style divisive politics. While Justin Trudeau and the Liberals are focused on spreading misinformation - Erin O’Toole is focused on Canada’s recovery plan and securing the future.”Trudeau is focusing upon healthcare, particularly his government’s measures to counter the challenge posted by the Covid-19 pandemic as the principal plank for the elections on September 20. In calling snap polls, his objective is to convert the minority that his party has in Parliament at this time into a majority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadas-deputy-pm-in-soup-over-controversial-tweet-101629694822611.html

In addition, our teams are communicating with companies that can execute rescue efforts on the ground in Afghanistan," it said.According to the United Sikhs, the 10-kilometer drive to the international airport in Kabul from Gurdwara Karte Parwan through various checkpoints is one of the biggest challenges in the rescue efforts. Few Afghan minority members have unsuccessfully attempted to make this trip last week, it said."We are ready to go to the airport, but we fear the cancellation of evacuation flights from the Kabul airport.

This led to massive chaos in the country and the deaths of several residents seeking to flee Afghanistan. Biden and his administration have also come under backlash for not strategising well to prevent the fallout and causing a humanitarian crisis in the war-torn country.Both Republicans and Democrats have criticised Biden and suggested that his adamant decision to pull out from Afghanistan and disregard concerns that the Taliban was quickly advancing across Afghanistan created a humanitarian disaster.Former US envoy to the United Nations Nikki Haley criticised Biden earlier in the day, saying, "the US administration has surrendered the American people and actually withdrew our troops before they withdrew the American people." "They have abandoned our Afghan allies who kept people like my husband safe while they were overseas deploying. So, no, there was no negotiating. This was a complete and total surrender and an embarrassing failure," she added.Meanwhile, Biden has rejected the uproar and stood by his decision. During Sunday's press conference as well, Biden reiterated it was the time to leave Afghanistan and there wasn't a way to evacuate people without chaos. "There is no way to evacuate this many people without pain and loss and the heartbreaking images you see, it’s just a fact. My heart aches for those people you see. At the end of the day, if we didn't leave Afghanistan now, when would we?" he said.The US president also warned that with the Taliban now controlling the country, there is a threat of ISIS and its Afgan affiliate known as ISIS-K. "We know that terrorists may seek to exploit the situation and target innocent Afghans or American troops. We’re maintaining constant vigilance to monitor and disrupt threats from any source, including ISIS, ISIS-K," Biden also said at the White House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/logical-rational-and-right-decision-biden-continues-to-defend-us-pullout-as-situation-deteriorates-in-afghanistan-101629692989680.html

Since then, more than 1,200 people in China have been confirmed to be infected.Also Read| Global Covid deaths estimated to reach 5.3 million by DecemberThe outbreak has spurred local authorities across the country to impose tough counter-epidemic measures including mass testing for millions of people to identify and isolate carriers, as well as treat the infected.No one has died in the current outbreak, which has largely focused on the cities of Nanjing and Yangzhou in the province of Jiangsu, near the financial hub of Shanghai.Across China, new local cases fell to the single-digits last week, after peaking in early August.But over the weekend, Shanghai placed hundreds of people under quarantine after infections were found in cargo workers at one of its two airports, sparking concerns of a fresh outbreak in the city.Shanghai has reported no new local infections since then.Also Read| China shoots down 2nd WHO probe into Covid virus originIncluding new infections detected among travellers arriving in mainland China, the National Health Commission reported on Monday a total of 21 new confirmed cases for Aug. 22, down from 32 a day earlier.China reported 16 new asymptomatic coronavirus cases, which it does not classify as confirmed infections until they show signs of infection such as a fever.

He called it the initial stage of the program."None of them will be landing in Kabul," he said.American Airlines, Atlas Air, Delta Air Lines and privately held Omni Air will provide three aircraft each. There are also two from Hawaiian Airlines, and four from United Airlines.American and Delta said they would start relief flights on Monday and, along with other carriers, welcomed the call to aid the U.S. military amid the humanitarian crisis."American ... is proud to fulfill its duty to help the U.S. military scale this humanitarian and diplomatic rescue mission. The images from Afghanistan are heartbreaking," it said in a statement.Biden said the operation should have only a minimal effect on commercial flights.Delta said its commercial operations were unaffected, while American said it "will work to minimize the impact to customers as the airline temporarily removes these aircraft from our operation." United said it was still assessing the impact but expected it "to be minimal."Atlas Air said it would carry evacuees to the United States "and will be standing by should additional capacity be needed."'CIVIL RESERVE AIR FLEET'In the 12 hours up to 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Sunday, about 3,400 people were evacuated from Kabul on 39 coalition aircraft, including commercial airlines, and 1,700 others on eight U.S. military flights, according to the White House. Altogether, about 30,300 people have been evacuated since Aug. 14, it added.Bahrain's national carrier, Gulf Air, operated a flight from Isa Air Base to Dulles International Airport outside Washington as part of the evacuation efforts, Bahrain's government's media office, NCC, said on Sunday.The United States last utilized the "Civil Reserve Air Fleet" in the period leading up to and including the invasion of Iraq and prior to that, the 1991 Gulf War.The limited number of aircraft is just one of the issues facing the evacuation from Afghanistan that has evacuees being sent to a dozen countries.Officials have said they are also frustrated with slow processing by the Department of Homeland Security and State Department, and there is increasing concern about security in Kabul.The United States and its allies have brought in several thousand troops to manage the evacuations of foreign citizens and vulnerable Afghans, but have stayed away from areas outside of the Kabul airport.White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN the United States had "secured the capacity to get large numbers of Americans safe passage through the airport and onto the airfield" in Afghanistan, but gave no details.Last week, the U.S. military used three military helicopters to bring 169 Americans to the Kabul airport from a building just 650 feet (200 m) away. Officials say that type of operation is expected to continue.Biden said he directed the State Department to contact Americans stranded in Afghanistan by phone, email and other means and that the United States was “executing a plan” to move them to the Kabul airport.“I will say again today what I’ve said before: Any American who wants to get home will get home," Biden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hires-commercial-airlines-to-help-fly-afghanistan-evacuees-101629684952592.html

This Israeli study has answers||Data from Israel shows a booster shot of Pfizer Inc’s Covid-19 vaccine has significantly improved immunity and offered protection from serious illness among people aged 60 and above, as the US and other countries have announced plans to give additional doses amid the spread of highly infectious Delta variant.The United States has announced plans to offer booster shots to all Americans, citing data showing diminishing protection and Canada, France and Germany have also announced booster campaigns.Findings published by Israel’s health ministry showed on Sunday that the protection against infection provided from 10 days after a third dose was four times higher than after two doses among those aged 60 and over. It also showed that the third jab for over 60-year-olds offered five to six times greater protection after 10 days with regard to serious illness and hospitalisation. That age group is particularly vulnerable to Covid-19 and in Israel, it was the first to be vaccinated against Covid-19 when the inoculation drive began in late December.Also read | 'Don't have enough data': Dr Guleria on if Covid vaccine booster needed in IndiaThe data were presented at a meeting of a ministry panel of vaccination experts on Thursday and uploaded to its website on Sunday. However, the full details of the study have not been released.Last week, Maccabi Health Services, one of several organisations administering booster shots to try to curb the Delta variant, also had similar findings with separate statistics.Maccabi Health Services in a study released last Wednesday said that the booster shot reduced the risk of infection in the 60-plus age group by 86 per cent and against severe infection by 92 per cent. The findings by Maccabi are based on real-world data from a relatively large group. Pfizer and Moderna Inc have also said their own studies showed a booster shot would improve protection.Also read | US CDC delays review of Covid booster shots as debate swirls over third jabIsrael’s health ministry has said that immunity has diminished over time for the elderly in the country as well as the young. Most vaccinated people who fell severely ill in Israel were over 60 and had underlying health conditions.Israel started administering the third dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to those over 60-year-olds on July 30. It has now revised the age of eligibility for a booster to 40 and also said that pregnant women, teachers and health care workers below that age can also get the third shot. Third doses are given only to those who received their second shot at least five months ago.Israel, which has been fighting an outbreak of the Delta variant since June, has one of the world's highest infection rates per capita.

23-08-2021||World||Joe Biden says US-led evacuation from Kabul is accelerating||President Joe Biden said Sunday the U.S.-led evacuation of Americans, at-risk Afghans and others from the Kabul airport accelerated this weekend, although it remains vulnerable to threats posed by the Islamic State extremist group.One week after the Taliban completed its takeover of Afghanistan by capturing Kabul, Biden said discussions are underway among military officials about potentially extending the airlift beyond Biden's Aug. 31 deadline. “Our hope is we will not have to extend, but there are discussions,” he said, suggesting the possibility that the Taliban will be consulted.Since Aug. 14, one day before the Taliban entered Kabul, the airlift has evacuated 28,000 people, Biden said. He said that included 11,000 who had departed from Kabul in a 36-hour period this weekend, but he did not provide details. The number appeared to include flights by charter and non-U.S. military aircraft as well as the U.S. Air Force C-17 and C-130 transport planes that have been flying daily from the capital. The U.S. military is controlling air traffic on both the civilian and military sides of the airport.Tens of thousands of people remain to join the airlift, which has been slowed by security issues and U.S. bureaucracy hurdles.Biden asserted, without a full explanation, that U.S. forces have managed to improve access to the airport for Americans and others seeking to get on flights. He suggested that the perimeter had been extended, widening a “safe zone.”“What I’m not going to do is talk about the tactical changes we’re making to make sure we maintain as much security as we can," he said. "We have constantly, how can I say it, increased rational access to the airport, where more folk can get there more safely. It's still a dangerous operation but I don’t want to go into the detail of how we’re doing that.”Later Biden added: “We've discussed a lot with the Taliban. They’ve been cooperative in extending some of the perimeter.”He said groups of Americans in Kabul are being moved more efficiently and safely to the airport, but he provided no details.“Any American who wants to get home, will get home,” he asserted.Earlier Sunday, administration officials said the U.S. military is considering “creative ways” to get Americans and others into the Kabul airport for evacuation from Afghanistan amid “acute” security threats, and the Pentagon on Sunday ordered six U.S. commercial airlines to help move evacuees from temporary sites outside of Afghanistan.Addressing a criticism cited by many Republicans, Biden said no Afghan evacuees are being flown directly to the United States from Afghanistan without prior screening. He said they are being screened in third countries.Biden and his top aides have repeatedly cited their concern that extremist groups in Afghanistan will attempt to exploit the chaos around the Kabul airport.“The threat is real, it is acute, it is persistent and something we’re focused with every tool in our arsenal," said Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan.Sullivan said on CNN's “State of the Union” that 3,900 people had been airlifted out of Kabul on U.S. military flights over the past 24 hours. A U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to provide details not yet made public, said those people were flown on a total of 23 flights — 14 by C-17 transports and nine aboard C-130 cargo planes.That represents an increase from 1,600 flown out aboard U.S. military planes in the previous 24 hours, but remains far below the 5,000 to 9,000 that the military says it has the capacity to airlift daily. Sullivan also said about 3,900 people were airlifted on non-U.S. military flights over the past 24 hours.The Biden administration has given no firm estimate of the number of Americans seeking to leave Afghanistan. Some have put the total between 10,000 and 15.000. Sullivan on Sunday put it at “several thousand.”Speaking on ABC’s “This Week,” Austin said that as Biden’s Aug. 31 deadline for ending the evacuation operation approaches, he will recommend whether to give it more time. Tens of thousands of Americans and others have yet to be flown out of the country.Austin’s interview with ABC aired Sunday but was taped Saturday. In a notice Sunday, the State Department urged people seeking to leave Afghanistan as part of an organized private evacuation effort not come to the Kabul airport “until you have received specific instructions” to do so from the U.S. Embassy’s flight organizer. The notice said that others, including American citizens, who have received specific instructions from the embassy to make their way to the airport should do so.Austin said the airlift would continue for as long as possible.“We’re gonna try our very best to get everybody, every American citizen who wants to get out, out,” Austin said in the interview. “And we’ve got -- we continue to look at different ways to -- in creative ways -- to reach out and contact American citizens and help them get into the airfield.”The British military said Sunday another seven people had been killed in the unceasing crush of crowds outside the airport.Republicans in Congress stepped up their criticism of Biden's response. “If the Taliban is saying that Americans can travel safely to the airport, then there is no better way to make sure they get safely to the airport than to use our military to escort them,” GOP Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, an Army veteran, said on ABC's “This Week.”Ryan Crocker, who served as U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan under Presidents George W, Bush and Barack Obama, told CBS' “Face the Nation” that Biden’s management of the withdrawal was “catastrophic” and had unleashed a “global crisis.”A central problem in the evacuation operation is processing evacuees once they reach other countries in the region and in Europe. Those temporary waystations, including in Qatar, Bahrain and Germany, are sometimes reaching capacity, although new sites are being made available, including in Spain.In an attempt to alleviate that, and to free up military aircraft for missions from Kabul, the Pentagon on Sunday activated the Civil Reserve Air Fleet. The Defense Department said 18 aircraft from American Airlines, Atlas Air, Delta Air Lines, Omni Air, Hawaiian Airlines and United Airlines will be directed to ferry evacuees from interim waystations. The airlines will not fly into Afghanistan. The six participating airlines have agreed to assist for a little less than two weeks, which roughly coincides with the currently planned duration of the airlift, which is to end Aug. 31.The civil airline reserve system was last activated in 2003 for the Iraq War. The commercial airliners will retain their civilian status but the military's Air Mobility Command will control the flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-us-led-evacuation-from-kabul-is-accelerating-101629678979649.html

The tweet came along with a 14-second video clip showing a column of captured trucks with the white Taliban flags moving along a highway.مئات من مجاهدي #الإمارة_الإسلامية يتوجهون نحو ولاية #بنجشير للسيطرة عليها، بعد رفض مسئولي الولاية المحليين تسليمها بشكل سلمي. pic.twitter.com/FwAYBZeopqMassoud, the son of Ahmad Shah Massoud, one of the main leaders of Afghanistan's anti-Soviet resistance in the 1980s, said his supporters were ready to fight if the Taliban tried to invade the Panjshir Valley. "We want to make the Taliban realise that the only way forward is through negotiation. We do not want a war to break out,” he told Reuters by telephone from his stronghold in the Panjshir Valley northwest of Kabul.He and Amrullah Saleh, the country's vice president, have gathered forces made up of remnants of regular army units and special forces as well as local militia fighters. "They want to defend, they want to fight, they want to resist against any totalitarian regime,” he told Reuters.Also read | 'If Taliban launch a full-scale attack on Panjshir...': What analysts sayReuters reported that there was some uncertainty about whether the Taliban have begun their operation. It cited a Taliban official as saying that an offensive had been launched on Panjshir but one of Massoud’s aides said there were no signs that the column had actually entered the narrow pass into the valley and there had been no reports of fighting.Also watch | Anti-Taliban fighters train in Panjshir; Ahmad Massoud seeks West's helpExperts have said that the resistance fighters gathered at Panjshir Valley will have to struggle if the Islamist hardliners launch a full-scale attack. “The resistance for the moment is just verbal because the Taliban have not yet tried to enter the Panjshir. The Taliban only need to lock down the Panjshir, they don't even have to go in there,” Dorronsoro told news agency AFP. "The Taliban surround Panjshir from all sides and I don't think Massoud's son can resist much more than a couple of months. For the moment, he does not have any really strong support," Abdul Sayed, an independent researcher, told AFP.Also read | Ahmad Massoud, son of assassinated anti-Taliban fighter, calls for supportAnti-Taliban forces took back three districts in the northern province of Baghlan, bordering Panjshir last week.

23-08-2021||World||Henri soaks New England with rain, wind after roaring ashore||Tropical Storm Henri, downgraded at sea from a hurricane, is soaking the U.S. Northeast with rain after it came ashore in Rhode Island. The storm is leaving a trail of power outages and flooded roadways from New Jersey to Massachusetts.Henri drove the ocean 1-to-2 feet (30-to-60 centimeters) higher as it made landfall near Westerly, Rhode Island, with top winds of 60 miles (95 kilometers) per hour. It was southeast of Hartford Connecticut at 5 p.m. local time, lumbering along at 7 miles an hour, according to the National Hurricane Center. “While New Englanders are used to dealing with some tough weather, this storm has the potential for widespread consequences throughout the region, with significant flooding and power outages,” President Joe Biden said at a news conference at the White House Saturday afternoon. “We don’t know the full extent of the storm’s impact today, but we’re acting to prepare for and prevent damage as much as possible.”Henri is the latest in a grim parade of extreme weather events worldwide as climate change takes hold. Massive wildfires have blackened huge swaths of California, Greece, Algeria and Siberia, sending smoke over the North Pole for the first time on record. July was the hottest month ever recorded on Earth.And in a separate major event, heavy rain fell across western and central Tennessee late Friday into Saturday, dropping as much as 17.02 inches (43 centimeters) in McEwen, a small town west of Nashville, said Brian Hurley, a senior branch forecaster at the U.S. Weather Prediction Center. At least 22 people died in the resulting floods, according to the Associated Press.Henri is the fifth storm to hit the U.S. in 2021 and the eighth to form in the Atlantic. Henri is expected to linger across southern New England bringing as much as 6 inches of rain to a landscape that has been drenched by weeks of downpours. It will then sweep across southern Maine and head for the Canadian Maritimes.Flooding has been reported across the Northeast, disrupting transportation. Amtrak canceled trains between New York and Boston. Some subway tunnels were inundated in New York City. And about 1,000 flights were canceled as of 11 a.m., mostly in Boston and Newark, New Jersey, according to Flight Aware, an airline tracking service. More than 125,000 homes and businesses are without power across the region, according to Poweroutage.us, which tracks outages. More than 13,500 utility workers from dozens of states are on standby to help restore power, according to the Edison Electric Institute, a utility trade group. As early as Sunday morning, Henri was still a hurricane, with top winds of 75 mph. But it lost power on its final approach. “It didn’t come in as ferocious as predicted,” said Jim Rouiller, lead meteorologist at the Energy Weather Group. “I was expecting a bit more out of it but it really hasn’t materialized.”A continental storm coming across Pennsylvania seems to have sapped some of Henri’s energy and moisture, Rouiller said. It also helped slow Henri down as it crossed an area of cooler water that robbed it of its strength.Hurricanes and tropical storms depend on warm ocean water to build power and maintain strength. The cooler water has just the opposite effect and that could mean that the feared flooding and power outage won’t be as bad.But flooding could still be severe, and officials braced for the worst. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Saturday declared a state of emergency, and thousands of residents and holiday-makers evacuated beach communities -- or in some cases, opted to hunker down. A mandatory evacuation order was issued for some residents nearest the coast in Madison, Connecticut, across Long Island Sound. President Biden approved emergency declarations for Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York and ordered federal assistance. He authorized the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate all disaster relief efforts. The Coast Guard ordered ports in Southeastern New England to shut, and established a safety zone for the Port of Narragansett, Mount Hope, Buzzards Bay, and Cape Cod Bay. In New York and New Jersey, authorities will implement vessel traffic control measures and limit movement.Henri probably won’t produce anywhere near the $77 billion in damages that Superstorm Sandy caused in 2012, but it poses a significant threat to transportation and power networks, and is set to unleash potentially deadly storm surges.The winds, rain and surge damage could reach at least $1 billion in losses, said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research. Many of those costs will be absorbed by residents, who will make repairs themselves or because the damage won’t reach insurance deductibles. Insured losses will probably top out at $500 million, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/henri-soaks-new-england-with-rain-wind-after-roaring-ashore-101629675264059.html
23-08-2021||World||22 dead, many missing after 17 inches of rain in Tennessee||At least 22 people were killed and rescue crews searched desperately Sunday amid shattered homes and tangled debris for dozens of people still missing after record-breaking rain sent floodwaters surging through Middle Tennessee.Saturday's flooding in rural areas took out roads, cellphone towers and telephone lines, leaving families uncertain about whether their loved ones survived the unprecedented deluge. Emergency workers were searching door to door, said Kristi Brown, a coordinator for health and safety supervisor with Humphreys County Schools.Many of the missing live in the neighborhoods where the water rose the fastest, Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis said. Their names were on a board in the county’s emergency center and listed on a city department's Facebook page.“I would expect, given the number of fatalities, that we’re going to see mostly recovery efforts at this point rather than rescue efforts," Tennessee Emergency Management Director Patrick Sheehan said.The dead included twin toddlers who were swept from their father’s arms, according to surviving family members, and a foreman at county music star Loretta Lynn's ranch. The sheriff of the county of about 18,000 people some 60 miles (96 kilometers) west of Nashville said he lost one of his best friends.Up to 17 inches (43 centimeters) of rain fell in Humphreys County in less than 24 hours Saturday, shattering the Tennessee record for one-day rainfall by more than 3 inches (8 centimeters), the National Weather Service said.Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee toured the area, calling it a “devastating picture of loss and heartache." He stopping on Main Street in Waverly where some homes were washed off their foundations and people were sifting though their water-logged possessions. All around the county were debris from wrecked cars, demolished businesses and homes and a chaotic, tangled mix of the things inside.Shirley Foster cried as the governor walked up. She said she just learned a friend from her church was dead.“I thought I was over the shock of all this. I’m just tore up over my friend. My house is nothing, but my friend is gone,” Foster told the governor.The hardest-hit areas saw double the rain that area of Middle Tennessee had in the previous worst-case scenario for flooding, meteorologists said. Lines of storms moved over the area for hours, wringing out a record amount of moisture — a scenario scientists have warned may be more common because of global warming.The downpours rapidly turned the creeks that run behind backyards and through downtown Waverly into raging rapids. Business owner Kansas Klein stood on a bridge Saturday in the town of 4,500 people and saw two girls who were holding on to a puppy and clinging to a wooden board sweep past, the current too fast for anyone to grab them. He hadn't found out what happened to them.Not far from the bridge, Klein told The Associated Press by phone that dozens of buildings in a low-income housing area known as Brookside appeared to have borne the brunt of the flash flood from Trent Creek.“It was devastating: buildings were knocked down, half of them were destroyed,” Klein said. “People were pulling out bodies of people who had drowned and didn’t make it out.”The Humphreys County Sheriff Office Facebook page filled with people looking fo r missing friends and family. GoFundMe pages were made asking for help for funeral expenses for the dead, including 7-month-old twins yanked from their father’s arms as they tried to escape.The foreman at Lynn's ranch, Wayne Spears, also was killed.“He’s out at his barn and next thing you know, he goes from checking animals in the barn to hanging on in the barn to people seeing him floating down the creek. And that’s how fast it had come up," the sheriff said.A photo taken by someone at the ranch showed Spears in a cowboy hat clinging to a pillar in brown, churning water up to his chest.“Wayne’s just one of those guys, he just does everything for everybody, if there’s a job to do,” said his friend Michael Pate, who met Spears at the ranch 15 years ago.At the Cash Saver grocery in in Waverly, employees stood on desks, registers and a flower rack as the waters from the creek that's usually 400 feet (120 meters) from the store rushed in after devastating the low income housing next door. At one point, they tried to break through the celling into the attic and couldn't, store co-owner David Hensley said.The flood waters stopped rising as fast just as the situation was getting dire and a rescue boat came by. “We told him that if there’s somebody else out there you can get, go get them, we think we’re OK,” Hensley said.At the beginning of a news conference on Tropical Storm Henri's impact on New England, President Joe Biden offered condolences to the people of Tennessee and directed federal disaster officials to talk with the governor and offer assistance.Just to the east of Waverly, the town of McEwen was pummeled Saturday with 17.02 inches (43.2 centimeters) of rain, smashing the state’s 24-hour record of 13.6 inches (34.5 centimeters) from 1982, according to the National Weather Service in Nashville, though Saturday’s numbers would have to be confirmed.A flash flood watch was issued for the area before the rain started, with forecasters saying 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters) of rain was possible. The worst storm recorded in this area of Middle Tennessee only dropped 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain, said Krissy Hurley, a weather service meteorologist in Nashville.“Forecasting almost a record is something we don’t do very often,” Hurley said. “Double the amount we’ve ever seen was almost unfathomable.”Recent scientific research has determined that extreme rain events will become more frequent because of man-made climate change. Hurley said it is impossible to know its exact role in Saturday’s flood, but noted in the past year her office dealt with floods that used to be expected maybe once every 100 years in September south of Nashville and in March closer to the city.“We had an incredible amount of water in the atmosphere,” Hurley said of Saturday’s flooding. “Thunderstorms developed and moved across the same area over and over and over.”The problem isn’t limited to Tennessee. A federal study found man-made climate change doubles the chances of the types of heavy downpours that in August 2016 dumped 26 inches (66 centimeters) of rain around Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Those floods killed at least 13 people and damaged 150,000 homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/22-dead-many-missing-after-17-inches-of-rain-in-tennessee-101629675158003.html
23-08-2021||World||Tropical storm closes in on US coast||Tropical Storm Henri steamed towards the northeastern US coastline on Sunday morning, packing high winds and heavy rains that were projected to leave a wide swath of devastation from New Jersey and New York to Massachusetts.The storm was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm but still packed wind gusts of up to 120kmph. Officials warned of the danger of widespread flooding in inland areas as the storm was expected to sweep west from the coast before turning back to the Northeast. Millions on New York’s Long Island and in southern New England braced for the possibility of flooding, toppled trees and power outages.10 killed in Tennessee floods, dozens missingFlooding in Middle Tennessee left at least ten people dead and dozens missing on Saturday as record-shattering rainfall washed away homes and rural roads, authorities said.Hurricane Grace kills 8 including kids in MexicoHurricane Grace killed at least eight people, including five children from the same family, as it tore through eastern Mexico on Saturday, causing flooding, mudslides and damage to homes and businesses.The storm made landfall in Mexico for a second time near Tecolutla in Veracruz state as a major Category Three storm with winds of 200kmph.It later fizzled out as it moved inland over the central highlands, but not before causing widespread damage. In the Veracruz state capital, Xalapa, streets were turned into muddy brown rivers. Seven people died there and one more in the city of Poza Rica, Veracruz governor Cuitlahuac Garcia said. The victims included a mother and five of her children, who were buried when a hillside collapsed on their small home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-closes-in-on-us-coast-101629661691091.html
23-08-2021||World||Airport in Kabul still tense as 7 die in panicked crush||At least seven Afghans died in a panicked crush of people trying to enter Kabul’s international airport since the Taliban takeover, the British military said on Sunday, as thousands were still trying to flee the country in a chaotic exodus.The Taliban moved to confront the first stirrings of armed resistance since capturing nearly all of Afghanistan in a matter of days earlier this month. Anti-Taliban fighters claimed to have seized three mountainous districts, and a prominent militia commander in the only province not yet under Taliban control pledged to fight back if attacked.The British military on Sunday acknowledged at least seven deaths at the airport. Others may have been trampled, suffocated or suffered heart attacks as Taliban fighters fired into the air to try to drive back the crowds. Soldiers covered several corpses in white clothing.A Nato official said at least 20 people have died in the past seven days in and around the airport. Some were shot and others died in stampedes, witnesses have said. “The situation at Kabul airport remains extremely challenging and unpredictable,” the Nato official said.Kabul’s airport has seen days of chaos since the Taliban entered the capital on August 15. Thousands poured onto the tarmac last week, and several Afghans plunged to their deaths after clinging to a US military cargo plane as it took off, some of the seven killed on August 16.The US embassy, which has relocated to the military side of the airport, has told American citizens and others not to come to the airport until they receive precise instructions.Taliban blame evacuation crisis on US militaryThe Taliban blamed the chaotic evacuation on the US military, saying there’s no need for Afghans to be afraid, even though their fighters are beating people with batons as they try to control the crowds outside the airport. “All Afghanistan is secure, but the airport, which is managed by the Americans, has anarchy,” Amir Khan Motaqi, a senior Taliban official, said.Speaking to an Iranian state TV channel in a video call, Taliban spokesman Mohammad Naeem blamed the deaths at the airport on the Americans.Meanwhile, the Taliban’s top political leader arrived in Kabul for talks on forming a new government. The presence of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, who returned to Kandahar earlier this week from Qatar, was confirmed by a Taliban official.American airlines told to help with airlift effortsThe US on Sunday enlisted several major airlines in its frantic evacuation of tens of thousands of Afghans, Americans and other foreigners from Kabul. Defence secretary Lloyd Austin activated the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) to aid the onward movement of people arriving at US bases in West Asia, the Pentagon said.Baradar in Kabul, talks on over govt formationTaliban leaders are meanwhile trying to hammer out a new government, and the group’s co-founder, Mullah Baradar, has arrived in Kabul for talks.In Moscow, President Vladimir Putin said the conflict affects the security situation in Russia. He slammed an idea of western countries to send refugees to Central Asian countries while their visas to the US and Europe are being processed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airport-in-kabul-still-tense-as-7-die-in-panicked-crush-101629661496477.html
23-08-2021||India||Bihar all-party delegation meets Modi, pushes for caste-based census in India||An all–party delegation from Bihar led by chief minister Nitish Kumar called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday to push for a caste-based census, saying they were satisfied with a “patient hearing” but underlining that the final decision rested with the PM.Members of 11 parties, including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), met Modi for around 40 minutes.Speaking to media after the event, Kumar, whose party runs a coalition government with the BJP in Bihar, said a demand for caste-based enumeration existed not just in his state but also the rest of the country. “We are grateful to the Prime Minister for listening to us. Now, he has to take a decision,” he said.The meeting happened in the backdrop of mounting pressure on the Centre to accept the demand for a caste census ahead of critical elections in seven states next year. “There is likelihood of another set of parties meeting the PM on the same issue,” said a person aware of details.Another person familiar with what happened during the meeting said the PM heard arguments put forth by the delegation. “He did not question what was explained by the leaders, but said the issue comes under the purview of the home ministry and will have to be discussed with the home minister as well,” this person added. A delegation of JD(U) members called on home minister Amit Shah earlier this month to discuss the issue.Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav, who has joined hands with bitter rival Kumar to press for a caste census, was also part of the delegation and said the enumeration will be in “interest of the nation” and a step “that will benefit the poor.”“When animals and trees are counted, then why not castes? When the government has no scientific data on the population, how can it make welfare policies?” he said.Yadav also said the perception that a caste-based enumeration will lead to social unrest is flawed. “When states will have the caste data, then only will they be able include castes in their OBC [other backward class] list. If caste census will lead to unrest, then the same logic applies to religion as well.”The demand for a caste census is decades old, especially among OBC groups, but has gathered momentum in recent months, coinciding with the BJP’s outreach among OBCs, a critical votebank in poll-bound states such as Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat. The last full caste census was done in 1931; since Independence, India has only counted scheduled castes and tribes.Sections of the BJP support the demand but the party has not explicitly taken a stand on the issue, given its sensitivity and the possibility of triggering anger among influential upper castes.But the party finds itself cornered by a growing coalition of parties, including allies such as the JD(U), Apna Dal, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Republican Party of India-Athawale. The YSR Congress Party and the Biju Janata Dal, considered friendly parties, have also lent their support to the Opposition’s demand.These parties have argued that a count of castes will give a correct assessment of how castes are numerically poised and which groups have benefitted the most and the least from quotas based on the Mandal commission recommendations that paved the way for 27% reservation for OBCs in government jobs and educational institutions.Among those who spoke in favour of the exercise on Monday were Mukesh Sahani (Vikasheel Insaan Party), former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi (HAM) and Ajit Sharma (Congress). The BJP, which supported two resolutions on the demand passed in the Bihar assembly, was represented by Janak Ram.The demand for caste-based census is a politically sensitive issue for the BJP as its outreach towards the OBCs is seen as attempts at consolidating support from the constituency, perceived to have immense political heft that can sway elections in key states such as Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra.Political commentators credit the BJP‘s big win in the 2014 and 2019 general elections to the massive support it drew from the OBC communities. As per a Lok Niti-CSDS survey the BJP managed 22% of the OBC votes in 2009 Lok Sabha elections as opposed to 42% that was drawn by the regional parties but during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections 44% of the OBCs voted for the BJP while only 27% voted for the regional parties.“Statistics given by the government shows that reservation notwithstanding OBCs make up just 9.42% and 8.95% of all group A and B government jobs,” said a JDU leader.Within the BJP too, there is an apprehension that not agreeing to the count could upset the OBC vote bank. “In Uttar Pradesh where OBCs are estimated to be around 50% of the population, the party is particularly concerned about eliciting the support of the non-dominant OBC castes who make up for more than half of the total OBC population,” said a BJP leader on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-all-party-delegation-meets-modi-pushes-for-caste-based-census-in-india-101629743263657.html

23-08-2021||India||Govt sets Sep 15 deadline for Infosys to fix glitches in I-T portal||NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday conveyed “deep disappointment and concerns” of the government and taxpayers to Salil Parekh, chief executive officer and managing director of Infosys, because of continuing glitches in the e-filing portal of the income tax (I-T) department even after two-and-a-half months of its launch, the finance ministry said.Sitharaman met Parekh in the afternoon and sought an explanation from Infosys for the “repeated issues” faced by taxpayers, it said in a statement. She had summoned him for an explanation on why glitches in the new portal (incometax. gov.in) still persisted months after its launch on June 7.Parekh on Monday assured that Infosys was working expeditiously to ensure a glitch-free experience to the taxpayers on the portal, the statement said after the meeting.Sitharaman demanded that the issues faced by taxpayers on current functionalities of the portal should be resolved by September 15 so that taxpayers and professionals can work seamlessly on the portal, it said.Parekh said “he and his team are doing everything to ensure the smooth functioning of the portal”. He said over 750 team members are working on this project and Pravin Rao, COO of Infosys, is personally overseeing this project. In the meeting, the government emphasised the need for putting in more resources and efforts on the part of Infosys so that the much-delayed delivery of agreed services is ensured. “Parekh was also sensitised on the difficulties that the taxpayers were facing and the problems that are arising on account of the delays in the functioning of the portal,” it said.Infosys did not respond to an email query on this matter.Tax professionals and chartered accountants (CAs) have said the site being completely down is causing immense inconvenience to taxpayers as the deadline for filing ITR is approaching. “There is a rush as the last date for filing personal I-T returns is September 30. The government may have to extend the deadline to salvage the situation,” said Tarun Kumar, a CA.He added that many functions like the filing of rectification applications or the registration of legal heir to file returns on behalf of a deceased hasn’t been enabled yet on the portal.The total number of taxpayers for the assessment year 2019-20 was over 87 million. The total number of ITRs filed, including revised returns, in the financial year 2020-21 was 73.89 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-sets-sep-15-deadline-for-infosys-to-fix-glitches-in-i-t-portal-101629742966886.html
23-08-2021||India||SC pulls up Allahabad, Uttarakhand HCs for staying arrests in murder cases||The Supreme Court on Monday pulled up the high courts of Allahabad and Uttarakhand for “continuously” issuing stay orders on the arrest of people accused of heinous crimes such as murder.“Despite our orders repeatedly holding that no such [stay] order can be passed, the High Courts in Uttar Pradesh (Allahabad) and Uttarakhand are continuously passing such orders,” remarked a bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah.The court’s remarks came while hearing an appeal against a July 23 order passed by the Uttarakhand high court on a plea for quashing the first information report in the murder of a man that named three people as accused. The high court had noted that the prayer for quashing the FIR was “innocuous” and was not pressed for by the accused, but it still allowed them protection from arrest till August 10.The Supreme Court noted that the offence in the case was of murder and the high court should have been more circumspect. “It is a shocking order passed by the high court,” the apex court remarked while noting that the order allowed the accused to surrender by August 10 and also get a decision on their bail plea on the same day, if filed. “Further, it goes on to say that if bail is refused, the papers should be sent to a sessions judge the same day who will deal with the bail expeditiously.”Praveen Salar, the complainant in the case and the brother of the victim, appealed in the Supreme Court against this order. His family, as well as the accused, were business rivals, each owning brick kilns in Haridwar. Salar said he wasn’t even heard before the order was passed. At this, the SC issued a notice to the Uttarakhand government and posted the matter for hearing on September 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-pulls-up-allahabad-uttarakhand-hcs-for-staying-arrests-in-murder-cases-101629742643248.html

The rains led to major accidents such as electrocution, landslides and even house collapses thereby leading to hundreds of fatalities, including in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Rajasthan, among others.According to the latest bulletin by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), more than 10 states are likely to receive widespread rainfall in isolated to scattered places over the next four days till August 27.Also Read | Delhi receives highest one-day rain for August in 13 years: IMDIn its bulletin, the IMD said that the western-end of the monsoon trough lies to the “south of its normal position and the eastern-end lies to the north of its normal position.”The IMD said in its forecast that the western-end will gradually shift northwards from August 24 onwards, and the eastern-end will shift southwards from August 26 onwards.Furthermore, the IMD said that a cyclonic circulation lies over northwest Rajasthan and the neighbourhood in lower tropospheric levels. “Strong southerly/southwesterly winds from Bay of Bengal to northeast India very likely to continue to prevail till August 25,” the IMD bulletin noted.Here are the key IMD alerts for states expected to receive heavy rainfall as an effect of the above-mentioned scenario:1. Widespread rainfall activity with isolated heavy to very heavy falls is very likely to continue over northeast India, sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim till August 27.2. Isolated extremely heavy falls are also expected over Meghalaya and Assam till August 25.3. The IMD bulletin said that fairly widespread to widespread rainfall activity with isolated heavy falls is very likely to continue over Bihar, Uttarakhand and east Uttar Pradesh till August 27.4. According to the bulletin. Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Puducherry’s Mahe are expected to witness scattered to fairly widespread rainfall activity with isolated heavy falls on August 23, 26 and 27.5. Subdued rainfall is very likely over the rest of the country covering northwest India, central India and remaining parts of peninsular India, including Gujarat and Maharashtra (outside Rajasthan) till August 27. In Rajasthan, however, the IMD bulletin stated, dry weather is likely to be present between August 25 and 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/southerly-winds-to-bring-heavy-rainfall-in-these-11-states-till-august-27-imd-101629741824297.html
23-08-2021||India||Bhupesh Baghel, TS Singh Deo to meet Congress brass amid buzz over power sharing||Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and health minister TS Singh Deo are set to meet senior Congress leaders in Delhi on Tuesday even as talk of a reported power-sharing arrangement between the two gains momentum in political circles.Baghel said that senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi will present at the meeting, which will be held in the presence of party’s Chhattisgarh general secretary in-charge PL Punia.“The CM’s meeting was scheduled about one-and-half months ago. It is a review meeting and obviously the power-sharing formula will be discussed. Singh Deo and Baghel both will be present at the meeting,” said a leader close to Baghel who asked not to be named.Tensions between Baghel and Singh Deo have simmered since the formation of the government in December 2018, but have never boiled over. Both leaders have taken the stance that all decisions about the government’s future will be taken by the party high command, and they will follow the instructions from Delhi. However, speculation of a new arrangement has been rising since June 17, the day the CM completed two-and-a-half years of his term.In December 2018, with the Congress winning a comfortable majority after a 15-year Raman Singh-led Bharatiya Janata Party tenure, there were four claimants to the position of chief minister. While senior leader Charan Das Mahant was given the Speaker’s post, a power-sharing agreement was reportedly hammered out between Baghel and Singh Deo at a time when it seemed like Tamradhwaj Sahu, now the state’s home minister, would emerge as the beneficiary of disagreements between the two.On his way to Delhi, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel told reporters at the Raipur airport, “It’s been a long time since I have visited Delhi, and after the pandemic, it is my first trip. We are going to meet with Rahul Gandhi along with our state in charge PL Punia.” Asked if Singhdeo would be joining the meeting, Baghel said, “It’s up to Rahul Gandhi, he can invite anyone. We are going on his invitation.”Singh Deo , when asked about the meeting in Delhi on Tuesday, told HT: “ You should ask Punia ji ( PL Punia); he is correct person to provide more details.”Punia was unavailable for comment despite repeated phone calls.Earlier this month, Singh Deo was in Delhi, where he met senior Congress leaders, although he claimed he was on personal visit.“We know what is going on between Singh Deo and Baghel in Chhattisgarh. I don’t know the sequence and timing of the meetings, but both Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi will meet the Chhattisgarh leaders and all issues including power-sharing will surely be discussed,” said a senior Congress leader in Delhi on condition of anonymity.Over the past two months, there have been several bookmarks of potential tension within the Chhattisgarh government.Last week, Singh Deo wrote a letter to commissioner of the state public relations department seeking action against a news portal that ran a story saying chief minister Baghel will resign on August 17, and attributed the information to Singh Deo.The heath minister demanded “strict action” against the news portal, saying it was a “planned conspiracy” to “pollute” the political environment of state.Then, the issue of power sharing seemed to find tacit admission on August 13 when assembly speaker and senior Congress leader Charan Das Mahant said that four senior leaders – Baghel, Singh Deo, Sahu, and himself – played the semi-finals for the CM post, and the final was in progress. “Semifinals were between four people, and only two remained. But one who wins the finals is eventually the winner. Rahul ji ( Rahul Gandhi) knows all about this formula and only Delhi can give more information about it,” Mahant said.On July 27, Singh Deo walked out of the state assembly where Baghel was present, demanding clarity from his own government over allegations that he was somehow involved in an alleged attack on Congress legislator Brihaspat Singh.The issue began after Singh alleged that his convoy was attacked at the behest of Singh Deo in Surguja district, which is the health minister’s assembly constituency. Later, after the intervention of PL Punia, the issue was resolved, and Singh Deo returned to assembly after Singh apologised for his statements against the minister.Gauri Shankar Srivas, senior BJP spokesperson in Chhattisgarh said, “The infighting within the Congress is causing huge damage to the state. Now, everyone in the state knows about it. The Congress should resolve their issue for the sake of Chhattisgarh.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/baghel-deo-to-meet-cong-brass-amid-buzz-over-power-sharing-101629740426707.html
23-08-2021||India||Jaishankar to brief all-party panel on Afghan situation||External affairs minister S Jaishankar will brief parliamentary floor leaders of various parties on the prevailing Afghanistan situation on Thursday after the Taliban’s takeover of the war-ravaged country fuelled chaos, protests and mass exodus from Kabul.The last all-party meeting on Afghanistan was held 20 years ago, on October 30, 2001, after US forces launched an attack against the Taliban in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror strike. The upcoming meeting, organised by the parliamentary affairs ministry, underlines how history has turned a full circle on Afghan soil.Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi tweeted, “Floor Leaders of Political Parties would be briefed by EAM @DrSJaishankar on the present situation in Afghanistan... Invites are being sent through email. All concerned are requested to attend”, after Jaishankar announced on the micro-blogging site, “In view of developments in Afghanistan, PM @narendramodi has instructed that MEA brief Floor Leaders of political parties.”Both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha leaders of various parties have been invited for the meeting that will see Jaishankar briefing the parties before answering questions.It will be the first parliamentary all-party meeting during the Modi era on an external situation. But the gravity of the Afghanistan situation is hard for parliamentary leaders to overlook as it affects India’s security situation and a deep humanitarian crisis with hundreds of Indian expats as well as Afghan nationals being evacuated.The last all-party meeting was called on the Covid situation on July 20.While all parties are expected to attend the meeting on Afghanistan, some leaders, however, suggested that the government should call a meeting of party chiefs and not just parliamentary leaders. “A meeting on Afghanistan would have been a more fruitful exercise if the party leaders were invited. The government must call a meeting of party leaders,” said Trinamool MP Sudip Bandopadhyay.The previous meeting on Aghanistan was organised by the external affairs ministry but chaired by the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The subject was “American Military Action in Afghanistan”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-to-brief-all-party-panel-on-afghan-situation-101629740126512.html
23-08-2021||India||2 Lashkar commanders killed in gunbattle with police in Kashmir||The Jammu and Kashmir Police on Monday carried out an operation where it killed two top commanders of the The Resistance Force (TRF), an outfit affiliated with the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). The terrorists, Mohd Abbas Sheikh and Saqib Manzoor Dar, were top LeT commanders and were also responsible for carrying out numerous attacks on civilians, lawmakers and security personnel. Sheikh, who is also the chief of the TRF, along with his associate Saqid were killed in the Aloochi Bagh area of Srinagar.The inspector general of Kashmir Zone called the encounter a ‘major’ success. “We had information about their presence in the area. Ten jawans of police dressed in civvies quickly surrounded the area and challenged the terrorists, who opened fire. In the retaliatory firing, the two were killed,” Vijay Kumar said.Earlier this year, Saqib carried out an attack on Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Mohammad Anwar Khan in Srinagar. Though the leader escaped unhurt, one security personnel lost his life. Saqib also killed Abdul Hamid Najar, a BJP worker, in Budgam last year. In a separate onslaught, the militant also attacked owners of commercial establishments and looted ₹35,000 from the branch of the Grameen Bank in Srinagar. Saqib was involved in at least 10 incidents between 2020 and 2021 where he attacked security personnel, leading to the death of at least seven security personnel.He was also behind the death of advocate Babar Qadri.Mohd Abbas Sheikh was responsible for the deaths of police and security personnel and also was an accomplice of Saqib. Sheikh also killed an owner of a mobile shop and along with Saqib killed police officer Pervaiz Ahmad Dar. He was earlier a member of terrorist organisation Hizbul Mujahideen but defected to the TRF two years ago. The locals were also concerned as these terrorists were also actively recruiting youth to their ranks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-lashkar-commanders-killed-in-gunbattle-with-police-in-kashmir-101629739096391.html

Germany has been operating military evacuation flights that have flown out nearly 2,700 people from Kabul airport.Spoke to Chancellor Merkel this evening and discussed bilateral, multilateral and regional issues, including recent developments in Afghanistan. Reiterated our commitment to strengthening the India-Germany Strategic Partnership.German troops are among international forces securing the Kabul airport and some of them were involved in a gun battle on Monday.On Sunday, German foreign minister Heiko Maas spoke with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar as part of Berlin’s efforts to cooperate with international and regional partners on the evacuation flights. “Need to continue evacuation efforts for as long as possible,” the German foreign ministry tweeted.Modi and Merkel also discussed issues on the bilateral agenda, including collaboration on Covid-19 vaccines, development cooperation focused on climate and energy, and fostering trade and economic relations.They exchanged views on issues of multilateral interest such as the forthcoming COP26 meeting and the Indian initiative to promote a dialogue on maritime security at the United Nations Security Council. India holds the rotating presidency of the Security Council for August.“They emphasised commonality of perspectives between both sides on promoting inclusive cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region,” the readout said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/repatriation-of-stranded-most-urgent-priority-in-afghanistan-say-modi-merkel-101629737846259.html
23-08-2021||India||Amid crisis, India hopes to evacuate another 150 people, including nationals||India is expected to evacuate up to 150 people, including its own nationals and dozens of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus, from Kabul to Dushanbe in military aircraft on Monday before flying them home on commercial flights.A group of almost 50 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus entered Kabul airport by Monday afternoon, hours after an Afghan soldier was killed and three more were injured in a gun battle near the military side of the facility. The firefight began when a sniper outside the airport fired at former Afghan soldiers helping US forces as guards.The Indian side is hopeful of pulling out almost all of the Indian nationals who have registered for evacuation flights by Monday, along with Afghan Sikhs and Hindus and other Afghan citizens, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.C-130 aircraft of the Indian Air Force (IAF) will fly the people to the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe, from where they will be brought home in Air India flights.On Sunday, India evacuated nearly 540 people, including 475 of its nationals, on several flights from Kabul, Dushanbe and Doha. Nearly 200 people – including diplomats, officials and security personnel posted at the Indian embassy and some Indian nationals – were flown out of Kabul within two days of the Taliban marching into the Afghan capital.The people cited above said Dushanbe had emerged as an important hub for the evacuation flights for a variety of reasons, including logistics and support infrastructure.“Time slots and space at Kabul airport continue to be limited. It is easier to station our aircraft in Tajikistan and fly the evacuees from Kabul to Dushanbe whenever we have gathered enough people at the airport. The flight takes about 45 minutes,” one of the people said.“It is also easier to process all the paperwork and complete all the formalities for the evacuees in Dushanbe, where we have back up from the Indian embassy. Plus, we have access to the airbase at Ayni near Dushanbe,” the person said.“Besides, the evacuees get some time to rest and recover after the harrowing journey into Kabul airport, which remains the most difficult part of the evacuation process,” the person added.Since 2002, India has renovated the Ayni airbase, located 10 km west of Dushanbe, at a cost of more than $70 million under an agreement with Tajikistan. The upgrades included extending the runway to 3,200 metres and installing navigation and defensive equipment.The tactic of flying the evacuees from Kabul to Dushanbe and then sending them back home in commercial flights has proved to be less time-consuming, the people said. The Air India aircraft can fly directly from Dushanbe to New Delhi via Pakistani airspace, unlike military aircraft which have to take a longer route through Iranian airspace and over the Arabian Sea.Some of the airlifts using the IAF’s C-17 Globemaster heavy lift aircraft had involved the more circuitous route and more stops for refuelling, the people pointed out.The security situation at Kabul airport, which is controlled by the US military, continues to be precarious. At least 20 people have died in the chaos at the airport, mostly in shootings and stampedes, as US and international forces try to evacuate citizens and Afghans facing threats from the Taliban.The Taliban have deployed hundreds of their fighters outside the airport to enforce some sort of order. On Saturday, seven Afghans were killed in a crush at the gates.The gun battle near the north gate of the Kabul airport on Monday, which also involved US and German troops, highlighted the fragile security situation in the area.President Joe Biden said on Sunday the US could extend the August 31 deadline for the withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan in order to fly out thousands of US citizens and Afghans, but Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen described the development as a “red line” and warned that there “would be consequences” if the US or the UK were to seek additional time for evacuations.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to urge Biden this week to extend the evacuation deadline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-crisis-india-hopes-to-evacuate-another-150-people-including-nationals-101629735986105.html

He is still very healthy, said an official of West Bengal’s forest department that celebrated the event by holding online drawing and quiz competitions on tigers and wildlife protection. A video on life of the tiger in the enclosure was also released.The tiger, Raja, is considered among the oldest in India. Bengal tigers have an average life span of 12-15 years in the wild and 20 years or more in captivity, according to the Wildlife Institute of India (2018) National Studbook of Bengal.Gum-line recession, a physiological aspect of ageing, is said to be reliable way to estimate age of adults tiger. Raja’s age has been estimated using this method, officials said.Deepak M, divisional forest officer of Jaldapara National Park, said, “The day Raja was brought to us was marked as his birthday. He was 12 years old then and could not walk.” “In 2008, Raja was crossing a river at the Sajnekhali Wildlife Sanctuary in the Sunderbans when a crocodile attacked him. His left hind leg was badly injured in the fight. He was taken to the Alipore Zoo in Kolkata and brought to Alipurduar after preliminary treatment,” said Deepak M. Veterinary doctor Pralay Mandal, four doctors in his team, and wildlife guard Partha Sarathi Sinha treated the injured tiger. Though the other injuries healed, Raja could walk only after nine months. When Raja arrived at the rehabilitation centre there were already 19 Bengal tigers that had been rescued from circuses. Some of them died of age while the rest were sent to zoos. Raja is the only Bengal tiger left now. There are 21 leopards as well. Sinha, who still serves as forest guard, said, “Raja is still very healthy and this makes us proud. No Bengal tiger has lived for 25 years. We are witness to history.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-tiger-maimed-by-crocodile-13-yrs-ago-turns-25-at-south-khairbari-rehab-101629735927725.html

23-08-2021||India||5 women officers pick up rank of colonel in new branches||The Indian Army on Monday announced that a board has cleared the promotion of five women officers to the time-scale rank of Colonel after the completion of the mandatory 26 years of service. This is the first time that women officers have been promoted to the rank outside the medical, legal and education wings of the army.The promotion forms part of natural career progression after the army began granting them permanent commission after a ruling by the Supreme Court last year.The widening of promotion avenues to more branches of the Indian Army is a sign of increasing career opportunities for women officers, the army said in a statement. “Combined with the decision to grant permanent commission to women officers from a majority of branches of the Indian Army, this step defines the Indian Army’s approach towards a gender-neutral army,” the statement said.The development comes 18 months after the top court ruled that women officers, who joined the Indian Army through short service commission (SSC), were entitled to permanent commission and command roles.The five women officers approved for the rank of colonel are serving with the Corps of Signals, Corps of Electronics and Mechanical Engineers (EME) and the Corps of Engineers. They are Lieutenant Colonels Sangeeta Sardana from the Corps of Signals, Sonia Anand and Navneet Duggal from the Corps of EME and Reenu Khanna and Ritcha Sagar from the Corps of Engineers.“The potential of lady officers was unseen and not utilised well so far. With permanent commission being approved, women are now picking up the rank of colonel. It shows they are no less than their male counterparts. Kudos to their strength and perseverance…It’s been a long wait but worth it,” said Captain Shalini Singh (retd), a former SSC officer whose husband, Major Avinash Singh Bhadauria, was posthumously awarded the Kirti Chakra in 2001.The headcount of women in the military has increased almost three-fold over the last six years, with more avenues being opened to them at a steady pace. As of February 2021, there were 9,118 women serving in the army, navy and air force.Last week, the Supreme Court directed the government to allow women to take the next entrance exam for the National Defence Academy (NDA), thus far a male preserve, opening the doors of the premier training institution to women. Women were allowed to serve in select branches of the three services as SSC officers almost three decades ago.One of the turning points for women in the military came in 2015 when the Indian Air Force decided to induct them into the fighter stream. Earlier this year, the Indian Navy deployed four women officers on warships after a hiatus of almost 25 years.In May 2021, the army inducted the first batch of women into the Corps of Military Police, the first time that women joined the military in the non-officer cadre. In June 2021, two women army officers were for the first time selected to train as helicopter pilots at the force’s premier Combat Army Aviation Training School at Nashik in Maharashtra. But tanks and combat positions in the infantry are still no-go zones for women....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-women-officers-pick-up-rank-of-colonel-in-new-branches-101629733228960.html
23-08-2021||India||‘Covid-19 third wave is completely avoidable if…’: What this govt expert says||Following the debilitating effect of the second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on India, concerns are growing regarding the third wave of the virus. Speaking on the issue, the secretary of the government’s department of biotechnology, Dr Renu Swarup, said on Monday that the third wave will come “if invited” either by human behaviour or that of the virus.The behaviour of the virus, Swaroop said, is known and it is typical of mutation and that “we don’t have control over that.”“Human behaviour is in our control, which involves adopting Covid-appropriate behaviour vis-à-vis maintaining hygiene, wearing a face mask, following social distancing,” she told news agency ANI.As the Delta strain remains a matter of concern across the globe with more than 100 nations bearing the brunt of it, and even in India where several states have extended the Covid-19-induced restrictions over the fear of a third wave, Swaroop says that following norms will help in breaking the chain of transmission.“If we continue to follow Covid-19 protocol and break the chain of transmission, we will not allow the virus to go from one host to the other,” she told ANI.Several reports have surfaced over the past few months regarding the onset of the third wave of Covid-19. The National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM), under the ministry of home affairs, has cautioned in its report to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) that the wave will reach its peak in October. The report, furthermore, quoted a Reuters opinion survey of 40 experts who predicted the third wave to arrive between July 15 and October 13.According to ANI, Swaroop, however, stressed on her point that there is “no way” the wave is going to happen if people “allow it to be controlled.”Also Read | Covid third wave likely this month, may peak in October: ReportIndia on Monday recorded 25,072 fresh coronavirus cases, the lowest in the past 160 days, thereby taking the cumulative tally of the country to 32,449,306, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare.

There are no documents available with them (drivers). That’s why the vehicles were seized,” said Karnataka transport commissioner N Shiva Kumar.According to the motor vehicle law, vehicle owners are required to obtain a new registration certificate and pay the state’s road tax if a vehicle registered in another state is kept in the state for more than 12 months. The owner can apply for a refund of the road tax from the state where it was originally registered.“Some of these cars bore registration numbers belonging to Maharashtra or Pondicherry. These cars have not paid road tax in Karnataka… (which results in) a big loss to the state exchequer,” he added.The special checking was conducted near UB city mall, a popular shopping destination in Bengaluru.Apart from the Rolls Royce, officials said the other cars seized on Sunday include an Audi, Range Rover, Porsche, Mercedes Benz, and Jaguar. The vehicles have been kept at the Road Transport Office (RTO) in Nelamangala on the outskirts of Karnataka’s capital city Bengaluru.Of the seven, only one car owner has come forward with the documents so far and the documents presented are being verified.Karnataka’s additional transport commissioner (enforcement) Narendra Holkar said the person driving the Rolls Royce could not produce the relevant documents but only had a letter purportedly signed by Amitabh Bachchan stating that the vehicle was sold to himVahan (the Government of India database) does not reflect any details about the vehicle. “So, we have seized the vehicle to examine the claims made by the driver, said Holkar.On Monday, a person who identified himself as a realtor, Babu, said he purchased the car from the superstar in 2019 for ₹6 crore.“The family uses the car on Sundays and when they came out (on Sunday), the department seized the vehicle. In my case, the driver couldn’t produce the original documents. The documents are at home, and I have told them that I will bring them to the RTO,” said Babu. Babu said the vehicle ownership documents were not transferred from the actor to his name when he bought the car.Officials said the vehicle owners may have to pay heavy penalties if they cannot produce the required documentation.“The due process will be followed. In case anyone is found violating rules fines will impose and if they can’t produce any documents, there is an option of auctioning these vehicles. We have done such auctions in the past,” said a senior department official.Luxury cars had last come under the scanner of the Karnataka Police’s Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in Mangaluru in March this year when it probed a case of alleged middlemen selling luxury cars in violation of legal processes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rolls-royce-once-owned-by-amitabh-bachchan-among-7-cars-seized-in-karnataka-101629730525573.html
23-08-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: August 24, 1951 — Korean truce talks suspended; UN accused of bombing Kaesong||Tokyo- U.N command H.Q. announced today the Communists had broken off the six-week-old Korea truce talks “from now on “-but a later Peking Radio broadcast merely said they were “suspended “ for today. The broadcast seemed to confirm the growing impression here that the breach was not irrevocable. The unexpected breach was made by a Communist liaison officer, who had summoned U.N. liaison officers to investigate the evidence that a U.N. plarie had napalmed and strafed the Kaesong neutral zone at 11 o’clock last night. The U.N. officers reported: “The whole incident is a frame-up from first to last,” according to Vice. Adm. Joy, chief U.N. delegate. Later Gen. Ridgway himself issued a special release repeating that a thorough investigation had failed to reveal that any attack had been carried out by U.N. aircraft. An official translation of the Chinese version of the Peking Radio broadcast of the breach-earlier translations had caused confusion about whether it was permanent or temporary-quoted the Communist liaison officer as saying: “I first lodge and also notify you that all meetings for August 23 are suspended. Our side reserves the right, to make all the necessary demands and are still in process of investigation.” It accused the U.S. investigating others of showing “an irksome and irresponsible attitude “ towards the I alleged incident.Another translation said the Americans appeared “disgusted and indifferent.” U.N. ANNOUNCEMENTThe official U.N. announcement said: “Further meetings of both the armistice delegations and the sub-committee were declared of from now on at approximately 2 a.m., August 23, by the Communists on the basis of the charge of bombing of the Kaesong area by U.N. forces. “Col. Chang, Communist liaison officer, speaking from written notes, obviously prepared well in advance made the statement to Col. A. J. Kinney and Col. J. T. Murray, junior U.N. liaison others, who had come to Kaesong at midnight at the request of the Communists to investigate the charges. “ Col. Kinney’s report based on investigation on the spot but in darkness suggests that the whole incident is a frame-up from first to last.”“Col. Chang insisted that a U.N. Command aircraft had attacked Kaesong neutral zone at 11-20 p.m. on August 22, including strikes within the immediate conference , area,” it added.Lt.-Col. Tsai then produced two small bits of metal which, he alleged, had hit the jeep of a senior Communist delegate. Col. Chang could not say whether one or more aircraft were involved. He stated he did not know how many bombs were dropped or how many passes the aircraft blew up. NO BOMB CRATER “ Col. Kinney and Col. Murray were then escorted to within 100 yards of the U.N. Command delegation house and there were shown a rumpled piece of rolled metal about 18 to 30 inches in size covered with oil and lying on the road. Col. Chang asserted this was a napalm bomb. There was no bomb crater near and no scorched earth, but about 25 yards away there was a minor depression in the earth about 24 inches in diameter and perhaps six inches deep. “Col. Murray judges the depression as the possible result of a buried explosive of force about equal to a hand-grenade. Col. Kinney is certain it is not a bomb crater.Near the Communist house other pieces of metal were pointed out, the report added. Two of these appeared to be pieces of a U.N. Command aircraft. Flush riveting, was noted on each piece, both of which about 12 inches square. The third piece was the pin of a rocket. Vice-Adm. Joy reported his liaison officers concluded from the investigation that the scattered evidence may have been planted by having Communist aircraft fly over Kaesong dropping small cans of napalm, or else entirely manufactured on the ground. Returning to the conference house, Col. Kinney stated the evidence plainly was not the result of U.N. bombing, the report added. He pointed out there was no damage evident to any structure, person or i even to crops. SOLDIER QUESTIONED “In the course of the discussion, Col. Kinney asked if anyone present had actually seen an aircraft. A Communist soldier was put forward who declared he had seen an aircraft at 11 p.m. “Col. Kinney asked if this aircraft had shown light and the soldier answered: ‘ Yes, the head- lights were on. “ At this point a European Communist intervened, charging Col. Kinney with tricking the soldier with a trap question. Col Kinney immediately requested Col. Chang to clear the area of news reporters at once. Col Chang complied after some argument.” The report said the U.N. officers asked the Communist to preserve the evidence and renew the investigation by daylight. But he refused, saying the investigation had ended and he had to remove the evidence for analysis. Gen. Ridgway’s announcement said neither Air Force nor Navy planes were over the Kaesong area. The only U.N. guns which could reach the area had not fired a shot for 24 hours. He said flush riveting was not used by the U.N. to manufacture napalm tanks. “They are of rough construction, more economically produced since they are used only once.” Gen. Ridgway referred to the alleged eye-witness of the attack who told liaison officers the aircraft had used headlights-and declared that U.N. planes did not use lights during night operations. PRE-PLANNED MOVEHe also stated the decision to declare all meetings “ off from this time “ was a high level one which could “ not have been arrived at and transmitted to Col. Chang, in the interval between 11.20 p.m. of August 22 and 1.45 a.m. of August 23.” Just before the break-off meeting, Adm. Joy had emphatically rejected three other Communist allegations that the U.N. had violated the Kaesong neutral zone.On the war fronts the Eighth Army reported decreasing Communist resistance in the Yanggu sector. South Korean troops were attacking and had made limited gains. The east front offensive was moving again after being blocked on Tuesday by heavy Communist counter-attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-august-24-1951-korean-truce-talks-suspended-un-accused-of-bombing-kaesong-ridgway-denies-allegation-101629728186103.html

The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), which manages the temple, has teamed up with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to develop biodegradable bags which will be used to sell the mahaprasadam laddu, officials said. A dedicated sale counter has been set up by the TTD near the laddu counters adjacent to the Tirumala temple where the devotees can first buy these bags before heading to counters to buy the prasadam.Detailing about the initiative, DRDO chairman Satish Reddy said, “Our Advance Systems Laboratory in Hyderabad has been doing a lot of research and inventing ways to find the best environmental friendly replacement for hazardous plastic. To minimise single-use plastic, we have come out with these eco-friendly bags made of starch corn which degrades naturally within 90 days. It is also not harmful even if cattle consume them. After detailed research and rigorous testing of the formula, we have come out with these bags for Tirumala.”It is a significant move by the TTD to shift to biodegradable bags. The body was one of the biggest distributors of single-use plastic covers before 2019. In the period between 2014 and 2018, TTD procured and distributed 9.63 crore polythene laddu covers to the devotees.The new TTD board under the chairmanship of YV Subba Reddy realised that the trust would be causing severe damage to the environment if it continued to promote the use of polythene laddu covers. A blanket ban on the use of single-use plastic covers was imposed in 2019 post which a tie-up was announced with the DRDO.Talking about the harmful effects of polythene bags, Satish Reddy, said, “Usually conventional polyethene bags made from petrochemicals are toxic to the environment and take nearly 200 years to degrade. In contrast, these bags would be offered as a sustainable, cost-effective and ocean-safe alternative to such plastic products.” “Products like these are essential for the survival of mankind. After observing the response from the pilgrims for a few days, we are planning to commence its sales in a full-fledged manner,” noted TTD EO Dr KS Jawahar Reddy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-develops-biodegradable-bags-for-sale-of-tirumala-laddus-101629723684933.html

Separately, 87 Indian citizens and two Nepalese nationals were back to Delhi from Tajikistan’s capital Dushanbe in a special Air India flight, news agency PTI reported.Furthermore, as many as 135 Indians, who were flown out of Kabul to Doha a few days ago on United States and NATO-operated aircraft, were also repatriated to Delhi on Sunday.Among the 168 passengers that the IAF aircraft brought back were Afghan lawmakers Narendra Singh Khalsa and Anarkali Honaryar and their families.An evacuee from Afghanistan, who identified themselves as T Sarkar, and was among the 146 passengers who landed in Delhi on Monday, said that a few days before August 14 – the day before the Taliban took over Kabul -- the Indian Embassy told them to “stay prepared to leave Afghanistan at any time.”“There is an atmosphere of fear in Kabul. On August 14, we were evacuated to Qatar from Kabul,” Sarkar was quoted as saying by ANI.Another evacuee, Sunil, said that an US Embassy flight flew them to Qatar from Kabul, following which the Indian Embassy flight went there to bring them back home.The US troops are currently in control of the Kabul airport, while the Taliban have captured the checkpoints leading up to the venue. Over the last few days, several reports have emerged regarding people dying in and around the airport as Afghans make frantic attempts to leave their homeland. In a statement, the British defence ministry said that at least seven Afghan nationals lost their lives in the crowds as tens of thousands tried to leave the country.However, the Taliban put the blame for the evacuation mayhem at the airport on the US troops and claimed that there is “peace and calm” everywhere else in Afghanistan – despite reports of violence already emerging from various regions.Also Read | Taliban blame US for Kabul airport chaos as Afghans race to fleeMeanwhile, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will be convening a G7 meeting on Tuesday to discuss the ongoing Afghanistan situation.

23-08-2021||India||Rain revival pushes up kharif sowing to normal levels: Data||Planting of summer-sown kharif crops, which account for half of India’s annual food output, accelerated in August as the monsoon revived, but acreage under key crops are still down 1% over last year due to erratic rainfall, as experts said extreme weather this year could trim yields.The June-September rain-bearing system, which waters nearly 60% of the country’s net-sown area, has been forecast to be normal by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Current official figures of the area under various crops more or less offer a full picture of the sowing season, marked by short spurts of heavy rainfall and a long pause from the middle of June to middle of July, a hiatus though to be linked to climate change.A revival of rainfall pulled up sowing levels significantly of crops such as paddy, soyabean, pulses, oilseeds, millets and horticulture, but farmers have been unable to match the record levels of sowing in 2020. Nearly half of all Indians depend on a farm-based income.Also Read | Govt’s palm oil push based on disputed reportThe national weather agency officially forecast a normal monsoon during 2021, which helps farmers grow plentiful crops. A good harvest drives up rural demand for goods and services, helping the economy grow.Overall, farmers have been able to plant 104 million hectares than the normal area of 101 million hectares as on August 20, higher by 3.2%. However, this is about 1% less than the total area of 104 million hectares sown in 2020. An average of the past five years’ acreage is considered normal, according to the agriculture ministry’s classification.Heavy rains disrupted sowing of cotton, a key commercial crop, and acreage stands at nearly 11.7 million hectares, nearly 7% less than the 12.7 million hectare of last year. A reviving monsoon drove sowing of soyabean, a key oilseed that widely consumed as edible oil, to about 18 million hectares, roughly what is considered normal.Planting of coarse cereals too picked to 16 million hectares, while total pulses stood at 13.4 million hectares, both considered normal.The monsoon is one of the factors that influences the Reserve Bank’s inflation forecast and monetary policy, which determines key interest rates.July is agriculturally the most critical month during the kharif season, since rains during this month determine yields and crop health. Economists are looking to a robust farm growth to cushion the impacts of the pandemic on the overall economy.Rains were fairly poor in many parts in the initial weeks of July. More than the deficiency, this year’s uneven rains have been a cause of concern, agriculturally and climate-wise.“I more or less expected sowing to catch up to stand at normal levels,” said KJ Ramesh, a climatologist and former chief of the IMD.Longer monsoon pauses followed by heavy spells of rainfall are telltale signs of climate change, experts say. “The consensus is that the number of rainy days will decrease because of climate change but overall quantum of rainfall will remain same. So, there will be segments or periods of very heavy rain,” he added.In 2020-21, when India faced a recession due to the pandemic, agriculture was the only sector to post positive growth of about 3.1%. This helped to keep farm incomes steady.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rain-revival-pushes-up-kharif-sowing-to-normal-levels-data-101629719904902.html

It has alleged that the accused persons were active members of the banned terror outfit CPI (Maoist). The arrested accused in the case include activists and academicians Sudha Bharadwaj, Vernon Gonsalves, Varavara Rao, Hany Babu, Anand Teltumbde, Shoma Sen, Gautam Navlakha and others. Elderly tribal rights activist and an accused in the case, Stan Swamy passed away in custody on July 5 this year after suffering a cardiac arrest.The Elgar Parishad case is related to inflammatory speeches made at a conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which, the police claimed, triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial located on the outskirts of the western Maharashtra city. The prosecution claimed the conclave was organised by people with alleged Maoist links.Also read | Hany Babu to be shifted back to Navi Mumbai jail, says HCThe NIA said the main objective of the accused was to establish a "Janata Sarkar (people's government) through revolution and armed struggle to seize power from the State". The draft also claimed that the accused attempted to "wage war against the Governments of India and Maharashtra".Framing of charges is the first step before trial commences in the case where the prosecution describes the charges against the accused along with the evidence to be relied upon. After the framing of charges, the court will ask the accused whether they plead guilty or not in the case. The draft further claimed the accused had been playing provocative songs, enacting short plays and skits in Pune during the Elgar Parishad meeting and distributing Naxal literature."That the criminal conspiracy was an intention to bring about secession of a part of territory of India and incite individuals to bring about such a secession," it said.

23-08-2021||India||Rift widens? Chhattisgarh CM, health minister to meet Rahul Gandhi in Delhi||Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and health minister TS Singh Deo will come to New Delhi on Tuesday as differences within the state unit of the ruling Congress is likely to have intensified.The two senior leaders are scheduled to meet former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and the party’s state in-charge PL Punia, according to news agency ANI . There have been reports about tensions between Baghel and Deo, who was among the chief ministerial candidates when the Congress returned to power in the state in 2018. Baghel completed two and half years at the helm on June 17. Deo is believed to have reminded Baghel about the power-sharing formula apparently agreed upon in 2018 when another minister, Tamradhwaj Sahu, was also among the contenders for the top post.While both Deo and Baghel have maintained the central leadership would take a final decision on the matter, the duo has been making frequent trips to Delhi to plead for their case.Last week, Deo had sought action against a news portal that had cited him as the source for an article claiming Baghel would resign on August 17. The public relations department asked the portal to issue a corrigendum or else face legal action. Deo called the story carried on August 15 a “planned conspiracy” to “pollute” the state’s political environment. Baghel is in charge of the department.The rift within the ruling party had come to the fore when Deo walked out of the Assembly demanding clarity from his own government over allegations that one of his relatives was involved in an alleged attack on Congress legislator Brihaspat Singh.Deo was unsatisfied with the government’s statement over the alleged road rage incident involving Singh’s convoy on July 24.At present, Chhattisgarh is one of the last remaining states where the grand old party is in power.

India has been registering a high number of breakthrough infections, the Indian SARS-CoV2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) said last week, adding vaccination has shown to be effective against severe infection, hospitalisation, and even death.A genomic sequencing of breakthrough infections has found the highly transmissible Delta variant as the cause."As of now, sequencing of vaccination breakthroughs in India is also showing a very high proportion of the Delta variant. Investigations for any new variants are ongoing," INSACOG said, adding that of the 30,230 samples of ‘Variants of Concern and Variants of Interest’ sequenced by the INSACOG, 20,324 were of Delta.Worldover, breakthrough cases of infection have been driven by the Delta and Delta plus variants. In India, Kerala has reported a large number of such cases. According to experts, breakthrough cases of any virus are expected to a certain extent, since even in clinical trials, no vaccine is 100 per cent effective.Cases of breakthrough infection have been soaring in the US since May and that has caused many states to bring back mask mandates and start talks on booster shots since the effectiveness of vaccines diminishes over time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-alpha-variants-behind-breakthrough-covid-cases-in-india-no-new-strain-101629716100326.html

The defence ministry said that a selection board of the Indian Army cleared the way for the promotion of five women officers to Colonel (time scale) rank.These officers have completed 26 years of "reckonable service", the ministry said in a release.The five women officers selected for Colonel time ccale rank are Lt Col Sangeeta Sardana from the Corps of Signals, Lt Col Sonia Anand and Lt Col Navneet Duggal from the Corps of EME and Lt Col Reenu Khanna and Lt Col Ritcha Sagar from the Corps of Engineers.This is the first time that women officers serving with the Corps of Signals, Corps of Electronic and Mechanical Engineers (EME) and the Corps of Engineers have been approved to the rank of Colonel.Previously, promotion to the rank of Colonel was only applicable for women officers in the Army Medical Corps (AMC), Judge Advocate General (JAG) and the Army Education Corps (AEC)."The widening of promotion avenues to more branches of the Indian Army is a sign of increasing career opportunities for women officers," the defence ministry said."Combined with the decision to grant permanent commission to women officers from a majority of branches of the Indian Army, this step defines the Indian Army’s approach towards a gender-neutral Army," it added.This comes days five after the Supreme Court allowed eligible women to take the examination for admission to National Defence Academy (NDA). The top court, however, said that the result of the examination would be subject to final adjudication of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-army-grants-time-scale-colonel-rank-to-5-women-officers-101629713988127.html

Kundan Shinde, who was Deshmukh's assistant, and his personal secretary Sanjeev Paland have been chargesheeted in the case, according to the news agency. Both were arrested by the federal agency on June 26 for their alleged role in the laundering of money on Deshmukh’s directions.The ED registered a case against Deshmukh after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed an FIR against him on April 21 following the allegations that the former Shiv Sena leader directed a police officer to extort ₹100 crore a month from Mumbai’s hotels and bars. The allegations were levelled by former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh.Deshmukh has denied all allegations against him multiple times.The ED has claimed that its probe suggests that Deshmukh misused his position as Maharashtra home minister, and through assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze collected ₹4.7 crore from Mumbai’s bars for their “smooth functioning”.

23-08-2021||India||After gap of 4 months, Jagannath temple in Puri reopens for all devotees||The famous Jagannath temple in Puri reopened after four months on Mondayfor people outside of the pilgrim town if they were carrying a negative RT-PCR report or Covid-19 vaccination certificate.The 12th century temple in Odisha’s Puri was closed from April 24 after Covid cases in the second wave of the infection started rising in the state, also resulting in the famous Rath Yatra in June being held without the presence of devotees for the second year in a row.“The darshan timing in the temple has been fixed from 7 am to 8 pm on 5 days a week except for Saturdays and Sundays. This apart, entry of the public into the temple will also remain restricted on the occasion of Janmashtami. We expect around 15,000-20,000 footfalls every day,” said Dr Krishan Kumar, chief administrator of the Jagannatha Temple.He said devotees will be allowed entry into the temple only if they are carrying a certificate showing they are fully-vaccinated or a negative RT-PCR test report, not older than 96 hours. Devotees will also be required to bring their photo ID such as Aadhaar or voter card.A devotee from Bargarh district said she was too elated following the darshan [viewing the divine] of the trinity at the temple. “I had never imagined that I would [finally] get to see the Lord and was waiting for the opportunity,” she said.All devotees are allowed entry through the Singhadwar and to exit through the Uttaradwar of the temple. Barricades have been installed to make sure devotees maintain physical distancing and as many as eight kiosks have been set up to facilitate proper sanitisation.Temple officials said devotees cannot touch statues or idols inside the premises and have been asked not to take offerings like flowers/ bhoga/ diyas inside the Temple. There will be big containers placed at the entrance, where such items can be dropped, if being carried by the devotees.Chewing of Tobacco, Paan and spitting inside the temple premises has been strictly prohibited and a fine of ₹500/- will be levied for each violation.Puri police chief Kanwar Vishal Singh said around 12 platoons of police force have been deployed in and outside the temple. Singh said devotees have been urged to submit their feedback on police service at the temple either by submitting a form or through online QR code scanning systems installed at parking lots and other places.The temple is being reopened at a time when Covid cases are on a decline in the state. On Monday, Odisha reported 761 new cases in the preceding 24 hours with a Test Positivity Rate (TPR) of 1.25%. Out of the 761 cases, 101 are children below 18 years of age. Khurda district recorded 289 fresh infections- the highest in the state, followed by Cuttack (117) and Balasore (52).Apart from the Jagannath temple, other shrines in the state including Ram mandir in Bhubaneswar, Akhandalamani temple in Bhadrak as well as mosques and churches are being allowed to reopen.

23-08-2021||India||Indian evacuation from Kabul on verge of completion, 2 more flights today||With Modi’s government’s mission Kabul entering its end phase with two more evacuation flights landing from Afghanistan today, the Ministry of External Affairs and National Security set-up have achieved what looked to be impossible on August 15, the day the Taliban captured Kabul. Two more evacuation flights are expected to land from Kabul on Monday with the total number of Indians evacuated from Afghanistan in the excess of 700. Already, six flights, a mixture of Indian Air Force and Air India, have completed their missions with the evacuation starting on August 16.According to diplomats based in Delhi and Kabul, the evacuation of Indians from Kabul involved multi-pronged diplomatic and security manoeuvres with Indian interlocutors led by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and the national security planners talking to top officials in Washington, Doha, Dushanbe, Tashkent, Ankara and of course Kabul at the same time.Even after the US cut out a deal with the Taliban on exiting Afghanistan, the evacuation process is a complex exercise given the multiple levels of security screenings each evacuee has to pass under the barrel of M-4 carrying trigger-happy Islamist fighters of the Taliban and sundry groups. While the Hamid Karzai international airport operations are being handled by the US Rangers, the first perimeter protection is with Turkish Forces and the second perimeter protection with Taliban, who have multiple blockades and check-posts throughout the Capital en route to Kabul. Even after the buses carrying evacuees manages to reach the airport, the Turkish forces open fire on the Afghan refugees thronging the airport. Since the refugees have little respect for any firing in the air, there have been instances of direct firing to make way for the evacuation process as a result of which many people have been killed. After the Taliban have searched the evacuees and Turkish have let through the vehicle, the US forces do full screening before the passengers are allowed to board the flight.Also read | Panjshir, Afghanistan's valley of resistance, remains a challenge for TalibanLast week before the first Indian evacuation flight took off, EAM Jaishankar was in New York and in constant touch with the Americans, Turks, Qatar and Indian allies in Central Asia to let the flight through. From Delhi, the National security team was also working its way through their US counterparts and through sources in the Taliban leadership to get the flights out. But this was not all.Also watch | Does Joe Biden trust the Taliban? Watch US President’s reply to reporterThe Indian aircraft were not allowed to be parked at Kabul for security reasons as a result of which the Indian Air Force and Air India planes were parked at Dushanbe and Tashkent airports and waiting to go. The situation was made more complex as the IAF planes are not allowed to fly over Pakistani airspace and had to fly over Iran with the special permission of Tehran. This not only resulted in extra flying hours but also IAF landings to be made at Jamnagar and then to Delhi. The Air India pilots also contributed to the evacuation effort as insurance companies voiced concerns over the safety of Kabul airport. Also read | 1 Afghan security force member killed, 3 hurt in firefight at Kabul airportIn spite of all these serious safety concerns in Kabul, a MEA and a security team worked in shepherding all the Indian nationals to the Hamid Karzai airport in time and safely. There were instances when the Taliban searched the Indian evacuees for documents and material as no baggage is allowed. The Indian nightmare in Kabul is now nearly over but dark days for Afghanistan have just begun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-evacuation-from-kabul-on-verge-of-completion-2-more-flights-today-101629700983541.html
23-08-2021||India||Sidhu summons advisors as row erupts over their comments on Kashmir, Pak||Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Monday summoned both his newly appointed advisors, Malwinder Singh Mali and Pyare Lal Garg, to his Patiala residence following a controversy over their recent comments on sensitive issues like Pakistan and Kashmir and a controversial sketch of late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi posted by one of them on social media.Besides leaving the Congress leadership red-faced, the comments and posts made on social media platforms have provided adequate ammunition to leaders of Opposition parties like the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) to hit out at the ruling camp in Punjab. Punjab is slated to see the next Assembly election early next year.In a recent social media post, Mali had waded into the issue of revocation of Article 370 of the Constitution, which gave a special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. Garg had recently questioned chief minister Amarinder Singh’s criticism of Pakistan stating it was was not in the interest of the state.Mali had also posted a sketch of the late PM wherein she is seen standing near a heap of human skulls, holding a gun with a skull hanging on its muzzle.Also read | Amarinder, Sidhu form 'strategic group' for coordination between party and govtAmong Congress leaders who have reacted sharply to the controversy are Singh and Lok Sabha MP Manish Tiwari. The chief minister, who has been at loggerheads for long with Sidhu, has warned the duo against making “atrocious and ill-conceived” comments that were potentially dangerous to the peace and stability of the state and the country. He also called the statements “anti-national”.Tiwari, who represents Anandpur Sahib in the Lok Sabha, wondered if such people have any right to live in the country. "Do such people even have the right to live in the country, forget about being in the party?” the senior party spokesperson was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Sharing a post on Twitter, he also urged Punjab Congress in-charge Harish Rawat to introspect whether such individuals should remain a part of the grand old party. "I urge @harishrawatcmuk AICC Gen Secy I/C Punjab to seriously introspect that those who do not consider J&K to be a part of India & others who have ostensibly Pro Pakistan leanings should be a part of @INCPunjab. It mocks all those who shed blood for India," he wrote.Meanwhile, BJP leader Sambit Patra wanted to know whether Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had approved the appointments of Sidhu’s advisors. “Their comments are appalling and paint India in a bad picture. It shows the thought process of the party. Will Rahul Gandhi answer whether he appointed Sidhu's advisors?” Patra said.SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal has sought an FIR against Mali. “Does he stand with forces that are working against the nation? Kashmir is an integral part of India. The police should, in fact, register an FIR against him,” he was quoted as saying in a report.Another Akali leader Daljit Singh Cheema said it was none other than Sidhu who had hugged the Pakistan army chief and extended his friendship towards their prime minister when the two nations were not on particularly friendly terms. “When he is like that, why complain about advisors?” Cheema added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sidhu-summons-advisors-as-controversy-erupts-over-their-comments-on-kashmir-pak-101629700887312.html

In its report that has been submitted to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), the committee has spoken about the critical need of paediatric facilities, including doctors, staff, and equipment like ventilators and ambulances, if a large number of children got infected by the virus. It further said the available infrastructure was “no nowhere close” to the requirement, if the need arose.According to a report in The Times of India, the committee of experts was set up under the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) of the MHA. The experts have also written about prioritising a vaccination drive against the virus for children with co-morbidities and those with special needs.Also read | Are vaccine doses in the offing for children in India?While the country’s drug regulators have approved Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D vaccine for children above 12 years of age, the drive is yet to begin. Earlier, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya had hinted that children may start receiving their doses against the virus from September.The experts’ study titled ‘Third Wave Preparedness: Children Vulnerability and Recovery’ found, like several other previous related works, while children may not be severely infected by the virus, they may pass it on to others.Among their recommendations, the experts have said “a holistic home care model, immediate increase in paediatric medical capacities and prioritising mental health issues among children” were key at the moment. They have also proposed a model wherein Covid wards could be structured in a way that guardians of infected children could safely stay with them during the treatment.Stating that children are "not a homogeneous group and the policies cannot be the same for different groups of children, the panel also wrote about protection programmes for children from rural areas and disadvantaged communities, besides coming up with awareness campaigns to make them more familiar with protocols a report in NDTV said.While schools have started reopening in several states across the country, the report has suggested micro-management at the district level as proposed by the World Health Organisation to ensure safety at educational institutes.Also read | Karnataka to track health of 15 mn children to minimise impact of third waveRecently, Union information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur said the central government was fully prepared to deal with a possible third wave and special emphasis is being laid on strengthening paediatric care.A second wave of the virus earlier this year had wreaked havoc in the country with a large number of deaths being reported due to alleged crisis of oxygen supply, besides lack of critical infrastructure, including ICU beds. Government thinktank NITI Aayog has, meanwhile, suggested that preparations be made for 23 hospitalisations for every 100 positive cases in a future pandemic surge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-mha-panel-warns-of-third-wave-peak-in-oct-lack-of-infra-to-treat-kids-101629694242385.html
23-08-2021||India||Caste-based census a must: What Bihar politicians said ahead of meeting with PM Modi||A delegation of leaders from 10 political parties in Bihar is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday at 11am to discuss the issue of conducting a caste-based census. The delegation will be led by chief minister Nitish Kumar and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav will also accompany him.Kumar told reporters on Sunday that a caste-based census should be done at least once as not only Bihar but the whole country will benefit from it. “It is a crucial issue and we have been seeking this for a long time. It if works out, nothing could be better than that. Moreover, it would not just be for Bihar, people in the whole country will benefit from this. It should be done at least once. We will put forward our views from this angle. We will keep our views before the PM on Monday,” Kumar, whose Janata Dal (United) or JD(U) is an ally of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), told reporters.Yadav, the leader of Opposition in Bihar, said earlier this month that he wrote to PM Modi asking for a discussion on the caste-based census. He also said that Kumar has assured all opposition parties of a meeting with the Prime Minister and also written a letter to him on August 4. “If he has not been granted time for a week now, somehow it is an insult to the CM,” the RJD leader was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Also Read: Caste census: All eyes on meeting with PMThe young RJD leader warned that if the Centre failed to meet the demand of a caste-based census then they will be “left with no option but to sit on dharna at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi”.Bihar minister and BJP leader Janak Ram struck a more conciliatory tone. "I'm part of the delegation led by Nitish Kumar Ji that will meet PM today. On the issue of the caste-based census, whatever decision the PM takes should be acceptable to us," he told news agency ANI.Mukesh Sahni, president of Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) and minister in Bihar government, told ANI that a caste-based census will help in collecting information on many small castes who have been so far kept away from the purview of development. This will in turn let the government make better policies for them, he said. "I am a minister in Bihar for the animal and fisheries department and we are counting a number of animals to know how many horses, elephants, camels and other animals there are in our state. If you keep information about animals then why not keep information about humans," he added.Congress leader Ajeet Sharma too spoke in favour of a caste-based census insisting that it will bring an end to social hatred and that the ultimate aim of such a census exercise is to ensure reservation in government departments. "I believe that by conducting a caste census, social hatred will end. The purpose of the caste-based census is reservation. In all the government departments, whether it is the central government or the state government, all the people of each class should be given reservations according to the caste census," he said.Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Ajay Kumar also expressed similar sentiments and said that he asked Kumar to meet with the Prime Minister so that caste-based exploitation can be rectified with the help of caste-based census. “We told the CM that we should meet PM because it (caste-based census) is needed, caste-based exploitation takes place even today. A caste-based census will be like a mirror to help rectify this. So, we will meet PM today, under the leadership of CM Nitish Kumar,” Kumar told ANI.Besides Kumar and Yadav, JD(U) leader Vijay Kumar Choudhary, former chief minister and president of Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) Jitan Ram Manjhi, Congress legislature party leader Ajeet Sharma, BJP leader Janak Ram, Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Mahboob Alam, Akhtarul Imam of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, Mukesh Sahni of VIP, Suryakant Paswan of Communist Party of India and Ajay Kunar of Communist Party of India (Marxist), will also be present in the meeting.Members of the delegation were pictured leaving Bihar Bhavan in the capital and arriving at South Block on Monday morning to meet with the Prime Minister. Before heading off for the meeting Yadav told news agency ANI that caste-based census will help in making relevant benefit schemes, and a resolution on the same has already been passed twice in the state assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/castebased-census-a-must-what-bihar-politicians-said-ahead-of-meeting-with-pm-modi-101629693299246.html

To meet the prime minister is my cherished dream," he said, adding that his previous attempts to meet the PM did not fructify.Shah said that he has been following the prime minister on social media over the past four years, and his speech and actions have "touched my heart"."At one time, when he was delivering an address at a rally, he stopped suddenly on hearing the 'azaan' (Muslim call for prayer) leaving the public astonished … that gesture of our prime minister touched my heart and I became his ardent fan," he said.Shah said that over the past two and a half years, he has made several attempts to meet Prime Minister Modi in Delhi. "During the PM's last visit to Kashmir, security personnel did not allow me to meet him," he said."This time I am sure I will get a chance to meet the prime minister," Shah said.Asked about the change in Jammu and Kashmir after its special status was abrogated and made into a Union Territory from a state in 2019, he said the change is visible as Prime Minister Modi has his focus on Jammu and Kashmir. "There is a change in the situation, the development activities are taking place at a good pace and the Union Territory is marching forward," he said.Shah said he would like to discuss the problems of the educated and unemployed youths with the Modi and developing the industrial sector in the Union Territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/big-fan-of-pm-28-yr-old-who-is-walking-from-srinagar-with-hopes-to-meet-pm-modi-101629666489115.html

23-08-2021||India||Bengal CPI(M) suspends former state secretary’s daughter for article on CM Mamata||The West Bengal unit of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), on Saturday suspended Ajanta Biswas, daughter of former state secretary Anil Biswas, from the party for six months for writing an article on chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Jago Bangla, the daily mouthpiece of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). This is the first time disciplinary action has been taken by the Bengal CPI(M) against a member of a former state secretary’s family, party leaders said. Revered by CPI(M) workers to this day, Anil Biswas was one of the most successful strategists against the TMC. It is widely believed that the TMC managed to build up successful movements after Biswas died in 2006. He was also the editor of Ganashakti, the Bengal CPI(M)’s daily mouthpiece. Ajanta Biswas, a professor of history at Kolkata’s Rabindra Bharati University, wrote the article as part of a series published in July. Her piece projected the chief minister as a maverick and said the agitation she led against farmland acquisition for the Tata small car plant at Singur in Hooghly district contributed largely to her landmark victory against the Left in 2011. The Left Front’s 34-year-long rule ended that year. CPI(M) leaders faced major embarrassment when Jago Bangla printed the four-part series Biswas wrote on women empowerment in Bengal politics. The articles were prominently carried on the editorial page. Biswas was sent a show-cause notice by a CPI(M) area committee in the first week of August. The committee was not satisfied by her reply and recommended a six-month suspension. The decision was upheld by the CPI(M)’s Kolkata district committee on Saturday. The district committee meeting witnessed a debate, party leaders said. Sticking to the CPI(M)’s tradition, no leader commented on record. Biswas, too, did not give any reaction. Biswas has not been active in politics ever since her father died. Prior to that she was a prominent face of the Students’ Federation of India (SFI) unit at Presidency College (now a university) where she studied. The SFI is the students’ front of the CPI(M). While her first three research-based pieces highlighted figures such as Basanti Devi, Sarojini Naidu, Suniti Devi and others from the pre and post-Independence era, the last one focused entirely on Mamata Banerjee. It said that as a firebrand leader Banerjee played a historic role in state politics and ensured empowerment of women and movement at the grassroot level. Reacting to the suspension, TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh said, “Instead of taking action against Biswas the CPI(M) should have suspended its leaders because of whom the party faced the rout in the assembly polls.” For the first time since 1946, the Bengal CPI(M) has no legislator in the state assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-cpi-m-suspends-former-state-secretary-s-daughter-for-article-on-cm-mamata-101629663140580.html

The police also arrested accused, Sumit Singh alias Chintu and he was produced in court and remanded in police custody till Monday.A senior officer of the crime branch confirmed the matter and said, they have been recording statements of Sumit Singh to know the exact sequence of events while adding that the other accused in the case will be arrested soon. Bimal Agrawal alleged in his complaint that Singh, Vaze and Sumit Singh alias Chintu, Vinay Singh alias Bablu and Riyaz Bhati had threatened him and extorted monthly payments since January 2020 till March 2021 for “letting him run his hotels in Goregaon and Andheri without any police hassles”. The complainant claimed that he had paid ₹9 lakh in cash and given two Samsung Fold-2 mobile phones worth ₹212,000 to meet their extortion demands. Agrawal further claimed that he had learnt that the accused had also extorted money from other hotel owners and even bookies, in return for letting them run their betting business in Mumbai without any police intervention.Vaze, who is already in Taloja jail, was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with the Antilia explosives scare case and the subsequent murder of Thane resident Mansukh Hiren.This is the fifth criminal case filed against Singh following one in Marine Drive and four at a Thane police station. Coincidentally, Bimal Agrawal is the co-accused with former Mumbai police commissioner in an extortion case registered in Thane Nagar police station in July, 2021. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested Agrawal in connection with corruption and a hawala racket related to the IPL betting scandal in February 2017 while the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had also arrested him in December 2017 in connection with a money laundering probe in a cricket betting case.The Goregaon police registered a case under Section 384 (extortion), 385 (extortion and threat of physical harm) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-crime-branch-takes-over-probe-in-extortion-complaint-against-param-bir-singh-101629661879487.html

Last week, Kabul fell to the Taliban, and the ANA officer went into hiding.The officer, who previously completed his pre-commission training at the Indian Military Academy in Dehradun as part of an initiative between the two countries, says his life has turned upside down, not unlike millions others in his country. But the stakes are even higher for those like him, as Taliban fighters go door-to-door in search of armymen who once fought the terror group and of officials close to the erstwhile Ashraf Ghani government, he says.The ANA officer’s identity and rank in the force are being withheld for his safety.In touch with this writer, he says over instant messaging that he has been moving through different towns since August 15, when the Taliban conquered the Capital and claimed complete control of the country deserted by western forces after two decades.To avoid getting caught, he also hid his uniform and all documents that may give away his identity -- the remnants of his previous life.“We never thought in our wildest dreams that the Taliban would return so easily in just a few days. Our leaders sold us. Since the government was toppled and the top commanders surrendered, we hid our uniform and service weapons. We all then went into hiding from the Taliban,” the officer, whose parents are back home, tells this writer from an undisclosed town near Kabul.Since May, Taliban led a blitzkrieg campaign of capturing provinces in the country -- first, swathes of the countryside fell, and within a week in August, all urban provincial capitals, while American and allied forces withdrew.There are many of his colleagues from the force who have also gone into hiding after the Taliban came into power, he says. They fear a return to what they thought was a bygone era. Taliban ruled the country from 1996-2001 and implemented a harsh regime under Sharia law. Back then, any opposition was brutally stifled, public punishments such as stoning and beheading were not uncommon, and women weren’t allowed to study or work.“Like me, many other from the ANA are hiding in different places of the country. We are not scared at all, but only worried that they will take back the country to the period before 2001. We are waiting for the right time to rise against the Taliban who are still wild animals. We will not accept their rule,” the officer says.Nearly caughtAfter fleeing from his house last week, the officer was travelling in a friend’s car (with two others known to him) across towns for two days, with few belongings and little cash. “Initially, I was hiding for a couple of days in a relative’s home. There I had proper food... From there, I left for a friend’s home a few kilometres away a day ago (Thursday). It was that day when I encountered the Taliban at a checkpoint (in northern Afghanistan),” he says.“They stopped our car and using an expletive, asked us where we are coming from and where we are going. For a moment, we were worried, but we kept our cool and replied to them in a relaxed way to avoid any suspicion. They then allowed us to go after around 3 minutes of questioning us...“Fortunately, I had grown my beard few weeks ago,” he says, adding that his traditional attire of a pathani suit too may have helped him avert Taliban fighters’ suspicion at the check point.Uncertainty aheadThe 27-year-old says he was “shocked” to see weapons, provided by the US to the Afghan army over the years, in the hands of Taliban fighters. These included even America-made M4 assault rifles.“At the checkpoint, where we were stopped, I was shocked to see our weapons in the hands of those Taliban men. But that was the new reality we have to accept in Afghanistan. They got their hands on the modern weaponry provided to us by the Americans. We don’t know what to do, till when to hide like this.”HopeBut soon, his tone changes, and hope creeps in. Defiantly, the officer says he will support Ahmad Massoud, the son of Ahmad Shah Massoud, who was one of the main leaders of Afghanistan’s anti-Soviet resistance in the 1980s.He says: “We are lucky to still have leaders like Ahmad Massoud, who has vowed to stand for the people of Afghans against Taliban in Panjshir valley ( the only province free of Taliban until now).“The people of Afghanistan will soon standup against the Taliban.”Forces holding out against the Taliban in northern Afghanistan said on Saturday that they have taken three districts -- Pul-e-Hesar, Banu and Deh Salah -- in Baghlan province close to the Panjshir valley, where some government forces and other militia groups have gathered. Ahmad Massoud and former vice president Amrullah Saleh have vowed to resist the Taliban from Panjshir, which repelled both Soviet forces and the terror outfit in the 1980s and 1990s.Separate to this, uncoordinated demonstrations have broken out in some eastern cities and the capital Kabul in the last few days. Protesters, including women, have raised the red, green and black colours of the Afghan flag. Although Taliban have no acknowledged the incidents, in some instances reported by the media, their fighters have opened fire to quell the demonstrations -- contrary to their promises of a general amnesty for all Afghan soldiers and government officials.“There (Baghlan) the locals recaptured three districts from the Taliban after they (insurgents) carried door-to-door searches going against their (Taliban’s) promise of general amnesty. That enraged the locals, who then retaliated to capture the three districts.“God willing, this will spread to other areas as well,” the officer tells the reporter, before signing off.The ANA officer is known to the writer since his training days at IMA, Dehradun||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/hid-uniform-went-into-hiding-afghan-officer-s-account-101629660771927.html
23-08-2021||India||Dentists ignore proper work-up, rue govt docs in Bihar; appeal for sensitisation||A government dental doctor has flagged the Indian Dental Association (IDA), saying most dental surgeons, unlike general physicians and surgeons do not prescribe viral marker and other important blood investigations before doing a procedure, risking the patients and themselves. In an e-mail to the national IDA president and secretary on Sunday, Dr Jyotirmay Singh, associate professor, department of orthodontics and dentofacial orthopaedics, Patna Dental College and Hospital, said an average two out of 10 dental surgeons were advising blood investigations before a simple tooth extraction or any other dental procedure. “HIV (to check for AIDS), HBsAg (hepatitis B), HCV (hepatitis C), bleeding and clotting time (time taken for blood to clot during surgery), prothrombin time or PT (to detect a bleeding or excessive clotting disorder) are essential investigations a dental surgeon must prescribe before any procedure. Not doing tests for HIV/AIDS and hepatitis may lead to spread of infection arising out of a cut in the gums and put at risk the doctor and other patients through contaminated equipment,” said Dr Singh. Similarly, blood sugar (affects healing of wound), thyroid profile and complete blood count (to check haemoglobin, platelets, white blood corpuscle levels, etc. for other chronic diseases or long-term oral infection), are equally important, he added.“A simple tooth extraction procedure may require blood transfusion or even be fatal if the blood sugar, blood pressure, PT, bleeding and clotting time parameters are deranged. However, most dental surgeons, at best, prescribe teeth X-ray before doing a procedure like root canal treatment along with cap and bridge, scaling (teeth cleaning) and deep curettage (cleaning of gums), etc.” added Dr Singh. He urged the IDA to disseminate information about the importance of these tests among its members. By not prescribing such blood investigations, most dental surgeons were risking themselves and their patients to serious complications, said Dr Shivendra Choudhary, professor and head, department of dentistry at the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH). “At least 60% dentists in the state lack awareness and do not go for proper work-up by prescribing blood tests before a procedure. We do it at PMCH,” he said. “Some doctors, in private setup, do not want to miss patients by prescribing a battery of tests, which pinches a patient’s pocket because the investigations are expensive. I have personal experience of patients not returning to me for a procedure after consulting me when I have prescribed them essential blood tests. From doctors’ ethics, personal and patient safety, dentists need to follow a protocol and prescribe blood investigations before doing any oral intervention. Patients will come to terms with it when all doctors follow the protocol,” said Dr Choudhary. Dr Nimmi Singh, associate professor, oral medicine and radiology department of dentistry at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), also regretted the lack of awareness among dentists. “Many patients referred to our centre from rural areas are not prescribed viral marker or blood tests. However, at IGIMS, we insist on these tests, along with rapid antigen or real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for Covid-19, as dental surgeons are most prone to airborne and blood-transmitted diseases,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dentists-ignore-proper-work-up-rue-govt-docs-in-bihar-appeal-for-sensitisation-101629660139224.html
23-08-2021||India||Govt’s palm oil push based on disputed report||The Modi Cabinet’s decision last week to promote environmentally ruinous oil-palm plantations in the Andamans was a long time in the making and came on the heels of a go-ahead contained in a scientific body’s report, which environmentalists have disputed.The ₹11,000-crore National Mission on Edible Oils – Oil Palm (NMEO-OP) plan seeks to renew and expand oil palm plantations in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a fragile archipelago of 572 untrammeled islands, of which only 38 are inhabited. Palm oil, which is cheap, is used in most food items, from chocolate to pizza.India’s quest to increase oil palm isn’t new. A broad policy push came with the Special Programme on Oil Palm Area Expansion between 2011-12 and 2014-15. During the erstwhile 10th and 11th five-year plan periods, the government also ran a programme called ISOPOM, or the Integrated Scheme of Oilseeds, Pulses, Oil Palm and Maize.India’s huge demand has made it the world’s largest importer of vegetable oils, a base ingredient for cooking most common dishes. The country meets up to two-thirds of its domestic demand through imports.During 2020-21, India imported both crude and refined palm oil worth $5.8 billion. Edible oil is the country’s third most high-value import, after petroleum crude and gold.Edible oil plantations tend to replace natural tropical forests, depleting biodiversity. Environmental case studies in forested belts of Sumatra, Borneo and the Malay Peninsula — which produce 90% of global palm oil — have found that cultivation had eliminated pristine forests, pushing out wildlife, from orangutans to birds.The new push will likely require additional clearances from the Supreme Court, which had on May 7, 2002, ordered the phasing out of all “exotic plantations” to conserve the islands’ ecology, an official with the knowledge of the matter said. “Exotic” in this context refers to all species of flora and fauna not native to the islands.The new scheme seeks to bring additional 0.65 million hectares under oil palm by 2025-26 to reach a targeted one million hectares, up from 0.3 million hectares at present. This would result in crude palm oil output rising to 1.1 million tonnes by 2025-26 and up to 2.8 million tonnes by 2029-30.The scheme follows a long series of steps to steer clear of legal and procedural hurdles, HT has learnt.In January 2019, the administration of Andaman and Nicobar Islands had moved Supreme Court seeking a review of its strict conservation orders for the Andamans, the official said on condition of anonymity.The chief secretary of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Jitendra Narain, did not respond to a request for comment till the time of going to press.A second official said the Union agriculture ministry had deputed a scientific team from the Indian Institute of Oil Palm Research for a report on how to grow oil-palm sustainably at the request of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands administration. The panel’s report, finalised in end-2018, stated that agro-climatic conditions in the archipelago were congenial for oil palms.Ecologists dispute this. “The report was more about agricultural suitability. It is not an ecological study,” said Manjula Jaitley, an independent ecologist.Most of the oil-palm plantations in the archipelago, including in Little Andaman, are nearing the end of their natural productive shelf life of about 35 years. They now need to be grown anew.Oil-palm can be grown sustainably but only under strict conditions, including total avoidance of Andaman’s rainforests, said GV Ramanjaneyulu of the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture. However, there are very few non-forested open belts in the Andamans, ecologists say.The country’s second-most senior law officer had told the Supreme Court in October 2018, in a case regarding the rehabilitation of farmers in the islands, that there was hardly any land available for “compensatory afforestation” and “87% of the landmass is a natural notified forest”.According to top ecologist MD Madhusudan, grasslands are officially taken by policy makers to be wastelands, which “they are not” and so oil palm should not be there.The state-run A&N Islands Forest and Plantation Development Corporation Ltd owned about 1,583 hectares of red oil palm plantations in islets, such as Little Andamans. The company had four processing units whose operations were curtailed when the top court ordered the folding up of monoculture plantations.Deposing before a parliamentary committee in 2009, a senior official of the environment ministry had stated that “as per the recommendation of the Shekhar Singh Commission, the existing plantation of oil palm, rubber etc. are to be phased out and the land so released, insofar as it is forest land, be regenerated. No exotic species of fauna or flora should be introduced into the Islands”.The landmark Shekhar Singh commission, which was set up on the orders of the Supreme Court in 2002 and was formally known as the Forests and Allied Matters in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands Commission, had spelt out a series of recommendations to conserve the islands’ anthropological and ecological heritage, such as the preservation of aboriginal characteristics of its population, flora and fauna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govts-palm-oil-push-based-on-disputed-report-101629658758700.html
23-08-2021||India||2 BJP MLAs question CM over weekend, night curfew rules||At least two Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators in Karnataka have slammed the Basvaraj Bommai-led government for its weekend and night curfew rules on Covid-19, adding to the growing voices against the chief minister.Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal), the firebrand legislator from Bijapura city, on Sunday urged Bommai not to impose any restrictions on the upcoming Ganesha Chaturthi festival.“I have told the Chief Minister that if he imposes restrictions (during Ganesha festival) then I am not going to heed to it. I am telling the deputy commissioner and the superintendent of police present here that if you impose restrictions on Hindu festivals in Vijayapura then I will not remain silent. You can shoot me to silence me,” Yatnal said on Sunday.He charged the government with allowing others to organise events comprising 10,000 people and said when it comes to Ganesha festival, the administration imposes several restrictions in the name of Covid-19 control.Yatnal asked the district authorities to impose curbs on everyone if they really wish to check the spread of COVID-19 but not in a selective manner.The MLA also claimed that the third wave of COVID-19 will not have any effect on the district bordering Maharashtra as the vaccination is highest there and cases have come down substantially. He even questioned the government if corona comes only on weekends and at night, questioning the decision to impose restrictions in districts bordering Maharashtra and Kerala.Yatnal, who was left out of Bommai’s cabinet, has been an activly challenging the new government. He has also openly questioned the leadership and continues to criticise former chief minister BS Yediyurappa.BJP MLC AH Vishwanth too has questioned the decision on guidelines enforced in Mysuru district, about 125 kms from Bengaluru. The Bommai government has imposed weekend curfew in border districts and night curfew across the state as a measure to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the southern state.The chief minister, however, continues to turn a blind eye on political events by the BJP and the opposition who have flouted norms in Bengaluru and other districts. A Narayana Swamy, the union minister of state for social justice and empowerment has been attracting hundreds and thousands of people to his Janaashirwad Yatra rallies.These political rallies are going on unchecked by authorities who continue to remain vigilant on the public, warning them of punitive action for violating Covid-19 norms in the state. The Congress party in Karnataka slammed the BJP government for its actions against all others but themselves. “Vinay Kulkarni is a senior leader of the party, former minister and is a part of the Congress. It is good that a case of covid violations were slapped against Vinay Kulkarni. But in the same manner why are there no cases being registered against BJP national leaders for violating covid norms in Jana Ashirwad Yatra? Why are there no cases when BJP workers meetings? The government is using the law in whichever way it wants,” DK Shivakumar, the president of the Karnataka Congress said on Sunday. Karnataka has 20,556 active Covid-19 cases after the state reported 1,189 new infections the last 24-hour, the health department said in its bulletin on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-bjp-mlas-question-cm-over-weekend-night-curfew-rules-101629658339433.html
23-08-2021||India||3 robbers killed outside Assam bank in encounter||Three suspected robbers were killed in an encounter in the early hours of Sunday after the Assam Police in Kokrajhar district intercepted a group of men outside a bank in a bid to foil an alleged bank heist, officials said.According to the Kokrajhar police, the incident took place around 2:30 am in Bhotgaon, when the group was on their way to allegedly rob a branch of the Indian Bank.“There was a failed attempt at robbing the bank branch three months ago, and since then we had activated our information network. On Sunday, we got information that a team of robbers were on their way to rob the Indian Bank branch,” said Thube Prateek Vijay Kumar, superintendent of police, Kokrajhar.“When our personnel intercepted the robbers around 800m away from the bank, they started firing at us. Our team also fired back at them in retaliation, in which three of their members got injured. They were taken to RNB Civil Hospital in Kokrajhar, where they later succumbed,” he added.The deceased robbers have been identified as Sirajudaulah Sheikh from Mankachar district and Aminul Haque and Manowar Hussan from Goalpara district. The police said an operation to nab other robbers, who managed to escape from the scene, is on.According to the director-general of police (DGP) Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta, the police recovered two pistols, several rounds of used bullets, oxygen cylinders, gas cutters and other materials from the scene of the incident.There have been a steady rise in police encounters in Assam since May this year after the BJP-led government started a zero-tolerance policy against drugs, cattle smuggling and other heinous crimes. With Sunday’s incident, the number of those killed in such encounters since May 10 rose to 20. At least 31 others have been injured in such incidents across the state during that period.While opposition parties have accused the police of being ‘trigger-happy’, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who handles the home portfolio, has urged police to not to shy away from firing back at criminals while remaining within the ambit of law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-robbers-killed-outside-assam-bank-in-encounter-101629658220763.html
23-08-2021||India||Karnataka gears up to restart physical classes after 4 months||After a gap of nearly four months, the Karnataka government has decided to reopen physical classes for students in Classes 9, 10 and 12 from August 23, that would allow children to be back in their schools for the first time since the second wave of Covid-19 infections.Parents and guardians, however, have questioned the decision of the government.“Let them reopen schools where there is not much impact of Covid-19; but you cannot have one yardstick for the entire state,” Mohammed Shakeel, president of Voice of Parents, an association of parents and guardians, told Hindustan Times on Sunday.He said that Karnataka says it wants to implement the National Education Policy (NEP) which states that students will graduate only in their 12th standard, which gives them no reason to push children below these classes to make them rush back to schools.He, and multiple other parents, have even challenged the right of schools (private) to demand full school feels as well.Shakeel said that by reopening schools, the government is helping these private institutions to collect fees and then when the third wave comes, close them down again.However, according to Karnataka minister for primary and secondary education BC Nagesh, in the last one year, students didn’t receive the same kind of education in their homes, one of them being the technical aspect.“In the last one year, no matter how much we tried we could not give the students the same kind of education in their homes,” Nagesh said on Sunday.He listed a variety of reasons for the same which included the technical aspects like poor or no internet connectivity and the general disconnect between students and teachers in an online setting.The decision to reopen schools come at a time when the number of Covid-19 cases in Karnataka appears to have stabilised but fears of an imminent spike looms large over the state, especially with the impending third wave.Despite being known for its prowess in technology, the pandemic exposed the fault lines in Karnataka’s inequitable development; nearly half of the state’s young students lost an academic year due to internet accessibility--or the lack of it.In July, S Suresh Kumar, the then primary and secondary education minister had stated that around 9.3 million students out of the total 10.05 million across private and public schools in Karnataka, have been accounted for in terms of access to devices, internet, TV, radio and even email.Of the 9.3 million who have been accounted for, only 5,859,907 have smartphones/tablets while around 3,127,524 don’t have any access to such devices. Further, there are just 5,134,386 students who have access to the internet while 3,779,965 students do not have access to the internet, rendering the exercise of online classes as a redundant practice for these children, mostly from rural and backward regions of the state, Hindustan Times had reported on July 2.Reopening of schools has been a contentious issue, especially at a time when there appears to be a resurgence of new Covid-19 infections.Karnataka has 20,556 active Covid-19 cases after the state reported 1,189 new infections the last 24-hour, the health department said in its bulletin on Sunday.The death toll rose to 37,145 as 22 more people succumbed to the virus.The average positivity rate stands at 0.94% and the case fatality rate is 1.85%, according to government data.To make matters worse, the testing numbers in Karnataka too have dropped with just 125,158 tests conducted on Sunday, including 92,842 RT-PCR tests, data shows.While the state positivity rate is below 1%, there are at least eight districts that have a higher than state average, data from the Covid-19 war room shows.Dakshina Kannada, which has been at the receiving end of heavy rains, has an average positivity rate ( in the last seven days) of 3.5% until 5 pm on Saturday while Udupi has 2.71%.Kodagu has a positivity rate of 2.16% while it is 1.64% in Hassan.Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai will be visiting schools and colleges on Monday to check if guidelines for Covid-19 safety has been taken into account.Agriculture minister BC Patil as well as the BJP itself , have been asking children to return to school without fear.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-gears-up-to-restart-physical-classes-after-4-mnths-101629658219673.html
23-08-2021||India||Govt examining caste census demand, says Karnataka CM||With several stakeholders piling up pressure on the Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP)-led Karnataka government to release the findings of the socio-economic and education survey or caste census, chief minister Basvaraj Bommai on Sunday said that the state government is examining the growing developments around it.“Everybody’s free to meet the Prime Minister. The matter is there in front of court as well as the backward classes commission. We are examining it,” Bommai said on Sunday.The calls made in Karnataka, mirrors those in other states as well where several political parties, including allies of the BJP, have demanded the conducting a caste census.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, on Friday had said that a 10-party delegation would meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi to demand for conducting a caste-based census.Even in the just concluded Parliament session, several parties demanded that the 50% cap on reservation be removed.Former Karnataka chief minister and Congress’ leader of the opposition, Siddaramaiah, on Friday lashed out at the Bommai-led government for not releasing the findings of the 2015 caste census in Karnataka.The Siddaramaiah-led Congress government in Karnataka commissioned the “Socio-Economic and Education Survey”, better known as caste-census, in 2015 at a cost of around ₹150 crore, employing 1,06,000 people for 45 days to pose around 55 questions to 13.5 million households across the state.Caste has a huge bearing on Karnataka’s socio-cultural life and its volatile politics.Siddaramaiah has also been accused of holding back the findings of the report since his term in office ended only in 2018, three years after the report was prepared, allegedly due to pressure from his own partymen belonging to dominant communities, Hindustan Times reported on Saturday.The rise of reservation-related demands by dominant communities like the Panchamasali, one the largest sub-sects within the Lingayats, Vokkaligas, Valmiki and the Kuruba’s has added to the challenges of the Bommai government who has been trying to uphold the promises made by his predecessor, BS Yediyurappa.Any attempt in the past to release the findings of the report has been stonewalled by leaders of dominant communities who have threatened to revive protests.The Panchamasalis have threatened to revive its agitation if the Bommai government does not live up to its promise of changing their reservation status by September 15.A forum of extreme backward classes, who have approached the courts to get the findings of the 2015 caste census, have asked Bommai not to include the Panchamasali into 2A category which would further deprive these voiceless and invisible communities of benefits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-examining-caste-census-demand-says-karnataka-cm-101629658159270.html
23-08-2021||India||Local body polls first test for CM Bommai||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai is likely to face his first electoral challenge in the upcoming urban local body polls in 252 wards on September 3. The election would not just be a test for the newly sworn in chief minister but also an indication if the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been successful in consolidating its grass root level workers and whether its decision to give the top job to someone from North Karnataka would gain the confidence of the people in a region that continues to feel alienated against its more prosperous southern counterparts. Among those urban local bodies going to the polls are Hubbali-Dharwad, Belagavi and Kalaburagi, which are key districts in the northern part of the state. “It will be a three-way fight in Belagavi between BJP, Congress and MES (Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti),” said one Congress worker in the district, requesting not to be named. The decision to field candidates under their own banners and not through proxy this time is likely to add to the challenges of the national parties who have so far pursued a strategy of either supporting the pro-Kannada or pro-Marathi hopefuls. The urban local body polls come months after the ruling-BJP was routed by the Congress in May this year. The Congress had won six (119 out of the 266 total seats) of the 10 urban local body polls conducted in April 27 this year, leaving the BJP with just one and Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) with two victories. This included victories in BJP strongholds like Ballari and Thirthalli, which is in the home district of former chief minister BS Yediyudappa, Hindustan Times reported on May 1. The alleged mishandling of Covid-19 by Yediyurappa, people aware of the developments said, was among the main reasons for the poor outing by the BJP in the April urban local body polls. Already hit with dissent from within the BJP, allegations of mismanagement of timely flood and drought relief and legislators continuing to air their displeasure in public over being overlooked for the Cabinet, the upcoming polls are likely to pile the challenges on Bommai and also presents an opportunity for the chief minister to step out of the shadow of his mentor and predecessor, Yediyurappa. The MES, a pro-Maharashtra outfit that has been fighting to be included with the neighbouring state, have alleged that those in power are trying to “disturb the homogeneity of the society” in Belagavi. “They (ruling party) have bifurcated the wards in an unscientific way, dividing it on basis like majority,” Deepak Dalvi, the president of the MES said. He said that there has been a systematic effort to ensure the MES votes are split or wards have been categorized in a way that it will be disadvantageous for the separatist party. Belagavi is also the home district of the powerful “Jarkiholi brothers” who have, in the past, put their own interests before the party’s. Ramesh and Balachandra Jarkiholi, both with the BJP, have been holding meetings with dissidents after they were left out of the Bommai Cabinet. Urban local body polls and the yet-to-be announced gram and zilla panchayat polls are key to get the pulse of the cadre at grass root levels which would help all three parties understand if their efforts to consolidate support base before the 2023 assembly elections. There is a feeling of neglect in Kalaburagi district, a divisional headquarters, after Bommai decided against anyone from this region in his Cabinet. “If there was a minister from this region, it could have boosted voting,” said a BJP worker from the district. He, however, added that the party is strong in the district and legislators are coming together to work for the polls. In 2019, the BJP managed to oust 11-time winner and Congress behemoth, Mallikarjuna Kharge in the Lok Sabha polls by backing his former aide who jumped to the BJP, Umesh Jadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/local-body-polls-first-test-for-cm-bommai-101629658099558.html
23-08-2021||India||Entering airport looked nearly impossible: Kabul evacuees||The Taliban segregated an Indian group headed to the Kabul airport for evacuation from the war-torn country, with a journey only a few kilometres-long to the facility appearing impossible because of blocked roads and the presence of militia, people who landed in India after precarious journey out of Afghanistan said on Sunday.India on Sunday brought back 540 people, including 475 of its nationals and two Afghan lawmakers, on four flights from different destinations as part of the mission to evacuate its nationals and Afghan partners from Kabul amid the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan because of a Taliban takeover.“When the situation changed there (in Afghanistan), we decided to go back home. There was no issue of food there. They (Taliban) took the photocopy of our passports and asked us our names besides they checked our passports and asked where we worked. Later, they left,” a passenger told reporters at the Ghaziabad’s Hindan airbase, where the evacuation flights landed on Sunday morning.A total of 168 people, including 107 Indians and 23 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus, were flown from Kabul to the Hindan airbase near Delhi in the Indian Air Force (IAF) C-17 Globemaster aircraft. Another group of 87 Indians and two Nepalese nationals were brought back in a special Air India flight from Dushanbe, a day after they were evacuated to the Tajikistan capital in an IAF 130J transport aircraft, officials said. Another 281 Indians, most of them employees of firms from Western countries that were active in Afghanistan, were flown back from Doha to Delhi on two special flights. These Indians had been flown out to Qatar on US and NATO flights over the past few days.Another passenger, Kolkata-based Dominic S Biswas, who was working in Afghanistan as an auditor of food quality for the past 10 months, shared his harrowing few days in the capital city. “I was in Kabul main city. There was a huge crowd at the Kabul airport, and I was stuck up for four days. I was outside the airport and could not move in. There was scheduling and rescheduling...‘Taliban se dar laga, bahut laga (We were very scared of the Taliban)’.”The group also included Afghan lawmakers Anarkali Honaryar and Narender Singh Khalsa and their families.“India is our second home. We have been living there for generations. We pray to God that Afghanistan is rebuilt, and we can go back there to tend to our gurdwaras and temples and serve the people,” Khalsa was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. “I feel like crying...Everything that was built in the last 20 years is now finished. It’s zero now,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Honaryar, a member of the Upper House of Afghan Parliament, told news agency PTI in a video message: “I thank the government of India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Ministry of External Affairs and the Indian Air Force for lifting us from Kabul and saving my life.”Their emotions were shared by many, who hailed the efforts of the Indian government in ensuring their safe arrival.“Situation was deteriorating in Afghanistan, so I came here with my daughter & two grandchildren. Our Indian brothers and sisters came to our rescue. They (Taliban) burnt down my house. I thank India for helping us,” news agency ANI quoted an Afghan national as saying.Dehradun-based Praveen (44), who was among 87 Indians brought back in a special Air India flight from Tajikistan, said “breathing the air of our motherland is just bliss”.A resident of Premnagar area of Dehradun, Praveen was among 40 ex-servicemen from Uttarakhand who worked at the Denmark embassy in Kabul as security assistants.“When we finally touched down New Delhi airport on Sunday at 5.45 am from Tajikistan, it was like we got a second life as the situation in Afghanistan was very serious,” he added.Dilbahadur, also an ex-serviceman, said the journey back home seemed impossible at a point. He went to Afghanistan for the first time just a month ago and said their contingent had to wait for about six hours to enter the airport and were asked by the Taliban to stand separately from the locals.“Outside the airport, the Taliban men told us to stand in a separate place when we told them that we are Indians. They assured us that they won’t harm us and will let us go to the airport. I was not scared but seeing the Taliban... we were a little worried as it was difficult to believe their assurance. If they wanted, they could have shot us as it was normal for them,” he said.“Though we lived only about 2km away from the Kabul airport, it was almost impossible to reach there as all the roads were blocked by either Taliban or the locals. The Indian embassy officials then coordinated with the US Army which came to take us to the airport ensuring our safety,” he added.Explaining the situation near the airport, Dilbahadur said, though the Taliban were not targeting the Indians, they were beating the local residents to stop them from entering the airport. “We felt sorry for the poor locals who were being beaten by the Taliban to scatter them away from the airport. There were small children being carried by their parents trying to enter the airport by jumping over the fence. It was a very heart-wrenching scene.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/entering-airport-looked-nearly-impossible-kabul-evacuees-101629657667677.html
23-08-2021||India||Indians, Afghan refugees brought safely from Kabul||India on Sunday evacuated nearly 540 people, including 475 of its nationals, who were in Afghanistan on four flights from different destinations as the government sped up efforts to bring back all citizens after the situation at Kabul airport deteriorated further.A total of 87 Indians and two Nepalese citizens were flown from the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe to Delhi in a special Air India flight on Sunday morning. They were earlier evacuated from Kabul to Dushanbe in a C-130 Hercules aircraft of the Indian Air Force (IAF) on Saturday.Another 168 people, including 107 Indians and 23 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus, were flown out of Kabul in a C-17 heavy lift aircraft and reached the Hindan airbase later on Sunday.Afghan lawmakers Anarkali Honaryar and Narender Singh Khalsa and their families were among the Sikhs and Hindus. They were escorted into Kabul airport by international forces after the Taliban prevented a group of more than 70 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus from entering the area on Saturday.Another 281 Indians, most of them employees of firms from Western countries that were active in Afghanistan, were flown back from Doha to Delhi on two special flights. These Indians had been flown out to Qatar on US and NATO flights over the past few days.People familiar with the developments said on condition of anonymity that there were no specific figures for the Indians who remained in Afghanistan, though the indications were that this would be a low number. Efforts are still on to register all Indians who are still in the war-torn country and evacuate them as quickly as possible along with Afghan nationals, including Sikhs and Hindus.The people acknowledged that Afghan citizens granted Indian visas were facing problems in accessing Kabul airport. “The Taliban are specifically checking for people with Afghan passports and Indian visas and driving them back,” one of the people said.Another problem in evacuations is the journey from different parts of Kabul to the airport because the Taliban have set up check posts across the capital. Adding to the worries of the Indian side are reports that terrorists from Pakistan-based groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Haqqani Network are present among the Taliban.The C-130 aircraft that went to Kabul also flew in a small team of Indian officials who are currently stationed at the airport to help with further evacuations and to liaise with the US and other countries for assistance. US and foreign troops are currently playing a key role in escorting people into the airport, especially those being threatened by the Taliban.Dushanbe will continue to remain a key centre for Indian evacuation flights as there are limited space and time slots at Kabul airport.As reports emerged of Taliban fighters opening fire and using harsh methods to control thousands of people converging on Kabul airport, the US embassy issued a security alert on Saturday advising American citizens to avoid travelling to the airport because of “potential security threats outside the gates”. Around 20 people have died at the airport over the past week.The US alert was issued following intelligence reports that the Islamic State could target Americans or flights in the Afghan capital.US defence secretary Lloyd Austin activated the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, a rarely used programme, to compel six commercial airlines to provide 18 aircraft to speed up the evacuation efforts. The Guardian reported the perceived threat from the Islamic State had led US military planes to “perform rapid, diving combat landings” at Kabul. Other aircraft fired flares on takeoff to confuse possible heat-seeking missiles targeting planes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indians-afghan-refugees-brought-safely-from-kabul-101629657259490.html
23-08-2021||India||CBSE to reintroduce communicative English, Sanskrit for Class 9, 10||New Delhi: In line with the new National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has decided to reintroduce the communicative English and Sanskrit “from the academic year 2022-23 in class 9 and subsequently in class 10 in the year 2023-24”. The board was offering these languages at two levels -- communicative and core -- before discontinuing the communicative option in the academic session 2018-19. While communicative options in language courses offer content about communication skills and day-to-day language usage, core courses focus on poetry, dramas, and concept based reading and writing in the subject.In a letter addressing the principals of all its affiliated schools, CBSE director (Academics) Joseph Emmanuel said, “In pursuance to recommendation of National Education Policy 2020 regarding availability of all subjects and corresponding assessments at two levels as per the needs and interest of students, CBSE is planning to offer English and Sanskrit at two levels from the academic year 2022-23 in class IX and subsequently in class X in the year 2023-24.The Board will offer communicative based curricula which CBSE used to offer in these languages till the year 2018 in these languages.” The letter dated August 3 was shared with the principals last week.“As NEP stresses on using an approach to learning that highlights the importance of real life contexts and enabling students to apply their knowledge in real life scenarios, communicative approach to languages would certainly develop the student’s competence to communicate in the target language (communicative competence), with an enhanced focus on real-life situations,” he added.The NEP was approved by the Union cabinet in July last year.Presently, the board is offering Mathematics (basic and standard) and Hindi (A and B) at two levels. The Union education ministry had in January announced that the CBSE will start offering English and Sanskrit at two-levels as well. “The NEP advocates offering all subjects at two levels to meet the interests and needs of all students. The board is in process of providing such an option in more subjects,” a senior official at the CBSE said.The board has asked all its schools to provide tentative data on the number of students who might be interested in opting for communicative English and communicative Sanskrit in class 9 next year. “We have asked for the details so that the board can ensure that all the required books in communicative English and communicative Sanskrit be available before the beginning of the next academic session,” the official added.Meanwhile, several principals welcomed the move. “This decision to introduce Communicative English and Communicative Sanskrit will not only promote more application-based understanding of languages, but also provide maximum choices to students as advocated by the NEP,” said Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini.Ajeet Kumar Sharma, principal of a government school in Ghaziabad, said, “It will be really good for government school students who are not very comfortable with English (core). They will now be able to perform well in the language with communicative English as an option.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbse-to-reintroduce-communicative-english-sanskrit-for-class-9-10-101629657198505.html
23-08-2021||India||TN BJP gifts cars to four district secretaries for assembly seat wins||Four of BJP’s district presidents in Tamil Nadu received an SUV each on Sunday as a reward for helping the party win four assembly seats in the April 6 assembly election held in Tamil Nadu, for which results were announced on May 2. Ex-Tamil Nadu BJP chief L Murugan, who has now been elevated as a Union minister of state, had promised an Innova car to district functionaries, who worked to ensure the victory of the party’s MLA candidates in the 2021 Assembly polls. After a gap of twenty years, the BJP entered the assembly in Tamil Nadu this May with four MLAs. BJP contested 20 seats as part of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) led the alliance in Tamil Nadu, and won in Tirunelveli, Nagercoil, Modakurichi apart from a nail-biting contest in Coimbatore South. Murugan had said after their win is a strike against all those who ridiculed that BJP’s symbol lotus will never bloom in Tamil Nadu. Murugan is touring the state as part of the Jan Aashirwad Yatra. At the Chennai BJP office, he distributed the car keys of Toyota Innova Crysta to Maharajan (Tirunelveli), Dharmaraj (Kanyakumari), Sivasubramanian (Erode), and Nandakumar (Coimbatore). “This was done to recognise hard-working district secretaries who won despite the climate here being against us,” said senior BJP leader C P Radhakrishnan. “Previously, such rewards were given by the DMK. It’s the first time we are doing it, and party workers will be enthused.” The cars were purchased using party funds. Such rewards to district secretaries are common in Tamil Nadu, where the DMK and AIADMK have offered gold to party functionaries who bring successful election results. The national party has been trying to get a foothold into the Dravidian heartland after the demise of former chief ministers J Jayalalithaa in December 2016 and M Karunanidhi in August 2018. While it is evident that the Dravidian parties still hold sway in TN, with the DMK winning a majority and the AIADMK finishing second with 66 seats, the BJP’s modest performance has kept its ambition of becoming a dominant force in the state by 2026, alive. The BJP had last won four seats in Tamil Nadu in 2001 in alliance with the DMK. Now the BJP is focused on the upcoming local body polls for which the party has formed a 17-member panel for preparations. The alliance with the AIADMK is likely to continue. “Some more work and attention is all that’s required for the BJP to grow in Tamil Nadu,” said Radhakrishnan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-bjp-gifts-cars-to-four-district-secretaries-for-assembly-seat-wins-101629657081213.html
23-08-2021||India||DMK worker murder case: Two more held||The Chennai City police Saturday arrested a couple in connection with the murder of DMK functionary Sampath Kumar in full public view here last week.Six persons, including Kumar’s neighbours Vinayagam, 47 and his wife, Karpagam,41, are already in police custody. Vinayagam’s relative Dravida Balaji, 50, and his wife, Amirtham, 48, are the latest to be arrested here.A case was registered based on a complaint by Kumar’s son, Gopinath. The accused have been booked under section 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint), 147 (rioting), 148 (armed with a deadly weapon) and 302 (murder).CCTV footage of the crime, which happened around 9.15 pm at one of the busiest localities in Chennai’s Anna Nagar shows two men on a bike colliding with Kumar and attacking him with machetes. What’s even more bizarre is that almost immediately more men join and attack Kumar multiple times while he is lying motionless on the arterial road even as cars and two-wheelers continue to pass them in the two-way road. “People assumed it’s an accident because he had fallen on the road yet, no one helped him. Sadly, that’s how bystanders are these days,” said inspector Rajeesh Babu. “But it was a food delivery boy who saw the crime and ran to the station and informed us, and we immediately rushed to the spot.”The Anna Nagar police reached the scene and found Kumar dead. From his ID card, they found that he was attacked while he was on his way home in another locality. The post-mortem report of the deceased says that he died due to multiple injuries.The 51-year-old DMK functionary was involved in a drinking water delivery business. “There are multiple motives in this case,” explained assistant commissioner of police Augustine Paul Sudhakar. Preliminary investigations have revealed that Kumar was suspected to have given a tip-off to special police about a criminal named Lenin in his locality, who was arrested last year for heinous crimes but is out on bail. Lenin reportedly often took refuge in Vinayagam’s house. “The neighbours had several civil disputes between them, and they used to quarrel often,” said Sudhakar. All this had driven Vinayagam, 47 to plan Kumar’s murder with his wife Karpagam,41, the police said.The investigating team arrested Kumar’s neighbours Vinayagam, 47 and his wife, Karpagam,41, Vinayagam’s relative Dravida Balaji, 50 and his wife, Amirtham, 48. Four others surrendered in the case--Hari Kumar (21), Sridharan (25), Mohanavel (21) and Naveen Kumar (24). The police have also seized weapons, including two machetes.“More arrests are likely to happen in this case. Lenin is absconding, and we are investigating if he had anything to do with this case behind the scenes,” said inspector Rajeesh Babu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dmkworker-murder-case-two-more-held-101629657079192.html
23-08-2021||India||TN begins home vaccination for 80+, 24x7 jabs at hospitals||Tamil Nadu government on Sunday started the door-to-door vaccination for people above the age of 80 in Chennai, and round-the-clock vaccination will be available in government medical college hospitals across the state from Monday, revising its approach to increase inoculation coverage. “These initiatives will not only increase vaccine coverage but will also provide additional facilities to people to be comfortable and vaccinated. Depending on the response, we will decide on rolling it out across the state,” said Dr T S Selvavinayagam, director of the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive (DPH). This comes following a state government survey on vaccine hesitancy, which found that the elderly population in Tamil Nadu was the most hesitant compared to other age categories. Hindustan Times had earlier reported, using the CoWin vaccination data, that Tamil Nadu’s coverage of the elderly was the lowest in the country. For every hundred elderly population, the state has administered only 44 doses as of the first week of August. The survey, which was carried out by the DPH in July, showed that hesitancy among those who were above the age of 60 was 27.6%, while for those in the 18-45 age category was 16.9%, and in the 45-60 age category it was 18.2%. Selvavinayagam said that the survey showed the health department that they need to create a set-up where vaccines were available closer to homes. The Greater Chennai Corporation, which already does home vaccination for people with severe disabilities, has been informally vaccinating senior citizens on a case-by-case basis. On Sunday, this was formalised with senior DMK leaders flagging off 15 cars, one for each of the 15 zones of Chennai. A team for each of the zones, comprising medical professionals and civic officials will go around for vaccination. At least 100k people aged above 80 are likely to get vaccinated at home in the next few months, officials said. Medical experts said that senior citizens have avoided getting vaccinated for multiple reasons such as fear of vaccine side effects and safety due to their comorbidities. They added that given schools and colleges are reopening from September 1, the elderly need to be vaccinated so that students don’t spread the infection at home. “Elderly may also not come forward to hospitals either because it isn’t feasible or they’re afraid they will catch an infection from the hospitals,” said Dr Prabhdeep Kaur, deputy director, National Institute of Epidemiology. The round-the-clock vaccination centres are expected to be more helpful to employees who work night shifts and travellers. In Chennai, it will come in five government hospitals. “The pace of vaccination coverage will be faster,” health minister M Subramanian told reporters. The state had earlier introduced free vaccination at private hospitals with the help of CSR funds. Since vaccination was rolled out in India, Tamil Nadu was a slow starter in the drive as compared to other states initially due to vaccine hesitancy and later due to short supply. This began to change into a demand for vaccines during the peak of the second wave of coronavirus in May and June which saw more hospitalisation and deaths. Tamil Nadu came close to halting the drive several times since June since vaccines are being fully utilised as and when a consignment arrives. But supply has been better now, say, officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tnbegins-home-vaccination-for-80-24x7-jabs-at-hospitals-101629657020275.html

This means that the number of active cases has dropped over 90% from peak levels seen during India’s second wave.Tracking active cases (those people who are still under treatment for the viral disease) in a region is crucial because this figure directly reflects the pressure on the health care system in a region.The development comes at a time when India is nearing a significant milestone of administering at least one shot of the Covid vaccine to nearly half of the country’s adult population.Till Sunday morning, the latest data made available by the Union health ministry show that over 581.5 million shots have been administered to more than 450.7 million people across the country – 320 million people having been partially vaccinated and 130.7 million people received both doses of the vaccine. When seen alongside population projections for 2021 by Census of India, which places the number of adults in the country at 940 million, this means that around 48% of adults in the country have been administered jabs (34% received a single dose, and 14% received both).On Sunday, the country recorded 25,426 new infections of the disease and 385 new deaths, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.The seven-day average of new infections in the country, meanwhile, has dropped to a 156-day low of 31,965 as cases continued to drop nearly across the country. This number, which represents a region’s Covid curve, had touched a peak of 391,819 for the week ending May 9, and has since dropped nearly 92% from peak levels.“Sustained and collaborative efforts by the Centre and the states/UTs continue the trend of less than 50,000 daily new cases that is being reported for 56 consecutive days now,” the Union health ministry said in a statement on Sunday.Even Kerala, which is currently the biggest outbreak centre in the country accounting for nearly half of India’s active cases and was the only state where the outbreak was expanding at an alarming rate, has now started seeing a drop in cases numbers. On Sunday, the southern state recorded 10,402 new Covid-19 cases – the lowest in a single day in over a month.The daily positivity rate – the proportion of samples tested returning positive for the Sars-CoV-2 – on Saturday was at 1.8%. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that when a region’s positivity rate remains below 5% threshold, it implies that the government is testing adequately to control the outbreak. In India, the positivity rate has now remained below the 5% threshold for over 80 days, data shows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/active-covid-19-cases-drop-to-lowest-in-over-150-days-data-101629656664435.html
23-08-2021||India||Monsoon likely to enter partial ‘break’ phase from today: IMD||Monsoon is likely to enter a partial “break” phase once again with scanty rainfall expected over northwest and west India for at least a week from Monday onwards, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).There was a “break” in monsoon rains from June 29 to July 11 and a very weak monsoon was witnessed in the first two weeks of August also leading to significant deficit in rains in the month across the country. Monsoon revived over northwest India on August 19 but it is likely to weaken again from August 24, IMD said.“Heavy rainfall is expected till end of Sunday but rainfall over northwest India is expected to reduce significantly from Monday. We are expecting weak monsoon conditions to set in again for at least 5 days. No major rainfall is expected over the west coast or northwest India but the eastern states particularly northeast will receive rainfall. This is mainly due to shifting of the monsoon trough to the north over the Himalayan foothills. So, the plains will remain largely dry,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, IMD.“We are entering a partial break monsoon phase. It will be the third during this season. Due to the monsoon trough shifting to the north most parts of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan will remain dry till the end of month. No significant rain is expected over Gujarat or Maharashtra either. There may be rains over Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. It will be a partial break in monsoon because rains are expected to continue over east and northeast India,” explained Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate change and meteorology, Skymet Weather.There is a 26.6% rain deficit in August over the country with 27.1% deficiency over northwest India, 35.4% deficiency over central India, 29.9% deficiency over south peninsula and 6.6% deficiency over east and northeast India. During monsoon season since June 1, there has been 8% deficiency in rain over the country with 11% deficiency over northwest India, 11% deficiency over east and northeast India, 10% deficiency over central India and 4% excess over peninsular India.The western end of the monsoon trough is lying to the south of its normal position and the eastern end lying to the north of its normal position. The western end is very likely to shift gradually northwards from August 23. A cyclonic circulation is lying over northeast Rajasthan and adjoining northwest Madhya Pradesh in lower tropospheric levels. Another cyclonic circulation is lying over Tamil Nadu and adjoining Sri Lanka coasts.A trough is running from northeast Rajasthan to south Tamil Nadu and adjoining Sri Lanka coasts across central parts of Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha, Telangana, Rayalaseema and north Tamil Nadu. Due to these meteorological conditions, rainfall activity over plains of northwest India and adjoining Central India is likely to continue till August 23 and reduce thereafter, IMD predicted.Rainfall is expected to reduce over Maharashtra and the west coast also but scattered to fairly widespread activity very likely over southern Peninsular India during next 5 days. Isolated heavy rainfall is likely over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal till August 24.There is likely to be enhanced rainfall activity over northeast India, Sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim and Bihar from August 24. Widespread rainfall activity with isolated heavy falls is very likely to continue over northeast India, Sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim and Bihar till August 24, and increase in intensity thereafter with isolated very heavy rainfall over Sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam and Meghalaya till August 2, IMD said.Isolated extremely heavy rain (over 20 cm) is also likely over Assam and Meghalaya on August 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-likely-to-enter-partial-break-phase-from-today-imd-101629656121280.html
23-08-2021||Today's||A tale of four presidents, Afghanistan, and India||“It was never expected that we will have victory in Afghanistan,” Taliban leader Mullah Baradar said after his return to Kabul. He was certainly not alone in expressing surprise at the sudden collapse of the Afghan government and the Taliban’s complete takeover.In the aftermath, there is plenty of blame to go around. Officials in several regional capitals played an active role in facilitating the Taliban’s return to power. Many Afghans feel betrayed by their own country’s erstwhile leadership, with good reason. Others in the international community arguably did not do enough. But there is no escaping the fact that significant failures lay with successive United States (US) leaders for the execution of the Afghanistan war, the doomed reconciliation process, and the chaotic withdrawal.The US intervention in Afghanistan followed the devastating 9/11 attacks by al-Qaeda, which struck the nerve centres of the US military and financial markets. Under George W Bush, the US easily ousted the Taliban government in Afghanistan, which had sheltered al-Qaeda’s leadership. But the Bush administration was also worried about a large-scale military commitment and maintained only a small military footprint in Afghanistan at the outset. The US intervention, therefore, involved aerial bombardment, the extensive use of special operations forces, and local alliances on the ground.Also Read | A national consensus on AfghanistanFor India, the US policy reversal after the 1980s, when it had actively supported the mujahideen in Afghanistan, and the 1990s, when it largely ignored the region, was welcome. The Taliban was no friend of India, as the 1999 hijacking of an Indian Airlines aircraft made evident, and the group had supported and allied with India-focused terrorists, including Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba.Yet, despite ousting the Taliban, the Bush administration opted to work with Pakistan. It remained wary of coordination with India in Afghanistan, even as it deepened cooperation with New Delhi on defence and civilian nuclear energy. After 2003, the Bush administration also shifted its focus and resources to the intervention in Iraq.Barack Obama was elected president as US forces began the drawdown from Iraq. The security situation in Afghanistan had deteriorated sharply, and Obama — while sceptical of foreign military intervention — had campaigned on Afghanistan being a just war. He commissioned Bruce Riedel to conduct an inter-agency review of Afghanistan and Pakistan policy. Richard Holbrooke was appointed Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, and a surge of US military forces was deployed under General Stanley McChrystal to wage a counterinsurgency campaign in Afghanistan akin to the one waged in Iraq.Obama, more than any other US president, took the fight to Pakistan. Afghanistan became a frontline State against Pakistan, rather than the other way around, and US-Pakistan relations deteriorated sharply. North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Pakistani forces exchanged fire; US supply lines were sabotaged; a US consular employee named Raymond Davis was arrested for killing two Pakistanis; and US special operations forces killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad.But the Obama administration also clung to the notion that Pakistan could be dissuaded from its support for terrorists through the brokering of an India-Pakistan agreement on Jammu and Kashmir. India rebuffed efforts to interfere in what it considered a bilateral matter. Additionally, the US sought to build leverage with Pakistan by increasing civilian assistance under the Kerry-Lugar-Berman Act, in what proved to be a wasteful and futile exercise. With an eye on re-election, Obama further undercut his efforts by prematurely announcing a drawdown of forces.Donald Trump’s election was followed by the rise of the Islamic State-Khorasan and the proliferation of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) against US forces. At the insistence of national security adviser HR McMaster, Trump repledged US military support for Afghanistan. His initial strategy was welcomed in New Delhi, as were greater coordination efforts between Washington, Kabul, and New Delhi.But following McMaster’s dismissal in 2018, Trump reversed course. Zalmay Khalilzad was made the primary interlocutor for talks with the Taliban, and a flimsy agreement was hastily brokered, Taliban prisoners were released, and a drawdown of US forces was initiated.Finally, Joe Biden and his advisers gave high priority to India in their first six months in office. Coordination on Afghanistan increased in several respects. Yet Biden was committed to a quick and complete withdrawal, resulting in the swift collapse of the Afghan government in August. The outcome, and the manner in which it came about, will undoubtedly prove harmful for India’s regional security interests.From 2001 to 2020, the US was neither willing to commit too much for too long to Afghanistan, nor was it willing to face the potentially disastrous consequences of withdrawal. The result was the worst of all worlds — over a trillion dollars spent and thousands of lives lost with little to show for it.From an Indian vantage point, each of the four successive US administrations took important steps that aligned with India’s desired end state for regional security. Yet, for different reasons, all four administrations also adopted policies that frustrated, undercut, or otherwise harmed Indian interests. Whether a different set of choices could have resulted in better outcomes for Afghanistan, India, and the US will be a matter for historians to debate in the coming years and decades.Dhruva Jaishankar is executive director of ORF-America The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/a-tale-of-four-presidents-afghanistan-and-india-101629722725064.html
23-08-2021||Today's||Taliban’s rhetoric indicates the limits of Islamist project and jihadism||The Taliban’s conquest of Afghanistan has reignited many fears. Will the group cast off its past of flagrant barbarity? As their fighters breached Kabul and their top leaders homed in on the presidential palace amid a tearful recitation of the Quran’s 110th chapter, I was transported back to a world I had visited earlier.I had had a professional opportunity to embed with Pakistani forces in the Taliban holdouts in the Khyber Pakhtunkwa province in 2012. My interests didn’t boil down to geopolitical questions about how spectacularly Pakistan’s forces cleared many of these hideouts that they and the Americans had helped to prop up in the first place. I instead pivoted towards understanding my own faith in all its dimensions.The Taliban have sought to convey a less dogmatic position on governance this time, vowing to avoid reprisal attacks and respect people’s basic rights. It’s early days still to tell whether this is a ruse for global acceptance or proof of reform.But irrespective of how it pans out, the Taliban’s apparent turning a new leaf highlights the limits of Islamism, and in particular, its most potent tool — jihadism. Many ordinary people are still confused about what Islam is, and isn’t. A simple acceptance of monotheism is the sine qua non of Islam, the faith. On the other hand, Islamism seeks to build more structures drawn from the normative aspects of the faith. Islamism and, by extension, jihadism are primarily a response to colonialism, imperialism and modernity itself. To that extent, Islam is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for violent modern-day jihad.Also Read | In Perspective: Taliban, tech and the fight for Afghanistan’s futureThe effects of violent jihad have been egregiously felt across the modern world. This is not to suggest that non-Islamic sources of war have been any less lethal. The Fat Man and Little Boy obliterated at least 220,000 lives in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in singular strikes, nearly the same number of people killed in all of modern jihad’s history.Jihad under Prophet Mohammed had ground rules. Combatants could take on only combatants, unless there was an explicit “command” from God. Mutilation and killing of women, children, old and the infirm were prohibited. Suicide is prohibited in Islam. Regardless of what is the right jihad, one finds compelling reasons why all Islamist organisations must shun jihad. The nature of problems faced by Muslims today are different from those 1,400 years ago, when Prophet Mohammed blazed through the sands of Badr or Al Khandiq following “direct divine sanction” to battle his enemies.Islam is not compatible with modernity, defined by the ever-enlarging scope of universal freedoms, rights and equality. No religion is. But modernity’s underlying values are not repugnant to classical Islam. Concepts such as equality and democracy are not alien to Islamic aspirations (“White men are not superior to Black men and Black men are not superior to White men”, the Prophet said in his last sermon). Zakat is one of the earliest forms of economic redistribution known to humankind.The Taliban has rejected the possibility of a democratic State. This rejection is un-Islamic. Islamic societies have been governed by institutions called shoora, an inflection of the word “mashwara” (discussion) from the Prophet’s time, and well before English philosopher John Stuart Mill famously described democracy as “government by discussion”.By 2030, 60% of the world’s Muslims will continue to live in developing or least-developed economies and encounter problems wrought by unbridled capitalism, discrimination and neo-liberalism, rather than political subjugation. Fixing these problems will require mastery over modern economics and sciences, understanding of complex modern institutions such as the World Trade Organization and the United Nations.The Taliban has no idea about how to claim the $9 billion of foreign reserves held by Afghanistan, for instance, mostly in assets abroad. But they will need that money soon. They can’t blow up human beings to access those cash piles. Muslims make up about 22% of the world’s population. But over a third of the world’s two-billion poor people live in Muslim countries. The Quran enjoins Muslims to proactively work to change their fortunes. This, today, means assertion of claims through a language of rights, rather than violent extremism.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/talibans-rhetoric-indicates-the-limits-of-islamist-project-and-jihadism-101629713004190.html
23-08-2021||Today's||To ensure justice, a caste census is essential||An Indian women’s hockey team player, who happened to be Dalit, had to face caste slurs, and her family had to confront upper-caste harassment after the team’s loss in the Tokyo Olympics. This reminded me of novelist Farahat Zama’s apt comment, “You can take an Indian out of the caste system, but you cannot take the caste system out of an Indian.”The caste system is India’s nemesis and has severely restricted the country’s ability to realise its immense potential and become a great nation in science, technology, knowledge, art, sport and economic prosperity. Many public intellectuals would like to believe that they have been “de-casted” — meaning they have got rid of all of the markers of caste identity. But whether we acknowledge it or not, caste has been at the forefront of our social existence and regulates our lives — from birth to death, customs, rituals, housing, professions, development planning, and even voting preferences.Studies suggest that 94% of marriages are endogamous; 90% of menial jobs are performed by the deprived castes, whereas this figure is reversed in white-collar jobs. This abysmal lack of caste diversity, especially at the decision-making levels in various sectors — the media, the judiciary, higher education, bureaucracy or the corporate sector — is weakening these institutions and their performance.Also Read | Caste census and the vicious cycle of Mandal-Mandir politics in IndiaIt is indeed strange that while caste plays such a dominant role in our social, economic and political life, no credible and comprehensive caste data exists for more than half the population of our country.While census data has been captured for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, religions and linguistic profiles, there has been no profiling of all castes in India since 1931. Since then, caste has assumed an increasingly important position in our lives, and our reliance on inadequate data has also increased. A caste census, which will generate exhaustive data will allow policymakers to develop better policies, implementation strategies, and will also enable a more rational debate on sensitive issues.With every passing day and increasing social awareness, the urgency to do away with the caste system is being sharply felt. BR Ambedkar stated that if India had to attain a place of pride among the comity of nations, caste would have to be annihilated first. The 21st century is the right time to solve India’s caste question, which would otherwise extract a heavy price, not just sociologically, but also politically and economically, and make us fall behind in the development index.How can a nation live for eternity with innumerable social differentiation, divisions and graded inequalities, resulting in untouchability, mutual hate, separation, violence, lack of unity, illiteracy and poverty? Unequal distribution of wealth, resources and education has meant an acute shortage of purchasing power among the majority of Indians. As a democratic nation, we cannot forcibly overthrow the system, but we need to address it in a democratic, scientific and objective manner.It is intriguing that while no one seems to publicly oppose a caste census, it is still not happening. India needs to be bold and decisive in tackling caste questions through data and statistics in the way the United States (US) does to tackle race issues, by collecting data around race, class, language, inter-race marriages, among other metrics. This data provides a mirror to the State and society of the US in which they can see themselves and take decisions to do course corrections.Our Constitution too favours conducting a caste census. Article 340 mandates the appointment of a commission to investigate the conditions of socially and educationally backward classes and make recommendations as to the steps that should be taken by governments.The Sachar Committee Report recommended setting up a national data bank. The Justice Rohini committee was appointed in 2017 to look into the sub-categorisation of the OBC communities; however, in the absence of data, there can be no data-bank or any proper sub-categorisation. The apex court has time and again asked governments to provide the data related to castes; however, this has not been possible due to the non-availability of such data. As a result, our national life suffers from mutual mistrust and misconceptions among different castes. All such commissions have had to rely on data from the last caste census (1931).However, to reduce the whole rationale of caste census to its utility in the proper formulation of reservation and other social justice policies in favour of deprived sections of society would be doing injustice to the philosophy behind the caste census. Caste census is not merely an SC/ST/OBC question, it is above all a question of justice for all and national integration.The reluctance of the Government of India to have a caste census will certainly not help in addressing the issue. If India has to emerge as a confident and strong nation, it must shed its hesitancy and ostrich-like escapism in conducting a caste-linked socio-economic census. This will kick-start a process that will eventually take, to use the words of Farahat Zama, the caste system away from an Indian.Dr Chandan Yadav is national secretary, Indian National Congress The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/to-ensure-justice-a-caste-census-is-essential-101629712764442.html
23-08-2021||Today's||India’s health sector presents an opportunity to transition to clean energy||A recent report by India’s NITI Aayog discusses various operating models of India’s not-for-profit hospitals to highlight the crucial services they provide and the challenges they face. As the country recovers from another wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, India’s overstretched and inadequate health infrastructure, which largely remained in the margins of conversations on development, has taken centre stage in the past year. And the stark differences in the quality and cost of care between private healthcare facilities and the government and not-for-profit hospitals are very evident.Data from the annual national Rural Health Statistics (RHS) have long informed us of the challenges that the government faces in filling rural vacancies at Primary Health Centres (PHCs) or ensuring trained medical professionals remain in their jobs in remote parts of the country. What is often missed is how the not-for-profit health sector had stepped in to fill this gap. The NITI Aayog report acknowledges these services by this sector and highlights prominent challenges it faces.These challenges mirror those faced by the government hospitals — the severe lack of infrastructure and the constraints in expanding it, often exacerbated by insufficient funding. There is also the challenge of getting trained medical professionals to take up rural postings, leaving many jobs unfilled. This is an extremely important and timely report. We add one more challenge– the lack of reliable and affordable electricity required to power existing and future rural healthcare facilities.Challenges in recruitment and retention of healthcare staffThese gaps present a challenge, but they also provide an opportunity to attempt a paradigm shift in building health infrastructure and provisioning power supply. Both would directly impact the quality of care, its reach, and the livelihoods this would create.Also Read | Patnaik relaunches flagship healthcare scheme with enhanced cover for womenAccording to the RHS 2019-20, nearly a quarter of the 35,980 sanctioned positions for doctors in rural Primary Health Centres (PHCs) nationwide are unfilled. The statistics for Community Health Centres (CHCs) that provide specialised medical care are even starker. The data reveals that 63.3% of the sanctioned posts of specialists at CHCs are vacant. They comprise surgeons, obstetricians & gynaecologists, physicians and paediatricians.More importantly, of the existing about 155,000 sub-centres, nearly one-third (44,000) and 1,000 PHCs out of about 25,000 in rural areas still operate without electricity supply.Healthcare professionals point to multiple hardships, from low salaries to working in remote locations that lack basic facilities such as reliable electricity and water supply, motorable roads, and network connectivity. Often, rural healthcare facilities lack sophisticated diagnostic and surgical tools and medical equipment.Also, a common refrain is the limited infrastructure for their accommodation, the lack of options for good schools and daycare support for their children. Cumulatively, these issues deter medical staff from moving to these remote locations.Reliable and affordable energy is essential for the health sectorWhile more attention needs to be paid to some of these issues, the provision of reliable electricity is a low-hanging fruit.Reliable electricity is crucial for every aspect of a health facility. It is required to run equipment for diagnostics, sterilisation, medical procedures, water supply, and store vaccines and other medications. Beyond the hospital building, reliable electricity is required to power staff quarters — not just lights and fans, but also household and kitchen appliances, charging mobile phones and internet connectivity. The efficient functioning of a health facility is underpinned by the quality of infrastructure provided to its staff, which is only possible when there is affordable and reliable power supply for all their needs.Reliable access to energy, therefore, plays a critical role in creating a virtuous cycle. 24x7 power supply in hospitals enables upgradation of facilities to provide advanced healthcare services and for longer operating hours. This results in more patients being able to access much needed healthcare facilities, reinforcing the need for more doctors and nurses. In turn, this could possibly attract more financing for the health facility to improve its infrastructure.The NITI Aayog report also highlights lessons that could be learnt in management from the not-for-profit sector. In terms of infrastructure and equipment, not-for-profit hospitals rely on judicious use of funding for capital expenditure and focus on cost optimisation. They achieve this through greater focus on general ward beds than on private care, limited installation of ACs in the premises, and a greater emphasis on natural ventilation and daylighting wherever feasible.There is, however, a drawback, which is the use of medical equipment often extending beyond its lifespan and relying on second-hand parts. This might add a layer of inefficiency and consume more power than the state of the art equipment.Challenges to expanding infrastructureNot-for-profit hospitals are financially constrained, as most of them depend on government grants or donations to meet their capital expenditure, and at times, operating expenses as well. Any income is primarily used to fund operating expenses. This limits their ability to diversify and provide further services. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds are an avenue to explore further. However, funding for hospitals in remote regions is generally limited as companies prefer to spend in areas where they have their operations.Financing is a significant issue for both not-for-profit and government rural health facilities, and this needs to be addressed. In 2020-21, India spent 1.8% of its GDP on health, which is one of the lowest public health spends globally, and the lowest amongst the BRICS nations. The Economic Survey 2020-2021 stated how increasing public spending to 2.5% to 3% of the GDP could more than halve out-of-pocket expenses for patients from 65% to 30%.While the last budget did increase healthcare allocations, this was focused on Covid-19 care and vaccinations.Additionally, increased budgetary allocations towards enhancing access and quality of all health services are needed. This requires a holistic view of creating a climate-resilient and energy-efficient healthcare infrastructure. This could be achieved by assessing healthcare facility energy requirements, retrofitting energy-efficient medical equipment and ensuring the provisioning of power through cost-effective renewable energy resources.Transitioning to renewable energy comes with multiple benefits. They can be deployed quickly, and will immediately enhance the reliability of the power supply. It will also bring savings on power bills and cut down on diesel expenses required for standby generators. These accrued savings could be ploughed back into enhancing healthcare service delivery.Not-for-profit hospitals that WRI partners with have already successfully attempted this transition. They are now looking at expanding their services as they reap the benefits of less expensive and more reliable renewable energy.The NITI Aayog report has spotlighted a sector that has thousands of unsung warriors who have striven to put the care of others first, particularly in the least visible and remote regions of India. It is time to ensure lessons from this sector on resource management inspire the private and government healthcare facilities to attempt a sustainable transition to clean energy.Lanvin Concessao and Masfick Hazarika work on expanding energy access in rural and remote parts of India as part of the World Resources Institute, IndiaThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/indias-health-sector-presents-an-opportunity-to-transition-to-clean-energy-101629712404141.html
23-08-2021||Today's||The US misread Taliban once. Has it walked into Pakistan’s trap again?||Pakistan’s ruler, General Zia ul-Haq, and his Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Chief, Hamid Gul first conceived the idea of “Afghan Jihad” in the 1980s, and sold it to the United States (US) and Saudi Arabia as a means to bring down the Soviet Union.Zia told Selig Harrison in an interview, “We won’t permit Afghanistan to be like it was before, with Indian and Soviet influence there and claim on our territory. It will be a real Islamic state, part of a Pan-Islam revival, that will one day win over the Moslems in the Soviet Union, you will see.”America spent over $8 billion on the Afghan war, but Zia used the Afghan triumph to create an illusionary “strategic depth” for achieving the twin goals of a) undermining the growing Pashtunistan demand, and b) drawing the specter of Cold War closer to South Asia to engulf Kashmir. The project was carried out under the patronage of conservative Jamaat-i-Islami (JU). ISI spent 50% of the US and Saudi aid on Gubuddin Hekmatyar of Hizb-i-Islami and the remaining on other moderate “Peshawar Seven”.It helped Pakistan radicalise Afghanistan, and to divert the Mujahideen’s attention to Kashmir when it sent hordes of “Afghanis” to the Valley in the post-Soviet withdrawal.The roots of the Taliban But the Afghan project soon boomeranged on the US. ISI turned Afghanistan into a breeding ground for terrorists. By 1992-93, over 120 camps had sprung up in the Pakistan-Afghanistan frontier that trained 30,000 jihadis drawn from international Sunni terrorist network. Shockingly, US-supplied weapons, including Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, turned up in the hands of terrorists aiming to hit Western targets starting from 1991.Also Read | Taliban flags proliferate as Afghan tricolour becomes resistance symbolTed Galen Carpenter aptly wrote, “If that outcome is a US policy triumph, one shudders to contemplate what a policy failure would look like.....the United States was not merely a relatively passive accomplice in the destructive agendas pursued by Islamabad and Riyadh – it was an active collaborator in foisting an oppressive political system on the people of Afghanistan, the result of that policy is a damning enough indictment of American action.”The G7 Paris summit in 1996 finally called for hunting down the al Qaeda hideouts. But while rectifying its past follies, Washington once again walked into a Pakistani-laid trap. It blindly weighed on the ISI’s prepared Afghan blueprint for placing yet another monster, the Taliban militia which was to work towards disarming the Afghan jihadists, curb opium growth, reunite the country and drive out all foreign terrorists sheltered in Afghanistan.The Taliban had been created in 1992 by ISI after its old protégés Mujahideens, whom the ISI scrupulously nurtured, turned their back, and refused to kowtow before Islamabad, and instead turned to Delhi for support once they formed their government in Kabul in 1992.It was Benazir Bhutto and her Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar (Gul’s arch-rival) who sought to revamp the Afghan project by abandoning the entire Mujahideen networks in favour of creating a fresh militia — the Taliban. This time, the project was launched under the patronage of Jamaat-ul-Ulema-Islam (JUI) led by Maulana Fazlur Rahman.The US-Taliban dynamic The Western world was open to supporting the Taliban, so long as it helps stall Iran’s strategic advantage; oil and geopolitics after the Soviet collapse.The US quickly dispatched Senator Hank Brown and Assistant Secretary Robin Raphel rushing to meet with the Taliban leaders in 1995. Naseerullah Khan Babar took the US Ambassador in Islamabad on a tour to the Taliban bases. A clear-cut American incentive therefore enabled the Taliban’s surge of taking over one-third of Afghan territory within a few months.The Taliban push came against the Indian and Iranian financing of a strategic railway project to connect Central Asia for the first time with the Persian Gulf through Sarakh (Turkmenistan) with Tajan (Iran) - completed in 1994. The move quickly prompted the US to support a Pakistani sign a deal with the UNOCAL and Saudi Delta to build a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to Pakistan via Afghanistan as against Kabul’s decision to sign a deal with the Argentinean Company, Bridas. Zalmay Khalilzad, now the US special envoy for Afghanistan, then negotiated with the Taliban for UNOCAL.The US and Pakistan were also perturbed by India’s response to a power-sharing deal between the Rabbani regime and Hekmatyar in 1996. Not only did the Indian Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda send a congratulatory message to Hekmatyar on his assuming the post of Prime Minister but also invited him to Independence Day reception at the Embassy of India in Kabul on August 15, 1996 by India’s Charge d’ Affairs. Taliban captured Kabul on September 27, 1996.The US welcomed the first flush of the Taliban’s victory. The US spokesman Nicholas Burns admitted to Washington having contacts with the Taliban. The New York Times described the Taliban as a moderate force. Khalilzad advocated for rendering US assistance to the Taliban and argued that it was fundamentalist force but doesn’t practice Iranian-style anti-US policy. The Americans believed that the Afghan militia pursued “anti-modernism” rather than “anti-Western” policies. They were reviving “traditional Afghan society” rather than “exporting Islam”.But within a month of the Taliban victory, Washington had to withhold its decision to recognise the Taliban regime amid mounting international criticism against the militia’s appalling medieval-style savagery rule that put off the world community, including the orthodox Iranian clergy. In a U-turn, Assistant Secretary Robin Raphel declared, “US supports none of the warring factions.”But the damage was already done. Taliban’s brutality against the women had already caused huge embarrassment to the US. Despite the Taliban’s initial pledged, Mullah Omar rebuffed every US attempt to get Osama bin Laden out of Afghanistan for a trial even at the risk of being bombed out of power.Obviously, the Americans were made to look naïve as they were deluded into by Pakistan that the Taliban would be a good ally of the US. In fact, the ISI Commanders scrupulously worked on their own agenda of pocketing $2.5 billion sponsored for the Taliban operation.One has to read The Wars of Afghanistan: Messianic Terrorism, Tribal Conflicts, and the Failures of Great Powerswritten by Peter Tomsen, former US Ambassador to Afghanistan (1989-1992) that details how the Pakistanis played a duplicitous role in duping the Western world into believing that Pakistan was inclined towards a negotiated settlement, but in practice, they wanted to install their clients in Kabul.The motives in 2021So, what is the American latest deal with the Taliban and the urgency to withdraw troops from Afghanistan all about?It started with Donald Trump’s “America First” fixation, combined with the US strategic shift of focus from counterterrorism to containing China.President Joe Biden now vows to “fight the battles of the next 20 years, not the last 20”. Going strictly by this statement, this could well mean that the current US Afghan game may be about China – to use the assortment of Islamic forces as potent instruments vis a vis Xinjiang. Even the deeply worried Central Asians sense that the Taliban’s surge will not be confined to Afghanistan.Pakistan this time is running with the hare and hunting with the hounds. It is simultaneously trying to play the American, Chinese and Russian game with the sole aim of seizing a fresh opportunity to foment trouble in Kashmir.

23-08-2021||Today's||In Perspective: Taliban, tech and the fight for Afghanistan’s future||When the United States (US) and its allies launched the war in Afghanistan in 2001, internet was banned in the country. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube did not exist.Soon after US President George W Bush announced Operation Enduring Freedom with the news of the first airstrikes in Afghanistan on October 7 that year, the Taliban began their information operation via radio. The message stressed on the “invasion of the outsiders” and sought to rally unity in a country controlled by various tribes in different regions. The Western campaign fought back with a message not entirely different — the Taliban were collaborators of Osama Bin Laden, an Arab, and his group of foreign fighters.As the Western militaries pulled out in the last few months, the Taliban swept back across the country. Their resurgence, shocking as it was to strategists who failed to foresee its speed and scale, is backed by a robust propaganda machinery.The Taliban now run websites with political cartoons, host podcast-like internet radio channels, and cultivate a network of WhatsApp groups that are hard to detect. Publicly, its representatives on Twitter take care to steer clear of the company’s rules against hate content to quietly gather more followers.To borrow a now ubiquitous business process jargon, Taliban’s digital transformation holds the key to understanding how it gained strength while out of power and what it could indicate about the future that awaits Afghanistan.The early days of the narrative warTo understand the evolution of the information warfare in Afghanistan, it is important to look at the information itself – or at least the core of it. In 2001, the Taliban painted the US and its allies as foreign invaders.The focus of the western narrative was not far removed: According to a Brookings research paper from 2001, the US and its allies too sought to leverage sentiments of nationalism. They recast the Taliban as a collaborator of Osama Bin Laden, an Arab whose group of foreign fighters were bringing misery to the country, laying the foundation for support for a civilian government.Taliban’s embracing of techIn his 2018 book, Taliban Narratives, conflict researcher Thomas H Johnson unpacks the message and the method that lay at the heart of the Taliban’s information operation. In it, he charts the evolution from night letters (these would be delivered to villages overnight to be read out at the town square), to DVDs. As the internet revolution took place, the Taliban launched their website, Alemarah in 2005.Also Read | Indian evacuation from Kabul on verge of completion, 2 more flights today“Wars today cannot be won without media. Media aims at the heart rather than the body, [and] if the heart is defeated, the battle is won.” In December 2010, Alemarah’s editor Abdul Satar Maiwandi gave this quote as part of an interview, Johnson writes, noting it as the first time the Taliban revealed the extent of their information operations. For a group that had banned the internet when it controlled Afghanistan, it now set out to leverage email, texting, tweets, blogs, YouTube, and Facebook, Maiwandi indicated.How has this played out?Johnson writes digital technologies have improved the speed of Taliban’s messaging. Among the examples he cites are posts on news, battle reports, interviews, commentaries, and even video clips of rocket attacks on Western forces being hosted on the websites. One of the websites also had a significant portion of warrior poetry. This, Johnson says, is evidence that the Taliban and other militants were utilising and exploiting cultural norms.But cultural norms have been only one part of the sentiments being exploited. The other is fear.Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) researchers Atlantic Council’s DFR Labs found evidence in 2019 of a Taliban influence operation on Twitter amplifying the group’s voter intimidation tactics. At least 67 Taliban-associated accounts pushed hashtags that highlighted Taliban’s attacks, electoral disruptions and murders, the assessment found. The campaign, the researchers added, also served to further questions on the civilian government’s legitimacy.Taliban is in power. Why does it need these narratives now?Two facets of Taliban’s recent information strategies provide some clues.The first of this is a more recent influence operation on Twitter that unfolded as the insurgents rapidly captured cities. Taliban’s spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid tweeted out these advances, portraying them as the group’s strategic superiority. Victories were broadcast widely, helping propagate a sense of invincibility that may or may not have played a role when Afghan forces abandoned their posts areas that fell later. The messages were amplified by bot-like behaviour and copy-paste posts. This campaign peaked on August 15, when Taliban entered Kabul.Also Watch | Does Joe Biden trust the Taliban? US President replies to reporterThe second relates to what happened after Kabul fell. The messages and posts attempted to paint a more positive picture. They attempted to show that the group enforced rule of law, and carried messages of reassurances for women and ethnic minorities.These suggest that similar to the ways in which other authoritarian or oppressive regimes have used information operations, the Taliban recognise the control of the message on social media is crucial for its overall control of the narrative.How does this pose a threat?Oppressive regimes have typically attempted to reduce the amount of opportunity social media gives to the challengers of the status quo while leveraging it to further their control. Iran and North Korea ban social media entirely, while China allows only those that it has complete control over. In places without a strict ban or with less sophisticated network controls, social media has been leveraged for active harm and disinformation – such as its use in Myanmar to further anti-Rohingya sentiment.At present, Afghanistan does not have the capacity – human or technical – to impose the level of strict network filtering to create a China-like digital walled garden.It is an unknown whether Taliban will plunge the country into a digital blackout, although the likelihood is low due to the potential disruption in business, and the backlash it may stoke.For now, the biggest threats from Taliban’s embracing of technology stem from its ability to set narratives that could mask the reality of its rule.Particularly at risk is also a generation of people who grew up on the internet, leaving behind digital footprints that Taliban is likely to find at odds with its strict interpretation of Islamic law. One instance that captured such fears last week was when Khalida Popal, the face of Afghan women’s football team, urged players to burn their jerseys and take down photos of matches.In Perspective takes a deep dive into current issues, the visible and invisible factors at play, and their implications for our future.

23-08-2021||Editorials||A national consensus on Afghanistan||On Monday, external affairs minister S Jaishankar tweeted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked that all floor leaders in Parliament be briefed on developments in Afghanistan. After a Parliament session marked by a breakdown in ties between the government and the Opposition, this is a laudable step. Events in Afghanistan represent a serious national security threat for India, and it is only right that the government shares information and its policy framework with India’s political class. After hearing Opposition leaders and their views, there must be a national consensus on the Afghanistan policy.This is even more important because the rise of the Taliban threatens to become an issue in India’s domestic politics. Simply put, it is a threat. India must do all it can to secure its citizens as well as interests and investment in that country over the past two decades; it must lay down its redlines for a future Taliban government; it must continue to ideologically battle the Taliban; and it must gear up to prevent any terror attacks.Also Read | In Perspective: Taliban, tech and the fight for Afghanistan’s futureThe experience of the early 1990s, when jihadi fighters moved to Kashmir from Afghanistan, is all too fresh. There are indications that Jaish founder and terrorist Masood Azhar has already visited Kandahar to meet with the victorious Taliban leadership.But while dealing with the threat, and cracking down on religious extremism, it is important that the Taliban’s success is not used to demonise Indian Muslims — who have nothing to do with its fanatical brand of Islam and terror machinery. Its rise must not be used to create an environment of fear. Cross-party consultations and resisting the temptation to deepen polarisation can help prevent this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-national-consensus-on-afghanistan-101629715826107.html
23-08-2021||Editorials||The idea of social justice||A new caste census will change India’s political landscape, inter-community equations, reservations policy, welfare architecture, and electoral outcomes. It is now the common demand of the entire non-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) political spectrum — Nitish Kumar and Tejashwi Yadav’s meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday was a stark reflection of the power of this demand. The idea of the caste census, the political jostling around it, the mechanics of the census, and eventually, its outcome will shape the course of Indian politics. This newspaper believes that a caste-based count of India’s population has a troubling premise and potentially disturbing consequences — but it is inevitable now.Also Read | Caste census and the vicious cycle of Mandal-Mandir politics in IndiaThe BJP has a substantial OBC base, which it hopes to cement further with the sub-categorisation of OBCs. Its rivals believe that a caste census, which throws up the real scale of India’s backward population, can be a precursor to breaching the 50% reservation cap — this, in turn, can upset the BJP’s social alliance. But the core question is what constitutes the collective imagination of India and what defines social justice? Is India a conglomeration of communities, each of which deserves exactly proportionate representation in public life according to their demographic strength? Or is India a republic of individual citizens, each of whom must have fundamental rights, access to equitable opportunities, and the choice to rise above their narrower group-based identities?There is no doubt that caste remains a key determinant of political choice, socioeconomic status, and access to opportunities. There can also be little doubt that designing policies or even conducting politics based on a 1931 census is irrational. Indeed, if a one-time caste census was used to redesign welfare policies and focus on substantive steps to tackle inequality, it would even be desirable. But the caste census, according to the Opposition’s chronology, is a prelude to enhanced reservations — from being a tool to address historic injustice to becoming a tool for employment generation, power-sharing, and addressing manufactured grievances, the original rationale of India’s reservations is already lost. The census will also deepen political competition where group identities — both caste, and to circumvent caste, religion — prevail over individual rights. It is to sign up for an imagination of India where the individual is seen as little else but a member of his caste. It is to ignore the real questions such as shrinking opportunities, across castes. And it is to invite social unrest. There must be better ways to ensure justice, provide equity, and democratise power than reinforcing, rather than annihilating, caste.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-idea-of-social-justice-101629714324462.html
