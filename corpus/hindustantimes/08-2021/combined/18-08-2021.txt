Asthana who took charge as Delhi police commissioner last month said that such persons should be identified and dealt with as per the law. The newly appointed Delhi police chief made the comments at the Shyam Lal College in Shahdara during a community-based policing function. During the programme, the top cop told citizens that though police were trained to tackle all law-and-order issues, they could be more effective with support of the citizens.“Being an important link in information regarding criminal activities, arrest of criminals or management of law-and-order issues, public cooperation is the sine qua non. Since it is not feasible to deploy policepersons in every nook and corner, a self-disciplined and service-oriented society is required to assist the police to establish peace and harmony. Crime has no religion and only a few anti-social elements spoil the social environment. Such unscrupulous elements need to be identified and dealt with as per law”, he saidIn February 2020, many parts of north-east Delhi had witnessed clashes between Hindus and Muslims in what was one of the worst riots in Delhi in the last three decades. At least 53 persons died while 600 others were injured. Among those who died was Delhi police head constable Ratan Lal. On Wednesday, Asthana also instituted “Ratan Lal Medal of hope.” Lal’s wife was also felicitated at the event. On the 2020 Delhi riots, Asthana told reporters, “ I was not in Delhi Police when the riots took place. But being a police officer, it was very sad for me to hear about it. I was regrettable that this kind of problem arose in a city like Delhi, where people had almost forgotten riots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/crime-has-no-religion-delhi-police-commissioner-101629311319488.html
18-08-2021||Pune||Sextortion cases on the rise in Pune||The cases of cheating people into indulging in virtual sex and recording them to extort money from them have seen a spike during the second year of Covid-19 restrictions.The number of extortion cases using nude pictures till the end of July 2021, was 134. By August 17, the number of those cases had reached 171, according to the cybercrime cell officials.The cases started rising at a rate that made the Pune city police cybercrime cell officials form a separate section in the data records of the cell.The total number of cybercrime cases has gone up in the past few years with 7,795 in 2019, 14,950 in 2020 and over 11,000 so far in 2021. With that, the number of cases in all three major categories and 65 sub-categories has gone up.“There is not even a single female victim in any of these recorded cases. They are all men. And the amounts extorted from them are in the bracket of ₹2,000-5,000 or a few more,” said senior police inspector Dagdu Hake of Cyber police station of Pune city police.“We have detected a few such cases and found the culprits to be from Rajasthan and the northern belt. While the investigation into these cases is underway, we have not found any links to suspects in Maharashtra,” he said.“These cases started getting more frequent in the lockdown period. But we were recording them in social media frauds. But in 2021, the frequency increased to a point where we had to make a separate sub-section,” said another official of the cell who did not wish to be named.“The modus operandi used to trap people in such cases, as observed by the police, is like any social media fraud - the accused befriend the victim on the social media platform, they start a conversation and exchange phone numbers and after weeks or months of talking, they ask for virtual sex which is recorded without the victim’s knowledge in most cases,” according to Hake.“So far the amounts are small. They say that they now know the relatives on the victims’ social media accounts and will send the video to these relatives to threaten the victims. Our advice is always to stop paying money as it emboldens them,” he said.Helpline numbersThe cybercrime cell has launched emergency helplines which are active at all hours and are also available on WhatsApp - 7058719371 and 7058719375. The police have urged people to report any cybercrime cases at the earliest in order to ease the detection process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sextortion-cases-on-the-rise-in-pune-101629311260646.html

The price of dry fruit imported from Afghanistan has gone up by 30 to 50% within a fortnight, traders said.“The rates of almonds have almost doubled in the last 20 days. Pistachio and raisin prices have also gone up by around 30%. The prices of dates are also increasing every day,” informed Rohit Ahuja, partner in a major wholesale store in Fatehganj, Lucknow.Reportedly dry fruits and raisins worth 20 crore are imported every year in the state capital from Afghanistan. The produce is imported by firms in New Delhi and Maharashtra from where it is bought by local traders.Currently, the price of a 1 kg of almonds in Lucknow has gone up to ₹1,050 from ₹600, pistachio prices have gone up to ₹2,100 a kg from ₹1,700 a kg, while the prices of raisins have risen to ₹800 a kg from ₹600 a few weeks ago. The spike in prices has led to a decline in demand in the last few days. “Shopkeepers who used to buy a kg of almonds from our shop every week, are not buying more than 250 grams now,” Ahuja said.“The rise in prices of dry fruit will force the middle class to remove dry fruit from our kitchen. It is becoming difficult to manage the budget due to inflation and fewer earnings. How can we afford expensive dry fruit,” said Snehlata Singh, a homemaker in Gomti Nagar extension.Besides home kitchens, sweet shops too are major consumers of dry fruit. “We are already under strain due to the rise in prices of ingredients. Now the increase in prices of dry fruit will make it more difficult for us to maintain quality of products without increasing rates,” said Vineet Gupta, owner of a nearly 200-year-old sweet shop in the Old City area.Dry fruit traders fear that delay in Afghanistan returning to normalcy may further bump up the prices of dry fruit in the coming days. “The consumption of dry fruit goes up after the monsoon and during winter. If the condition in Afghanistan doesn’t improve by then, the rates of dry fruit will increase further,” said Suresh Dhiman, another dry fruit trader of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-sees-spike-in-dry-fruit-prices-as-taliban-take-over-afghanistan-101629310959965.html

The school administrations have been asked to reach out to parents and encourage them to send their children back to school for physical classes. But it has been made essential to take parents’ consent, according to detailed guidelines issued by Anamika Singh, director general, school education. “Due to prolonged closure of physical classes, there is a possibility that students’ capacity may have declined. The schools were asked to simultaneously run remedial classes for students who were not able to keep pace with online classes,” said the guidelines. The school administrations have been asked to constitute Nigrani Samitis that will ensure that the Covid -9 protocol is in place, suggesting that seating arrangements for students should be made in a way that a gap of 6 feet is maintained between two students. The government has also said that schools with a large number of students must operate in two shifts. The shifts are to be of three hours’ duration from 8 am to 11 am and 11.30 am to 2.30 pm. The school administrations have been asked to ensure that all common places accessed by staff and students are sanitized regularly. The school managements are required to educate students about Covid guidelines and discourage them from sharing their food and other belongings. Schools will run both online and offline classes so that students who do not wish to come to school may continue with their studies. Schools for students of classes 6 to 8 would now open from August 23 instead of September 1. Classroom teaching for classes 1 to 5 will begin from September 1. A government press release said the chief minister instructed officials to begin preparations for the reopening of schools for students of classes 6 to 8 in view of the controlled situation of Covid in the state. On August 2, the state government announced that secondary schools in UP (for classes 9 to 12) would resume physical classes from August 16, with 50% attendance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sops-issued-for-reopening-of-schools-for-classes-68-101629310600666.html

18-08-2021||Gurugram||Surveillance cameras upgraded to detect traffic violations||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has upgraded cameras installed at 28 points to simultaneously help with surveillance and traffic management, as part of its Safe City project.Officials said that full-surveillance cameras have been installed at 28 points that can record proceedings as well as read the number plates of vehicles involved in traffic offences. These cameras also facilitate automated issuance of e-challans to violators, as the system is connected with the database of the National Informatics Centre (NIC). “Earlier, we had installed general surveillance cameras in the city for public safety, but we upgraded cameras at a few sites to full-surveillance ones, especially at busy crossings or places with heavy footfall. At the full surveillance sites, the cameras can read the number plates of the vehicles and initiate e-challans for violators. As the system is integrated with the database of NIC, challans are sent directly to offenders, be it a resident of Gurugram or other states,” a senior official with the GMDA’s Smart City division said. Of the 28 cameras, nine full-surveillance cameras have been installed at Bakhtawar Chowk, four at Wazirabad four-way intersection, eight at Rezang La Chowk, three at ATI Chowk near Sector 54 Rapid Metro and four at the Galleria Market intersection. These cameras have additional features, including automatic number plate recognition and red-light violation detection. The process of installing these cameras started early this year and 13 such cameras were installed till March. However, work stalled due to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Officials said that e-challans were issued from April 9, but the exact number issued till date was not available.Officials said that the full-surveillance cameras can also help locate stolen vehicles as specific numbers uploaded to the system will be detected by these cameras and officials alerted. Officials said that these cameras are also monitored by police officials at the integrated command and control centre regularly. After monitoring these sites for the next few months, the GMDA is likely to increase the number of full-surveillance cameras. However, a timeline has not been set. Under the Safe City project, the GMDA has already installed 1,100 live-feed CCTV cameras in the city. Another 100 cameras will be installed by the end of this month, officials said. The authority is also in the process of installing facial recognition cameras at 10 locations to track criminals and improve public safety. Two such cameras have already been installed at Sheetla Mata Mandir and the City Bus Stand. A tentative list of places for the installation of facial recognition cameras includes three metro stations, the railway station, bus stand and a government hospital, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/surveillance-cameras-upgraded-to-detect-traffic-violations-101629310121395.html

18-08-2021||Lucknow||2 UP teachers make it to 2021 national honours’ list||Two teachers from Uttar Pradesh have been selected for the National Awards for Teachers, 2021, in the list of 44 teachers nation-wide. They are: Manish Kumar of Junior High School, Shivganj, block Sahar, Auraiya and Tripti Mahaur, Government Girls Inter College Chamruya, Sadar, Rampur.Manish Kumar, 32, is the only government school teacher of Basic Shiksha Parishad, who has been selected for the award. Manish said that this award is just the start of the long journey he has to make in shaping the lives of thousands of children.To promote scientific temper among students and to make classroom teaching lively, Manish – a state teacher awardee in 2018 – claims that he developed a science lab, called ILA (informal lab activity with informal lab apparatus) where he encourages students to learn from kabaar se jugaar (trash to treasure). Currently, he is developing a science park to teach students the comparative size of planets (the solar system) when students return to school from August 23.Manish considers noted educator and retired IIT-Kanpur professor Padamshri HC Verma as his guru and role model. He is in touch with Verma for almost eight years and has attended four national workshops of Utsahi Physics Teachers (NWUPT) conducted by Verma.According to Manish, a government school teacher must stop cribbing about lack of resources. There are a number of government school teachers who generated resources without government funding and transformed their institution.“My role model, Prof HC Verma, says a teacher must first fall in love with the subject he or she teaches before expecting students to do the same. Schools are not the place to just score marks. They are the place to empower minds and improve capabilities. The target of education cannot be and should not be to clear board exams or IIT/NEET entrance.”Manish is a science graduate but he teaches all subjects at the junior high school level. He joined this school in Auraiya as an assistant teacher in September 2016. “There were just 64 children enrolled in the school then. Now, the student strength has increased to 107. There are three teachers in the school,” he said.The purpose of National Awards for Teachers is to celebrate the unique contribution of some of the finest teachers in the country and to honour those teachers who have not only improved the quality of school education but also enriched the lives of their students, through their commitment and industriousness.Tripti Mahaur expressed happiness over her selection for the national award saying that it is a recognition of her efforts that will continue to motivate her throughout her career. Tripti Mahaur has been teaching history and social science at the Government Girls Inter College in Kila Rampur for the last nine years. The teacher is popular among the students of the school for her unique teaching methods. Rampur district magistrate Ravinder Kumar Mandel called Tripti and congratulated her for the honour.Congratulating both teachers, Lalita Pradeep, director, additional basic education, said, “I am really proud of Tripti from secondary and Manish from the basic education sector for winning the National Award for Teachers this year. The state is proud of their extraordinary achievement in individual capacity. They are our heroes and will inspire a generation towards excellence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/2-up-teachers-make-it-to-2021-national-honours-list-101629310059892.html

We were facing difficulties with the application.

The BJP knows it is going to be defeated in MCD elections, so it wants to fill its pocket by selling off public properties through MCD. People of Delhi want that an honest government, like the Kejriwal government, be brought into the MCD,” said the AAP’s national secretary Pankaj Gupta. BJP’s Delhi spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the north MCD has got the lease sale of Novelty Cinema done by an open tender.Going by the commercial circle rate, the plot is worth ₹19.50 crore. The plot has been leased at ₹35 crore, almost double the circle rate, said Kapoor. “Before levelling baseless charges, AAP leaders should know that authorised construction will be done on a large part of this plot that will have hardly 225% floor area ratio (FAR), unlike small plots around it where up to 300 to 350% FAR is allowed,” said the BJP spokesperson. “If the AAP government feels that the plot is being sold below the market price, then it should come forward and help the cash-starved north MCD by buying the plot at their self-claimed market value,” said Kapoor. While the AAP is in charge of the Delhi government, the BJP rules the three municipal corporations in the Capital. Delhi goes to the municipal polls next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-protests-outside-bjp-headquarters-over-alleged-corruption-in-cinema-land-deal-101629309939363.html

There are 35 girls being trained in gymnastics, kabaddi and basketball, while 40 boys are being trained in gymnastics and table tennis. They were residing in three hostels for girls and two hostels for boys,” said Ram Milan, the deputy sports officer at the stadium. “With the outbreak of the pandemic early in Agra, these boys and girls had to leave the hostel and return to their hometowns, as they mostly came from eastern Uttar Pradesh, including districts of Varanasi, Azamgarh, Mau, Prayagraj, etc.” stated Ram Milan. These sports persons are chosen after a tough competition at the district, then regional and then state level. They undergo a 15-day central coaching camp and after physical and skill training, merit is prepared and hostels are allocated to them. To continue to be at a hostel to avail training, these boys and girls have to participate in national level games within 3 years and in junior level national within 5 years. They are below 12 years when admitted in hostels and are trained for particular sports while continuing their studies. There are many schools who wish to have these sports-oriented students as they bring laurels to the institution. The fee for these students is paid by the government which also bears their expenses when they travel to participate in tournaments. “These boys and girls have missed their training since the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020 and had returned for some time before the second wave in April 2021 struck. As such, there has been a long break for these boys and girls,” said Ram Milan, but could offer little as a solution. “There are private sports academies in Prayagraj with whom our boys and girls often have competitions. These private academies in Prayagraj have re-opened but we await a go-ahead from the authorities. I fear our students will lag behind,” the deputy sports officer said. “We could not arrange for the girls but we arranged residence for 12 out of 15 boys and kept them in the city area so that they can attend training for gymnastics at Eklavya Sports stadium. However, families of these boys have to bear the expenses which come to roughly to ₹3,000 a month for a boy including charges for their lodging, food etc,” said Ram Milan. However, most parents find it tough to bear such expenditure because of financial constraints in these testing times. The sports authorities admit that financial constraints do matter and ultimately, the solution lies in having these young players in the hostel but precautions during these pandemic times too are unavoidable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-pandemic-closed-sports-hostels-leave-trainees-in-the-lurch-101629309640209.html

18-08-2021||Noida||Greater Noida: Action against illegal hoardings after complaint||The Greater Noida authority acted against the illegal hoardings or unipoles in a drive that started on Tuesday night and went on till 4am on Wednesday. The move comes after the authority on Tuesday received a complaint of illegal advertisements mushrooming in the city. The complainant mentioned that the authority removes the illegal unipoles, but sometime later realtors and other firms reinstall these unipoles without any permission, said officials from the authority. The Greater Noida authority’s chief executive officer, Narendra Bhooshan, directed the officials to take prompt action against this illegal activity. According to the officials, the complainant also said that unipoles removed earlier are being stored in sectors 1, 2, 3 and Kisan Chowk in Greater Noida West. The authority last week removed several unipoles from main roads in Greater Noida West. “We reached the spot and seized the iron poles, frames and other material lying at Kisan Chowk and other places. We have removed and seized 31 unipoles, which were installed without permission. We have cut down iron pillars into small pieces so that they cannot be reused,” said KR Verma, deputy general manager, Greater Noida authority.“We will sell the seized items in an auction to send across a message that illegal activity will be contained and stern action will be initiated,” said Verma.Residents have demanded tough action against illegal hoardings and unipoles.“In installing an illegal unipole, no safety precautions pertaining to its foundation and height are followed. As a result, in case of heavy wind they fall off often injuring commuters or pedestrians on city roads. We hope the authority will not allow any such illegal activity in the city,” said Vivek Raman, a resident of Gaur City.On Monday, the authority issued recovery notices against 70 firms that put up unipoles without permission since April 2018.“We will also impose penalty against those, whose unipoles have been seized in the last night drive,” said Verma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-action-against-illegal-hoardings-after-complaint-101629309099256.html

The chain of registration of cases, proper investigation and prosecution in court will worked on priority,” said SSP Kumar. “Any system cannot run in isolation and needs support and help from citizens.

18-08-2021||Noida||Residents’ body demands compensation for dog bites in Noida||Noida: Angry and scared over stray dog bites, a residents’ body has demanded compensation from the Noida authority alleging that it “failed to take care of city’s stray”.The stray dog menace is one of the major issues in the city. Rules prevent them from being relocated except temporarily in case of medical treatment, including sterilisation. Authority officials say they have “no data” on the number of incidents of dog bites, the residents’ body has estimated it at over 300 a month.“We are afraid to take a stroll on the roads and even in parks these days. Children, older citizens, cyclists, all have been at some point or the other chased or have suffered a bite from a stray animal. Yesterday, a little girl was bitten near our society. This cannot go on. Our patience is wearing thin. Since the authority is unable to control this menace, we demand that it pay ₹10,000 to every victim of a dog bite and offer treatment at a hospital of its choice. We will write to the authority demanding the same,” said Rajiva Singh, president of the Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Associations (NOFAA).He said that while officials claim that neutering or sterilising a stray dog is the only solution , “the same is not systematic”.“The authority has no survey or data on numbers of street dogs in the city or a particular area or the incidents of bites. How would they conduct a systematic or organised sterilisation or neutering. To our knowledge, almost 300 dog bites take place every month,” Singh said.“This is one of the major issues of the city as on daily basis we see or hear of a dog bite incident. Yesterday, a vegetable vendor was bitten by a street dog outside our high-rise. It should be dealt with on an urgent basis,” said Amit Gupta, a social activist and resident of Sector 77.According to the officials, their sterilisation programme will resume soon.“The sterilisation was stopped in March as a contract we had with a private agency expired. We have issued a fresh tender and the process will be completed in a few days. The aim will be to sterilise 1,500 dogs a month. We understand that this is the only way forward to control the problem,” said SC Mishra, project engineer (health), Noida authority,He said the programme had sterilised over 30,000 dogs in the past two years.“Both male and female dogs are sterilised so that they can’t reproduce. For this the operations are held at our Animal centre at sector 94. Over 30,000 dogs has been sterilised so far since 2019,” Mishra added.According to people engaged in animal welfare, some bites are “inevitable” and often due to “aggression towards the animal”.“An aggressive dog can be dealt with through proper training and treatment,” said Sanjay Mahapatra, founder of house of stray animal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/residents-body-demands-compensation-for-dog-bites-in-noida-101629308619798.html

The bodies were found about two kilometres from their home in Hoshiyarpur village under the Sector 49 police station limits, police said. The deceased were identified as Monu and Tinka. According to police, the boys’ mother, Varsha, on Wednesday morning had filed a missing complaint about her two sons and husband Mahesh at Sector 49 police station. Police said that local people informed them about the bodies of two children lying in the green belt near a private school. Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Noida, said a police team reached the spot. “The two children had injury marks on their bodies and throats. It appears they were attacked by a sharp object,” he said.The Sector 24 police launched an investigation and soon it was found that a missing complaint was lodged in this regard.According to Vinod Kumar Singh, station house officer (SHO) of Sector 49 police station, the woman in her complaint said that her husband Mahesh had taken their two children for evening walk on Tuesday in the park, but they did not return late night. The woman launched a search but failed to trace them, police said, adding that she filed a complaint on Wednesday morning. The woman has identified the children’s bodies, police said.Singh said that Mahesh, who worked at an embroidery workshop in the city, had lost his job last month. “He had been tense since then. He also had a heated argument with his wife over job loss last week. It appears he killed the two children and fled the spot,” the SHO said.However, the Noida DCP said that a police team visited the victims’ house and scanned the footage of CCTV cameras from nearby areas. “In the CCTV footage, Mahesh was seen going with the children at 6.30pm. Since Mahesh is missing, it is not clear if he is a victim or a suspect in this case. We are trying to trace him,” he said.Police said the two bodies have been sent for a post-mortem and reports are awaited. A case has been registered against unknown persons under Section 302 (murder) of IPC at Sector 24 police station. “We are investigating the case from all angles,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/minor-brothers-found-dead-in-noida-father-missing-101629308559151.html

Little girls are worshiped in our country, but cases of pedophilia are increasing. Sexual assault is a heinous crime. The victim suffers from psychological effects of embarrassment, disgust, depression, guilt and even suicidal tendencies. Many cases go unreported. In almost all such cases, the victim is unwilling to report the name of the abuser. Families of the victim remain silent about the sexual offences in order to protect the family image.”As per prosecution’s case, the applicant sexually assaulted the 13-year-old girl when she was alone in the house doing some household work and all her family members had gone to the agricultural field.The applicant allegedly took advantage of the situation, forcibly entered the house of the informant, and threatening to kill the victim, dragged her inside the room by grabbing her hair, and forcibly committed the crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/india-worships-little-girls-but-pedophilia-cases-on-the-rise-hc-101629305441172.html

Fifteen applications are still under scrutiny.This is because applicants did not provide a mandatory “fit for vaccination” certificate and/or a medical certificate declaring them as bed-ridden. The PMC had put out a special email ID inviting beneficiaries unable to go to vaccination centres due to their physical condition, to avail of the “vaccine on wheels” initiative; where in a mobile vaccine unit would drive to the home of the beneficiary to ensure the vaccination happened.Dr Surykant Deokar, PMC’s immunisation officer said, “Two weeks ago we rolled out this initiative, wherein citizens were to send their requests for immunisation on via email. We received 65 applications, of which 50 have been rejected. These applications lack the mandatory medical certificate issued by a doctor stating that the patient has been bed ridden due to some physical condition and is not able to go to the nearby Covid-19 vaccination centre. Also that the beneficiary is fit enough to receive the Covid immunisation. Some of the applications also lacked consent forms, mandatory to be submitted by family of bedridden citizens.All bed-ridden beneficiaries get only Covaxin as per central government guidelines, added Deokar. Dr Deokar said, “We are waiting to get enough applications so that we can plan the drive accordingly. If we have 15 beneficiaries as of now and if one of them lives in Hadapsar and the other on Sinhgad road or Baner, then it would take at least one hour to reach both places. In addition we would have to keep a watch on the beneficiary for at least for 20 minutes post vaccination. These are practical concerns and so we have to plan this special drive carefully.”City continues to face shortage of Covishield and Covaxin On Thursday, too, the civic body will keep its Covid-19 vaccination centres shut for a second day in a row due to a shortage of vaccines. On Wednesday centres were shut. Dr Deokar said that if the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) gets new stock on Thursday, then there would be a vaccination drive on Friday. Meanwhile, at a state-level video conference on Wednesday, the health department directed health officials at the taluka and corporation level to prioritise the second dose for beneficiaries. Also, a refund for private vaccination centres who have not received their vaccine stock despite payment was discussed.Vaccines for bedriddenApplicants can send their application along with mandatory documents to bedriddenvaccination.pune@gmail.com along with the beneficiary’s name, address, contact number, reasons for being bedridden, a doctor’s certificate and a consent letter from a family member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/50-applications-for-vax-for-bedridden-rejected-by-pmc-docus-not-in-order-101629305258837.html

The roads are located in Baner and Lohegaon, while the flyover is in Bibwewadi.The proposal, present in the standing committee’s budget plan, forecasts the cost of the project to be ₹500 crore.Amar Shinde, executive engineer of the road department, said, “We have decided to appoint a consultant who will give us a clear idea of the cost and other technical details. At present, we are working on five roads and one flyover.”He added, “One new road is located in Lohegaon and the other four are in Baner. The width of the roads varies from 14mts to 65mts. The flyover proposed in the Bibwewadi area will pass through Gangadham chowk. It is around one kilometre in length and will solve the traffic problem at Gangadham chowk.”Overall, as per Shinde, the road department has planned eight roads in its development plan (DP). The estimated cost of the eight roads is ₹123 crore. “We have also included one riverside road which connects Bund Garden road to the Mundhwa bridge. The road department has calculated the estimated cost of this bridge to be ₹27 crore,” he added. Under the PPP model, instead of PMC, private players such as contractor/builder/developer will spend the money and the PMC will issue credit notes which the private players can use for future construction activities, such as payment of development charges, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punes-infra-plans-5-new-cement-concrete-roads-one-flyover-101629305138824.html

The civic body reported 79 cases of the H1N1 (swine flu) virus as of August 18, 2021. Last year the city recorded 10 cases of swine flu, which may have been due to the Covid-19 pandemic affecting the reportage of H1N1 cases.In 2009, when the city saw its first death due to the infection, Pune reported a total of 144 swine flu deaths that year, the highest in the country at the time. As per PMC data, a total of 306 people were screened after reporting symptoms, which are similar to flu and Covid-19. A total of 287 people were given Tamiflu and their swab samples were sent for testing. Of these, 79 were positive. None are active cases or admitted to hospital. No death due to the infection has been reported. Dr Sanjeev Wavare, PMC assistant health officer and in-charge of the PMC’s monsoon-related disease department, said, “Last year when the Covid-19 pandemic struck we could report only 10 cases in March and after that, the city did not report any swine flu cases. This was because the entire health machinery was involved in Covid-19 management and surveillance.”Dr Wavare added: “The same efforts taken for Covid-19 can be applied to control swine flu as well and we are doing the same.” The swine flu infection, primarily found in pigs, has symptoms that include fever, lethargy, sneezing, coughing, difficulty in breathing and a decreased appetite.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-reports-79-cases-of-swine-flu-in-city-from-jan-to-aug-101629305078798.html

Speaking about the admissions to the first year of the undergrad programmes, Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal, Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce, Shivajinagar, said that the students from rural areas are not opting for colleges in the city due to Covid.Modern College has released its first merit list for all three undergraduate courses – Science, Arts and Commerce. For first year BSc, Modern College saw a cut-off of 85.16 per cent; for BCom it was 95 per cent and for BA it was 90.98 per cent. “For commerce, the cut-off this year is higher than previous year, but for Science and Arts the cut-offs are not much higher than 2020. Due to Covid, many students are hesitant to choose colleges from the city. Finding a safe place to stay is a big challenge for rural students. As a result, cut-offs have been affected,” said Zunjarrao. Savita Datar, principal, Sir Parshurambhau (SP) College, said that her admissions are based on the merit list for undergraduate courses. “We were expected to release the first merit list on August 18, however, as there are more applications still coming in, we will release the list in the coming days. Students may opt for Engineering courses instead of Science, which has been a constant trend. However, this year due to Covid, many students may choose a college closer to home. The cut-offs of course are likely to be higher than previous years as the competition for the same remains,” said Datar. She added that students who have scored between 65 per cent and 80 per cent in their Class 12 assessments may have to struggle a bit to get admissions this year. At SP College, cut-off for Commerce in 2020 was 88.92 per cent. Whereas, for BSc it was 82 per cent and for Arts it was 91 per cent. At Garware College of Commerce, the cut-off this year is likely to go up by two to three per cent. Anand Lele, vice-principal at Garware College of Commerce, said that last year the cut-off for Commerce at their college was 92 per cent. “Many students opting for Arts to prepare for civil services, may opt for colleges near their hometowns. A trend of online coaching for civil services may be seen. Even with this, the cut-offs are likely to go up as competition in the city is still there. Arts in Garware College closed at 80 per cent last year. And for Science, the cut-off was 85 per cent,” said Lele. Many top colleges, like Fergusson College, Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce (BMCC) are yet to declare their cut-offs for 2021. The expected date for the same is August 21.

These cards would have all the details related to farmers, including their Aadhar number, bank account, mobile number and land holding records. Later, we would also include the history of schemes and loans they have availed in the past,” said Nisha Oraon, director, agriculture.As per estimates, there are around 58 lakh farmers in the state. The agriculture department’s data is based on benefits availed under different schemes in the state. While the project would be implemented in phases and could take around three years to cover all eligible farmers, Oraon said the department was targeting to provide cards to atleast those farmers whose e-KYC has been done in the next two to three months.“The e-KYC was already done for around 3.5 lakh farmers for loan waiver recently. Issuing cards to them would not be a problem. After such farmers are covered, we would target those who have not been able to get any benefit in the past,” said Oraon.The official said in order to make it convenient for farmers living in remote areas, they are working to utilize banking correspondents for the e-KYC process. “Pragya kendras often get overcrowded. Many farmers live in remote areas making it difficult for farmers to do the formalities,” said Oraon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jkhand-unique-id-cards-for-farmers-under-new-birsa-kisan-initiative-101629304179313.html

There are 33,000 arhtiyas in the state and all farmers are linked to them. We want data to be matched before the start of (kharif) procurement,” said an officer of the food department.The Centre has made it compulsory for Punjab to carry out procurement after taking land details from farmers, who will get their payment (MSP) for their produce (wheat and paddy), only when the revenue record of their agriculture land is linked to the Public Finance Management System (PFMS). In rabi (wheat) procurement season this year, the state had implemented the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system, through PFMS, by transferring crop payment directly into farmers’ bank account, bypassing the traditional system of routing payment through the arhtiyas (commission agents). INTER-DEPARTMENTAL PROCESSOther than food and civil supplies department, the state’s revenue and agriculture departments, the state mandi board, Punjab Remote Sensing Centre and arhtiyas need to coordinate to ensure accurate matching of records. The state needs to match the PFMS, land record of the revenue department and the mandi board. The mandi board has the data as it prints J-forms to authenticate the sale of farmers’ produce. “It is a tedious process, but we have to implement it,” said a senior officer of state food department. During wheat procurement, the implementation of the DBT showed that there were 9.5 lakh farmers in the state. The number, however, is expected to go up in the paddy season as a greater number of farmers sell their produce to government agencies, unlike wheat, when private companies also make purchases. “The data management task is huge, as there 40 lakh Khewats, and matching it with procurement data is a tedious task. Errors may creep in. Another thing is that a large number of farmers are doing it on leased land, of which no data is available. In most cases, lease arrangement is through word of mouth. In spite of these challenges, we hope to complete the process before paddy procurement starts,” said principal secretary, food, Rahul Tiwari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/procurement-six-weeks-away-punjab-yet-to-integrate-land-record-of-40-of-its-farmers-101629303940602.html

It is worth mentioning that at around 2 am on Tuesday, an incident of cross-firing took place between Assam police and unknown miscreants from Mizoram’s side at Darashing Hills under Bilaipur Police Outpost of Hailakandi district. Nobody from the Assam side got injured in this firing but a Mizoram resident sustained injuries that were not due to bullets. Kolashib SP Vanlalfaka Ralte has informed that a 41-year-old lady identified as Lalduhawni broke her right arm while running back to Mizoram when the firing started. After initial treatment, doctors released her from the hospital and she is now at home under observation. He visited the border area on Wednesday afternoon but did not find anything suspicious in that area. Talking to Hindustan Times he said, “Assam police officials have alleged that the firing started from Mizoram side but no police from our district were present there when the incident happened. There were three civilians from Mizoram who did not have arms to fire bullets. We should stop instigating each other and refrain from making comments without any base.”Ralte also reached out to the three civilians who crossed the border on Monday night. About this, he said, “I have personally talked to those civilians who are residents of Vairengte area. They said they are friends with few families residing in the Bilaipur area of Assam’s Hailakandi district. They went to collect some food and other essential items when Assam police threatened them with bullets. We are not in a war zone and I don’t think the Assam government has given an order to their police to shoot on Mizo civilians at sight in border areas.”Assam police have claimed that the incident happened on Assam’s land which is not a disputed area. Kolasib SP Vanlalfaka Ralte did not make any comment on this. According to people privy to the development, as many as eight families have so far moved from Darashing Hills of Hailakandi’s Kathlicherra constituency to other areas after the firing took place. Denying this report, Hailakandi SP Gaurav Upadhyay said, “We visited the area and talked to several locals after the firing incident happened. Our officials are present at the border areas and there is no report of people shifting to other areas out of fear.”He also said that the situation is under control and police have asked the locals living in those areas to be alert. “There were attempts of encroachment from Mizoram’s side in past also. There were reports of stealing essentials by Mizo miscreants from Bilaipur. But on Monday night, our on-duty officials noticed some Mizo people inside Assam who were using some sort of signals with torch lights. When our officials were interrogating them, some unknown miscreants started firing from the upper side of the hill and our officials also counter fired. Now we have asked the locals to be alert but as per our report, nobody is leaving the area.” This was the second firing incident near the Assam-Mizoram border after July 26. Six Assam Police officials were killed in Lailapur area of Cachar district on July 26 which resulted in a mass economic blockade on the Assam side. After several talks between Assam and Mizoram, peace was restored in border areas. Neutral forces have been deployed in disputed areas where locals are not allowed to visit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/security-beefed-up-in-darashing-hill-near-assam-mizoram-border-after-fresh-firing-101629303939315.html

An FIR against Prasad was registered in this connection with the women’s police station in Gaya on May 27 this year. However, the Crime Investigation Department (CID) failed to trace him after which the Gaya POCSO court issued a non-bailable warrant issued against him on July 8. It also could not be executed before the deadline set for the purpose.In the advertisement, the weaker section wing of Crime Investigation Bureau has provided multiple contact numbers, appealing people to provide clues for the arrest of the suspended DSP. The DSP, who was posted as officer on special duty in Central Selection Board of Constable, was suspended on July 15 this year by the state government. Special public prosecutor of POCSO court in Gaya, Sunil Kumar, said as the arrest warrant issued against the accused DSP returned unexecuted, a request was made by the investigating officer (IO) for issuance of proclamation notice, which was approved by the court.Meanwhile, additional director general (weaker section) Anil Kishore Yadav said the police would request the court to issue a property attachment warrant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-govt-issues-ads-in-hunt-for-rape-accused-dsp-101629303459234.html

Giving this adage a practical shape, the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar administration and the state education department have developed a ‘Mobile Science and Computer Lab’. Intended to arouse curiosity and revive interest in science and computer subjects of government school students, the ₹48 lakh project has finally materialised, four years after it was mooted in 2017. SBS Nagar deputy commissioner Sheena Aggarwal will flag off the new AC bus with 12 computers, printers, LED screen and science models, including of the human body, on Monday. Two generators will power the gizmos.Rajya Sabha MP KTS Tulsi had given ₹21 lakh for the project under the Member Parliament Local Area Development (MPLAD) fund, with the district administration arranging the rest, after deciding to revive the project in July 2020.  “Three major challenges for the project were arranging the remaining budget, operational cost and execution. In December 2020, the education department approved the operational expense of the van, including salaries to the staff, fuel and other costs,” the DC added. “We have designed the project as per utility, where students can get practical knowledge and develop their interest in the science. It is not a showpiece, but meant for exploration,” added Sheena Aggarwal. District deputy education officer (secondary), Amrik Singh said, “We purchased a new bus for ₹35 lakh, including installation of the body works. Another ₹13 lakh have been spent on computers and science gizmos.” Singh, who is also the nodal officer of the project, said there are 740 schools in the district across categories. “We will cover high schools in the first phase and primary schools in the second phase of the project,” he added. District education officer (secondary) Jagjit Singh said two computer and two science teachers have been deputed with the van. Amrik added that the bus will visit two schools a day and train students practically. “Many students, especially in the Kandi area (Balachaur sub-division), lag in computers and science. These will be trained on priority. Advance topis will also be covered through practicals. We will also take the mobile van to villages and towns, as per need.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mobile-science-van-developed-in-sbs-nagar-for-students-to-explore-concepts-101629303399423.html
18-08-2021||Patna||Bihar links funding to audited accounts for aided colleges||The Bihar government has further tightened the regulations for giving performance grant to aided intermediate colleges and degree colleges in the state, a move that will have direct impact on 602 inter colleges and 225 affiliated degree colleges, which have been awaiting funding, including backlog for years. State’s education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said Wednesday that the institutions needing performance grants would have to present audited accounts, indicating they have used previous grants to disburse salary to their teachers and staff through real time gross settlement (RTGS) or direct benefit transfer and spent 70% of their internal resources on it. “There have been a lot of complaints regarding exploitation of teachers and staff, who don’t get paid properly despite institutions getting performance grants. Now the endeavour is to ensure that the performance grants go to the performing teachers and staff of the institutions, not the ghost ones. The institutions are also supposed to use 70% of their internal resources on salary to teachers and staff,” he said. This is not the first time the government has tried to regulate the mushrooming affiliated colleges. On March 26, 2008, the government had linked payments to institutions to their performance, reflected in their pass percentage, in the hope that things would improve, but it did not. Later, it was made more specific. Better the performance of students, higher the allocation, with different slabs for first, second and third division. Though it brought sudden improvement in the results of little-known intermediate colleges, which even beat established institutions with far better infrastructure and faculty strength, doubts over their functioning further deepened due to emergence of toppers like Ruby Roy, who could not even name the subjects she studied. As soon as the government linked funding to performance, several institutions allegedly terminated the services of old teachers and appointed their kith and kin or started using ghost names. This prompted the government to issue another directive in 2010 that the grants of institutions making payment to illegally appointed teachers and employees would be stopped. The government made it binding on the institutions to make payment through cheques to maintain transparency. However, things did not reach any conclusion again due to the enormous clout of these institutions, though funding often remained suspended for years. In 2010, during scrutiny of records and physical verification of Magadh University colleges, the department had detected 10 unaided institutions working on paper only. In 2012 also, the government admitted there was fudging of records by some colleges and formed inspection teams for all the aided affiliated colleges. During a meeting with chancellor of universities a couple of years ago, many vice chancellors raised the issue of affiliated colleges and how they used their enormous clout and even muscle power to dictate terms.Former MU VC Qamar Hasan had once said he had apprised Raj Bhawan of the problems. “In fact, the biggest problem is that affiliated colleges don’t keep track of admissions and the process goes on till the last moment before examination. We have tried to stop this practice, but it is a tough ask. The students are incited and they ransacked the MU office in protest against action. The affiliated colleges lack a transparent system,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-links-funding-to-audited-accounts-for-aided-colleges-101629303279207.html

According to draft proposal of the UDD, approved by the cabinet on Tuesday, the user charge has been fixed in accordance with the property tax of the premises and nature of consumption. For individual use, each household have to pay the monthly charge in the range ₹40 to ₹150 per month. Private houses have been exempted from paying the one-time fixed charge, while commercial and other premises will pay a one-time charge in the range of ₹2,400 to ₹12,000.Sanjay Kumar, additional chief secretary, cabinet secretariat department, said those having their own independent water supply system would not be required to pay water tax. “Only such houses and installations require paying it, which get the supply from har ghar nal ka jal scheme. The user charge has been mooted to manage the running expenses of the water supply system installed by the government,” Kumar said.A senior officer of the UDD said that barring individual houses, all other installations connected with the water supply system are required to pay the one-time tax, which would mainly be raising the infrastructure for water supply. “The one-time charge is non-refundable. User charge for commercial and other premises increases if the consumption is higher,” said the officer, adding that the water tariff would be enforced once it was notified in the state gazette.A few months ago, panchayati raj department has also notified user charge for water consumption in rural areas. As per the tariff finalised for rural areas, each household getting the tap water supply are required to pay monthly charge of ₹30.

Organiser of the event, Haji Aslam Qureshi, chairman of Local Islamia Agency, lodged the case at the Mantola police station of Agra.“A complaint was lodged against Mazdul Kuddoos Khubaib Rumi, the shahar mufti and his son, Hammadul Kuddoos, by the chairman of Local Islamia Agency, Haji Aslam Qureshi. The case has been registered and investigation is on. Required action will follow,” stated Muniraj G, SSP, Agra. The case was registered under Section 3 of Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 and sections 153-B, 505, 505 (1)(b) and section 508 of the Indian Penal Code. The complainant had been provided security by the police after he raised apprehension of threat to his life from the shahar mufti, who purportedly used strong words in an audio that went viral.

His announcement came on the day when the petroleum companies hiked the price of LPG cylinder by ₹25, costing it about ₹880 in Dehradun. “Amid the uncontrollable rise of prices of groceries and LPG cylinder, the women of Uttarakhand are badly suffering. But they deserve some direct relief in the suffering. For this, the Congress party, if voted to power, will provide a subsidy amount of ₹200 on LPG cylinder to the women hailing from non-income-tax payee households. It won’t give a significant relief but will help reduce the burden to some extent,” said Rawat who is also heading the election campaign committee for 2022 polls. He said, “In the first year of tenure, the subsidy amount will be ₹200 but it will be gradually increased in the following years. Though the state is not capable of this, our party will do it to provide some relief to our mothers and sisters.” Attacking the BJP-led state government, he said, “This government has failed on every front. Today, not only the cooking stoves are burning but the budget of kitchens is also burning with no relief in sight. The Ujjawala scheme launched by the NDA government to provide LPG cylinders to poor women has now blackened. People are now unable to buy cylinders under it due to skyrocketing fuel prices.” Rawat had earlier announced free power up to 100 units to all the households of the state in the first year of its government followed by up to 200 units in the next year. The BJP meanwhile, played down Rawat’s announcement as a “mere political gimmick.” “His announcement has no importance because he himself is fighting for his existence in the party. It is just a poll gimmick and nothing else,” said Devendra Bhasin, BJP state vice president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/cong-to-provide-rs-200-subsidy-on-lpg-cylinder-if-voted-to-power-in-uttarakhand-harish-rawat-101629296380198.html

"Former Tripura Speaker Jiten Sarkar has sent me a letter saying he and others want to join TMC," ANI said quoting Banerjee.The Bengal chief minister, who has been trying to make in-roads in the northeastern state, after her resounding victory in the Assembly elections in Bengal earlier this year, expressed confidence in her party's ability to win Tripura. "We will win Tripura next," she told ANI.Sarkar, a veteran politician, left the Congress in 2016 to rejoin Communist Party of India (Marxist), the party he deserted in 2008. He would be the second high profile political figure to join TMC, following in the footsteps of Sushmita Dev, who left Congress to join Trinamool in the presence of senior party leaders Abhishek Banerjee and Derek O'Brien in Kolkata on August 16.Dev, a former Member of Parliament (MP) and chief of the All India Mahila Congress, sent her resignation letter to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi but offered no reason for it. "I have a long relationship with the Congress and I have written everything about that in my resignation letter. I got many opportunities in Congress and I tried to do justice to all the responsibilities. Many people tried to call me, but I was not available. On August 15, I gave the Congress president my resignation," she told reporters in Kolkata.Eyeing the upcoming Tripura polls TMC leader and Banerjee's nephew Abhishek Banerjee has constituted a team of senior leaders who will be camping in the northeastern state every month. This newly formed team comprises all veteran TMC leaders like Bratya Basu, Moloy Ghatak, Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, Ritabrata Banerjee, former legislator Samir Chakraborty, and party spokesperson Kunal Ghosh.“TMC leaders will be camping in Tripura to help the party expand its base ahead of the elections. Abhishek Banerjee himself went to Tripura earlier this week. This will help boost the party’s grassroot level infrastructure and let them know that senior party leaders are standing beside them," a TMC leader told Hindustan Times. Banerjee herself promised to implement welfare schemes of the West Bengal government in Tripura. "We want Bengal's schemes to be implemented in Tripura," she said on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-banerjee-sets-sights-on-tripura-says-former-speaker-jiten-sarkar-wants-to-join-tmc-101629294003967.html

Two others are admitted at a government hospital in Balrampur district, officials said on Wednesday.Following the deaths, the district administration has kicked off a health checkup drive for people belonging to Pando tribal community in the region.According to officials, while one death took place in the house of the affected family in the village, two others, including the head of the family, succumbed in a government hospital of neighbouring Surguja district. Two other members of the family who are admitted to the hospital are said to be out of danger, they said.The population of the Pando community stands at around 4,000 and they mainly live in at least 30 villages of the Balrampur and Surajpur districts in northern Chhattisgarh.Pandos are mostly small farmers, forest dwellers and labourers working in different places of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand.Uday Pando, a representative of the community, claimed that Upendra Pando (9) died in Dolangi village of Balrampur district on August 14 after suffering from illness for a week.“When tribals came to his house to perform his last rites they found that his father Ramlakhan Pando (32) and elder brother Dinesh Pando (12) were also ill for a long time. The tribal pooled money and shifted the duo to a government hospital in Ambikapur where the father-son duo died on August 18,” said Pando. Two other sons of Ramlakhan —Virendra Pando (14) and Jitendra Pando (8) - who were also suffering from fever are admitted to a hospital in Balrampur, Pando said, adding that the two are said to be out of danger.According to Pando, the affected family was trying to cure illness through traditional medicinal plants available in the area and did not inform anyone in the village about their suffering.“The cause of deaths of two who died in the hospital in Surguja is multiple organ failure. There was a severe infection in their liver, as per the doctors,” said Surguja collector Sanjeev Jha.Meanwhile, the district administration of Balrampur has started a drive for medical examination of the Pando community in the region.“The deaths took place because they have not informed anyone and were relying on traditional medicinal plants. We have a community health check-up nearby the village. After the death, a health team is camping in the village and a special drive for medical examination of Pando tribals has started under the supervision of the collector,” said Abhishek Gupta, the local sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), Ramanujganj, Balrampur.Block Medical Officer, Dr Kailash Karatiya said that the two kids who were admitted to the district hospital are out of danger. “We are examining all members of the community and medical teams have been sent to various villages of the region,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/3-members-of-pando-tribe-die-due-to-multiple-organ-failure-in-chhattisgarh-101629289541003.html

18-08-2021||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh skips ED summons again; offers to cooperate with agency||Former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Wednesday again skipped the summons issued by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with the allegations of corruption and extortion against him. On Tuesday, the ED had issued fresh summons to the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader a day after the Supreme Court refused to grant any interim relief to him, and asked him to appear at the agency’s South Mumbai office.However, today his counsel, advocate Inderpal Singh submitted a letter from the leader that he said he received on e-mail. In his letter, Deshmukh says that while refusing him interim relief, the apex court has granted him liberty to seek appropriate remedy available under the Code of Criminal Procedure and accordingly, he has decided to move appropriate court in a day or two.Deshmukh has requested ED officials to wait for the outcome of the court proceedings that he intends to initiate. In the meantime, he has offered to make himself available for recording his statement by electronic medium of the agency’s choice.ED has registered a money laundering case against Deshmukh after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a first information report (FIR) against him on April 21. Deshmukh had in the past said that the allegations against him are false.Also Read | Congress slams government over LPG price increaseThe central agency has alleged that while serving as the Maharashtra home minister, Deshmukh misused his position, and through assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze – who has now been dismissed and is in Taloja jail for his alleged role in the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran murder case – collected ₹4.7 crore from Mumbai’s bars for their “smooth functioning”.Later, through hawala channels, this money was sent to two brothers in Delhi who operated bogus companies, said the agency. It claimed that at the behest of Deshmukh’s son, Hrishikesh, the two brothers diverted the money as donations to Nagpur-based Shri Sai Shikshan Sansthan, an educational trust controlled by the Deshmukhs.The anti-money laundering agency also said that Vaze, in his statement to ED said he was called to Deshmukh’s official residence and directed to collect ₹3 lakh from every bar and restaurant in the city. He was also given a list of the establishmentsDuring investigation, ED has identified 24 private entities that are controlled by the Deshmukh family and found that huge sums of money were transacted among them without any rationale.“From the analysis of the bank accounts of these companies, it is clear that there is no rationale for the transfers, and thus it can be said that these series of transactions were meant for inflating balance sheets and layering of money from one company to other,” ED stated.The agency arrested Deshmukh’s personal secretary Sanjeev Palande and assistant Kundan Shinde on June 26, claiming that they had handled the money laundering linked to extortions for the leader.In mid-July, the anti-money laundering agency provisionally attached Deshmukh’s properties, worth ₹4.2 crore. The attached assets include a residential flat in Worli valued at ₹1.54 crore and 25 land parcels of book value ₹2.67 crore at Dhutum village at Uran in the neighbouring Raigad district.Deshmukh has, however, maintained that the case against him was political witch-hunting. He said the allegations against him, made by former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh, cropped up only after the cop was shunted out as the commissioner over his poor handling of the Antilia and the Hiran murder cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/anil-deshmukh-skips-ed-summons-again-offers-to-cooperate-with-agency-101629283299182.html
18-08-2021||Other||Sutradhara’s Tales: Parvati hill bears witness to ups and downs of Peshwa rule in Pune||The Parvati hill temple complex has been the recipient of sustained attention and patronage of the Peshwa family since its inception. It still stands as a symbol of Peshwa rule in Pune and speaks of their religious ethos. It also stands as a fine example of Maratha architecture of the 18th century.Nanasaheb Peshwa appointed his personal affairs’ clerk, Bajirao Baburao Dike and Ravaji Keshav Dike who look after the temple construction. They were supervised by sardar Khajgiwale.The five pinnacles of the Devdeveshwar temple were fitted with gold in 1760-61 - 10.20kg of gold was utilised. The interesting phenomena of “Kirnotsarga” or sunrays illuminating the shivalinga of the Devdeveshwar complex takes place for two-three days during the cycle of Uttarayana (movement of sun between Winter Solstice and Summer Solstice). A similar phenomenon is observed in the case of the temple of Vishnu, established in 1758, where the idol of Madhava Vishnu is illuminated during Dakshinayana (movement of sun between Summer Solstice and Winter Solstice).Nanansaheb Peshwa was heartbroken due to the severe loss suffered by the Marathas during the battle of Panipat and passed away on June 23, 1761, at Peshwa wada on Parvati. His death anniversary is still observed with pensive remembrance.Raghoba Dada Peshwe, younger brother of Nanasaheb, had constructed a temple dedicated to Kartikeya swami, which was damaged during the Nizam’s attack. It was later reinstalled by Madhavrao Peshwa, which again suffered damaged in various unfortunate events. The present kartikeya idol was consecrated on June 28, 1869. Peshwas were very concerned about the safety of idols and in case of an emergency, such as an attack on Pune, they would move the idols along with the treasury to fort Sinhagad. For the same reason, the idols were kept safe at fort Sinhagad from November 17, 1751, to March 1, 1752, during the Hyderabad Nizam’s first attack.When the Hyderabad Nizam attacked Pune shortly after the demise of Nanasaheb Peshwa in 1763, considerable damage happened to the idols and temples of Parvati. Almost half of Pune was ransacked. The Nizam cut the golden pinnacles as he looted Parvati and city of Pune. The stone idols were severely destroyed. However, Madhavrao Peshwa restored the temples back to their glory. He also reinstated the idol of lord Vishnu in March 1766. Similarly, the six-faced Kartikeya idol was reinstated around the same time. He fitted the temple pinnacles with gold. Later, the idols were moved to fort Sinhagad during the attack of the Bhosales of Nagpur on Pune, in 1768- 69, and during Sawai Madhavrao’s period.The Dike family remained in service of the upkeep of complex till 1803, when Bajirao II took charge. After the Treaty of Vasai, Bajirao II removed the Dike family and Khajgiwale and appointed his own personal affairs’ clerk, Baburao Ganesh Katre. The lack of a proper pathway made it difficult for the Peshwa paraphernalia to climb the hill. Hence, Bajirao II commissioned 103 broad stairs to be built to access Parvati hill. The stairs were so wide, that camels and elephants could ascend without difficulty.In fact, when Albert Edward the VII, the Prince of Wales, visited Parvati in 1875 on an elephant, the pachyderm tripped at stair number 56 causing the Prince to have an embarrassing fall.During the famous battle of Khadki between the Peshwas and the British in 1817, Bajirao II made sure that the idols were shifted to Sinhagad. Maratha troops, on November 1817 gathered at Khandoba maal near Khadki, the location of the present Deccan College, under the command of Bapu Gokhale,. Bajirao II instead of leading the battle chose to watch it helplessly from the northern arched pavilion of the Devdeveshwar complex of Parvati hill through a telescope gifted to him by the East India Company in 1803. Thus, the once glorious Parvati hill silently watched the downfall of the Marathas, who lost the battle to the British on November 16, 1817. The British governor, however, returned the idols retrieved during capture of fort Sinhagad and reinstated them, fearing public outrage.Subsequently, the temple of Vitthal Rukmini was built in 1931. As we climb the stairs, the sacred platform of Vetal, the Mangirbabba shrine, the remains of Math, and the Sati memorial in the form of Tulsi Vrundavan are seen. A lone Nandi is installed at stair number 75. A room nearby known as the talim room housed two cannons which were fired on special occasions. These cannons were moved in 1879 as a matter of precaution, during the rebellion of freedom fighter Vasudev Balwant Phadke.Two nearby rooms are the clock room and drum room, which are next to the sajja, a viewing gallery. The Vitthal temple is situated at the end of stairs, while the newly built Peshwa museum is to the left. The museum originally was a two-storeyed spacious wada of the Peshwas and was equipped with a pooja room, kitchen, storage room, maajghar, a room to make prasad, hom shala (ritual room) and sahanechi kholi (pooja preparation).Every year, auspicious Mondays of the Shravan month and the Mahashivratri festival are celebrated at the Devdeveshwar temple. Vaikunth Chaturdashi is observed at Vishnu temple and Ashadh-Kartik Ekadashi are observed at the Vitthal temple. The full moon day of the Kartik month is celebrated at the Kartikeya temple. Peshwas were keen on conducting various family rituals such as the Upanayana ceremony of Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa, at the Parvati temples.Till the year 1929, entry of dalits was prohibited at the Parvati temples. Inspired by similar movements led by Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, progressive activists planned a protest to allow entry of dalits into the temple complex of Parvati hill on October 13, 1929. The protest was led by progressive activists such as NV Gadgil, SM Joshi, Keshavrao Jedhe, Vinayak Bhuskute, Shivram Kamble, SS Thorat and others. However, a group of orthodox people attacked the protesters with sticks and threw stones at them as protesters climbed the stairs. NV Gadgil, Deshdas Ranade and Rajbhoj were severely injured. Entry was opened at all temples in Maharashtra after the Kalaram temple protest in Nasik by Dr Ambedkar and the Vitthal temple protest by Savarkar.Thus, all throughout the 18th century, the religious complex of Parvati flourished and expanded. Various attacks, natural disasters and thefts were unfortunate, but they could not overshadow the luminance of the Peshwa legacy and grandeur. Even today, Parvati hill is flocked to by health conscious Punekars who climb the hill and relive the Peshwa heritage as they glance at the town of Pune from the arches of “Devdeveshwar”.Saili Palande-Datar is an indologist, environmentalist, history researcher and farmer.

18-08-2021||Bangalore||Bangalore Talkies | The city’s favourite monsoon snack— nippattu||When the monsoon makes its appearance in Bengaluru, as it has done now, the oil starts sizzling. South Indian kitchens keep their tryst with their gastronomic destiny, not wholly or in full measure (given the number of people who are on intermittent fasting diets these days) but very substantially.When it rains, South Indian kitchens start taking out their deep-frying kadhais. This moment comes, not rarely because every South Indian Mami (aunty) worth her salt will deep-fry papad or ‘happala’ pretty much everyday. It is a neat trick, performed in most traditional homes. After all, what better way to disguise leftovers? You simply serve them with piping hot ‘happala’ or ‘sandige’ (vadams or fritters) on top. These white tapioca discs will sit, like snow on Mt. Everest, hiding all flaws underneath. “Eat your vegetables before you can get dessert” is a Western admonition or threat. Here, in Bengaluru, we tempt our families to eat yesterday’s curries by serving a savoury temptation on top.The monsoon is another matter. All over Bengaluru these days, you see copious and heavy rain clouds that shed their weight through day and night. We are all stuck at home. Naturally, we reach for the much-loved snack that we call nippattu. Tamilians call it thattai. Andhra folks call this chekkalu. I would submit that the nippattu is a lot better than the other regional variations because of one subtle yet strong ingredient: the generous use of sesame seeds, peanuts, roasted gram (putani or chutney kadalai) and curry leaves. All this makes the nippattu easy to store and stay crispy for longer-- which after all, is the point of South Indian snacks. In that sense, the nippattu is onomatopoeic. It sounds like it bites.Also Read | Bangalore Talkies: What does Karnataka’s new CM like to dine on?The recipe is simple. You gently fry skinned peanuts and grind it along with equal quantities of white sesame seeds, roasted gram, and, if you like, copra or dried coconut flakes. Then mix rice flour, sooji rava (for crunch) and maida (to hold the thing together). Add your spices: asafoetida, chili powder, salt. Then add the roasted peanut mixture. Mix oil and water to knead the mixture into small balls. Pat into small round flat circles about the size of a jam jar lid. Deep fry.Some cooks artfully poke tiny holes with a fork on the nippattu’s surface for some design and to keep the crispiness. Others pour hot ghee over the whole mixture before adding water and kneading into balls. No matter. The taste comes from the sesame-peanut mixture and the satisfactory crunch when you bite into it.The purpose of a nippattu is to please the palate on a monsoon afternoon. Bengaluru’s nature community, numbering in the thousands, carry nippattu in their backpacks as they hike up Nandi hills or Savanadurga. Birdwatchers who throng Bengaluru’s lakes do the same-- along with the binoculars are the crunchies. Last week, I stood under my black umbrella feeling the thud of a monsoon shower, training my binoculars on a pond heron that was in brown breeding plumage, while my mouth rhythmically crunched on a homemade nippattu. I feel like a heroine in one of Kalidasa’s poems.Most of the Iyengar bakeries in the city sell decent nippattu. But if you want really good ones you have to find stores with the name “condiments” in them. Pavithra Condiments in Basavanagudi, Subbamma Stores or Srinivasa Condiments in Gandhi bazaar and Malnad Condiments in multiple locations are good places to start. Any store with a name that begins with Uttara Karnataka or North Karnataka is also a good bet.Traditional kannadigas strictly eat their nippattu at tea time but this rule is relaxed in the monsoon when the nippattu tin is reached for anytime it rains. To stand on a Bengaluru balcony and watch the red earth and pounding rain is an exercise in relaxation. Two things can enhance this experience: masala chai and a plate of six nipattus. Not more, not less. The first two nipattus are pretty much scarfed down. You don’t really taste them because you are dunking them in tea. The next two are really about slowing down and taking in the beautiful early rains or mungaru male (also a superhit Kannada movie about a stalker-- thus making something that is weird and scary into something that is acceptable). The last two nippattus are really where this snack sings. By then, you’ve almost downed your tea. Your stomach is full and you’ve slowed down. You have enjoyed the beauty of the downpour and can finally focus on this humble snack that was so far, just a crunchy accompaniment. Now you taste the layers, the flavours and the tiny shots of sesame seeds that get stuck in between your teeth. You can taste the peanuts, the bite of chili and the gentle aroma of fried gram. The nippattu is now elevated in your mouth to not just an afternoon snack but a rainy memory.And that, my friend, is the power of a nippattu.Shoba Narayan is Bengaluru-based award-winning author.

18-08-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Elephants block railway track after 2 in herd killed in train-hit||A furious herd of elephants blocked railway traffic on Lalkuan-Kashipur section in Uttarakhand’s Kumaon region after a female elephant and her male offspring were hit by a train on Wednesday morning. Passengers of the train had to be sent to their destinations in buses and few other trains were suspended till noon, when the track was finally cleared after the herd calmed down and was driven into the wild by forest officials.“We saw an adult elephant and baby elephant lying dead on the railway track. The elephant herd there was very furious. We waited for a while and then drove them away from the track,” said Harish Pandey, ranger, Peepal Parao forest range under Terai-Central Forest division in Kumaon.Pandey said the two elephants were hit by a speeding Agra Fort train which was headed to Ramnagar from Lalkuan at about 5 am on Wednesday. “When it reached Peepal Parao forest range, 4 km from Rudrapur Sidcul halt, a herd of elephants was crossing the track. The train hit an adult female and its offspring, who died on the spot. After this, the rest of the elephants in the herd got furious and surrounded their bodies, blocking the train traffic,” he said.The train had to be reversed to Rudrapur Sidcul halt and its passengers were de-boarded and sent to Bazpur, Kashipur, and Ramnagar in buses. Kashipur-Kasganj train heading towards Lalkuan was stopped at Gularbhoj and sent back to Kashipur and some other trains were cancelled on this route till noon, railway officials said.In the meanwhile, forest officials rushed to the accident spot and waited for the herd to calm down before driving them into the forest area.“The killed female elephant was around 40-year old while the calf was about 2 to 3 months’ old. We informed our seniors and removed their bodies from the track,” said Pandey.AG Ansari, Kumaon based wildlife activist said human error was responsible for this incident. “Early warning system is needed to avoid such incidents in the future. Forest department should take initiative and railways, too, should control the speed of the trains.”In the past, several elephants have been killed in train hit incidents, especially in the state’s Tarai area. In July 2020, a three-year-old elephant was killed on railway tracks in Nakraunda area of Dehradun forest division. In November last year, a 35-year-old female elephant was hit by a train. In May 2018, a five-year-old female elephant died on the Lalkuan-Bareilly railway track in the Nainital district. In March 2018, an elephant died near Nagla bypass on the Lalkuan-Bareilly railway line. In April 2017, two elephant calves were killed near Haldi railway station.Elephant population in Uttarakhand has reached 2026, according to the elephant census held last year. It is a 29.9% increase since 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-elephants-block-railway-track-after-2-in-herd-killed-in-trainhit-101629277897177.html
18-08-2021||Delhi||#TalibanCrisis: Afghans in Delhi worried about family back home||Ahmad Khan, a teacher from Afghanistan, made south Delhi’s Jangpura his home years ago, and is now among the many who are glued to their TV sets in anxiety as the Afghanistan-Taliban crisis deepens. Excessively stressed about the well-being of his family back home, Khan rues, “My mother, younger sister and elder brother are all in Kabul. They are in a very bad situation, and 24 hours they are inside the house! I keep calling them continuously, to check on them, and to make sure that they are all fine. I am very worried. And we can’t even go there,” rues Khan. The ongoing turmoil in Afghanistan has left many Afghans like Khan, who are living in the Capital, in a similar state of worry. A Delhi-based student, Zainab Hamidi, who is studying in Jamia Millia Islamia, is also in grave despair regarding the safety of her relatives back home. “I’m unable to contact anyone... My parents are here with me but my relatives, uncle and aunty are back home in Afghanistan, and since Monday, we haven’t had any contact with them! Their mobiles aren’t working. I’m hoping they are all safe. We can only pray for their safety and well-being right now,” says Hamidi, and Sharara Naderi, another Delhi-based college student from Afghanistan, adds, “My parents are thankfully here. Par mere chacha, bua, maasi, sab wahan hain...Woh log bahut zyada dare hue hai. Hum yahan news follow kar rahe hain. We are getting very emotional on what is going to happen now. When I called my cousin, he said he was at the bank withdrawing money, and he burst out crying while speaking to me. Hum logon ne kaha usko ki daro mat. Par hum yahan khud bahut pareshan hain un sab ke liye.”Sherazuddin Kamalzada, another Delhiite from Afghanistan, says his sister, mother and relatives are stuck in his home country, which has left him with sleepless nights since the news broke. “Woh safe nahin hai. Halat bahut kharab hain. Hum bahut tension mein hain. Woh, abhi airport mein hain since four hours. Wahan bahut problem hain.

18-08-2021||Patna||Bihar narrows parameters for performance grants to colleges||The Bihar government has narrowed the parameters for aiding intermediate colleges and degree colleges with grants, officials said, adding that this decision would impact 602 inter-colleges and 225 affiliated degree colleges, which were awaiting funding and clearance of backlog for years. Bihar education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary on Wednesday said the institutions that needed performance grants would have to present audited accounts, indicating that they have used previous grants to disburse salaries to their teachers and staff through realtime gross settlement (RTGS) or direct benefit transfer and spent 70% of their internal resources on it. “There have been a lot of complaints regarding exploitation of teachers and staff, who don’t get paid properly despite institutions getting performance grants. Now the endeavour is to ensure that the performance grants go to the teachers and staff of the institutions. The institutions are also supposed to use 70% of their internal resources on salaries for teachers and staff,” he said. This is not the first time the government has tried to regulate affiliated colleges. The government abolished the unaided education policy on March 26, 2008 and decided to make payments to institutions on the basis of their performance, directly linked to the pass percentage of the actual number of students, in the hope that things would improve. Also Read | Cabinet gives nod, Bihar to recruit school heads through BPSC examLater the scheme was made more specific -- the better the performance of students, the higher the allocation, with different slabs for first, second and third division. Though it brought a sudden improvement in the results of little-known inter-colleges, beating even established institutions with far better infrastructure and faculty strength, ambiguity over their functioning deepened due to the emergence of toppers who could not even name the subjects they studied. As soon as the government linked funding to performance, several institutions allegedly terminated the services of old teachers and appointed their kith and kin or started using ghost names. This prompted the government to issue a directive in 2010 that the grants of institutions making payments to illegally appointed teachers and employees would be stopped. The government made it binding on the institution managements to make payment through cheques to maintain transparency. In 2010, during the scrutiny of records and physical verification of Magadh University (MU) colleges, the department had detected 10 unaided institutions on paper only. The department had then decided to categorise institutions in three categories – A, B and C-- on the basis of their records, but that, too, did not materialise. In 2012 also, the government admitted record fudging by some colleges and formed inspection teams for all the aided affiliated colleges. During a meeting of university chancellors a couple of years ago, several vice-chancellors (V-C) raised the issue of affiliated colleges and how they used their enormous clout and even muscle power to dictate terms. In Veer Kuer Singh University, a V-C resigned due to undue pressure, while another V-C, who tried to resist, had to face inquiry. Former MU V-C Qamar Hasan once said that he apprised Raj Bhavan of the problems. “In fact, the biggest problem is that affiliated colleges don’t keep track of admissions and the process goes on till the last moment before examination. We have tried to stop this practice, but it is a tough ask. The students are incited and they ransacked the MU office in protest against action. The affiliated colleges lack a transparent system,” he added. Another V-C said it was high time the government showed the will to regulate affiliated colleges, which often tried to hijack the system with fudged enrolment figures, no transparency in admission process and academic activities and attempts to manage results. “The government linked performance to funding with good intention. After all, if the performance of colleges improves genuinely, it is a positive sign and for this the teachers need to be rewarded. The government gives funds for payment to teachers and staff of colleges functioning as per laid down norms. We will ensure it evenly across all aided institutions and those flouting it will have to face the music,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-narrows-parameters-for-performance-grants-to-colleges-101629274776957.html

He also reiterated that the allegations against him were “preposterous”.“I have weathered dozens of unfounded accusations and media vilification patiently, sustained by my faith in the Indian judiciary, which today stands vindicated. In our justice system, the process is all too often the punishment,” he said in a statement.The former Union minister, currently on bail in the case, was accused of abetment after Pushkar, his wife, was found dead in a hotel suite in 2014. He was also charge-sheeted by the Delhi Police under Sections 498-A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) and 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).In the statement, Tharoor added, “The fact that justice has been done, at last, will allow all of us in the family to mourn Sunanda in peace.”Also Read | Sunanda Pushkar case: Shashi Tharoor cleared of charges by Delhi courtHe also thanked his lawyers Vikas Pahwa and Gaurav Gupta. Speaking on the verdict, Pahwa told reporters that it was a long battle but ultimately, “justice has prevailed”. He said that Tharoor had faith in the judicial system right from the beginning, which is why he challenged the “absurd and preposterous” charges of abetment to suicide and cruelty levelled by the police.Public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava stressed that Pushkar underwent mental cruelty that led to her bad health. He also argued that it was not an accidental death and relied on the post mortem report which suggested that the cause of death was poisoning which could be oral or injected.Special Judge Goel gave her verdict in a virtual hearing in which Tharoor was also present. Tharoor told the court this was a “seven-and-a-half years of absolute torture”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/faith-in-judiciary-vindicated-says-shashi-tharoor-on-court-verdict-101629274657213.html
18-08-2021||Delhi||Monsoon mingling: Sun romances Delhi sky||Life in the pandemic has been and continues to be predominantly indoors, for most of us. Be it due to #WFH or the sensibility to follow Covid-19 protocols and maintain social distancing, by avoiding unnecessary visits to public places. But neither of this forces us to make our lives mundane. Wonder how? Look at the August skies of Delhi, in the evenings, and there lies the answer to how Nature has the ability to uplift our spirits. The heart fills with joy seeing the view that one is witnessing in Delhi, of late. The sky seems to have turned into a magical canvas, which changes its hues to reflect the sun’s varied mood swings! If one dusk marks the bright sun as present with beaming energy, the other ticks off its rays showing intermittently in the appearance of the clouds. These moments that are thus created, are so bewitching that it appears as if almost every day the city’s sky is getting dressed in a new shade, to show itself with aplomb, just before the sun sets on the horizon. And this is the thought that inspired our photographers to capture the many avatars that the Delhi sky takes in the monsoon months. And what our photographers witnessed in the process of exploring it, is displayed in the pictures here. Four days, four different shades: Stationed at Dwarka, our lensman spotted the sky turn from clear grey to pink, dark grey and then blue, all from the same spot! This colour scheme was observed over a span of four days, and is a perfect example of how the heavens can fascinate us. Day 1Day 2Day 3Day 4Have you looked at the sky, yet?

18-08-2021||Bhopal||MP govt calls reduction in number of abandoned children ‘technical error’||The Madhya Pradesh government has called a 32% reduction in its data of abandoned children during the second wave of Covid-19 “a technical error”, after emerging as the state with the highest number of such recorded cases. A National Commission for Child Rights Protection (NCPCR) status report on orphans and abandoned children between April 2020 and June 2021, submitted to the Supreme Court, had pegged the number of abandoned children at 226, of a total of 274 recorded throughout the country. A month later, a similar status report, submitted on July 23, brought the number down to 153. When NCPCR sought an explanation for the change in the data, officials of the Madhya Pradesh Women and Child Development Department said that this was due to a “technical mistake” in the submission of data in the Bal Swaraj portal. NCPCR chairperson Priyank Kanoongo said, “Due to a technical mistake and submission of data in haste, the department submitted incorrect data which they later rectified. But we are verifying the details of every child through a social investigation report. We are handling the case very sensitively.” Also Read | India has administered at least 560 million Covid vaccine doses till nowMadhya Pradesh Women and Child Development Department joint director Vishal Nadkarni admitted that they had asked for an “edit option” in the data as district child protection officers had entered incorrect details. “They included children in the age group 6 to 12 years who were found at different places and shifted to child care institutions, but they could be those who went missing rather than who were abandoned, so we rectified the data. We informed protection officers about the definition of abandoned children and 73 were found inappropriate for the category,” he added. Child rights activists in Madhya Pradesh asked where the 73 children were. “The biggest question is that where are these 73 children. Are they still in shelter homes? Are the authorities sure that they are missing and have not been abandoned by parents? The woman and child department shouldn’t behave so irresponsibly because this matter is being monitored by the apex court,” said Prashant Dubey, a child rights activist. Ashok Shah, Principal Secretary, WCD, said that it was “human error.” “The MP government has no intention to hide data. We are helping orphan kids and providing ₹6000 per month to them with free ration and free education. We are one of the leading states where more than a thousand children are being taken care of by the government under the Bal Sewa scheme,” he said.Apart from abandoned children, Madhya Pradesh has also reported 885 orphaned children, second only to Gujarat with 947.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-govt-calls-reduction-in-number-of-abandoned-children-technical-error-101629266616125.html

Jeevika didis is the popular name for women who run self-help groups (SHGs) in Bihar. They said the rakhis made up of mulberry silk, drawn from cocoons, were meant to symbolise the purity of ‘Resham ki Dori’ used to tie brothers and sisters in a bond.“The rakhis we made for the PM and the President were same as ‘Resham ki dori’ and symbolised our wish to see the Prime Minister’s ‘AatmaNirbhar Bharat’ (self-reliant India) bid become a reality,” said Meera Devi and Munni Devi, who were involved in the running of the Adarsh Jeevika Mahila Mulberry Resham Utpadak Samooh, a women’s cooperative for production of Mulberry silk at Amari village in Dhamdaha area of Purnia district.

It now needs to purchase at least two million syringes, they added.“There is some shortage of syringes. By saving the (doses of) vaccines, we have consumed the syringes the Centre provided. We now need to procure a few lakh syringes,” said Ajoy Chakraborty, the director of West Bengal Health Services.West Bengal has received around 30 million doses of Covishield and Covaxin from the Centre. From each vial of Covishield, 10 doses can be retrieved, and the Centre provided syringes proportionally.Also Read | Bengal’s new e-service to clear building plans, mutation, trade licence in 15 days“While wastage up to 10% is allowed in each vial... with a little efficiency one can also retrieve 11 doses from each Covishield vial.

18-08-2021||Other||Cabinet gives nod, Bihar to recruit school heads through BPSC exam||PATNAThe Bihar cabinet on Tuesday cleared a proposal to create separate cadres of head teachers in primary schools and head masters in the higher secondary schools of the state, two days after chief minister Nitish Kumar made an announcement to this effect in his Independence Day address in Patna.So far, government school teachers appointed through panchayati raj institutions were promoted as school heads, who will now be recruited by the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) through a competitive examination, education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said, adding that the decision reflected the government’s focus on improving quality of education in government schools.“Bihar will appoint 40,500 head teachers in primary schools and 5,300 head masters in the higher secondary schools. For higher secondary schools, those out of the government school system could also apply, but they would require slightly higher experience than the eight years required for government school teachers. It is a great move as the schools lacked leadership. It would help improve the atmosphere on campuses,” he said, while thanking the chief minister.Implementing the new process will require amending the regulations for school teachers that were announced just ahead of the assembly elections last year, which stipulated appointment of headmasters and head teachers through promotion of teachers fulfilling the required qualifications.Sanjay Kumar, principal secretary at the department of education, said it was a major policy decision. “The guidelines for the appointment of headmasters will be framed first. Later, we will change the regulations announced last year, which were for teachers appointed through panchayati raj institutions since 2006. Now, the cadre of headmasters and head teachers will be of the state level. All teachers could participate in the competition, subject to qualifications. Details will be published soon,” he said.At present, a large number of schools are without headmasters and the matter has been raised in the Bihar legislature time and again.The principal secretary said the cadre of headmasters for secondary schools will be at the divisional level and the one for head teachers for primary schools at the district level. “For high schools, those with requisite qualifications could participate in the competition even from outside the government school system. Those working with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) or Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CICSE) schools could also participate. The basic objective is to bring in quality people in schools,” he said.The move is in line with the Union ministry of Human Resource development’s suggestion last year to the states to consider filling 50% posts of headmasters in primary and upper primary schools through direct recruitment.The lack of quality education in government schools has often caused a lot of embarrassment despite growing enrolment, incentives and expenditure and even drawn flak from the Patna High Court.With the new move, the government, said a senior official, will provide a platform to meritorious teachers to excel and join the government cadre. A push for quality in educationCurrent processAs per new regulations announced just ahead of assembly polls last year, school heads are appointed through promotion of teachers fulfilling the required qualifications through panchayati raj institutions. New policyA separate cadre will be built for school heads, to be selected through a competitive exam, which will be open to teachers even outside the government school system. School heads will be govt employees. Centre’s nudgeThe move is in keeping with the Union HRD ministry’s suggestion last year to the states to consider filling 50% posts of headmasters in primary and upper primary schools through direct recruitment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cabinet-gives-nod-bihar-to-recruit-school-heads-through-bpsc-exam-101629260615096.html

18-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi weather: Wind pattern to change today, monsoon revival likely soon||High temperatures are likely to continue in Delhi on Wednesday, India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said. From Wednesday evening, however, wind patterns are expected to change and this will lead to the revival of monsoon from August 20, weathermen said.As the city is experiencing a “break monsoon” phase, the temperatures over the last week have been higher than usual. On Tuesday, the maximum temperature was 38 degrees Celsius, four degrees above what is considered normal for this time of the year.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, attributed the high temperatures in Delhi to this long period without rain. Also Read | Monsoon to revive over central and northwest India this week“Over the last few years, we have seen that the break monsoon conditions usually last for five to six days—maximum for a week. This time the period without rain is going to be around 10 days, which is a long time. This is causing temperatures to rise,” said Srivastava. Weather forecasters said that “break monsoon” conditions started in Delhi from August 9 and are likely to continue till August 19. This is among the longest “break monsoon” periods that the national capital has witnessed in at least the last decade, IMD officials said. IMD forecast also said that even after the monsoon revives, Delhi is only likely to receive moderate to light rain in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-weather-wind-pattern-to-change-today-monsoon-revival-likely-soon-101629254735070.html
18-08-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Portrait of a childhood||Anand is carrying a huge gunny sack on his back. “It looks heavy but is actually light,” he says. This evening, near Gurugram’s bus stand, Anand is collecting empty mineral water bottles from the pavements and garbage bins. “That’s my daily work.”Anand is about 8 or 9 years old, he says. He is wearing a blue T-shirt, blue shorts and yellow chappals. His hair is cut short. He is without a mask. His nose is partly dusted with mud. His face has the expressions of an adult man in the midst of an important assignment, with no moment to spare.Anand lives in a “jhuggi” near the railway station, with his parents and four siblings. He is the youngest. They all collect recyclable material at different but nearby locations in the city. “Papa leaves early in the morning, mummy leaves after some hours, with my brothers.” Anand leaves by early evening. These days, he says, he boards a shared auto towards this part of the town and spends a couple of hours picking bottles from the bins and pavements. “Earlier I was working in subzi mandi near the station.”Time moves fast at work, he says. “The bottles don’t ever get over. You keep spotting them and picking them up.” Usually his sack, huge as it is, gets quickly filled. “I carry three sacks, and I fill all of them within two hours.” He takes the catch back to home in a rickshaw, and his father sells it to a dealer the next morning. When he feels thirsty while hunting for bottles, stall owners in the vicinity give him cold drinks or mineral water on request, “for free.”People of Anand’s age attend school. Anand nods. “(A) didi sometimes teaches me in the park,” he says. He remains silent on what subjects are taught to him. “One day I will go to school.”Anand now walks towards a bin, beside a kiosk stocked with cold drinks. He places the sack he is carrying on the ground and bends down, sorting the discards in the bin with bare hands. Most are empty chip packets and tetra packs of juices. He eventually excavates two or three bottles that he swiftly puts inside the sack. He places the sack back on his shoulder and walks on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-portrait-of-a-childhood-101629251531858.html
18-08-2021||Delhi||Cops reject reports on electrocution||The Delhi police on Tuesday dismissed reports that the minor Dalit girl who was allegedly raped and murdered at a crematorium in the Purani Nangal village in south-west Delhi was not electrocuted.The police rubbished reports that appeared on social media on Tuesday, saying it was too early to conclusively say that the girl was not electrocuted, as mentioned in the FIR. Investigating officers said even though the water cooler had no current, the girl might have come into contact with a live wire near the appliance.One senior officer, privy to the case details, said police got the cooler checked by electricians to probe if she was electrocuted by the appliance. “There was no current in the cooler. But it is possible, she may have touched a live wire between the cooler and the main switch. It is too early to say that she did not die of electrocution,” the officer clarified.On the evening of August 1, the girl went to fetch water from the electric cooler installed at the crematorium. Around 6 pm, the priest and three male employees of the crematorium called the girl’s mother and informed her that her daughter has been electrocuted. The family told the police that the four men also showed burns on her body.When contacted, advocate Jitendra Kumar Jha, representing the nine-year-old girl’s family, said, “It is now for the investigating agency to tell as to how the death happened, if not by electrocution, as claimed in the FIR.”The accused allegedly told the child’s parents that it was better to cremate the body because if they informed the police the body would be sent for autopsy and the girl’s organs will be removed and sold by the doctors. The four then cremated the body. However, the girl’s mother suspected foul play and informed neighbours after which locals reached the crematorium; stopped the cremation and managed to retrieve charred remains of the girl’s body. The girl’s family then filed a complaint of rape and murder against the four suspects.The medical board, which conducted the autopsy on the charred remains of the girl’s body, could not confirm if the child was raped.Police said they would mention all this details in the charge sheet against the four men.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cops-reject-reports-on-electrocution-101629251140150.html
18-08-2021||Delhi||BJP slams Rahul over photo of Dalit rape victim’s family||The Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday accused former Congress president Rahul Gandhi of lying to the country after the mother of the nine-year-old Dalit girl, who was allegedly raped and murdered in Delhi on August 1, told a news channel in an interview that the family didn’t give Gandhi consent to share any photographs of their meeting.The Wayanad MP had on August 4 tweeted a photograph of his meeting the family of the victim, following which there was a complaint against him filed by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR). His Twitter account was locked for a few days and the controversial tweet withheld even as the BJP accused him and his party of politicising the matter.Twitter unlocked his account on August 14 after he submitted a consent letter by the parents of the victim, authorising him to use the image.A day earlier, on August 13, the victim’s family was also heard telling news media that they had no objection to Gandhi sharing their photograph on social media as he did that in good faith.But on Tuesday, the mother of the victim said something different to news channel Times Now. “We have not given consent to share the photos or reveal her (the victim) identity to anyone except the court,” the mother said.Following this, the BJP launched a fresh attack on Gandhi, calling him “insensitive”, and demanded that his Twitter account be locked again. “Rahul Gandhi has lost credibility and is a habitual liar. The public has locked his political account, now Twitter should also lock his account,” party spokesperson Sambit Patra said.Union minister for women and child development, Smriti Irani, joined in the tirade on Twitter: “That he lacks sensitivity, disrespects the law and lies on important issues was well known but using a child’s parents to score a political point over a rape crime is indicative of a depraved mindset. The former Congress President is beyond redemption.”Twitter said the controversial tweet will remain withheld in India in compliance with local laws and its own terms of service, but reiterated that its decision to unlock Gandhi’s account was taken after its grievance channel in India went through the formal consent letter signed by the family.Suresh Chaudhary, a lawyer representing the victim’s parents, said his clients hold a “neutral position” on the issue of sharing their images. “My clients have told me that they neither gave any written consent (to share their photograph), nor have they submitted any complaint in this connection,” said Chaudhary.He further said that his clients are people who have little knowledge of social media or such consent. “They don’t even own a mobile phone. What would they understand about Twitter and Facebook?” said Chaudhary.But a Congress functionary familiar with the matter said the family’s claim contradicts their previous claim. “In an earlier interview with India Today, the family said they had no objection to the photograph being shared,” the functionary said, requesting anonymity. “The fact that so many senior BJP leaders have made statements show how scared the party is of Rahul Gandhi.”The functionary added that since August 4, when Gandhi’s Twitter account was locked over the post, he has refrained from posting on the microblogging platform. “He’s basically disappointed that the government of the day pressures private companies to interfere in the internal polity of the country,” the functionary said. “He has strong opinions on the way the social media entities are becoming monopolistic and overbearing.”But an NCPCR official said the consent of the family is irrelevant in the case as the victim was a minor. “Only a sessions court judge can grant permission to allow the disclosure of information that can lead to the identification of the victim,” the official said, requesting anonymity.NCPCR has already moved the Delhi high court over the incident. But on Tuesday, it asked social media giant Facebook to explain why a similar post by Rahul Gandhi made on its sister platform, Instagram, was still up. The post was a video shared by the Congress leader of his meeting with the family. The Commission exempted the social media company from appearing at the hearing on Tuesday, stating that it will share its order regarding the response in due course.Facebook reacted by sending Gandhi an email (seen by HT), asking him to take down the post “expeditiously” as the NCPCR has alerted the company that it is in violation of Indian law.People familiar with the matter said that the company was constructively engaging with NCPCR to address the issue. According to Facebook’s policies, if a post violates its community standards or local law, then the company can either notify the user to remove it or proactively block it.Congress had said last week that nearly 5,000 Twitter accounts, including those of several senior Congress leaders and the party’s official handle, were temporarily locked on Thursday after they shared a photograph of Rahul Gandhi meeting the rape victim’s family even as the party mounted an attack on the central government for scuttling free speech. The microblogging platform, however, maintained that it “impartially” enforces its rules and terms of service.Gandhi’s controversial tweet was in Hindi in which he had said, “Parents’ tears are saying only one thing—their daughter, the daughter of this country, deserves justice. And I am with them on this path to justice.”The child rights body said the tweet violated the Juvenile Justice Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bjp-slams-rahul-over-photo-of-dalit-rape-victim-s-family-101629250461946.html

18-08-2021||Delhi||‘Gambhir got Covid meds for health camp that never was’||At the peak of the second wave of Covid-19 in Delhi, with cases soaring to almost 20,000 a day, and people scrambling for oxygen, beds, and essential medicines, the Gautam Gambhir Foundation used “one letter” to purchase at least 2,500 strips of Fabiflu for a “free medical camp” that never happened, according to an inquiry conducted by the state Drug Controller (DC).While the state government has already informed the Delhi high court that it will not continue its investigation against individuals, social organisations and gurdwaras for procuring oxygen and supplying it free to the people, the former cricketer-turned-east Delhi member of Parliament from the Bharatiya Janata Party is still being investigated for allegedly hoarding the medicines. The high court remarked during a hearing on July 29 that Gambhir “irresponsibly hoarded” the medicines while citizens did not have access to it because of the shortage.Gautam Gambir’s office said they will not comment on it as the matter is being heard by the court.On April 21, Gambhir tweeted asking “people of East Delhi” to come to his office at 2, Jagriti Enclave if they wanted “Fabiflu for Free.”The Drug Controller has said that the parliamentarian’s foundation is liable for prosecution as it did not have the requisite drug licence under the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, for purchase, stocking or distribution of drugs. The DC has mentioned this in their action taken report submitted to the court, according to officials privy to the details.On July 17 , the Drug Controller informed the high court that they suspended the licence of four chemists for 10 days for supplying the medicine to the foundation.A team of four officials from the Drug Controller’s office, which conducted the inquiry, also found that some chemists supplied more than half their stock to the foundation.Sample this. The DC questioned Vinay Kumar Ahuja, proprietor of M/S New Sanjeevani Chemist located in Daryaganj, who confirmed that he supplied 1,000 strips of Favipiravir tablets (Fabiflu) vide invoice 0000407 against a purchase order of Gautam Gambhir Foundation and received ₹12,39,997 after which he was left with only 875 strips.“The state government had already suspended our licence for 10 days in the case. Even after supplying the medicines, we had enough stock left,” Ahuja said.Harshit Ahuja (no relation), proprietor of M/S Ahujason located in Patel Nagar, central Delhi was also questioned by the Drug Controller. The officials said Ahuja confirmed that he supplied 500 strips of Favipir tablets vide invoice 0000729 on April 29 and another 100 strips vide invoice 0000730 on April 26, against a payment of ₹9.90 lakh and ₹1.10 lakh. According to a stock statement he provided to the Drug Controller authorities, he had only 100 strips of the medicine.Ahuja declined comment.A third chemist, Medical Bureau, located at Bhagirath Palace, supplied 800 strips of the medicine but was left with 1244 strips. A person who answered the call at Medical Bureau said the proprietor Lakshay Kumar would respond. Till late Tuesday evening, there was no response from him.The details of the stock remaining with the fourth chemist, Neelkant, the Medicine People at Saini Enclave, were not shared with the DC. This chemist supplied the foundation 243 strips.To be sure, the DC noted in its report submitted to the court that “the dealers from whom this medicine was procured had sufficient balance stock in hand to supply to other retailers.”In April and May, Delhi police arrested at least 150 persons for hoarding and black marketing Covid-19 medicines such as remdesivir injections, oxygen cylinders and Favipiravir tablets. Police have not provided specific data mentioning how many of the 150 persons hoarded Favipiravir.The probe against Gambhir was launched on the basis of a Public Interest Litigation filed in the high court by a city resident.The PIL alleged that while common people were not able to access the medicines, many politicians including Gambhir were hoarding them. Other politicians such as BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana, Congress youth vice-president BV Srinivas and former Congress MLA Mukesh Sharma were given a clean chit, but the DC said that Gambhir procured the medicines in bulk for distribution on a “single letter.”According to the DC, the Gautam Gambhir Foundation requested a city hospital to organise a medical camp for Covid-19 patients and wrote a letter to this effect on April 18. One of the doctors of the hospital wrote back, saying he had been deputed to supervise the medical camp.The doctor suggested the medicines to be prescribed in the letter, following which the foundation placed orders. Based on this one letter, the foundation procured 2,634 strips of medicine, the DC found.HT is withholding the name of the hospital and the doctor as the Drug Controller has confirmed that neither were involved in purchasing or hoarding the medicines.Interestingly, the camp never happened.The Drug Controller questioned Gautam Gambhir Foundation’s CEO, Aparajita Singh, who confirmed that the foundation on April 15 passed a resolution to hold a medical camp at 22, Pusa Road New Delhi. Singh also confirmed that based on a letter from the hospital on the medicines that would be needed, she placed orders to buy Favipiravir tablets on behalf of the foundation. Singh also told the inquiry officials that while they intended to have the medical camp at the Pusa Road office, they never did so.Neither Singh nor Gambhir in their statement mentioned why the medical camp was not held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gambhir-got-covid-meds-for-health-camp-that-never-was-101629248246117.html
18-08-2021||Delhi||9 names cleared, India may get 1st woman CJI in ’27||India may get its first woman Chief Justice of India (CJI) in 2027.The Supreme Court collegium on Tuesday cleared nine names for appointments in the top court, including the name of justice BV Nagarathna from the Karnataka high court (HC), who, if elevated now, could become the country’s first woman CJI in 2027.According to the people familiar with the development, the other names cleared by the collegium include two more women judges and one direct appointment from the Supreme Court bar.Apart from justice Nagarathna, the other two women judges picked by the five-member collegium are justice Hima Kohli, who is the chief justice of Telangana HC, and justice Bela Trivedi, who is a judge in the Gujarat HC.Senior advocate PS Narasimha is the collegium’s choice for direct appointment to the bench. Narasimha’s recommendation comes less than a week after the retirement of justice Rohinton F Nariman, who happened to be only the fifth lawyer in India’s legal history to be directly appointed from the bar.Those in the know of the development told HT that the other names finalised by the collegium include justices Abhay Shreeniwas Oka (chief justice of Karnataka HC), Vikram Nath (chief justice of Gujarat HC), Jitendra Kumar Maheshwari (chief justice of Sikkim HC), CT Ravikumar (judge in Kerala HC) and MM Sundresh (judge in Kerala HC).Three out of these nine judges can become the CJI during their tenure at the apex court, including justice Nagarathna who could be the CJI in 2027 for little over a month.The collegium in the Supreme Court comprised CJI NV Ramana, and justices Uday U Lalit, AM Khanwilkar, Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao.It was the first collegium in the last 21 months when the five most senior judges could arrive at a consensus in forwarding names to the Union government for appointments in the top court.Since the retirement of Justice Ranjan Gogoi as the CJI in November 2019, the collegium had not sent a single recommendation to the Union government for appointments in the top court, which currently has nine vacancies after justice Nariman’s exit on August 12.Additionally, Justice Navin Sinha is set to retire on August 18, which will leave the Supreme Court with 10 vacancies out of 34. Out of these 10 vacancies, nine names have now been zeroed in by the collegium.As reported by HT on February 21, the impasse in the collegium, according to the people familiar with the development, persisted due to justice Nariman’s firm stand over recommending justice Akil A Kureshi, currently chief justice of the Tripura high court, as a judge in the apex court.Justice Nariman had asserted that any recommendation to be made by the collegium of the five most senior judges must include justice Kureshi, who stood at number 2 in all-India seniority list of high court judges. A lack of consensus within the collegium stalled appointment of judges in the top court ever since.The previous CJI SA Bobde’s 17-month tenure turned out to be the only one in judicial history when a CJI demitted office without making any recommendation for the Supreme Court after the advent of the collegium system in 1990s.Both justices Bobde and Nariman had, however, at different platform had said that it is time for the country to have its first woman CJI.The Supreme Court currently has only one woman judge, justice Indira Banerjee, who is set to retire in September 2022. There have only been eight women judges appointed in the Supreme Court till date.The recommendations will be sent to the Union law ministry that has the option of sending the recommendations back to the collegium for review, but if the collegium resubmits them, it has to approve the names.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/9-names-cleared-india-may-get-1st-woman-cji-in-27-101629246837628.html

The drive announced by mayor Balkar Sandhu was conducted only for two days and has been put on halt since then. The trade and use of plastic carry bags continues at every nook and corner of the city as the civic authorities have failed to rein in on the violators of the ban that was imposed in 2016. After the MC team confiscated over 12.5 quintals of plastic bags and issued challans to the tune of ₹2 lakh to traders in different parts of the city within two days of the beginning of the drive, a delegation of plastic manufacturers and traders had met Mayor Sandhu on August 4, seeking permission to deal in plastic bags of width upto 50 microns and above, as allowed by the union government. A controversy had also erupted after MC secretary Jasdev Sekhon, the in-charge of the 13-member special team formed for imposing the ban, was transferred to Abohar just four days after the drive started. MC employees’ union had also opposed the transfer, suspecting it to be punishment for tightening the noose around the violators. At the time, mayor Sandhu had stated that the transfer has been done at the state-level and the drive will continue with some other official at the helm. But no raids were conducted in the city after that. An MC official, requesting anonymity, said the transfer has been put on halt due to the resentment shown by the employees union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-mc-s-drive-against-plastic-bags-proves-a-damp-squib-101629238837753.html

Meanwhile, police were called to ensure the safety of the officials against whom the protest was being staged. “There was no need to call the police since we were protesting peacefully. Moreover, the authorities have provoked other union leaders against us and adopted divide and rule policy. We ended the protest after we were assured that transfers will be reconsidered,” Avtar added.

Senior vice-president of the association, Harmeet Batra said the industry has been demanding a relief as the imposition of a complete ban would have robbed the livelihood of hundreds of traders and manufacturers, who are already reeling under losses due to the ongoing pandemic.He said, “We have been demanding permission to deal in 50 micron bags for a long time as the Centre has also permitted the same. The mayor has accepted our demand and we have also asked our members to avoid dealing in banned bags with width less than 50 micron.” The industry’s representatives also stated that they are willing to work with the civic body to manage the waste in the city.An MC official, requesting anonymity, revealed that the civic body has been forced to go easy on the ban due to the upcoming Vidhan Sabha elections. Further, MC officials are also finding it difficult to measure the width of bags during the raids due to lack of proper equipment.Mayor Sandhu said, “The decision has been taken after the union government allowed plastic carry bags of width up to 50 micron and above. Temporary relief has been given citing the upcoming festival season. The civic body will continue to take action against traders and residents dealing in plastic bags of width less than 50 microns.” Earlier on July 21, the mayor had announced a massive drive to impose the ban on plastic carry bags, stating that apart from creating pollution, dumping of plastic waste also chokes the sewer lines.

Police recently recovered a cache of weapons from the members of both gangs, which led them to suspect they were conspiring to harm the rivals. The two groups are known to have got into a clash in June, in which they attacked each other with iron rods, sticks and sharp-edged weapons. Now that the two gangs are armed with weapons, cops fear the situation may worsen. Further, some members of the two gangs, who are already in police custody, are said to have made startling revelations that led the police to increase their vigil. The Ludhiana police have recovered three illegal weapons from the gang members. On the other hand, their counterparts in Delhi seized 13 weapons from the possession of Karanbir Singh alias Karan Walia, a member of the Shubham Mota gang. He was brought to Ludhiana on production warrant from Tihar jail in Delhi on August 7. Cops had recently brought Rishab Benipal of the Shubham Mota gang on production warrant from Faridkot Jail and recovered a .32 bore pistol following the information provided by him. According to police, Benipal was running the gang from inside the jail. Earlier on August 13, police had arrested Naveen alias Negi of Geeta Nagar of Tajpur road from a farmhouse in Jhande village. Negi is known to be a close aide of Puneet Bains. Police recovered two illegal pistols from his possession.

In June, 161 such offenders were caught fined ₹94,105 in all. Railway officials attribute this increase in ticket violations to the unavailability of ticket-window facility at the station.Anil Kumar, inspector, Railway Protection Force, said, “As of now, ticket counters are not operational at the Ludhiana railway station, due to social distancing considerations. So right now, only people with online reservations are able to travel. This may be the reason for increased ticket violations.” He added that the number of persons caught travelling without tickets has increased over the past few days as more and more trains hit the track. Another official added, “We found that people were buying platform tickets, which are available at the counters, and boarding the trains. When our teams caught them, they claimed that they had just come to drop someone. After observing this trend, we started sending more teams inside trains to check for ticket offenders.”Officials said most of the ticket offenders were found travelling to Bihar or Uttar Pradesh. “Our teams conducting special drives to nab the offenders,” said inspector Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/as-train-services-get-back-on-track-ludhiana-sees-rise-in-ticket-violators-101629229839820.html

18-08-2021||Chandigarh||JCT Electronics’ plot sale: BJP leader Sud seeks minister Arora’s resignation||Senior BJP leader and former Punjab minister Tikshan Sud on Tuesday demanded the resignation of industries minister Sundar Sham Arora and that he should not occupy the ministerial berth till the time Lokpal completes an inquiry into the sale of liquidated JCT Electronics’ 32-acre commercial plot in Mohali to a realty firm. Addressing a press conference in Chandigarh, Sud said Arora was a shareholder in the realty company, GRG Developers and Coloniser, which bought the controversial plot. “We have given all documents in this regard to the Lokpal, which has already asked Arora to appear in person on October 12. We demand that till this probe is completed, Arora should stay away from the cabinet otherwise as a minister, he can influence the probe or manipulate the evidence,” Sud said. The former minister also alleged that the industries minister also extended undue favour to Gulmohar Township India Pvt. Ltd. that bought a 27-acre piece of land and sold it further by dividing it into 125 small plots. “The sale of plots without the approval of PUDA and RERA has caused a loss of ₹500 crore to the exchequer,” Sud said. However, the industries department has refuted all allegations regarding the sale of plots by Gulmohar Township. “The allegations of undue favour and financial loss to the exchequer are completely unfounded and not based on facts,” a spokesperson of the department said in a press statement. He clarified that Punjab State Industrial Development Corporation (PSIDC) had sold Plot No 1 (25 acres) in Phase 9, Mohali, as a freehold property in 1984 and the sale deed was executed in 1987 between the PSIDC and Punjab Anand Labs India Ltd. Thereafter, as per orders of the court and following due process of law, the said plot was transferred in the name of Signify Innovations India Ltd, which applied for the no objection certificate (NOC) to sell off the freehold property in favour of s Gulmohar Township India Pvt. Ltd. in November 2020. The PSIDC as per procedure issued the NOC and Gulmohar Township applied before PSIEC for fragmentation of 25-acre land into 125 plots as per the standard policy applicable across Punjab, the spokesperson said. “Sud is frustrated these days as I had defeated him twice in elections. He has also lost support in Hoshiarpur which was evident when his wife lost the councillor’s election. He held press conferences with the same documents, first in Hoshiarpur, then in Jalandhar and now in Chandigarh,” said Arora.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jct-electronics-plot-sale-bjp-leader-sud-seeks-minister-arora-s-resignation-101629229722441.html
18-08-2021||Delhi||Unusual dry spell driving up deficit, discomfort: IMD||The second of the so-called break-monsoon phases has left the country with a 9% deficiency in total monsoon rainfall till August 16, although the India Meteorological Department expects rainfall to resume from later this week.Meanwhile, the national capital, where it last rained on August 9, is unlikely to see a resumption till August 19 — making it among the longest break-monsoon phases the city has seen, IMD officials said. The result: high temperatures; for instance, Tuesday’s maximum, at 38 degrees Celsius was a full four degrees above normal. Delhi at present is receiving hot and dry winds from the north-west. This is also causing the temperatures to rise, Met officials said.August has seen poor rain across India: a 33% overall deficiency in rainfall; a 51% deficiency over central India; a 22% deficiency over northwest India; a 37.7% deficiency over peninsular India; and a 5% deficiency over east and north-east India.This has worsened the overall statistics too. Cumulative rainfall between June 1 and August 16 has seen a 9% deficiency over the entire country; 8% deficiency over north-west India; 11% deficiency over east and north-east India; and 13% deficiency over central India . Only the southern peninsula is in the green — with 5% excess rainfall.Delhi has seen a 58% deficiency in rainfall in August and a 9% surplus overall (from June 1 to August 17).To be sure, rainfall that is plus-or-minus 20% of the long period average is considered normal.According to weather experts, break monsoon is a phase during the southwest monsoon when there is a break in the monsoon showers. This pause could last a couple of days, going up to a fortnight.While rainfall decreases in parts of north, north-west and central India, this weather phenomenon results in an increase in showers along the Himalayan foothills, in north-east India and also along the southern peninsula.Met officials added that this long dry spell is the primary reason behind Delhi witnessing high temperatures, which is unlikely for this time of the year.“Over the last few years, we have seen that the break monsoon conditions usually last for five to six days—maximum for a week. This time, the period without rain is going to be around 10 days, which is a long time. This is causing temperatures to rise,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.This is the second major break in this monsoon; the first one was between June 29 and July 11.However, IMD officials expect monsoon rain to resume by Wednesday or Thursday. “There was a long break phase in July also. But now there is a new monsoon pulse over southern peninsula which will move upwards gradually. A low-pressure area which has formed over northwest Bay of Bengal will also bring rain in its path,” said DS Pai, senior scientist at IMD Pune.“With the movement of the low pressure system, we are expecting rains to commence over central India, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, etc, and then over parts of north-west India from August 19. Easterly winds at lower levels have started picking up over some parts of north-west India,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre, IMD.It isn’t clear whether the revival will see the deficit being made up.“Rains during the second half may help cover the rain deficiency during monsoon season,” said Pai but Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet Weather Services, a private weather forecasting agency, said the forecast only suggests moderate to light rain. “But the forecast after August 19 is of moderate to light rains. It will only increase the count, it will not be beneficial to the city. Short and intense showers only result in flooding, the rain water doesn’t get absorbed into the ground as it should,” added Palawat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/unusual-dry-spell-driving-up-deficit-discomfort-imd-101629229275005.html
18-08-2021||Chandigarh||Pargat Singh takes charge as Punjab Congress gen secy||Congress MLA Pargat Singh on Tuesday assumed charge as the general secretary of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC). The two-time Jalandhar Cantonment MLA took charge of his new assignment in the presence of Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu and several ministers and legislators at Punjab Congress Bhawan here. Sidhu had on Monday named his close confidant Pargat as the general secretary (organisation) of the state unit. Pargat said that it was a big responsibility, and he would take everyone in the party along. “Punjab has lots of expectations from us. I have told all senior ministers and MLAs that there is a gap due to pending promises. We will work together to fill this gap before going into the elections,” the Jalandhar Cantonment MLA said, stressing the need to make the administration accountable to the legislators. Sidhu, who also spoke on the occasion, said that Pargat was a legend and a team player who would take everyone along. “We will consult everyone before any decision is taken. No decision will be imposed,” he said. Cabinet ministers Sukhjinder Randhawa, Tript Rajinder Bajwa and Bharat Bhushan Ashu, working presidents Sukhwinder Singh Danny, Kuljit Singh Nagra, Sangat Singh Gilzian and Pawan Goyal, MP Dr Amar Singh and MLA Kulbir Singh Zira, Madanlal Jalalpur, Harjot Kanwal, Angad Saini and Barindermeet Pahra were among those present. Sandeep Sandhu, political adviser to chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, was also present. In May, Pargat had accused Sandhu of threatening him for questioning the state government on the sacrilege and police firing cases. Pargat, who had jumped ship from the SAD to the Congress in 2016, has been critical of the chief minister for the past more than two years, questioning the state government’s failure to fulfil key poll promises. Later, Sidhu also met Meritorious School Teachers’ Union, Old Pension Restoration Union, Sarpanch Union and members of electricity board who submitted their representations to him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pargat-singh-takes-charge-as-punjab-congress-gen-secy-101629229541206.html
18-08-2021||Mumbai||Aaditya Thackeray meets Afghan students, says he will convey their concerns to Centre||As Afghanistan was taken over by Taliban, students from the country who are studying in Maharashtra are in fear for their life. They are concerned about their stay in the state as some of their visas are about to expire and they want to extend the same. Many of them also want asylum in India.A delegation of Afghan students met with Maharashtra protocol and environment minister Aaditya Thackeray on Tuesday, who assured them of full cooperation. He also assured them that students are safe in the state. Thackeray said they would convey the concerns raised by the Afghan students to the Central government as the state government.There are around 4,000-4,500 Afghan students studying in different parts of the state.“There are several issues that have concerned the students from Afghanistan, who have come to Maharashtra for studies. They want to know how they can continue to stay here as the visas of some of them are about to expire as their graduation is about to complete while others have a few years in hand. They are concerned about their return. Some of them also want to take asylum in the country. I will convey all their concerns and requests to the Centre as the state government has limited jurisdiction in the matter of foreign affairs,” Thackeray said, after his meeting with Afghan students at Sahyadri guest house at Malabar Hill on Tuesday afternoon.“It was necessary to hear their concerns and assure them that till they are in Maharashtra, they do not have to fear. They are safe and will not have to face any difficulty. We will take care of them. This is what I have assured them today,” he added.The state protocol minister, however, refused to comment on the Taliban and their taking over of the country by force. “I cannot speak on what is happening in Afghanistan as it would be better if it remains between the two countries (India and Afghanistan),” he commended, in response to a question.A student, who was part of the delegation, said they feared they would be killed if returned to Afghanistan. “It is unfortunate that the Taliban has taken over our country. We are afraid that our lives will be in danger if we go back to Afghanistan. We are unable to contact our families as there is no power supply. Mobile towers have been destroyed. We have come to meet Aaditya Thackeray ji to express our concerns,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/aaditya-thackeray-meets-afghan-students-says-he-will-convey-their-concerns-to-centre-101629229540103.html
18-08-2021||Chandigarh||On poll trail, Sukhbir Badal kicks off 100-day yatra to 100 Punjab assembly segments||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal announced to start a 100-day yatra in as many assembly constituencies of Punjab from Wednesday to reach out to all sections of society, including farmers, businessmen, youth, women, Dalits and the backward classes. At least 700 public meetings will be held during the yatra that will start from the Zira segment, he said. Addressing a press conference in Chandigarh, the former Punjab deputy chief minister released a 132-page chargesheets against the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) governments in Punjab and Delhi accusing them of “failing the aspirations” of the people of the two states. “I will meet people to know about their grievances and expose the corrupt Congress government and its council of ministers. We will also formulate a strategy if we form government in Punjab with our coalition partner Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). Launching the ‘gall Punjab di’ (talk about Punjab) campaign, Sukhbir said he and his party workers will go to each and every village and ward in the state to collect feedback from people. The SAD president said chief minister Amarinder Singh had a lot to answer with regards to the ₹6,500 crore excise scam as five of his ministerial colleagues were accused of indulging in corruption. He alleged, “Sadhu Singh Dharamsot was involved in the SC scholarship scam, Sukhjinder Randhawa was involved in the seed scam, Balbir Sidhu in the Covid procurement as well as de-addiction tablet scam, Bharat Bhushan Ashu in the wheat scam and Shyam Sunder Arora in the JCT land scam.” The ministers have already rejected these allegations. It was a misfortune of Punjab to have a CM who did not venture out of his house, did not meet even his ministers and does not listen to people, he said, adding that teachers seeking to meet him were thrashed brutally.“No development was carried out during his tenure, but gangsters have been patronised in jails to run extortion rackets,” he alleged. “Similarly, AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal swore by his children not to have any alliance with the Congress but broke it within days,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/on-poll-trail-sukhbir-badal-kicks-off-100-day-yatra-to-100-punjab-assembly-segments-101629229481422.html
18-08-2021||Chandigarh||Congress infighting: Not ‘fully satisfied’ with situation, Harish Rawat to visit Punjab next week||As the battle of wits continues between newly appointed Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu and chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat on Tuesday said that he is not fully satisfied with the goings-on in the state. Rawat, who has been asked by Congress president Sonia Gandhi to mediate between Sidhu and Amarinder for unity in the party, said that both leaders had shown due deference to the party leadership and should work together. “I am not fully satisfied (with the present situation). There is need for humility from the PCC president. Capt also showed large-heartedness and needs to continue with that,” he told Hindustan Times. The AICC general secretary said there were reports of action against someone or reluctance to accept a suggestion from someone else (in the party). “These are small things and do not match the persona of Capt Saab,” he said, refusing to go into specifics. Rawat said he would visit Chandigarh early next week, most probably on Monday and Tuesday, to talk to both leaders. The one-upmanship between Sidhu and Amarinder, who are not on the same page on several issues, particularly some unfulfilled poll promises, has left the state Congress a divided house. Sidhu and other Capt-baiters, who have rallied behind him, continue to question the state government on the 18-point agenda handed to the chief minister by the Congress high command for implementation before the state elections. Amarinder, who is also making countermoves albeit quietly to corner some of his detractors, had, in his meeting with Sonia last week, told her that continued and repeated targeting of the state government would be detrimental to the party. Rawat, who was also present, later told reporters the Congress president had asked him to ensure that both (Amarinder and Sidhu) worked within their respective limits and cooperated with each other. On lack of coordination and public questioning of the government by the Punjab Congress leadership on pending poll promises, Rawat said that the state unit was free to give its suggestions and the government had to see if it could be done. “In case of faulty power purchase agreements, two-three of them should be cancelled. If needed, the state assembly’s view can be taken,” he said. About the controversy over the statements made by Malwinder Singh Mali, one of Sidhu’s three advisers, the Punjab affairs in-charge said it was the state president’s prerogative to choose his advisers. “I have not seen his (Mali’s) statements, but no one should cross the line. If I come across something, I will take a strong note,” he said. On the party’s organisational set-up, he said the party had set the ball rolling and would make a few more appointments in next two-three days. “A panel of spokespersons will be named followed by the constitution of the state committee and finally the district and block Congress committees,” he said. The state unit was disbanded by the Congress president in January 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-infighting-not-fully-satisfied-with-situation-harish-rawat-to-visit-punjab-next-week-101629229479774.html
18-08-2021||Chandigarh||Hiring of 981 regular lecturers at govt colleges hits hurdle as file stuck with PPSC||Initiated after a long hiatus of 19 years, the process of hiring 931 lecturers, or assistant professors, on a regular basis at 48 government colleges in the state has hit a stumbling block as the file related to the recruitment is lying with the Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC) for five months. The file has not been cleared due to delay on part of the state government in appointing the commission chairman after Lt Gen Surinder Singh (retd) retired from the post in early July. According to the rule, only the chairman is authorised to give approvals for issuing advertisements on hiring by various government departments.The state department of higher education had submitted the file with the commission in April after completing all the formalities. Director of public instructions (DPI colleges) Paramjit Singh said there is no delay on their part as the department is waiting for the nod from the commission. “We are hopeful that the file will be cleared and advertisement will be issued thereafter,” he said.The recruitment of college lecturers on a regular basis in Punjab was done last in 2002 when the vigilance bureau busted a cash-for-job scam. The recruitments remained stalled for a long time as the matter was sub judice. In Punjab, there are 1,873 sanctioned posts of lecturers, of which 1,292 are laying vacant. To overcome the staff shortage, the department has roped in 882 guest faculty and 251 part-time lecturers.Guest faculty demands relaxationThe guest faculty and 251 part-time lecturers at government colleges are uncertain about their jobs as the process of appointment of regular assistant professors has kickstarted.They have urged the state government to give relaxations in the recruitment process so that their jobs could be regularised. Deepak Kaushal, member of the Guest Faculty Assistant Professors’ Association, said with less than 70% regular lecturers in government colleges, the guest faculty forms the backbone of these institutions. “We want relaxation in age bar as 50% guest lecturers have crossed the age limit to apply for other government jobs,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hiring-of-981-regular-lecturers-at-govt-colleges-hits-hurdle-as-file-stuck-with-ppsc-101629229419678.html
18-08-2021||Mumbai||ED attaches properties worth ₹234 crore of former MLA Vivekanand Patil||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) attached immovable properties worth ₹234 crore of Vivekanand Shankar Patil, a former member of legislative assembly (MLA) and former chairman of Karnala Nagari Sahakari Bank Limited, in connection with an alleged fraud of around ₹560 crore. The attached properties include Karnala sports academy and several land parcels.ED arrested Patil in June in the case and filed a charge sheet on August 12. Patil is a four-term MLA from Panvel constituency from Peasants and Workers Party of India and was chairman of the bank, which has its headquarters in Panvel. The probing agency started the investigation on the basis of case registered by the economic offences wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police in 2019. The fraud came to light after an audit was done at the instance of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2019-20, when it was revealed that Patil was siphoning funds from the bank through 63 fictitious loan accounts to Karnala Charitable Trust and Karnala Sports Academy, which were founded and controlled by Patil, said an ED officer.In March 2019, RBI had flagged 58 suspicious accounts in the bank and instructed the Commissioner for Cooperation and Registrar, Cooperative Societies (CC and RCS) to look into the accounts. The special audit was initiated by a government auditor who submitted his report to CC and RCS, Maharashtra. As the audit report revealed that since 2013, Patil allegedly created several fake bank accounts to facilitate at least 63 loans to bogus firms and persons without any valid documentation, a case was lodged.As per the complaint, the accounts which were granted loans were either of Patil’s close friends or relatives. The loan limit to these accounts was increased gradually and the sanctioned loan amount was diverted to Karnala Charitable Trust and Karnala Sports Academy. Investigations under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) revealed that the defrauded amount was to the tune of approximately ₹560 crore including interest. These funds were utilised by Karnala Charitable Trust, Karnala Sports Academy and others for construction of properties such as sports complex, college and schools and for other personal gains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ed-attaches-properties-worth-234-crore-of-former-mla-vivekanand-patil-101629229359783.html

Led by leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema, the AAP delegation submitted a memorandum to the speaker, opposing the present policy under which a member is entitled to pension for each term. The party delegation included Kultar Singh Sandhwan, Budh Ram, Meet Hayer, Manjit Singh Bilaspur, Kulwant Pandori, Jai Singh Rodi and Amarjit Singh Sandoa, all first-time legislators. The AAP MLAs, in their memorandum, opposed more than one monthly pension for MLAs who have been elected to the state assembly more than once, stating that such financial gain in the name of increments was “morally and theoretically wrong”. “A legislator should be given the same pension no matter if he had become MLA more than once,” they said. Cheema said the Amarinder Singh-led Congress government had stopped the pensions of Punjab government employees in the name of reforms in 2004, which was strongly opposed by the entire employees and pensioners community. “The delegation demanded that in the forthcoming assembly session, a law should be passed with the consent of all the MLAs to abolish more than one pension rule and restore the old pension scheme for government employees,” he said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aap-demands-one-pension-rule-for-mlas-101629229180371.html

But the 25 kilometre commute to the civil hospital proved too long as our child died on the way,” he said. He added, “Had the operation theatre at the Dehlon centre been functional, our child could have been saved.”When contacted, civil surgeon Dr Kiran Ahluwalia said all arrangements have been made for safe childbirth at the community health centre in Dehlon. “The condition of that particular patient was critical. So she had to be rushed to the civil hospital. While the child could not be saved, the mother is stable.”The foundation stone for the Dehlon community health centre was laid on 2011 but it was not until 2016 that the construction work finally kicked off. Though the spick and span entrance gives an impression of a fully functional health centre, only two rooms on the ground floor and five rooms for doctors are in a good state. The rest of the building paints a picture of bureaucratic neglect. Several rooms in the building have not even been whitewashed and the passage leading to the first floor isn’t yet to be electrified. Dr Ahluwalia said, “Due to Covid outbreak, many projects had come to a halt. But now work has resumed and soon all buildings will be fully functional. The remaining part of the building will soon be completed. We are also hiring more staff and doctors to meet the shortage of manpower.”Another project in the balanceA 10-bed urban community health centre that was thrown open for the public at the civil surgeon’s office in 2019 is also yet to be operationalised due to lack of doctors and staff. It is currently being used as the Covid vaccination centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/poor-infra-at-dehlon-chc-woman-delivers-stillborn-on-way-to-ludhiana-civil-hospital-101629229061028.html
18-08-2021||Mumbai||Cop in Arnala patrols 12-km stretch of beaches near Mumbai on horse||A senior officer with the Arnala Coastal police station has to ride a horse every weekend to patrol the 12-km stretch beaches in Arnala, Navapur, Bhuigaon, Kalamb, Rajodi, Rangaon, Suruchibaug and other areas. The horse has been rented from owners who use them for joy rides at the beach.Senior inspector (crime) Amar Patil hires the horse for ₹300 for an eight-hour shift every weekend and on holidays when the crowds arrive at the beach. “As joy rides on horse carts are banned on the beach due to Covid-19, the horse owners are facing financially difficulties. So it was decided to pay for hiring the horses,” said Patil. “We do have a jeep for patrolling but cannot use it on the beach as the wheels get stuck on the sandy soil. So a horse comes in handy as they have strong flattened hooves and can even wade through waist deep water, and their feet also do not get stuck on sandy soil,” said Patil. Mumbai Police in June had received around 10 all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) to patrol beaches, but the newly formed Mira Bhayander Vasai Virar (MBVV) Commissionerate does not have such ATVs though the Vasai-Virar stretch has a long beach line. Thus, horses come in handy for beach patrolling, said Patil.“When I was earlier posted in Mumbai Police, I had learnt horse riding as a hobby. Now I am putting it to practice to nab the violators. This month alone, we have managed to rescue 14 drunk revellers from drowning and also booked around 60 tourists for Covid-19 violation by mounted patrolling,” said Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cop-in-arnala-patrols-12-km-stretch-of-beaches-near-mumbai-on-horse-101629229059636.html
18-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra breaches 6.4 million mark of Covid-19 cases; rise in delta plus cases a cause of worry||With 4,408 fresh infections, Maharashtra crossed the 6.4 million mark of Covid-19 cases on Tuesday. The state’s tally stood at 6,401,213. The tally of active cases also reduced to 61,306 as 5,424 recoveries were reported in the last 24 hours.The state saw 116 casualties. Sangli reported the highest toll with 36 deaths. Of them, 29 were found in the district and the rest in the city. It was followed by Satara with 30 fatalities.Even as the decline in daily cases is slow, the Maharashtra government has granted relaxations in restrictions across the state from August 15. Officials said the impact of relaxations will be known in the next 15 days and further decisions will be taken after assessing the situation.On the other hand, Delta plus variant cases are rising in the state. Till Monday, the state had 76 Delta plus cases, a concern for the state administration.Maharashtra is the state with highest number of Covid-19 cases. Now, it also has maximum Delta plus variant cases.Significantly, it has also achieved a milestone of administering 50 million doses on Monday. It vaccinated 677,974 doses on Tuesday and has administered a total 50,710,698 doses till date, according to the data available on Co-Win portal.Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state task force for Covid-19, said, “Delta plus is an offshoot from AY.1. It’s a myth that Delta plus cases are rising in a significant number. There is a small number of Delta plus cases, but they have not reached any critical threshold. It is only 1% of the total number of positive samples collected for genomic sequencing. In terms of population it is only 0.0001%.”According to the health officials, most of the cases being reported in the state are from Delta variants in the last few months.Dr Joshi said that Delta variants were responsible for the second wave and continued to be the dominant strain even today. “A large part of the second wave was driven by the Delta variant. We still have the Delta strain very much prevalent in the population. For example, in a city like Mumbai, till January 2021 it was predominant by B.1617.1, which is being named as ‘Kappa’ and from March, it was gradually replaced by Delta (B.1.617.2). Kappa is almost virtually extinct. But the problem is Delta is more contagious. It is as contagious as chickenpox and a faster spreading virus than its previous variants,” he said.On August 15, the state government allowed reopening of shopping malls and allowed other establishments including malls to operate till 10pm. It also allowed gyms, parlours and salons to open with 50 per cent capacity. It has further opened local train services in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) for fully vaccinated people. “Maharashtra is also looking at fewer cases; compared to last month, daily cases have come to half. The districts of concern are also shrinking. We are reaching some degree of herd immunity to the Delta variant and thus we are gradually removing curbs. Every fortnight, we will see more and more relaxations and will assess if there is any negative impact of relaxations or not.”Dr Joshi said that the current data shows even if the state is relaxing the curbs, the daily cases are still on decline. On Sunday, Mumbai clocked 196 cases and reported a total 739,722 cases till date. It also recorded two fatalities taking the toll to 15,925. In the past 24 hours, the state tested 179,488 samples and had a positivity rate of 2.45%. However, the overall positivity rate of the state stood at 12.48%, according to the data issued by the state health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-breaches-6-4-million-mark-of-covid-19-cases-rise-in-delta-plus-cases-a-cause-of-worry-101629229000162.html

18-08-2021||Mumbai||Staff not fully jabbed yet, most malls in Mumbai remain shut||Two days after reopening, at least 12 malls in the city were shut on Tuesday, owing to the state’s condition that the staff should be fully vaccinated. Mall owners said a majority of their staff is partially vaccinated, considering they are below the age of 45. The state last week allowed malls to open from August 15, after asking them to stay shut all throughout the second wave of Covid-19. On Tuesday, Inorbit Mall, Growel’s 101 Mall and several other malls in the city remained shut on Tuesday, even as many are still to start operations. According to mall owners, last week they had sought clarity on citizens below 18 years of age, considering there is no vaccine for kids, and had also requested the state and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to relax the condition of two doses to a single dose. However, the state on Monday clarified that all staff members of malls and even customers will have to be fully vaccinated and two weeks should have passed after that to enter the mall and work. Regarding citizens below the age of 18, the state said they should be allowed, considering there is no vaccine available for children. Sachin Dhanawade, chief operating officer (COO), retail & real estate, Grauer & Weil (India) Limited, which operates Growel’s 1O1 Mall in Kandivli, said, “The condition is difficult to meet as a large majority of employees and staff are aged below 45. The vaccination for this age group started in May, which was soon suspended due to shortage. The supply was later resumed around June 21. Furthermore, the Central Government also extended the gap between two doses for Covishield. With most having taken the first dose only, malls will not be able to operate before September-end.” In a tweet, Inorbit Mall said, “Please note that Inorbit Mall Malad and Vashi will not be operational until further instructions from government authorities. We regret the inconvenience. Hope to see you soon.” Mukesh Kumar, chairman, Shopping Centres Association of India (SCAI), said it was impossible to run the malls in this scenario.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/staff-not-fully-jabbed-yet-most-malls-in-mumbai-remain-shut-101629228639715.html

After braving a crippling goods train stoppage just a few months ago, transporting shipments over water has emerged as a major worry for exporters. Ocean freight rates have risen at least 3.5-fold (250%) over the past six months and the local industry, which accounts for a major chunk of the country’s exports, says shipments are either being delayed or held back. The industry has also written to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) to address the crisis. A combination of factors has led to the higher shipping costs, with soaring demand amid stimulus packages the key. Saturated ports and not enough ships, dockworkers and truckers has aggravated the situation. Easing of restrictions after the second Covid wave is another contributing factor. From Ludhiana, yarn forms the major chunk of exports at about 25,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent unit) a year. Of this, hosiery accounts for 4,500 TEUs; export of rice follows at 2,000 TEUs. Export of bicycles, spare parts, auto-part components and engineering goods add another 1,700 TEUs. “For some destinations, the freight has increased between 500% and 600% (six-seven times); this increase is for the west coast of the US and Latin America. Cities like Los Angeles and Seattle are majorly affected. Even as we are ready to pay the higher rate, vessels are not available as ports are congested. There is a waiting time of two-three weeks in countries along the west coast. Shipping lines are minting profits, with the only silver lining being that our main competitor, China, is also in the same boat,” said Amit Thapar, vice-chairman, Confederation of Commerce and Industry (CII), Punjab. Upkar Singh Ahuja, president, Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertaking (CICU), said, “Our Export Promotion Committee is working to resolve issues of members with the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), under the Union ministry of commerce.” Sarvjit Singh, co-convener, export committee, CICU, said a consignment to East Africa which used to cost $1,400 (just over ₹1 crore) is now costing $4,800 (around ₹3.5 crore). He added, “Shipping companies are charging huge amounts and exporters have to pay up for the fear of losing customers. The nexus between top officials of shipping lines and some freight forwarders is behind the steep increase in ocean freight rates. If the practice continues, exporters might have to shut shop. Rates gone up to 250% (3.5 times), which is forcing exporters to delay or hold the shipment.”An export committee member, chartered accountant Abhilesh Aneja, said the average container price (40 feet) from India to the US has risen 3-5 times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/threefold-hike-in-ocean-freight-rates-in-six-months-hits-exporters-hard-101629228459778.html

The directions were passed after Breach Candy Hospital where Babu had been undergoing treatment for an eye infection for almost three months submitted a report stating that his health condition had improved. Babu will be discharged from the hospital on Wednesday. On May 19, the division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, was hearing the petition filed by Babu’s wife Jenny Roweena – seeking bail for her husband on medical grounds or transfer to a private hospital for treatment. The bench had directed the professor’s transfer to the private hospital for treatment, provided he bore the cost of same. On July 29, Babu’s counsel had informed HC that his client had largely recovered from the eye ailment, and as the slight swelling in the corner of the eye could be treated with antibiotics, his wife was not seeking any further reliefs. The bench then asked the hospital to submit Babu’s latest health report. On Tuesday, advocates Yug Mohit Chaudhry and Payoshi Roy, representing Roweena, submitted that though the hospital report stated that Babu was fit to be discharged, he should be taken to the private hospital for regular follow-ups as the swelling in his eye had not subsided entirely. Chief public prosecutor Aruna Pai for the prison authority submitted that Sir JJ Hospital was well-equipped for the check-ups and hence, there was no need to take Babu to the private hospital. However, the bench said that in the event that the state-run hospital did not have the facilities for the check-up, Babu should be taken to the private hospital. Pai said that Babu would have to bear the cost every time he is taken to the private hospital. The bench then observed that getting admitted was a different issue but in light of various judgments, consultation was the responsibility of the state. “We don’t know if you have visited these [government] hospitals; they are good. Only thing is he should get timely treatment. If the systems can be improved more and infrastructure can be given. We can only suggest, ultimately it is up to the state (sic),” remarked the bench. The bench, while directing that Babu be transferred to Taloja jail after he is discharged from hospital, asked the superintendent of the prison to take the professor to Sir JJ Hospital when the need arose and also directed that he be referred to the private hospital if required, and disposed of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-hany-babu-to-be-shifted-back-to-navi-mumbai-jail-says-hc-101629228339713.html
18-08-2021||Bangalore||Fearing complications, Covid infected couple dies by suicide in Karnataka||Fearing complications after showing symptoms of Covid-19, a couple died by suicide at Baikampady in Mangaluru on Tuesday, city police commissioner N Shashi Kumar said. Before ending their lives, the 40-year-old man had sent an audio message to the top cop and a few of his friends, Kumar added. In the audio clip, the couple purportedly said that they were showing symptoms of Covid-19 for the last seven days, and fearing complications, had decided not to seek treatment. According to the police, since the 35-year-old woman’s eyesight was deteriorating, and both were facing difficulty in breathing, the couple decided to die by suicide. The commissioner said he tried to trace the couple and even sent a team to their apartment but the duo were found dead by then. Police also recovered a suicide note, purportedly written by the wife, from the apartment. “As we see people losing eyesight and other organs because of Black Fungus infection followed by Covid-19, I fear that the same thing might happen to me, as I am getting symptoms and could sense changes in my body,” the woman wrote in her suicide note. “My husband is also showing symptoms of Covid-19 from the last three days, and in this situation, we have come to a decision that we don’t want to live any further. My father, mother and brother have got infected with Covid and they recovered. My mother suffered a lot and I don’t want to give them any difficulty in carrying out our funeral,” the suicide note added.The couple in their note also requested that their belongings be distributed to the poor, people aware of the developments said. Reacting to the incident, Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar said: “More than 2.8 million people have recovered from the disease. The couple had lack of information. I urge people to get tested if they are detected with Covid symptoms. No one should panic and until the vaccination drive is completed, Covid guidelines must be followed.” (With inputs from agencies) (Those under stress and experiencing suicidal tendency can contact Arogya Sahayavani on 104, or the mental health helpline 080-46110007)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/fearing-complications-covid-infected-couple-dies-by-suicide-in-karnataka-101629228279017.html
18-08-2021||Bangalore||Dakshina Kannada logs surge in cases, reports more cases than Bengaluru||Since August 10, except for the two days (i.e August 13 and 17), Dakshina Kannada district has reported more Covid-19 cases than Bengaluru, shows data from state health department. Since the outbreak of the virus on March 8, 2020, Bengaluru has been reporting the highest number of Covid-19 cases in the state, until now. The administration of the Dakshina Kannada district, which shares its border with Kerala, has blamed visitors from across the border for the surge in Covid-19 cases. With districts, especially Mangaluru city, emerging as a hotspot, the district administration is even considering stricter measures including a lockdown if the pandemic crosses a certain threshold. “I want to make it very clear that I’m not saying that a lockdown will be imposed, but we are prepared for the eventuality if the numbers crossed 1,000 or more cases per day. The biggest problem has been the interstate commute to Mangaluru. We understand that many are coming here for work, but we have witnessed a lot of non-essential travel as well. If the current measures can’t control the situation, we will have to look at the stricter measures,” said the senior official of the Mangaluru district administration, who didn’t want to be named. For the residents of Kasaragod in Kerala, Mangaluru city in Dakshina Kannada is a lifeline. Even though Mangaluru and Kasaragod are on either side of a map, they are closely knit, say residents. Mangaluru is the closest city to Kasaragod. From anywhere in Kasaragod, Mangaluru is just 10-50 km away and the closest city in Kerala, Kannur, is more than 100 km away. The test positivity rate in Dakshina Kannada is above 3%, much higher than the state average of 1%. According to the district administration, between August 1 to August 15, 103,000 RT-PCR tests have been conducted at an average of 9,000 tests a day. “There have been protests at the border because people are not happy with the rule mandating RT-PCR tests for those entering the city. We are left with no option because we are the only state with positivity higher than 3%,” the district administration official added. The state reported 1,298 new cases on Tuesday taking the active caseload to 21,481. Bengaluru accounted for 340 new infections, taking its active cases to 7,913. As many as 32 fatalities were reported across the state on Tuesday, which took the state’s toll to 37,039. Bengaluru’s toll due to Covid-19 jumped to 15,915, with 10 deaths being reported Tuesday, according to the state health department. Among the new cases reported in Karnataka, on Tuesday Dakshina Kawanda accounted for 288 cases and 5 deaths. According to officials, apart from the increased testing, the district is preparing ramping up medical facilities as the district has high chances witnessing a third Covid wave. The district administration has reserved 50 beds in four of the district’s taluk hospitals, this is in addition to the facilities at Wenlock District Hospital and eight medical colleges. “36 Covid Care Centres with nearly 2,700 beds have also been readied. The administration has directed 118 hospitals and clinics registered under the KPME Act to be prepared to manage cases. We are also setting a 13,000-litre medical oxygen plant at Wenlock Hospital. The hospital already has a 12,000-litre oxygen plant,” said deputy commissioner K Rajendra. He added that the district administration will set up 16 oxygen plants for supply in rural areas by end of the month. Experts believe that the younger population might be one of the vulnerable groups in the third wave. Addressing this concern, Rajendra said that each taluk hospital has been equipped with pediatric primary care units. “We have hired enough doctors and other medical staff as per the requirement. More will be hired as and when required,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/dakshina-kannada-logs-surge-in-cases-reports-more-cases-than-bengaluru-101629227919600.html
18-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Covid vax trial participants, those who got jabs abroad, struggle for train passes||In October 2020, Mankhurd resident Shakeel Shaikh had enthusiastically participated in the Covid-19 vaccine clinical trial at Parel’s KEM hospital. In April 2021, when the hospital unblinded the trial, Shaikh, 40, was told that he had received two shots of the real Covishield vaccine and not the placebo. He also received a certificate from the hospital to verify that he was fully vaccinated. But since last week, Shaikh has failed to convince civic and railway officials to consider this certificate so that he can get a railway pass. Like Shaikh, hundreds of clinical-trial participants are struggling to get a train travel pass as their data is yet to be uploaded on the CoWin software. “I have tried to convince officials sitting at the helpdesk at Mankhurd and Kurla railway stations, but they refused to consider my certificate,” said Shaikh. “I also tried to generate an e-pass, but that’s also linked to CoWin,” he said. According to Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM Hospital, they had unblinded the trial with permission from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which was a co-investigator in the trial and its ethics committee. “We have already requested the ICMR to update the data of trial participants. It is likely to be done by month-end,” said Deshmukh, adding that there would be nearly 200 such trial participants whose records have to be updated on CoWin. “All trial sites will have such participants,” he said. In another case, 30-year-old Wadala resident Naved Kazi, who got two doses of the Moderna vaccine in Qatar, has been struggling to get a pass. The civic and railway officials at the helpdesk at Wadala railway station refused to consider his vaccine certificate issued by Doha’s Hamad Medical Corporation. “I could not even generate an e-pass with my certificate,” said Kazi, who worked in the hospitality sector in Doha for three years and is now looking for a job in Mumbai. “I have interviews lined up. I need to take the train,” he said. Central and Western Railway officials HT spoke to said that they were not involved in the verification process. “The civic officials are at the helpdesks to verify the vaccination status. Our staff is only assisting them,” said Sumit Thakur, chief public relations officer, Western Railway. An official from Central Railway echoed the same. A senior civic official said the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has already written to the Maharashtra government to upgrade the e-pass website for those vaccinated abroad. It is likely to be done soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaicovid-vax-trial-participants-those-who-got-jabs-abroad-struggle-for-train-passes-101629227859917.html
18-08-2021||Mumbai||CBI not entitled to documents till they show relevance to probe: Maharashtra govt||The Maharashtra government in an affidavit filed before the Bombay high court (HC) has stated that the application filed by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), seeking documents in the probe related to allegations of corruption and political influence in police transfers, is vague. The state, in response to CBI’s interim application – filed against the refusal of the government to hand over documents sought by them pertaining to the corruption case – also said that the central agency is silent on how the documents are relevant and needed in the probe. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, after hearing the state government’s petition challenging and seeking the removal of two unnumbered paragraphs in the CBI’s first information report (FIR) on July 22 had directed the central agency to continue the investigation on corruption charges against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh and others as directed by HC’s April 5 order. The July 22 order had stipulated that the investigation should be in accordance with law. However, after additional solicitor general Anil Singh had informed the bench that the state police officers were refusing to part with the documents sought by the agency as per the July 22 order, the bench had directed CBI to file a separate application. The application stated that the officers were not only refusing to part with the documents but also resorted to threats. The state has responded to the allegations made in the application through an affidavit that stated that CBI was seeking documents of investigations that had been undertaken by the cyber police with an intent to jeopardise and interfere in the investigations. The affidavit filed by Kailas Arjun Gaikwad, joint secretary, home department, has further stated that CBI was going beyond the directions of the July 22 order by stating that the documents are relevant and needed without actually mentioning how so. The affidavit stated that if CBI’s application is accepted, it would give “uncontrolled, unrestricted and unimaginable authority” to the applicant to seek any and every document and/or information from the state for investigation. “The entire present application is blissfully vague and eloquently silent as to how the documents and/or material sought by the present applicant, which the respondent is not inclined to share with the applicant are “relevant”, “material” and “needed” for the purpose of investigation undertaken by the applicant (sic),” stated the affidavit. It added that till CBI does not demonstrate the relevance of the documents sought to HC, it was not entitled to get them. The affidavit also points to the fact that all orders and judgments delivered by HC in the matter give a very restricted and circumscribed authority, power and jurisdiction to CBI to investigate in Maharashtra. This is in light of the withdrawal of consent by the state government to conduct investigation by CBI, in the light of section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act. The affidavit has also alleged that CBI is relying upon replies issued and/or responses given by the state prior to the July 22 order of HC and trying to mislead the court. In light of these submissions, the affidavit has sought dismissal of CBI’s application.HC has posted the hearing to Friday when it will consider the application by CBI and the state’s response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cbi-not-entitled-to-documents-till-they-show-relevance-to-probe-maharashtra-govt-101629227807202.html
18-08-2021||Mumbai||Cut-offs for popular Mumbai University degree courses jump by 10-13 percentage points||The first general merit list for first-year (FY) undergraduate courses announced on Tuesday saw cut-offs increase by 10 to 13 percentage points on an average compared to last year, according to data shared by city colleges.Increasing Covid-19 cases forced most school education boards to scrap their class 12 exams this year and instead assessed students based on their performance across Classes 10, 11 and 12. The final results saw a massive increase of students in the 90% club. While ICSE and CBSE schools boasted of nearly 50% or more of their Class 12 students scoring above 90-95% this year, the number of 90% scorers across the state jumped by 12-fold, compared to last year. For the first time ever, 46 HSC students managed to score a perfect 100% this year.While some colleges reported an increase of six-eight percentage points across courses, the cut-off for BSc course at Vile Parle’s Mithibai College witnessed a hike of 29 percentage points - from 55.1% last year to 84.1% this year.At St Xavier’s College, one of the most popular choices for Bachelor of Arts (BA) aspirants, the first merit list for FYBA course ended at 98% for state board students and 99.17% for non-state board students—the state board list witnessing a jump of six percentage points. The biggest jump, however, was seen in BSc Biological courses at Dhobi Talao college where the list ended at 92% for state board students, up 13 percentage points from 79% last year. Even the minority quota merit list for FYBA ended at 91% for HSC students and 95.8% for non-state board students at the institute this year.“All seats in the FYBA course have been allotted in the first merit list itself. Vacant seats, if any, will only be revealed once the round ends when we will find out how many students don’t confirm their admissions,” said Rajendra Shinde, principal, St Xavier’s College.Once again, self-financed courses including Bachelor in Management Studies (BMS), BA in Mass Media and Communication (BAMMC, formerly BMM), BCom in Accounting & Finance (BAF), BCom in Banking Insurance attracted top scorers across different streams and colleges. At Narsee Monjee College, Vile Parle, the first merit list for BMS ended at 95.8% (for Arts), 95.2% (for Science) and 97% (for Commerce), nearly two-three percentage points higher compared to last year. At RA Podar College, Matunga, another popular choice for commerce and BMS aspirants, the BMS merit list ended at 94.6% (for Arts) 94.7% (for Science) and 96.8% (for Commerce), nearly three to ten percentage points higher compared to last year.“We knew admission to top colleges would be a challenge this year, but the first merit list has shocked us all. In many cases, the first merit list has ended at 95-98%, which means this year, even a 90% won’t assure anyone a seat in a college and/or course of one’s choice,” said Riddhi Parikh, an ICSE student who scored 93% in her boards and missed a chance to be allotted in a college of her choice. “I have been allotted a seat in another college, which was not high on my priority list. Any other year I would have cancelled this admission and waited for the next merit list, but this year I’m not sure anyone can take such a risk,” she added.At Jai Hind College, Churchgate, cut-offs across streams also witnessed an increase and the hope for students in the next two lists remain low. “We are a minority college so we have already completed the in-house, minority quota admissions and the remaining seats have been allotted to the open category in the first round itself. I’m sure we will have to announce a second merit list in order to fill up all seats but I highly doubt there will be a third merit list for popular courses,” said Ashok Wadia, principal of Jai Hind College.Additional division for colleges Earlier this month, the state government released a circular, allowing colleges to add an extra division to certain popular courses to accommodate all students owing to a higher number of class 12 students clearing their exams this year.“This option will be available to colleges only for the 2021-22 academic year and can continue for the current batch until the completion of their graduation,” said the circular. College principals, however, have not shown interest in this move, with many saying it will be impossible to add divisions in terms of infrastructure in space-starved institutes, once colleges reopen for physical classes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cutoffs-for-popular-mumbai-university-degree-courses-jump-by-10-13-percentage-points-101629227806071.html

I will soon visit Delhi to seek an additional supply of vaccines to our state. The private sector can procure 25% of the vaccine production. We are having discussions with corporate companies to explore the possibilities of procuring vaccines under CSR and providing it to the state government. This will significantly accelerate the vaccination drive,” Sudhakar said in a statement.Sudhakar said that he will accompany chief minister Basavaraj Bommai to Delhi next week and hope to secure a larger order of vaccines for the state. He said that the centre has assured to give the state around 7.5 million doses in August, of which around 3.5 million have already been administered.Sudhakar added that even chief minister Bommai will meet with leading captains of all industries including information technology, biotechnology and other large corporations for support on its vaccination drive.The CSR funds can be used to buy a higher share of vaccines allotted for the private sector, which is around 25%, he added.Karnataka has so far inoculated 35,430,742 people, according to the data on the Cowin dashboard. This includes 27,321,422 of the first dose and 8,109,320 of the second dose, the data shows. Karnataka administered 320,908 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine on Tuesday until 7 pm.While regions like Bengaluru are seeing a large vaccination coverage, rural areas of the southern state have suffered on account of lower availability of the vaccine, as boards of “no vaccine stock” dons the walls and gates of primary health care centres in various districts.Bengaluru, the biggest city of Karnataka, which houses over a quarter of the state’s 70 million population, has seen a higher coverage since a large portion of the vaccination is paid for by the people.With a possible third wave of Covid-19 infections looming large over the state, the government has a few options but to increase its vaccination drive to ensure it has enough space in its already inadequate healthcare infrastructure to cope with any sudden spike or risk a collapse like it did in the second wave.In the last eight days, Karnataka has recorded 12,116 new infections, according to the state health department.There were 1,298 new cases of Covid-19 infections in 24 hours and 1,833 recoveries, according to data released by the state health department on Tuesday. The total number of active cases stood at 21,481. The death toll rose to 37,039 as 32 more succumbed to the virus across the state, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department.The positivity rate stood at 1.01% and the case fatality rate rose to 2.46%, according to government data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/karnataka-taps-on-doors-of-hni-large-corps-to-increase-vaccination-drive-101629227559385.html
18-08-2021||Other||900 illegal water connections regularised in Moga without requisite charges, penalty||Moga In a serious act of omission that points to widespread corruption, the Moga municipal corporation (MC) has regularised over 900 illegal water and sewerage connections over the past two months, by just charging a government fee between ₹200 and ₹500 per connection. Officials did not collect road cutting charges, connection fee, security fee, arrears and penalty, resulting in loss of revenue to the state exchequer, the MC record shows. What raises eyebrows even more is the fact that MC has regularised these connections when the policy for regularisation of unauthorised connections was in the pipeline. On Monday itself, the state government has announced that it will implement ‘One Time Settlement Policy’ for unauthorised water and sewerage connections; there is, however, no notification as yet. “The regularisation of illegal connections has been done at very low fee, when even as for a new connection, residents have to pay over ₹5,000 under various heads,” said an MC official, on the condition of anonymity. The matter came to light when Davinder Singh, a superintendent of water and sewerage branch of MC, filed a reply over allegations of corruption in regularisation of illegal connections. On May 18, the MC had issued a circular seeking applications for regularisation of illegal water and sewerage connections. The circular asked offenders to deposit between ₹100 and ₹500 for regularisation of connection. HT has a copy of this circular and the superintendent’s reply. The Moga MC has fixed road cutting charges as ₹13 per square ft for katcha road; ₹351 per square ft for BM and premix road; ₹66 per square ft for brick paving block; ₹264 for CC road and ₹264 per square ft for premix carpet road. It also charges ₹200 as security and another ₹200 for water and sewerage connection. Suresh Sood, a local activist, said, “The corporation has legalised these illegal connections under the garb of the ‘One Time Settlement Policy’, while the state government is yet to implement it. The real motive is corruption.”Davinder Singh, superintendent of water and sewerage branch, said, “There are over 3,000 illegal connections in the city and we have regularised 938 of these. The corporation had issued a circular for regularisation of these connections, and I performed my duty as directed.” Moga MC commissioner Surinder Singh, said, “I will look into the matter immediately. I have joined only recently.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/900-illegal-water-connections-regularised-in-moga-without-requisite-charges-penalty-101629227439519.html

In the call that lasted less than five minutes, apart from checking on her parents and siblings, she asked whether the Taliban are allowing women to work. Farzan is among hundreds of Afghan students pursuing their higher education in Bengaluru. Anxious and anguished, the students are finding solace in the close-knit Afghan community in the city. For women like Farzan, their concerns are layered. Apart from concerns about the safety of their families, they are worried that the Taliban regime might undermine their hard work and academic achievements. Before coming to India for higher studies, Farzan was teaching at Herat University; she is not now sure whether her job will remain when she returns to Afghanistan. “I’m doing my masters in journalism because I want to pursue a career as a journalist or get back to teaching journalism. I don’t know what will happen now and what I will I do when I got back home. Sit at home as they (Taliban) want in a country where I don’t have the right to vote? I don’t want to do that,” said Farzan. Talking about her immediate plans, she said that though she is concerned about her family, she won’t be returning to Afghanistan. “My sister is also a graduate from the (Herat) university. She told me that as of now, all have been asked to stay home and they will allow women to work in the coming days. We will wait and see,” said Farzan. Another student says knowing the Taliban’s history, the new regime or its promises can’t be trusted. “The government has handed over power to the Taliban without a fight. The Taliban have made promises that they will allow women to study and work, but we can’t trust them because of their history of violence,” said Palwasha, who is pursuing her Master of Business Administration in Bengaluru. “Women in our country have suffered to get education and for the right to work. I can’t accept if someone says I have to sit at home and I don’t have the right to work,” said Palwasha. Asked whether she will be returning to Afghanistan, she said she will return if she is allowed to work. “If I’m not allowed the basic human right to work, I would want to live in India or any other country, where I can work.” While Farzan and Palwasha have two more semesters in the university, her seniors might have to return at the end of the academic year. “I don’t know what I should do. The family is in Afghanistan, but under the Taliban, we would be 20 years behind in history. From what we have heard, it was a time when a woman didn’t matter. I don’t want that. I will see how things are by the time my course is over,” said a Bangalore University student, who didn’t want to be named. Marwa, another MBA student, said the information they are getting from home is not clear. Some people back home have told them that the Taliban would allow women to work and the regime will not be regressive, while others claim that initial optics are mere eyewash. “I hope that our generation doesn’t have to face that bad phase (the regressive Taliban rule) again. My only prayer to Allah is that we don’t see that phase again,” she said. Former classmates of Afghan students are also concerned about their safety back home. “Our friend Hamid, who studied with us in St Joseph’s College between 2006 and 2009, is a government official in Afghanistan. We have not heard from him since the war has begun. We are concerned,” said Masood Faraz, a former student of St Joseph’s College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/we-can-t-trust-taliban-s-claims-afghan-women-studying-in-bengaluru-101629227379554.html
18-08-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka to track health of 15 mn children to minimise impact of third wave||The Karnataka government will initiate a programme to test 15 million children to identify vulnerable groups and monitor them closely to mitigate the impact of a possible Covid-19 third wave, the state health minister said on Tuesday.The programme, ‘Arogya Nandana’, will be launched by chief minister Basavaraj Bommai soon, said K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education.“There are about 1.5 crore children in the state and all of them will be subjected to tests under this initiative,” he said. “Children with less immunity power and other comorbidities will be identified and they will be provided with nutritious food and supplements to boost immunity. All precautionary measures will be taken to monitor their health.” The initiative comes even as the state is reporting nearly 1,000 daily Covid cases. Karnataka reported 1,065 new Covid-19 cases, including 270 in Bengaluru Urban, on Monday, according to health department data.As of now, children below 18 years are not eligible for vaccination, which leaves them as the most vulnerable to the coronavirus.The state government has also decided to reopen schools from August 23 for classes 9 to 12 in districts where the Covid test positivity rate is less than 2%, which adds to the risk of them contracting the virus while out of the safety of their homes.An expert committee, led by cardiologist Dr Devi Prasad Shetty, submitted an interim report to the state government on June 22, recommending the reopening of schools and colleges despite the looming threat of a third wave.Emphasising that education is a fundamental right of the child, the government-appointed technical advisory committee (TAC), in its recommendations, said reopening schools would optimise learning, physical and mental health, and cater to nutritional aspects of children.According to the TAC, there are 23,838,995 people below the age of 18 in the state, accounting for 34% of Karnataka population.The state government has decided to resume physical classes for students in graduate courses and started to increase the vaccination coverage. However, experts doubt if the Bommai-led government will be able to achieve such a feat with the previous Yediyurappa government unable to minimise the impact of the second wave as it neglected warnings by the TAC in November last year.“Among the total Covid-19 infections, children aged between 0-18 years constituted around 8to 10% during (the) 1st and 2nd wave. Most national and international data indicated that a maximum of 5-7% of such children require hospitalisation. However, a recent data from the USA suggests that children in the age group of 12-17 years requires almost around 31% ICUadmission and among them 5% needed invasive ventilation, but no deaths reported. To meetthe surge in India, specially in Karnataka, we need to be ready for a little higher number to berequiring hospitalisation,” the TAC report said.The TAC has estimated the bed requirement according to categories of moderate, best and worst case scenarios.According to its estimates, the state government would require around 51,008 beds, including 6,801 ICU/HDU beds, in the best case scenario. In the moderate case scenario, 73,963 beds are required. In the worst case scenario, the TAC has estimated the bed requirement of 95,216, including 13602 ICU/HDU beds.For testing, the TAC has said children are comfortable with non-conventional methods, such as nasal and oropharyngeal swabs, gargle and salivary RT-PCR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-to-track-health-of-15-mn-children-to-minimise-impact-of-third-wave-101629227260784.html

The meeting was held at Chatly’s house on Hambran road.As per information, Sharma asked the leaders not to leave the party, but no consensus could not be reached. The leaders stated that they stand united with Anil Joshi and few others from the BJP will also join SAD along with them. The BJP leaders from the city are also expected to conduct a meeting with Joshi in this regard on Wednesday. The BJP in July had expelled Joshi for six years after he criticised the state and the central leadership for mishandling the farm agitation. A show-cause notice was also served to RD Sharma who supported Joshi during a meeting held in the city in the recent past. One of the leaders, requesting anonymity, said that during the meeting with Ashwani Sharma, they asked the state leadership to work things out with Joshi as only then the issue can be resolved.Mintu Sharma said,”We will be moving ahead with the decision taken by Joshi to join SAD.” Meanwhile, district BJP president Pushpinder Singal said, “The leaders have been asked to take up the issues concerning them at party level and those will be resolved. It is an internal matter of the party and it should be resolved in house only,” he said.Meanwhile, former BJP district president Rajiv Katna joined back the party fold in presence of Ashwani Sharma on Tuesday.

Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the lining of the intestines caused by a virus, bacteria, or parasites. It spreads through contaminated food or water or by contact with an infected person. Senior medical officer from Bhawanigarh government hospital Dr Mahesh Ahuja said, “We admitted 35 patients since August 13, but now only five are still in hospital. The rest have recovered.” Bhawanigarh Nagar council officials also claimed that leakage in water pipelines had been traced. For now, tankers have been deployed to provide drinking water in the town. “Over 30 patients have recovered. The health department teams are also visiting affected areas of the town where people are complaining of vomiting and diarrhoea. The situation is under control,” Ahuja added. Sukhdeep Kaur, a patient, said that she had been suffering from diarrhoea for a couple of days and got admitted Monday evening. “Locals are forced to drink contaminated water, and people still fear Covid-19. They are, thus, avoiding hospitals. The administration is not serious about resolving the problem.”Bhawanigarh Nagar Council executive officer Parvinder Singh said, “We have found a leak in the pipeline and repaired it. Still, tankers are being called in to supply drinking water. Tap water should be avoided. The cases are decreasing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gastroenteritis-outbreak-in-sangrur-s-bhawanigarh-35-report-sick-in-5-days-101629227020404.html
18-08-2021||Mumbai||Vidhie Mukerjea: Mother said she’ll prove her innocence to me||Months after former media baron Peter Mukerjea’s memoir Star Struck: Confessions of a TV Executive came out in February, 23-year-old step daughter Vidhie Mukerjea’s book, Devil’s Daughter is set to hit the shelf. Published by Westland, the book offers new perspective on the Sheena Bora murder case, which came to light in 2015. Mukerjea, then 17, was living in Mumbai with her parents Indrani and Peter, co-founders of INX Media, who were arrested for allegedly conspiring to kill Bora, Indrani’s daughter from a previous marriage. Bora’s partially burnt body was recovered from a forest in Raigad district three years after the murder took place.On August 25, 2015 Indrani was arrested for allegedly murdering 24-year-old Bora in 2012. Indrani was charged with murder, criminal conspiracy, kidnapping and destruction of evidence. Her driver Shyamvar Rai and her former husband and Mukerjea’s biological father Sanjeev Khanna were also arrested. Three months later, Peter was arrested as well. In March this year, the Bombay high court found that Peter (66) was not directly involved on the day of the crime and granted bail to him. In July, the special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court rejected Indrani and Khanna’s bail applications and Indrani (49) remains lodged at the Byculla Women’s Prison. The case is before the Civil and Sessions court and over 60 witnesses have been examined so far. While Indrani has claimed that the witness statements are riddled with discrepancies, Peter has claimed that the charges against him are defective as he was in London at the time of the alleged murder.“At some point, around 2007, Mum introduced me to this beautiful girl. She said it was her sister, Sheena. She was tall and slender, with jet-black hair and fair skin. She had these gorgeous brown eyes, and her striking features all coexisted beautifully on her face. Sheena looked incredibly similar to Mum. Within the first few times of meeting, we grew fond of each other,” Mukerjea wrote in the book.Indrani, who married Peter in 2002, when Mukerjea was three years old, had told her family that Bora was her sister. According to the Mumbai police and later the CBI, who investigated the case, Indrani allegedly strangled Bora to death in a car after Bora refused to break off her relationship with Rahul, Peter’s son from a previous marriage. The investigators said that Bora had blackmailed Indrani, threatening to expose the fact that she was actually her daughter. Indrani reportedly used Bora’s phone to send text messages leading family members to believe that Bora had moved to the United States, the Mumbai police investigation stated. The CBI maintained that while Indrani is the prime accused, Peter did not make any effort to find Bora between 2012 and 2015.“I always knew that I ought to record my experience. I tried once or twice but soon realised it wasn’t the right time. During the pandemic due to psychotherapy called shadow work, I managed to open up,” Mukerjea said over an email interview. At time of her parents going to jail, Mukerjea who was to turn 18 was set to leave for London to study at Regent University. Vidhie, who had completed most of her schooling in England, graduated in International Business from Barcelona. Bora stayed with the Mukerjeas in 2007 in their apartment in Central Mumbai. She later shifted to South Mumbai as she was studying in St Xavier’s College.Vidhie said she enjoyed Bora’s company and they often watched movies together, and went out for ice cream. “I felt we had a sisterly connection. She loved me so much and I did her,” she wrote.According to the book, in 2010, Bora told Peter, Rahul and Mukerjea that she was not Indrani’s sister, but was in fact, her daughter. At the time, Indrani was in Goa attending a relative’s wedding – Mukerjea and Peter were to join her there shortly.“Whilst we were outside on terrace of our apartment, Sheena told [me] she’d recently met her real dad. She repeated the story of how Indrani was actually her mother, looked at me, held my hand, and affirmed, ‘We are sisters, Vids’. This was actually the first that I had heard this story — no one had told me what had happened earlier. I remember this moment so clearly, the sense of betrayal and confusion as to why Mum would lie about this, but that was trumped by the feeling that I had a sister! We’d had this unspoken sisterly connection right from the beginning, and we loved each other so much that I couldn’t have been happier to find out that she really was my big sister.”Her mother countered this, Mukerjea wrote.“Indrani: she is one of the smartest women I know, and anyone who knows her will not disagree with this. She has the power to talk her way into and out of any situation. She had one of the toughest childhoods possible, and it honed her skill for self-preservation. She told us that she would take a DNA test, and also gave us ‘proof’ that Rahul and Sheena were doing drugs together. The whole narrative was turned around so it seemed like they were plotting against her to make her look bad. She even threatened to divorce Papa and leave. What does one think and do in this situation? We started to doubt ourselves. Mum got into both of our heads, and at the end of it, we felt Sheena and Rahul had made up this massive hoax.” Barring a few press interviews, Mukerjea has been so far silent about the case and her family. She writes about her loneliness after the arrest of both her parents, and said that she underwent depression, and faced panic attacks. “I went through hell for five years. “ Peter suffered a heart attack in 2019 while he was in judicial custody. Mukerjea was in Barcelona at the time. “I was in a terrible headspace back then, and I treated everyone as though they were all against me. I kept telling myself, ‘If anything happens to Papa, I’m going to be the first one that’ll be kicked out. Everyone hates me.’ I knew that a few members in the family had warned the others, telling them I could screw my father over, just like my mum had. Like mother like daughter, they thought. But the truth is none of them knew me or my relationship with my father,” she wrote. Mukerjea wrote about the deep bond she shared with Peter. She also touched upon her relationship with Indrani.“They (Sanjeev and Indrani) met in Kolkata, fell in love, and got married, as one does. I was conceived during their marriage. A few years down the line, my mum and Sanjeev had a terrible falling out and decided to get a divorce. She told me she gave up everything she had, all the money and the property she owned, to get custody of me.” Mukerjea, currently in Mumbai, said that she speaks to Indrani over the phone once a week.“My mother and I are close in a different way. We have a complicated relationship that we are trying to work out. I am trying to understand her as she is trying to understand me. We are both trying to navigate our relationship,” Mukerjea over an email interview. “There are many things my mum has done, things I won’t be able to forgive her for, but I have taken a path where I will give her a chance. I believe every single person deserves it,” Mukerjea wrote in her book. “She told me how hurt and alone she’d felt: that for years she had absolutely no one, but when I reconnected with her she saw light and hope. She told me she had never given up, and would prove her innocence for me. I told her if we have to have a relationship there was a list of questions she needed to answer and she needed to be entirely truthful. I would know if she was lying to me, I told her, I have learnt a great deal in the past five years, and I believe one of the things I am better at is reading people. She promised me she would do whatever it took to mend things with me. I believe her.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vidhie-mukerjea-mother-said-she-ll-prove-her-innocence-to-me-101629227019300.html

The way the entire country was glued to the screens to watch the hockey teams’ matches, it is quite evident there is something more to hockey than just sports. In these crisis times, the teams have brought smiles to the faces of crores of Indians. We all should be thankful to our boys and girls,” he said. As a token of appreciation, each team gifted a framed Jersey autographed by the players to Patnaik.Patnaik also gave away the ‘player with the maximum number of goals scored’ award to Harmanpreet Singh while PR Sreejesh won the award for the player with the maximum number of goals saved.

18-08-2021||Mumbai||Despite travel curbs, no end to rash driving on highways connecting Mumbai||Travel restrictions owing to the Covid-19 pandemic have failed to contain the fatalities on national highways.According to statistics provided by the Maharashtra Highway Police, 2,754 fatal accidents were reported from 2019 to June 2021 on four national highways – Mumbai-Goa, Mumbai-Kolhapur, Mumbai-Surat and Mumbai-Agra – in which 3,012 people lost their lives.The data also revealed that from 2019 to June 30, 2021, a total of 12,850 accidents took place on the four major highways connecting Mumbai to other cities.Police officers said even though travel curbs were in place across the country, fatal accidents have not declined. In 2019, the four major highways reported 2,696 accidents, including 1,084 fatal ones in which 1,166 people lost their lives. In 2020, the figures did not show any vast decline despite the lockdown as 2,158 accidents took place, including 1,114 fatal accidents in which 1,215 people died.This year till June 30, the four national highways have witnessed 1,196 accidents, wherein 621 people have lost their lives.Highway police officers said that most of these accidents occurred due to human error on part of heavy vehicle drivers.The most number of accidents, however, were reported on Mumbai-Agra and Mumbai-Kolhapur highways, making them the most dangerous road stretches.To bring down accidents, BK Upadhyay, additional director general of police (highways), said that since March this year, they have begun an intensive drive to book violators through the e-challan system.Apart from non-governmental organisations (NGO) and local bodies, the police are also taking help of locals and employees of private establishments located on highways to provide first aid to accident victims and assistance in taking them to nearby trauma centres or hospitals.As a part of the project, the police have started capacity building at spots which have been identified as accident-prone areas so that the fatalities are brought down. The police have positioned cranes and emergency vehicles near identified hot spots so that the victims can get immediate medical assistance. Apart from this, the police have also blocked unauthorised median cuts across the highways, which were causing accidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/despite-travel-curbs-no-end-to-rash-driving-on-highways-connecting-mumbai-101629226661178.html

The members of this group are students of different colleges and universities from across the country but are residing in Prayagraj.In the past two months, the youths have donated over 1000 beneficial indoor plants to residents of their respective localities of Prayagraj and have spread awareness about environment protection.“Our enthusiastic team members have donated snake plant, money plant, aloe vera, heart plant, dragon plant, etc as all of these plants are one among the most oxygen producing indoor plants and can work as a natural air purifier too”, said founder of the society, Devesh Jaiswal, who is 20 years old and a resident of Kareli locality. We decided to undertake the drive after witnessing the wrath of Covid-19 pandemic resulting into loss of several lives for not having enough supply of oxygen, said Devesh, a BBA student. Another member of the society Shuti Srivastava, 20 and a resident of Preetam Nagar colony said, “Our young members are telling everyone as how even now, humans are constantly cutting trees to create urban jungles and as a part of Karma, everyone is suffering. This suffering will not stop until or unless we start taking a positive step towards the greener earth and start planting trees and plants”. But for that to happen, we will have to change ourselves and this modest step like keeping and nurturing indoor plants was a small step towards the needed change, added the undergrad. Euphorial Youth Society’s plant donation campaign was held in two phases. In phase 1, under the leadership of Jaiswal and Stuti, a team of 12 volunteers were trained and nursery of plant saplings was readied at their homes. Later, in phase 2, the prepared plants were donated. With the joint efforts of Chirag, Shikhar, Anish, Prakhar, Vibhav, Parany, Suhani, Sumbul, Nausheen, Mohamad Saquib, Amit and Priya Mishra, this entire campaign emerged as a huge success and we got many positive responses from the residents, said Jaiswal.

18-08-2021||Lucknow||Defence Corridor: Aligarh node in UP becomes favourite destination of investors||Among six nodes of the Defence Corridor project of the Uttar Pradesh government, the Aligarh node has emerged as the favourite destination for industrialists to set up their units as all land earmarked for the project has been allotted to investors. The other five nodes are Agra, Jhansi, Chitrakoot, Kanpur and Lucknow. Now, the UP Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) has asked the state government to allot 30 acres more land for the Aligarh node of the Defence Corridor project. The UPEIDA is the nodal agency of the state government for executing the project. The entire 55.401 hectares land earmarked for the Aligarh node has already been allotted to 19 companies who will invest ₹1245.75 crore.“Entire land in Aligarh node has been allotted to 19 companies. All land in this node is sold out,” said Durgesh Upadhyay, media advisor, state government, UPEIDA. According the UPEIDA, more investors want land in the Aligarh node. Around 25 acres in this node will be used by the UPEIDA for developing public utilities. “We have asked the state government to allot 30 acres more land in the Aligarh node as more investors have expressed desire to set up their units here,” added Upadhyay. According to experts, investors prefer Aligarh node of the Defence Corridor due to its proximity to the national capital, New Delhi, and the national capital region (NCR). “The Aligarh node provides easy connectivity by road from New Delhi and the NCR. From Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi and the upcoming Noida International Airport, one can easily come down to Aligarh by road,” said an official of the UPEIDA. This is the reason why Aligarh node has become the most favoured destination for investors in the Defence Corridor, he added. The Defence Corridor would come up in Bundelkhand region and is expected to generate more than one lakh jobs. On February 21, 2018, PM Narendra Modi had announced ₹20,000 crore Defence Industrial Corridor in Bundelkhand region which is considered as one of the most backward regions in the state.

In the plea, he had requested the court to direct Punjab police to take the court’s permission before arresting him in any other offence, if added in the FIR registered in the corruption case. Appearing for Punjab, Sartej Singh Narula upon being asked by the court had submitted that the plea was “misconceived”. Subsequently, lawyers representing Saini decided to withdraw the plea as the court was not convinced with the contentions that it had raised. On August 12, the bench of justice Avneesh Jhingan had granted interim bail to Saini, subject to his joining investigation within one week in this case. On August 2, the Punjab vigilance bureau had registered a case under the Prevention of Corruption Act and criminal conspiracy against the former DGP along with six others, including an executive engineer with the public works department and his father Surinderjit Singh Jaspal, who owned the Sector-20 house in Chandigarh. The agency alleged that Saini had acquired the house in a fraudulent deal with fake documents, using questionable financial transactions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/corruption-case-ex-dgp-saini-withdraws-plea-from-hc-101629225879172.html
18-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: PGIMER finds Covid antibodies in 72.7% children||The final findings of the sero-survey of Chandigarh’s paediatric population, conducted by the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), revealed that 72.7% of the children, in the age group of 6 to 18, have acquired natural antibodies against Covid-19.The sero-survey, which examines how many people in a population have been infected with Covid-19 and recovered, is conducted by using an antibody test, also known as a serology test, that examines if an individual’s immune system has responded to the infection.PGIMER had started conducting the survey in Chandigarh on June 24. “Of the total 2,695 children tested, natural antibodies were found in 72.7% of them. The results also indicate that the antibody positivity rate in Chandigarh’s sector areas was 67%, followed by 75% in rural and 76% in colony areas,” said PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram.Dr Ram added, “Since the children below the age of 18 have not taken the vaccine, the antibodies prevalence shows that all of them were infected and recovered. Also, not many children in this age group were admitted, revealing that the infection rate was either moderate or mild. Also, most of the children were asymptomatic.”“Looking at the sero-survey results, we can say that children may not be the only population vulnerable to getting infected in the third wave. Children and adults in Chandigarh have the same antibodies level and the virus may infect anyone again,” he further said.PGIMER starts genome sequencingTo study variants of Covid-19 and infection trends in states, PGIMER has started conducting genome sequencing at hospital premises. Genome sequencing attempts to draw out the complete genetics of viruses.Giving details, Dr Jagat Ram said, “Initially, we have started testing 40 samples, results of which will be concluded in a week. These results will show us which Coronavirus variant (Alpha, Delta or Delta Plus) is dominant in Chandigarh and other neighbouring states. We will soon expand the sampling capacity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhpgimer-finds-covid-antibodies-in-72-7-children-101629225820277.html
18-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: BJP targets Shiv Sena over temples reopening||As malls, restaurants and bars, and local trains have opened their doors for people again, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday asked why the Uddhav Thackeray government is not reopening temples across the state, in an attempt to corner the Shiv Sena and question its credentials on the continuing curbs on temples.Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday said temples can be opened up by keeping social distancing measures in places. BJP legislator from Mumbai, Ram Kadam, took on the Sena, saying the decision to not allow temples to reopen is akin to “muzzling the voice of Hindus”.Speaking to reporters, Fadnavis said, “I do not understand the reason why temples are not being allowed to reopen. I think there will be less crowding in temples than in bars and malls. Temples can reopen by keeping social distancing norms in place. I have repeatedly said this that reopening temples is not needed just for religious reasons, but there is a large section of population that depends on temples and related activities for their livelihood.”Last year as the state government was unlocking various activities with Covid-19 cases on a decline, BJP leaders and workers held several protests and agitations demanding the reopening of temples and other places of worship. Last week, Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil had warned of agitation if the government does not reopen temples soon.Kadam, who demanded that temples should reopen, was stopped from leaving for Siddhivinayak temple on Tuesday. He said the government could have imposed strict rules on people going to places of worship and allowed them to reopen. He further alleged that the state opened malls, restaurants and bars as they give donations to the government. Kadam said he had left for Prabhadevi, where Siddhivinayak temple is located, but was stopped by police near his home in Khar. “You have put rules and standard operating procedures (SOP) for malls and bars, but temples have not been opened. If you put some strict rules for reopening of temples, it will be followed. Everything is now open in Maharashtra, including bars and liquor shops, but not temples. People have learnt to live with coronavirus now, but this coward government, which doesn’t step out of their homes [to govern], is not allowing people to live,” Kadam said.Reacting to BJP’s allegations and demands, Sena legislator and spokesperson Manisha Kayande said, “The BJP will demand reopening of all activities, but not follow any rules and Covid protocols. The BJP’s Jan Ashirwad Yatra is a Covid super spreader as none of the Union ministers were wearing masks, barring one [minister]. The government has opened up activities now as livelihood of thousands depends on it. It will open up temples as well, but not under pressure from them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-bjp-targets-shiv-sena-over-temples-reopening-101629225819191.html

The machines are 1.5 cubic metres in size as compared to diesel-run sweepers, which measure around 4.5 to 6 cubic metres,” said a senior SDMC official, who did not wish to be named.Currently, the civic body has 24 diesel-run mechanical sweepers. The proposal will now be placed in the corporation’s House for a final approval. The switch from diesel to electric mechanical sweepers has been made to opt for environment-friendly alternatives to mitigate dust, says the proposal. The SDMC claims to be the first civic body across the country to purchase these electrical machines. “Since this is a new technology, only a few companies are making these prototypes. It will take around three months, after getting the final approval, to procure these machines. However, we plan to do it before the onset of winter,” said the official. The battery-run machines will be charged at the several charging stations already set up by the civic body. A prototype of the machine was tested at Rajouri Garden market, said the official. Colonel (retd) B K Oberoi, chairman of SDMC’s standing committee, said it’s a major switch towards a clean fuel, which has become the need of the hour. “The SDMC is the first civic body to purchase these machines in the country. This is just a start towards using more electric-run equipment, which can help reduce the carbon footprint in the Capital. These machines are more effective and efficient in sucking up dust and has a good battery life of five years,” said Oberoi. As per the proposal, the machines will be purchased with the funds the SDMC receives under the Urban Development Fund (granted by the central government). However, it’s operational and maintenance cost of around ₹10,00, 26, 280 for a period of five years will be borne by the corporation itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/south-delhi-municipal-corporation-to-procure-electric-sweeping-machines-101629225578488.html

However, as of May 2021, nearly one-third or 32% of these children (1,40,556) were declared free of malnutrition.Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel initiated the campaign to eradicate malnutrition and anaemia in the state considering the rate of malnutrition and anaemia among women and children shown in the data of National Family Health Survey-4.As per the survey, 37.7% children below five years of age in the state were suffering from malnutrition and 47% women in the age group of 15 to 49 years were suffering from anaemia. It was observed that the maximum of the malnourished children was from tribal and remote forest areas.Furthermore, a pilot project called ‘Suposhan Abhiyan’ was started in some gram panchayats of the forest region, including Maoist-affected Bastar, which was carried forward through innovative programmes such as the distribution of hot nutritious food through panchayats in Dantewada district and 'Laika Jatan Thaur' in Dhamtari district. The government statement said that arrangements were made to provide hot-cooked food under Suposhan Abhiyan by ensuring better utilisation of the District Mineral Trust fund.Following the success of the scheme, Baghel expanded it throughout the state. Under this campaign, in addition to the supplementary nutritional food given to the identified children at the Anganwadi centre, arrangements have been made to distribute free nutritious food at local-level to the malnourished women and children.According to the government, nutritious food made from eggs, laddoos, gram, jaggery, sprouted grains, and milk, among others, along with hot-cooked food are also being provided to the beneficiaries. Awareness has also been created about locally available vegetables and nutritious items, as a result of which the nutrition-level of children and women has started improving.In collaboration with the health department, iron folic acid and anthelmintic tablets are also being provided to the anaemia-affected citizens. To achieve the goal of 'Malnutrition-free Chhattisgarh' in the next three years, the department of women and child development, health department and other departments’ are making coordinated efforts to bring about results, the statement said.Despite the closure of all Anganwadi and mini Anganwadi centres due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-inducted pandemic, ASHA workers and assistants of 51,455 such centres in the state distributed ready-to-eat nutritious food to 28.78,000 beneficiaries at their doorstep.Under the ‘Supplementary Nutrition Food Programme’, ready-to-eat food items are being distributed to the children of age group six months to six years, pregnant, lactating women and adolescent girls.Anganwadi centres have now been reopened with the consent of the public representatives and parents in the Covid-19-free places in the state. This decision to reopen Anganwadis was taken to maintain the victory over malnutrition and to prevent the impact of Covid-19 on the health of children, the government’s statement further said.Under the Mukhyamantri Suposhan Abhiyan, in Balod district, 12,481 children were identified malnourished as of January 2019, out of which 1,402 children have been cured. Similarly, 6,032 children out of 30,917 in Balodabazar have been cured of the condition. In Balrampur-Ramanujganj district, 14,106 children out of 27,352 have been cured while in Bastar, 3,633 children out of 15,753 have been free of malnourishment.The government statement further stated that similar improvements in the number of children suffering from malnourishment have been reported from other districts of the state as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-campaign-helped-curtail-malnourishment-in-children-by-32-in-chhattisgarh-101629225096649.html
18-08-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC relief for Muharrum procession on August 20 in south Mumbai||The Bombay high court (HC) granted limited relief to a section of Shia Muslim devotees and allowed seven trucks to accompany the taziya from Dongri to Mazagaon cemetery on August 20 on Moharrum. Last year, the HC had allowed only one truck to carry the taziya with five people on board. This year each truck can be accompanied by up to 15 persons. The court has, however, imposed strict conditions such as ensuring that the 15 persons on each truck are fully vaccinated and 14 days have lapsed since the last dose was taken, and also restricted entry into the cemetery to only 25 persons when the procession ends. The court also restrained devotees from coming on roads and following the trucks, which is similar to last year’s order. The court also directed the petitioner to furnish a list with details of participants to the deputy commissioner of police of the area concerned by August 19 afternoon. The procession has to be taken out and completed between 4pm and 7pm and will have to be recorded to ensure there are no violations of the conditions. The division bench of justice KK Tated and justice PK Chavan, while hearing a petition filed by All India Idara Tahafuz e Hussainiyat, an organisation which represents a section of the Shia community in Mumbai, was informed that in light of various relaxations permitted by the state, directions should be issued to permit conduction of Muharram rituals with Covid-19 protocols. The petition also sought relief against the August 9 government decision which disallowed Muharram processions and sought permissions for taking out processions for two hours each day between August 18 and 20. The August 9 circular, while permitting setting up of sabeels (water distribution counters) that could be manned by no more than two persons to distribute water in sealed bottles, had restricted processions in light of the ban imposed on social and religious programmes by the Centre and the state government. While making submissions on Tuesday, senior advocate Rajendra Shirodkar for the organisation said the petition was seeking permission for a limited number of persons to participate in the procession, and that persons who have taken a single dose of Covid-19 vaccine should be permitted to participate. Shirodkar also referred to the permission granted to devotees to go to Pandharpur in buses to celebrate Ashadhi Ekadashi festival following Covid-19 protocols. However, government pleader Purnima Kantharia opposed the petition and said, as religious processions would see a huge number of people participating, the police would have to requisition forces from all zones to control the crowd, and hence it was not advisable to permit a procession during the pandemic. She added that the relaxations permitted by the state have been conditional and access to hotels and malls was only for people who have taken both the vaccine doses, and hence the same should be applied to the participants of the procession as well. On a query by the court, Kantharia submitted that on a full sized truck not more than 15 persons can be allowed and organisers should ensure that there is no crowding at the cemetery as well. After hearing the submissions, the court warned the organisation of strict action in case of violation of conditions and asked them to give an undertaking that the rituals would be conducted by following social distancing and Covid norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-relief-for-muharrum-procession-on-august-20-in-south-mumbai-101629225459137.html

According to police officials from the two neighbouring states, the firing took place at around 2 am on Tuesday at Darashing Hills area under reserve forest in Assam. One person from Mizoram has sustained injuries but it was not due to firing, police said. According to the superintendent of police of Hailakandi district, Gaurav Upadhyay, at around 2 am on Tuesday, police officials noticed that some people have entered Assam and were using some sort of signals with torch lights. He said Assam police officials asked them why did they enter when suddenly some people started firing from the upper side of the hill on the Mizoram side. In return, Assam police fired 12 rounds of blank shots after which the entrants ran away. “First of all, we did not start the firing, our officials were attacked with bullets from the upper side of the hill which is under Mizoram. Ordinary civilians do not cross the border silently at 2:00 am, so it appears these people were up to something fishy. Our officials did not fire on them as we have them instructed not to do it. Now some wrong messages are being given from the Mizoram’s side which should not be done,” Upadhyay said. He also said that the area where these three people were stopped falls under Assam and it is not a disputed part of the border. “If this was a disputed area, higher officials would have intervened by now,” he added. Superintendent of police of Mizoram’s Kolasib district, Vanlalfaka Ralte, informed that three residents of Vairengte area of Kolasib district were attempting to go to their friend’s house in Bilaipur village of Assam’s Hailakandi when Assam police threatened them with bullets. “In bordering areas, people are friends with each other and they exchange things amongst them. Three Mizoram residents, including two ladies, were going to a friend’s house on Monday night when Assam police threatened them with bullets. One lady has sustained severe injury but that is not due to the bullet. She broke her leg while running because of fear. This is unfortunate that Assam police tried to use bullets on innocent civilians of Mizoram,” he said.According to a Mizoram DIPR release, deputy commissioner of Kolasib, H Lalthlangliana, has appealed to Mizoram’s public to avoid visiting border areas where police are deployed in order to eschew brewing up of tension. He also urged people not to spread fake news which could lead to fresh tension along with the border areas. A firing incident happened between the police of both the states at Lailapur area in Cachar district along the border on July 26 killing six Assam police jawans. After that, the locals on Assam’s side imposed an unofficial economic blockade for 10 days. After several talks between the two states, the blockade was removed and peace prevailed in border areas. Police from both states are keeping vigil at the border areas post the July 26 incident.Recently, a school in Hailakandi district near the border was bombed by unknown miscreants. While Assam police claimed that the miscreants came from Mizoram, the Mizoram police demanded a neutral investigation on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fresh-firing-along-assam-mizoram-border-in-hailakandi-district-one-mizo-civilian-injured-101629225400865.html

The Delhi government has been undertaking comprehensive streetscaping projects on major road stretches across the city to beautify and decongest them. Recently, a small stretch of the BRT corridor has been redeveloped on a pilot basis.  A senior PWD official said the space underneath the Lajpat Nagar flyover is currently encroached by the homeless, who will be shifted to nearby shelters. The space will then be used to develop a sports complex like facility.The official said the project is in the planning stages. In order to ensure the safety of visitors, there will be special crossings and zebra poles. For security, the sports complex will have iron gates, and illuminated with LED lights. There will also be seating provisions for visitors and the elderly. As a part of the streetscaping project, officials said they will be inspecting the spots where traffic jams are reported and try to widen the stretches, wherever possible. The drainage system too will be repaired as a part of the project, which would help solve the issue of waterlogging. The pipelines will be dug deeper and a close vigil will be kept on those dumping garbage anywhere, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pwd-to-build-sports-complex-below-lajpat-nagar-flyover-101629225399652.html

The current market trend is very remunerative for farmers,” said CCI assistant general manager and Punjab in-charge Neeraj Kumar, adding that this time, the central agency was unlikely to play any major role in cotton purchase, but it will ensure its presence in the market to stabilise pricing. The CCI buys cotton only if private buyers pay farmers less than the MSP. Of 55 lakh quintal produced last season, CCI procured a record 27 lakh quintal on MSP in the state. Cotton harvesting in the state is expected to commence from September 15. In the last fiscal (2020-21), the MSP for cotton varieties grown in Punjab was ₹5,725 per quintal. For this kharif season, the Centre has enhanced MSP on cotton by ₹200 onwards on different staple sizes. A notification of MSP on long-medium varieties sown in Punjab has not been issued yet. Cotton is the economic lifeline of farmers in the semi-arid belt of south Malwa as the crop is sown in eight districts, mainly in Fazilka, Mansa, Bathinda and Muktsar. With over 3 lakh hectare under area cotton, southern Punjab has recorded an increase of 17% than 2020 when cotton was sown on 2.5 lakh hectare.Director of Indian Cotton Association Limited, a body of those dealing in export, spinning, ginning of cotton, Rakesh Rathi said the situation in the international and domestic market indicates that raw cotton may fetch farmers ₹500-700 per quintal above the MSP.“Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the textile industry was among the worst-hit sectors in 2020. Later, demand for cotton or yarn in the market increased. The CCI played an important role in stocking up after paying a better price to cotton growers. This time, private players may buy the entire stock at competitive rates to meet demand,” said Rathi.A progressive farmer from Bathinda’s Bajak village Baldev Singh said like last season, the cotton-growing area did not witness any major pest attack and an average yield of 10 quintal per acre is expected. “Farmers are looking for good returns for their crop,” he added.A leading cotton ginner from Muktsar Bhagwan Bansal said the climate was highly conducive for the cash crop and a bumper yield is expected. “Bangladesh, the hub of international textile sector, has shown huge demand for Indian raw cotton and thread due to our quality. Competitive rates will motivate farmers to cover more area under cotton next season,” Bansal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cotton-farmers-in-for-a-good-season-cci-hopes-it-doesn-t-have-to-intervene-101629225399138.html

In the upcoming auction too, the excise department estimates an average premium of 10% over reserve price of license set for each zone,” said a senior excise department official who asked not to be named.This will mark a new record for the Capital, and push annual earnings growth rate from the current 5-7% to over 30% -- highlighting that a new excise policy, which aims to reform the city’s liquor business by improving user experience, cleaning up the liquor mafia and eradicating pilferage, is making an impact within two months of being adopted.The average revenue of the city over the past three years stood at around ₹5,500 crore annually, according to government data. The new policy was implemented on June 11.The 12 zones to be put up for auction include localities such as Sarita Vihar, Shakarpur, Dakshinpuri, Anand Vihar, Tagore Garden, Vikaspuri, Trilokpuri-East, Badarpur, Timarpur, Nawada, Matiala, Rithala, Pitampura, Paschim Vihar, Lajpat Nagar, Jama Masjid, Paharganj, Najafgarh, Punjabi Bagh, Kasturba Nagar, Shastri Park, Mukherjee Nagar, Alipur, Narela, Ashok Vihar, IP Extension, Abul Fazl Enclave, Laxmi Nagar, Kalyanpuri, Sadar Bazar, Sriniwaspuri, Ballimaran, Deoli and Pratap Nagar.Under the new policy, retailers are free to decide the selling prices in a competitive environment, rather than an MRP being mandated by the government. Each zone will have at least 27 liquor vends — all of which will go to one successful bidder.When the first set of auction opened earlier this month the reserve bidding price was set at ₹221 crore for each zone on an average but the licences were awarded at an average premium of 20% with the average bid price being Rs. 265 crore, said the official.The highest bid was received for the New Delhi zone at a 45% premium of ₹315 crores -- which includes areas such as Connaught Place and Janpath.Tenders for the bids were first floated on June 28, soon after the government implemented the new excise policy on June 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/auction-of-12-liquor-retail-zones-in-delhi-from-august-25-101629225339212.html

We can’t direct judicial inquiry at this stage…When they have constituted the SIT, let them do their work. You can’t presuppose..,” the court said.Advocate Sanjay Lao, standing counsel (criminal), Delhi government, told the court that an SIT comprising five members including two assistant commissioners of police (ACPs) has been constituted for the case.Lao, representing the Delhi police, said round the clock security is being provided to the parents in the wake of the alleged threat to their lives.Lao said, “DCP, crime branch has constituted the SIT. There are two ACPs. The prayer has been fulfilled. The probe is being monitored by the high-ranking officials of Delhi Police”.Lao also said that two accused persons have admitted to the crime and provisions for alleged commission of offences of murder and rape under the Indian Penal Code, section 6 under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 have been added to the FIR.He said a judicial probe cannot be ordered at this stage because the matter has yet not been decided and the alleged laxity could be established only if the accused are acquitted.However, advocate Jitendra Kumar Jha, who was representing the girl’s parents, said that the SIT has not been functioning properly “as they did not seek the custody of the four accused for nine days after their arrest”.Taking note of the submissions, the court asked the police to file a status report indicating the progress of the investigation and posted the matter for hearing in October. “Status report be filed so as to know the stage of the investigation,” the judge said.In their plea, the girl’s parents said that there was a delay in lodging the FIR as they were made to sit in the police station in between the intervening night of Aug 1-2.The petition claimed that even though the police reached the crematorium, their focus was to “hush up” the case. They said that they were forced by the police for not saying anything about the rape or murder, and instead say that their daughter died due to electrocution.The parents have said that despite the case being transferred to the crime branch, they do not have faith in the present investigation and truth can only be proved by a court-monitored SIT. They also sought judicial probe against the police officers who allegedly reached the spot late and delayed registration of an FIR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dalit-girl-s-rape-murder-hc-refuses-to-order-judicial-enquiry-police-set-up-sit-101629225159151.html

Another officer, Vedprakash Rai, who has been made the SHO of the station, will investigate the case now, police said.Before attempting suicide, the woman, along with her associate, recorded a Facebook live video, in which she disclosed her identity and alleged that she had filed the sexual assault case against the BSP MP. She also said that some senior police officers and others were supporting the MP.Police suspect that she attempted suicide as she feared being farmed in fraud cases levelled against her.The MP was arrested and has been in judicial custody in the sexual assault case since the last two years. In December 2020, the woman had filed another complaint against the MP and his associate, Sudhir Singh, at Lanka police station in Varanasi, alleging that the two were defaming her and running a propaganda on social media.

Ocean freight rates have risen at least 3.5-fold (250%) over the past six months and the local industry, which accounts for a major chunk of the country’s exports, says shipments are either being delayed or held back. The industry has also written to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) to address the crisis. A combination of factors has led to the higher shipping costs, with soaring demand amid stimulus packages the key. Saturated ports and not enough ships, dockworkers and truckers has aggravated the situation. Easing of restrictions after the second Covid wave is another contributing factor. From Ludhiana, yarn forms the major chunk of exports at about 25,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent unit) a year. Of this, hosiery accounts for 4,500 TEUs; export of rice follows at 2,000 TEUs. Export of bicycles, spare parts, auto-part components and engineering goods add another 1,700 TEUs. “For some destinations, the freight has increased between 500% and 600% (six-seven times); this increase is for the west coast of the US and Latin America. Cities such as Los Angeles and Seattle are affected. Even as we are ready to pay the higher rate, vessels are not available as ports are congested. There is a waiting time of two-three weeks in countries along the west coast. Shipping lines are minting profits, with the only silver lining being that our main competitor, China, is also in the same boat,” said Amit Thapar, vice-chairman, Confederation of Commerce and Industry (CII), Punjab. Upkar Singh Ahuja, president, Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertaking (CICU), said, “Our Export Promotion Committee is working to resolve issues of members with the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), under the Union ministry of commerce.” Sarvjit Singh, co-convener, export committee, CICU, said a consignment to East Africa which used to cost $1,400 ( ₹10.5 lakh) is now costing $4,800 ( ₹36 lakh). He added, “Shipping companies are charging huge amounts and exporters have to pay up for the fear of losing customers. The nexus between top officials of shipping lines and some freight forwarders is behind the steep increase in ocean freight rates. If the practice continues, exporters might have to shut shop. Rates gone up to 250% (3.5 times), which is forcing exporters to delay or hold the shipment.”An export committee member, chartered accountant Abhilesh Aneja, said the average container price (40 feet) from India to the US has risen 3-5 times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ocean-freight-up-3-fold-over-six-months-ludhiana-s-exporters-raise-red-flag-101629224680127.html
18-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Flyover on busy Ring Road to be shut for 40 days for repair||Traffic jams on the busy Ring Road may worsen during the peak hours as the Nauroji Nagar flyover that connects connects Aurobindo Marg, AIIMS to Moti Bagh, near Sarojini Nagar, will remain closed for traffic for at least 40 days for repairs, public works department officials said on Tuesday.They said the expansion joints of the flyover that allow for continuous traffic between bridge structures have not been repaired in the last five years, and required immediate maintenance. The PWD submitted the plan to the Delhi traffic police on two weeks ago for the work.The traffic police approved the plan on Sunday, and the work began on Monday night, PWD officials said.A senior PWD official said work has begun on the carriageway from Moti Nagar to AIIMS. The traffic police has allowed the work for 40 days, but officials said it could be extended.The repair work could potentially trigger traffic jams on the busy stretch that is used by nearly 100,000 vehicles every day. The PWD official said in order to cause minimum trouble to the commuters, the work will be taken up in different phases.In the first phase, work has begun on one carriageway, and it is expected to be completed by September 5. The repair on the other carriageway -- from AIIMS to Moti Bagh -- will begin on September 6 and will be finished by September 25, the official explained.“The work is sure to increase the traffic problems in the area but more traffic cops have been deployed in the area to man the traffic, in order to ensure the jams are not prolonged. The only time when jams are likely to increase is during peak hours. More than 1,00,000 vehicles cross the stretch during peak hours every day. In the first phase of this project, the expansion joints of the flyover will be changed. The entire round of repairing work will be done in phases,” said a PWD official.In the third phase, repair work will also be carried out on the Africa Avenue flyover, on the carriageway from AIIMS to Moti Bagh between September 26 and October 15, he said.PWD officials said these stretches are riddled with potholes due to heavy rain, and the road surface here has to be resurfaced.The traffic police are yet to issue specific diversions for the repair project. They have advised commuters going towards AIIMS and South Extension, from areas such as Naraina, Delhi Cantt, Dhaula Kuan, and Moti Bagh, to avoid this route.“As of now, no diversions have been made on any of these stretches, as we feel the volume of traffic can be managed. The traffic is being directed to a service lane underneath the flyover. If the need arises, we will make a proper diversion plan and implement it immediately,” said a senior traffic police officer.Ring Road was among 25 stretches across the city where reports of traffic jams continuing beyond peak hours were received by the traffic police control room between June 1 and June 25, a peculiar phenomenon that was witnessed when the traffic movement resumed after the second lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhiflyover-on-busy-ring-road-to-be-shut-for-40-days-for-repair-101629224378289.html
18-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi: RTO coming up at Jharoda Kalan, to have automated test track||The Delhi government is soon going to inaugurate a regional transport office (RTO) in southwest Delhi’s Jharoda Kalan, said a senior government official on Tuesday. This will be the 14th RTO to be inaugurated in Delhi and the 10th one with an automated track for driving test.“The new RTO will cater to areas of outer Delhi near Najafgarh. Earlier, residents of this part of southwest Delhi had to go either to Dwarka or Janakpuri to get a driving licence made or for other transport related work,” said the senior official adding that a separate RTO for the zone has been a long pending demand due to overcrowding in the existing facilities.While the new RTO was ready in terms of infrastructure, the government was confronted with a manpower shortage because of the Covid-19 pandemic, which is slowly getting stable, the official said.The last time Delhi got a new RTO was around 10 years ago when the Surajmal Vihar RTO was made operational to cater to east Delhi areas such as Shahdara, Anand Vihar and Vishwas Nagar.In the coming months, the RTOs in Lado Sarai and Dwarka too are likely to get automated test tracks.Tests on automated tracks are much more stringent. Unlike conventional tests, in which drivers have to drive on a track amid traffic in the presence of a motor vehicle inspector, the automated tracks simulate tougher driving conditions.The tests are monitored by sensor-based cameras, the video is live-streamed in a control room at the spot and evaluation is done by a computer software. The result is generated after taking into consideration instances of the total time taken, unscheduled stops, the number of times the applicant hit a kerb or go off track. Any driver who scores below 70% has to reappear for the test after a certain time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhirto-coming-up-at-jharoda-kalan-to-have-automated-test-track-101629223658008.html

18-08-2021||Pune||Dhalewadi village has an organ donor in every family||PUNE Dhalewadi village, in Purandar taluka of Pune district, has by registered at least one member from every family in the village to be an organ donor. Within two days the village saw 350 donors registered, which has raised the organ donation numbers for the Pune zone, said officials. The Pune Zonal Transplant coordination committee, which covers nine districts, was able to register only 100 donors a month. This has now gone up to 450 donors in a month, thanks to this village.Aarti Gokhale, central coordinator, Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee, said, “Even if we try to persuade people by actually visiting the person’s house, we could not get even a 100 organ donors registered in a year in the entire zone. However, with this one village registering close to 350 organ donors in one day our numbers have pushed higher. Due to the lockdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, we were not able to carry out awareness camps and distribute our forms. This is why we launched our QR code, the first of its kind in the state, which made it easier for people to register as organ donors by just scanning at the code. Since its launch in June, we were able to get close to 100 donors from the entire zone until now, and within the two days that this village started registering donors - on both August 13 and August 15 - we could get 350 donors registered and the count in Pune zone went up to 450.” Pune zone consists of nine districts, Pune, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Solapur, Ahmednagar, Nashik, Dhule and Jalgaon.Vandana Kalane, gram panchayat member from the village said, “We will not stop at just 350 and we will be registering each and every member for organ donation. We have about 250 families and a population of 1,500 in the village. With this we have at least one member from every family registered as an organ donor. In addition to just filling out forms we also have two members who signed as witnesses. Although the donor has willingly registered, after the death a family member has the right to deny despite the registration. By registering all the eligible members in the villages, anyone aged between 18-80 years, we will also create awareness among all to be registered as donors so that even after a person is brain dead the organ donation process can be smooth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/at-least-one-from-every-family-in-dhalewadi-village-to-be-organ-donor-101629217776939.html

He has since also been the vice-chancellor of the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), just after he returned from his Afghan assignment. Excerpts.What is your reaction to the current happenings and situation in Afghanistan?This is the most unfortunate thing to happen and it is a black day not only for Afghanistan, but I would say for humanity. What is happening out there is extremely saddening and the future looks very scary. My major worry is what happens to all the women and young girls, there is a big question. The younger generation has so many aspirations in Afghanistan and how will they go forward with their careers. There is a strong bond between India and Afghanistan and every year, thousands of Afghan students come to India for education. How will that be affected now?When I was the vice-chancellor of the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), the then prime minister Manmohan Singh had announced a scheme under which 1,000 Afghan students were invited to India and the Indian government financed them for a four-year course in whichever university they wanted. Since then, the number of students coming to India for various studies has gone up and it will definitely be affected now. All these engagements and schemes will come to a halt after the Taliban. Taliban do not believe in the kind of education we have and I really don’t know what would happen to Afghan students studying in India. I think the Indian government should positively respond to students’ issues, mainly about their visa extensions. Sending them back on technical reasons would be very unfortunate. What was your experience working in Kabul 2006?The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) gave me permission to go to Afghanistan as the country was coming out of 23 years of devastation of war. In every family there was at least one death in the war, so the backbone of the country was broken. We were there to restore democracy and many Afghans who had gone abroad were returning to build their nation. People were in a lot of agony and Americans were running the country. America had given a contract to the USAID organisation that was running the entire show, so they appointed me as chief economic counsellor for the Government of Da Afghanistan Bank in Kabul.So there was a team of Americans, Afghans and myself working together. I was in charge of the team to rebuild the economy. For few months I was staying inside a secured walled compound as there were all kinds of security issues. Every day some explosion would take place. I decided their exchange rates on day-to-day basis, interest rates and I trained lot of Afghan people on monetary policies. There was a huge vacuum of trained people and I was there to teach them. Your memories of Afghan culture, the people and their social life…Going out was ruled out for us being a security threat. To move from one place to another when necessary they would take us in armed vehicles with high security. Initially I was given Z plus security and an American soldier was my bodyguard, it made me a direct target. Later on, a local Afghan soldier was my bodyguard. The Afghans are a beautiful people with a great culture and there are lot of similarities with our culture. When I was coming back to India for a short period one of my servants requested me to bring back a CD of ‘Kyunki Sans bhi Kabhi Bahu thi’ serial. Afghan people are fond of Indian cinema and serials and they just love our Bollywood industry and Indian culture. What do you look see happening to Afghanistan now that the Taliban has taken control?It is a false state government now and we don’t know… a terrorist university or centre may come up there. Talibans are known for that. Pakistan along with Taliban combining in terms of terrorism will be a major threat to India and we need to watch out!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pakistan-combining-with-taliban-in-terms-of-terrorism-major-threat-to-india-101629217596837.html
18-08-2021||Pune||No Zika infected mosquito reported in Purandar: state surveillance officer||PUNE State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said on Tuesday that so far, the National Institute of Virology (NIV) has not reported a single Zika-infected mosquito from samples from Belasar village, ground zero for the Zika virus in the state.Despite just one confirmed case of Zika having been reported in the state, the administration is still continuing with its surveillance of cases and destruction of larvae. The taluka health officer said that although an official order is awaited, the NIV has not reported any infected mosquito, the primary vector for the Zika virus.Following the Zika virus case reported on July 31 from Belasar village in Purandar taluka, multiple teams were sent from the state as well as the central government to collect samples and advise the local health administration on better surveillance. Earlier, a central team had sent samples of mosquitoes along with blood samples of symptomatic patients to check for the infection. One theory on the possible means of infection is traders from across the country, including Kerala which has reported an outbreak of the Zika infection. An infected mosquito can spread the Zika infection to at least 17 more people, along with dengue and chikungunya as well. Dr Pradeep Awate said, “Until now, the samples of mosquitoes that we have sent to NIV have tested negative for the Zika virus, however, this is a continuous process and we will send more samples if need be, to be sure that there is no threat of the spread. The central team has asked us to keep up the survey till there are zero cases of dengue and chikungunya in all the six villages that fall within the Zika virus radar. Dr Ujjawala Jadhav, Purandar taluka health officer said, “We had begun with the fogging process and destruction of larvae even before the first case of Zika virus was reported on July 31, because of the number of dengue and chikungunya cases being reported. After the Zika case was reported, the central team visited the spot and collected samples of mosquitoes. The NIV team has informed us that they have not got any infected mosquitoes. Overall, mosquitoes in the village have gone down because of our continuous action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/no-zika-infected-mosquito-reported-in-purandar-state-surveillance-officer-101629217057669.html

18-08-2021||Dehradun||AAP names Col Kothiyal Uttarakhand CM candidate||Dehradun: A month after promising 300 units of electricity free if the Aam Aadmi Party comes to power in next year’s assembly elections in Uttarakhand, the party’s national coordinator and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, on Tuesday announced Col Ajay Kothiyal (Retd) as AAP’s chief ministerial candidate. He also announced that AAP will make Uttarakhand the spiritual capital for Hindus across the world.Uttarakhand is ruled by a Bharatiya Janata Party government that has seen three CMs -- both changes have come in the past year -- with the Congress as the principal opposition. Kejriwal, who is on a day-long visit to Dehradun, said the people of Uttarakhand don’t want politicians but a patriot army man like Col Ajay Kothiyal, who has fought for the country, battled terrorists, carries two bullets in his body, and played a major role in the reconstruction of the Kedarnath after the 2013 tragedy. “Sometimes back (AAP leader and Delhi deputy CM) Manish Sisodia came here to find out who people here wanted as the CM . We carried out many surveys. And we got an overwhelming response from Col Kothiyal. People said we don’t want leaders, we want a patriot, who thinks about Uttarakhand, its people and Mother India,” he said and added, “So it is the choice of people of Uttarakhand.”AAP has sought to revive its national ambitions in recent months. In June, he said the party would have a Sikh chief ministerial candidate when it contests the Punjab elections next year. “Punjab is looking for a new brand of politics,” he said then, inducting former IGP Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh into the party. The party has also set its sights on Gujarat, which goes to the polls later that year. In both states, the party has promised units of free electricity if it comes to power. Kothiyal joined AAP in April this year in the presence of AAP state unit president SS Kaler at an event in Haridwar. The party, which plans to contest all 70 seats in the state, is banking on Kothiyal’s army background and his popularity in the state for his significant contribution to the reconstruction work of the Kedarnath shrine after the 2013 tragedy. “If we want to do something good in the state, we have to bring the AAP model of governance to Uttarakhand. I was impressed by this model and that is why I joined AAP to implement this model here,” Kothiyal said Tuesday.Political analyst Prof MM Semwal, who teaches political science at Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University said that though AAP is aggressively trying to gain a foothold in Uttarakhand politics, it remains to be seen how the party performs at the ground level. “Uttarakhand has been primarily dominated by BJP and Congress. AAP still has to create a cadre like BJP and Congress in the state. But they can dent both BJP and Congress in some areas with their youth connect and major poll announcements”, he saidDuring his July visit, Kejriwal promised to replicate AAP’s Delhi model of governance in Uttarakhand. He added that if the party came, it would bring about a major change in the state’s education and health infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/aap-announces-cm-candidate-for-2022-u-khand-assembly-elections-101629194313691.html
18-08-2021||World||India will be guided by its ties with Afghan people: Jaishankar||India is watching the evolving situation in Kabul closely but it is focused currently on the safety and security of Indian citizens, external affairs minister S Jaishankar told reporters on Wednesday.Jaishankar added that India’s approach to the new dispensation there will be guided by its relationship with the Afghan people. “We are like everybody else very carefully following developments in Afghanistan,” the minister said when asked about the situation unfolding in that country, adding, “I think our focus is on ensuring the security in Afghanistan and the safe return of Indian nationals who are there.”Jaishankar spoke to reporters after chairing a UN Security Council meeting on peacekeeping in New York.To a question if India will engage with a Taliban or Taliban-dominated government in Kabul, the external affairs minister, said, “I think that the relationship with the Afghan people obviously (is) continuous and that will guide our approach to Afghanistan in the coming days. At this time, I think these are early days. Our focus right now is on ensuring the safety and security of Indian nationals.”India has had long historical ties with Afghanistan and since 2001, after the fall of Taliban 1.0, it has extended development assistance worth an estimated $3 billion covering an entire range of areas - from health, banking, water, power generation, transportation and reconstructing schools. It also built Afghanistan’s new parliament.Pressed by another reporter on whether India has had contacts with the Taliban in recent days, the minister said, “We are looking at what is the evolving situation in Kabul, obviously the Taliban, and its representatives have come to Kabul so I think we need to take it on from there.”The ministry of external affairs had indicated some contacts with the Taliban in response to news reports of an exchange of messages. It had said India was in contact with “various stakeholders” in Afghanistan but that was in June, before the Taliban had begun their swift march back to power in Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-will-be-guided-by-its-ties-with-afghan-people-jaishankar-101629308860262.html
18-08-2021||World||Islamic 'scholars' to decide on women’s 'right' to education: Taliban leader||Senior Taliban leader Waheedullah Hashimi said on Wednesday that Afghan women’s right to work and education would be decided by Ulemas or Islamic scholars. "Our ulema (scholars) will decide whether girls are allowed to go to school or not," Hashimi told news agency Reuters on Wednesday.Hashmi said Islamic scholars would take a call on how women are required to dress under the new Taliban regime. "They will decide whether they should wear hijab, burqa, or only (a) veil plus abaya or something, or not. That is up to them," Hashimi added.Just a day before, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid had declared at the Taliban's first media conference following their siege of Kabul that women would play an active role in Afghan society “but within the framework of Islam”. Mujahid had also said that women will be allowed to study and work in Afghan society. However, just hours later the Islamist militant group had reportedly killed a woman for not covering her head in public, the New York Post reported.The Taliban had assured women and international organisations that they would continue to enjoy the rights guaranteed under Islamic law. However, just this week news agency Reuters reported that Taliban fighters had walked into the offices of two prominent banks in Herat and Kandahar and asked the women working there to not return to their jobs. Radio Presenter Shabnam Dawran said in a video shared on Twitter on Wednesday that she was turned away from her job at Afghanistan's state-owned Radio Television Afghanistan. "They told me that the regime has changed. You are not allowed, go home," she said.Armed members of the insurgent group have been going around the country, knocking on the doors of residents, asking them to return to their jobs. On Wednesday morning three armed men knocked at the door of 38-year old Wasima, who lives in the western city of Herat, took down her details, enquired about her job, remuneration, and asked her to resume working, reported Reuters.The Taliban, during its earlier regime between 1996 and 2001, had imposed strict Islamic law and prohibited women from studying or working, and made it mandatory for all women to be accompanied by a male relative in public. With the return of the regime after 20 years of battle with the US-led forces, Afghan women fear all the gains made in respect to women’s rights could be lost and suppressed, a fear which the international community, too, shares.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/islamic-scholars-to-decide-on-women-s-right-to-education-taliban-leader-101629307345479.html
18-08-2021||World||India calls for focus on technology in UN peacekeeping operations||India on Wednesday said the UN peacekeeping operations “must be anchored in a strong ecosystem of technology and innovation” to adapt to changing conflict dynamics and proposed a four-point framework at the Security Council that called, most importantly, for greater focus on “operationally proven, cost-effective, widely available, reliable and field-serviceable technologies”.At a meeting hosted by India, which holds the rotational presidency of the UN Security Council for August, and chaired by external affairs minister S Jaishankar, the body adopted a first-ever technology-related presidential statement in regard to peacekeeping - “Technology for Peacekeeping” - that called for recognising “technology has the potential to act as a force multiplier”.FOCUS ON ACCOUNTABILITYThe top UN body also adopted a resolution drafted by India - “Accountability of Crimes against UN Peacekeepers” - to protect peacekeepers from violence by calling upon member states that host them to take all appropriate measures, to “bring to justice perpetrators of the killing of, and all acts of violence against United Nations personnel”, to “promote accountability” and urged the secretary general to ensure member states did that by every means possible. The resolution was co-sponsored by all 15 members of the Security Council and was the first to be adopted unanimously, and it has also been supported by 80 members of the UN General Assembly.The meeting on peacekeeping is the second signature event India is hosting as UNSC president. The first was on maritime security which was chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who became the first Indian prime minister to chair a UNSC debate. The third is scheduled for Thursday, and it will be on counter-terrorism, to be chaired, once again, by Jaishankar.PEACEKEEPING IN 21ST CENTURY“Twenty-first century peacekeeping must be anchored in a strong ecosystem of technology and innovation that can facilitate UN peacekeeping operations in implementing their mandates in complex environments,” Jaishankar said. “After all, it helps them to adapt to changing conflict dynamics and take advantage of increased efficiencies.”Recalling the leading role played by India in UN peacekeeping operations as the country that has made the most sacrifices while participating in these missions and whose men and women are currently deployed in nine missions around the world, Jaishankar said, “To execute their mandates, peacekeeping missions must be able to move fast to acquire and validate, information from a wide range of openly available sources to enhance situational awareness, augment security, aid operational planning, and support decision-making.”The external affairs minister went on to announce a four-point point framework for securing UN peacekeepers to meet contemporary threats. “We must focus on operationally proven, cost-effective, widely available, reliable and field-serviceable technologies,” the minister said, adding, “These must also prioritise mobility, both in the sense of agile manoeuverability of mission assets and in the sense of use of mobile digital/IT platforms.”A sound information and intelligence foundation, he said, is the second point of his framework. And in this regard, he announced that India is supporting the UN in the roll-out of the UNITE Aware Platform across select peacekeeping missions. “This initiative is based on the expectation that an entire peacekeeping operation can be visualised, coordinated, and monitored on a real time basis,” the minister said, adding, “ We should ensure that any attack on a peacekeeper or a civilian is predictable, preventable, or responded to immediately.” It is being rolled out in four missions that are currently under way.Thirdly, the minister said, efforts must be made to ensure “technological improvements are continuous and are available on the ground, in the gear peacekeepers carry”; and fourthly, more attention should be paid to “consistent training and capacity building of peacekeepers in the realm of technology”.The minister had laid a wreath at the Peacekeepers Memorial on Wednesday morning along with UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres. CHALLENGES FOR UNGuterres also attended the meeting and briefed the member on the challenges and steps UN is taking. “UN peacekeeping was conceived in an analog world. It is now essential that it fully embraces … world in which we live, to improve the world’s agility, anticipation and responsiveness to conflicts, and to be able to address the challenges of today and tomorrow,” said Guterres, adding, “A shift in peacekeeping culture, as well as a systemic change are required for this new weapon.”Recalling the work done by peacekeepers in “world’s most severe circumstances, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US permanent representative to the UN, said, “They deserve the most advanced cutting edge technology to help them do this difficult job better, The right technology helps keep peacekeepers safe, and it helps them keep the communities they serve safe too. So it is our duty to ensure they have the technology and use it appropriately. After all, we all share responsibility for ensuring the safety and security of peacekeepers, as they in turn protect civilians.”In the Presidential Statement on “Technology for Peacekeeping”, which speaks for the Security Council, the top UN body called for recognising “technology has the potential to act as a force multiplier by enhancing performance, saving resources, simplifying work processes, and allowing peacekeeping missions to have a deeper understanding of the environments they operate in, through improved collection, analysis and dissemination of data”.The council “stresses the need to leverage the technological tools available to support greater situational awareness of peacekeeping missions and their front-line peacekeepers”, said the statement.The council “encourages better integration of existing and new technologies, especially digital technology … (and) continued efforts to enhance peacekeepers’ operational readiness and performance in the use of standardised technologies and services”.The statement urged the secretary-general to “continue to work with member states in exploring available and future technologies and best practices that can contribute towards the safety and security of peacekeepers and protection of civilians”.PROTECTING PEACEKEEPERSUnderscoring the importance of peacekeeping, the council adopted a resolution - “Accountability of Crimes against UN Peacekeepers” - condemned in “”the strongest terms” the killing of, and all acts of violence against United Nations personnel serving in peacekeeping operations, and their detention and abduction; and expressed “serious concerns regarding challenges in bringing to justice perpetrators saying “the rate of prosecution of such crimes has remained very low, which has further contributed to an environment of impunity, and undermined the safety and security of such personnel”.The resolution called upon member states that host peacekeepers to take all appropriate measures, to bring to justice perpetrators of the killing of, and all acts of violence against United Nations personnel; “promote accountability” for this violence; and urged the secretary general to ensure this accountability among member states. It also requested the top UN official to “establish a comprehensive online database” in this regard; and, finally, notify the relevant national authorities immediately upon receiving reports of the killing of, and all acts of violence against United Nations personnel.The resolution also suggested that every UN peacekeeping mission must have “a focal point for all issues related to the prevention, investigation and prosecution of violence against peacekeepers”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-calls-for-focus-on-technology-in-un-peacekeeping-operations-101629307359666.html

The UN health agency has also pointed out that the current data available does not suggest that a top-up shot against the disease is needed.The remarks came as the US government, earlier in the day, announced its plan to make available a booster shot for its people starting September 20 amid rising concerns due to the Delta variant of Covid-19. US officials have also warned that the protection offered by the vaccines waned over time, citing findings from recent assessments.However, top scientists at the WHO have expressed their objection to this plan, noting that some poorer countries do not have enough shots for even the first dose. WHO’s chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan on Wednesday said data indicated that booster shots were not needed. “We believe clearly that the data does not indicate that boosters are needed,” the Associated Press quoted her as saying.Also read | India gave 2L vaccines for UN peacekeepers: Jaishankar at tech platform launchThe chief scientist said that more research was needed regarding administering a booster shot. She further warned that the risk of newer variants of the disease emerging would increase if billions of people in the developing world were left unvaccinated. She also said that it could result in “even more dire situations.”Notably, Dr Swaminathan also warned earlier in the day that globally a surge in Delta variant of Covid-19 was observed in regions with less coverage of vaccines.Meanwhile, the executive director of the WHO health emergencies programme, Dr Michael Ryan, too, recorded his concerns regarding global vaccine distribution. “We’re planning to hand out extra life jackets to people who already have life jackets, while we’re leaving other people to drown without a single life jacket,” he said.Dr Bruce Aylward, senior advisor to WHO’s director-general on organizational change said “There is enough vaccine around the world, but it is not going to the right places in the right order.”He added that two doses of the vaccine should first be given to the “most vulnerable” people worldwide before delivering booster shots to those who are already fully inoculated, pointing out “We are a long, long way from that.”Further, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus too insisted on prioritising vaccine rollout globally before delivering boosters. “What is clear is that it's critical to get first shots into arms and protect the most vulnerable before boosters are rolled out,” he said.In response to the WHO’s concerns, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that the US is the biggest contributor to the global fight against the pandemic and will “continue to be the arsenal for vaccines.”US surgeon general Vivek Murthy also outlined that they “clearly see our responsibility to both, and we've got to do everything we can to protect people here at home while recognizing that tamping down the epidemic across the world is going to be key.”Last week, the US had announced its plan to provide a booster shot to people with weakened immune systems, which has now been expanded to include all people in the country. Earlier in the day, US officials, in a statement, said that people who were immunised with the Pfizer or the Moderna vaccines would need a booster dose eight months after taking the second doses, while they were awaiting data regarding Johnson and Johson’s vaccine.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-covid-19-vaccine-distribution-key-concern-for-who-experts-as-the-us-presses-on-with-plan-for-boosters-101629306668909.html

It cautioned that the Delta variant was spreading even in countries with high vaccination rates at the national level."Many of the places around the world where Delta is surging -- even in countries that at a national level have high levels of vaccination coverage -- the virus, the Delta variant itself, is really circulating in areas of low level of vaccine coverage and in the context of very limited and inconsistent use of public health and social measures," WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove told an online news briefing, reported Reuters.Also Read: US gives its nod for Covid-19 booster shot to counter declining vaccine efficacy over timeWHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told Reuters on Wednesday that Covid-19 vaccines offer protection against death and severe illness but cautioned that there’s no need for administering booster shots at the moment.

The research was carried out on four variants of concern: Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta on 13 antibodies grown in the lab from antibody growing cells in three vaccinated individuals. 12 of the 13 antibodies recognised Alpha and Delta, eight recognised all four variants, and one failed to recognise any of the four variants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-of-covid-19-spreading-in-low-vaccine-coverage-areas-says-who-101629303360285.html

Knowing the militant group is almost certain not to uphold the adoption agreements from the collapsed Afghan government, the American couple's best hope is to get the boy out, fast.“Once they get to the airport, it's just a matter of waiting time. But it's a matter of waiting a few hours or a few days,” Bahaudin Mujtaba said. Noman is currently in the custody of another family trying to leave.Maybe they can get the boy to a nearby country. Maybe Pakistan. Wherever they go, he's willing to fly there and meet him.“But the first goal is to get him out of Afghanistan safely,” Mujtaba said.It's unclear how many among the throngs of people trying to flee Afghanistan include potential adoptive children. One other US family, based in Indiana, is working with the same adoption agency as Mujtaba and is trying to get a 2-year-old boy out of the country.Mary King, executive director of Frank Adoption Center in Wake Forest, North Carolina, is working with the families and said they had full permission from Afghan courts to bring the children to the US and finalise the adoptions. They were awaiting US visas, but everything changed in the past few days.“This all came about much faster than any of us anticipated, so we don't know,” she said. “We have put them on every list. We've filled out every form we've been told about. Their names are everywhere we can get them, as far as with the appropriate US authorities. And so now we are waiting to hear what may happen next.”US adoptions from Afghanistan are relatively rare compared with adoptions from other countries, according to State Department data. From 1999 through 2019, 41 Afghan children were adopted by US families. That's far fewer than other countries in the region, including 148 children from Iran and 667 from Pakistan. Other countries, like China, Ukraine and Colombia, have seen thousands of children adopted by US families over the past two decades.The process in Afghanistan required working through the Afghan Family Court, which limited the guardianship process to Muslim parents. Families that receive permission from the court can then bring a child to the US to finalise an adoption, according to the State Department.But under Taliban rule, it's all but certain not to be permitted now, Mujtaba said, especially from a family based in the USMujtaba and his adoption agency have reached out to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's office for help. Mujtaba has even offered to go to Afghanistan with the US military, offering his familiarity with the language and culture in return for a chance to bring the boy home.Rubio's office confirmed it is working with Mujtaba and the adoption agency but did not offer more details about what options the senator's staff was pursuing.Mujtaba and his wife agreed to adopt Noman, a distant relative, after Mujtaba met him during a visit to Kabul five years ago.“I just basically fell in love with this little boy. And based on hearing everything, then we knew we had the means and the motivation to help him,” he said.The child's mother died of cancer, leaving the boy with his adult brothers and elderly father who is unable to care for him. Mujtaba described Noman as “a little boy who has big dreams.” He loves music, gets top grades in school and wants to become an engineer or a doctor -- a profession Mujtaba said the boy may be drawn to because he's had to meet with so many doctors.Noman appears to have diabetes and other medical issues, possibly stemming from nutrition problems, but Mujtaba said it's not totally clear if the doctors in Afghanistan gave him the right diagnosis or the treatments.“That's the environment, unfortunately, that you're in, in Afghanistan,” he said. “We're not really sure exactly what the problems might be, once we get here. He's fine for a period of time and then, unfortunately, he's not.”Mujtaba is an US citizen who emigrated from Afghanistan 40 years ago. After the Taliban was displaced two decades ago, he returned in 2005 to the country of his birth for the first time in 20 years. He's visited Noman 10 times over the past years, staying three to five weeks at a time.His wife, who is American, has never been to Afghanistan or met the boy in person because it seemed too dangerous to bring her, Mujtaba said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-families-mid-adoption-fear-taliban-might-not-uphold-agreements-try-to-get-afghan-children-out-101629301068381.html

China’s position on the Afghan issue is clear and consistent. We hope that Afghanistan can form an open, inclusive, and broadly representative government that echoes the widely shared aspirations of its own people and the international community,” Zhao said when asked about Beijing’s stand on recognising the Taliban government in Kabul.China, Zhao said hopes that all parties in Afghanistan would resolve differences through dialogue and consultation, avoid new conflicts and humanitarian disasters, and work towards smooth transition in the Afghan situation.“As a friendly neighbour to and sincere friend of Afghanistan, China upholds a friendly policy towards the entire Afghan people. This did not, does not and will not change. China will continue to support peace and reconstruction in Afghanistan, and provide help for socioeconomic development in Afghanistan as our ability permits,” the spokesperson said.Zhao reiterated that the Taliban should crack down on the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), which it has accused of fomenting unrest and separatism in China’s northwestern region of Xinjiang.Afghanistan and Xinjiang share a remote border of around 70km.“At the same time, we hope it will resolutely crack down on all kinds of terrorist forces, including the ETIM, and earnestly honour the commitment of not allowing any force to use Afghan territory to threaten the security of its neighbours,” he said.Beijing has strongly criticised what it calls the “hasty” retreat of US forces for the current instability in Afghanistan.China has sought good relations with both the former Afghan government and the Taliban, hosting the group’s top political leader, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, for talks with state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi in July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-wait-for-govt-formation-before-recognising-taliban-regime-101629297158997.html
18-08-2021||World||Taliban violently disperse rare protest in Jalalabad, killing 1 and wounding 6||The Taliban violently broke up a protest in eastern Afghanistan on Wednesday, killing at least one person as they quashed a rare public show of dissent. The militant group meanwhile met with former officials from the toppled Western-backed government.As officials work to shape a future government, the United Arab Emirates acknowledged that Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who fled the Taliban advance, and his family were in that country.The Taliban's every action in their sudden sweep to power is being watched closely. They insist they have changed and won’t impose the same draconian restrictions they did when they last ruled Afghanistan, all but eliminating women’s rights, carrying out public executions and harboring al-Qaida in the years before the 9/11 attacks.But many Afghans remain deeply skeptical, and the violent response to Wednesday's protest could only fuel their fears. Thousands are racing to the airport and borders to flee the country. Many others are hiding inside their homes, fearful after prisons and armories were emptied during the insurgents’ blitz across the country.Dozens of people gathered in the eastern city of Jalalabad to raise the national flag a day before Afghanistan's Independence Day, which commemorates the end of British rule in 1919. They lowered the Taliban flag — a white banner with an Islamic inscription — that the militants have raised in the areas they captured.Video footage later showed the Taliban firing into the air and attacking people with batons to disperse the crowd. Babrak Amirzada, a reporter for a local news agency, said he and a TV cameraman from another agency were beaten by the Taliban as they tried to cover the unrest.A local health official said at least one person was killed and six wounded. The official was not authorized to speak to media and so spoke on condition of anonymity.Meanwhile, videos from the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul, a stronghold of the Northern Alliance militias that allied with the US against the Taliban in 2001, appear to show potential opposition figures gathering there. It's in the only province that hasn't yet fallen to the Taliban.Those figures include members of the deposed government — Vice President Amrullah Saleh, who asserted on Twitter that he is the country’s rightful president and Defense Minister Gen. Bismillah Mohammadi — as well as Ahmad Massoud, the son of the slain Northern Alliance leader Ahmad Shah Massoud. It's unclear if they intend to challenge to the Taliban, who seized most of the country in a matter of days last week.The Taliban, meanwhile, pressed ahead with their efforts to form an “inclusive, Islamic government.” They have been holding talks with former Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, a senior official in the ousted government. Mohammad Yusof Saha, a spokesman for Karzai, said preliminary meetings with Taliban officials would facilitate eventual negotiations with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the top Taliban political leader, who returned to the country this week.Karzai and Abdullah met Wednesday with Anas Haqqani, a senior leader in a powerful Taliban faction. The US branded the Haqqani network a terrorist group in 2012, and its involvement in a future government could trigger international sanctions.Meanwhile, the UAE's Foreign Ministry acknowledged in a one-sentence statement that Ghani and his family were in the country for “humanitarian considerations” The President fled the Taliban advance on Sunday and disappeared amid widespread anger from Afghans over the collapse of the country’s security forces.The US Embassy in Abu Dhabi did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It was unclear if he’d received any other assistance. The UAE is a close US ally.Amid the uncertainty, thousands of Afghans have tried to flee the country in recent days, and the US and its allies have struggled to manage a chaotic withdrawal from the country.Hundreds of people were outside the airport early Wednesday. The Taliban demanded to see documents before allowing the rare passenger inside. Many of the people outside did not appear to have passports, and each time the gate opened even an inch, dozens tried to push through. The Taliban fired occasional warning shots to disperse them.In Kabul, groups of Taliban fighters carrying long guns patrolled a well-to-do neighborhood that is home to many embassies as well as mansions of the Afghan elite.The Taliban have promised to maintain security, but residents say groups of armed men have been going door to door inquiring about Afghans who worked with the Americans or the deposed government. It’s unclear if the gunmen are Taliban or criminals posing as militants.Another Taliban promise being closely watched is their vow to prevent Afghanistan from again being used as a base for planning terrorist attacks. That was enshrined in a 2020 peace deal with the Trump administration that paved the way for the drawdown of American troops, the last of whom are supposed to leave at the end of the month.When the Taliban were last in power they sheltered Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida group, which carried out the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. US officials fear al-Qaida and other groups could reconstitute themselves in Afghanistan now that the Taliban are back in power.Elsewhere in Afghanistan, the Taliban blew up a statue depicting Abdul Ali Mazari, a militia leader killed by the Taliban in 1996, when the Islamic militants seized power from rival warlords. Mazari was a champion of Afghanistan’s ethnic Hazara minority, Shiites who were persecuted under the Sunni Taliban’s earlier rule. That further raised concerns about whether they would make good on their promises, including not seeking revenge on those who have opposed them.In a sign of the difficulties any future Afghan government will face, the head of Afghanistan’s Central Bank said the country's supply of physical US dollars is “close to zero." Afghanistan has some $9 billion in reserves, Ajmal Ahmady tweeted, but most is held outside the country, with some $7 billion held in US Federal Reserve bonds, assets and gold.Ahmady said the country did not receive a planned cash shipment amid the Taliban offensive.“The next shipment never arrived,” he wrote. “Seems like our partners had good intelligence as to what was going to happen.”He said the lack of U dollars will likely lead to a depreciation of the local currency, the afghani, hurting the country's poor. Afghans have been lining up outside ATM machines for days, with many pulling out their life savings.Ahmady said the Taliban will struggle to access the country's reserves because of international sanctions.The “Taliban won militarily — but now have to govern,” he wrote. “It is not easy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-violently-disperse-rare-protest-in-jalalabad-killing-1-and-wounding-6-101629295457473.html

Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid had said earlier that the new government will be more “inclusive”.Sources close to the discussion told the Associated Press that “good news” regarding formation of the new government is expected within a day or two. The last round of talks mostly focused on how the Taliban-led government would deal with rights gained in the last 20 years while it was not in power.Taliban leaders like Muttaqi, who held the position of education minister during the regime’s earlier rule, reached out to Afghan political leaders even before President Ashraf Ghani left the country on August 15.

18-08-2021||World||Why vaccinated people largely escaped the worst of Delta surge? Study explains||The Delta variant of the coronavirus is believed to be highly transmissible and resistant to vaccines. But, a new study has claimed that the strain, which led the second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), is not able to evade the antibodies generated by vaccination.The study has been conducted by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in the United States and published in the journal Immunity.Delta was declared as the variant of concern by the World Health Organization (WHO).Why vaccinated people largely escaped the worst of Delta surge?The researchers analysed a panel of antibodies generated by people in response to Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine and found that Delta was unable to evade all but one of the antibodies they tested.Other variants of concern, such as Beta, avoided recognition and neutralisation by several of the antibodies, they said."The fact that Delta has outcompeted other variants does not mean that it's more resistant to our antibodies compared to other variants," said co-senior author Jacco Boon, an associate professor at Washington University.The researchThe health experts extracted antibody-producing cells from three people who had received the Pfizer vaccine.They grew the cells in the laboratory and obtained from them a set of 13 antibodies that target the original strain which began circulating last year.The researchers tested the antibodies against four variants of concern: Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta.Twelve of the 13 recognised Alpha and Delta, eight recognised all four variants, and one failed to recognise any of the four variants. Out of these, five antibodies neutralised the original strain."In face of vaccination, Delta is relatively a wimpy virus. If we had a variant that was more resistant like Beta but spread as easily as Delta, we would be in more trouble," Ellebedy said.The length and breadth of antibodiesIn previous studies, researchers have shown that both natural infection and vaccination elicit lasting antibody production.But this time, the group of scientists from Washington University noted that the length of the antibody response is only one aspect of protection, and breadth matters too.An ideal antibody response includes a diverse set of antibodies with the flexibility to recognise many slightly different variants of the virus, said the researchers.They added that breadth confers resilience, adding that even if a few antibodies lose the ability to recognise a new variant, other antibodies in the arsenal should remain capable of neutralising it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-vaccinated-people-largely-escaped-the-worst-of-delta-surge-study-explains-101629285593396.html
18-08-2021||World||Taliban to be judged on action, not words: UK PM Boris Johnson||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday said the new Taliban regime back in power in Afghanistan will be judged based on their actions and not words. The statement came a day after the Islamic militant outfit promised a peaceful rule following its complete takeover of the war-torn country on Sunday. The insurgents, known for their radical and regressive laws, also said they will respect their rights within the framework of Sharia law."We will judge this regime based on the choices it makes, and by its actions rather than by its words, on its attitude to terrorism, to crime and narcotics, as well as humanitarian access, and the rights of girls to receive an education," Johnson said in the British Parliament which resumed after a summer break to discuss the prevailing crisis in Afghanistan.Earlier in the day, Johnson spoke to his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan on the situation as part of a series of phone calls made with world leaders to push for a coordinated strategy to deal with an imminent humanitarian crisis. During the call, Johnson told Khan that any recognition of the new government in Afghanistan should happen on an "international, not unilateral" basis.The South-Asian nation has plunged into complete chaos after its Western-backed government collapsed following the withdrawal of US troops, two decades since it overthrew the repressive Taliban rule. With the Taliban seizing back power in the country and President Ashraf Ghani fleeing Afghanistan, world leaders are contemplating their stand on the Taliban regime as more and more images and stories of desperation emerge.On Monday, Russia said it will first observe the action of the new authorities closely, "only then it will make the decision", while the Chinese government has said it will form "friendly" relations with the Taliban regime.The head of the British Army also took a softer stance on the Taliban and said the world should give them the space to form a new government in Afghanistan and may discover that the insurgents cast as terrorists by the West for decades have become more reasonable. "We have to be patient, we have to hold our nerve and we have to give them the space to form a government and we have to give them the space to show their credentials," said Nick Carter in an interview with the BBC. "It may be that this Taliban is a different Taliban to the one that people remember from the 1990s," the chief of the defence staff added."But what we absolutely have to remember is that they are not a homogenous organisation - the Taliban is a group of disparate tribal figures that come from all over rural Afghanistan," Carter further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-to-be-judged-on-action-not-words-uk-pm-boris-johnson-101629284288063.html

The scheme includes providing refuge to 5,000 stranded Afghans in the first year alone, UK home secretary Priti Patel told BBC News. The development comes days after the Taliban's meteoric rise to power in Afghanistan.As the insurgents solidify control over the state apparatus, fear of conservative retribution has fueled a mass exodus of desperate and panicked residents who now flee the country apprehending the Taliban regime. According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), nearly 400,000 people were forced to leave their homes behind since the beginning of this year, joining 2.9 million Afghans already internally displaced across the country at the end of 2020."We owe a debt of gratitude to all those who have worked with us to make Afghanistan a better place over the last 20 years," said UK prime minister Boris Johnson. "Many of them, particularly women, are now in urgent need of our help."It is The Guardian that reports that women, children, and religious minorities will be prioritised in the Boris Johnson government's refugee resettlement scheme for stranded Afghans, adding that up to 20,000 people may resettle in the United Kingdom over a period of five years. However, citing a Whitehall source, the publication noted that most of these 20,000 people are likely to have fled to neighbouring countries such as Pakistan unless the UK can strike an agreement with the Taliban over the resettlement operations at the earliest.Ahead of launching the new resettlement scheme for Afghans, UK PM Boris Johnson had said that international partners need to come together to help prevent a humanitarian crisis.Notably, following the US withdrawal of troops in Afghanistan, the UK, too, had pulled its remaining troops out of the country. British soldiers are now working amid chaotic scenes in Kabul to help evacuate UK nationals and those Afghan citizens who worked for the British government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-announces-resettlement-plan-for-stranded-afghans-to-take-20-000-refugees-over-5-years-101629273082747.html

18-08-2021||World||How Afghanistan's president went from hero to villain-in-hiding||If anyone was supposed to know how to fix Afghanistan, it was Ashraf Ghani.Before becoming president in 2014, Ghani spent much of his life studying how to boost growth in poor nations. A Fulbright Scholar with a doctorate from Columbia University, he taught at some of America’s elite academic institutions before stints at the World Bank and United Nations. Later he co-wrote “Fixing Failed States: A Framework for Rebuilding a Fractured World.”Now Ghani’s whereabouts are a mystery after he fled Afghanistan on Sunday. Reports have spotted him everywhere from Tajikistan to Oman to Abu Dhabi, with the Russians claiming he left with four cars and a helicopter full of cash. In Afghanistan he’s become a villain: his central bank chief and key members of his administration have denounced him publicly. Efforts to reach him or his close aides were unsuccessful.In many ways, Ghani’s swift downfall reflects the broader failures of the U.S. to impose a government on Afghanistan that had buy-in from a range of competing power brokers with a long history of fighting on the battlefield rather than at the ballot box. Although he was a Pashtun, the country’s dominant ethnic group, Ghani was seen as an outsider who lacked the political touch to unite disparate factions, and he became more isolated over time. “Ghani was not accommodating of the realities of how Afghanistan works,” said Kabir Taneja, author of “The ISIS Peril: The World’s Most Feared Terror Group and its Shadow on South Asia” and a fellow at Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. “He either didn’t understand or couldn’t understand the warlords, who are essentially people representing ethnic fault lines.” After the U.S. invasion in 2001, Ghani returned to Afghanistan for the first time in more than a quarter-century, and served for two years as finance minister in an administration led by Hamid Karzai. Afterward Ghani became a darling of the international aid world, giving Ted Talks, penning op-eds in major newspapers and speaking at conferences. At one point he was considered a candidate for UN secretary-general. Following a failed bid for the presidency in 2009, Ghani linked up with several prominent Afghan politicians -- including influential warlord-turned-vice president Abdul Rashid Dostum -- to win the top job five years later. But his victory was undermined from the start: John Kerry, then America’s top diplomat, flew to Kabul to broker a unity government that gave his main rival the position of “chief executive” -- a title that appears nowhere in Afghanistan’s U.S.-modeled constitution. In 2017, Ghani said he had “the worst job on earth” in an interview with the BBC. Still, he claimed that Afghan security forces had turned a corner against the Taliban and coalition forces would be able to leave by 2021. That turned out to be accurate, just not in the way he predicted. President Donald Trump’s administration started direct talks with the Taliban in a bid to end America’s longest war, and shut Ghani out of the process. Then this year, after President Joe Biden set a withdrawal deadline for Aug. 31, Ghani resisted calls to step aside and allow a transitional government to take power as the Taliban made military advances. “Ghani pretended to be for peace, but in reality he was in favor of war in order to remain in power even if it cost lives and pushed the Taliban to revert back to a military option,” said Omar Samad, former Afghan ambassador to Europe and fellow at Atlantic Council. “The delay tactics ruined the chances for a deal that would have removed him from office but would have paved the way for a broad-based transition.”‘I Will Not Flee!’As the Taliban descended on Kabul over the weekend, Ghani told the people that he would avoid the fate of former king Amanullah Khan, who abdicated and fled to British India in 1929. “I will not flee!” Ghani said at an event in Kabul on Aug. 4, raising his voice loudly. “I won’t seek safe haven and I will be at the service of people.”Yet as the Taliban blitzed across the country and marched to Kabul, Ghani appeared increasingly isolated. In a video released hours before he fled, Ghani called for the defense ministry to set up telephone helplines for citizens to call. ‘Treason’After leaving, Ghani released a Facebook post saying he exited the country to avoid bloodshed -- a move that infuriated his cabinet. “They tied out hands behind our backs and sold off the country,” Bismillah Mohammadi, Afghanistan’s acting defense minister, said on Twitter after Ghani fled. “Damn to Ghani and his team.”With Ghani nowhere to be found, former president Karzai and other Afghan politicians are now leading talks with the Taliban in Doha on setting up a new government.

Too much of 'general amnesty," tweeted Saleem Javed, a human rights activist.Mazari was a Hazara leader who was executed by the Taliban in 1995. Taliban over the years has been repeatedly attacking Hazaras.The Hazaras are an ethnic group that is mainly concentrated in the mountainous central region of Afghanistan known as Hazarajat.So Taliban have blown up slain #Hazara leader Abdul Ali Mazari’s statue in Bamiyan.

Reports said German Chancellor Angela Merkel and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have called up Imran Khan to discuss the situation in Afghanistan.Imran Khan has always opposed the presence of the US military in his neighbourhood and championed a compromise between Afghan authorities and the Taliban. On allegations of providing a safe haven to the Taliban in his country, he earlier said that the Taliban are not a military outfit that can be hunted down by the Pakistani army.The Taliban's unopposed accession to power in Afghanistan has paved way for a no-compromise government as reports said that the Taliban now want full control of the country. As the world is closely following the developments taking place in both Kabul and Doha. Canada has already said that it will not recognise the Taliban as the Afghan government. Boris Johnson on Sunday said nobody should bilaterally recognise the Taliban as the government of Afghanistan.Imran Khan has termed the Taliban takeover as "breaking the chains of slavery". "You take over the other culture and become psychologically subservient. When that happens, please remember, it is worse than actual slavery. It is harder to throw off the chains of cultural enslavement. What is happening in Afghanistan now, they have broken the shackles of slavery," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stay-engaged-to-support-afghans-imran-khan-s-message-to-global-leaders-101629268709066.html

The country is now under the siege of the Taliban, which is likely to impose radical Islamic law and experts fear that they will turn the country into the safe haven of terrorist activities.In the backdrop of this embroiling crisis, a statement made by Biden is making headlines in which he seems to be in favour of the withdrawal of US troops from the war-torn country. According to a report by the Atlantic, Richard Holbrooke who was a special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan in the Obama administration in 2010, asked Biden whether the US has a moral obligation to remain in Afghanistan to protect its residents. To this, the then vice-president responded, saying "F--- that, we don’t have to worry about that. We did it in Vietnam, Nixon and Kissinger got away with it. The news outlet cited Holbrooke's diary as the source of the statement.During the Vietnam war, the US sent its troops to defend South Vietnam in 1955. For the next nearly 20 years, the forces stayed there and fought with the North Vietnam forces. The war eventually ended after the US troops were forced to leave South Vietnam following the capture of Saigon, now known as Ho Chi Minh City, by North Vietnam’s forces.After this, the US forces carried out evacuations, similar to the ones it is now carrying out in Afghanistan following the Taliban military takeover of the capital city Kabul.The US entered Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks for "war on terror" and ousted the Taliban from the country. Since then the US troops have stayed in the South Asian nation to help in anti-terror operations.Taliban returned to rule this week after a lightning offensive as US-led Western forces withdrew under a deal that included a promise by the insurgent group not to attack them as they leave.The plan to withdraw from Afghanistan was announced by former US President Donald Trump. After taking over the office this year, President Joe Biden continued with the plan and announced that the last troops would leave by the end of August.On Tuesday, rejecting the criticism over the fallout, Biden said he stands behind the decision to leave the country. He also assured to evacuate thousands of Afghans from the country, while also pinned the blame for the fallout on the Afghanistan government. In his address from the White House, Biden said that he had warned Ashraf Ghani — who was appointed Afghanistan's president in a US-negotiated agreement — to be prepared to fight a civil war with the Taliban after American forces leave the country. "They failed to do any of that," Biden also said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/under-fire-over-withdrawal-of-us-troops-from-afghanistan-biden-s-2010-statement-surfaces-101629269120145.html
18-08-2021||World||Taliban attack women, children at Kabul airport despite peace promise: Report||The Taliban, since taking over the power in Afghanistan, have promised peace and said they would respect the rights of women, but the reality on the ground is something else.Photos and videos emerging from Kabul show that Taliban fighters are using sharp objects to beat back women and children who are desperately trying to enter Kabul airport in a bid to leave the country.The insurgents also opened fire to drive the crowds back from the airport, the videos showed. Los Angeles Times reporter Marcus Yam posted some of the pictures on Twitter on Wednesday and claimed in accompanying text that at least half dozen were wounded, including a woman and her child.*GRAPHIC WARNING* Taliban fighters use gunfire, whips, sticks and sharp objects to maintain crowd control over thousands of Afghans who continue to wait for a way out, on airport road. At least half dozen were wounded while I was there, including a woman and her child. #Kabul pic.twitter.com/a2KzNPx07RFox News obtained a video, which it claims shows Taliban fighters roaming around the streets of Kabul and other places and opening fire while looking for ex-government workers. The channel also reported about an incident in Takhar province where a woman was killed by Taliban fighters on Tuesday for being in public without a head covering.CNN carried a report which had chilling details about thrashing of a woman in Faryab province in July. The fighters knocked on the door of Najia, in a remote village, and asked her to cook food for 15 fighters, the CNN report said. When she told the Taliban fighters that she is poor and won't be able to cook food, they started beating her with their AK-47 rifles, threw a grenade in the next room and fled as the flames spread. The report was based on the account given by Najia's daughter Manizha.Last week, the United Nations claimed that more than 1,000 civilians had been killed by the Taliban and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said that since August 1, some 4,042 wounded people had been treated at 15 health facilities.Though the Taliban have denied targeting and killing civilians during their offensive against Afghan government troops, the United States government has refuted the claims.The Taliban, fighting since their 2001 ouster to expel foreign forces, seized Kabul on Sunday after a lightning offensive as US-led Western withdrew under a deal that included a promise from the insurgents not to attack them as they leave.In their first news briefing since capturing Kabul, the Taliban suggested they would impose their laws more softly than during their earlier time in power, between 1996-2001."We don't want any internal or external enemies," Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban's main spokesman, told reporters.Women would be allowed to work and study and "will be very active in society but within the framework of Islam", he said.But many women have expressed skepticism. "They have to walk the talk. Right now they are not doing that," Pashtana Durrani, 23, an Afghan girls' education activist, told news agency Reuters.Local media reports have said that several women were ordered to leave their jobs during the Taliban's rapid advance across Afghanistan.During their previous rule, also guided by sharia religious law, the Taliban had stopped women from working. Girls were not allowed to go to school and women had to wear all-enveloping burqas to go out and then only when accompanied by a male relative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-attack-women-children-at-kabul-airport-despite-peace-promise-report-101629267994723.html

Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole was also categorical on this point, as he tweeted, “I was asked by a caller if I would recognise the legitimacy of the Taliban in Afghanistan. Let me be clear: never.” The New Democratic Party has taken the same stand.Trudeau also pointed out that the Taliban “are a recognised terrorist organisation under Canadian law” and had “taken over and replaced the duly elected, democratic government by force.”But as campaigning for the Federal elections on September 20 continues, fears have been expressed that it will adversely impact Canada’s response to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan after the Trudeau government’s initial tardy reaction led to a delayed announcement that 20,000 Afghans will be taken in as part of special immigration programme.Among the critics is Ottawa-based Dr Nipa Banerjee, who headed Canada’s aid programme in Afghanistan between 2003 and 2006. Responsible ministers, she said, will be busy with safeguarding their political futures rather than focusing fully on the matter, though that needs to be addressed urgently. “The election will have an impact on what we can do in Afghanistan,” Banerjee, who regularly returned to Afghanistan twice a year till recently said Canada’s response has been “chaotic and not organised”. “People who worked on our development programmes, they have not even been considered. I know a lot of people who are there and they are saying they wanted to get out. But the Canadian government has done nothing. They are as much as exposed as military people. It’s obvious to me, these people are not even considered.”Banerjee, currently a senior fellow at the University of Ottawa’s School of International Development and Global Studies, said she heard regularly from these former associates, who are panic-stricken. She said she heard from them that many filled an online form for the special immigration programme, but have “not received any answer”.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-not-to-recognise-taliban-led-afghan-govt-trudeau-101629262417820.html

The risk of new fires has also been increased as the state is bracing for an early-season wind storm that could send flames burning out of control.According to the forecast of the National Weather Service of the country, the wind speed is likely to become 35mph as it issued red flag warnings for several states in the western region.On Tuesday, the Caldore fire which erupted over the weekend spread through the small rural town of Grizzly flats as it tripled in size between Monday and Tuesday afternoon to nearly 50 square miles (129 square kilometres). The fast-moving Caldore fire has injured at least two people and burned around 50 homes in and around Grizzly Flats so far, according to the news agency AP report.To the north, the Dixie Fire — the largest of some 100 active wildfires in more than a dozen Western states — was advancing toward Susanville, population about 18,000.Wildfires are common in California, but over the last few years, California is seeing more and more wildfires and the intensity of these flames is just increasing every year.Why?There are four key reasons that that state suffers from the most destructive fires in the country. The first is California is already a dry state. The land in California gets most of its moisture in the fall season which is dried out by the spring vegetation. Hence, the state experience the never-ending dry season, which essentially fuels the wildfires.The second is climate change, which has made the west part of the US warmer and drier in the past 30 years and, according to experts, this will continue to make the weather more extreme and wildfires more destructive.Another factor is California's large population. Many people are not moving towards the forested areas of the state, where a spark caused by campfires, parties becomes out of control.Lastly, California is vulnerable to fires due to Santa Ana winds that dry out the vegetation and fuel embers snowball into larger blazes.According to a report by the New York Times, fires caused by Santa Ana winds spread three times faster and burn closer to urban areas. They were responsible for 80% of the economic losses over two decades beginning in 1990, according to the report.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-change-dry-weather-why-california-burns-every-year-101629261688906.html
18-08-2021||World||Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar returns to Afghanistan after 20 years. Who is he?||Abdul Ghani Baradar, the co-founder of the Taliban, and now the undisputed victor of the Afghanistan war, is back in the country after 20 years. In 2001, he was ousted from Afghanistan and the Taliban leadership on Tuesday claimed that he has arrived at Kandahar from Qatar. Abdul Ghani Baradar, as the most public face of the Taliban, is likely to become the new President, reports said. Though Haibatullah Akhundzada is the overall leader of the outfit, Abdul Ghani Baradar has remained the face of the Taliban and his return to the country with the fall of Kabul indicates mobilisation to form the new government.Also Read: As Taliban take control of Afghanistan, a look at who's who of the leadershipHere are 10 things you need to know about Abdul Ghani Baradar1. He was born in 1968, in Uruzgan province of Afghanistan. He fought in the Afghan Mujahideen against the Soviets in the 1980s.2. In 1989, after the Soviets left and the country was torn in civil war, Baradar set up a madrassa in Kandahar with Mohammad Omar. The duo then launched the Taliban movement in 1994 and came to power in 1996. The two men reportedly became brothers-in-law after Baradar married Mullah Omar's sister.3. He became the deputy minister of defence during the last regime of the Taliban and then following US intervention, he was banished. Pakistan, Saudia Arabia and the UAE had only recognised the Taliban rule.4. Baradar was arrested by Pakistani authorities from Karachi in 2010 and was in Pakistan custody.5. In 2018, at the request of the United States, Baradar was released from Pakistan and was relocated to Doha.6. In February 2020, Baradar signed the Doha agreement with the United States.7. Then US President Donald Trump had spoken to Baradar on the Afghanistan peace process.8. Baradar led the nine-member Taliban delegation that was hosted by China in July 2021. China termed the Afghan Taliban as an important military and political force in the country.9. Reports said Baradar had understood from the five-year regime that the Taliban had to increase popular support and that's why he, in 2009, ordered Taliban foot soldiers to carry a small handbook on how to win the hearts and minds of villagers. This "code of conduct" focussed on reducing civilian casualties.10. After Sunday's bloodless coup, Baradar issued a message for Taliban fighters and said that the challenge just began as the Taliban would have to govern the country. Some reports said he was present in Kabul, negotiation with Ashraf Ghani, but Taliban spokespersons said he was in Qatar at that time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mullah-abdul-ghani-baradar-returns-to-afghanistan-after-20-years-who-is-he-101629261443178.html
18-08-2021||World||Experts remain sceptical as Taliban promise to 'protect' women, children rights||Afghanistan was thrown into disarray this week as the Taliban seized control of power in aftermath of the troops' pullout by the United States and NATO. The group declared victory over the government as the group entered the already abandoned presidential palace on Sunday after President Ashraf Ghani fled the country with his key staff.The military takeover has triggered a massive panic across Afghans leading to a mass exodus from the country. Residents fear that the insurgents will reimpose their radical and brutal policies that prevailed from 1996 to 2001.Also Read | Moderate Taliban is an oxymoronDuring their rule, imposed Sharia Islamic law under which the group executed people publicly for crimes as small as theft. The women were required to be covered all the time in the traditional burqa. The group also restricted women to study. While men were forced to grow beards. The group was eventually thrown out of power after US forces entered the country for anti-terrorist operations following the 9/11 attack.However, the Taliban this time have promised to rule differently and more moderately. On Tuesday, in a first press conference since the military takeover of the capital, the group pledged to protect the rights of women and minorities. Responding to a question by a journalist on what will be different this time that their previous rule, the Taliban spokesperson said the group has a different perspective now. "The ideology and beliefs are the same because they're Muslims, but there is a change in terms of experience--they're more experienced and have a different perspective," the spokesperson said at the media interactions.Experts are still sceptical of the situation that will follow after the group reaches a settlement through which the group plans to establish an Islamic government in the country"The Taliban has never renounced violence, it has not moderated its draconian views on justice and women, and it is allied with international terrorists," news agency ANI quoted US scholar Michael Kugelman as saying. Mohammed Soliman, Scholar at the Middle East Institute in Washington, also believes that the social and civil rights "arena is foggier".Also Read | Old video of Taliban fighters laughing about women politicians goes viralThere are also signs from the ground that paints a different picture than what the Taliban promises. Multiple reports have emerged since the Taliban offensive claiming that the group killed women for not covering their heads. On August 1, a 21-year-old woman was reportedly shot dead by the Taliban for not wearing a veil. Reports suggested that the woman was on her way to Balkh district centre when she was dragged out of a car and killed by the Taliban.According to a report by Al-Jazeera, the group also sent several women working banks home and told them that their male relatives can takeover their work.On Monday, United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres expressed concerns regarding the human rights violations and said he has been "receiving chilling reports of severe restrictions on human rights" throughout the country. "I am particularly concerned by accounts of mounting human rights violations against the women and girls of Afghanistan," he said at an emergency meeting of the Security Council.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/experts-remain-sceptical-as-taliban-promise-to-protect-women-children-rights-101629261110284.html
18-08-2021||World||Moderate Taliban is an oxymoron||Delivering a lecture a month after 9/11 attacks, Jaswant Singh, then external affairs minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee's cabinet, described a moderate Taliban an oxymoron. Two decades later, after US and allied forces literally ran away from Afghanistan leaving Kabul to the mercy of ultra conservative UN designated terrorist group, the debate has again started on moderate Taliban after its spokesperson promised to fully implement more than a 1000-year-old Islamic Sharia code under the new Emirates of Afghanistan. The assurances of the Taliban spokesperson are hardly of any value to Afghanistan watchers as the Sunni Pashtun group was planning a pincer attack on Kabul while talking about a so-called negotiated settlement in Doha, Qatar. Fact is that the Taliban, under the smokescreen of talks, was allowed to make a fool out of Americans (all thanks to Zalmay Khalilzad) and the Sunni group is in no mood to share spoils of its victory with anyone.When the Taliban last captured Kabul in 1996, there was a power vacuum in Afghanistan with the Soviets running away with their tails firmly tucked between their legs and the West led by the US in retreat mode as their objective had been achieved. The situation on August 15, 2021 was no different. Only this time the US ran away from Kabul and so did its appointee Ashraf Ghani and anti-US forces like China, Russia, Iran and Turkey are all breathing a sigh of relief as America is no longer patrolling their backyard. However, what has changed is that the Taliban, after showing tremendous resilience and motivation for two decades, have come out much stronger this time with even north Afghanistan under its control and powers like China and Russia unilaterally offering to smoke the peace pipe. Of course, the principal role of Pakistani deep state and Taliban Deobandi ideological brothers like Jaish-e-Mohammad and Tehreek-e-Taliban cannot be forgotten in nourishing the Sunni terrorist group. All the talk of the Afghan led-Afghan owned peace process has been consigned to the pathetic dustbin of history.With a force of over 75,000 hardline cadre and top of the line US weapons surrendered by pusillanimous 300,000 Afghan Army personnel, the Taliban are really not looking for recognition from the democratic world as they now have territory to rule and enforce the Islamic law. Last time, mother Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and UAE recognised the Taliban, this time the number led by China, Russia, Iran and Turkey will be much higher.Under the circumstances, India is in no hurry to take a position on Taliban even if the US is looking for an excuse of a negotiated settlement to recognise the radicalised Sunni force. After all, the US invaded Afghanistan to get rid of Al-Qaeda led by Osama bin Laden not the Taliban. And withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan was first proposed by Democrat President Barack Obama in his 2011 way forward speech with the support of his then Vice President Joe Biden.For “India First” Narendra Modi government, the parameters of engaging the Taliban are based on its relationship with Pakistan and Pakistan-based Deobandi terrorist groups with India in their cross-hairs. There is also a serious incoming internal security threat to India as the victorious Taliban will be the galvanizing force for the Ummah, leading to increased global radicalisation as witnessed when the so-called Islamic State captured Mosul in 2014. Today, the Taliban have become the beacon of political Islam and will attract followers from all over the world.While for the time-being it is a win-win situation for the Taliban, this may not be so in the coming months after reality of the Sunni Pashtun group dawns on the minorities. One must remember that 40 per cent of the Afghan army was of Tajik ethnicity and they may take to weapons under the leadership of young Ahmed Massoud and Amrullah Saleh, provided the two survive the Taliban onslaught on Panjshir Valley. Historically, the military situation in Afghanistan is known to change at the drop of a dime or dollar.While the Taliban have traditionally maintained that they have no interest in Kashmir issue and has always rejected the Durand Line, India is waiting on whether the Sunni Islamist force, which draws inspiration from Wahhabism as Deoband does, cuts a deal with TTP in favour of Pakistan Army. TTP leader Mufti Noor Wali Mehsud has already made it clear that it will continue to fight Pakistan Army while thanking Haibatullah Akundzada for releasing their deputy leader Maulvi Faqir Mohammed from Bagram highest security prison. No less than 7,000 hardcore and most brutal terrorists were let go by the Taliban from Bagram prison and the US will have to answer for future terror attacks. It will become clear to India on Pakistan’s leverage on the Afghan Taliban if they try to get their Pakistan namesake on the peace table for Rawalpindi GHQ.The other issue being watched by Indian counter-terrorism experts is the relationship between the Taliban and Bhawalpur based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) group, which has vowed to target India on Kashmir. One must remember that Jaish Emir Maulana Masood Azhar was taken directly to Emir-ul-Momeen Mullah Omar after he was freed by India in the 1999 IC-814 hijacking at Kandahar. The Taliban have no love lost for Ahle-Hadith Lashkar-e-Tayebba group and are now low on priority of the Pakistani ISI.If Taliban have no overt interest in Kashmir, then they will not supply top of the line US made weapons, drones and military vehicles or provide terror training camps to Azhar gang in Afghanistan for targeting India. If India is targeted under the umbrella of Taliban despite their public and private assurances, then the next Balakot will be in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderate-taliban-is-an-oxymoron-101629259821847.html

With the evacuation operations at the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul accelerating, several US lawmakers across the political spectrum are now imploring the president to keep US forces in Afghanistan until the time they finish evacuating every single US citizen and Afghan allies fleeing the Taliban. More than 40 lawmakers from the US House of Representatives issued a letter to President Biden on Tuesday, in which they requested him to extend the August 31 deadline that was earlier imposed for the military mission.Also Read | Implications of US move for the world“The United States must do everything possible to securely hold the airport in Kabul until the rescue mission is complete and our citizens, allies, and vulnerable Afghans have had an opportunity to leave,” the letter read. "We trust that the previous August 31st deadline you imposed on our military mission will not apply to this effort and that we will stay as long as is necessary to complete it."The letter was commissioned under the leadership of Democratic Representatives Tom Malinowski of New Jersey and Jason Crow of Colorado but also includes long-time war critics alongside GOP hawks, along with many lawmakers who have served in Afghanistan. According to the Bloomberg news agency, the bipartisan push from the US lawmakers on the Afghanistan issue "underscores the growing unease on Capitol Hill about the United States’ messy withdrawal amid the Taliban’s rapid rise in the country."Also Read | Moderate Taliban is an oxymoronOthers who signed the letter include Democrats who have long agitated to end the Afghan conflict, including Barbara Lee of California, the only lawmaker to vote against the war authorization in 2001, Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, and Pramila Jayapal of Washington. They are joined by Elise Stefanik of New York, the third-ranking House Republican, and Dan Crenshaw of Texas among other GOP House members.Although Pentagon officials have not confirmed that the military drawdown deadline will be extended, they said on Wednesday that troops would hold the Kabul airport until the end of the month to evacuate as many as possible. In case the deadline is extended, the order must come straight from President Joe Biden.“The mission runs through August 31st,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters. “The commander in chief made it very clear that we were to complete this drawdown by August 31st.” He added that the Pentagon is aiming to fly planes out every hour with the goal of airlifting between 5,000 and 9,000 people a day.There are still 11,000 “self-identified” US citizens in Afghanistan, according to White House press secretary Jen Psaki.

Women employees of two banks in Kandahar and Herat have been relieved of their duties so that male members can replace them, reports said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/old-video-of-taliban-fighters-laughing-about-women-politicians-goes-viral-101629252536284.html

Citing local media reports, the PTI news agency reported that the Pakistani TikToker lodged an FIR in this regard, where she complained that people tore her clothes during the chaos and kept throwing her into the air while she and her companions attempted to escape the mob. She also alleged that her ring and earrings were "forcibly taken" by unidentified people in the crowd, while the mobile phone and identity card of one of her companions, along with a sum of about 15,000 PKR, were also "snatched".A video of the incident has gone viral on social media, with netizens seeking to identify the men spotted in the video and calling for legal action to be initiated against them. On its part though, the Lahore police have registered a case against hundreds of unidentified persons for assaulting and stealing from the TikToker woman.The incident took place at the Greater Iqbal Park area in Lahore on Independence Day, according to the First Information Report (FIR) registered at the Lorry Adda police station in the city. As per the complaint, the TikToker and six of her companions were filming a video near Minar-e-Pakistan on August 14, marked as Independence Day in the country, when around 300 to 400 people "attacked" them."The crowd was huge and people were scaling the enclosure and coming towards us," the woman wrote in her complaint at the police station. "People were pushing and pulling me to the extent that they tore my clothes." She added that although several people were trying to help her escape the mob, the crowd was "too huge" and they kept throwing her into the air."The unidentified persons assaulted us violently," the complainant added in her complaint.Meanwhile, Lahore DIG (Operations) Sajid Kiywani has ordered the superintendent of police (SP) to take "immediate legal action" against the suspects involved in the incident, according to a report by the Dawn newspaper. The TikTok application, which is much popular in Pakistan with over 39 million downloads, has been banned and restored multiple times in the country over accusations that the platform spreads 'immorality' and 'obscenity'.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clothes-torn-hurled-into-air-pakistani-tiktoker-says-she-was-attacked-by-mob-on-iday-101629250730440.html

As the insurgents, now in control of the country, solidify their rule, a gut-wrenching visual reportedly emerging from the Kabul airport on August 17 has rattled global humanitarian watchdogs. The photograph, which was posted by the Aśvaka news agency on Twitter, shows an infant who was reportedly separated from parents during the chaos at Kabul airport. The child, who according to the agency is no older than seven months, is now waiting to be united with parents with the help of authorities issuing missing announcements on social media."A couple living in PD-5 Kabul blame that their 7 months' baby went missing from Kabul Airport yesterday during the chaos," the news agency posted from its official handle on Twitter. "Up to this instance, they couldn't find him. The Aśvaka news agency is trying to help them find their baby through missing announcements on social media."A couple living in PD-5 #Kabul blame that their 7 Months Baby went missing from Kabul Airport yesterday during the chaos.

While netizens expressed their anguish at the Taliban for the fate of the seven-month-old infant along with many others who saw their lives come down to ruin with the Taliban offensive, several Twitter users also came out with scathing remarks against international agencies as well as the United States for allowing such a situation to unfold.Several horrific visuals have emerged from Afghanistan's capital Kabul since the Taliban took control. While a video showed hundreds surrounding a taxiing aircraft at the Hamid Karzai International Airport, another showed the true desperation, sadness, and panic of citizens as they tried to board the last flights leaving Kabul before the airport was shut.Perhaps the most haunting visual to emerge from the Kabul chaos was of two persons, who were clinging to an aircraft in desperation to flee the country, falling from the sky after losing grip mid-air.Meanwhile, more than 2,200 students of Afghan-origin studying in India on scholarship stare at an uncertain future with the Taliban seizing control of Afghanistan that has forced thousands to either flee or seek evacuation from the country. The Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR), a nodal agency for international students that promotes cultural exchange with other countries by formulating and implementing policies and programmes, has also been receiving requests from students in Afghanistan for expediting their visas to permit entry into India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sevenmonthold-infant-separated-from-parents-during-chaos-at-kabul-airport-photo-goes-viral-101629245920892.html
18-08-2021||World||Death toll from Haiti's weekend earthquake rises to 1,941||Haitian officials raised the death toll from a deadly weekend earthquake by more than 500 on Tuesday after Tropical Storm Grace forced a temporary halt to search and rescue efforts, a delay that fed growing anger and frustration among thousands who were left homeless.Grace battered southwestern Haiti, which was hit hardest by Saturday's quake, and officials warned some areas could get 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain before the storm moved on. Intermittent rain fell in the earthquake-damaged city of Les Cayes and in the capital of Port-au-Prince.Late Tuesday afternoon, the Civil Protection Agency raised the death toll to 1,941 and the number of injured to 9,900, many of whom have had to wait for medical help lying outside in wilting heat.The devastation is centered in the country’s southwestern area, where health care has reached capacity and people have lost homes and loved ones.Patience was running out in the Western Hemisphere’s poorest nation. Haitians already were struggling with the coronavirus, gang violence, worsening poverty and the July 7 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse when the quake hit.Bodies continued to be pulled from the rubble, and the smell of death hung heavily over a pancaked, three-story apartment building. A simple bed sheet covered the body of a 3-year-old girl that firefighters had found an hour earlier.Neighbor Joseph Boyer, 53, said he knew the girl's family.“The mother and father are in the hospital, but all three kids died,” he said. The bodies of the other two siblings were found earlier.Illustrating the lack of government presence, volunteer firefighters from the nearby city of Cap-Hatien had left the body out in the rain because police have to be present before a body can be taken away.Another neighbor, James Luxama, 24, repeated a popular rumor at many disaster scenes, saying that someone was sending text messages for help from inside the rubble. But Luxama had not personally seen or received such a message.A throng of angry, shouting men gathered in front of the collapsed building, a sign that patience was running out for people who have waited days for help from the government.“The photographers come through, the press, but we have no tarps for our roofs,” said one man, who refused to give his name.The head of Haiti’s office of civil protection, Jerry Chandler, acknowledged the situation. Earthquake assessments had to be paused because of the heavy rain, “and people are getting aggressive,” Chandler said Tuesday.Some children were orphaned in the quake and some youngsters were starting to go hungry, said Carl-Henry Petit-Frère, a field manager for Save the Children, which said in a statement that it was distributing what it could to people living on the streets without protection from the wind and rain.“I see children crying on the street, people asking us for food, but we are low on food ourselves as well," Petit-Frère said, adding that children were warned not to go into houses because they could collapse. “The organizations that are here are doing what they can, but we need more supplies. Food, clean water and shelter are needed most, and we need them fast.”About 20 soldiers finally showed up to help rescuers at the collapsed apartment building.Prior to that, the only help that arrived was from poorly equipped volunteers.“All we have are sledgehammers and hands. That’s the plan,” said Canadian volunteer Randy Lodder, director of the Adoration Christian School in Haiti.Sarah Charles, assistant administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, said its disaster response teams were forced to suspend operations as the storm arrived Monday, but members were back Tuesday to assess its impact and continue helping.“We do not anticipate that the death toll related to this earthquake will be anywhere near the 2010 earthquake, where more than 200,000 people were killed,” Charles told reporters.The scale of the damage also was not as severe as that earthquake, she said, adding: “That’s not what we’re seeing on the ground right now.”In a statement, the U.S. military's Southern Command said it was moving eight helicopters from Honduras to Haiti and that seven U.S. Coast Guard cutters were en route to support the USAID team. Two cutters already are there along with two Coast Guard helicopters and U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon aircraft that are taking aerial images of earthquake devastated areas, the statement said.The effort was being mounted “to provide the kind of emergency response that is necessary in a human tragedy and catastrophe like this,” U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House.John Morrison, public information officer for the Fairfax Co. (Virginia) Urban Search and Rescue, said its team was still trying to find survivors. Two U.S. Coast Guard helicopters had ferried searchers to six stricken communities on Monday.“The team reports that food, health care services, safe drinking water, hygiene and sanitation and shelter are all priority needs,” Morrison said. He added that the team had not seen any signs of people trapped alive in buildings.The rain and wind raised the threat of mudslides and flash flooding as Grace slowly passed over southwestern Haiti's Tiburon Peninsula before heading toward Jamaica and southeastern Cuba. Forecasters said it could become a hurricane before hitting Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.Officials said the magnitude 7.2 earthquake destroyed more than 7,000 homes and damaged nearly 5,000, leaving about 30,000 families homeless. Hospitals, schools, offices and churches also were demolished or badly damaged.In the village of Bonne Fin, a one-hour drive from from Les Cayes on dirt roads, the mountaintop Hospital Lumiere illustrated the anguish and complexity of Haiti’s medical crisis and dire need for outside help.No one died or was injured at the hospital when the quake hit, but the operating rooms partially collapsed.Through cracks in a wall, Dr. Frantz Codio could see three glistening anesthesia machines he needed to perform orthopedic operations on broken bones. But he could not get to them because the building's cement floor was leaning at a crazy angle — in some places just 3 or 4 feet (0.9 meters to 1.2 meters) above where it used to be.Despite warnings not to go inside the structure, Codio did so on Sunday and pulled one of the machines out.“People said, ‘Don’t go in there, it’s too dangerous,’ but I had God with me,” Codio said.Etzer Emile, a Haitian economist and professor at Quisqueya University, a private institution in Port-au-Prince, said the earthquake will almost certainly result in more long-term poverty for Haiti’s struggling southwestern region.Political instability and gang criminality along the southern roads into the region have particularly hobbled economic activity in recent years.“The earthquake has just given a fatal blow to a regional economy already on its knees for about 2 1/2 years,” Emile said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-from-haiti-s-weekend-earthquake-rises-to-1941-101629245761353.html

The message sent through the address is that Taliban 2.0 is dovish and conciliatory. Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid addressed the conference and reiterated that there will be no execution and punishment -- hallmarks of the Taliban's previous time in power two decades ago.Here's what the Taliban said:No revenge: Taliban would not seek retribution against former soldiers and government officials, and would grant an amnesty for former soldiers as well as contractors and translators who worked for international forces. "All those in the opposite side are pardoned from A to Z. We will not seek revenge," the spokesperson said.Taliban 1.0 and Taliban 2.0: If the question is based on ideology, and beliefs, there is no difference between Taliban during 1996 and 2001, but if calculated on experience, maturity, and insight, no doubt there are many differences.Women rights: Women would be allowed to work and study and "will be very active in society but within the framework of Islam.International relations: Taliban don't want to repeat any conflict, any war again, and they want to do away with the factors for conflict. "Taliban would not allow Afghanistan to be used as a base for attacking other countries, as it was in the years before 9/11," the spokesperson said.Press freedom: "We will respect freedom of the press because media reporting will be useful to society and will be able to help correct the leaders' errors. Journalists working for state or privately-owned media are not criminals and none of them will be prosecuted. In our view, these journalists are civilians and moreover, are talented young people who constitute our richness," the spokesperson said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/womens-rights-under-islamic-law-to-amnesty-what-taliban-said-in-1st-address-101629245433146.html

But certainly, a fair amount of it has fallen into the hands of the Taliban," said White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan."Obviously, we don't have a sense that they are going to readily hand it over to us," he said.Sullivan said losing control of millions of dollars worth of military supplies to an enemy is an example of "the difficult choices a president faces ... in the context of the end of a 20-year war."He noted that the Black Hawks had been supplied to Afghan government forces to help battle the Taliban insurgency.But the government forces succumbed to the Islamist insurgents quickly, and gave up control of large stores of weaponry and their helicopters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-gained-fair-amount-of-us-defense-equipment-white-house-101629244966216.html

Not only do we want to lead by example, we cannot do this alone," she wrote.As the situation rapidly changed over the last few days, it has been difficult to evacuate people stuck in other parts of Afghanistan where there is no access to an airport or a third country."The complex picture on the ground means there will be significant challenges delivering the scheme, but the government is working at speed to address these obstacles," the Home Office said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-plans-to-welcome-thousands-of-afghans-in-new-refugee-plan-101629243701901.html
18-08-2021||India||CPI minister seeks refugee status for all Afghans seeking relocation to India||A Communist Party of India parliamentarian urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to grant refugee to Afghans who would seek asylum to India, irrespective of their religion, in the wake of the evolving situation after the Taliban laid siege to the country."In light of India's international position and role in South Asia, it is imperative that we allow refugees regardless of their religion. I request the Centre to extend refugee status to all Afghan citizens who wish to relocate to India because of the resurgence of the Taliban," Rajya Sabha MP Binoy Viswam wrote in his letter to Modi, as he called the situation in Afghanistan a “humanitarian and security crisis”, according to news agency PTI.Viswam called upon the government to ensure the safe return of all Indian citizens stranded in Afghanistan. “Given the volatility of the situation, we must closely assess the on-ground conditions and escort these individuals out of Afghanistan as soon as there is a window of opportunity,” he wrote.The spokesperson for the Union ministry of external affairs, Arindam Bagchi, had on Monday said India would facilitate the repatriation of Sikhs and Hindus who wished to leave Afghanistan.India also activated a unit to coordinate repatriation and related matters in Afghanistan over reports of several and Hindu families taking refuge inside a gurdwara in Kabul.The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, the top gurdwara body, on Saturday urged the Centre to ensure the safety of Sikhs living in Afghanistan and make arrangements to bring back those who want to come to India.The CPI parliamentarian urged the Centre to grant visa extension to Afghan citizens residing in India at the moment."I would particularly like to stress this point for all Afghan students currently studying in various Indian institutions. These students are in a vulnerable and helpless situation, and we must offer a safe haven to them," Viswam wrote.The ministry of external affairs announced to introduce a special ‘e-Emergency X-Misc Visa' for Afghans for six months, initially. However, the new category of the visa covers Afghan citizens, irrespective of their religion, who want to visit India temporarily to escape the volatile situation there.The Centre said the special online visa had nothing to do with the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) which seeks to fast-track Indian citizenship for persecuted religious minority communities in the Muslim-majority nations of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who arrived in India before December 31, 2014.The Indian government is mulling to grant refuge to Afghan citizens, especially those facing threats or fearing persecution from the Taliban, against the backdrop of the rapid deterioration of the security situation in Afghanistan."Civilian life is of utmost importance and the Indian government must do everything in its capacity to protect the innocent who are victims in this conflict. On grounds of humanity and secularity, I humbly request the Indian government to consider a responsible and inclusive strategy to extend support to the innocent citizens of Afghanistan," he further wrote.India on Tuesday is brought back home its ambassador, Rudendra Tandon, and staff at the embassy in Kabul in a C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft of the Indian Air Force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghanistan-taliban-regime-afghan-refugees-india-asylum-afghanistan-crisis-101629310302480.html
18-08-2021||India||ITBP’s canine soldiers among personnel evacuated from Kabul||As India began repatriation of its personnel from Afghanistan, there were three special evacuees – Maya, Roobie and Bobby - highly trained sniffer dogs of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) who were to be brought back along with the embassy staff and 126 commandoes from the war-torn country following Taliban’s takeover.The director-general SS Deswal categorically told the second-in-command, Ravikant Gautam, in-charge of the security at the Indian embassy in Kabul that “at no cost the K9 soldiers should be left behind”.After all, Maya (female Labrador), Roobie (female Belgian Malinois) and Bobby (male Doberman), were the first responders to any threat faced by the Indian diplomats in the last three years from Pakistan-backed terror groups and thwarted many attempts.As soon as it was learnt that the second Indian Air Force (IAF) C-17 plane was on its way to Hamid Karzai airport for evacuating all the personnel on Tuesday, the handlers of Maya, Roobie and Bobby, made arrangements for the transportation of the canines who are all aged between 5 to 7 years. The first evacuation of around 40 staff of the Indian embassy was done on Monday.The flight reached Delhi on Tuesday late afternoon, following which the dogs were taken to ITBP’s Chhawla camp in South West Delhi, which has a special dog kennel. “They will rest and acclimatize with Indian weather for four to five weeks,” said an official at ITBP’s K9 unit.During their three years’ deployment, the canine soldiers played an important role in the security of the Indian embassy, which was considered to be the second most vulnerable establishment in Afghanistan after American bases.“They have been successfully carrying out anti-sabotage duties at Indian embassies at Kabul for past three years, checking every bag, parcel and article coming inside as well as sniffing any suspicious person. They detected several suspected IEDs (improvised explosive devices) during this time, saving lives of not only Indian diplomats and security personnel but also Afghan civilians working there for the Indian government,” said the officer cited above, without sharing specific details of the incidents.Raised and trained at elite National Training Centre for Dogs (NTCD) of ITBP at Bhanu in Panchkula, Maya, Roobie and Bobby will again be seen in action, this time for anti-Naxal operations in Chhattisgarh.The ITBP was deployed in Afghanistan in 2002 to secure the Indian embassies in Kabul and consulates at Jalalabad, Kandahar, Mazar-i-Sharif and Herat.Over 350 commandoes were responsible for the security of these assets and over the years, they thwarted many attacks on Indian diplomats.While the four consulates were shut on different dates over the last two months due to the Taliban’s advance, the embassy in Kabul was functional till Tuesday.One of the biggest attacks at the Indian embassy was carried out by Taliban’s Haqqani faction in association with Pakistan’s spy agency ISI on July 7, 2008, when a suicide bomber in a Toyota Corolla car tried to enter the premises of the embassy tailing the vehicle of Indian defence attaché Brigadier RD Mehta and Counsellor V Venkateshwara Rao. Two ITBP commandoes timely stopped the attacker’s car, saving many lives. The bombing killed 58 persons including Mehta, Rao and the two commandoes while 141 were wounded.Similarly, there have been many attempts by terrorists to breach the Indian embassy and consulates at Kabul, Mazar-e-Sharif, Jalalabad and Herat over the years but all have been thwarted by the ITBP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/itbps-canine-soldiers-among-personnel-evacuated-from-kabul-101629307601380.html

While hearing an intervention application (IA) moved by Bengaluru based organisation, Sangama, a division bench of Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice NS Sanjay Gowda said, “The state government has taken an innovative step of providing 1% reservation to transgenders in the Karnataka Civil Services General Recruitment (Rules), 1977. The state government shall consider issuing direction through an advisory to all state-owned corporations and statutory bodies to provide for similar reservations. The state shall place on record appropriate action taken within 6 weeks.” On July 21, 2020, the Karnataka government had informed the Karnataka High Court that it has made provision for one percent horizontal reservation for transgender persons in government employment. “It is submitted that similar horizontal reservation also must be provided for transgender persons in State Boards and state corporations so that transgender persons have equal opportunity in public employment as well. Many of such public boards and corporations have their own statutory provisions for recruitment and do not have their own statutory provisions for recruitment and do not necessarily follow the Karnataka Civil Services (General Recruitment) Rules,” read the petition filed by Sangama. Submitting that there are around 75-80 different state-owned corporations, senior advocate Jayna Kothari, representing the intervenor asked the government to issue a circular to consider reserving 1% for transgender persons in jobs. “We can’t implead each one of them,” she said. The counsel appearing for the state government submitted that these corporations and boards have their own rules and regulations and that the state government can’t coerce them to do something. The matter will be next heard on September 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/consider-1-reservation-for-transgenders-in-corporations-karnataka-hc-tells-state-101629305261317.html

Jaishankar, who chaired the UN Security Council's open debate on technology and peacekeeping, this was a reflection of the government’s deep commitment to ‘protecting the protectors’ as peacekeeping continued to play a crucial role in India’s vision for international peace and security.In collaboration with the UN, India launched UNITE AWARE, a technology platform for peacekeeping missions aimed at providing terrain-related information to peacekeepers. The launch came as India assumed the presidency of the 15-nation UN Security Council for August.“It gives me great pleasure to announce that India is supporting the UN in the rollout of the UNITE Aware Platform across select peacekeeping missions. It is based on the expectation that a peacekeeping operation can be visualized, coordinated and monitored on a real-time basis,” Jaishankar said in his address at the UN headquarters in New York.India has contributed $1.64 million towards the project and developed it in partnership with the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Operational Support.He said UN peacekeeping “simply cannot” afford to cede the information advantage to actors determined to undermine prospects for peace by using modern technology to aid their violent cause, adding 21st-century peacekeeping must be anchored in a strong ecosystem of technology and innovation that can facilitate such operations in implementing their mandates in complex environments.He said the international community must focus on operationally proven, cost-effective, widely available, reliable and field-serviceable technologies that must also prioritise mobility, both in the sense of agile manoeuvrability of mission assets and in the sense of the use of mobile digital / IT platforms.He called for contributing to ensure that technological improvements are continuous and are available on the ground, in the gear that peacekeepers carry and the weapons and tools they use to enhance their mobility, performance, endurance, range, and load-carrying capabilities while guaranteeing their safety and security.A four-point framework to meet contemporary threats include operationally proven and cost-effective technologies, a sound intelligence foundation, continuous technological improvements, and consistent training and capacity-building of peacekeepers in the realm of technology, Jaishankar said.“We are pleased to inform that the council has adopted a resolution on ‘accountability of crimes against UN peacekeepers’ as well as a presidential statement on ‘technology for peacekeeping’, the first such UN Security Council document on this topic,” Jaishankar said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-provided-2l-covid-vaccines-for-un-peacekeepers-jaishankar-says-101629303526245.html

The commander told my brother and other people from UP that Afghanistan was now under the control of the Taliban and Islamic law had been enforced in the country. Everyone had to follow the new law, else they should be ready to face the consequences,” Maurya said.“The passport of all the workers is with the factory owner, who assured them that once the work in the factory was completed he would make arrangements for their return home. Uncertainty prevails in Afghanistan and we cannot rely on the Taliban. All the workers have urged the Indian government to arrange for their safe return,” he said.The wife and three children of Ranjit staying in the village had urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath to arrange for the return of Ranjit and other people, he said.The family members of Nitish Kumar Gupta, a resident of Bhaluani village in Deoria district, are also praying for his safe return home. His father Srinand Gupta said, “We are in regular contact with Nitish on his mobile. The 28 people staying in the factory have been kept in separate rooms. The factory owner has told them not to venture out till the situation normalises”.“The factory owner said he did not have trained personnel to run the factory, so once the work was completed or he hired the local people, he would arrange for their return to India. Nitish as well as other workers want to leave Kabul as soon as possible,” he added.The anguish of the family members of Dinesh Chaudhary, a native of Rampur village and Jangbahadur, a resident of Shyamdeurwa in Maharajganj district is no different.Jangbahadur’’s wife Dharmawati said, “My husband called me on Tuesday. He said the situation in Kabul was deteriorating fast after the city fell to the Taliban. The threat issued by Taliban commanders has added to their agony. I along with my five daughters pray for his safe return home.”Anita, wife of Dinesh said, “Earlier my husband worked at Kandhar but around six months back he shifted to a factory in Kabul. I, my in-laws and two children stay in the village. The central government transported several people from Kabul on Tuesday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi should also arrange a flight for the return of my husband and other Indian workers trapped in the factory,” she said.Harkhu Chauhan, father of Dharmendra Chauhan of Narau village in Azamgarh district, said, “My son is also staying with other workers in the factory in Kabul. He called me on Tuesday evening and told me that they were getting meals and other facilities in the factory, but the movement of the armed Taliban fighters around the factory had triggered panic among them.”Shailendra Shukla, a resident of Dubauli village near Chauri- Chaura town in Gorakhpur district, said in a WhatsApp call from Kabul, “I work as a welder in a steel factory near Kabul. I arrived on July 16 with the hope to earn for the family but after the withdrawal of the US army and the advent of the Taliban, the situation changed fast. Now I and other workers are praying for our safe return home. The threat issued by the Taliban commander has added to our agony. The owner of the factory has told us not to venture outside else we might be targeted by the Taliban fighters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrants-trapped-in-kabul-fear-taliban-threats-as-families-worry-for-them-101629302141532.html

18-08-2021||India||Over 300 Dehradun residents stranded in Afghanistan, Uttarakhand CM assures help||Amid the crisis in war-torn Afghanistan following its capture by the Taliban, over 300 Dehradun residents who had gone for employment are stranded in the country while pleading with the government to evacuate them, HT has learnt. Among those stranded, the majority of them are ex-servicemen who used to work for private security agencies assisting the now collapsed elected government. They are stranded in major cities of the country including the capital Kabul, Kandhar and Herat. In Kabul alone, at least 300 people from Dehradun are stranded while waiting to get evacuated for India. Providing a glimpse of the sensitive situation in Afghanistan after the return of the Taliban, a group of men from Dehradun who were working for Kabul had sent a video to their families and relatives back home in which they could be seen pleading the Central government to evacuate them as soon as possible. One of them, shooting the video with his mobile phone, said, “We are 140 men stranded here in Kabul since last four days. We all are in a single room with nothing proper to eat. Nor have we slept for the last few days, but sitting in a cramped situation in one room.” “We are appealing to the government to evacuate us as soon as possible from here to India. We will be highly grateful as the situation outside is very dangerous,” said the man in the video whose name couldn’t be revealed due to security reasons. One of them, while speaking to HT over WhatsApp while describing the situation said, “After the regime change, our employer had abandoned us to our fate without helping us in leaving the country.” “The situation outside is very dangerous and uncertain. The Taliban are roaming and patrolling the streets outside and we don’t know what to do. We have asked for help from the ministry of external affairs for evacuation who have assured us of help. But, we don’t know how will it happen and when will it happen. We just want to go home,” said the man, a resident of Clement Town area of Dehradun. Another man from Dehradun who is stranded with at least 100 others in Kandhar shared similar fears“We all are here in a big hall of our office compound with the Taliban patrolling the streets instead of police. However, they haven’t done anything yet and assured us that they will let us go without any harm, once the situation normalises. We are getting proper food which is not a problem. The only thing that is bothering us right now is when will we be able to leave,” said the man on the condition of anonymity. He added that “About 90% of the men stranded in our group hail from Dehradun while the remaining are from Darjeeling.” While the men are stranded in Afghanistan waiting to get evacuated, their family members in Dehradun are spending tense days worrying about their safety. Ruchi Thakuri, the wife of a man stranded in Kabul, said, “Since the quick political developments on Sunday, I am very worried about my husband. I am just stuck to TV and mobile all the time to know when they would be evacuated.” “I was able to speak to him yesterday night and he said that they all are safe but worried for their evacuation. We appeal to the government to help them get back to India as soon as possible,” she said. Amid the reports of residents of the state stranded in Afghanistan, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Wednesday said, “The state will do everything possible to get them back home.” “We have apprised the officials of the ministry of external affairs and are in constant touch with them for the evacuation of all the people of Uttarakhand who are stranded in Afghanistan. We will bring them back soon while ensuring their safety. The Centre is working on it,” said Dhami.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-300-dehradun-residents-stranded-in-afghanistan-uttarakhand-cm-assures-help-101629295298564.html

Railways will issue a fresh tender for the same,” a senior ministry official said.Of the 12 clusters put up for bidding, only three saw any bid at all, the official said.The national carrier, on July 1, 2020, began the formal process of allowing private trains on 109 routes—a process that aimed to, for the first time, open up one of the government’s most prominent enterprises. However, only two bidders, the Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) and was Megha Engineering & Infrastructures evinced interest in the financial bidding stage where IRCTC majority-owned by the government was touted to get the contract after quoting a higher revenue share figure. This, officials said, raised questions on the purpose of running trains via private players.According to the ministry, the planned investment was estimated at around ₹30,000 crores, and a majority of the rakes (70%) will have to be manufactured in India; private entities cleared to run the train services shall be responsible for financing, procuring, operating and maintaining the trains. Winning bidders were to be provided a concession period of 35 years on a revenue.Indian Railways in July last year planned to introduce private trains on its network in phases, with the first dozen due to start running in the 2023-24 financial year and all 151 by 2027. According to the railway ministry’s projections, the transporter was supposed to will select the companies that will run the private trains by April 2021; the first 12 were expected to start plying by 2023-24, followed by 45 more in FY 2024-25, the next 50 in FY 2025-26 and the last 44 by 2026-27.The ministry last year issued what is known as a request for qualification (RFQ) private companies to run 151 trains spread over these routes, laying down specific conditions that will need to be met in a move that is meant to “introduce modern technologies and world-class services” for one of India’s most popular modes of transport.The government planned to run the trains along 12 clusters across the Indian Railways’ network. It has planned two clusters each in Delhi and Mumbai, and one cluster each in Secunderabad, Chennai, Howrah, Jaipur, Prayagraj, Chandigarh, Bengaluru, and Patna.In October last year, the Indian Railways has received a total of 120 applications from 15 firms including L&T, GMR and Welspun in response to its Request for Quotation inviting private players to run trains on key routesThe firms which made the applications for the clusters included Arvind Aviation, BHEL, Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarrriles, S.A, Cube Highways and Infrastructure III Pvt Ltd, Gateway Rail Freight Limited, GMR Highways Limited, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited, IRB Infrastructure Developers Limited.The others were L&T Infrastructure Development Projects Limited, Malempati Power Private Limited, Megha Engineering and Infrastructures Limited, PNC Infratech Ltd, RK Associates and Hoteliers Pvt Ltd, Sainath Sales and Services Pvt Ltd and Welspun Enterprises Limited. Overall, 14 Indian firms and one Spanish firm had evinced interest in the beginning to run private trains in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-scraps-rs-30k-cr-private-trains-tender-railways-to-re-evaluate-process-101629294521434.html

Last time, the first lady your president's wife she came to attend the function in Ayodhya. You must visit Ayodhya and you must know the history of Ayodhya. You will be proud," PM Modi told Park Tae-sang during the event.Ayodhya and Korea have a deep historical connection through the legendary Princess Suriratna of Ayodhya, who traveled to Korea in 48 CE and married Korean King Suro, according to an earlier PIB statement.South Korean first lady Kim-Jung Sook had attended the groundbreaking ceremony of the Queen Huh Memorial at Queen Huh Park in Ayodhya in November 2018.Meanwhile, PM Modi also fulfilled his promise and had ice cream with two-time Olympic medallist PV Sindhu when he hosted the Indian athletes at his residence.Mirabai Chanu had opened India's medals tally in Tokyo Olympics as she bagged a silver in the Women's 49kg category.

18-08-2021||India||Cabinet nod for ₹11,040cr scheme to boost oil palm farming||To encourage palm oil production in India and decrease its import, the Centre has approved a plan named National Mission on Edible Oils – Oil Palm, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said on Wednesday, adding that the government has earmarked ₹11,040 crore for the plan. North Eastern Regional Agriculture Market Corporation Limited will also be getting a revival package of ₹70.45 crore.The decision comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the new Central scheme on August 15 during his Independence Day speech at Red Fort.“India is dependent on imports of edible oil… we import edible oil in large quantities, 56% of which is palm oil… It has been seen that India can cultivate around 2,800,000 hectares of land for palm oil trees, especially in the northeast region, where over 900,000 hectares is feasible for such cultivation,” he said.Also Read | Centre cuts palm oil duties, eases imports to cushion pricesTomar was speaking at a press briefing in the national Capital; he was accompanied by information and broadcasting minister Anurag Singh Thakur.Tomar said the new scheme aims to cover palm oil tress in an additional area of 650,000 hectares by 2025-26 and thereby reaching the target of 1 million hectares.With this, the domestic production of crude palm oil (CPO) is expected to go up to 1.12 million tonnes by 2025-26 and up to 2.8 million tonnes by 2029-30.“The plan is aimed at increasing the cultivation of palm oil trees from current 350,000 hectares to 1 million hectares and oil production will also increase to 2.8 million tonnes by 2030,” he said, adding that this will also improve the economy of the northeastern regions.He said that most states have been working to increase the production of palm oil but are facing several challenges. “The plant of palm oil takes five years to bear fruit, and be profitable to farmers; prices of oil are also volatile… This causes fear among palm oil farmers,” he said.He added that in northeast India, the roads leading to the region are terraneous, thereby causing a dearth of processing industries there. “The farmers are motivated to cultivate only in the presence of processing industries, and industries too are set up only when there is good cultivation,” he said, adding that this plan has been introduced to address all these crises. Regarding farmers’ fear of price fluctuation, he said that the Centre will fix the cost of raw materials needed for palm oil production. “Like MSP (minimum support price) … we will fix the price of this raw material (cultivated by farmers)… This will motivate the farmers, and in case prices of the raw material crops drop, the government will pay the differential amount to farmers through DBT (direct bank transfer),” he said.The assistance to oil palm growers for planting material has been increased from ₹12,000 per hectare to ₹29,000 per hectare. Further, substantial increase has been made for maintenance and inter-cropping interventions, he said. “A special assistance at ₹250 per plant is being given to replant old gardens for rejuvenation of old gardens,” Tomar said.“Almost ₹11,000 crore will be spent by the Centre under this scheme. In most states, the Centre will give 60% of assistance and states will lend 40%, while in the northeast 90% of assistance will be given by the Centre,” he said.He added that there have also been arrangements by the government to assist such farmers by helping them with the improvement of land and constructing boundary walls of their farms. India meets about two-thirds of its edible oil demand through imports.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-nod-for-rs-11-040cr-scheme-to-boost-oil-palm-farming-101629291518605.html

18-08-2021||India||Netaji death anniversary: TMC leader wants proof as Congress pays tribute||The newly reignited bonhomie between the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress and the grand old party in their bid to stitch a united opposition against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) hit a minor hurdle on Wednesday over the commemoration of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose’s death anniversary.TMC spokesperson and former Rajya Sabha MP Kunal Ghosh hit out at the Congress for its tweet on Netaji’s death anniversary and said this was akin to playing with the emotions of Bengal and India as details of the legendary freedom fighter’s demise is yet to be made public. He said both the Congress and BJP governments did not make any effort to find out the facts regarding the last moments of Bose.Earlier in the day, the Congress paid tribute to Netaji with an image that had a famous quote of the revolutionary leader along with his birth and death dates (January 23, 1897 - August 18, 1947).Strongly object to this tweet. This date of death is not proved. Both Congress and BJP govt didn't try to find out the real facts regarding the last moments of Netaji. Don't play with emotions of Bengal and India. First prove the death. Publish the classified files. https://t.co/FmjSoZ3oudStating his objections to the tweet, Ghosh asked the grand old party to “first prove the death and publish (related) classified files”.Also read | Firebrand who shaped Bengal’s politics, cultureWhile the Congress has not made any further comment over the issue, a tweet of former Union minister and BJP leader Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank on the same issue has now been removed after Ghosh trained his guns on him as well. He asked Pokhriyal to prove Netaji’s death before trying to rewrite history.All parties, including the BJP, have been trying to cash in on Bose’s legacy over the years with new politics emerging over the revolutionary leader’s 125th birthday celebrations. While the central government has announced that Netaji’s birth anniversary will be celebrated as Parakram Diwas, the Trinamool government in Bengal has said the day should be remembered as Desh Prem Diwas.Also read | A Delhi village that celebrates Subhas Chandra Bose like no otherHowever, a TMC spokesperson’s open attack on the Congress over the issue at a time when senior functionaries, including Banerjee, are trying to put a united front against the BJP ahead of the next general election, has come as a surprise to many.In 2016, the Narendra Modi government had declassified several files related to Bose and later said he had lost his life in a crash, while in 2019, the Press Information Bureau declared August 18 as the date of Netaji’s death. However, all of these continue to be contested by many, including some of his family members, amid several theories behind Netaji going missing and possible death. A PIB tweet in this regard also had to be withdrawn following protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/netaji-death-anniversary-tmc-leader-wants-proof-as-congress-pays-tribute-101629282010114.html

The high prices are forcing women to go back to cow dung cakes and firewood, which are not good for women’s health,” said Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate.The LPG cylinder price was raised on Tuesday. The cost of LPG cylinder in Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai now is ₹860, ₹886, ₹860 and ₹875.Also Read | LPG cylinder price hiked by ₹25: Check latest rates hereShrinate cited the import parity price, which determines the LPG price in the country, and added the cylinders should not cost more than ₹600.

Why is the government not doing anything to lower the prices?”She took a dig at the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana for the distribution of free LPG connections to the poor women. “How many people you have given LPG connections can actually afford a cylinder at ₹860?”An LPG cylinder cost ₹809 on June 1 and ₹834 on July 1.Between January 1 and August 17, the price of domestic LPG cylinders has gone up by ₹165.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-slams-government-over-lpg-price-increase-101629275497407.html
18-08-2021||India||Delhi court discharges Shashi Tharoor of all charges: What was Sunanda Pushkar death case||The Delhi court on Wednesday cleared senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor of all charges related to the case of his wife Sunanda Pushkar's death. The verdict was pronounced after the virtual hearing.Tharoor's advocate Vikas Pahwa sought the discharge order saying that there was no evidence that proves Tharoor had any involvement in the death of his wife. He also cited findings by the Special Investigation that already exonerated the politician of all the charges.The police have accused Tharoor of abetment to suicide and cruelty against Pushkar who was found dead in a luxury hotel in Delhi in 2014.Following the order, Tharoor said, the allegations meant "seven and a half years of absolute torture" for him. "I am so grateful, it had been seven and a half years and it was an absolute torture," he said moments after judge Geetanjali Goel pronounced him "discharged" from all charges.What is the Sunanda Pushkar death case?A businesswoman by profession, Pushkar was found dead at Delhi’s Leela Palace hotel under mysterious circumstances. She had moved with her husband Tharoor in the hotel as their house was under maintenance. At that time, the initial reports had suggested that Pushkar dies of suicide.Later, the reports stated the cause of death as "unnatural." In the autopsy report, the doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences found injury marks on her body. In the later stage of the investigation, the police found traces of Alprazolam, an anti-depressant, and Excedrin, a painkiller in her body.In July the same year, the doctor who was leading the panel that conducted the postmortem on Pushkar alleged that he was pressured to give a false report in the case, according to a media report.Following this, the Sub-Divisional Magistrate ordered an inquiry into the case to ascertain the cause of her death whether it was poisoning, murder or suicide.In 2015, the Delhi police filed an FIR claiming to say that it was a murder.During the investigation, Pushkar's domestic help alleged that she had often fought with Tharoor. The house help also claimed that days before her death she had threatened Tharoor that she would "disclose everything" and after which he would be "finished".In May 2018, Delhi police charged Tharoor with abetment to suicide of his wife and marital cruelty under sections 306 and 498A of the Indian Penal Code. However, Tharoor refuted all the charges.He was granted anticipatory bail in the matter by a Sessions Court in July 2018. Following that order, a magisterial court converted the anticipatory bail into regular bail after he appeared before it on July 7 in pursuance to the summons issued by the Metropolitan Magistrate in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-court-discharges-shashi-tharoor-of-all-charges-what-was-sunanda-pushkar-death-case-101629275145226.html
18-08-2021||India||Shiv Sena slams Maharashtra governor over delay in MLC nominations||Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana on Wednesday stepped up its attack on Maharashtra governor over the delay in nominating 12 people-- recommended by the state government-- to the upper house of the state legislature, and alleged that while Bhagat Singh Koshyari was acting like an “agent” of the Central government, Maharashtra’s ruling coalition will not “surrender” like former Afghanistan president Ashraf Ghani.The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government had submitted 12 names to be nominated to the Legislative Council from the governor’s quota to Koshyari on November 6 last year but despite repeated reminders, he hasn’t approved it.The Saamana editorial said the governor seems to have decided to sit on the file till a government of his choice comes to power in Maharashtra. “The governor says, forget the appointments of 12 members till the government of his (governor’s choice) takes oath in Maharashtra,” said the editorial. In a reference to Bombay high court’s recent remarks that “eight months seems to be beyond reasonable time” for the governor to decide on the recommendations of the state cabinet, the Saamana editorial said “the reluctance to abide by the constitution” could prove to be tricky for the governor.“If the governor breaks the framework of the constitution, then he will lose his dignity. His own people are playing with his dignity… Koshyari’s behaviour as the governor is unconstitutional and politically biased… There can be no change of guard using Raj Bhavan and no one surrenders like former Afghanistan president Ashraf Ghani. It was seen in West Bengal and Maharashtra,” the editorial said, also referring to power eluding the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Maharashtra and West Bengal after the last assembly elections in the two states.The Sena mouthpiece claimed that the governor was Centre’s “political agent”. “Even after a reminder, the file of appointment of 12 members does not move forward. It means [that] his [governor’s] mind is not clear and he is under pressure from the top...,” it added. “In which month, will the governor take the decision?” asked the editorial. The mouthpiece further claimed that senior Congress legislator Sharad Ranpise, during Independence Day celebration in Pune, asked the governor about the delay in the nominations. “The Governor responded by asking Ranpise why he was insisting on the appointments when the government was not? ... What does the governor mean by saying that the government should insist on it? Does it mean that one has to clap loudly or beat utensils and ring bells to attract his attention?” asked the editorial.Maharashtra BJP spokesperson said they do not comment on Saamana editorials as a matter of policy. The Raj Bhavan, too, has not responded to the allegations made in Saamana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-slams-maharashtra-governor-over-delay-in-mlc-nominations-101629273816767.html

18-08-2021||India||Supreme Court junks Maha govt plea challenging CBI probe against ex-home minister Anil Deshmukh||The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a plea of the Maharashtra government seeking to set aside two paragraphs related to transfer and posting of police officers, reinstatement of an officer from the CBI’s FIR against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh.A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said that it is inclined to interfere with the July 22 order of the Bombay High Court and dismissed the petition. The top court said that it cannot dilute the direction of a constitutional court ordering a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe by drawing a line for the agency on which aspect the investigation should be done.“CBI has to investigate all aspects of the allegations and we cannot limit them. This will be like denuding the powers of a constitutional court,” the bench said.It said that an impression is being created that the state is trying to protect the former home minister by not allowing the probe on the aspect of transfer and posting of police officers and reinstatement of additional police inspector Sachin Waze.Advocate Rahul Chitnis, appearing for the Maharashtra government, said the state has withdrawn consent for the CBI probe and the High Court direction for a probe was limited to allegations of collection of money from bars and restaurants and not on transfer, posting of police officers, and reinstatement of Waje into the police force.On July 22, the High Court said the CBI can inquire into the transfer and postings of police personnel and the reinstatement of Waze in the Mumbai Police force "so far as this has a nexus with Maharashtra's former home minister Anil Deshmukh and his associates".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-junks-maha-govt-plea-challenging-cbi-probe-against-ex-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-101629270827927.html

The top court said that the Army's policy decision to not allow women to appear for the exam is based on "gender discrimination".The examination is slated to be held on September 5.The bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy said that admissions will be subject to the final orders of the court.The Supreme Court was hearing a petition filed by lawyer Kush Kalra which sought a direction to the concerned authorities to allow eligible female candidates to appear form examination and train at the NDA.Kalra said in his plea that the categorical exclusion of eligible female candidates from entering the National Defence Academy is not constitutionally justifiable and is simply done on the basis of their sex.He referred to the February last year landmark verdict in which the apex court had directed that women officers in the Army be granted permanent commission and command postings.The Centre, meanwhile, told the court on Tuesday that women are being granted equal opportunity in the armed forces and there is no violation of any fundamental right.In an affidavit, the Centre said that the NDA is only one of the various modes of entries for recruitment in the armed forces, pointing out that in the Army, on an average 1,470 officers are commissioned which includes 670 officers from Indian Military Academy (IMA) and NDA apart from Officers Training Academy (OTA) where both men and women officers are commissioned through UPSC and non-UPSC modes.Apart from this, on an average, 453 officers (men and women) are commissioned as Short Service Commissioned officers through SSC (Non-Technical) and SSC (Technical) through UPSC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-allows-women-to-appear-for-nda-exam-101629270687140.html

18-08-2021||India||NGT asks Odisha government to notify 14 elephant corridors, ecologists cheer||The National Green Tribunal on Tuesday asked the Odisha government to notify 14 elephant corridors in the state within next two months, realising a long-standing demand of elephant conservationists.In an order passed by the Eastern Zonal bench of NGT, judicial member B Amit Sthalekar and expert member Saibal Dasgupta asked for notification of the 14 corridors identified by Asian Nature Conservation Foundation, a non-profit trust involved in conservation of Asian elephants in 13 of the 30 districts within two months.Wildlife conservationist Biswajit Mohanty, through his NGO Wildlife Society of Odisha, had moved the NGT alleging that though the principal chief conservator of forests (Wildlife) had submitted details of elephant corridors in Odisha to the forest and environment department in the state in 2012 for identification of 14 corridors with a total area of 870.61 sq. kms, no action was taken for their formal notification under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. He further stated that the state had spent ₹20 crores in improving the corridors, but it did not issue a formal notification to secure them legally.Mohanty submitted to the NGT that the elephant corridors, being a part of the elephant ecology, needed to be notified as ecological sensitive zones under Section 3 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, which empowers the government to keep industries out of a notified restricted area.Mohanty’s lawyer Sankar Pani said the NGT order will give legal sanctity to the elephant corridors, making their movement from one habitat to another safe. An elephant corridor also helps them intermingle and breed with elephants outside their gene pool. These corridors also reduce the scope of human-animal conflicts. However, such corridors face threats from poaching, agricultural activity, mining, vehicular traffic, development of resorts, electrical fencing, etc, an environmentalist said.The NGT order comes in the wake of rising elephant deaths in Odisha since 2001. As against 33 elephant deaths per year on an average between 1990 and 2000, 46 yearly deaths were reported on an average between 2001 and 2010, which further increased to 76 elephant deaths since 2010.The elephant landscape too has changed dramatically in the last two decades with Keonjhar district, which had 112 elephants in 2002, left with only 40 now due to large scale mining, and Dhenkanal district, which had 81 elephants in 2002, now has 169, due to green area fed by Rengali irrigation canals. Similarly, 70 odd elephants from the Chandaka sanctuary migrated to Ganjam, Nayagarh and Cuttack districts, and many of them were killed by trains and electrocution in Ganjam.Mining activities for coal, Iron Ore, Bauxite, Manganese etc in Keonjhar, Sundargarh, Jharsuguda and Angul have left little space for elephants, while illegal stone and morrum quarries too have disturbed the elephant habitats and movement paths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ngt-asks-odisha-government-to-notify-14-elephant-corridors-ecologists-cheer-101629267336166.html

18-08-2021||India||Chargesheet against Shashi Tharoor was without any base, says lawyer||A Delhi court on Wednesday discharged Congress MP Shashi Tharoor in the Sunanda Pushkar death case. Tharoor, former union minister, who is currently on bail in the case, was chargesheeted by Delhi Police under Sections 498-A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) and 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Tharoor's wife Pushkar was found dead in the suite of a luxury hotel in the city on the night of January 17, 2014, following which the police had charged Tharoor with abetment to suicide, among other charges. The Congress MP was present at the court when the verdict was given. "It had been seven and half years and it was torture," Tharoor said, thanking the court.The order was pronounced by special judge Geetanjali Goel. The last hearing in this matter was on April 12 when the court reserved the orders.An FIR against Shashi Tharoor was filed in 2015 regarding Sunanda Pushkar's death. Apart from the charges of abetment to suicide, he was also accused of marital cruelty.Earlier, Public Prosecutor Atul Srivastava said Pushkar was subjected to mental cruelty which led to her deteriorating. It was not an accidental death, the public prosecutor contended relying on the post mortem report which suggests that the cause of death is poisoning which could be oral or injected.Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, who represented Tharoor argued that the prosecution failed to ascertain the cause of Sunanda Pushkar's death between 2014 and 2017. It was also submitted that the doctors who conducted the preliminary post mortem report went beyond their jurisdiction by relying on circumstantial evidence."If you cannot establish suicide, then there can be no sec. 306 case. First, you have to establish there has been a suicide. From 2014 to 2017, it has been 4 years. They have given their opinion, it's neither suicide nor homicide. Again a null in the investigation. Even when the report said there was no suicide, they registered a case under Section 302. They don't say it's suicide. Suicide cannot be without intent. I am not talking abetment at the moment. I am talking about suicide For suicide, there has to be intent," he submitted.The statement of Sunanda Pushkar's son also played a crucial role in the case. In his statement, he had said, "In the Mortuary of AIIMS, I asked the doctor who conducted the post mortem about the case of death, he (doctor) responded that there is no foul play or poisoning but the same doctor later went into the media and said that death is due to poisoning. Shashi can't harm even a fly."A day before Sunanda Pushkar's death, she engaged with Pakistani journalist Mehr Tarat in a Twitter spat over Tharoor's alleged affair with Mehr. Reports said doctors revealed that Pushkar had several injury marks on ger hands which led the sub-divisional mafistrate to conclude that it was a case of poisoning. There were reports of doctor claiming to be under pressure to alter the autopsy report. In 2015, the Delhi Police concluded that Pushkar was murdered. In 2018, the chargesheet was filed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-court-discharges-shashi-tharoor-in-sunanda-pushkar-death-case-101629265669810.html

His tweet accompanying the video snippet talked about discussions around health and "inspiring anecdotes". Prime Minister Modi had met India's 2020 Tokyo Olympic contingent on Monday at his residence for breakfast."From having ice-creams and Churma to discussing good health and fitness, from inspiring anecdotes to lighter moments...watch what happened when I had the opportunity to host India's #Tokyo2020 contingent at 7, LKM," PM Modi said in his tweet.In the video, PM Modi can be seen talking to Tokyo Olympics gold medallist Neeraj Chopra, archer Deepika Kumari, silver medallist wrestler Ravi Dahiya and fencer Bhawani Devi among others.While interacting with Chopra, PM Modi said, "...I have seen that success doesn't get to your head and loss doesn't stay in your mind. When you attempted the second throw, you already entered into celebratory mode. One needs a lot of confidence to reach to this level, and a lot of knowledge about their game as well as the opponent's. How was this possible?" PM Modi asked Chopra. To this, the Javelin thrower said, "We had been training for a lot of years for this, so when you make the throw, the effort which was put into it sometimes tells you that it was your best throw. That confidence comes from regular training. My training was very good."PM Modi offered ice cream to Olympics medal winner PV Sindhu during his interaction with the Indian contingent. On an earlier occasion, the Prime Minister had told her that they will eat ice cream together after her return from Tokyo. Sindhu even shared the pictures of that moment on Twitter with the caption, "Glad to have got the opportunity to finally have an ice cream with our Hon’ble PM @narendramodi ji."PM Modi urged archer Deepika Kumari, who missed out on a podium finish at the Tokyo Olympics, not to be disheartened and said that a sportsperson should never lose hope.PM Modi showered praise on Bhawani Devi, who became the first fencer to represent India at Olympics. "Your contribution is that you have inspired young generation of the country to take up this sport (fencing)," PM Modi said.He also interacted with Olympics silver medalist Mirabai Chanu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ice-creams-churma-pm-modi-shares-glimpses-of-interaction-with-tokyo-2020-contingent-101629260502042.html

They condemned the continued incarceration.Jesuit priest Stan Swamy, 84, the oldest of 16 activists and lawyers arrested on charges of conspiring to foment violence at Bhima Koregaon under an anti-terror law, died in July after spending over eight months in jail awaiting trial.Those still in custody in the case include Anand Teltumbde, Hany Babu, Shoma Sen, Jyoti Jagtap, Ramesh Gaichor, Sagar Gorkhe, Sudhir Dhawale, Mahesh Raut, Arun Ferreira, Surendra Gadling, Sudha Bharadwaj, Gautam Navlakha, Rona Wilson, and Vernon Gonsalves.Also Read | Bhima Koregaon commission: Narrative of events disputed by Dalit’s testimonyThe National Investigation Agency has claimed the Bhima Koregaon violence was a “well-chalked-out strategy” for which the accused were in touch with Maoist leaders. In February, Wilson moved the Bombay high court seeking the quashing of criminal proceedings against him after an American digital forensics consulting company concluded that fabricated evidence was planted in the electronic evidence including a laptop and thumb drive. The devices were seized from his residence in April 2018, and he was arrested two months later over it.The statement said all the arrested have worked for the assertion of the most oppressed and marginalised in society and “spoken out against majoritarian Brahmanical Hindutva forces, Brahmanical patriarchy and upheld the right to life, land, livelihood and dignity.” It added Swamy died as an undertrial due to “apathy and sheer criminal neglect”.“Along with timely justice, it is imperative that his co-accused are guaranteed the fundamental right to a life with dignity.”The signatories to the statement include writer Amitav Ghosh, filmmaker Anand Patwardhan, and academic Zoya Hasan. They accused the government of “protecting” the perpetrators of violence against marginalised and oppressed communities. “These are the actions of a retributive regime, a regime that upholds Brahmanical Hindutva fascism beneath the veneer of a constitutional democracy.”The statement referred to the Pegasus snooping controversy and condemned the “use of digital surveillance as a weapon by the government”.

The comments from SP member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal, Shafiqur Rahman Barq, drew sharp reaction from chief minister Yogi Adityanath.Barq made the comments while interacting with reporters on Monday, a day after the Taliban captured the presidential palace in Kabul. Barq said the Taliban want to free their country and it was Afghanistan's internal matter, according to news agency PTI.The Samajwadi Party leader called the Taliban a force that did not allow Russia or the United States to establish themselves in Afghanistan "and now they want to run their own country".He further said that when India was under British rule, the entire nation fought for Independence. "They want to be free. This is their personal matter. How can we interfere?" he added.Reacting to the comments, Adityanath said in state legislature, “He was shamelessly supporting the Taliban. It means supporting their barbaric act. We are a parliamentary democracy. Where are we heading? We are supporting people who are a blot on humanity."Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya compared Barq’s comments with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's remarks after Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan. Maurya said he had not personally heard the remark. "But if this type of statement has been given then there is no difference between that person and Imran Khan," he said.Khan had on Monday supported the Taliban takeover of Kabul, saying Afghanistan has broken the "shackles of slavery".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taliban-want-to-free-their-country-sp-leader-faces-flak-for-remarks-101629257364189.html

She was made a permanent judge two years later.Justice Nagarathna’s father, ES Venkataramiah, was the CJI for almost six months in 1989. If cleared by the Union government, justice Nagarathna will be the CJI for little over a month in 2027.Also Read | Nine names cleared, India may get 1st woman CJI in ’27In November 2009, she, along with two other judges of the Karnataka HC were locked in a court room by a group of protesting lawyers but she braved the situation in a dignified manner. She later said: “We are not angry, but we are sad that the Bar has done this to us. We have to hang our heads in shame.”In 2012, justice Nagarathna delivered a judgment emphasising on the need to regulate electronic media. “While truthful dissemination of information is an essential requirement of any broadcasting channel, sensationalism in the form of ‘Breaking News’, ‘Flash News’ or in any other form must be curbed,” she wrote in her judgment.While urging the Union government to consider setting up an autonomous and statutory mechanism to regulate broadcast media, justice Nagarathna clarified that the concept of regulation should not be understood to mean control by the government or the powers that be.In a 2019 judgment, she ruled that a temple is not a “commercial establishment” and hence, employees of a temple in Karnataka are not entitled to gratuity under Payments of Gratuity Act. She held that a temple employee will be entitled to gratuity benefits under the Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowment Act, which is a special law enacted in the state and not under the Payments of Gratuity Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-is-justice-bv-nagarathna-the-judge-poised-to-become-1st-woman-cji-in-2027-101629256715532.html

"It sounds as if there are at least two Malayali Taliban here -- one who says "samsarikkette" around 9-second mark and another who understands him!" Tharoor wrote sharing a video that was originally shared on a Twitter account that goes by the name Ramiz. Ramiz later clarified that there are no Kerala-origin fighters in the rank and file of Taliban. "They are Baloch from Zabul province who speak Brahvi and Bravhi language is widely spokes among them. It is a Dravidian language which is very similar to Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam etc," Ramiz, who claims to be interested in conflict journalism, wrote.It sounds as if there are at least two Malayali Taliban here — one who says “samsarikkette” around the 8-second mark & another who understands him! https://t.co/SSdrhTLsBGTo Ramiz's explanation, Tharoor said that it is indeed interesting and only linguists can figure this out. "But there have indeed been misguided Malayalis who joined the Taliban, so that possibility cannot be ruled out entirely," the MP wrote drawing wrath on social media.Twitter users accused Tharoor of branding the entire Malayali community as terrorist sympathisers because of just one word. Such a statement should not come from the MP, one user said, as it would only fuel "right wing's hate campaign against Kerala". Tharoor said it's because he is the MP that he is aware of the situation. In past, he was approached by Kerala women whose daughters were stuck in Afghanistan after "having been taken there by their misguided husbands," Tharoor wrote adding that he had also arranged a meeting with then external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj on this issue. "Obviously, it's as an MP that I am aware of the situation," he wrote.I have been approached by Kerala mothers whose daughters are stuck in Afghanistan after having been taken there by their misguided husbands. I arranged a meeting w/ EAM SushmaSwaraj ji for a constituent to plead her case. Obviously it’s as an MP that I’m aware of the situation.Then Tharoor shared a news article about Nimisha Fathima, a Keralite woman who landed in Afghanistan jail following the killing of her IS husband a couple of years ago, and wrote, "I am sure all those who decried my tweet about the possibility of Malayalis in the Taliban will now notice the ones who were released from the government’s prisons today."The news article of Matrubhumi that Tharoor shared said that the Taliban released over 5,000 prisoners -- mostly belonging to Taliban and Al Qaeda -- from Kabul jails. According to the report, there were eight Keralites among those who were freed including Nimisha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/misguided-malayalis-who-joined-taliban-shashi-tharoor-s-tweet-sparks-row-101629248182000.html
18-08-2021||India||India evacuates diplomatic staff amid Afghan turmoil||India on Tuesday withdrew its ambassador and diplomatic staff from Kabul, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a high-level meeting during which he directed officials to ensure all Indian nationals are evacuated safely from war-torn Afghanistan.Some 150 people, including India’s ambassador to Afghanistan Rudrendra Tandon, were brought back on a C-17 Globemaster heavy lift aircraft from the Afghanistan capital on Tuesday, a day after 45 diplomats and security personnel were flown in similarly as part of an extensive evacuation programme kept tightly under wraps and put into motion after Indian side received credible inputs about possible threats from rouge elements and Pakistani terror groups.PM Modi held a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) and, according to officials aware of the discussions, issued directions to ensure all Indian nationals are brought back safely, and that India is able to extend assistance to Afghan citizens requiring it.“In view of the prevailing situation in Kabul, it was decided that our embassy personnel would be immediately moved to India. This movement has been completed in two phases and the ambassador and all other India-based personnel have reached New Delhi [on Tuesday] afternoon,” the external affairs ministry said earlier in the day.India sent two C-17s, which flew into Kabul using a circuitous route through Iranian airspace and over the Arabian Sea in order to avoid flying over Pakistan or spending too much time in the uncontrolled Afghan airspace. As the Kabul airport is small and the aircraft were offered slots of limited duration, the C-17s halted in the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe till it was time for them to fly into Kabul, said people aware of the matter.The second of these flights landed in Gujarat’s Jamnagar on Tuesday afternoon.The withdrawal of the ambassador and other staff from Kabul reflected India’s misgivings about Taliban’s assurances that all embassies and diplomats would be provided security. Taliban spokesman Suhail Saheen had tweeted on Monday night that no problems will be created for diplomats, embassies and charitable workers but this failed to reassure the Indian side.Tandon, who had taken up his assignment in Kabul only in August last year, told reporters during an interaction at the Jamnagar airbase, where the C-17 jet halted to refuel, that some Indian citizens were still in Afghanistan and Air India would continue operating flights from Kabul as long as the airport there remains functional to bring them back.He added: “As you know, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan no longer exists and the situation is quite fluid now.”Air India has temporarily suspended its flights to Kabul because of conditions at the airport, but the MEA has opened a help desk and will ensure that anyone stuck in Kabul is brought back, he said.According to another official aware of the evacuation efforts at Kabul, the Indian ministry of external affairs and security officials started bringing evacuees to the Kabul airport from Monday as negotiations were undertaken with Taliban and other terrorist groups manning 15 check posts that lay between the Indian mission in Kabul to the international airport.Other people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that at least 300 Indian nationals, including those working for Western firms and other professionals, were believed to be in Afghanistan. Flights by Air India to bring back these Indians are expected to resume once the civilian side of Kabul’s Hamid Karzai international airport reopens.The airport, currently under the control of US troops, was closed on Monday following chaotic scenes as thousands of Afghans seeking to flee the Taliban entered the facility and marched on to the tarmac.External affairs minister S Jaishankar was involved in efforts to oversee the departure of the evacuation flights. At almost 3 am on Tuesday, he tweeted about his discussions in this regard with US secretary of state Antony Blinken: “Discussed latest developments in Afghanistan with @SecBlinken. Underlined the urgency of restoring airport operations in Kabul.”On Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security to assess the situation in Afghanistan. The meeting was attended by home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and Tandon.Meanwhile, the Union home ministry announced Tuesday it had reviewed visa provisions in view of the situation and introduced a new category of electronic visas called “e-Emergency X-Misc Visa” to fast-track applications by Afghan nationals.The people cited above said the Indian embassy in Kabul was technically not shut down as it is still being manned by local Afghan staff – an arrangement similar to the one made for the consulates in Kandahar and Mazar-e-Sharif, from where all Indian staff were pulled out in recently weeks. The local staff have been given specific assignments and are being paid their salaries.The decision regarding the withdrawal of India’s diplomatic personnel and other staff was based on two factors – the security of the personnel and ensuring that their departure was not perceived as abandonment by Afghan partners. An earlier Indian assessment had suggested the Taliban would continue negotiations in order to gain legitimacy, at least till August 31, when the US drawdown was to be completed, but the situation changed swiftly as the Taliban marched towards Kabul over the weekend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-evacuates-diplomatic-staff-amid-afghan-turmoil-101629247203647.html

The court had on August 6 adjourned hearing the bail plea till August 18 (Wednesday), after Justice Yogesh Khanna noted that the status report filed by the Delhi Police in one case was on record while the reports filed in connection with the three other cases were not.Tahir Hussain was booked by the Delhi Police in connection with the communal violence that broke out in the northeastern part of the national capital last year. The cops registered four separate cases at the Dayalpur police station against the former AAP leader and others accused of offenses punishable under Sections 147, 148, 149, 427, 436, and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). In addition to this, Hussain was also named an accused in seven other FIRs filed by the Delhi Police and one complaint relating to money laundering charges being probed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).Tahir Hussain has also filed a petition challenging the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) charges raised against him in connection with the larger conspiracy involving the Delhi riots. The former AAP leader, represented in court by senior advocate Mohit Mathur along with lawyer Rizwan, urged the Delhi HC bench earlier this month to send the petition to the same bench which is already dealing with the bail application of Tahir Hussain.Notably, the Delhi Police had registered more than 750 cases in connection with the northeast Delhi violence, in which at least 53 people were killed and several others were injured. More than 250 charge sheets have also been filed in riot-related cases so far, in which many accused have also been charge-sheeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-riots-hc-to-hear-former-aap-leader-tahir-hussain-s-bail-pleas-today-101629243851969.html

Congress gave me many opportunities as an MP and as president of Mahila Congress too… I believe whatever responsibility was given to me, I worked on it fully. And if there have been some lacunae in my work, I hope its president will forgive me,” she said on Tuesday.Dev also added that while in Congress, Rahul Gandhi gave her ample opportunities to contest elections, to be a national spokesperson, and to be a part of the Mahila Congress. “Not even for a moment, I will be ungrateful for that,” she said.Dev said that joining the TMC will not, in any way, be “counterproductive” towards the goal that the Opposition was looking at in the future. “I have my full faith in Mamata didi. I have joined the TMC without any preconditions because a new relation sustains on trust (not preconditions),” she said.TMC denied that Dev joining the party was in anyway a betrayal to the Congress. “Poaching and breaking political parties not our style. However, always glad to welcome those who are committed to journey with us for a better India,” O’Brien said.Netta D’Souza is new interim Mahila Cong chiefThe Congress on Tuesday appointed Netta D’Souza as the new interim president of its women’s wing Mahila Congress.“The Congress has appointed Netta D’ Souza as the acting president of Mahila Congress with immediate effect till a full-time president is appointed,” Congress general secretary KC Venugopal said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-issues-with-sonia-rahul-joined-tmc-unconditionally-101629244251472.html

18-08-2021||India||Crossing dozens of check posts, relaying messages: Inside India’s evacuation plan in Kabul||As a convoy of 14 vehicles made its way from the Indian embassy in Shar-e-Naw area of Kabul to Hamid Karzai international airport, messages were relayed every minute to senior officials in New Delhi anxiously awaiting updates on the night-time journey by Indian diplomats and citizens through Taliban-controlled districts. The distance between the mission and the airport can usually be covered in about 20 minutes but the convoy with some 150 Indians, escorted by local Afghans known to the embassy staff, took nearly an hour to complete the journey on Monday night because of more than a dozen check posts set up by the Taliban. While the Afghans occupied the lead and last vehicles in the convoy, personnel from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) were present in all the bulletproof cars carrying diplomats and other staff from the mission and a small number of Indian nationals. The threat perception for the convoy was high, especially following reports that “rogue elements” and Pakistani terrorists from groups such as the Lashkar-e-Taiba and the Haqqani Network were present alongside the Taliban in Kabul. As the convoy travelled from Kabul’s “green zone”, the fortified diplomatic quarter with concrete blast walls and checkpoints that till recently housed many foreign missions, and passed key landmarks, messages were relayed to officials at the cabinet secretariat and external affairs ministry who were monitoring the evacuation of the ambassador and other diplomatic staff. Adding to the concerns were reports that the Taliban, who had assumed control of the Afghan capital on Sunday after the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government, had imposed a night curfew in Kabul. Despite these reports, the decision was made to drive to the airport at night because traffic would be thin and it would be easier for the convoy to move relatively faster. Also read: ‘Urgently share details’ - MEA asks Indians still stranded in AfghanistanThe convoy was stopped at a few Taliban check posts, where the local Afghans took care of formalities, and then made its way to the airport. It was only when all the vehicles were safely inside the military side of the airport, under the control of US troops, that officials overseeing the operation in Kabul and New Delhi heaved a sigh of relief. Any Indian nationals who made their way to the embassy were included in the convoy. Ambassador Rudrendra Tandon, speaking to reporters after his return, said, “There are a lot of Indian citizens who found themselves in distress because of the fast-changing situation. So, our policy was that anyone who reached the embassy was taken into the embassy. I don’t know how they managed inside the embassy but we were sure that they were safe and secure and there was an avenue for an exit.” The Indian mission in Kabul had 192 personnel, and everyone was evacuated “literally within three days”, Tandon added. India began planning for the possible withdrawal of its staff more than six months ago after the Taliban launched a major offensive in Afghanistan’s rural areas. Elaborate plans were put in place for all contingencies, with instructions from the top leadership in New Delhi that the security of all Indian personnel was paramount. These plans included “red lines” that would trigger the evacuation of personnel from the embassy and two functional consulates in Kandahar and Mazar-e-Sharif, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. “The red lines included, for example, the capture of key districts near a consulate. The Taliban activity at Spin Boldak was a red line for the Kandahar consulate. The fall of Sheberghan was a red line for Mazar-e-Sharif. We made a call at the right time, and got out at the right time,” said a person. Once the Taliban entered Kabul on Sunday and the security situation became complicated, the decision was made to withdraw the diplomatic staff. However, the move was surrounded in secrecy even as the Indian side coordinated with the US and Afghan partners. One group of about 45 diplomats and security personnel were brought back in a C-17 Globemaster heavy lift aircraft that took off from Hindon airbase late on August 15 and flew back from Kabul the following day. The remaining diplomats and security personnel and some Indian nationals returned on Tuesday in another C-17. The C-17s flew over the Arabian Sea and Iranian airspace to avoid flying over Pakistan. Given the lack of space and chaos at Kabul airport, the C-17s halted at Dushanbe in Tajikistan till it was time for them to hop over to the Afghan capital to pick up their passengers. “The return flight to India was the easy part. The tougher job was getting from the embassy to the airport,” said the person cited above. Without giving details of the evacuation, external affairs minister S Jaishankar tweeted: “Movement of the Indian Ambassador and the Embassy staff from Kabul to India was a difficult and complicated exercise. Thank all those whose cooperation and facilitation made it possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crossing-dozens-of-check-posts-relaying-messages-inside-india-s-evacuation-plan-in-kabul-101629227201383.html
18-08-2021||India||Jaishankar, Blinken discuss Afghanistan||External affairs minister S Jaishankar spoke to US secretary of state Antony Blinken early on Tuesday to seek American assistance in getting Indians evacuated from Kabul, even as a second batch of members of the Indian mission including Ambassador Rudrendra Tandon left the Afghan capital in an Indian Air Force C-17.The first batch of 45 was evacuated on Monday, in another IAF C-17, but the second couldn’t amidst the chaos on the streets of Kabul and in the airport itself.After Turkey backed off from manning the Hamid Karzai International Airport, it is being technically manned by the US forces with air traffic control and perimeter under American security cover.The US secretary of state also assured Jaishankar, who is currently in New York, of full support in future evacuations through civilian flights. Later, on Tuesday, Jaishankar spoke with UNSC members to evolve a broader consensus on the Afghanistan issue. He was also expected to meet with UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres on the same issue. India’s foreign minister is chairing UNSC sessions on terrorism and peacekeeping for two days.Given the chaos in Kabul, EAM Jaishankar is working with the Americans to get the HKI airport ready to receive civilian flights so that Indians and others are evacuated from the strife-torn nation. “ Our priorities are Indians working in Afghanistan, Indians who went to Afghanistan despite our advisory, Indians who were employed by US and European contractors to work in Afghanistan, the civilian population of Indian origin and Afghan friends with traditional links with our country …. E-visas will be issued to those who don’t have documents to travel on application,” said an official who asked not to be named.Before Jaishankar spoke to Blinken, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval also talked to his US counterpart Jake Sullivan on phone to discuss the evacuation of second batch of Indian diplomats and officials from Kabul.The two also discussed ways to stabilise strife torn Afghanistan.The situation in Kabul continues to be precarious with Taliban fighters under no visible chain of command and various sundry terror outfits setting up security check posts to demand protection money. “It is free for all in Kabul with power flowing from the barrel of the gun,” said another official who too asked not to be named.Indian officials managed to get the second batch of evacuees to the HKI airport post-midnight on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-blinken-discuss-afghanistan-101629225978425.html
18-08-2021||India||‘Urgently share details’: MEA asks Indians still stranded in Afghanistan||Using the Air Force’s (IAF) C-17 transport aircraft, India on Monday and Tuesday withdrew its diplomatic staff from Afghanistan, including the Indian ambassador to the war-torn nation Rudrendra Tandon. However, several Indian nationals continue to be stranded in the country that witnessed the re-emergence of the Islamist extremist group Taliban on Sunday and the total collapse of the President Ashraf Ghani-led government.Addressing this matter, the ministry of external affairs on Tuesday requested the stranded Indians in Afghanistan and/or their ‘employers…to urgently share the relevant details with [the ministry’s] Special Afghanistan Cell.”“We understand that a number of Indians are stranded in that country, some of whom are employed by third country organisations. Our immediate priority is to obtain accurate information about all Indian nationals currently in Afghanistan,” the ministry said in a statement.Foreign ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi took to Twitter on Monday to announce that India has created a special Afghanistan cell to look into the issues pertaining to the repatriation of Indian nationals and other matters in Afghanistan. This development came after it was reported that several Sikh and Hindu Indian citizens have taken refuge at a gurdwara in Kabul, even as the panic-stricken Afghans resorted to every possible method to escape their home country.Also Read | India sets up Afghanistan cell to coordinate repatriation as Sikhs, Hindus huddle in Kabul gurdwaraUnion external affairs minister S Jaishankar, meanwhile, described the evacuation of the Indian embassy from Afghanistan to be a “difficult and complicated exercise.”"Movement of the Indian Ambassador and the embassy staff from Kabul to India was a difficult and complicated exercise.

Following his appeal, Union cabinet minister Hardeep Singh Puri said that the MEA and all other concerned government departments would make all arrangements to bring back Indians from Afghanistan.The Taliban entered Kabul on Sunday facing minimal or no resistance from the US-backed Afghan troops.

18-08-2021||India||Chhattisgarh issues notice to news portal over report citing minister||RAIPUR: Even as rumblings of a power struggle within the Chhattisgarh Congress continue over a reported power-sharing arrangement between chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and health minister TS Singh Deo, the latter has written to the state public relations department asking for action against a news portal that carried a report saying Baghel would resign on August 17 and attributed it to him.In the letter written to the department on Monday, Singh Deo called the piece a “planned conspiracy” to “pollute” the political environment of the state. CM Baghel heads the department of public relations. The report carried by portal TPC 24, said, “TS Singh Deo ka daava 17 ko mukhyamantri denge isteefa, idhar dabaav se beparvaah lambi paari khelne ke andaaz mein , le rahe hain kayee bade faisle…” (TS Singh Deo claimed CM will resign on 17, but CM instead of the pressure is taking big decisions). In response, the public relations department on Tuesday sent a notice to the portal citing Singh Deo’s contention and asking them to file a corrigendum or face legal action, an official said. Editor of TPC-24, Mahendra Sahu, however, said he has not received any notice from the public relations department so far. “We will give proper reply to the notice after we get it from a proper channel,” said Sahu. This is the latest in a series of developments that underline the fraught political atmosphere within the Congress, emanating from a reported power-sharing agreement between Baghel and Singh Deo after the party swept to power in December 2019. On June 17, the day when the Congress government completed two and a half years, Singh Deo called Baghel on the phone, congratulated for his term, and then reminded him about the post-sharing formula as well, people familiar with the matters said. In response to the near constant speculation, both leaders have taken the stance that decisions will be taken by the high command, and they will follow the instructions from Delhi. However, two months since June 17, Singh Deo is in Delhi apparently to meet the top Congress leaders seeking clarity on the post-sharing formula. When asked about his purpose of Delhi trip, Singh Deo told HT, “I don’t want to politicise my visit.” He further said that earlier this month, he was in Delhi for a health check-up and had stopped in the national capital while returning from Tripura, where he was sent by the party high command. On July 27, the differences within the party came on the fore when Singh Deo walked out of the state assembly demanding clarity from his own government over allegations that the minister’s relative was involved in an alleged attack on Congress legislator Brihaspat Singh. The issue began after Singh alleged that his convoy was attacked at the behest of Singh Deo in Surguja district, which is the health minister’s assembly constituency. Later, after the intervention of party’s state in-charge PL Punia, the issue was resolved, and Singh Deo returned to assembly after Singh apologised for his statements against the minister. Some within the party believe Singh Deo was also continuously ignored in some of the important meetings during Covid-19 pandemic despite him being the health minister, in the last 16 months, which further escalated tension between the two leaders. Last week, assembly speaker and senior Congress leader Charan Das Mahant, who was also seen as in the running for CM in 2018, added to the speculation when he told reporters that four senior leaders – Baghel, Singh Deo, home minister Tamradhwaj Sahu and himself – had played the semifinals for the CM post, and the final was in progress. “Semifinals were between four people, and only two remained. But one who wins the finals is eventually the winner. Rahul ji ( Rahul Gandhi) knows all about this formula and only Delhi can give more information about it,” Mahant added. The main opposition Bhartiya Janata Party claimed the issue of power-sharing between two leaders should be resolved for the benefit of the state. It, however, trained its guns on the Congress, and said the animosity was harming the state. “Although, the tiff is an internal issue of Congress, but as per the statements of party leaders, it seems that there was a formula for CM post-sharing. The senior leaders of Congress should resolve the issue as soon as possible. Secondly, the people of the state are suffering from this struggle. We all know that Singh Deo, who is also the health minister of the state, was ignored in important meetings of cabinet due to which people suffered,” said former CM and BJP vice-president Raman Singh. Political commentators in the state believe the Congress and its workers are hoping to see the issue resolved with a sense of finality. Parivesh Mishra, a political commentator in the state, said, “Any situation that forces the Congress worker to take sides is generally not acceptable. Except for a handful of those who aspire for office and stand a serious chance of achieving it, there is nothing at stake for the ordinary party worker at the ground level. The vast majority of the party workers would like to see the present controversy over as soon as possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-issues-notice-to-news-portal-over-report-citing-minister-101629225881574.html
18-08-2021||India||Action against Opposition MPs for ruckus in RS unlikely soon||Punitive action being sought by the government against opposition MPs accused of creating pandemonium in the Rajya Sabha on August 11 could be some time away (if at all) not just on account of the lengthy process involved, but also because the final step requires the House to be in session.One Rajya Sabha official familiar with the matter said Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu has to go through the allegations carefully, consult experts and take legal opinion before he decides whether there is need to set up a panel that will, in turn, recommend the action that needs to be taken against the lawmakers.“But as any action against lawmakers has to be taken through a motion (proposal) in the Rajya Sabha to get the nod of the House, it can only happen during the next session,” said former Lok Sabha secretary general P Sreedharan.Naidu has started seeking legal consultation on possible action that can be taken against opposition MPs who allegedly disrupted House proceedings, damaged property and manhandled marshals on the last day of the monsoon session.If there’s prima facie proof of unruly conduct and other allegations of violence, the Rajya Sabha secretariat might set up a panel. The secretariat clarified that steps can be taken against a member even after the session is over. “The monsoon session might have ended, but the lawmakers continue to be a member of the House,” explained a top functionary who asked not to be named.Naidu, however, is personally averse to taking the extreme step of suspending members for the remainder of their terms in the House.On August 15, a delegation of seven ministers led by Leader of the House Piyush Goyal met Naidu and requested action against the members for what they called unprecedented, extreme and violent acts in the House. The government has already requested him to take exemplary action against lawmakers who were seen climbing tables in the Upper House, ripping papers, throwing the rule book and damaging property.The Rajya Sabha secretariat has further reported to Naidu that some Opposition leaders “threatened” deputy chairman Harivansh and even used “abusive language” while doing so.Fierce protests erupted in the Upper House on the last day of the monsoon session of parliament as the government tried to clear the general insurance amendment bill even as a section of the opposition opposed it, claiming it required scrutiny by a select committee.Amid speculation that some of the allies and friendly parties could also send a written complaint to the Rajya Sabha chairperson, a senior leader of the BJP said, “Some MPs had indicated that they could approach the Rajya Sabha chairperson to take action against the disruptions because it had also prevented them from raising issues in the house and obstructed their functioning...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/action-against-opposition-mps-for-ruckus-in-rs-unlikely-soon-101629225699711.html
18-08-2021||India||Daily shots hit record as case slide continues||With over 8.8 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines administered on Monday, India set a new record for the highest ever number of single-day vaccinations since the start of the drive on January 16, the Union health ministry said, even as national daily infections have again started dropping with the outbreak beginning to contract in the state of Kerala, the most recent infection hotspot.The central government attributed the increase in the pace of daily vaccination to the availability of shots, “advance visibility of supply” to states and Union territories which enabled them to plan better, as well as the “streamlining” of the overall supply chain.According to government data, 560 million doses have been administered to 435 million people across India till Tuesday evening. This translates to over 46% of all adults in the country having been administered at least one dose of the vaccine – 33% of India’s adults have been partially vaccinated, while another 13.3% have received both shots of the vaccine, data shows.On Monday, 8.8 million doses were administered across the country – the highest ever, according to government data. To be sure, this occurred a day after daily vaccinations dropped to just 2 million on Sunday. The drop on Sunday, however, was expected as vaccination numbers generally drop over weekends and holidays (Sunday was also Independence Day).“88 lakh India achieves the highest single-day record in #COVID19 vaccine doses. Yesterday will go down in the history of the world’s #LargestVaccineDrive. Congratulations [India],” tweeted Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya.The previous record for single-day doses was set on June 21 when around 8.6 million jabs were administered after the new phase of universalisation of Covid-19 vaccination commenced.To be sure, the seven-day average of daily dose administration still remains patchy. The current rate, despite Monday’s record numbers, remains much below peak capacity exhibited in the past – 5.7 million daily doses have been administered on average in the last seven days against a peak of 6.3 million daily doses for the week ended June 26, data shows. However, that this number is rising again is a good sign.Health ministry officials said they expect a further increase in inoculation rates in the coming weeks.“With vaccine supplies and logistical arrangements gradually improving, the daily numbers are going to go further up. It was expected. We have the capacity and capability to do more in a single day and it will see further increase in coming weeks,” a government official aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity.This rise in vaccinations is particularly significant as it comes at a time when cases have again started dropping. The seven-day average of new infections, which denotes a region’s Covid-19 case curve, has now dropped to 36,126 cases a day for the week ending August 16 – the lowest this has touched in the country since March 20, or in 149 days. At its peak during India’s brutal second wave, this number soared to 391,819 cases a day for the week ending May 9, according to HT’s dashboard.For two-and-a-half months after the May 9 peak, India’s Covid curve was witnessing a near-steady drop which was briefly halted in the last week of July by an abrupt rise of infections in Kerala. For the week ended July 25, average daily cases in India dropped to 38,007, but this number started rising and touched 40,817 for the week ended August 1 – a rise that was pushed almost entirely by numbers from Kerala, which still accounts for more than half of all new infections in the country.These findings were echoed in the epidemiological estimates conducted by epiforecasts.io, a website that assesses temporal variations in transmission in different countries, that showed that India’s overall effective reproduction number (Rt) has dropped to 0.92. An Rt of more than 1 means an outbreak is expanding in a region, while that below 1 denotes a contraction. Kerala had an Rt of 0.95.Government experts said an increase in vaccination rate may improve the chances of the country being able to avert a potential third Covid wave.“It depends on how many of our people are protected, and how many have been exposed to the virus. The vaccination drive is successfully progressing and we are hopeful that will soon be able to immunise a majority of our population that will be a big factor in determining that we don’t see a third wave. Also, even if we see a third wave, it is a small one,” Dr Himanshu Chauhan, joint director, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), said in a video statement.Independent experts, however, stressed that vaccination may not immediately help in pandemic control but would prove beneficial in the long run.“Our expectations of pandemic control require revision and I don’t think we have done the distinction between healthcare expectation and public health expectation. The healthcare piece will be affected more by vaccination than pandemic control as defined by how we currently use indicators,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of country’s top vaccinologist from Christian Medical College, Vellore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/daily-shots-hit-record-as-case-slide-continues-101629225338505.html
18-08-2021||India||Govt cites national security, SC issues notice on Pegasus||The Union government told the Supreme Court it has nothing to add to its affidavit on the Pegasus snooping matter filed on Monday that neither confirmed nor denied the use of the spyware to hack phones of ministers, politicians, businessmen, activists and journalists, following which the bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, issued a formal notice to it on a clutch of petitions demanding a court-monitored independent investigation into the issue.The court observed that it is “not averse” to the creation of an expert committee to look into the alleged surveillance of Indian citizens using the Israeli spyware – as suggested by the government – but that it expected the Union government to bring sufficient facts on record regarding the interception regime in India.The government, however, maintained that any disclosure on its using or not using Pegasus spyware could affect national security, and reaffirmed its stand of divulging such information only to the proposed committee which, it added, can report to the top court.In line with its response a day ago, the government said that all interceptions were being done in accordance with the statutory procedure and it would not wish to put out in public domain details of software used for lawful surveillance by filing any additional affidavit.On Monday, the government filed a three-page affidavit offering to set up an expert committee to look into all aspects of the controversy and “dispel any wrong narrative spread by certain vested interests”. It further contended that the petitions “are based on conjectures and surmises or on other unsubstantiated media reports or incomplete or uncorroborated material” and, hence, failed to make out any case to invoke writ jurisdiction.The bench, which included justices Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose, asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta to reconsider filing a detailed reply in 10 days while observing that the court will ponder over the future course of action in the meantime.“We are not averse to a fact-finding or investigating committee...We will issue notice and then we will take a call on whether a committee is to be appointed -- whether it is to be a committee of||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-cites-national-security-sc-issues-notice-on-pegasus-101629225279759.html

However, the police denied Thakur’s charge.“I came to offer puja and was arrested by the police,” the Union minister of state for ports, shipping and waterways said.However, the police denied the charge. “Cars were kept at the airport for Thakur since he is a Union minister. BJP workers started a snap demonstration and we had to stop them. Thakur forcefully boarded the bus in which the BJP workers were being taken away... He was not arrested,” an officer of the airport police station said.The BJP has alleged that 36 of its workers have been killed in Bengal since the assembly poll results were announced on May 2. The state government has told the Calcutta high court - which asked the NHRC to probe the allegations of post-poll violence - that the report is biased and prepared with a political motive.“The BJP has no base in Bengal. Why will the police arrest a Union minister? This is a lie...,” said Trinamool Congress Lok Sabha MP Saugata Roy.Meanwhile, police said it arrested over 30 BJP workers in various districts across the state for violating Covid-19 restrictions, but later released them.However, Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said, “The TMC government was informed in advance that our programme would be held in compliance with Covid curbs and yet our workers and leaders were arrested.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shahid-samman-yatra-mos-alleges-arrest-in-bengal-police-deny-101629225218528.html

For more than a month, Kerala has been contributing half of the total cases in the country. This is nothing but gross mismanagement. It is reduced to a model of mismanagement,” he said, chiding the oft-repeated “Kerala model of development” by the left leaders.The BJP president also criticised the low testing rate and vaccination programme being hijacked by local CPI (M) leaders. “In the state, more than half of tests are still antigen. The real mode is RT-PCR. It ignored repeated warnings of experts and failed to raise its test rate. The state also ignored some of the proactive steps taken by the Union government,” he said, adding that the Centre was willing to help the state always. He cited the special scheme worth ₹267 crores announced by Union health minister M Mandaviya upon his visit to the state on Monday.“The government still finds refuge in some of its old records. It needs a sincere and pragmatic approach to come out of the present crisis. You can’t play politics everywhere,” he said, alleging that in some areas left workers hijacked the vaccination programme. He said like the left parties, the BJP never wanted to play politics during the pandemic.The CPI (M) is yet to react on the matter.Meanwhile, the state reported another surge in Covid-19 cases, reporting 21,613 cases with a test positivity rate of 15. 48 per cent after 139,623 samples were tested.

But in the course of one dramatic week, the futures of Afghan students in India, has become one of uncertainty and fear, and worry for what lies ahead. On Monday, 28-year-old Diana Farzan, a student in Bengaluru spoke to her family in Herat for all of five minutes. She wanted to check on her parents and her family, but had another question at the top of her mind, if she would be allowed to work. “I’m doing my masters in journalism because I want to pursue a career as a journalist or get back to teaching journalism. I don’t know what will happen now and what I will I do when I got back home. Sit at home as they (Taliban) wants, in a country where I don’t have the right to vote? I don’t want to do that,” said Farzan. But if Farzan has two more semesters left in India, for another student at Bangalore University, the concern is more immediate. An Afghan student, who ordinarily would have to return at the end of the academic session said that under the Taliban, Afghanistan would move backwards in time. “I don’t know what I must do...From what we have heard, Taliban rule was a time when a woman didn’t matter. I don’t want that. I will see how things are by the time my course is over,” said the Bangalore University student, who didn’t want to be named. Ever since the Taliban marched to Kabul, in Odisha’s Rourkela, a 23 year-old civil engineering student has been making frantic calls to his family, but despite a short conversation, has had no solace. His father, who works with the Afghan Election Commission and the family have locked themselves inside their home, despite a food shortage. “Our house is in the sururbs of Kabul. But no one is sure what is going to happen as we have seen how Taliban have tortured people over last two decades,” said the student who did not want to be named.The 23-year-old is among the 14 Afghanistan students sponsored by ICCR for scholarships in Odisha, and hoped that once he finished his degree, he would join the “reconstruction” of his country. “But now returning home seems to be dangerous forget working in Afghanistan.” Another 23 year-old student, Ehsanullah, who joined Utkal University in Bhubaneswar earlier this year, said that the Taliban had actually entered and searched his home, but thus far had done no harm. “My father retired from government job earlier this year and all my five brothers were employed in various wings of the Afghanistan government. Last week, my father’s pension and retirement benefits were cancelled, and brothers lost their jobs,” he said.For many, the worry is that the very act of choosing to study abroad, or what they are studying, may be enough for them to be considered a “traitor” under the Taliban regime. Ibrahim Akbari, a student at Goa University said. “Things may be okay now but they will soon be coming door to door. My family’s life is in danger if they know that I am studying here. If I go back I will definitely be killed especially if they know that I am studying political science,” Akbari told HT. Akbari said that a pressing concern now is the need for funds, particularly for those students that aren’t on scholarships. “Many have been funded by their parents back home who are now unsure of their financial situation and therefore cannot send more money here. Others have rent to pay.” In Uttarakhand, Hashmi, a PHD student from Kabul, one of the four Afghans studying at Pantnagar University under the Indo-Afghan joint fellowship programme, has a visa that expires in two weeks. “My visa terminates on August 30 and I wanted to return to Afghanistan as my research here is done. But the present turmoil makes that very uncertain. But here, I will face the problem of how I will remain without a visa if it is not extended”, he said. Brijesh Singh, Dean, student welfare in Pant varsity said that the University would stand with its Afghan students and take care of them on “humanitarian grounds.” “The matter is in the notice of the vice-chancellor. Since it is a policy matter, we will follow the instructions of the Central government in this regard.” With inputs from Gerard D Souza in Panaji and Mohan Raj in Dehradun||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fear-uncertainty-haunt-afghan-students-in-india-101629224618420.html
18-08-2021||India||Can’t continue extending ED chief’s term indefinitely: SC||The government cannot continue extending the tenure of the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) chief till the agency completes investigating all crucial cases, observed the Supreme Court on Tuesday after being told that the success achieved in crucial money laundering cases under the present ED director was one of the reasons to extend his tenure by a year.The court was hearing arguments on a petition filed by NGO Common Cause which has challenged the November 13, 2020 decision of the Government granting Enforcement Director Sanjay Kumar Mishra an extension till November 18, 2021. By an order of November 19, 2018, his tenure was fixed for two years. With just days remaining for the end of his tenure in November 2020, the Government retrospectively modified his tenure to three years in the original appointment order.Mishra reached his retirement age in May 2020.Hearing arguments on the petition, the bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai set out to examine whether the decision to grant three-year tenure was contrary to the 1997 judgment of the Supreme Court laying down a minimum tenure of two years for the heads of ED and Central Bureau of Investigation. The bench also considered whether an extension granted post-retirement would go against Rule 56 of the All India Service Rules which mandates that all government servants retire at 60.Appearing for the Government, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said that the Central Vigilance Commission Act was enacted in 2003 and the court’s 1997 decision was incorporated in Section 25(d) which said, “Notwithstanding anything contained in the Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999 or any other law for the time being in force….a Director of Enforcement shall continue to hold office for a period of not less than two years from the date on which he assumes office.”He pointed out that while the 1997 judgment provided for a minimum tenure, it did not weigh in on tenure beyond two years. Mehta also added that Section 25(d) of the CVC Act overrides Rule 56.The appointment was not “haphazard” or based on “whims and fancies of the Government” as projected by the petitioner, Mehta said, adding that a committee headed by the Central Vigilance Commissioner examined Mishra’s professional record of past 10 years before recommending his extension.“In the last two years (as Director), apart from investigating crucial money laundering cases, a sum of nearly ₹9,000 crore worth proceeds of crime stood deposited in the investigation of three cases involving Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi,” the Solicitor General said.The bench replied, “We appreciate that he is doing good work. But you cannot continue with him till all these cases are over. The task of Enforcement Directorate is very important. You cannot leave it to one individual to complete it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cant-continue-extending-ed-chief-s-term-indefinitely-sc-101629223959169.html
18-08-2021||India||Web portals to offer geospatial data||The Union government on Tuesday launched web portals to offer the geospatial data collected by the Survey of India and the National Atlas and Thematic Mapping Organization either free or at a nominal cost.The launch comes nearly six months after the government announced liberalisation of collection and dissemination of geospatial data, in February, allowing private companies to conduct surveying and mapping without government approvals, and to share data for various applications — from logistics and transport to road safety and e-commerce. Under the policy, geospatial data from government agencies such as the Survey of India and the Indian Space Research Organisation was to be made available to public.“The new geospatial policy launched erased all the regulations on surveying and mapping, thus removing a lot of cobwebs of the past in one sweep. By liberalising and democratising geospatial data, a direct impact of about 1 lakh crore will be created by 2030,” said professor Ashutosh Sharma, secretary, department of science and technology.ISRO’s satellite-based navigation data is already available for use by citizens free-to-air; the space agency’s new policy states that it will work on making the data interoperable with other navigation signals such as GPS and GLONASS to increase acceptance and better navigation signals for people in India subcontinent.The department of science also announced that India will be hosting the second United Nations World Geospatial Information Congress (UNWGIC) in Hyderabad in October 2022. “We are excited to host UNWGIC next year and looking forward to welcome all in Hyderabad next year for the event which would show a glimpse of India’s evolving geospatial ecosystem,” said Sharma.The online maps portal of Survey of India has over 4,000 maps with national, state, district, and tehsil level data that have been indexed for end users. The portal also lists various formats the information can be downloaded in. Online payment is enabled on the portal for easy payment. The prices of the maps range from ₹0 to ₹68,750, according to the portal.“With the launch of this online portal, the users will no longer have to visit the SOI offices, and they can easily purchase and download products online at their doorstep through Bharat Kosh payment gateway of Govt of India,” said the Surveyor General of India Naveen Tomar.In addition to that, the Survey of India has also developed a web geographic information system (GIS) called Sarthi that will help users in creating applications for geospatial data visualisation, manipulation, and analysis without a lot of resources at their end. A GIS connects location data to layers of other information such as where health facilities are located, type of vegetation found in a region, or water resources in the area. “The portal will allow a company or say the Maharashtra government to create an application with different types of geographical data instead of investing resources in creating such application on their own from the geospatial data available,” said Sunil Kumar, joint secretary, department of science.The third portal, called Manchitran, makes available thematic maps developed by NATMO. “NATMO works on creating various thematic maps such as the cultural map of India, the climactic map, or the economic map,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/web-portals-to-offer-geospatial-data-101629223838050.html
18-08-2021||India||National force for judges unfeasible, Centre tells SC||The Supreme Court on Tuesday expressed distress over rising incidents of physical and verbal attacks on judges throughout the country, even as the Union government maintained that there is no need to have a national-level security force to protect judges and court precincts.A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, was informed by the government that constituting a dedicated unit nationally for the protection of judges is “neither advisable nor practical”.The bench, which also included justices Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose, was taking stock of the safety measures put in place and those being contemplated by the Centre and states for the protection of judges in the wake of the death of additional district and sessions judge Uttam Anand, who was fatally knocked down by a vehicle on July 28 in Jharkhand’s Dhanbad.A 2019 public interest litigation, filed by Karunakar Mahalik for a specialised force for security to all courts, judges, lawyers, litigants and witnesses in the country, was heard along with the case registered by the court suo motu (on its own motion) over the death of the Dhanbad judge. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, told the bench that there are guidelines issued by the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) to all the states and Union Territories in 2007 and reiterated in 2020 for creating special units within the state police forces.“Public order and police are state subjects. The central government has already provided a broad mechanism. If the states were to adhere to the MHA guidelines in letter and spirit, much of the problems will be resolved. The security has to be state-specific. From coordination to efficacy, it is more advisable that states have special units. States have their own peculiar problems and they can deal with the specific issues relating to the safety of judges by having their own modules,” said the SG.The bench, however, pointed out that the issues are not with the guidelines but with their implementation. “Guidelines are fine but the question is whether these guidelines are followed or not, and if yes, to what extent. The Supreme Court has to bear the burden to see your guidelines are implemented. You are the central government. You can call their secretaries, DGPs and supervise the implementation,” it told Mehta.The court observed that the central government “is in the best position to ensure implementation of its guidelines” after resolving issues relating to funds, installation of CCTV cameras, manner of implementation, etc., with the state governments.“You have to think how things have to be effectively done... You have to take this forward with the states,” it told Mehta.The court also took umbrage at the failure of various states in not filing their reply affidavits to Mahalik’s petition despite the passage of more than a year and imposed a penalty of ₹1 lakh each on such defaulting states. These included Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Meghalaya and Mizoram. The bench clarified that it would be compelled to seek the presence of the chief secretaries of the states concerned if they fail to file affidavits within 10 days.About the states which filed their affidavits, the bench remarked: “We are very sorry to say that all states have tried to paint a rosy picture but the truth is that incidents are repeatedly occurring despite all the statements. That is why we want the SG to step in. We want the central government to ensure the safety of judicial officers.”The court underlined that some concrete steps are required to prevent the crimes. “States cannot make the excuse that they do not have funds. That is something for the Centre and states to resolve among themselves,” it said while asking Mehta what steps the Centre is willing to take.At this, the SG said that he would speak with the Union home secretary for calling a meeting with state home secretaries and directors general of police (DGPs) of all the states to discuss the extent of their implementation of the MHA guidelines and the roadblocks therein.The court then adjourned the matter for 10 days to await replies from the remaining states as well as the outcome of the meeting of the Union home secretary.The court had on July 30 registered a PIL on its own over Anand’s death in suspicious circumstances, emphasising that it is the state’s obligation to protect judges to ensure they can discharge their duties fearlessly.A day later, the Jharkhand government recommended a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-force-for-judges-unfeasible-centre-tells-sc-101629222819860.html
18-08-2021||India||Solar scam: CBI begins probe against Chandy, other leaders||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday took over the probe into allegations of sexual exploitation against former Kerala chief minister Oommen Chandy, former Union minister (of state) KC Venugopal, and others by the woman accused in the 2013 solar fraud case.Confirming the development, a CBI official in Delhi said the central agency has taken over six FIRs filed by the state crime branch and filed FIRs in the chief judicial magistrate’s court in Thiruvananthapuram.In 2018, the state crime branch registered cases against several senior Congress leaders after Saritha S Nair, an accused in the solar fraud case that happened when the UDF government was in power, accused them of sexually exploiting her in 2012. In her complaint in 2016, Nair alleged that she was subjected to sexual abuse by the accused in return for favours granted to her.Besides Chandy and AICC general secretary (organisation) Venugopal, MPs Hibi Eden and Adoor Prakash, former state minister A P Anil Kumar and BJP national vice-president AP Abdullakutty was also named in the cases. Kutty was in Congress when the allegations against him surfaced but later joined the BJP.The CPI(M)-led Kerala government formed a judicial commission and handed over the cases to the central agency in January. While Chandy welcomed CBI’s investigation, others called it “part of a witch-hunt to discredit them.” “I don’t have anything to hide. Let any agency probe it, I welcome it,” Chandy said. Eden, the MP from Kochi, said the CBI probe was a part of a sinister plan to discredit Congress leaders and that he will deal with the case legally. The CPI(M) said it was a routine affair as the case was handed over to the agency in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/solar-scam-cbi-begins-probe-into-sexual-exploitation-allegations-against-chandy-others-101629222581436.html
18-08-2021||India||India introduces emergency e-visas for Afghan nationals amid crisis||India on Tuesday introduced a new category of emergency electronic visas (e-visas) for Afghan nationals in view of the situation in Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover, with priority to be given to those who stood by India or are facing threats.All Afghans, irrespective of religion, will be eligible for the “e-Emergency X-Misc Visa” and applications will be processed in New Delhi since all Indian missions in Afghanistan are currently not operational, according to people familiar with matter. The visas will be valid for only six months for now, they said.“The ministry of home affairs reviews visa provisions in view of the current situation in Afghanistan. A new category of electronic visa called ‘e-Emergency X-Misc Visa’ introduced to fast-track visa applications for entry into India,” a home ministry spokesperson said in a tweet.The Indian government decided to provide visas to Afghan nationals keeping their “security in mind”, the people cited above said.“Those who wish to travel to India can apply for this visa online following which applications will be examined and processed in New Delhi,” said a government official who didn’t wish to be named.The development came two days after the government in Afghanistan collapsed, with President Ashraf Ghani fleeing and the Taliban entering the capital unopposed. Even before the Taliban takeover, the Indian mission in Kabul had been swamped by requests for visas.The people cited above said a policy decision was made nearly six months ago to help Afghans facing threats after the country was hit by a wave of targeted assassinations of officials and journalists. A decision was made recently to introduce the e-visa as it would be easier and more secure for Afghans to apply online. An elaborate system, involving the home ministry, is in place for vetting all applications, which must be accompanied by certain documents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-introduces-emergency-e-visas-for-afghan-nationals-amid-crisis-101629219039733.html

The oxygen concentrator works at a flow rate of 10 litres per minute (LPM) with an oxygen purity of 92% ±3. The concentrator has an adjustable capacity of 1 to 10 LPM which can be used for both medical as well as personal uses.The concentrator has been developed by a team involving professor J Ramkumar from the department of mechanical engineering; Siddhanth Srivastava, a PhD scholar, and Rupendra Aryal, an M Tech student. The advanced oxygen concentrator has been developed to maintain an adequate supply of oxygen, said IIT Kanpur director professor Abhay Karandikar.The memorandum of understanding (MoU) exchange ceremony, which took place virtually on Tuesday, began with a brief introduction from professor Abhay Karandikar, director, IIT-K, and Akash Singh, CEO of Albot Technologies. The ceremony was also joined by professor Amitabha Bandyopadhyay, professor AR Harish and Ravi Pandey from IIT Kanpur.Professor Amitabha Bandyopadhyay, in-charge of innovation at IIT Kanpur, said the incubator of IIT Kanpur was actively working with several stakeholders, including Yamuna expressway development authority and some international partners, for expediting the medical device development ecosystem in the country.Director, IIT Kanpur, professor Abhay Karandikar also apprised about the ongoing progress of the School of Medical Research and Technology at IIT Kanpur which will have a 400-bed hospital on the campus. He emphasised that the R&D activity of the school will promote research leading to the development of innovative and cost-effective medical devices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iit-kanpur-develops-sanjeevani-oxygen-concentrator-101629216817396.html
18-08-2021||India||Blood clotting may be root cause of long Covid syndrome? Here's what study says||Patients with long Covid syndrome continue to have higher measures of blood clotting, which may explain their persistent symptoms such as reduced physical fitness and fatigue, according to a study.The symptoms of long Covid syndrome, including breathlessness, fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance, can last weeks to months after the initial infection has resolved, and is estimated to affect millions of people worldwide.The researchers from RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences in Ireland examined 50 patients with symptoms of long Covid syndrome to better understand if abnormal blood clotting is involved.Their study, published in the Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, found that clotting markers were significantly elevated in the blood of patients with long Covid syndrome compared with healthy controls.These clotting markers were higher in patients who required hospitalisation with their initial Covid-19 infection.However, the researchers also found that even those who were able to manage their illness at home still had persistently high clotting markers.They observed that higher clotting was directly related to other symptoms of long Covid syndrome, such as reduced physical fitness and fatigue.Even though markers of inflammation had all returned to normal levels, increased clotting potential was still present in long Covid patients."Because clotting markers were elevated while inflammation markers had returned to normal, our results suggest that the clotting system may be involved in the root cause of long Covid syndrome," said Helen Fogarty, the study's lead author, and PhD student at RCSI School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences.Professor James O'Donnell, Director of the Irish Centre for Vascular Biology, RCSI noted that understanding the root cause of a disease is the first step towards developing effective treatments."Millions of people are already dealing with the symptoms of long Covid syndrome, and more people will develop long Covid as the infections among the unvaccinated continue to occur," O'Donnell said."It is imperative that we continue to study this condition and develop effective treatments," he added.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

18-08-2021||India||ED issues fresh summons to Anil Deshmukh in extortion and money laundering case||A day after the Supreme Court refused to grant any interim relief to former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh and his son Hrishikesh in a corruption-cum-extortion probe, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) asked him to appear at the agency’s South Mumbai office on Wednesday. This is the fifth summons issued to the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader.ED registered a money laundering case against Deshmukh after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed an FIR against him on April 21 following former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh’s allegation—levelled in March this year—that Deshmukh had directed a police officer to extort ₹100 crore a month from Mumbai’s hotels and bars. Deshmukh has denied all allegations against him multiple times.The ED has claimed that its probe suggests that Deshmukh misused his position as Maharashtra home minister, and through assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze—who has now been dismissed and is in Taloja jail for his alleged role in the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran murder cases—collected ₹4.7 crore from Mumbai’s bars for their “smooth functioning”.The agency adds that this money was later, through hawala channels, sent to two brothers in Delhi who operated bogus companies and later diverted the money as donations to Nagpur-based Shri Sai Shikshan Sansthan, an educational trust controlled by the Deshmukhs.ED has also claimed that while collecting money from the bar owners, Sachin Vaze told them that a part of the amount was to go to an entity—‘No 1’—as well as the crime and social service branches of the Mumbai Police.The anti-money laundering agency has also said that Vaze told ED that he was called to Deshmukh’s official residence and directed to collect ₹3 lakh from every bar and restaurant in the city. He was also given a list of the establishments.ED claims to have identified 24 private entities that are controlled by the Deshmukh family and says they made huge monetary transactions without much rationale.“From the analysis of the bank accounts of these companies, it is clear that there is no rationale for the transfers, and thus it can be said that these series of transactions were meant for inflating balance sheets and layering of money from one company to other,” ED had stated.The agency then arrested Deshmukh’s personal secretary Sanjeev Palande and assistant Kundan Shinde on June 26, claiming their role in laundering of money on Deshmukh’s directions.In mid-July, the anti-money laundering agency provisionally attached Deshmukh’s properties worth ₹4.2 crore. The attached assets include a residential flat in Worli valued at ₹1.54 crore and 25 land parcels of book value ₹2.67 crore at Dhutum village at Uran in the neighbouring Raigad district.ED said its investigation has revealed that the Worli flat was purchased by the NCP leader in 2004 by making cash payment. It was registered in the name of Deshmukh’s wife Aarti, but the sale deed for the flat was registered in February 2020 after he became the home minister.The other seized properties, too, are held in Aarti’s name as well as in the name of Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd. According to ED officers, the Deshmukhs acquired 50% ownership in M/s Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd, including its assets (land and shops) valued around ₹5.34 crore (book value) by merely paying ₹17.95 lakh, that too after a substantial gap.Deshmukh has, however, maintained that the case against him was a classic example of a political witch hunt. He has said that the allegations levelled by former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh cropped up only after the cop was shunted out over his poor handling of the Antilia and the Hiran murder cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-issues-fresh-summons-to-anil-deshmukh-in-extortion-and-money-laundering-case-101629192514101.html
18-08-2021||Today's||From a pandemic to an endemic, India’s vaccine drive enables a way out||A week from now, maybe a day or so sooner, maybe a day or so later, India will reach a magic number in terms of vaccinations: 470 million people would have received at least one shot of vaccines that prevent death and serious illness from Covid-19.That number, 50% of all adults (those over the age of 18 years) in the country, is significant for several reasons. The most important one, I believe, is that it marks the first major marker or milestone in the transformation of the coronavirus disease pandemic into an endemic.Not everyone agrees. After all, at the milestone, a maximum of 15% of India’s adult population is likely to have received both shots of the vaccine, and data shows that people need to be fully vaccinated to prevent serious illness and death when it comes to the Delta strain of the Sars-CoV-2 virus. There is no arguing with that research — even if countries currently seeing waves on account of the Delta variant were not ravaged by it, much like India was, in April and May.But it would still be extremely short-sighted to not recognise the 470-million-with-at-least-one-shot number for what it is. It is a way out, the beginning of the end, and it comes not a moment too soon.As I write this, the seven-day average of daily new Covid-19 cases in India has touched a 149-day low. There is enough reason to remain vigilant — the surge that Kerala witnessed, presumably caused by the Delta variant (we don’t know for sure because we haven’t sequenced enough genomes) can happen in some other parts of the country; and Maharashtra is already beginning to see an increase in infections caused by the Delta-plus variant. But there is also enough reason for everyone to start planning for what will likely be.That simply involves understanding the meaning of the transformation of Covid-19 from a pandemic to an endemic. This has implications for national, state and local policymakers, administrators and public health workers. And it has implications for how we work, learn, travel, and play.Mathematically, it simply means understanding that while there is going to be the constant presence of the virus that causes the coronavirus disease, this needs to be treated as a baseline (or usual prevalence of the virus). Seen that way, it immediately becomes clear that there has to be a shift in response in terms of both management and behaviour.Is it too soon to start treating Covid-19 as an endemic disease? Perhaps, but it is definitely not too soon to start planning what its eventual, inevitable, and imminent transformation to an endemic means. There is still the question of people under the age of 18, but the immediate focus needs to be those in the 12-18 age group (there are 145 million people in this segment). As for younger children, there is nothing to suggest that they are any more vulnerable to serious illness and death than they were during the first wave of the disease (very low). There is also enough research to show that a high proportion of fully vaccinated adults helps reduce even asymptomatic infections among young people who are not vaccinated.There is also the question of booster shots. But at this time, the only people who should even be considered for this in India are the most vulnerable (and there is enough medical science to identify them, starting with those who have had organ transplants).Those managing India’s vaccine drive have always been a step or two behind the curve. But a reading of the infection and vaccination trajectories indicates that they need to start planning now for a future of endemic Covid-19.letters@hindustantimes.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/from-a-pandemic-to-an-endemic-india-s-vaccine-drive-enables-a-way-out-101629297940201.html
18-08-2021||Today's||India has an unemployment crisis. And it predates Covid-19||Covid-19 worsened what was already a joblessness crisis in early 2020. The National Statistical Office (NSO) began conducting annual labour force surveys in 2017-18, which hitherto had been undertaken every five years. NSO just released its third annual survey (2019-20), which covers the period until June 30, 2020.In 2017-18, NSO reported that unemployment reached a 45-year high, and youth unemployment tripled between 2011-12 and 2017-18 to over 18%. Thereafter, poor management resulted in economic growth slowing up to March 2020 — compounded by the pandemic and its economic aftermath.What the new data reveals is that the situation remains grim. At first sight, the slight rise over the three years from 2017-18 in the labour force participation rate (LFPR) and workforce participation rates (WPR) (which are measured as a share of those of working age — 15 years and over) may be seen as a positive development.However, India’s LFPR at 40.9% (2019-20, a rise from 38.1% two years earlier) is miles short of the world average of 60.8% in 2019 (which fell to 58.6% in 2020). But a rise in WPR and LFPR at a time when India’s economy was slowing over 2017-18 to 2019-20, needs to be explained.In a slowing economy, incomes are not rising, and distress is increasing. When it comes on top of pre-existing falling trends in employment and wages, the pressure on household resources becomes overbearing.What we have seen in 2019-20 is that while male LFPR and WPR have remained roughly the same, it is females who are searching for, even finding, work. There is little change in male LFPR or WPR over these three years.Also Read | Meghalaya: When two wrongs don’t make a rightThere are, possibly, two forces pushing up LFPR and WPR of women. The first is a wider phenomenon: Girls are being educated at various levels. From 2010 and 2015, the enrolment rate at the secondary level (classes 9-10) shot up from 58% to 85%, and this happened with gender parity.Most states began to incentivise girls’ secondary schooling in 2010, by offering girls who finished class 8 and continued to class 9 and 10 a scholarship or a bicycle so that they could come to school. These girls then had better chances of getting urban jobs. So, female work participation, having fallen for decades, is now finally turning upwards — as it happens in most countries when women’s education levels improve.This, however, is likely to be a weak contributory factor, given how weak the growth process has been, and how only the service sector was creating a limited number of jobs. Women were indeed benefitting from the growth in the service sector in urban areas. However, that trend has reversed in 2019-20. Worse, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), since mid-2020, women have lost work first, even after the lockdown ended; and this trend has continued into 2021.The latest PLFS also reveals that the share of regular jobs has fallen in 2019-20, reversing a trend noticed since 2004-2005. The share of regular wage work was increasing at the expense of self-employment and casual wage work.The second reason is more worrying. Improvements in WPR and LFPR are distress-driven. While these rates may have increased slightly, and may appear to be positive at first sight, it is accompanied by several distressing trends.Also Read | In promotion policies for the military, keep politics outFirst, the 2019-20 data shows that the share of agriculture in the total workforce, which was consistently declining for two decades, has stopped falling, and, in fact, has increased, as the reverse migration from cities in 2020 showed. The increasing share of agriculture in the workforce is a retrogressive step in a developing economy attempting a structural transformation. At the same time, the share of manufacturing in employment, which fell between 2011-12 and 2017-18, fell in 2019-20 again. The share of construction in employment also fell.Second, women dropped out of regular work, and became self-employed. This was driven by distress, and is demonstrated by the fact that the share of women who are unpaid family helpers in the household increased sharply from 2018-19 to 2019-20. That means women were engaged in economic activity (that shows up in an increase in WPR/LFPR), but it is unpaid work.Third, precarity and informality increased from 2018-19 to 2019-20, reversing an ever so slight trend that had set in between 2011-12 and 2017-18, that the share of regular workers who had no social security was falling. Those in regular work without any social security increased from 49.6% of all non-farm regular workers to 54.2% between 2018-19 to 2019-20.Fourth, for all types of work, the average number of hours worked in a week fell sharply in the April-June 2020 quarter, when the economy contracted by 23.7%. Naturally, earnings fell for all households.Thus, on every reasonable measure of the quality of work, there was a perceptible decline.Finally, if anyone still thinks that the fall in the unemployment rate between 2018-19 to 2019-20 from 5.8% to 4.8% is a positive development, think again. By the current weekly status, which is close to the international standard for measuring unemployment, there is no improvement in the unemployment rate between 2017-18 (8.9%) to 2018-19 (8.8%) to 2019-20 (8.8%). These rates remain the worst in the last 48 years since measurement began.Santosh Mehrotra is visiting professor, Centre for Development, University of Bath, UK The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/india-has-an-unemployment-crisis-and-it-predates-covid19-101629287437935.html
18-08-2021||Today's||Overcoming the partition of the minds||Three major partitions happened in the world in the second half of the 1940s. Germany was partitioned into the Eastern and Western blocs in 1945, followed by India into Hindustan and Pakistan in 1947. Finally, Israel was created by partitioning Palestine in 1948.Germany’s partition was temporary. The Berlin Wall, constructed in the early 1960s to accord permanence to it, was dismantled by the Germans in less than three decades. The country was reunified in 1989.But in India and Palestine, partition was a terrible affair, leading to a full-scale war in Israel and mass migration accompanied by mind-numbing violence in India.The Arab-Israel war at the time of the partition of Palestine in 1947-49 caused the death of over 30,000 people. But the death and destruction caused at the time of India’s Partition were horrifying.More than a million were murdered, while many millions more had to endure a treacherous migration across the hastily created border, often on foot. Hundreds of thousands could not make it, as they were waylaid and butchered.Also Read | From 75 to 100, India’s futureThose horrors are difficult to forget. Historian William Dalrymple, in an article in New Yorker, quotes from a book by Nisid Hajari, Midnight’s Furies, about the brutality of the period: “Gangs of killers set whole villages aflame, hacking to death men and children and the aged while carrying off young women to be raped. Some British soldiers and journalists who witnessed the Nazi death camps claimed Partition’s brutalities were worse: pregnant women had their breasts cut off and babies hacked out of their bellies; infants were found literally roasted on spits.”The Partition of India was a meaningless and reckless act. Mahatma Gandhi opposed it saying: “Vivisect me before vivisecting the nation”. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel vowed to fight till the end to reject it. Rajendra Prasad conclusively proved its irrationality in a thoroughly argued 1946-book, India Divided.Across the border, for Saadat Hasan Manto, the famed author, it was all sheer madness. Those women raped, with bulged stomachs, distressed him. “Where should those bellies belong to — Hindustan or Pakistan?” Manto questioned in innocent grief. His dark satire on Partition-time madness, Toba Tek Singh, ends with his eponymous hero Tek Singh seen stranded on no-man’s land between the newly created India and Pakistan. “On one side, behind barbed wire, stood together the lunatics of India and on the other side, behind more barbed wire, stood the lunatics of Pakistan. In between, on a bit of earth which had no name, lay Toba Tek Singh”, Manto provocatively demurs.Partition was not inevitable even until the early 1940s. But then, the British were in a hurry to leave. Louis Mountbatten arrived in India in March 1947 with the mandate to free the country before June 1948. After meeting Mohammad Ali Jinnah, “a psychopathic case”, Mountbatten decided not to wait for that long. In June, he unilaterally declared that the British would partition India and leave in less than three months.Gandhi could not reconcile to the fact that a “maniac” and “an evil genius” like Jinnah could have his way, and retreated to Bengal to attend to the victims of the bigotry and brutality of its rabid communalist premier, Hussain Suhrawardy. Jawaharlal Nehru, who once called Partition “fantastic nonsense”, reconciled quickly and declared in April 1947, “I want that those who stand as an obstacle in our way should go their own way.”In India, Rajendra-babu became the first president of partitioned India, and Nehru its first Prime Minister (PM). In Pakistan, Manto was branded a traitor and thrown into jail, and died a broken man in 1955 at the age of 42.For Hindus, Partition was not merely a loss of territory; it was the vivisection of their revered motherland. The urge for undoing it and reclaiming that lost territory, Akhand Bharat, remains a fervent dream for many of them, as Israel remained for the Jews for over two millennia.The partition of Germany was rejected by people on both sides of the Wall. They pulled it down and ended the colonial game. Both the last PM of East Germany, Lothar de Maizière, and the leader of Opposition, Richard Schröder stood by their people. Despite domestic opposition in the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev demonstrated statesmanship by not interfering.Unfortunately, the Partition of India was not just about land, but about minds. The premise was that Hindus and Muslims cannot live together. Jinnah, who was once hailed as “the Ambassador of Hindu-Muslim Unity” and had disparagingly dismissed the propaganda about Hindu domination as just “a bogey, put before you (Muslims) by your enemies to frighten you”, turned the tables by the 1940s and maniacally argued that they could never live together. He won.The first step to Akhand Bharat would be to bottle the Jinnah genie. Partition-time memories should help mitigate the wounds that communities nurture and end the mental and emotional divide, not exacerbate it further. “This day will not only inspire us to eliminate the poison of discrimination, animosity and ill will, but it will also strengthen unity, social harmony and human sensibilities,” PM Narendra Modi fervently hoped when he recently called for the Partition Horrors Remembrance Day to be observed every August 14. May the day be marked with this spirit.Ram Madhav is a member of the national executive of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and a member of the board of governors of the India Foundation The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/overcoming-the-partition-of-the-minds-101629278497236.html
18-08-2021||Today's||Scientifically Speaking | The shape of things to come in biology||When most people think of the molecules of life, they think of DNA and overlook proteins. In a sense, DNA is a manager that gets the limelight, while proteins toil away behind the scene.Proteins are molecular machines in all living cells. They speed up reactions that make life possible and give form to life. The three-dimensional shape of a protein determines what it does and how well it does its job. It is true for numerous proteins such as haemoglobin, which transports oxygen in our blood and muscle proteins that allow us to move. It is true for antibodies, which help stop viruses and bacteria. It is also true for the proteins that copy DNA and help make more proteins. When certain human proteins fail to fold into their proper shapes, they can give rise to diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. In addition, many drugs work by attaching to the business end of proteins.Proteins are made up of building blocks called amino acids. The order of amino acids in a protein is determined by the sequence of letters in the gene that gives rise to it. One of the great achievements in molecular biology in the past century was finding out how the text of four letters embedded in DNA that all living things have gets “translated” into myriad three-dimensional proteins. It was the elucidation of the genetic code that won Robert W. Holley, Har Gobind Khorana and Marshall W. Nirenberg the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1968.Also Read | There’s more to losing weight than counting caloriesFrom DNA, we can figure out the order of amino acids in a given protein. But the string of amino acids fold into a precise shape every single time that is hard to predict. For the past 50 years, trying to deduce the structure of a protein from just its amino acid sequence has been elusive. Known as the protein folding problem, it has been one of the “grand challenges” of biology.In the intervening decades, scientists have relied on “growing” proteins and experimentally figuring out their structures. This has worked well for around 170,000 proteins spanning the gamut of life. But experimentally determining structures is costly and time-consuming. And it doesn’t always work.For example, the human genome contains over 20,000 protein-coding genes; after decades, we know the shapes of around 17% of the proteins reasonably well.This creates a problem of scalability. Through rapid and cheap sequencing of DNA, sequences of millions of genes that give rise to proteins are known, but we don’t have a solid grasp of what most of the proteins look like. An analogy is that we have millions of sheets of paper with lines on how to fold them into origami, but no accurate way to know what shapes they fold into.Now, it looks like DeepMind, an artificial intelligence (AI) laboratory of Alphabet, has mostly solved the protein folding problem. At a conference last year where participants used computers to predict the structure of a protein from its sequence, the program AlphaFold beat the entire field by a wide margin. More impressively, it was able to predict most of the protein structures to greater than the target 90% score (this is pretty similar to high-quality experimental work in a lab).Also Read | NASA visualises how sea levels will rise in Indian coastal regionsIn a paper published in Nature on July 15, the DeepMind team provided details on how AlphaFold works. AlphaFold used a neural network mimicking the brain. It was fed amino acid sequences that gave rise to known protein structures. Researchers also gave it some basic rules of chemistry and biology to limit the possibilities. And then, the computer made its own associations and “learned” how to predict protein shapes.On July 22, DeepMind researchers followed up with another report in Nature. They predicted nearly every single protein structure from humans (plus those from 20 other important organisms) using AlphaFold. Anyone with internet access can search for these structures from a public database. This truly is Google for proteins.A reasonable expectation is that a PhD student might experimentally solve one or two protein structures in five or six years. DeepMind plans to deposit a whopping 100 million structures by the end of the year. It is safe to say that what AlphaFold has achieved is beyond the capability of human intelligence.Some commentators think that AlphaFold will usher in a new era of drug discovery. It is possible, but pharmaceutical companies already have many proteins that they can target. Often the bottleneck isn’t protein structure, but getting drugs to work in trials and through the regulatory process. For example with the coronavirus, we have structures of many viral proteins, but new drugs that target these proteins have not yet been approved.This leads me to a second point. Proteins are shapeshifters. Proteins can morph shapes by attaching to chemical compounds, cell membranes, and other proteins. A protein structure is a snapshot in time. AlphaFold cannot account for all of this variation yet, and ultimately for important proteins it might not replace human validation either.What excites me most and where I think AlphaFold can immediately contribute is in finding out what many of the millions of poorly-studied proteins actually do. There is huge potential here to discover proteins that help in environmental remediation and in biotechnological processes. For example, we could identify proteins in soil bacteria that help to degrade plastics. We could also find proteins that help certain animals live longer or adapt to specific niches. And as the planet warms, we could identify proteins that help crop plants adapt to rising temperatures.AlphaFold is an exciting step in which AI plays a meaningful role in biology. Over time, we can expect humans and machines to work together in solving many other grand challenges.Anirban Mahapatra, a microbiologist by training, is the author of COVID-19: Separating Fact From FictionThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/scientifically-speaking-the-shape-of-things-to-come-in-biology-101629277477117.html
18-08-2021||Editorials||Don’t believe the Taliban’s rhetoric. Women’s rights are under threat||As the Taliban takes over Afghanistan, Afghan women, fearful of their lives and rights, have been speaking up. These fears are rooted in the country’s dark history of the Taliban rule, between 1996 and 2001, when systemic violations of women and girls were institutionalised. The regime imposed Sharia and interpreted the Islamic law ruthlessly, prohibiting women from working and girls from attending school, and allowing women in public places only if they covered their faces and were escorted by male relatives.Now, as the Taliban returns, so do memories of the horrors of its brutal rule. Nearly a quarter of a million Afghans were forced to flee since the end of May, 80% of them women and children, according to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. More Afghan women and children were killed in the first half of 2021 than in the first six months of any year since records were kept in 2009.Also Read | #TalibanCrisis: Afghans in Delhi worried about family back homeThe last two decades saw millions of Afghan girls attending school and Afghan women engaging in public life — for instance, female literacy rate shot up from less than 17% in 2000 to 30% in 2018, as per the World Bank. The Taliban has, in its first press conference since the takeover, said that it will honour women’s rights, albeit within the norms of Islamic law. While this can be seen as an attempt to win international legitimacy, it is important to go by the Taliban’s actions and history, and not merely words. The international community must make the equal and fair treatment of women a precondition for formally recognising the Taliban regime in Afghanistan — with an enforcement mechanism to ensure that reality matches commitments. The brutalisation of women must not be allowed again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/dont-believe-the-taliban-s-rhetoric-women-s-rights-are-under-threat-101629285457506.html
