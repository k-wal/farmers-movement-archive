The BJP has been ambivalent on the issue, citing logistical impediments in carrying out the mammoth exercise as an excuse. In Parliament, the government said it has decided against a caste-based count, though some party leaders have off and on record stated there is merit in the demand.Also Read | A strategic shock for the subcontinentAccording to a person close to the JD(U) leader, the demand for caste-based census was first raised by Kumar in 1990 following a meeting with the former President Giani Zail Singh. “He told Kumar that the time is right for him to raise the issue,” the person said.Though Mandal politics that ensued in 1990s was marked by agitations, in the current scenario, the Bihar CM has been careful not to appear adversarial to his ally though he is seen as the face of the coalition demanding a numerical dissection of castes and how they have benefited from welfare schemes.“He has raised the demand without sidestepping political niceties and by taking along adversaries,” said the person quoted above.To a question on whether Kumar envisages a larger role for himself by leading a coalition that is pushing for the caste-based count, JD(U) general secretary KC Tyagi said there is greater acceptability among parties on the need for caste-based enumeration and the issue is not as polarising as it was in the 1990s. “The atmosphere during the Mandal movement was that of agitation. There was acrimony between castes and leaders but that is not the case now. Parties such as the Bjiu Janata Dal, the YSR Congress Party, the Shiv Sena and Telugu Desam Party are also demanding caste-based census along with socialist parties such as the JD(U) and the RJD. Even the second-in-command in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh Dattatreya Hosabale has said that reservation should continue till the time there in inequality,” Tyagi said.Also Read | In India’s climate law, focus more on process, less on outcomesTyagi also likened Nitish Kumar to CN Annadurai, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader who led a campaign for justice for the so-called lower castes. “He (Kumar) has been successful in leading the campaign for social justice and will emerge as the Annadurai of North India,” Tyagi said.Though the BJP has been tight lipped about Kumar driving the demand, the bonhomie between him and RJD’s Tejaswi Yadav has led to discomfort within the alliance.“The government has said it will look into the demand. He (Kumar) himself said that they were happy with the meeting (with the PM)… these are issues that need consultation and logistical planning. It’s not something anyone can claim credit for,” said a senior BJP leader.The leader declined to comment on whether this was the JD(U) leader’s attempt at repositioning himself in the alliance in the state.“There is no denying that the JD(U) feels that it suffered during the assembly elections because of the campaign targetting the CM by the Lok Janashakti Party. There has been a strain in ties after BJP emerged as the bigger partner with more seats,” said a third JD(U) leader from Bihar. While the BJP won 74 seats in the 243 member assembly, the JD(U) won only 43 and also got a single berth in the Union council of ministers.Commenting on Kumar asserting his supremacy in Bihar, political commentator Sandeep Shastri said, “After the Bihar elections, there was a sidelining of the CM as was indicated by the number of ministers from JD(U) who became part of the Union council of ministers. He is looking at asserting himself as the spokesperson of the OBCs across the country.”Will a re-emergence of Mandal politics with Kumar as its face deepen the fissures in the BJP-JD(U) ties? Shastri suggests otherwise. He said the BJP leadership does not seem averse to the idea of a caste-based census as the party is no longer identified as a Brahmin-Bania or an upper caste only political entity but one with a wider base among the OBCs.“Agreeing to a caste-based census would be a logical corollary to the passage of the Constitution (127th Amendment) Bill in Parliament. It won’t pose a problem for the BJP since the Hindutva constituency is with them and is not going to go away and by agreeing to a caste-based census it will consolidate its position among the OBCs,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/nitish-kumar-positions-himself-as-the-face-of-mandal-20-101629950539664.html
26-08-2021||Mumbai||Police seal Nagpur’s 200-year-old red light area||Days after clamping section 144 of the CrPC in city’s Red-Light district in central Nagpur – Ganga Jamuna – following complaints of open solicitation by commercial sex workers, the Nagpur police Thursday banned prostitution in the area for two months. The flesh trade has been running at Ganga Jamuna for the last 20 years from the Bhonsale regime. Issuing a notification under the Prevention of Immoral Trafficking Act (PITA), Nagpur commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar warned of legal action against those flouting the orders. With the ban in place, the police can now jail a person found indulging in prostitution in the area. As per the notification issued under Section 7(1) (b) of PITA, the CP has power to notify public places within a distance of 200 meters of which prostitution cannot be carried by any person on any premises. The police have appealed to the citizens to send their objection by email to the commissioner’s office or submit a written complaint at CP Office, Nagpur. “It was brought to my notice that several offences have been registered during the last five years under PITA for carrying out prostitution in or in the vicinity of Balaji Mandir, Chinteshwar Mandir, Baba Kamlishah Dargah, Durga Devi Mandir, Sharda Devi Mandir, Radha Swami Satsang, NMC’s Chinteshwar Hindi Primary School, Hindustan High School (all these places are situated in the vicinity of Ganga Jamuna),” stated the notification. “The premises within a distance of 200 meters from the above referred public places shall not be used for the purpose of prostitution and hereby it is declared that the violation of notification will attract liability and prosecution of such violator, under Section 7 (1-A), Section 7 (2) (a), 2 (b) and 2 (c) of PITA and relevant Sections of law, depending upon the nature of violation.” The statistics issued by Nagpur police prove that minors were forced into flesh trade in the Ganga Jamuna area. The police have rescued 109 minors from here in the last 10 years and as many as 1,137 accused persons were booked by the police during the period. Senior Nationalist Congress Party leader Jwala Dhote, who is the daughter of once stormy petrol of Vidarbha, late Jambuwantrao Dhote, condemned the police action and launched an agitation along with sex workers. “Police cannot take such arbitrary action without providing the (CSWs) an alternative employment,” she insisted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/police-seal-nagpur-s-200-year-old-red-light-area-101630002563630.html

26-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: 14 Covid cases in a month, Kandivli residential complex sealed||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Thursday sealed a residential complex of five buildings in Kandivli (West) after 14 Covid-19 cases were found in a period of one month. Civic officials said eight of the 14 patients have recovered. However, none of these 14 cases were of Delta or Delta plus variant, clarified BMC. Sandhya Nandekar, assistant municipal commissioner of the BMC’s R-South Ward that covers Kandivli, said, “We got 14 cases in one housing society complex due to which we sealed it as per the protocol. However, there is no reason to panic considering these 14 cases have been reported over the past one month and eight people have recovered.” The BMC said the cases started coming from two families and later others in the housing society also tested positive. They were symptomatic. Overall, in Kandivli, five Delta plus variant cases have been reported in the last one month and all five have recovered, according to BMC officials. Overall, the civic body has sealed 22 and 1,089 floors in the city. The BMC seals a part of the building only when multiple cases of Covid are detected in a housing society. In case of one or two isolated cases, only the particular floor of the building is sealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-14-covid-cases-in-a-month-kandivli-residential-complex-sealed-101630002085067.html

The new system – a deviation from current four-member ward system in Pune - can lead to massive defections, political leaders observed. Some Congress leaders said a single-member ward is more beneficial to the Maha Vikas Agadi (an alliance of Congress-NCP-Shiv Sena ruling the state) than the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in power in the PMC. Leaders from the local BJP unit demanded two- member wards in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. NCP city unit president Prashant Jagtap said, “NCP is ready to contest elections under any structure. But we are hoping that the state government would have two -member wards for Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.”Political observers noted that those with a strong network of workers can be beneficiaries, while others wanting to ride their party’s image can suffer under the single-member system. For BJP and NCP, the new system may not be very beneficial, while for Congress, which is struggling to get a foothold in Pune, it can provide some relief. NCP sources however, maintained that the party is considering that if the two-member ward structure is allowed, it would be more helpful for the party to win maximum seats. A senior BJP member from the city accepted that the single and two-member ward structure is more helpful for the MVA. The BJP wants to fight the PMC elections on the basis of the party’s overall image, instead of relying on candidates. The BJP currently rules the PMC with 99 corporators, while NCP has 42, Congress has 10, Shiv Sena has 10 and the MNS has 2 corporators in the house of 164 members. A BJP leader, speaking anonymously said, “Now that the MVA is ruling in the state, they will make the ward system convenient to them. There are some pockets in each city, which are favourable for specific parties. So the ward structure makes a difference.” With the merger of 23 villages under PMC, the tally of corporators is likely to go up to 166. As per the reservation system for local bodies, 50% of wards have to be reserved for women. The BJP, with a strong women’s wing, may benefit under this system. Congress and Shiv Sena are both comfortable with single-member wards in the city. Congress leader Aba Bagul and Sena leader Prithviraj Chavan said, “We are happy with the present single-member ward structure and are ready to contest. The state government will take the final decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/who-stands-to-gain-with-single-member-ward-systems-in-pmc-pcmc-101630001662995.html

Organised by the Stockholm International Water Institute since 1991, the theme this year is “Building Resilience Faster”.On the occasion, the Ram Nadi Rejuvenation mission and the Kirloskar Vasundhara foundation inaugurated a new project involving school students to help restore the Ram nadi (river).“We have selected 25 schools which are along the 19km stretch of the Ram nadi. Teachers will be trained to introduce the Ram nadi to their students. Most of the schools are corporation schools and there are some public schools,” said Virendra Chitrav, co-ordinator, Kirloskar Vasundhara.“The teachers will be trained by to look at the history of rivers and how human culture has grown and flourished along rivers. Evidence that many human cultures have been lost due to the disappearance of rivers can be seen in the history of human beings,” Chitrave said, adding that the plan is to revive the Ram nadim, which is in a very bad condition.Managing director of Kirloskar Pneumatics, Dr Suresh Mijar said, “We have to give to society the values that Shantanurao Kirloskar inculcated many decades ago. Thus, we have joined this NGO and participated in the river revival work. The teacher is considered to be a sensitive and responsible factor. The stories told through them are instilled in the minds of children at a receptive age in an effective manner. Therefore, the role of teachers will be important in the rehabilitation of rivers.”This school campaign was launched on Wednesday in the presence of Chandrakant Patil, along with managing director of Kirloskar Pneumatics, Dr Suresh Mijar, Pune Municipal Corporation education board president Manjushree Khardekar, Anil Gaikwad from Vasundhara Abhiyaan, corporator Swapnali Saikar, and corporator Jyoti Kalamkar in Baner.Saving the Ram nadiThe Ram nadi flows through Khatpewadi, Bhugaon, Bhukum, Bavdhan, Pashan, Baner and Aundh and has been in a troubled state for decades. Years of uncontrolled dumping of garbage and untreated waste have nearly destroyed the ecological diversity of the river.In 2015, the National Green Tribunal, while responding to complaints of encroachment and dumping of garbage, had called for a stop to all construction along the river’s banks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ngo-kirloskar-vasundhara-launch-project-with-schools-to-revive-ram-nadi-101630001603766.html
26-08-2021||Delhi||MCDs illegally waived licence fee for BJP, alleges AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations of Delhi (MCDs) of illegally waiving the licence fee for contractors who put up advertisement hoardings and billboards, thereby perpetrating financial irregularities to the tune of ₹2,640 crore.“The MCDs have acted against the law. They have maliciously and illegally waived the entire licence fee for advertisement contractors. The BJP is conspiring with contractors to get free advertisements in return for waiving the licence fee amounting to crores of rupees. The BJP manipulated advertisement contractors to put up hoardings in Delhi for free,” said AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj in a press conference at the party head office in central Delhi.He further said, “The BJP-ruled MCDs could have earned ₹2,640 crore in advertising revenue, but the BJP is looting that money through corruption. Minutes of the standing committee meeting were illegally changed to cover up BJP’s scam.”Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor dismissed the allegations and said the AAP leaders are frustrated after the exposure of the financial irregularities taking place in the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) since 2015, when AAP first came to power. “Nobody knows where loans amounting to ₹60,000 crore, taken by the DJB in past 7 years, have gone. Similarly they are frustrated because a CBI inquiry has been ordered Into the DTC scam. To save face, AAP leaders are raising baseless allegations against the three MCDs regarding the advertising revenue. Everybody knows that private companies are not spending on ads and advertising contractors are in loss. Trying to correlate that with the party’s political advertising is a concocted theory,” he said. The BJP had earlier alleged irregularities in the Delhi government’s procurement of new buses, which they had termed the “DTC scam”.Kapoor said Bhardwaj should first tell the people of Delhi who had paid for the hundreds of hoardings put up by AAP leaders, greeting CM Arvind Kejriwal on his birthday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mcds-illegally-waived-licence-fee-for-bjp-alleges-aap-101630000882903.html

We were watching their activities,” Yadav said.Police said they were monitoring some social media accounts for the past three months. “More than three months of surveillance led the team to a private Facebook page dedicated to the Khalistan movement. Access to this page was denied as the group was private. Technical approaches were used to gain access to the page and it was kept under surveillance. A person was posting photos and videos of firearms for sale on the account. A virtual phone number given on the handle was cracked by the special cell team,” Yadav said.Monitoring of the cell phone number led to information that two men associated with the racket will be coming to Karala -Barwala road in Rohini area on Wednesday around 8.30pm. A police team arrested the two suspects from the spot, DCP Yadav said. During interrogation, Rajender said many people from Barwani town in Madhya Pradesh were engaged in this racket. He said the firearms were sent through human ‘couriers’. Initial investigation has shown that the two suspects learnt to run the racket online from members of the Lawrence Bishnoi group. Bishnoi is a notorious gangster who has criminal cases registered against him in Delhi, Rajasthan and Punjab. “Rajender Singh told the police that the used to supply illegal weapons to Khalistani activists in Punjab. He used to communicate through social media and other apps to avoid detection by the police,” added Yadav. During questioning, Rajender told the police the they used to sell a pistol for ₹25,000- ₹50,000.The other suspect, Bablu Singh is Rajender’s relative, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-police-arrest-gunrunners-who-supplied-arms-to-alleged-khalistani-activists-101630000823666.html

The issue was also discussed at length at the state’s cabinet meeting. State health minister Rajesh Tope said “The third wave is imminent; hence it would be better if elections can be postponed in Maharashtra. Chief minister (Uddhav Thackeray), deputy chief minister (Ajit Pawar) and members of the state task force will explain to the concerned authority why it is necessary to postpone polls in the state.”“We want the state election commission not to make any announcement before consulting the state government as we all are worried about the anticipated third wave,” said a senior minister on conditions of anonymity.Tope even held a telephonic meeting with the Kerala health minister after the state recorded 31,455 cases on Wednesday. “Kerala’s health minister told me that there was a surge in the number of cases after the Onam festival. They have now increased the rate of testing,” said Tope.“We will be appointing 1,200 doctors by September 5. In addition, the 1,200 metric tons of oxygen is being increased to 2,000 metric tons. We have purchased 1,000 ambulances and have taken ₹5,000 crore loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the construction of hospitals,” said Tope. “We had 6.5 lakh active patients during the second wave and this time, we anticipate 13 lakh active patients. We have beefed up our infrastructure to accommodate them,” said Tope.He added that the Central government has promised to give 18 million doses to Maharashtra, which is an increase of five million from the previous month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-5-108-new-cases-with-159-deaths-101630000763839.html

On Thursday, Jain visited the under-construction site with chief of Delhi Commission for Women Swati Maliwal. This comes a day after the minister inaugurated a 30-bed rapid response centre for Covid-19 patients at Rajeev Gandhi Superspecialty Hospital, that will provide immediate treatment to patients down with the viral infection even before admission. “These wards at the LNJP hospital will be equipped with all necessary Covid-19 related medical facilities like oxygen beds, ventilators, and ICUs. October 15 has been set as the deadline for the construction of these wards,” said Jain. The Delhi government plans to keep 37,000 beds, including 12,000 ICU beds, ready across hospitals and makeshift facilities as part of its preparation for the third wave. During the April-May surge in Covid-19 cases, over 20,000 people with the infection were admitted at a go across facilities, according to the government data. The city ran out of ICU beds in April-end when there were just over 4,700 ICU beds earmarked for Covid-19 patients.The number was further scaled up to over 6,000 in May. “We are closely monitoring the situation in Delhi and all the necessary lessons are being taken from the previous Covid-19 waves to form appropriate policies in the public interest. The Kejriwal government is focused on strengthening the bed capacity of the Delhi government hospitals to ensure high-quality treatment that is accessible to all, in case there is a third wave of Covid-19,” said Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/work-on-100-bed-mother-child-ward-to-be-completed-by-oct-15-jain-101630000643016.html
26-08-2021||Delhi||Forest dept plants over 1,000 saplings along Ghazipur drain to mask stench||To mask the stench from the Ghazipur drain, the Delhi forest department has started a mega plantation drive around the sewer, one of the largest in the city, senior officials said. Aditya Madanpotra, deputy conservator forests (central division), said the plantation drive along the Ghazipur drain started earlier this month and, so far, the department had planted nearly 1,100 saplings along the drain. “The idea behind this drive is to filter out the foul smell from the drain and to increase the green cover in the area. This season, over 1,100 saplings have been planted along the drain,” said Madanpotra. According to the government’s irrigation and flood control department records, the Ghazipur drain in north-east Delhi spans a length of 6.24km and has a catchment area of 6,741 hectares. The profuse discharge of untreated sewage into the drain has resulted in high toxicity and a foul stench permeating the areas nearby the drain. The regular dumping of solid waste has also worsened the situation, officials said. Senior forest department officials said plantation along the Ghazipur drain is a pilot project, and if it yields the desired results, such drives will be carried out alongside other major drains in the city. “The science behind increasing the green cover along a natural drain is that trees and shrubs absorb a large amount of pollutants and toxicity released from the drain. As years go by, and the area becomes greener, the trees will also act as a natural boundary and discourage encroachments on the drain,” said a forest official, requesting anonymity. The official further said, “After some time, these trees and shrubs will create a natural ecosystem and help replenish the soil.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/forest-dept-plants-over-1-000-saplings-along-ghazipur-drain-to-mask-stench-101630000583801.html
26-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC dismisses plea challenging reserved treatment facilities for govt officials||The Delhi high court on Thursday dismissed a plea by a Delhi based doctor challenging the decision of the Delhi government to link four hotels with two hospitals for the treatment of government officials and their families during the second wave of Covid-19. A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said there was no merit in the contentions raised by petitioner Kaushal Kant Mishra who argued that creating such exclusive facilities for officials violated the fundamental rights of the citizens of Delhi, who were deprived of Covid-19 treatment owing to limited resources.The court refused to accept the submission of the petitioner’s counsel that resources of the state remained unutilised due to the exclusive reservation of facilities for government officials and their families. It said the plea has not considered the ground reality during the second wave.In an April 27 notification, the Delhi government had reserved 240 rooms in four hotels and linked them to two hospitals for Covid-19 treatment of officials of various public authorities and their families.According to the notification, 70 rooms in Hotel Ginger at Vivek Vihar, 50 rooms in Hotel Park Plaza in Shahdara, and 50 rooms in Hotel Leela Ambience at CBD Ground in Karkardooma were linked to Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital and all the rooms in Hotel Golden Tulip at Hari Nagar were linked to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (DDU) for the treatment of officers/officials of the Delhi government, autonomous bodies, corporations, local bodies and their families.On Wednesday, while dictating a part of the order, the court questioned how the government machinery would have functioned if its employees were not assured treatment.“The wheels of administration in the NCT of Delhi would have come to a grinding halt without this much assurance to the officials that they will receive treatment, they would not have been able to discharge their duties without fear,” the bench had said.“We are not living in ivory towers. We were seeing what was happening in the city during the second wave on a daily basis. Thousands of people were looking at the state for some relief…In our view such officers clearly constitute a different class on account of their duties which they were required to perform during the peak of the pandemic. They were required to come to duties by stepping out of the comfort of their homes and they had no option to remain inside,” the court had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-dismisses-plea-challenging-reserved-treatment-facilities-for-govt-officials-101630000583060.html

Around 10,000 beds have been readied for handling the third wave. Also, we have vaccinated 100 per cent of the teachers," the CM, who holds the health portfolio, told reporters at Kolkata's SSKM hospital.Mandaviya had on Wednesday said that more than two crore additional doses of Covid-19 vaccines will be distributed among states this month for vaccinating all school teachers on priority before Teachers’ Day on September 5. The CM, while talking to the reporters, further said that experienced nurses and those who have put up exceptional performances would be promoted to the post of "practitioner sisters".They will have responsibilities "quite similar to that of the doctors", she said. "These nurses can pitch in when there is a dearth of doctors. The health department will come out with an official guideline in the matter," she added.Banerjee stated that quack doctors in the state’s rural areas will be given adequate training and asked to serve at primary health centres.

26-08-2021||Lucknow||Allahabad HC says custodial deaths 'concern for civilised society'||The Allahabad High Court has refused bail to a policeman, accused of causing custodial death of a man, observing that "custodial violence, custodial torture and custodial deaths have always been a concern for civilised society". Rejecting the bail application of Sher Ali, Justice Samit Gopal quoted the judicial verdict of the apex court passed in the case of DK Basu vs State of West Bengal where the Supreme Court had expressed its anguish over custodial deaths and had issued guidelines for arrest in order to check such incidents. In the present case, complainant Sanjay Kumar Gupta alleged that on December 28, 1997, some policemen came to his house and took away his father Gokrakhnath alias Om Prakash Gupta. Later, he was told by the policemen that his father died due to heart attack. Denying the version given by the police, Gupta alleged that his father was mercilessly and inhumanly assaulted due to which he died in the police station. The FIR was registered against Ali under section 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder), 304 (culpable homicide) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/allahabad-hc-says-custodial-deaths-concern-for-civilised-society-101629997229782.html
26-08-2021||Lucknow||Urdu poet Munawwar Rana’s son gets bail within hours of arrest||A Rae Bareli court on Thursday granted bail to Urdu poet Munawwar Rana’s son Tabrez Rana just hours after he was arrested on Wednesday night for allegedly scripting an attack on himself with the intent of framing his relatives, said his lawyer.Tabrez was arrested from his house in Lucknow after a Rae Bareli court issued a non-bailable warrant against him for not appearing before the court on August 13 in the matter.His lawyer Yassab Rizvi said the arrest was against the Allahabad high court order of not initiating proceedings against Tabrez Rana under IPC section 307 for attempt to murder.The lawyer said an application has also been forwarded to additional director general (ADG) zone, SN Sabat, about the suspicious role of Rae Bareli police in the entire incident. “The complainant has demanded action against the Rae Bareli police as it was violation of his rights as he was arrested with the intent of harassment,” Rizvi said.Sharing further details, the lawyer said Tabrez had alleged that two motorcycle-borne shooters had opened fire on his SUV when he had stopped at a petrol pump under the Rae Bareli city police station limits on June 28. He said four people reported to have been involved in the attack were arrested on July 2 and they alleged that the attack was planned with the consent of Tabrez.According to police, Tabrez had sold off his 18 biswa land in February this year. It was his parental property and his other relatives also had a share in it. Tabrez’s relatives were raising objection on the issue and demanding their share, after which he allegedly hired shooters to stage the attack on his SUV with the intent of framing his relatives.The lawyer said the Rae Bareli police had initially registered the FIR under IPC section 307 for attempt to murder on June 28 but later added section 211 for framing a person after self-scripting the attack and section 120-B for criminal conspiracy. He said the police were initiating proceedings against Tabrez Rana under IPC section 307 but high court on July 13, 2021 had ordered not to take action under this section while the remaining two sections 211 and 120-B were bailable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/urdu-poet-munawwar-rana-s-son-gets-bail-within-hours-of-arrest-101629998423774.html
26-08-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram murder spree: Statements of accused, family members contradictory, say cops||The police said they found contradictions in statements given by the family members of a 59-year-old retired army subedar, who surrendered to the police after allegedly killing his daughter-in-law and three tenants at his Sector 105 residence on Tuesday. They will take the suspect to the crime scene to establish the correct sequence of events, officials said.“The suspects, their son and daughter are changing their statements during questioning. On Thursday, they changed their statements at least seven times,” Deepak Saharan, the deputy commissioner of police, who is investigating the case, said.“Although we have recorded his statement and his wife’s statement, before she was sent to judicial custody, the sequence of events will be recorded on camera. We want to match both the sequences to complete our dossier and this will be recorded for further proceedings,” Saharan said. He said the police were analysing CCTV footage, call detail records and other sources to fill the gaps pertaining to the four murders that are likely to have taken place between 2am and 5am on Tuesday. According to the police, the main suspect, Rao Rai Singh, told them that he killed his daughter-in-law, Sunita Yadav, 40, over a suspicion that she was having an extramarital affair with a tenant, Krishan Tiwari, 45. Singh allegedly confessed to also having killed the tenant, his wife Anamika Tiwari, 35 and their nine-year-old daughter. A three-year-old daughter of the tenant survived the attack and was reported to be stable on Wednesday evening, after undergoing treatment at Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi. She was attacked four times on her head, neck, arms and chest, the police said. A day after Singh’s surrender, the police arrested his wife, Bimlesh Yadav, 55, for her alleged involvement.Saharan said that during the investigation, they found that Singh had been previously married and Bimlesh Yadav is his second wife. “His first wife died in mysterious circumstances within 10 months of getting married. She was cremated without a post-mortem examination. We are trying to check from her relatives and family members regarding Singh’s conduct,” Saharan said.The police said that besides Singh’s son, a lawyer at the Gurugram court who claimed to be in Rajasthan at the time of the murders, they also questioned his daughter, who lives with her husband and in-laws in another part of the city. “The son of the suspect who was in Rajasthan when the crime took place has given evidence of his presence in a religious place but we are yet to establish the same,” Saharan said. Saharan said that they analysed the son’s mobile phone and found it suspicious that there were only a few selfies from different locations earlier this week, but no other photos of the places he had visited. “We have checked his mobile and have scanned the data. He has only clicked selfies on Monday and Tuesday, which is unusual. We have recovered CCTV footage from a few locations and our three teams visited different spots in Rajasthan to check his sequence of events,” he said. The family members and relatives of Sunita Yadav said they would meet the police commissioner on Friday and approach the court to get legal custody of her nine-year-old daughter, who was sleeping on the first floor at the time of the incident. The three-year-old daughter of the tenants will be taken to Siwan in Bihar by her relatives on Monday, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-murder-spree-statements-of-accused-family-members-contradictory-say-cops-101629997883460.html
26-08-2021||Gurugram||Vaccine mixup at Sector 49 session site||An incident of Covid-19 vaccine mixup was reported from a government-run session site at Rosewood City in Sector 49 on Wednesday, when a 22-year-old beneficiary who had taken the first shot of Covaxin was inoculated with Covishield. “The man had taken the first shot of Covaxin. At the site, when our team asked for the first dose certificate, he could not show it. The vaccinating officer refused to give him the shot but he assured to that he would ask a friend to send the certificate through WhatsApp. A few minutes after getting vaccinated, he realised that he had to be given Covaxin and not Covishield,” Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer, said.The beneficiary, Harteerath Singh, refuted the allegations made by the health department. “The vaccination centre had both the vaccines. I showed the certificate at the site. Then the staff asked me to wait while they were feeding the details into the portal. Thereafter, they vaccinated me and congratulated me on getting the second dose of Covishield. I panicked upon hearing that I was given Covishield and reached out to a senior medical officer about the mixup done by the vaccinator. I was kept under observation for nearly two hours,” said Teerath.He said he took the vaccine shot at the Tigra urban primary health centre around 11.20am on Wednesday and developed fever and body ache on Thursday. He works as a community development director with a non-governmental organisation. However, health department officials denied that the side effects were due to the vaccine mixup.Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said, “We are inquiring into the matter.”On Wednesday, Singh had tweeted: “First dose Covaxin, second dose Covishield despite showing the certificate. Please advise urgently on what to do.” In a second tweet on Wednesday night, he tweeted: “I am educated enough to know the difference between two kinds of vaccine and won’t suddenly realise. Even the doctor at the vaccination centre admitted to human error.”This is the third case of vaccine mixup in Haryana after similar incidents in Kaithal and Mahendergarh. Dr VK Paul, the head of India’s Covid-19 task force, on May 27 said that vaccine mixups are unlikely to have any significant health impact.In May, a major controversy erupted after a group of villagers in Siddharth Nagar district of Uttar Pradesh were given mixed doses. Studies are ongoing to understand the mix-and-match approach to Covid-19 vaccines for protection against coronavirus infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/vaccine-mixup-at-sector-49-session-site-101629997829329.html
26-08-2021||Gurugram||Offices reminded to strictly follow Covid-19 safeguards||With government and private offices starting to reopen with full staff strength, the health department on Thursday reached out to the district administration and police commissioner’s office to circulate an advisory on the standard operating procedures (SOPs) to be followed by offices for preventing transmission of the Covid-19 infection.“As directed by the state health department on Thursday, both government and private offices have to follow the office SOPs to prevent Covid-19 infection from spreading. The district administration will be circulating the advisory to all corporate offices and industrial units that are running with full attendance. Even as the daily Covid-19 cases are on a downward trend, offices will have to follow appropriate Covid-19 behaviour, observe social distancing and ensure their staff is fully vaccinated,” Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said.The district on Thursday reported six new cases of coronavirus infection. At least 72 cases are currently active, while the total tally is 181,039. The death toll is 922.According to Yadav, offices will have to follow SOPs issued by the union ministry of health and family welfare on February 13 this year. This includes symptom checks at entrances, extra precautions for workers who are at a higher risk of contracting the infection, like older people, pregnant women and those with underlying health conditions, mask hygiene at all times inside the offices, restrictions on the number of people in elevators and regular sanitisation of office premises in case positive cases are detected.The district administration officials are also preparing for a possible third Covid-19 wave and met representatives of private companies regarding the installation of Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants for medical use.Additional deputy commissioner Vishram Kumar Meena said that 14 oxygen plants will be installed in the district under Corporate Social Responsibility, of which six plants have been set up by Maruti Suzuki India Private Limited and one by Powergrid, which is the biggest oxygen plant in the state with a capacity to generate 1,650 litres per minute ( LPM). In a statement issued by the district administration, the remaining plants to be set up by other companies are in the process of being installed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/offices-reminded-to-strictly-follow-covid-19-safeguards-101629997827762.html
26-08-2021||Gurugram||Multilevel car parks to come up near Iffco Chowk Metro station, Sector 29||The Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) will develop two multilevel parking facilities near Kingdom of Dreams in Sector 29 and the Iffco Chowk Metro station, a letter issued by the office of the chief administrator, HSVP, stated. Tenders for these two facilities will be floated next month.These two facilities will have the capacity to accommodate 2,500 cars in total, while 30% of the space will be allocated for commercial operations.According to the letter, the facility in Sector 29 will be constructed on 2.2 acres and will be able to accommodate 1,100 cars. Likewise, the facility site near Iffco Chowk Metro station is being planned on 2.89 acres, with a capacity to accommodate up to 1,450 cars.Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner, Gurugram, said that there is an acute need to increase designated parking spaces in the city as the number of vehicles has increased over the years. “On weekends, parking space is difficult to get in Sector 29 and with people returning to offices, more space (for parking) would be needed on MG Road. After the creation of these facilities, there is a need to strictly enforce traffic rules and ensure vehicles are parked in these spaces. This will end traffic jams and reduce congestion on city roads,” he said.To prepare a detailed tender for these two projects, a committee comprising superintending engineer one, estate officer two and senior officials from accounts and related departments was created, while another committee, headed by the chief administrator of Gurugram, will evaluate the bidders.“The recommendation of the above said committee shall be put up to the chief administrator, HSVP, for arranging the formal approval of the competent authority i.e meeting of the authority, under the chairmanship of chief minister cum chairman, HSVP,” stated the letter (a copy of which is with HT) issued by the additional chief engineer, headquarters, chief administrator, HSVP, Panchkula.Amit Arya, a media advisor to the Haryana chief minister, who is the HSVP chairman, said, “Two such facilities are already coming up in Old Gururgam and these two in sector 29 and near Iffco Chowk will help in decongesting busy roads. The projects will also include commercial space and this will make it a viable option as well.”As a part of the 30% commercial component, the facilities can have restaurants, shopping malls and automobile showrooms. These will be developed on a build-own-transfer basis and the height of these buildings would be 30 metres. The project will have to be developed in 21 months from the date of start, the letter stated.Prof Sewa Ram, a transport expert with the School of Planning and Architecture, Delhi, said that the parking facilities are required near Iffco Chowk and in Sector 29, as both are commercial and corporate hubs with a high volume of traffic. “There is a metro station near both these places and lot activities take place in malls and corporate offices, while residents also frequent these areas. This move will reduce on-street parking but the key would be offering parking at the right price. It is also important that last-mile connectivity is also facilitated,” he said.These two multilevel facilities would be in addition to the facilities being developed at Sadar Bazar and Kaman Sarai by the Municipal Corporation Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/multilevel-car-parks-to-come-up-near-iffco-chowk-metro-station-sector-29-101629997824773.html
26-08-2021||Gurugram||Key new sector road from Dhankot Chowk to Delhi to be repaired by GMDA||A key 11-kilometre unnamed road between Dhankot Chowk and Delhi-Haryana border will be repaired and upgraded by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) from October, officials said on Thursday.The stretch between sectors 99 and 115, running parallel to the Dwarka Expressway, provides new sector residents connectivity with areas in Delhi, such as Sector 29 in Dwarka, IGI Airport, Chhawla, and other parts of southwest and west Delhi. The stretch also runs parallel to the Najafgarh drain.With the construction of the Dwarka Expressway still underway, there is a high volume of traffic on this six-lane, 75-metre wide stretch throughout the day. Barring a two-kilometre portion between New Palam Vihar and Delhi border, which was constructed in 2018, the remaining nine kilometres are heavily pothole-ridden.To fix this, the GMDA on Wednesday floated a tender for hiring a contractor to maintain the stretch for one year. GMDA officials said that the contractor will carry out patchwork, which primarily involves filling potholes and levelling the stretch, from October.“The sector 99-115 stretch is among many roads across the city that was constructed by the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) in the early 2000s. The liability period of such roads is over and traffic patterns have changed. The rationale behind original road designs have also changed dramatically over time,” Shweta Sharma, the executive engineer of infrastructure division 1, GMDA, said.Sharma, who floated a ₹1.87 crore tender on behalf of the GMDA, said that all roads are designed with a life span of five years for the top layer and 15 years for sub-layers.“The life spans of both the top layer and sub-layers are over. Through augmentation, special repairs, annual maintenance of major stretches, GMDA is aiming to upgrade them to such a standard that they not only meet today’s demands but also adhere to the master plan, keeping future developments in mind,” said Sharma.Till the early 2010s, the HSVP used to carry out all major development projects, such as construction and maintenance of roads and drains. These were gradually transferred to the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) upon its creation in 2008.In March 2018, the MCG transferred amenities such as master roads, green belts and master drains to the GMDA six months after its creation.Satbir Singh, a resident of Sector 102, who uses this stretch every day, said that until the Dwarka Expressway is completed, the 11-kilometre stretch will continue to be highly accessed by commuters as it not only provides a shorter route for new sector residents to reach the Delhi airport, Dwarka, or head towards west Delhi, but also helps them avoid congestion on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway and Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road.“For residents living along Dwarka Expressway, the 11-kilometre road is a lifeline and provides connectivity to thousands who work in Delhi and do a daily commute by this route. In patches, the stretch has a large number of deep potholes that not only make driving difficult but also leads to minor accidents. Its repair has been a longstanding demand and an upgrade would facilitate faster and safer travel,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/key-new-sector-road-from-dhankot-chowk-to-delhi-to-be-repaired-by-gmda-101629997823408.html

Unlike traditional bhishis that involve the exchange of money, Dixit’s bhishis are all about the exchange of plants and saplings and what’s more, they now comprise as many as 54 women members.“The lockdown had almost everyone finding it difficult to keep themselves busy, more so if they were intelligent and used to multitasking. Hence, I opted to hone my skills by learning about plants. It started with growing small plants like ova (ajwain) which purifies the air and later, I thought of giving the plants I was growing to my colleagues. I began by asking the residents of my building if they were interested in such a group activity to be carried out mostly online and by following social distancing,” Dr Dixit said.“We have Basil, Aloe Vera, Wala, Paan Ova, Paan betel leaf Guduchi, Gavti chaha as well as flowering plants like Hibiscus, Mogara, Chafa, Gulab, Jaiee, Juiee, Kanher, Chinese rose, Parijatak and Gulbakshi to name a few,” she said. The highlight of Dixit’s bhishi is that the plants are free-of-cost and exchanged between the women members of the group.What started on a trial basis later brought several medicinal and kitchen plants in exchange. If this was not enough, some of the women also experimented within their homes with kitchen plants and greens such as Palak, methi, pudina, aaloooo leaf, potato, sweet potato, onion, lasun, karela and tomato.A bhishi member, Reshma Punde, resident of Treasure Park, said, “During the pandemic, I started gardening as a hobby, which helps my body and mind. It decreases the risk of depression, lowers blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Gardening is also helpful when it comes to stress. Every day, it brings me hope and positivity. Sharing ideas on how to grow and take care of plants has been a big plus of this group activity which I have experienced.”Another member, Madhuri Kolhatkar of Sainandan Apartments, said, “There is no investment as such, for we are not buying or selling but simply exchanging plants, explaining their benefits as air purifiers, and the best part is anyone can grow these plants indoors or outdoors or in shady or semi-shady places.”As part of the bhishi, women members share tips and tricks about cultivating plants, preparing compost and jiwamrut, understanding the benefits of neem as a natural fungicide, and recycling coconut leaves and plastic containers among others.“I have learned how to grow plants from cuttings using coconut shells and so on. We’ve also been drinking a lot of coconut water during the pandemic,” added Dr Dixit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/saplings-take-over-this-human-meeting-of-minds-101629996982752.html
26-08-2021||Lucknow||President Kovind says he’s hopeful that India will be a developed nation by 2047||President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday said he was hopeful that India would be a developed nation without social inequalities by 2047 when it celebrates the centenary of independence.He was addressing the ninth convocation of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University (BBAU) in Lucknow.“In 2047, when India celebrates 100 years of its Independence, I am hopeful that it will be known as a developed nation without social inequalities. I hope that India of that time would have successfully assimilated the traits of brotherhood, justice and equality in our society to become an egalitarian nation which Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar dreamed of,” the President said.He also urged students to become entrepreneurs.“I hope that all of you become job givers instead of job seekers in the future,” said the President.“Today half of the country’s population is below 25 years of age…when in 2047, we celebrate centenary of independence, you youths will be leading the country,” he said.First Lady Savita Kovind, governor Anandiben Patel and chief minster Yogi Adityanath also shared the stage with the President at the convocation event.The President praised the efforts of BBAU for providing quality education to students.“I am happy to know that the university is making efforts to provide better education facilities to students and striving to make a better society,” he said.This is the second time the President has attended the convocation of BBAU as the chief guest. He had also attended the convocation event here in 2017.President Kovind said that a study of the life and teachings of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar would be helpful in nation-building.Speaking about the National Education Policy(NEP)-2020, the President said: “The New Education Policy has been made with an aim to make the country an education superpower. The new education policy is as per the requirements and demands of the 21st century. Our aim of gaining excellence in science and technology will come true only with the efforts of teachers and students.”The President went on to praise Uttar Pradesh governor Anandiben Patel and chief minister Yogi Adityanath for including the New Education Policy in higher education institutes of the states.“Education is the best tool for social development and uplift. The efforts being made to promote education by the Uttar Pradesh government must be applauded,” said Kovind.The President also laid the foundation stone of the BBAU’s Savitri Bai Phule Girl’s Hostel.“The work done by Savitri Bai Phule towards women’s education will forever be remembered,” he said.Mentioning the efforts made by women in nation- building, the President said, “Our daughters always do better whenever they get a chance. Very often, they outperform our boys if given equal opportunities. The efforts made by our daughters in Olympics have made all of us proud.”“The everlasting dream of Babasaheb was women empowerment which seems to be coming true,” he added.The President shared an instance from the life of Ambedkar and his stress on modesty.“Babasaheb, while addressing a group of women social workers, said that we must try to make our hearts pure. Our inclination must be towards good behaviour. The modesty of men must also improve along with his education. Without modesty, education is nothing,” the President said.The President quoted Swami Vivekananda to conclude his speech: “Dare to be free, dare to go as far as your thoughts lead. Be bold, face the truth, conquer yourself and the whole universe is yours.”Earlier, Prakash C. Bartunia, the chancellor of BBAU, declared the formal opening of the convocation ceremony. It was held with a limited audience considering the Covid-19 pandemic. Vice-Chancellor Sanjay Singh welcomed the guests at the function and presented the academic report of the university, before inviting the President to the stage.On the occasion 1,424 students were given graduation, post graduation, PhD and MPhil degrees and gold medals were awarded to six of them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/president-kovind-says-he-s-hopeful-that-india-will-be-a-developed-nation-by-2047-101629996803448.html

On Wednesday IIT-Bombay signed a partnership agreement with its alumni organisations — Indian Institute of Technology Bombay Alumni Association (IITBAA) and Indian Institute of Technology Bombay Heritage Foundation (IITBHF) — to fund, design and build a new world- class hostel complex. Under this partnership agreement, IITBAA will be primarily responsible for all funding, design, construction and project management activities. Alumni will help build this hostel complex that will replace the existing site that houses H7 and H8 on IIT-Bombay campus.In a statement issued Thursday, the institute said, “IIT-Bombay reached out to its alumni to support the institute in its quest to provide world-class facilities to its students to promote the best learning environment. Responding to the request, a group of volunteers have come together for planning, fundraising, and implementation of the new hostel complex. This is the first of its kind project wherein alumni of IIT-Bombay will seek to raise ₹120-135 crore and take the lead role in project planning and implementation. The new hostel complex will come up in the old location of H8.” The institute has been facing a space crunch to house its students. In the past two decades, the number of students on campus has increased from 3,000 to over 10,000. With limited infrastructure funding and infrastructure, IIT-B has been looking to upgrade its living infrastructure. Last year, IIT-B tied up with student housing start-up, Your Space, to accommodate its students by booking 80 beds with the start-up which offers co-living spaces to students in various parts of the country. In addition to wings for male students, it will also have a wing for the growing number of women students at IIT-Bombay, the institute said. Zenobia Driver, Class of 1998, H10, said, “It is a matter of joy and pride that more and more girls are choosing STEM as their career. IIT-Bombay has undertaken several initiatives to promote gender diversity. The new hostel complex is another step in this direction”. Subhasis Chaudhuri, director of IIT-Bombay, said, “Students are the essence of all academic institutions. IIT-Bombay has been recognised as an ‘Institution of Eminence’ owing to the hard work put in by the best and brightest of the country. We strive to provide world-class learning as well as living atmosphere to our students. We are grateful to our alumni for taking the stewardship role in building the new hostel complex which is the need of the hour. IIT-Bombay sincerely thanks IITBHF and IITBAA for the roles that they have played over the years in various initiatives of the Institute”.Kirat Patel, Class of 1975 and a resident of H8, said, “IIT-Bombay’s alumni have always supported the institute’s goals and vision. We have full faith that they would come forward to help us yet again in this pioneering initiative. Together, we can create world-class hostels for our students, who are the future of our country”. DC Agrawal, Class of 1969 and President IITBHF, said, “IIT-Bombay students deserve the best facilities to compete in the current global environment. We are determined to help build a hostel complex that is consistent with IIT-Bombay’s goals of being a leading world-class Institute”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/alumni-heritage-foundation-to-raise-120-crore-to-build-new-hostel-complex-for-iit-bombay-students-101629996323464.html

Every year due to rain in August, vegetables get destroyed, but the situation is different this year so all farmers have good crops. Prices are low due to excess availability.”“Wholesale prices have dropped, as vegetable supply has increased from all parts of the district. The district has received good rainfall, so farmers have seen a good crop. The prices should drop and remain low for a few more days,” said Vilas Bhujbal, president of a body representing agents, at Market Yard.Ayaz Khan, a vegetable retail shop owner said, “People get fresh vegetables near their home so they should pay some extra money. We only charge extra as we have to take care of other expenses. Profit margin is very less for us.”“We saw news about tomatoes bought at Rs3 per kg wholesale, and being sold for Rs15 per kg, retail. A little margin is fine, but they are charging five times more,” said, Shubhangi Kelkar, a resident of Hadapsar.“Retailer have the habit crying foul in Kothrud. All the retailers in area fix a rate. You will only get to know the difference when you visit Market yard, where even the retailers sell vegetables at a lower price than here,” said, Sunita Gosavi, a resident of Kothrud.“Retailers charge extra because the count the cost of ferrying the vegetables from the Mandai market to Baner. That is their explanation,” said Megha Patil a resident from Baner.Hoteliers in the city are happy with the wholesale cost of vegetables.“We have started taking more vegetables in the last one week, as customers have started coming back in numbers. It is not the same like the pre-Covid era, but much better than what it was before the relaxations,” said Utsav Belsare, owner of Devika Hotel on Sinhgad road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/low-wholesale-veg-prices-fail-to-reach-end-user-as-retailers-look-to-cash-in-101629996262756.html
26-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body to restore yet another century-old pyaav, at Dadar||Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is set to restore yet another century-old heritage — the Vitthal Koli Pyaav, a public drinking water fountain, at Dadar. This is part of BMC’s project to restore all heritage pyaav’s in the city, that the civic body has been able to locate and create a tourism circuit of all heritage structures in the city.Around 37 to 40 pyaavs have been located across the city, and many others are lost or were demolished over the years. Of the existing pyaavs, 29 are owned by BMC. Over 20 more pyaavs will be restored by the civic bodyMany of these are seen at busy junctions and crowded public places and were a prominent source of drinking water for commuters, travellers, and animals.The restoration work includes comprehensive cleaning, repairs and restoration of the pyaav structure, providing new elements to the structure where the original ones are damaged or broken, so as to restore the look of the structure, dismantling and shifting the pyaav on the same footpath to the location decided, reinstating drinking water supply with proper plumbing and filtration systems, landscaping of the adjoining premises which includes paving, creating steps, and mural work on the wall behind the pyaav.BMC has already appointed Vaastu Vidhaan Projects as the heritage conservation architects for the project and recently invited bids to appoint a contractor for the implementation of work. Vaastu Vidhaan has helped conceptualise the design of the project, the restoration methodology, and draw up cost estimates for the project with BMC’s heritage cell.Primary estimates peg the cost of the project at ₹6,480,269, which includes the actual repair and restoration work estimated to cost ₹5,605,769, and comprehensive maintenance work for three years, according to BMCs bid document.The Anand Vitthal Koli Pyaav is located on Gokhale Road in Dadar, on the footpath outside BMC’s ward chowki. It was built in 1929 by Anand Vitthal Koli, in Malad stone, popularly used in the construction of many heritage structures across the city.Conservation Architect Rahul Chemburkar, from Vaastu Vidhaan, said, “This pyaav is not just a drinking water facility, it is an expression of architecture of its time. It has two decorative troughs for pedestrians on its two edges, and a large trough for animals at its base. One of the side troughs is now missing.” According to information from Chemburkar, the pyaav was a source of drinking water for workers in the nearby Jupiter, Shriram, and Stanrose mills, which later shut down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-restore-yet-another-century-old-pyaav-at-dadar-101629995783513.html
26-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body proposes to extend flyover to connect Link Road with WEH in Borivli||To decongest traffic around Borivli station area, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) plans to propose an extension of the under constructed 970 metres flyover between Link Road and SV Road in Borivli up to Western Express Highway (WEH). The BMC maintains that the 860 metres extension will decongest the Kora Kendra Junction that handles thousands of vehicular traffic daily.Currently, a 970-metre flyover is being constructed between Kora Kendra Junction on SV Road and Link Road. However, the BMC plans an extension up to WEH to decongest the arterial roads of Borivli.According to the plan, motorists now coming from Link Road will now be able to skip Kora Kendra Junction on SV Road as they will directly be able to head to WEH via a set of two flyovers. Due to this, the construction cost is expected to shoot up from around ₹160 crore to over ₹650 crore. Apart from extension, the BMC has also made technical changes in construction that it says has increased construction cost.The BMC says the escalation is not only due to extension but also considering the guidelines for load-bearing have been changed, mandating additional safety measures to be taken. This has increased construction costs.AV Shenoy from Mumbai Mobility Forum said, “The extension will be worth it to reduce vehicular traffic. However, if the extension does not help motorists skip the SV Road junction, the project will just mean diverting the congestion from one place to another.”However, corporators from Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have questioned the manner in which the process is being followed. Bhalchandra Shirsat, BJP corporator said, “We are not against the development, but the proper process should be followed. The BMC could have floated separate tenders for the work. We expect the BMC to come out clean on this.”Vinod Mishra, corporator and party leader of BJP in BMC said, “I am going to write to the BMC that proper process should be followed.”Ravi Raja, leader of Opposition and Congress corporator said, “We are not against the work, but the proper process should be followed. The BMC has given insufficient information to the standing committee for approval of the variation.”The BMC had tabled the proposal in the standing committee on Wednesday, but it was put on hold after opposition from the BJP and Congress. The proposal was similarly tabled two months ago in the standing committee during which it was even shot down.Meanwhile, the BMC in its justification submitted to the standing committee has said, “Despite a cost escalation of ₹490 crore, the BMC will save around ₹63 crore considering it has not tendered the additional works, rather allotted the construction to the existing contractor working on the 970 metres flyover.” This contractor BMC says has shown intention in doing the work on old rates that will help the corporation save around ₹63 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-proposes-to-extend-flyover-to-connect-link-road-with-weh-in-borivli-101629995723799.html

The Central Railway has issued 2.74 lakh passes to passengers on its mainline, harbour and trans-harbour railway lines, while the Western Railway has issued 1.11 lakh monthly season passes. The highest number of passes were issued at Dombivli and Borivli railway stations on the Central and Western Railway. The Western Railway also issued 552 monthly season passes for air-conditioned (AC) local trains.Railway officials, however, said that the number of passes issued has been less than what was anticipated earlier.“We had anticipated a higher number of passes that would be sold. After the online registration process started, it would have become smooth to apply for passengers. However, we did not witness any rise in the number of passes issued,” said a senior Central Railway officials General commuters were allowed to travel by local train after four months on August 15. Train services were suspended for the general public on April 15, due to the rise in Covid-19 cases in the city. The eligibility criterion for travelling is the completion of 14 days since receiving the second dose of Covid-19. Passengers can apply for a universal pass through online and offline systems. In the offline system, the municipal bodies have set up vaccine verification help desks outside the suburban railway stations, after verification, the passengers can get their tickets issued at the railway booking counters. Through the online system, passengers can register on http://epassmsdma.mahait.org for verification and purchase a season monthly pass from any suburban railway station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-railways-issue-3-8-lakh-passes-in-2-weeks-101629995483384.html
26-08-2021||Other||Leasing of amenity spaces: NCP’s “yes, no, maybe” forces BJP to adjourn PMC GB meet||PUNE The much-awaited general body meeting of the Pune municipal corporation on Thursday turned into a game of “noughts and crosses’, with decision made by members of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) being changed, and then, the ruling BJP having to respond. The sum total at the end of the day is that the PMC’s plan to lease out its amenity spaces has been put on hold for the time-being, at least until the next GB meet in September. The day opened with senior NCP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Vandana Chavan informing the media that the “NCP will support the proposal (leasing of amenity spaces) at the general body meeting if the ruling party accepts their (NCP’s) suggestions”. This caught the BJP by surprise as Chavan has been a most-vocal critic of the proposal. There was much discontent within the NCP ranks, post Chavan’s “we will support it” statement. It’s not clear if calls were made to NCP high command in Baramati and Mumbai, but an hour before the GB meeting was to begin, a directive was issued to all NCP elected members – proposal to lease amenity spaces was to be opposed. The BJP, caught in the crossfire, decided to adjourn the general body meeting so as to avoid having to take a decision on the proposal. Then came the explanations. NCP’s city unit president Prashant Jagtap said, “Vandana Chavan told the media that if the BJP accepts suggestions, then the party would support it. But, when we got the proposal, we found that the BJP did not keep its promise and we decided to oppose it. The NCP remains with the Maha Vikas Aghadi on the issue.” MVA alliance members treaded carefully. Congress leader Aba Bagul and Shiv Sena leader Prithviraj Sutar issued a joint statement that read: “We took a stand to oppose the proposal from day one and remained firm. BJP leaders approached us and tried to convince us, but we remained firm.” BJP leader of the house Ganesh Bidkar said, “We are firm on the proposal. As the mayor’s relative passed away, we postponed the general body meeting. It is well if the NCP comes with us, otherwise the BJP has the numbers to pass proposal. We will give it the nod at the next meeting. “With a decision on the controversial proposal postponed, citizen activist and NGOs all opposing the proposal will have more time to ensure that no matter who wins the “noughts and crosses” poltical game, the city’s amenity spaces will not be leased. Several important decisions have now also been delayed due to the PMC’s general body meeting being adjourned on Thursday. Decisions on charging stations for e-vehicles, the Katraj Metro route, and the sale of apartments owned by the PMC will also have to wait for the next GB in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/leasing-of-amenity-spaces-ncp-s-yes-no-maybe-forces-bjp-to-adjourn-pmc-gb-meet-101629995062667.html
26-08-2021||Other||IISER Pune develops sustainable chemical manufacturing method for iGEM competition||PUNE: A team of undergraduate students of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune has carried out research for the prestigious iGEM (Internationally Genetically Engineered Machine) competition - an annual competition where student teams from across the globe work to solve real-world problems using synthetic biology. Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to create novel biological systems or redesign existing ones using engineering principles.The IISER team’s work involves developing an alternative method for chemical manufacturing that does not depend on fossil fuels and does not produce any new carbon emissions. The team is developing this idea in line with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals - climate action, clean energy, and sustainable production.Likhith Chandragiri, a member of the team, said, “Carbon dioxide concentration levels in the atmosphere are higher now than at any other time in human history, and they are only projected to rise due to human activities. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, which plays a crucial role in regulating the surface temperature of the planet.”“As it continues to accumulate, it leads to a net increase in average global surface temperatures. We are already experiencing the effects of climate change due to global warming - from more extreme rainfall, drought, cyclones and wildfires to the extinction of numerous plant and animal species. If global warming continues unabated, it spells truly catastrophic effects on humanity and the natural world,” Chandragiri said.The IISER team is developing a solution to tackle a major source of carbon emissions - the use of fossil fuels to generate industrial chemicals like fuels, plastics, pharmaceuticals, synthetic fabrics, etc. These chemicals are principally made of carbon, which is sourced from coal and crude oil as raw materials. Inevitably, some of this carbon is lost into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide gas. The students aim to create a sustainable alternative method for chemical manufacturing that does not depend on fossil fuels and does not produce any new carbon emissions. Their two-step technique first traps some of the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere photosynthetically to generate renewable carbon reserves; and then produces chemicals from these reserves.Another member, Misaal Bedi, explained, “Each step is facilitated by a genetically engineered species of bacteria. The carbon dioxide is taken up by Synechococcus Elongatus, which belongs to a group of photosynthetic bacteria called cyanobacteria. The stored carbon is recycled by the microbiologist’s favourite, Escherichia Coli. To avoid any wasteful extra steps, the two will be grown in the same vessel. The cyanobacteria will be genetically modified to continually fix carbon dioxide as sucrose (table sugar) and to secrete it out. E. Coli will be engineered to be capable of consuming this sucrose and converting it into chemicals such as Butanol, a biofuel.”The team envisions their co-culture system as a sort of microbial cell factory which can sustainably produce industrial chemicals from light and carbon dioxide. Switching one strain of E. Coli with another appropriately modified strain will allow one to switch which final product one wishes to manufacture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/iiser-pune-develops-sustainable-chemical-manufacturing-method-for-igem-competition-101629994762587.html

My aim is to take the number to 1.40 lakh,” Kumar said.The chief minister emphasises the role of female police officers in enforcing Prohibition, which his government imposed in the state in April 2016 to ban sale and consumption of liquor. “It was the women again on whose demand I imposed Prohibition in Bihar. Some people are still involved in doing mischief and the noose has to be tightened around them,” he said.Kumar urged female cadets to focus on protecting women and children. Police academy’s director, additional general of police Bhrigu Sriniwasan, said the 2018-batch of 1,596 sub-inspector who entered active duty today had received extensive institutional training in cyber crime, crowd management, ATM cloning, bank fraud, human rights, drugs and special training for Prohibition at the academy for the first time after the bifurcation of Bihar. Before Bihar’s bifurcation in 2000, training for Bihar police was held at police academy at Padma in Hajaribagh (now in Jharkahnd). The 1994-batch of 1400 sub-inspectors trained at Chandigarh in Punjab and at Padma while 2009-batch SIs trained at Nathnagar constable school in Bhagalpur.Speaking at the Rajgir academy on the occasion on Thursday, Bihar’s director general of police Sanjiv Kumar Singhal said most of new officers came from villages and remote districts of the state and they would help in crime control and addressing grievances of the needy. The last police recruitment was in 2009, when around 2,100 sub-inspectors were inducted. In 1994, the passing out parade for 1400 probationer sub-inspectors was held at Gandhi Maidan in Patna, where the chief guest was Lalu Prasad, the then chief minister of undivided Bihar, which then included the present day Jharkhand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/596-women-among-1-582-new-sub-inspectors-in-bihar-police-101629994584508.html

Under the regional connectivity scheme UDAN, financial incentives from the Centre, state governments and airport operators are extended to select airlines to encourage operations from unserved and underserved airports, and keep airfares affordable.Purnia has an Indian Air Force base, whose airport’s runway length (11,000 X 150 feet) is approximately same as in Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Mangalore, but the Airport Authority of India (AAI) has asked for an additional 50 acres of land for a civil enclave, approach road and modernization of the airport, officials said. The land acquisition is already in progress and the government has already released over ₹20 crore towards compensation, district officials said. “Some landowners, while objecting to the land acquisition, filed a case at Patna high court creating a hurdle,” a senior district official, unwilling to ben named, said.The Indian Air Force station in Purnia, spread over 700 acres, was established in 1963, a year after the Indo-China war. In his letter to Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, the Union minister also underscored the land requirement of 49.5 acres at the Patna airport for runway extension and other works, 121 acres at Raxaul to develop the airport for ATR72 type of aircraft, 475 acres at Muzaffarpur airport to develop it for operation of A320 type of aircraft, 78 acres at Darbhanga for development of new civil enclave along with a new light system.He also requested Kumar to consider the provision of 100 per cent viability gap funding support for commencing international UDAN flights from Patna and Gaya (Gaya-Bangkok, Gaya-Kathmandu, Gaya-Yangon, Patna-Kathmandu and Patna-Dubai).“On receipt of the consent of the state government for 100 per cent viability gap funding support, routes will be put for bidding (under the UDAN scheme) for the airlines,” the MoCA mentioned.Contacted for his response, Sanjay Kumar, Bihar’s additional chief secretary (cabinet secretariat) said, “We haven’t received the letter as yet.”Headline: Delhi’s demandIntro: Besides land, civil aviation ministry has demanded money into Regional Air Connectivity Fund Trust and viability gap funding support for international UDAN flight operationsAirport: Land requirementPurnia: 50 acres for civil enclave at Indian Air Force basePatna: 49.5 acres for runway extension, other amenities Raxaul: 121 acres to develop the airport for ATR72 type of aircraftDarbhanga: 78 acres for new civil enclave, new light systemMuzaffarpur: 475 acres develop the airport for operation of A320 aircraft||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/scindias-letter-to-cm-revives-hopes-for-five-airports-101629994583334.html

A snag in one of the two billing servers on July 30 has not only crippled generation of energy bills, but also disrupted online payments partially. A team of software engineers from New Delhi have been camping here for the last three weeks as they grapple to fix the bug, which has hit both the discoms in the state — the north and the south Bihar power distribution companies limited (NBPDCL & SBPDCL). “We expect to rectify the snag this week and shall resume generation of energy bills from September 1,” said Sanjiwan Sinha, managing director of the SBPDCL. “Online payments are now possible, allowing consumers to make advance payment, which they were unable to do earlier. The advance amount will be adjusted against their next energy bill, after the problem is resolved,” said Sinha. The engineers have been able to fix the problem only partially. Online advance payments through mobile applications — Suvidha and Bihar Bijli Bill Pay — are still not possible. Online bill payment through the portal of the two discoms is also not fully functional. The payment portal of the two discoms has not been updated. As a result, it shows arrears in case of many consumers who have already paid their bills for June. “The SBPDCL portal showed an outstanding amount of ₹3,100 (approx.) for June despite the fact that I had paid my energy bill on July 8, well before the payment due date of July 23,” said Sushant Kumar, a domestic subscriber (consumer account number 101004351) of New Patliputra Colony in Patna. Suresh Narayan Lall, a retired electrical engineer and domestic subscriber (consumer account number 101109023), residing at Patna’s Bahadurpur Housing Colony, said the SBPDCL portal showed an arrear of ₹1,300 (approx.) against his energy bill generated in June that he had already paid. Kumar and Lall were able to make advance payment of of ₹5001 and ₹5,000, respectively, through the SBPDCL portal on Wednesday. Dr Sandeep Sen of Sen Diagnostics, however, wasn’t lucky enough. He was unable to pay advance money through the SBPDCL portal for the three energy metres (consumer numbers 100841141, 100833773 and 100842272) installed on his premises at Patna’s Budh Marg, under the New Dak Bungalow electrical division of the Patna Electrical Supply Undertaking. “I have been trying repeatedly for the last one week but am unable to make an advance lump-sum payment for my energy bill of July. I get different messages on the portal. Initially, it said ‘error retrieving bill details, please try again’. Today, it said the consumer number is not registered with the SBPDCL,” said Dr Sen. The NBPDCL and the SBPDCL, however, claimed that payments were smooth through their respective portals. “Total 194 (online) payments were received today till now. Team is constantly monitoring the same,” read a text message from a senior officer in the NBPDCL. Payment collection data till 1pm on Wednesday, shared by another senior officer in the SBPDCL, claimed 2,053 online transactions led to realisation of ₹30.79 lakh in urban areas while 5,894 transactions led to remittance of ₹73.30 lakh in rural areas. Chaturbhuj Mishra, SBPDCL chief data based administrator, the officer tasked to resolve the crisis and facing the heat for delay, did not respond phone calls and text messages. SBPDCL managing director, however, allayed fears of delayed payment surcharge being levied for late payment of energy bills for previous months during the period of the snag. “The bill pay-by-date has been extended till August 31 for consumers whose payment due date was between July 30 and August 15. They will also be allowed rebate for timely payment, which will reflect in their next energy bill. All adjustments will be done in the next bill of consumers who have paid in excess of the billed amount,” said Sinha. The snag has affected around 7 lakh power consumers under the NBPDCL and 11 lakh under the SBPDCL across 63 towns in 35 of the 38 districts of Bihar, excluding Muzaffarpur, Gaya and Bhagalpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/delay-by-discoms-in-fixing-snag-worries-power-consumers-in-bihar-101629994527510.html

The party also appointed Member of Parliament (MP) Geeta Kora, legislator Bandhu Tirkey, Jaleshwar Mahto and Shahzada Anwar as working presidents of the state unit. While a majority of party leaders, including ministers and legislators, congratulated the new appointees, a section in the party started raising questions over the choice of working presidents by the central leadership, saying that at least three of the four working presidents joined the party in the past couple of years. While Geeta Kora, wife of former chief minister Madhu Koda, had joined the party ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Jaleshwar Mahto, former minister and ex-president of Jharkhand JD(U), joined the party ahead of the 2019 assembly polls and contested unsuccessfully from his traditional seat Baghmara. Mandar legislator and former minister Bandhu Tirkey joined the Congress after 2019 assembly polls following a split in his party JVM (P) and is facing an anti-defection complaint being heard by the Speaker. “Though they might be political heavyweights in their own pockets, they are new to the party. There were many deserving candidates, including senior party workers, who were deserving but have been sidelined. Whether they would be able to draw support of the rank and file is very difficult to say, especially when most of the Congress ministers and several legislators are senior to them,” a senior party leader said. Jharkhand Congress spokesperson Alok Dubey, who was close to the outgoing president Rameshwar Oraon, even questioned the choice of president Rajesh Thakur saying the party should have stuck with a tribal face. “Rameshwar Oraon was the tribal face of the party under whose leadership party won a historic number of seats in 2019 assembly polls. Will Thakur be able to catch tribal votes for the party?” added Dubey. Thakur was one of the five working presidents of the party in Jharkhand, besides being the media in charge of the state unit since ahead of the 2019 assembly polls. Before that, he was a state spokesperson. Another Jharkhand spokesperson M Tauseef backed the new appointments while calling Thakur an “energetic and dynamic party worker.” “He worked hard both as working president and media in-charge and helped a great deal in building the narrative against the then BJP government. And as far as the tag of outsiders is concerned, those raising such questions now never spoke about it when these people had joined the party and also contested in Lok Sabha and assembly election. They are very much a Congressmen now and have been appointed by the party president,” Tauseef added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/thakur-appointed-as-new-j-khand-cong-chief-choice-of-working-presidents-raises-eyebrows-101629994524460.html

There are six districts in the division and people from Bihar and West Bengal would also benefit after the establishment of AIIMS at Deoghar. Therefore, a Scheduled Tribe (ST) special treatment ward should be established there so that tribals could benefit from it as they have remained undeveloped even 7-8 decades after the independence,” read Das’ letter to the PM and the health minister.When asked if he was demanding some sort of reservation for a particular community in health service, Das said it should not be seen with the prism of quota.“All political parties demand welfare and development of vulnerable groups, including the poor, Dalits and the tribals. My only intention is to seek better healthcare for the tribals in the region,” Das said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/deoghar-aiims-bjp-mla-demands-exclusive-treatment-ward-for-tribals-101629994523420.html

The VC have a detailed presentation on the measures the varsity had taken to generate income from its own resources. According to budgetary proposals for this fiscal year, the varsity expects to generate an annual income of ₹342 crore, including government aid. With the expenditure, however, at ₹472, the university has to bridge a fiscal deficit of ₹130 crore. At the moment, the varsity is toiling hard to meet its mostly fixed and committed expenditure, including payment of salaries and pensions to its employees, on time. V-C Arvind said, “We have informed them that the university has taken key steps, including restructuring and rationalization of staff in external centres, 10% increase in fee, starting new courses and other related measures to generate income of its own.”He added that the government was also apprised about recent actions taken against those who were involved in financial irregularities. “The minister gave a patient hearing to our presentation. Now, we want the government to look into the issue of our finances and decide positively on providing financial assistance to the institution,” he added. Recently, a five-member committee had been formed under the varsity’s finance officer Rakesh Kumar to prepare detail report on its finances and how it could be improved.“We informed the government about the gap between income and expenditure and how it could be bridged,” the V-C added. Meanwhile, an official present at the meeting said discussions were also held on increasing the varsity’s monthly grant to ₹25 crore from the present ₹12 crore. The government has also been briefed in a debt of ₹120 crore that the varsity has taken from banks to meet its monthly expenditure. On March 8, the Punjab government had come to the rescue of cash-strapped varsity with its announcement of a special grant of ₹90 crore in its annual budget. The varsity has already received the first instalment of ₹27 crore of this money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjabi-university-v-c-meets-manpreet-on-financial-crisis-ailing-varsity-101629993805232.html

A video of his statement had gone viral on social media. Jalandhar rural SSP Naveen Singla said, “A case has been registered against Maan and investigation is on.” On August 24, Maan had posted a video on social media, offering an apology for his statement made during the annual mela at Dera Murad Shah in Nakodar. “Gurus should never be compared with anyone and I can never even think about insulting the great gurus. If my words have hurt anyone’s sentiments, I apologise to them a 100 times,” Maan, who is also the chairman of Dera Murad Shah, says in this video. Sikh organisations, including members of the Satkar Committee, had lodged a police complaint and sought a case against Maan. Members of these organisations had also started an indefinite protest against Jalandhar police opposite the SSP office for the past four days. On Thursday, Sikh protesters upped the ante and gathered at the Rama Mandi Chowk on the Jalandhar-Ludhiana national highway and blocking traffic. It was then that the police lodged the FIR and got protesters to clear the highway. Maan has been booked under Sections 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings) of the Indian Penal Code at Nakodar City police station in the district. Maan had also courted controversy after in 2019, after he supported the idea of ‘One Nation, One Language’ for the country in a radio talk-show in Canada and faced protests from a section of Punjabi community, during his live show in Canada. A senior Punjabi writer, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Gurdas Maan did not compare anyone with the guru. The issue is being blown out of proportion, even as Maan has tendered an apology. Even otherwise, many sections of society openly claim to be the descendants of the gurus or Sikh warriors. They are never booked.” Noted writer Gurbhajan Gill said, “Celebrities should be vigilant of what they say. Promoting dera chiefs etc is not their brief.” Nakodar dera management refused to comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jalandhar-police-book-singer-gurdas-maan-for-hurting-religious-sentiments-101629990923166.html

Later his custody was handed over to the NIA, as the latter took over the case from ATS.In his bail plea, filed in April through the law firm Diamondwala & Co, Gaur had claimed that he has been made a scapegoat by the investigating agency at the instance of co-accused dismissed Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze. He claimed that he was never contacted by Vaze.The plea was opposed by NIA claiming that Gaur was part of the larger conspiracy hatched by dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze, a prime accused in the case, to eliminate Hiran, along with other Mumbai police officers Sunil Mane and Riyazuddin Kazi - both of whom are also arrested by NIA and subsequently dismissed from service, and former policeman Vinayak Shinde. NIA claimed that the SIM cards used by Vaze were provided by Gaur and also the mobile phone used for calling Hiran was purchased by Vaze, in which the SIM inserted was also provided by Gaur. Further, the agency claimed that if released on bail, Gaur may jump the bail and tamper with evidence.On February 25, a green Mahindra Scorpio was found abandoned near billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Antilia, on Carmichael Road in south Mumbai, with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a note threatening to kill certain members of the Ambani family.On March 5, the body of the SUV owner, Thane based auto parts dealer Mansukh Hiran, was found dumped in a creek at Reti Bunder near Mumbra.NIA subsequently took over investigations in both the cases and claimed that it was all handy work of Vaze, out of purported desperation to “restore his lost glory.”NIA later also arrested encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma and four others who allegedly throttled Hiran and dumped the body in the creek.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/antilia-explosives-scare-nia-court-rejects-naresh-gor-s-bail-plea-101629983662697.html

Based on tapped telephonic conversations, the report highlights how certain persons were acting as conduits, helping many senior police officers to secure transfers and lucrative postings using their political connections.The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar was hearing the application by CBI seeking documents which included the letter submitted by Shukla to the director-general of police and a report on the transfer and postings. The CBI had also sought copies of the annexures to the report and digital devices and panchnama which showed how the documents had been transferred from one department to another. Senior advocate Rafiq Dada, who appeared for the state government, submitted that as per the assurance given to the bench on Monday, the state had agreed to hand over documents, annexures to the documents and digital devices sought by CBI by August 31.Dada, however, added that the state would not be able to provide certified copies of the panchnama and was not in a position to respond to the query of CBI as to the number of copies made of the annexures and the digital devices as the same was not known. It was also submitted that the panchnama was not required in the Deshmukh probe. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh appearing for CBI submitted the panchnama was sought only to ascertain the chain of events showing handing over of documents. After hearing and recording the submissions, the court observed that such issues should not come before the court. “In many occasions, the state and CBI share (document and information) especially on intra-state issues, crime spread over other states. Both CBI or you (state agencies) need to co-operate with each other,” said the bench. The court noted that after the state had challenged certain portions of the CBI FIR filed on April 21, the HC had dismissed the challenge through its July 22 order and the Apex court had also upheld the HC decision. In light of this, the court said that it was necessary for the officers to comply with court orders in letter and spirit and also told chief public prosecutor Aruna Pai to ensure that no unfavourable situation was created which could compel the court to take officers to the task.On the issue of the panchnama the court said that it would see the petitions of both the CBI and the state government and pass appropriate orders on September 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rashmi-shukla-report-maharashtra-govt-assures-hc-to-hand-over-documents-to-cbi-by-aug-31-101629981742666.html

After the decision, the two institutes would now be known as Kalyan Singh Rajkiya Medical College, Bulandshahr and Kalyan Singh super speciality cancer institute, Chak Ganjaria, Lucknow,” officers at the chief minister’s office confirmed. The officers said the UP chief minister took the decision, keeping in view Kalyan Singh’s focus on works of public welfare.Only recently Kalyan Singh’s son Rajveer, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Etah, had praised Adityanath for being with his father’s mortal remains for three days, escorting them from Lucknow to Aligarh, Atrauli and Narora on the banks of the Ganga where the last rites of the late leader were performed. “He acted like my father’s eldest son,” Rajveer said in praise of Yogi Adityanath.The state’s deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya has already announced the naming of roads across the state after the late leader who was the torchbearer of the Ram temple movement that propelled the BJP’s rise to power. “We have decided to name roads at all those places that were associated with him (Kalyan Singh) after him. He was a hero of the temple movement and hence the road leading to the Ram temple would be named after him. He served as UP chief minister twice and lived in Lucknow. Hence, a road in Lucknow would be named after him. Etah, Bulandshahr, Atrauli and Prayagraj were places connected with him and hence roads there too would be named after him,” Maurya said. The UP BJP unit is holding meetings across the state in memory of Kalyan Singh.“He was a great leader, a visionary and hence he will live on in popular memory forever,” said UP BJP leader Tarun Kant Tripathi.Since Singh’s death, the BJP has targeted Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav for not arriving to pay his last respects to the departed leader and alleged that it was due to vote bank considerations. The SP has hit back at the BJP for trying to do politics even in the death of a leader. In AMU, some protesters put up posters against their vice chancellor professor Tariq Mansoor on Monday night (August 23) for condoling the demise of Kalyan Singh who, they alleged, was responsible for the demolition of the Babri mosque.UP ministers have condemned the act of the protestors and sought action against them.In September 2020, a special CBI court acquitted Kalyan Singh and all the 31 others, including BJP veterans LK Advani and MM Joshi, who were accused of conspiracy to demolish the mosque. The judge concluded that there was no evidence to show that the demolition was pre-planned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-govt-names-two-medical-institutes-in-lucknow-bulandshahr-after-kalyan-singh-101629981082534.html

Originally from south Kashmir’s Khrew, her family shifted to Srinagar over two decades ago. Her mother, Dilshada Banday, is a retired government teacher and father Dr Saqlain Masoodi a retired law professor. It was her parents, particularly her mother, who encouraged her to help people in distress. She was pursuing engineering at the local SSM College in early 2000 when she decided to course correct. “I had taken the eighth semester exam, but I wasn’t comfortable. My heart lay elsewhere,” she says, adding she did not return to college even to collect her degree. Instead, she went to look after children in orphanages in town. Initially, she would take along small gifts for the inmates but the pain in their eyes moved her to do something substantial. To the rescue of orphans During her visits, Qurat found that children of some orphanages were facing abuse and she started highlighting their plight. “I was threatened with dire consequences and warned that being a young woman, this could become dangerous. But I continued raising the concern till the government closed all orphanages where children were being exploited,” she says. The focus of her work in orphanages has been the mental health of the children. “I started a scholarship programme for orphaned students in January 2018. My organisation, Aash (Hope), offers free education, meals, books and uniforms to 50 needy students,” she says. Hosting mass marriages Gradually, Qurat found herself travelling to remote pockets of Kashmir, where people, particularly women, needed a helping hand out of poverty. Aash, which she set up a decade ago, has so far solemnised weddings of 300 couples at mass marriages. “I make all arrangements for the mass marriages after raising funds from friends and acquaintances,” she says, adding that the focus of her foundation was Khansahib in Budgam district as a majority of people there lived below the poverty line. “I’ve been working for improving the lot of women of underprivileged sections. In the first of its kind mass marriage in Kashmir Valley more than 50 women were married off in October 2018,” she says. The total number of marriages supported by Aash has crossed 250, she says, adding her aim is to help families that don’t have resources to organise weddings. “Some parents say they have no option but to sell their land or household items to arrange the wedding. And a majority have small portions of land, so Aash stepped in,” she says. Though mass marriages are suspended these days due to the Covid pandemic, she recalls arranging khewa and biryani instead of the traditional Wazwan, where a lavish lunch or dinner is served to guests. “Rather, we gift clothes and household items to the newlyweds,” she adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kashmiri-social-worker-qurat-ul-ain-masoodi-follows-her-heart-to-offer-hope-serve-a-cause-101629980302442.html

AAP workers gathered at Buddha Park here under the leadership of AAP city president Dimple Pandey, where they made jalebis and fed them to the public. Dimple Pandey said the BJP’s Central and state governments have been making false promises to the public for the past several years. “They promised to provide jobs to the youth. But the reality is that unemployment is at its peak. ‘Achhe din (good days)’ were promised, but in reality, due to price hike of domestic gas, petrol and diesel, inflation has made life difficult for the common people,” he said. “So, we thought of making jalebis of such promises and feed people. This is a symbolic way of registering our protest against the BJP for not fulfilling the promises it had made,” he said Pandey alleged that BJP’s Central and state governments have failed on every front. “Now the public is also fed up with the ‘jumlebaazi’ (tall claims and mere statements) and will teach a lesson to the BJP in the upcoming assembly elections,” he added. BJP district president Pradeep Bisht said the AAP doesn’t know the ground reality of Uttarakhand. “They are just doing drama. Everyone knows where they stand here. The are desperate to come into the spotlight.

26-08-2021||Delhi||Butterfly pea powder: Paint your plate blue||We eat with our eyes first and something that looks appealing to the eye ignites the appetite. Butterfly pea powder is among the top beverage trends of 2019 and has been ruling the internet since then with its distinctive blue hue. It comes from a deep blue flowering plant called Clitoria ternatea. This magical flower has anti-cancer, anti-tumor and anti-asthmatic properties. It is also beneficial for hair loss, depression and hypertension.Its usage began with tea drinks, cocktails, lemonade and gradually took over desserts, blue rice, smoothies, pasta, unicorn noodles and much more. Though the powder is not a common ingredient in the Indian kitchen, some chefs love to experiment with it. “We were taught in hospitality school that blue is not a food colour, but food takes us to school every day. My romance with butterfly has been a recent one, and I fell head over heels. My food philosophy is collaborative and butterfly pea flower is a perfect fit with my style of cooking. Primarily used as special tea rich with oxidants, butterfly pea flower is slowly entering the kitchen of professional chefs. Butterfly pea flower is used for its pretty blue color and for dyeing food items,” says chef Tarun Sibal. It’s always better to use natural colours on food items. Unlike any other product, Butterfly pea powder allows chefs to add a deep blue on a plate without compromising on taste and nutrition. “People love good looking dishes but they are also conscious of what they eat. Butterfly pea powder is a natural ingredient and gained major popularity in the last two years as it is naturally blue and retains colour once treated well,” says chef Nishant Choubey. Sharing his experience of using it, he adds, “It’s simply outstanding! From iced tea to ice pop to bread to spaghetti to fried rice, I have been able to curate an entire menu based on this amazing flower. Having its base in Vietnam, it’s highly versatile and extremely fun to use.”The ingredient has hidden magical properties. It can change its colour when used with specific products. “A drop of lime in blue tea can change its colour from blue to purple. Add any acidic elements like lime or vinegar and see the magic unfolds,” says Choubey.The powder gives a fancy, aesthetic and rich look to the food item and can totally be used in the Indian kitchen. “From making momos, I consider momos Indian, to having a pretty looking kebab or having a floral biryani, butterfly pea flower could be used across the board. I use it for making jam, jelly with coconut milk, steam rice, or just a simple tempura, having said that I have also started using this behind the bar for infusing cocktails,” says Sibal.Chef Juhi Pahwa, who is very conscious of the ingredients she uses in her kitchen, loves to bring it to her menu.

The speed limit will surely help in the protection of wildlife...” said Dhurb Singh Martolia, sub-divisional officer, Terai central forest division, Rudrapur. “If trains run within the speed limit, elephants can cross the track safely or loco pilots can reduce the speed or apply the brakes for the crossing of elephant conveniently.”Also Read | Kids in Pithoragarh risk their lives, cross a swollen river to reach schoolTrain services were halted for around five hours after the elephant and her calf were killed on the Lalkuan-Kashipur route.“Order for the speed limit for the trains in Kumaon has already been issued. Now we are implementing it,” said Rajendra Singh, a railway public relations officer.At least seven elephants have been killed on railways tracks in the state since April 2017. In August 2018, the Uttarakhand high court directed the railway ministry to construct underpasses in the identified elephant corridors in the state. It added the speed of the trains should the lowest possible while they are passing through elephant corridors while expressing concern over the death of elephants on railway tracks.The state has recorded a 29.9% increase in the number of elephants since 2015.

Bureaucrat explains what happened||In the latest images going viral on social media, senior Uttar Pradesh IAS officer Akhilesh Mishra is seen “selling” vegetables by the roadside. The images show, Mishra, a special secretary in the state transport department, seated on what looks like a sack, with a variety of vegetables laid out in front of him. The photos seem to be from a busy roadside market as other vegetable sellers and customers can also be seen.Netizens are wondering if these are genuine or fake. Now, Mishra himself has come forward to clarify that while the images are indeed genuine, what people see is, of course, not what was actually happening. The IAS officer took to Facebook to explain what led to the now-viral photographs.“Yesterday, I visited Prayagraj for some official work. While on my way back, I stopped at a place to take a look at the vegetables. The vegetable seller, an old lady, requested me to look after her shop, saying she would be back in a moment. Possibly, she had gone to look for her child who had gone away from the shop,” a rough translation of the post, shared in Hindi, read.Mishra added, “I just sat down at her shop. Suddenly a customer and the seller came. A friend of mine took the photo and put it on my Facebook account from my phone. I saw these today itself. For your kind information….”Since being uploaded, these have been seen by several users on the social media platform.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/did-up-ias-officer-sell-vegetables-by-roadside-bureaucrat-explains-what-happened-101629977477522.html

26-08-2021||Pune||Taste of Life: Vegetarian messengers and the ‘no three Fs’ diet plan||I am sitting inside the semi-circular hall of the bright red, old building of the Connemara Public Library in Chennai one February morning, wishing that it was a bit cooler inside. The library staff has taken my reference receipts inside to get the books for me. In the meantime, I have been craning my neck to get an eyeful of the intricate designs on the roof of the main hall. That part of the old building is not accessible to visitors.I am there that day to read the issues of “The Dietetic Reformer and Vegetarian Messenger”. The magazine was started in 1861 by the Vegetarian Society which had its headquarters in Manchester. Established in 1847, the objects of the Society were to “induce habits of abstinence from the Flesh of Animals as Food, by the dissemination of information upon the subject, by means of tracts, essays, and lectures, proving the many advantages of a physical, intellectual, and moral character, resulting from Vegetarian habits of Diet”.The Society had a branch in Calcutta which was run by Baboo Keshub Chandra Sen, one of the most influential and prominent social reformers in 19th century Bengal. According to the September 1885 issue of “The Dietetic reformer”, a branch was opened in Bombay that year of which Mr Byramjee Panday was the chairman.The magazine makes an interesting read. Almost all the articles preach the virtues of a vegetarian diet and urge the readers to abstain from three Fs – Fish, Flesh, and Fowl. Most of the articles are argumentative, yet eloquent.While I am a little overwhelmed by the huge stack of magazines on my desk, in one of the issues I find some handwritten pamphlets and notes. All of them are signed as “JM Lane, Poona”. Some have dates on them, many don’t.The first pamphlet bears the date 23/8/1885. It says – “During the past twelve months four – entirely Vegetarian restaurants – have been opened in London, and at least three other dining – rooms have undertaken to provide Vegetarian meals. Manchester has seen the establishment of two new restaurants, and one has opened in Leeds. I urge the members to start a Vegetarian restaurant each in Bombay, Poona and Mahabaleshwar.”This pamphlet seems to be meant for private circulation of an organisation, because it is clearly addressed to “members”, perhaps of the “Vegetarian Society”.Another interesting pamphlet was probably written to convey a decision taken collectively in a meeting, or by Mr Lane himself - “A Vegetarian badge, for which many friends have been so anxiously waiting, has been decided upon in the form of a narrow silk ribbon, with a red center, narrow gold lines on either side and blue margins. This badge may be worn by all Vegetarians, its signification being simply that the wearer is an abstainer from fish, flesh, and fowl. By the general use of this badge, especially at festivals and meetings, Vegetarian friends will be able to recognise each other, while it will frequently afford an excellent opportunity for introducing the subject to the notice of others.” It is neither dated nor addressed to anyone in particular.The other pamphlets have appeals to come up with innovative vegetarian recipes, to preach vegetarianism during the Sunday mass, to meet medical practitioners and sell them on the idea of giving up meat, to visit hospitals and explain to the patients the benefits of a plant-based diet. Then there are a couple of notes which request the “presence of members at the residence of JM Lane in Civil Lines, Wanowrie” on certain Wednesday evenings from 1891 to 1893.“The Dietetic Reformer” mentions in August 1885 that Lane published “a useful pamphlet in Poona”. There are no other mentions of him or the city again in the magazine. This means that Lane was affiliated with the Vegetarian Society from Manchester. But, did he start a branch in Poona, or was he associated with the one in Bombay? In what capacity did he convene meetings at his residence in Poona?I dig a little in the hope that I find answers and come across a report published in “The Bombay Gazette” on September 10, 1891. On September 6, Sunday, a meeting was held in Church Gate Street, Bombay. One Mr Gostling took the chair. In his opening address, he mentioned that he had personal experience of the advantages of natural living, which had cured him of the chronic dyspepsia from which he had suffered for over twelve years. Dr Daji then moved the resolution referring to the formation of a “Vegetarian Society”. He said that the Vegetarian Society at Manchester had repeatedly requested their friends in Bombay to form a similar organisation in Bombay “that would find work to do in educating the native vegetarians in the land in the physiology of digestion and the chemistry of food”.The chairman then declared that the society would be called “The Natural Living Vegetarian Society”, so as to “guard against the misconception that vegetarians had to live upon vegetables alone”.The report ends with a quote from Gostling – “The admirers of British rule were not right in attributing the success of the British Army to their eating beef since the poor Irishmen and Scotch men who form the bulk of the army were brought up from childhood on potatoes and oatmeal respectively.”This report suggests that the branch of the Vegetarian Society opened in 1885 in Bombay was short-lived and that another was started in 1891.What interests me is the revelation that the last quote by Gostling is replicated verbatim in one of the notes written in Lane’s handwriting. This means that he was either present at the meeting in Bombay, or he copied it from the newspaper to use it later.Lane and his pamphlets have remained a mystery to me after I first saw them three years ago. How the pamphlets ended up in the Chennai library, is another question. He probably shifted there from Poona. Or the pamphlets were brought there by another member of the Vegetarian Society. I have found no mention of Lane in the newspapers or magazines published from London, Manchester, Bombay, Poona, and Madras. Yet his pamphlets tell us that he kept championing the cause of vegetarianism till 1893 at least.I hope to find out more about JM Lane someday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/taste-of-life-vegetarian-messengers-and-the-no-three-fs-diet-plan-101629975082314.html
26-08-2021||Mumbai||Monkeys continue to meet with accidents on Mumbai-Goa highway||Despite the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) building a ladder type bridge for monkeys to cross the Mumbai-Goa highway at the Karnala bird sanctuary stretch, there is no end to monkeys meeting with accidents here. Forest officials say monkeys continue to gather at the highway, lured by food offered by some motorists. They also estimate that at least four monkey ladders and road rumblers were needed on the 2 km stretch passing through the park to contain the problem.A monkey from the Karnala bird sanctuary suffered severe injuries after it was hit by a vehicle on the highway on August 21. The animals in the sanctuary, located around 10 km from Panvel city, often go to the jungle on the other side by crossing the highway. Keeping this in mind, NHAI installed a ladder across the highway for the monkeys in July.“While writing to NHAI, we did not mention the number of ladders required in the area, assuming they will conduct surveys and decide the numbers on their own. However, they installed only one ladder near the entrance of the sanctuary and hence monkeys in other areas of the park are still crossing the highway like earlier,” a forest official said.The official said that speeding vehicles were another reason for the accidents on this stretch. “In an effort to ensure that vehicles do not go fast in this area, we have written three letters to NHAI requesting them to put rumblers on the stretch. However, they have not done anything in that regard so far,” he said.Prashant Fegade, project director of NHAI (Panvel division) said, “We developed the monkey ladder near the sanctuary after requests from the forest department. But, I don’t know anything about the requests made for rumblers. If we receive requests from them for rumblers or some more monkey ladders, we will think it over.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/monkeys-continue-to-meet-with-accidents-on-mumbai-goa-highway-101629974242545.html
26-08-2021||Mumbai||Mastermind among the two arrested for Thane jeweller’s murder||Maharashtra Police have arrested the main accused in the murder of Thane based jeweller Bharat Jain. 25-year old Atul Mishra, arrested on Wednesday night, used to work as a watchman in Jain’s housing complex and used his knowledge of Jain’s daily routine to hatch a plot to murder and rob him with help from the other accused, police said.Jain, who stayed with his family near the Makhmali Talao in Thane, went missing on August 14 and his body was found floating in the Mumbra-Retibandar creek on August 19. Police last week arrested Subhash Surve (39) and Balwant Cholekar (36) in connection with the killing. Surve is an Ola Cab driver and was allegedly driving the vehicle used in Jain’s kidnapping, while Cholekar is alleged to have helped the other accused flee the city.Naupada police arrested Mishra and Nilesh Bhoir (35) on Wednesday night.They said Mishra, who used to work as watchman at Jain’s residential complex about two-and-a-half year ago, had plotted the murder with Bhoir.“The duo intercepted Jain as he was walking home from his jewellery store at 10.30 pm on August 14 and made him get into a cab being driven by Surve. They then strangled him inside the cab and disposed of the body in the Mumbra-Retibandar creek in the early hours of August 15. They then returned to the jewellery store and stole silver jewellery worth around Rs. 1.25 lakh,” deputy commissioner of police (Zone I) Avinash Ambure said.Mishra and Bhoir were picked up in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh and brought to Mumbai on Wednesday. Police have recovered a country made pistol, a country made revolver, and one live round from them. The silver jewellery stolen from Jain’s store was recovered from Cholekar’s possession last week, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mastermind-among-the-two-arrested-for-thane-jeweller-s-murder-101629972681995.html

Preliminary enquiry revealed that it could be Californium. They were trying to sell it for a few lakh rupees,” said an officer.CID officials said the samples would be sent to a government laboratory to verify whether they were Californium, a gram of which may cost up to a few crore rupees.“The accused persons have said they got the material from Kerala and brought here to sell. We are verifying all statements,” said the officer.Officers said the seized stones sparkled and seemed to be loaded with minerals. Californium is not found in nature and was first produced in a laboratory at University of California, Berkeley, in 1950 by US scientists. The metal is silvery white and is soft.It has a variety of uses, including in the start-up of nuclear reactors, and is used to detect gold and silver in ores.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/2-arrested-with-suspected-radioactive-material-californium-near-kolkata-airport-101629972442351.html

With this move, Sekhwan has changed three political parties in three years. “I was keeping unwell for the past several months, but no politician came to enquire after my health. It is Kejriwal ji who visited me in this hour. I am grateful to him,” Sekhwan said. Also read: Jaishankar says Afghan situation critical, evacuation priority at all-party meetInducting Sekhwan into the party, Kejriwal said, “He and his family have done a lot for Punjab and made great contribution in the politics of the state.

Reacting to the controversial remarks made by Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu’s adviser Malwinder Singh Mali over social media, he said, “From Kashmir to Kanyakumari, India is one and nobody can disintegrate it. Punjab is a border state, any statement should be made with wisdom here.” Punjab AAP president Bhagwant Mann, state unit in-charge and Delhi MLA Jarnail Singh and co-incharge Raghav Chaddha, leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema besides party leaders Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, MLA Baljinder Kaur and Manjeet Singh Bilaspur were present at Thursday’s event.Sekhwan was keeping a low profileSekhwan, a former senior vice-president of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD-Sanyukt), had been keeping a low profile since former minister Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and former MP Ranjit Singh Brahmpura joined their hands in June. Dhindsa and Brahmpura—the Akali leaders, who parted ways from the Shiromani Akali Dal over its chief Sukhbir Singh Badal’s style of working—had formed the SAD (Sanyukt) after dissolving their factions, the SAD (Democratic) and SAD (Taksali). The SAD (Taksali) was formed by Brahmpura, Sekhwan and former MP Ratan Singh Ajnala in December 2018 after the trio leaders had raised a banner of revolt against the SAD. Last year, Dhindsa floated the SAD (Democratic). From SAD (T), Sekhwan was the first to join hands with Dhindsa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/exakali-minister-sekhwan-joins-aap-in-kejriwal-s-presence-101629972382181.html

The mishap occurred at around 8.30 am as the boat carrying 17 people, which had set sail from Deendayal Ghat, sank in the river. Most of the passengers were daily commuters headed to an agricultural field in diara areas (fertile river islands that emerge after floods). 14 of the passengers on the boat were rescued by local fishermen and divers despite the river being in spate following the recent spell of rainfall and a constant discharge of water from Valmikinagar barrage.“We were heading towards the Diara area when the boat suddenly shook badly and the next moment we were in water,” Abhishek Anand, circle officer (CO), Bagaha recalled what one of the rescued persons had said. Shekhar Anand, sub divisional magistrate (SDM) Bagaha, said search for the missing three was on. Officials said the mishap was likely caused by overloading and high water current in the Gandak river.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-three-missing-in-boat-mishap-in-gandak-river-14-rescued-101629968781772.html
26-08-2021||Other||65% active Covid cases||Around 65 % of the 441 current active cases are seeking treatment in the hospital while 35% are in home isolation. Among the 65% seeking treatment over 28% are still in Intensive Care Unit or on Oxygen beds while 2.9% are on ventilators. Another 33% are under observation in Dedicated Covid Health centres where serious or patients with complicated cases are admitted. Hardly, 0.9% is admitted to Covid Care Centres which are quarantine centres, as among the 441 active patients currently, 35% are under home quarantine. The number of Covid cases is decreasing with each passing day and the city is currently recording 98.16% recovery rate. However, most of the positive cases recorded continue to seek oxygen or ICU beds. A senior officer from TMC, said, “With other monsoon related illnesses at its peak, sometimes people take the symptoms lightly causing delay in getting medical attention. In such instances the positive patients have to get admitted and need oxygen support.” “Currently, we have 7% occupancy in ICU and 2.1% occupancy for Oxygen beds. The active patients are reducing and the overall growth rate of Covid cases in the last one week is 0.03%. We have observed during the onset of the second wave that fatalities were more when positive patients sought medical help more than a week after they noticed symptoms. It is essential to understand one’s symptoms and reach out to a medical practitioner for proper care even during home quarantine. We have TMC’s dedicated call centre that keeps a tab on all patients, through this if we notice any symptoms we reach out to the patients’ family and ask them to get admitted at the earliest,” said Vipin Sharma, Commissioner, TMC. TMC has a total of 9163 beds; from these 4166 are Dedicated Covid Hospitals or Dedicated Covid Healthcentres. Around 2723 beds are with oxygen support; 975 ICU beds, 895 Covid Care Centres and 404 Ventilators. While the occupancy of ventilators and Covid Care Centres is the least at 13 patients and 4 patients respectively; Dedicated Covid hospitals or healthcare centres have 147 patients. Currently, the city has an overall occupancy of only 4% beds. In mid-April when the cases were at its peak 80% beds were occupied; a shortage of beds and oxygen was also witnessed during the second wave. As per the state government guidelines, any municipal corporation needs to ensure that there is around 15% availability of beds from among the total positive cases; however it has been noticed that Thane city had a 30% demand for beds during both the first and second wave. Dr Sanjay Pingulkar, General Physician, said, “Unlike earlier when it was difficult to make provisions for so many beds and oxygen facility, currently there are facilities available and it becomes natural for positive patients to get admitted. However, if compared to earlier, the numbers continue to remain lower of those who are in ICU or under oxygen support, this is due to the evolved medical practices surrounding Covid 19. Alongwith home quarantine for those who have mild symptoms if we continue to maintain social distance, sanitise and wear masks at all times, we can avoid a panic situation in case of a probable third wave.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/65-active-covid-cases-101629968661773.html
26-08-2021||Ranchi||Jharkhand: BJP MLA demands exclusive treatment ward for tribals at Deoghar AIIMS||Jharkhand BJP legislator Narayan Das has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya for setting up an exclusive ward for treatment of scheduled tribes at Deoghar’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). The out patients department (OPD) service at the newly-established institute was inaugurated by Mandaviya on Tuesday. In his letter to the PM and the health minister, Das has argued that Deoghar AIIMS was located in tribal-dominated Santhal Pargana division of Jharkhand and a special ward for the community would ensure better healthcare for them. “Including my assembly constituency of Deoghar, Santhal Pargana division is a tribal dominated area. There are six districts in the division and people from Bihar and West Bengal would also benefit after the establishment of AIIMS at Deoghar. Therefore, a Schedule Tribe (ST) special treatment ward should be established there so that tribals could benefit from it as they have remained undeveloped even 7-8 decades after independence,” reads Das’ letter to the PM and the health minister. When asked if he was demanding some sort of reservation for a particular community in health service, Das said it should not be seen with the prism of quota. “All political parties demand for welfare and development of vulnerable groups including the poor, Dalits and the tribals. My only intention is to seek better healthcare for the tribals in the region,” Das said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-bjp-mla-demands-exclusive-treatment-ward-for-tribals-at-deoghar-aiims-101629966561469.html
26-08-2021||Patna||Snag in billing and payment for power inconvenience 1.8m consumers in Bihar||Around 1.8 million power consumers in Bihar will have to pay the combined energy bills for July and August next month after a snag in one of the two billing servers on July 30 not only impeded generation of energy bills, but also disrupted online payments partially. A team of software engineers from New Delhi are camping in Patna for the last three weeks to fix the bug, which has hindered operations of the two discoms - the north and the south Bihar power distribution companies limited (NBPDCL & SBPDCL). The snag has affected around 700,000 power consumers under the NBPDCL and 1.1 million under the SBPDCL across 63 towns in 35 of the 38 districts of Bihar, excluding Muzaffarpur, Gaya and Bhagalpur.“We expect to rectify the snag this week and shall resume generation of energy bills from September 1,” said Sanjiwan Sinha, managing director of SBPDCL. “Online payments are now possible, allowing consumers to make advance payments, which they were unable to do earlier. The advance amount will be adjusted against their next energy bill, after the problem is resolved,” Sinha added. The engineers have been able to fix the problem only partially and online advance payments through mobile applications such as Suvidha and Bihar Bijli Bill Pay are still not possible. Not just that, payment through the portal of the two discoms is not fully functional and the data shows arrears even when June bills have been paid. “The SBPDCL portal showed an outstanding amount of 3,100 (approx.) for June despite the fact that I had paid the energy bill for the month of June on July 8, well before the payment due date of July 23,” said Sushant Kumar, a domestic subscriber residing at the New Patliputra Colony in Patna. Suresh Narayan Lall, a retired electrical engineer and domestic subscriber, residing at Patna’s Bahadurpur housing colony, said the SBPDCL portal showed an arrear of ₹1300 (approx.) from June, which he had already paid. Kumar and Lall were able to make advance payments through the SBPDCL portal on Wednesday. Dr Sandeep Sen of Sen Diagnostics, however, wasn’t lucky enough. “I have been trying repeatedly for the last one week but am unable to make an advance lump-sum payment for my energy bill of July. I get different messages on the portal. Initially, it said ‘error retrieving bill details, please try again’. Today, it said the consumer number is not registered with the SBPDCL,” said Dr Sen. The NBPDCL and the SBPDCL, however, claimed that advance payments were going on smoothly through their respective portals. “Total 194 (online) payments received today till now. Team is constantly monitoring the same,” read a text message from a senior officer in the NBPDCL. Payment collection data till 1pm on Wednesday, shared by another senior officer in the SBPDCL, claimed 2,053 online transactions led to realisation of ₹30.79 lakh in urban areas while 5,894 transactions led to remittance of ₹73.30 lakh in rural areas. Efforts to contact Chaturbhuj Mishra, SBPDCL chief data based administrator, the officer tasked to resolve the crisis, proved futile as he chose not to respond to repeated phone calls and text messages. SBPDCL managing director, however, allayed fears of delayed payment surcharge being levied on energy bills for the period of the snag. “The bill pay-by-date has been extended till August 31 for consumers whose payment due date was between July 30 and August 15. They will also be allowed rebate for timely payment, which will reflect in their next energy bill. All adjustments will be done in the next bill for consumers who have paid in excess,” said Sinha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/snag-in-billing-and-payment-for-power-inconvenience-1-8m-consumers-in-bihar-101629965121626.html
26-08-2021||Patna||Father and son accused of being police informers, killed by Maoists in Bihar||Left Wing Extremists (LWE) in Bihar’s Jamui district slit throats of a father-son duo before shooting them, accusing them of being police informers, late on Wednesday night. In the last two years, the ultras have killed at least 20 civilians in the state after declaring them to be spies working for security forces. The deceased have been identified as Chopay Hembram (60) and his son Arjun Hembram (32), residents of Baratand village. They were both assassinated on the foothills of Maoist-dominated Chakai-Bogi hill, at the border of Chakai and Charka Patthar police stations in the district, a police officer said.According to eyewitness accounts, an armed group of outlawed CPI (Maoist) outfit stormed into the village at around 12.30 am and abducted the duo from their houses. The outlaws dragged the men out even as their families pleaded their innocence. The Maoists fired three blank rounds to terrorise the villagers and raised ‘Lal Salaam’ slogans before vanishing into the hilly-forest area, where the captured duo was thrashed and their throat slit before being shot with bullets, police said.Jamui sub divisional police officer (SDPO) Dr Rakesh Kumar said the villagers later recovered their bodies lying at two separate places on Thursday morning. Police said it also appeared that the Maoists first slit the duo’s throat before shooting them. Police also found handwritten Maoist posters from the spot claiming that they killed the father and the son for acting as police informers. The note also warned other villagers of similar consequences if they opted to be police informers. Villagers and members of the deceased families alleged the police arrived very late despite being informed about the incident. The SDPO added that an FIR had been lodged in the case and a search operation had begun in Jamui and adjoining Giridih district of Jharkhand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/father-and-son-accused-of-being-police-informers-killed-by-maoists-in-bihar-101629960801091.html

26-08-2021||Delhi||SC approves Delhi Police decision, says no tainted candidates for force||The Supreme Court on Wednesday approved the decision of the Delhi Police to refuse appointment as constables to four persons acquitted in criminal cases as the judges held that persons recruited to police force should have the ability to inspire public confidence.Dealing with the appeal of the Delhi Police which lost before the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) and the Delhi high court, a bench of justices KM Joseph and S Ravindra Bhat said that in matters of public employment, courts should not second guess the suitability of a candidate as this function is best left to the executive power of the state.The top court set aside the decision of the Delhi high court of December 5, 2013 noting serious lapses on how it sought to condone the offences of kidnapping, house trespass, causing grievous hurt and rioting against the four candidates based on their young age and rural setting where such crimes are frequent.The top court said, “The impugned order indicates a broad view that such misdemeanour should not be taken seriously, given the age of the youth and the rural setting. Such generalisations, leading to condonation of the offender’s conduct, should not enter the judicial verdict and should be avoided.”Also Read | Over 100,000 kids were orphaned or lost a parent since April 2020: NCPCR to SC“Each case is to be scrutinised by the concerned public employer, through its designated officials- more so, in the case of recruitment for the police force who are under a duty to maintain order, and tackle lawlessness, since their ability to inspire public confidence is a bulwark to society’s security,” the bench stated in its judgment.The four candidates – Raj Kumar, Shiv Singh, Deepa Tomar and Prem Singh Chaudhary – had applied for constable posts in the Delhi Police following an advertisement issued in the year 2009. In their applications, they disclosed the criminal instituted against them.Raj Kumar was accused of house trespass (Section 451), rioting (Section 147), causing hurt (Section 323) and endangering life (Section 336) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) while Shiv Singh and Prem Singh Chaudhary faced offences of causing grievous hurt (Section 325), wrongful restraint (Section 341) under IPC. Deepa Tomar was charged with abduction (Section 364) of IPC of her own husband which she claimed to be a counterblast to her dowry harassment case filed against in-laws.In all cases, except that of Tomar, the trial court acquitted the accused either for want of evidence or on account of the accused having compromised with the complainant. Tomar was acquitted following trial.The screening committee of the Delhi Police found them unsuitable for appointment. The candidates got relief from CAT in separate orders which was brought up in appeal at the Delhi high court by Delhi Police. The top court said, “Courts exercising judicial review cannot second guess the suitability of a candidate for any public office or post. Absent evidence of malice or mindlessness (to the materials), or illegality by the public employer, an intense scrutiny on why a candidate is excluded as unsuitable renders the courts’ decision suspect to the charge of trespass into executive power of determining suitability of an individual for appointment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sc-approves-delhi-police-decision-says-no-tainted-candidates-for-force-101629960020987.html

After some years, the money lenders used to take their ATMs, passbooks, Aadhar Cards, cheque books and legal papers of property. The money lenders even used to withdraw salaries from their bank accounts and also take bank loans using seized documents of debt-ridden borrowers,” said a police officer, who didn’t wish to be named.A police officer involved in investigations against these money lenders said they were hearing complaints about a network of illegal money lenders harassing employees of SECL for a long time but the victims shied away from registering complaints since the lenders possessed all their important documents.Patel said the area police were not told about identities of people to be raided since the money lenders were reported to have local support. “They [local police] were only told when we reached their homes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/first-raid-on-illegal-money-lenders-in-mp-following-amended-law-8-arrested-101629951859876.html
26-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s dry spell to continue today; rainfall to pick up later this week||Delhi is likely to continue with its dry spell on Thursday as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasts no rain for the day with partly cloudy skies. IMD has forecast that rainfall would pick up in the capital later this week till August 28 at least.“Even after August 28, only scattered or patchy rainfall is likely, as no intense pressure system is seen building up to trigger good rains in Delhi and the surrounding region. There may be light rain on August 31,” said a senior IMD official. The minimum temperature on Monday is likely to be 27 degrees Celsius (°C) while the maximum temperature is predicted to reach 36°C. The maximum temperature was 36.4°C on Wednesday – three degrees above normal and the minimum temperature at 27.4°C was one degree above normal.Also Read | Woman, minor daughter raped by landlord in Nangloi; suspect on run, say copsWeather officials also stressed that this was another example of erratic weather patterns Delhi has been recording over the last few years. IMD scientists and private weather forecasters said that over the last decade, instead of receiving uniform rains, Delhi has been receiving short and intense rainfall. The number of rainy days has also reduced from around 15-17 between the years 2000 and 2009, to around 10-12 over the last 10 years.This year, Delhi saw only five rainy days in August. But in these five days, the city received 214.5mm rainfall, a 3% surplus, the bulk of which was concentrated on August 21.Meanwhile, Delhi’s air quality was in the moderate category on Thursday morning. Data from Central Pollution Control Board showed that the hourly air quality index (AQI) at 6am stood at 109. On Wednesday, the average 24-hour AQI was 115, which is also in the moderate category. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered good, 51 and 100 satisfactory, 101 and 200 moderate, 201 and 300 poor, 301 and 400 very poor, and 401 and 500 severe.On Wednesday, the Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar) said, “Delhi’s AQI is in the satisfactory category due to increased traffic emission from waterlogging in some areas and polluted air form north-west and will remain in the satisfactory category for the next two days. Moreover, higher ventilation does not allow dust to accumulate.”A recent analysis by Climate Trends, a Delhi-based communications initiative building a narrative around climate ambition and low carbon development pathways, highlighted how high pollution levels impacts monsoon patterns in a region. The analysis said with the levels of toxic pollution increasing, in the coming years, monsoon rain may reduce by at least 10%.“Air pollution is likely to decrease the southwest monsoon rainfall by 10%-15% for the entire country. Meanwhile, some places might even see rain drop up to 50%. It will also impact the dynamics of monsoon like cause a delay in onset,” said Dilip Ganguly, associate professor, Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT-Delhi, who is one of the contributors to the analysis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-dry-spell-to-continue-today-rainfall-to-pick-up-later-this-week-101629947720749.html

In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the DCI had requested to extend the internship completion cut-off date from March 31 to July 31 for those students who appeared in the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET)-MDS 2021 and fulfil the eligibility criteria for admission to MDS and PG diploma courses. The DGHS in a notice said the competent authority has decided to extend the last date of internship as a one-time measure, not to be taken as a precedent. “Also, the registration and choice filling is being extended by one day to allow such candidates to register and exercise choices who have become eligible after the extension of internship completion date,” it reads. Earlier, candidates undergoing a one-year rotatory internship or practical training were required to complete their internship by March 31. Now, the candidates who completed internship on or before July 31 will be eligible for admissions to MDS. The medical counselling committee has started the first round of counselling for admissions to 1,326 MDS seats under the all India quota. As many as 26,000 candidates, including 2,150 from Punjab, had taken the NEET MDS in December. The result of the test was declared on December 31 but the counselling was postponed following second wave of covid-19 in the country. Punjab has 11 dental colleges, including two government-run at Amritsar and Patiala, which offer 139 seats in MDS courses. There are 11 all india quota MDS seats in two government dental colleges in the state. However, the Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS) is yet to start counselling for the 85% state-quota MDS seats in government dental colleges and all the seats of private dental colleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mds-admissions-internship-completion-cut-off-date-extended-101629922820255.html

The farmers blocked both sides of the road leading to the meeting venue at Circuit House and scuffled with police personnel who had put up multiple barricades to stop the protesters. Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU Rajewal) activists said they will oppose the BJP programmes across the state as the party had introduced black laws to ruin the state’s farmers. “People will not tolerate excessive force used by the police,” they added. Ashwani Sharma said the BJP and its workers were fully prepared for the elections and the people of the state were ready to bring the party as an alternative. “We will hold booth-level conferences in all 117 seats in the coming days. We thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the safe return of 400 Punjab-origin people from Afghanistan to India,” he added. He called upon the leaders of the farmer organisations to resolve the issue related to the three agriculture laws as they did in case of sugarcane prices with the Punjab government. “They should give up their demand for of repeal of the three laws and sit with the central government in the interests of the farmers,” the BJP leader said. “The farm reform laws have not been implemented so far.

26-08-2021||Chandigarh||HC notice to govt, industries minister as 2 Hoshiarpur residents allege threat to life||The Punjab and Haryana high court has sought response from the Punjab government and state industries minister Sham Sundar Arora on a petition from two Hoshiarpur residents claiming threat to their life from an “aide” of Arora. The bench of GS Sandhawalia also sought a status report from the Hoshiarpur senior superintendent of police (SSP) within two weeks, failing which costs of ₹10,000 each will be payable to the petitioners. The SSP has also been directed to look into the representations made by the petitioners and take appropriate steps to ensure that their lives and liberty is not put under threat by the accused or their associate. The minister, the police and the state government have to respond to the allegations by September 13. The court acted on the plea of Vivek Kaushal and Kamal Bhargav who had claimed threat to their lives from one Vishwanath Ohri of Hoshiarpur who is purportedly an associate of minister Arora. They had also alleged that even as one of them was brutally assaulted, but on July 31 a case was registered at the Model Town police station, Hoshairpur under bailable sections. They had demanded that the case be handed over to an independent agency. The court was told that an FIR was lodged in January 2019 against Vishwanath Ohri and a special investigating team (SIT) had found that he was involved in the incident, wherein even the deputy director, Punjab Police Academy (PAP), and the other government officials were assaulted and their vehicles damaged. It was found that Ohri even fired a gunshot on the left thigh of his accomplice so that a cross-FIR could be lodged, the court was told, adding that even after this, due to collusion of state machinery with Ohri who is allegedly an aide of the minister, the petitioners had to move the court for an independent probe in that matter too and a status report has been called from the state as investigation was not being completed. The court was further told that Bhargav, along with his companions, were brutally assaulted in July and the incident was captured in CCTV cameras.

Former diplomat KC Singh, founder and convener of the forum, said, “Our aim is to solicit the feedback of Punjab residents, both in urban and rural areas, on various issue and initiate an interactive dialogue.” Forum secretary Col (retd) LJS Gill said there are 14 co-founders belonging to different fields. “Many of the co-founders, who worked with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ahead of the 2017 polls, are unhappy with the party’s functioning, particularly its handling of state issues,” he said. Sharing the forum’s vision, Singh said “This platform will work towards finding solutions to the pressing issues facing the people of Punjab. We will offer solutions, but more importantly go to the people and seek their advice.” The forum, he added, had no political ambitions. Maj Gen (retd) Satbir Singh said, “We recognise the services and sacrifices of armed forces. Ex-servicemen must be granted the dignity they deserve and they must be roped in for the betterment of the state.” Activist Prof Ronki Ram said, “We need to promote skill-based education in government schools for generation of dignified employment at the grassroots level.” Also present on the occasion were forum co-founders former Punjab DGP DR Bhatti, Air Marshal (retd) PS Gill, Arjuna Awardee Gurbir Singh Sandhu and Justice (retd) Kamaljit Singh Garewal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nonpolitical-forum-sanjha-sunehra-punjab-manch-launched-101629922817070.html

The outgoing president and SAD’s warhorse Manjinder Singh Sirsa, however, lost to former president Harvinder Singh Sarna by 469 votes in a fierce contest on the Punjabi Bagh seat. But Sirsa is set to become the gurdwara body’s president again as SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal said he will be nominated from the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) quota. The SAD top brass sees the result as a practice match for the upcoming assembly polls in Punjab. Addressing the media in Delhi, Sukhbir said: “It is the beginning of a “storm which will sweep the Congress and the AAP aside” in the Punjab assembly polls next year.” Former DSGMC chief Manjit Singh GK-led Jago party won in three wards, while Akali Dali (Delhi) headed by Paramjit Singh Sarna got 14 seats, the directorate of gurdwara elections said. Sarna said: “We hoped to do much better, but we accept that the voters have the final say.” Independent candidate Tarvinder Singh Marwah won the Jangpura ward. The SAD got 40.27% of the total votes polled, while SAD (Delhi) and Jago party polled 27.79% and 15.72% votes, respectively, according to data issued by the directorate. The DSGMC which controls historic shrines in the city, including Rakabganj and Bangla Sahib gurdwaras, as well as various academic institutions and hospitals, goes to polls every four years. It has an annual budget of ₹110 crore.Under the 1971 DSGMC Act, a 51-member House runs the gurdwara body. Over and above 46 elected members, there is a provision to nominate one member from the SGPC quota, while two members come via co-option and two more come from the Singh Sabhas (local gurdwaras) in Delhi. A total of 312 candidates including 132 independents fought the elections conducted on Sunday. The voting had witnessed a low turnout of 37.27%, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-scores-third-win-on-trot-in-delhi-gurdwara-body-polls-sarna-defeats-sirsa-101629922756121.html

26-08-2021||Chandigarh||High command draws a line: Rawat says Capt will lead Cong in Punjab assembly polls||A day after four cabinet ministers and two dozen party MLAs close to Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu sought the chief minister’s removal, the Congress central leadership on Wednesday backed chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, stating that he would lead the party in the state polls early next year. “We will contest the 2022 assembly elections under Capt Amarinder’s leadership,” All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary and Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat told reporters, putting to rest all speculations about leadership change, even before his meeting with a seven-member delegation of ministers and MLAs authorised by the disgruntled party leaders to convey their demand for the chief minister’s removal to the central leadership. Rawat also said there was no threat to the state government and party in the state. The seven ministers and MLAs raised the demand for replacement of Amarinder, but were conveyed that he would not be changed, said sources close to the state incharge. The state incharge’s clear-cut statement ruling out a leadership change has come as a blow to them. Cabinet ministers Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Charanjit Singh Channi and Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, who are at the forefront of the clamour in a section of the party for Capt’s removal, had travelled to Dehradun along with three MLAs Kulbir Singh Zira, Surjit Singh Dhiman and Barindermeet Singh Pahra to apprise him of the sentiments prevailing in the state unit. The ministers and MLAs, all known detractors of Amarinder – conveyed their grievances and concerns relating to unfulfilled poll promises and the present political scenario in the state to Rawat during a two-and-a-half hours long meeting at a hotel there. Capt’s detractors had met at rural development minister Tript Bajwa’s official residence on Tuesday and decided to seek the chief minister’s removal, expressing their “lack of faith” in him over the issue of unfulfilled poll promises. Besides escalating the factional fight in the state Congress with just five months to go for the state polls, their rebellion ended an uneasy truce between Sidhu and Amarinder brokered by the Congress central leadership after months of tense negotiations that concluded with the former’s appointment as the state chief with the chief minister grudgingly accept it. After the meeting, Channi and Bajwa said they told Rawat about their grievances and sentiments prevailing in the Punjab Congress regarding the unfulfilled poll promises. “We are firm on our demands. He (Rawat) heard us patiently on all issues. He appeared convinced and told us that he would talk to high command. We have sought time from the central leadership. If they call us, we will to go to Delhi to present our views,” the two ministers said, expressing satsification with the state in-charge’s response. Though the initial plan was to head to Delhi from Dehradun, they returned to Chandigarh after meeting Rawat. The disgruntled group has been questioned the CM’s ability and intent in honouring poll promises such as delay in justice in sacrilege and police firing cases, arrest of “big fish” involved in drug rackets and cancelation of power purchase agreements. Another grouse raised by them is the attempt by the Capt camp to target his detractors by sidelining their supporters to weaken them in their constituencies. A case in point being cited by them is the replacement of market committee chairperson in Bajwa’s area.Addressing the media after the meeting, Rawat said the four ministers and three MLAs conveyed their concerns regarding the the way things were being handled and wanted a clear roadmap for the party’s victory in the upcoming state polls. “They expressed serious concerns over the functioning of the state government and district administration. If a party MLA is feeling insecure that the district administration is working for his defeat because someone is upset with him, it is a matter of serious concern. I have had similar complaints earlier,” he said, refusing to share details of their discussions. The state incharge also said he would go to Delhi in a day or two to brief the party high command. On the controversy generated by the statements of the Punjab Congress president’s advisers on Kashmir and Pakistan, Rawat said he spoke to Sidhu and told him to rein them in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/high-command-draws-a-line-rawat-says-capt-will-lead-cong-in-punjab-assembly-polls-101629922334954.html

The accused has been identified as Mohammad Iqbal Bhat, son of Ghulam Rasool Bhat of Kishtwar, presently putting up at Tawi Vihar in Sidhra, Jammu. He has been booked under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code for his involvement in misappropriating ₹32 lakh from the complainants by offering them sale of a piece of land measuring three kanals, near the railway station in Bajalta, at a cost of ₹10 lakh per kanal in 2013. The chargesheet was produced before the court of chief judicial magistrate, Jammu, for judicial determination. The case owes its origin to a written complaint lodged by Rubina Bhat, wife of Abdul Manan Bhat, Arsh Bhat, wife of Umar Khan of Sidhra Nagrota, and Arooj Aleem Beig, wife of Aleem Beigh of Ambphala in Jammu. The complainants had alleged that they were in search of a piece of land in Sidhra or Bajalta area and in the process, they met the accused who offered them land near the railway station Pargalta, Bajalta, and paid him ₹32 lakh. However, after receiving the entire payment, the accused started avoiding the complainants on one pretext or the other and didn’t give them the possession of the land nor did he return the money. It was further alleged that accused Mohammad Iqbal gave them cheques of different amounts from time to time in 2015 but all the cheques were dishonoured by the respective banks due to insufficient funds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/crime-branch-produces-chargesheet-in-rs-32-lakh-fraud-case-in-jammu-101629920774676.html
26-08-2021||Chandigarh||Current duty charge experience to be considered for promotion: HC||The experience gained by an employee while working on current duty charge is to be treated as a part of experience for promotion, the Punjab and Haryana high court has held. The high court bench of justice Rajan Gupta observed that the executive instructions of December 2016 providing that the period of current duty charge will not be counted for the purposes of experience, seniority or any other benefit, is totally against the law. Current duty charge is given against a vacant post on the basis of seniority. The high court dismissed an appeal by Punjab government against a single judge bench. The matter was brought to court by Anil Sharma, working as conservator of soils with the Punjab government, who had sought quashing of an order of May 2020 in which extension of tenure was afforded on the post of chief conservator of soils, Punjab, to Dharminder Sharma, an Indian Forest Service officer and the then chief conservator of forests. He had also challenged 2016 instructions that period of current duty charge (CDC) will not be counted for the purpose of experience or seniority or any other benefit, seeking promotion to the post, claiming that he was qualified and fulfils the experience laid down for the said post. The government had contested the claims arguing that Dharminder Sharma’s deputation was in view of the fact that no employee from the department was eligible for consideration to the post of chief conservator of soils but single judge bench had ruled in favour of Anil Sharma, holding that he has gained experience while working as conservator of soils on current duty charge and the same is to be counted towards experience while considering his case for promotion to the post of chief conservator of soils. Subsequently, one Rajesh Vashisth replaced Dharminder Sharma. The court also found that the notification on promotions did not make any difference between the person working on a regular basis on substantive post and the person having additional charge of the said post. “So, the learned single judge rightly observed that respondent No.1 (Anil Sharma) has gained requisite experience while working on current duty charge and he clearly fulfils the requirement of the rules and therefore qualifies to be considered for promotion to the post of chief conservator of soils,” the bench said. Now the government has been asked to decide on the claim of Sharma within a period of two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/current-duty-charge-experience-to-be-considered-for-promotion-hc-101629920714702.html

26-08-2021||Chandigarh||HC asks lower court to defer trial against man booked for wife’s rape||Chandigarh The high court has asked a court in Hoshiarpur to defer trial against a man who was booked for raping his wife, on latter’s complaint. The high court bench of justice Amol Rattan Singh acted on the plea of a Palampur (Himachal Pradesh) resident, who had got married to a woman in Hoshairpur in 2019. She got registered a case of rape and criminal conspiracy against him, his mother and sister, both widows, his lawyer Arnav Sood said. The court was told that challan was submitted by the local police on April 5, 2021, and is now pending for framing of charges against them. “No offence is made out as woman is legally wedded wife of the petitioner and both made physical relation after the marriage. The mother and sister resided in Palampur, they had nothing to do with the alleged allegations,” Sood had told the court, seeking quashing of the FIR and adding that no probe was conducted by the police. “.. even if the aforesaid allegations are taken to be true then also no offence under section 376 IPC (rape) is made out against the petitioners. The respondent number 2 (wife) could have initiated prosecution under the Domestic Violence Act. By no stretch of imagination Section 376 (IPC) is attracted in the present case,” Sood had argued. It was further submitted that as per exception 2 to Section 375 of the IPC, which defines rape — sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under fifteen years of age, is not rape. When the first offence cannot statutorily stand, the question of any offence punishable under Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC also cannot stand, the plea adds. “In the meanwhile, till the next date of hearing only and specifically, the trial court is directed to adjourn the matter to a date beyond what is given by this court, till the next date of hearing,” ordered the bench of justice Singh while fixing the hearing for September 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-asks-lower-court-to-defer-trial-against-man-booked-for-wife-s-rape-101629920534936.html

26-08-2021||Mumbai||All you need to know about ZyCoV-D vaccine||Ahmedabad based pharmaceutical company Zydus Cadila received the Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) for its Covid-19 vaccine called ZyCoV-D last week. It is the first vaccine approved for children above 12 years. The vaccine has been approved for a three-dose regimen, but the company is likely to submit more data to the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) for a two-dose regimen. What’s needle-free technology? What is a DNA-based vaccine? And when will we know about the vaccine’s phase 3 trial data? (A company press release from last month, interim results of Phase 3 revealed a 66.6% primary efficacy.) Plasmid DNA technology used With ZyCoV-D, there are now six vaccines permitted for use in India although only three are currently in use. ZyCoV-D, developed in partnership with the Department of Biotechnology has been made on the Plasmid DNA platform. Plasmids are ring-like pieces of DNA that self-replicate. They are modified to encode the antigen or spike protein of the Sars-CoV-2, which are delivered inside the cell of the human body, prompting the production of more such proteins. This in turn triggers an immune response from the body forming antibodies against Covid-19. How it’s different from the other vaccinesOxford-AstraZeneca’s Covishield and Gamaleya Scientific Research Institute’s Sputnik V use a viral vector platform or an adenovirus (like the common cold virus) modified to encapsulate the genetic code of the Sars-CoV-2 spike protein, while Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin is an inactivated Sars-Cov 2 virus, which once injected, triggers an immune response. Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose vaccine (which will be made by Hyderabad-based Biological E) is also a viral vector vaccine while Moderna – which Cipla was permitted in June to import – uses the messenger Ribonucleic Acid or mRNA platform, in which the genetic code of a single spike protein of the Sars Cov-2 virus is injected into the body, prompting the cells to make more of it thus triggering an immune response. Intra-dermal, needle-free vaccine The three vaccines currently available are all for the adult population and are intramuscular, meaning the vaccine is injected into the muscles. ZyCoV-D is an intradermal Covid-19 vaccine that is delivered into the dermis or the layer right under the upper layer of the skin (the epidermis). While other intradermal vaccines like the BCG vaccine use needles, ZyCoV-D is a needle-free vaccine administered with the help of a needle-free applicator. The applicator pushes a small quantity of the vaccine into the skin at very high pressure. “The applicator is calibrated for a 0.1 ml dose, and it is delivered within a fraction of a second,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of Mumbai’s BYL Nair Hospital where a ZyCoV-D trial is ongoing. The hospital has a target to enroll 50 adolescents but has so far managed to get only 11 candidates. “None of them have complained of pain. The applicator makes a sound at the time of administering the vaccine. All the children said they were distracted with that sound, and didn’t realise that they received any injection,” said Bharmal. Some studies state that needle-free jet injections can improve the delivery of DNA vaccine compared to a standard needle injector. The needle-free technology also reduces needle injuries as well as waste.Trial data yet to be made public The interim results of ZyCoV-D from the Phase 3 clinical trials with over 28,000 volunteers have shown primary efficacy of 66.6%, a company press release stated last month. Around 1000 of these volunteers were in the age group of 12 to 17 years. These findings have been submitted to the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI), based on which EUA was granted to the vaccine. However, the data is yet to be published or made available publicly. The Hindustan Times reached out to Zydus Cadila to know the likely schedule of phase 3 data publication but did not receive a response. “It is ideal to have the data published before any kind of approvals are granted by the drug regulator,” said immunisation expert Dr Naveen Thacker. “But we are in a war-like situation in this pandemic and it is understood that the subject expert committee has done a fair scrutiny of the data before granting the approval.” Can it be used on children?Zy-CoV-D is the first vaccine to be approved for use in children above the age of 12 in India. According to a press release by Zydus Cadila dated July 1, the vaccine was tested on 1000 children between 12 and 18 years and was found to be “safe and very well tolerated”. “Since it’s a new technology, the vaccine should be first administered to a large number of the adult population to know the side effects that may have been missed during the trial phase,” said paediatrician and infectious disease expert Dr Tanu Singhal, who practices at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/all-you-need-to-know-about-zycov-d-vaccine-101629920301835.html
26-08-2021||Chandigarh||Four drug overdose deaths in two weeks baffle Bathinda authorities||Four deaths allegedly due to drug overdose in the last two weeks have sent the Bathinda district authorities in a tizzy. The deceased were in their 20s and the bodies were found by the activists of a social organisation from public places in the city. Police sources said syringes and needles found on or near the bodies pointed to drug abuse. They said it was for the first time in the last several years that so many drug-related deaths were reported from Bathinda city in such a short span. Bathinda senior superintendent of police (SSP) Ajay Maluja said the recent cases have come to his notice and police are looking into the matter. Health officials said the number could be much higher as most deaths due to substance abuse go unreported. Official data says, on an average, 22 patients get registered daily at the dedicated outpatient opioid-assisted treatment (OOAT) centres launched by the Punjab government in Bathinda in October 2018. Dr Arun Bansal, a psychiatrist and in-charge of OOAT programme in Bathinda, said 21,783 drug addicts have been enrolled at eight government centres from October 2018 till July this year. This year till July, the district has recorded 826 new cases whereas, in July 104 people enrolled for de-addiction, he added. “In more than 50% cases, the patients are hooked to heroin or ‘chitta’. Nearly 65% of the patients at OOAT are in the 17-25 age group. In most cases, the addicts come from the lower-income group and admit to engaging in thefts to fulfil their need for synthetic drugs. Such people need counselling and social support to join the mainstream,” said Bansal. Sources at Shaheed Bhai Mani Singh Civil Hospital said an average of 3-4 cases of drug overdose are reported daily. A 23-year-old, Amrit Kaur, widow of Manpreet Singh, was inconsolable on Wednesday at her house in Basti number-5 at Bir Talab, located in Bathinda’s vicinity. Body of Manpreet, a flower decoration worker, was found near Ring Road on August 15. He left behind his parents, a widow, and a month-old daughter. Amrit said she was unaware of Manpreet’s dependence on drugs. “Manpreet’s untimely death has shattered us. He was a hardworking person and we have no idea when he started taking drugs,” Manpreet’s elder brother Gurpreet Singh said. Another family whose member is struggling to get out of substance abuse said drugs were available easily in the city and peddlers even offer home delivery. “It is impossible that the police are unaware of the drug trade and availability in Bathinda. I have not seen the civil society activists acting as a pressure group on the elected representatives and administrations to curb the nuisance. Drug abuse is severely affecting the Punjabi youth but it becomes an issue only during the elections,” said the parent, requesting anonymity. Senior superintendent of police Maluja said he would soon chalk out a strategy to handle the growing problem of narcotics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/four-drug-overdose-deaths-in-two-weeks-baffle-bathinda-authorities-101629920297153.html

In a press statement issued here, Prof Bansal said two 12-member teams have been formed by the CUHP to coordinate with departments concerned to speed up the process. He said the land at Dehra has already been transferred in the name of CUHP. “We have asked the revenue department to demarcate the land at earliest so that construction work could begin,” he said. The V-C said the CUHP has got a 115-hectare land at Dehra, of which 81 hectares are classified as forest land while 34 are non-forested land. As far as the land identified at Jadrangal near Dharamshala is concerned, Prof Bansal said, the university authorities have held a meeting with the local administration and discussed the ongoing process regarding geological survey. “The local administration has sought the Director General of the Geological Survey of India, Kolkata, to conduct geological survey of the proposed forest land at Jadrangal,” he said. He said a high-powered committee of the Union environment ministry had inspected the land in February 2021 and recommended that the administration conduct the geological survey on 280 hectares of forest land identified for CUHP campus at Jadrangal. “We are awaiting the report of the Geological Survey and if it is favourable, the construction work will start soon,” he said.

26-08-2021||Chandigarh||Navjot Sidhu responsible for Punjab Cong turmoil: Preneet||Congress MP Preneet Kaur on Wednesday hit out at ministers and MLAs who are seeking the removal of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and held Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu responsible for the present situation in the state unit. Kaur, who is Amarinder’s wife, said the disgruntled leaders should refrain from raking up issues that were damaging the party ahead of the 2022 assembly elections. “They should give positive inputs to get the party back to power,” she told reporters. She also lavished praise on the chief minister for doing his best, leading the party to “many victories” and doing good work to take Punjab on the road to progress despite Covid and financial constraints. Asked about the party leaders who are speaking out against the Congress government, the Patiala MP said they should be first asked if they were happy during the past four-and-a-half years. “This is not the time to say such things…it is damaging the party. It is for the party high command to see what is happening on the ground and do what is best for the party,” she said. When asked if she holds the PPCC chief responsible for the current situation, the Congress leader replied, “Of course he is. He is the one who started. They are his advisers”. She said the CM showed “maturity and large-heartedness” after the party high command decided to make Sidhu the state unit president. On the demand for the CM’s replacement, Kaur said this was not up to them. “It is up to the high command,” she added. In response to a question on Sidhu’s advisers, Kaur said, “I do not know where these advisers came from”. The PPCC president should choose his people from within the party, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/navjot-sidhu-responsible-for-punjab-cong-turmoil-preneet-101629920056500.html
26-08-2021||Chandigarh||Panjab University likely to allow students to pay semester fee in instalments||Panjab University (PU) is likely to allow students to pay semester fees in instalments again this year considering the problems faced by them during the pandemic.Although the varsity is yet to make an announcement, a meeting of a committee was held on Tuesday in which the suggestion was made. A senior university official confirmed the development and said, “The students may be allowed to pay semester fees in three or four instalments.”The panel’s recommendation, however, is subject to approval of the vice-chancellor, Raj Kumar. The development comes after students submitted a representation to PU. Earlier this month, the National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) wrote to the dean student welfare (DSW) after students were asked to pay fees by August 24, asking the varsity to implement the previous year’s system of allowing instalments. NSUI has also asked students not to pay the fees unless their demands are accepted.“We had given a call to students not to pay the fee and many students, especially from the self-financed courses, did not pay. It is obvious that students cannot pay a high fee in only one instalment. University should issue a notification extending the last date for fee submission and allowing students to pay in instalments,” said Nikhil Narmeta, NSUI president at PU.Students were allowed to pay their fee in four instalments last year after a series of protests. PU has already decided to suspend the annual hike in semester fee for varsity students and those studying in affiliated colleges for the second year in a row. It is also likely that the varsity may provide financial assistance to students adversely affected by the pandemic. However, such cases may be scrutinised before assistance is provided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panjab-university-likely-to-allow-students-to-pay-semester-fee-in-instalments-101629919936498.html

The students have requested the ICCR to facilitate the issuance of visas so they could return to India.An Afghan student, Noor Hussain, also wrote a letter addressed to ICCR, which was submitted to PU’s dean international students on Wednesday. From security concerns to economic problems to poor internet connectivity, Afghan students listed out a number of issues being faced by them after the Taliban takeover.“Considering requirements of the varsity and the current unstable situation in Afghanistan, we need our visas immediately. Owing to the Taliban takeover, the embassy is closed. Therefore, it is kindly requested that the Indian embassy in Afghanistan (shifted to New Delhi now) issue us the visas (online) to us at the earliest,” reads the letter. The letter also asks for clarifications on the kind of visas they may be issued as students.A second-year student of MA (history), Narges Sadaqat, said, “Now as Covid cases have decreased, we want to be invited back to India. We are all jobless here and don’t have money to activate internet connection. All banks are shut and the panic situation does not permit us to concentrate on studies. Female students are even more in danger,” she said.“We have lost all hope, we want to come to Chandigarh and study in peace,” said Noor Hussain, a student at DAV College, Sector 10, who is presently in Kabul.Abdul Monir Kakar, president of Afghan Student Association in Chandigarh, said, “The Indian government should make efforts so that the students can return.

Between August 9 and August 13, nearly 1.18 crore passengers commuted by BEST buses in the city. Between August 15 and August 23, nearly 1 crore passengers travelled by the BEST buses. On an average, nearly 2.4 million passengers travel by the BEST buses daily. With the decrease in the number of passengers, the BEST has decided to introduce additional buses on feeder routes from September 1. “We will operate buses on more feeder routes in the city. The buses will be operated mostly from suburban railway stations to carry passengers. There has been a decrease in the number of BEST commuters which is why buses will be introduced on feeder routes as opposed to longer routes in the city,” said a senior BEST official. The local trains were suspended for the general public on April 15 after the increase in Covid-19 cases in the city, but the BEST buses were operational. However, restrictions on movement of general public were imposed and the buses were used majorly for transportation of employees working in essential services.

26-08-2021||Chandigarh||Kejriwal in Punjab today, ex-Akali minister Sekhwan likely to join AAP||Former Akali minister Sewa Singh Sekhwan is likely to join the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in presence of the party’s national convener Arvind Kejriwal in Gurdaspur on Thursday. “Hon’ble chief minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal will be in Punjab tomorrow and shall visit former cabinet minister jathedar Sewa Singh Sekhwan at his native Sekhwan village in Gurdaspur district (sic.),” Delhi MLA and AAP’s Punjab co-incharge Raghav Chadha said in a tweet on Wednesday. 71-year-old Sekhwan, senior vice-president of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD-Sanyukt), has been keeping a low profile since Rajya Sabha member Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and former MP Ranjit Singh Brahmpura joined hands in June. Dhindsa and Brahmpura —Akali stalwarts who parted ways with Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal)— had formed SAD-Sanyukt party after dissolving SAD (Taksali) in April. SAD (Taksali) was formed by Brahmpura, Sekhwan, and former MP Rattan Singh Ajnala in December 2018 after raising a banner of revolt against SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal. Later, last year, Dhindsa formed SAD (Democratic). Sekhwan was the first to join Dhindsa from the SAD (Taksali) group. Sekhwan was unreachable while his son Jagroop Singh Sekhwan said, “My father has been keeping ill and Kejriwal is coming to enquire about his health.” Sekhwan’s political adviser Lakhwinder Singh Bhullar said, “Sekhwan has family relations with Kejriwal and the latter is coming to meet him.” A close associate of Sekhwan said it was “quite understandable” that he would join the party and that is “why a party head is coming to meet him”. Meanwhile, Dhindsa said, “Sekhwan had come to us on his own and now he is going on his own. I just want to say that it is not right for a leader to change parties frequently.” Brahmpura said, “We have information that he is joining AAP. Firstly, he left SAD (Taksali) and joined Dhindsa. Now, he is leaving Dhindsa and joining AAP. Such people have nothing to do with the people’s welfare and Sikh Panth. He is changing the party just for his political benefit. He can quit even AAP if he has something better on his way.” The AAP is trying to strengthen itself by embracing panthic faces ahead of 2022 assembly polls. Earlier in June, Kejriwal had inducted former inspector general (IG) of Punjab Police Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh into the party. Kunwar Vijay opted for premature retirement from his service, soon after the Punjab and Haryana High Court, in April, quashed the probe report filed by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) led by him into the Kotkapura firing case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kejriwal-in-punjab-today-ex-akali-minister-sekhwan-likely-to-join-aap-101629919875101.html

The industrialists, who are a part of the monitoring committee formed under the rejuvenation project, also participated. The officials stated that while 200 cusecs of freshwater had to be released into the nullah in a phased manner, as of now 100 cusecs was being released daily. The officials stated that the BOD and COD levels will further improve after more water was released.Ashu said, “There are some apprehensions in the minds of residents and activists, but we want to ensure that everything is being done with transparency. Releasing freshwater into the nullah is one component of the ₹650-crore project to rejuvenate the nullah and efforts are also being made to deal with sewer and dairy waste.”Ashu stated that they had also invited some environmental activists including Col (retd) JS Gill, who is also a member of the STF for cleaning the nullah, and CM Lakhanpal, for discussions regarding apprehensions, but they were not available due to personal reasons.He said that work had also commenced on two new sewage treatment plants (STPs) for treating domestic waters of total 285 MLD (Jamalpur 225 MLD and Balloke 60 MLD) capacity; rehabilitation of existing STPs with a treatment capacity of 418 MLD; two common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) for treatment of 6 MLD wastewater from two dairy complexes in Tajpur and Haibowal; six intermediate pumping stations; laying of 10-km pipeline and 10 years of operation and maintenance of entire infrastructure, which will be completed by December 2022.Experts, environment activists raise concernExperts and environment activists had earlier raised questions over the release of freshwater into the highly polluted nullah without eliminating the major sources of pollution.Col (retd) JS Gill said, “We are not against the project as it was needed to be undertaken but the timing is not good. The MC should have first dealt with the pollution.”“As there are still pollutants in the drain, releasing freshwater has sped up the process of polluting the Sutlej river. Pollutants including heavy metals will enter the Sutlej at a faster rate. The river is a source of drinking water for various districts of Rajasthan and southern parts of Punjab.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/releasing-freshwater-into-buddha-nullah-amid-criticism-cabinet-minister-ashu-claims-satisfactory-results-101629919758734.html

Even in 2017, the contractors had given consent to take up the works at 5% lesser amount, but now they are trying to blackmail the officials to loot the hard-earned money of taxpayers. If the contractors remain adamant, then the MC will convert the tenders and ready mix concrete roads will be constructed in place of bitumen ones,” the mayor said. Accusing the president of Ludhiana Hotmix Plant Welfare Association (bitumen contractors), Vinod Jain, of indulging in corrupt practices, the mayor said that Jain had been working in connivance of a senior Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader and they both were trying to malign the image of the Congress by trying to delay the development works ahead of the assembly elections. Speaking on the allegations of corruption levelled by the contractors, Sandhu said those were baseless without any evidence. “If they have any proof, then they should submit a formal complaint and I will take action regarding suspension and dismissal of officials concerned,” he added. Meanwhile, Jain — who had also accused Sandhu of being involved in the practice of charging commission for allotting contracts of development works to the contractors and releasing payments for completed works — said the mayor and the MC were now trying to “blackmail” the contractors after they blew the lid off their corrupt practices. “If I have been blacklisted, then why MC officials allotted road construction work to my firm a week ago. If I have done something wrong, then the mayor should mark an inquiry and take action against me. We will not be blackmailed. We have stopped the bitumen works in the city till the time these corrupt practices are not stopped by the MC. If required, we will also ask the other associations of contractors in the state to join our cause,” he added. Contractors stalled work fearing inspection: MC chiefLashing out at the contractors, MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “To keep a check on the quality of work done by contractors, the state government has directed the chief vigilance officer of the local bodies department to conduct inspections in the city. Fearing that the samples of work done by them will fail the quality tests, the contractors have announced to stall the projects by levelling false allegations on the MC officials.” He added that no compromise will be tolerated with the quality of work.Blacklisted contractor bags contract; inquiry markedMayor Sandhu said that Vinod Jain was blacklisted by MC last year over poor quality work, but it has come to his knowledge that he was still securing contracts by submitting bids through the firms of some other contractors. An inquiry has been marked in the case, the mayor said. Sandhu has also marked an inquiry over conversion of the dispensary site into a commercial building in Talab Bazaar area by Jain. Also, a report has been sought for the construction of a hotel in the Old City area by Jain in violation of parking and building bylaws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-mayor-slams-bitumen-contractors-for-maligning-congress-image-101629919699502.html

ASI Baldev Singh, who is investigating the case, said the police found a suicide note from the pocket of the victim wherein he has mentioned about Bharat, Aarti and an unidentified woman, who forced him to take the extreme step. The victim stated that the trio had borrowed ₹34,000 from him, but refused to return the money. The cop said the accused threatened the victim with implication in a sexual harassment case when he sought his money back. The ASI said the FIR has been registered under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the accused. A hunt is on to nab the trio, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/threatened-with-sexual-harassment-case-ludhiana-factory-worker-ends-life-101629919696574.html

The MC has paid the fine.”Last year in December, a monitoring committee of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had imposed a penalty of ₹2 lakh on the municipal council of Zirakpur for failing to implement proper solid waste management measures. The committee had also directed the civic body to streamline solid waste management in Zirakpur by January 31, 2021, but seven months on, nothing has been done.Sharma said, “Our team visited the dumping site of Zirakpur MC and found that they have not complied with the orders of the NGT committee. We have prepared a report and sent it to the higher authorities, recommending strict action against MC.”When contacted, Rajinder Singh, chief sanitary inspector of MC, Zirakpur, said, “We are in the process of complying with the recommendations of the NGT committee. I hope it will be done soon.”On the other hand, president of the joint action committee, Zirakpur, Sukhdev Chaudhary said, “Though the city is gasping for fresh air due to severe air pollution, the practice of setting garbage on fire is still going unchecked in several parts of Zirakpur. This is because there is no proper mechanism for disposal of solid waste in the city, and MC sweepers usually collect it in one corner and burn it, which makes breathing difficult for residents of nearby areas.” As per the action plan prepared for adopting measures for cleaner air in Mohali district, there is a need to curb incidents of garbage burning. Officials have been advised to educate their staff not to burn solid waste in the open. They have also been advised to install CCTV cameras at secondary garbage collection points, so that such incidents could be checked, but everything is on papers only, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/zirakpur-mc-fined-10-000-for-burning-solid-waste-101629919695558.html
26-08-2021||Chandigarh||Alarm scares ATM robbers away in Ludhiana||The alarm installed at an ATM near Mini Rose Garden in Daba scared away three masked thieves who had struck at the kiosk with an intention to loot in the wee hours of Wednesday. They, however, had fled from the spot before police or locals could reach. The miscreants have been captured in the CCTVs installed in the kiosk. The Division Number 6 police have initiated an investigation and are further scrutinising the surveillance footage to identify the trio.ASI Sona Singh, who is investigating the case, said according to the probe, the thieves arrived at the Axis Bank ATM around 3.20am. “They broke open the shutter and barged into the kiosk. They then sprayed black paint on the security cameras installed inside,” the ASI added. The accused had managed to take out the front plate of the ATM. Meanwhile, the security alarm went off and an alert was sent to the company’s headquarters in Mumbai. The officials there informed the local authorities and police. “The accused, in the meantime, managed to escape at 3.28am, leaving behind their spray paint cans,” the cop said. The police have registered an FIR following the complaint of Harpreet Singh of Bholapur, local head of the company that maintains ATMs in the city.The ASI added that two out of three miscreants were wearing turban. The accused had walked up to the ATM and ran towards the main road after the foiled robbery bid. The case has been registered under sections 457, 380, 511 and 34 of the IPC against the unidentified accused. A hunt is on to arrest them, the cop said.It is pertinent to mention here that the local police chief has already ordered that at least one security guard must be deputed at all ATMs located within the jurisdiction of Ludhiana police from 8pm to 6am. In his order issued under Section 144 of the CrPC, the police commissioner had said that no ATM would be allowed to be open without security personnel. Previous attacks on ATMsOn April 10, a gang of miscreants had burnt currency worth ₹19.5 lakh loaded in a State Bank of India (SBI) ATM in Ikolaha village of Khanna in an attempt to cut it open amid night curfew imposed in the region due to the coronavirus pandemic.In a similar incident on December 15, 2020, a robbers’ gang had burnt ₹5.32 lakh loaded in an ATM while trying to break it open in the wee hours. The ATM is located on Ferozepur Road opposite Verka milk plant, but no patrolling party or security men noticed it. The police came to know about the incident in the morning when the bank officials informed them.About two weeks before, on December 2, 2020, three masked robbers had taken away ₹26.37 lakh after cutting open an HDFC ATM in Lall Kalan village of Samrala in the wee hours. The ATM was unmanned as the bank had not deputed a security guard. The case still remain unsolved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/alarm-scares-atm-robbers-away-in-ludhiana-101629919694513.html

The situation has been caused by the Covid scenario, which remains fluid and limited international travel with restrictions galore. Magghar Singh, a small farmer from Moga, has mortgaged a chunk of his agricultural land for ₹4 lakh to buy an air ticket for his son for ₹3 lakh. His son is going there on a study visa. Canada has banned direct flights from India and also restricted the number of flights; some unscrupulous travel agents using this to make a fast buck by black-marketing tickets. Students are anxious to reach Canada as they fear flights could halt, if the third wave of Covid hits. Magghar Singh said, “My son applied for study visa a year ago and has been attending online classes. Now, flights are on, but ticket prices have jacked up. I had no option, but to mortgage land to arrange his travel.” As has been the common practice, Doaba-based travel agents book seats of flights to Canada, as a new semester in the universities there near and sell these at a fat profit to uneducated and gullible villagers. Kanwalpreet Singh, a Ludhiana-based travel agent, said, “Education abroad has become very expensive. Expenses on a study visa is between ₹17 lakh and ₹20 lakh for admission in business administration courses. With the high price of air tickets, parents have to shell out even more.”Narain Kaur of Lamme village of Jagraon has mortgaged her house to send her only son to Canada, who took admission in business administration. “If he reaches there and settles down, I will also go and live with him.” BOX PLEASERoute to Canada changed; negative Covid report mandatory With the coronavirus outbreak, flights to Canada are going via Mexico, Maldives, Doha and Albania. Passengers have to get tested for Covid here and only those with negative reports are allowed to continue to Canada. Jagjit Singh, a city based travel agent, said, “We instruct students not to handover their passports to anyone in Mexico, where gangs snatch students’ passports and return these only after money is paid to them. Even at hotel receptions, students have been instructed to submit only a copy of their passport and not handover the original document.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fare-up-five-fold-farmers-forced-to-mortgage-land-to-buy-air-tickets-to-canada-for-wards-101629919575009.html

The preparations were undertaken from the first week of July. An email ID was created – covidvacc2bedridden@gmail.com. The BMC received around 4,500 requests. The BMC said the vaccine beneficiary has to be bedridden for the past six months and will need a ‘fit to take vaccine’ certificate from his/her doctor. After the application, an appointment is scheduled at home and a doctor’s presence is mandated for the 30-minute observation, followed by signed consent of the beneficiary or family.According to the BMC data, as of Tuesday, 2,673 citizens have got their first dose and 76 their second dose. An official said, “There are times when citizens apply and do not pursue it further, there are times ineligible citizens also apply with the eligible citizen. They cite reasons like not being able to go out for vaccination considering they have to look after their bedridden relative. However, we do not give vaccines to relatives or family members of bedridden citizens.”Considering the BMC administers only Covaxin as per its policy, several beneficiaries who want Covishield or want a second dose of Covishield get ruled out of the programme.Along with the BMC’s team of doctors, nurses and ambulances, the vaccination is also being done with the help of NGO Project Mumbai, which has been assigned 12 of the total 24 administrative wards of the BMC. The NGO has so far vaccinated close to 1,000 beneficiaries of the total over 2,600 vaccinations done in homes. Shishir Joshi, CEO and founder of NGO Project Mumbai, said, “Of all the initiatives across the last 15 months, Project Mumbai has found immense satisfaction in this one – serving the bedridden. We also appeal to doctors who can volunteer 30 minutes of their time, to join the Project Mumbai team in this initiative. They can write to us on info@projectmumbai.org.”Meanwhile, on Wednesday, 54,634 citizens got the vaccine dose and till now 8,799,510 citizens have been vaccinated, of which 2,266,230 citizens are fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/doortodoor-vaccination-over-2-600-jabbed-in-a-month-says-mumbai-civic-body-101629919513956.html

During his visit, the President will inaugurate and unveil various infrastructural projects. Principal of the school Col Rajesh Raghav said, “President Ram Nath Kovind’s visit to our school will open a new chapter. His visit will be a momentous occasion in many ways.” Lt Gen Raj Shukla, PVSM, YSM, SM, Army Commander, ARTRAC and Vice Admiral Ajendra Bahadur Singh, AVSM, VSM Commanding-in-Chief (FOC-in-C), Eastern Naval Command of the Indian Navy will meet each other on August, 27 at their alma mater when the school will be decked up for its first presidential visit for the closing ceremony of diamond jubilee. Lt Gen Raj Shukla, studied in this school from January 8, 1974 to March 19, 1979. He joined the prestigious National Defence Academy, Khadakwasla, Pune in January 1979 (61st course). He got commissioned into the Regiment of Artillery in December 1982. Currently, he is 3rd senior most officer in the Indian Army. Vice Admiral Ajendra Bahadur Singh, commissioned on July 1, 1983 is an alumnus of National Defence Academy, Khadakwasla, Pune.

In a shock outcome, however, the outgoing president of the gurdwara body, SAD’s war-horse Manjinder Singh Sirsa, lost to former president Harvinder Singh Sarna in a fierce contest on the Punjabi Bagh seat.With an annual budget of at least ₹110 crore, management of nine historical gurdwaras and schools, colleges and hospitals with it, control over the gurdwara body also brings influence over global matters of the Sikh community, and a say in the government that runs the country. It takes around a month to form the new House.The SAD top brass sees the result as a practice match for the upcoming assembly polls in Punjab scheduled in early 2022. SAD (Delhi) that the Sarnas lead won 14 seats; former DSGMC president Manjit Singh GK, who fielded candidates representing the newly formed Jago Party shrunk to three seats; on two seats Independents have won. GK won on his home seat of Greater Kailash. Addressing a press conference in New Delhi, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal felicitated Sikhs of the national capital for voting his party again to power and announced that Sirsa would continue to head the gurdwara body, in spite of his loss. “He (Sirsa) will be nominated from the quota of (Amritsar-headquartered) Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC),” Sukhbir told the media. The head of the DSGMC becomes a leader of 8 lakh Sikhs of New Delhi and of Sikhs outside Punjab and the country. Under Sirsa, the DSGMC had caught the attention of the residents of the national capital, particularly the Sikhs, during the second Covid-19 wave; the gurdwara body had reached out to the victims with medical support, oxygen cylinders and concentrators. The body also offered langar (community meal) during the lockdown, which earned it lots of goodwill, helping it rise over negative perception it had earned after series of sacrilege incidents under the BJP-SAD regime in Punjab in 2015. “I know that both governments (Centre and the Delhi) worked against our party, particularly Sirsa. Despite this opposition, we won,” said Sukhbir, adding, “This victory is a prelude to my party’s comeback in Punjab polls. Those who played politics over sacrilege will lose.”Under the DSGMC Act of 1971, a 51-member House runs the gurdwara body. Over and above 46 elected members, there is a provision to nominate one member (from the SGPC quota), two members come via co-option and two more come from the Singh Sabhas (local gurdwaras) in Delhi. For SAD (Delhi) president Paramit Singh Sarna, the results came as a shock. “We hoped to do much better, but we accept that the voters have the final say.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hattrick-for-sad-in-dsgmc-house-sirsa-loses-but-to-remain-president-101629919156184.html

Why was action not taken against him and why only against me? Whatever I spoke was out of anger against Thackeray for forgetting the year of independence of our country,” said Rane in a press conference in Mumbai on Wednesday.BJP leaders said it would expose ministers of the ruling MVA — comprising Sena, NCP and Congress — over their roles in various cases and added it would move court against Sena leaders over its ‘”misuse of power”, especially transport minister Anil Parab.A video clip of Parab apparently asking Ratnagiri police to arrest 69-year-old Rane without waiting for an arrest warrant went viral. Taking an aggressive stance against chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, the BJP raised questions why action was not taken against him when he had used abusive language in the past against senior BJP leaders such as Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Aditynath and Union home minister Amit Shah.“I cannot tolerate anything against our nation, our society or BJP leaders [on his statement against Thackeray]. If my remarks are objectionable, the instigating and derogatory language by the CM does not amount to similar action?,” Rane said. He also said that the BJP would not allow West Bengal-like [poll] violence to take place in Maharashtra. Raising questions over the violent protests and law-and-order situation in the state, Rane said, “Sena has no power to beat up any BJP worker or leader. They pelt stones from distance. BJP would not allow the violence to take place here in Maharashtra like it happened in West Bengal (after assembly polls).”The Union minister was arrested on Tuesday afternoon for his remark made during the ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’ of his party the previous day that he would have slapped Thackeray over the latter’s “ignorance” of the year of India’s independence, triggering a political row and protests across the state on Tuesday. After his arrest, Rane was taken to Mahad in Raigad district, 165km from Mumbai, where an FIR was registered against him over the remark. He was granted bail by a court at Mahad late on Tuesday night. Rane is the first sitting central minister to be arrested in two decades, since Murasoli Maran and TR Baalu were picked up in an infamous midnight raid in Chennai by the Tamil Nadu Police in 2001.After the high-voltage drama witnessed in Mumbai, Konkan and other parts of the state on Tuesday over Rane’s arrest, BJP alleged that ïnhumane treatment” was meted out to the Union minister during his detention out of vendetta.The party also threatened to move court against Sena leader and transport minister Anil Parab for his orders to the police to arrest Rane by using police force. Parab, a close aide of Thackeray, was caught on camera of a television channel, giving instructions to someone- — apparently a police officer -— to arrest Rane without waiting for an arrest warrant and use force if necessary.“He asked the police to arrest Rane without warrant. We are moving court to understand in which capacity he was giving orders to the police. We are also moving court against Sena leader and deputy chairman of legislative council Neelam Gorhe for her political statement. The government has been acting with political vegeance by misusing the police force. The action against Rane came out of the fear of losing Mumbai after the type of response the Jan Ashirwad Yatra received in Mumbai,” said Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil.BJP leader and former minister Ashish Shelar has demanded a CBI probe in the entire episode of the arrest order by Parab. “The leaked video clip was shot between 11 and 1pm on Tuesday when the hearing on bail application by Rane in high court and the session court had yet to begin. Despite which, he told the IPS officer on other side that the application was rejected. He also orders the officer to arrest Union minister by using force. The entire episode is shaky and needs to be investigated by a central agency like CBI,” he said. BJP’s district vice president from Nallasopara, Vishwas Sawant, has filed an FIR against Parab for ‘misuse of power’.There was no reaction from Shiv Sena on the Parab issue or Thackeray’s past remarks on BJP leaders.BJP meanwhile is still gauging the repercussion and the impact of the entire episode on their prospects in the forthcoming local body elections in the state. Senior party leaders have been very cautious while giving statements over the Rane remarks against Thackeray and said that they do not justify it. “Though the aggressive style of politics of Rane is liked by a section of leaders in the party, others fear it may backfire if Sena manages to portray it as an insult to the state. We have also apprehension that it may turn in favour of Sena. Sena workers are galvanized if their pride towards party and leadership was hurt. Though we are firm on standing by Rane during this episode, there would be an assessment within party over its long-term stand over it,” said a senior BJP leader requesting anonymity.BJP had strategically inducted Rane in the union cabinet last month to utilise him against Sena in Maharashtra. The party believes that the firebrand leader, who is staunch opponent of Sena for more than 15 years, could help the party in denting Sena on its home turf in Mumbai and Konkan.The high voltage drama began on Tuesday morning after Nashik Police issued an arrest order on Tuesday morning against Narayan Rane for his statement against chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Rane was arrested from Sangameshwar in Ratnagirin in the evening and was granted bail at midnight at district court in Mahad. Rane got relief from further action till September 17 by the Bombay high court. Police have been restrained from any action or summons against him till next hearing.The political protest by Sena and BJP workers continued on Wednesday. BJP held protests at Nashik, Shirdi, Nanded to condemn the arrest of the union minister and demanding action against Sena workers for attack on their offices. The BJP workers also burnt the copies of Sena mouthpiece Saamana in parts of Konkan. Sena workers, too, held protests in Jalna, Yavatmal to condemn the statement by Rane. Cases against more than 130 people were registered in Nashik on the party workers from Sena and BJP for the clash between them on Tuesday.Meanwhile, Shiv Sena workers continued to threaten Rane over his remarks. Party’s Hingoli legislator Santosh Bangar while talking to the media dared Rane to remove his security and face him. “We have the strength to come and bash you at your house. You keep your police protection aside. I, Santosh Bangar, a Sena activist will come alone and if I don’t remove your guts then I will never take my name again,”Bangar was seen threatening on various Marathi TV channels.BJP legislator Ram Kadam said the party would like to see the action taken by the Sena-led government. “These are all empty threats, but since they are made by the legislator we would like to see what action will be taken against Bangar for threatening a union minister,” said Kadam. He said that BJP’s restraint should not be seen as a weakness by the Sena.Sena defended Bangar saying it was a reaction to the action. “Shiv Sainiks are emotional about their chief and Narayan Rane provoked them with such insulting remarks. It’s Rane’s fault that is facing such backlash,” said Sena spokesperson Manisha Kayande.Nitesh, Rane’s younger son and BJP MLA tweeted a video indicating that the befitting reply will be given for the action against his father. He also criticized CM Thackeray for felicitating party workers involved in violent protests outside Rane’s Juhu house on Tuesday.During a press conference in Mahad on Monday, Rane passed a controversial remark against Thackeray. Referring to the mis-reference given by the CM about the number of years to the Independence day, Rane said that he would have given a tight slap had he been present there. Thackeray had confused between the Hirak and Amrut Mahotsav of independence during his speech at Mantralaya on August 15. He had to enquire about it with the chief secretary of state standing behind him.“It is shameful that the chief minister does not know the year of independence. He leaned back to enquire (with his aides) about the count of years of independence during his speech. Had I been there, I would have given him a slap,” Rane had said.Four FIRs were registered against him by Sena workers against Rane seeking his arrest.Claiming that the he was not arrested by police, but he accompanied them in his own car on their request, Rane said on Wednesday that the yatra would not stop. Rane also said that the party would not keep quite until the death case of Disha Salian was taken to the logical end of the involvement of a minister in the case. He said that the BJP would fight the legal battle in legitimate way to ensure that the minister get punished for his involvement in the case. The union minister also hit out at Shiv Sena and said that they should brace for the reaction of an attempt of attack his Juhu residence on Tuesday.Sindhudurg collector K Manjulaxmi has on Tuesday imposed prohibitory orders banning assembly of more than five people for next 15 days. The order, however, would not prohibit the Jan Ashirwad Yatra by Narayan Rane, officials from collectorate said.Shiv Sena leader and Guhagar MLA Bhaskar Jadhav said that Shiv Sena was not against the Jan Ashirwad Yatra by Rane. “Shiv Sena is not against Jan Ashirwad Yatra and if he wants to resume it in Sindhudurg he may apply for the official permissions from the administration. It’s up to the administration to concede it or not, but curfew in Sindhudurg has not been imposed to oppose the Yatra. It was imposed keeping the history of violence in the district during the political clashes in mind. After yesterday’s arrest, Rane would not dare to use any foul language against our leader. He has given such undertaking in the court. We wish that he holds his Yatra the way it is as expected by his leadership,” he said.Shiv Sena leader and spokesperson Sachin Ahir said, “The law is equal for all. We do not deny it, but Rane has been targetting our party and leadership continuously without any reason for last two years since our government is formed in the state. Whatever Uddhavji has been speaking against leaders from BJP has been political reaction over the issues pertaining to that particular time. We do not justify the violence and objectional language used by our workers, but it’s out of the reaction to the remarks by Rane. Action has been taken against them as well.”Sena’s Guhagar MLA and former miniser Bhaskar Jadhav said, “Rane too should think why aggressive reaction came over his reaction and why the Jan Ashirwad Yatra by other three union ministers concluded without any hindrance. The remarks by Rane were out of frustration and a deliberate attempt to provoke Sena leadership.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-narayan-rane-up-heat-on-shiv-sena-over-slap-row-101629918914505.html
26-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai univ 2nd merit list out: Popular colleges, courses witness 1-3% points drop in cut-offs||Blame it on the bloated marks awarded to Class 12 students this year or the fear among students of being left without a seat, several city colleges witnessed a slight drop of 1-3 percentage points in cut-offs.In some cases, college only had a handful of vacant seats left to offer in the second merit list, ensuring that the cut-off dipped not even by a single per cent point. While in other cases, colleges had no second list to announce for popular courses.“All the open category seats were allotted in the first merit list itself, and with no withdrawal of admissions, we had no seat left to allot in the second merit list on Wednesday,” said Rajendra Shinde, principal of St Xavier’s College. The FYBA course of the institute has been a popular destination for students for many years now. Last year too, the college could manage only a single general merit list for the same course. While the college said it was helpless, students were dejected with this news. “When I saw the first merit list for the FYBA course at St Xavier’s end at 99.17% for students from other boards, I had no hope for the cut-offs to drop much in the second list. Still, many of us were shocked to find out that all seats were taken in the first list itself, leaving us with no hope of getting into the college anymore,” said Anusha Pandya, who scored 96% in her Class 12 exams and was hoping to bag a seat in St Xavier’s. She, however, has been allotted a seat in another top college, which was second on her preference list. At RA Podar College in Matunga, the second list for the FYBCom course ended at 95.7% less than a per cent point lower than the first merit list. Even the BMS course, across streams, dropped by a per cent point in the second list. At Ramnarain Ruia College as well, the FYBA list dropped only by a per cent point. “It is a popular course among students these days and I feel the fear of the pandemic and fierce competition this year, students aren’t withdrawing admissions as easily as they did earlier, leaving maximum seats taken in the first round itself,” said Anushree Lokur, principal of the college. At Narsee Monjee College, the cutoffs for FYBCom, BCom in Financial Management (BFM) and BCom in Accounting and Finance (BFM) dropped by a percentage point or less, compared to the first merit list. Similarly, at Mithibai College, cutoffs for FYBA and FYBCom dropped less than one percentage point.In the first merit list announced last week, several colleges witnessed an 8-10% point increase compared to last year and most attributed the hike to high Class 12 marks across boards.Rising Covid-19 cases forced most school education boards to scrap Class 12 board exams this year and instead promote students based on their performance in Class 10, 11 and 12 following a 30:30:40 formula. This pushed the overall performance of students from all boards—while CBSE and ISC schools witnessed a hike in the number of students scoring 90% and 95% in their batches, the state board witnessed a 12-fold rise in the number of students scoring 90% and above this year, including 46 students who scored a perfect 100% in HSC this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-univ-2nd-merit-list-out-popular-colleges-courses-witness-1-3-points-drop-in-cutoffs-101629918674656.html

The high court bench of justice Arvind Sangwan, said that the lawyer, Prateek Pandit, will deposit the cost with the High Court Legal Services Authority within 15 days. After depositing the cost, it will be open for him to recover the amount from the Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association, and in case the amount is not paid to him, he can claim/adjust it against his subscription/membership fee, the court said further. The call to abstain from work was given by the Bar body. The lawyer had moved an application for advancing the hearing in a bail case of a drug peddling accused. The case was listed for October 28. As court took up the application, the lawyer informed the judge that the case was earlier listed on August 11, but he could not appear as the whole fraternity had volunteered to abstain from work that day. “Despite the fact that the courts are working through virtual mode with great difficulties having lots of connectivity issues, the lawyers resorted to abstain from work on August 11. In view of the same, finding no ground for early hearing, the present application is dismissed with cost of ₹1,000,” the bench ordered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-hc-fines-lawyer-1-000-says-he-can-recover-it-from-bar-body-101629918554406.html
26-08-2021||Chandigarh||Carpooling: Chandigarh admn junks draft policy, to adopt Centre’s guidelines||The Chandigarh administration has junked its draft carpooling policy and would implement the central guidelines on the issue. The ministry guidelines for carpooling by private vehicles through cab aggregators were issued in November 2020. The city has the highest density of vehicle in the country and battles traffic congestion. The draft policy, now junked, aimed to encourage and regulate carpooling. The policy envisaged that people share vehicles when going to a common destination. Dedicated mobile apps were to be developed to ensure security, registration of vehicles for the service, registration of users and real-time tracking of vehicles. The policy also included mandatory police verification of the driver’s antecedents. The Standing Committee on Transport of the administrator’s Advisory Council has been informed that the UT transport department had prepared a draft carpooling was prepared, but not notified. “The committee was told that the administration would go by the ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) guidelines on carpooling,” said a senior UT official privy to the development. The issue of carpooling was raised in the committee for ensuing better last-mile connectivity. The development of the mobile app, to be outsourced, was to be regulated by the state transport authority. It was to be designed on the lines of available mobile-enabled taxi services or aggregators. The administration had formulated the draft policy on directions of the Niti Aayog. What are the guidelinesIn November last year, the Union ministry had issued guidelines, ‘Motor Vehicle Aggregators Guidelines 2020’. The guidelines deal primarily with the regulatory framework for ride hailing apps like Uber, Ola and others. Under the guidelines, the ministry has allowed private car owners to offer pooling services. The guidelines state, “For reducing traffic congestion and pollution, non-transport vehicle pooling may be provided by aggregators.” The option for carpooling through private vehicles can be in-built in the aggregator’s hailing app. According to these guidelines, a maximum of four ride-sharing intra-city rides in a day and two inter-city trips per week are to be permitted for each vehicle with the driver, integrated with the aggregator. The integrated vehicle will have to obtain an insurance of at least ₹5 lakh for the ride-sharers, other than the owner or driver integrated with the aggregator, the guidelines added. Under the UT’s draft policy, however, carpooling was not to be a commercial enterprise. Commuters were to charged only the cost and no pick-up of commuters was to be allowed from bus stops, bus stand, or taxi stands. The aim was that people going from one location to another should share the vehicle rather than opt for individual cars. Hence, no soliciting of passengers was to be allowed on road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/carpooling-chandigarh-admn-junks-draft-policy-to-adopt-centre-s-guidelines-101629918196795.html
26-08-2021||Mumbai||Procedure for first-ever caste census in Maharashtra since independence finalised||The Maharashtra State Commission for Backward Classes (MSCBC) has finalised the empirical data collection format and norms for the massive Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) proposed in the state. The census, which is being launched almost a century after it was last undertaken in British India, is expected to cost around ₹435 crore and cover all households. An MSCBC member said that they finalised the questionnaire for the census in a meeting of the commission at Pune on Wednesday. “This will combine the questionnaire and data chart used by the Central government for its 2011 SECC exercise and the general census proposed in 2021. The proposal will be sent to the state government by Tuesday,” he added. The state government is yet to give a nod for caste census though Other Backward Class (OBC) ministers in the MVA government are demanding the same. This data will cover details of individual households, their caste location and political representation. It will seek information about the caste, sub-caste, religion, educational and employment status, migration details, type of house, source of drinking water, fuel used for cooking, vehicles owned and whether these families have access to toilets, mobile phones, computers and internet services, to assess their social backwardness.The SECC, which aims at collecting empirical data to restore political reservations for the other backward classes (OBCs), will also verify if any member of the family for the last three generations, had contested and won any elections to gauge their political backwardness.The member said they wanted the exercise to be undertaken by the state government to ensure authenticity. This data will be analysed by the commission. However, the time taken to complete the census will depend on the state government. The MSCBC members plan to meet chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and other ministers in Mumbai to discuss this.At present, the Central government collects data only for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in the decadal census and has refused to enumerate other populations in the 2021 census.The proposed SECC will be crucial for restoring political reservations for OBCs in local self-government bodies like municipal corporations, councils, zilla parishads and gram panchayats.In March, the Supreme Court (SC) struck down Maharashtra’s 27% political quota for OBCs due to the lack of empirical data about their backwardness. It said that the state can grant these reservations after setting up a backward class commission to conduct an empirical inquiry into the nature and implications of their backwardness.This may lead to blowback for the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) regime with the OBCs being upset over losing 57,000 seats. The elections to 18 municipal corporations including Mumbai are scheduled next year, while the term of three corporations is already over.“This exercise will also generate rich data across castes and religions… similarly, it will help the commission take scientific decisions on inclusion and exclusion of sections in the backward classes,” he explained.While the SECC is expected to cost ₹435 crore, this also includes the allowance to be paid to enumerators. This can be changed or lowered by the government to reduce these costs.Caste-based censusThe references to a caste census are found in the Rigveda and Kautilya Arthashastra. Emperor Akbar’s minister Abul Fazal mentions a comprehensive caste-based census.Now, only data about SCs and STs is collected in the censusOBCs are expected to be around 53% of Maharashtra’s population (43.70% Hindus and 8.40% non-Hindus).The Maharashtra assembly has approved a resolution seeking a caste-based census. However, the Centre has refused to enumerate caste-wise populations other than Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) in the 2021 Census.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/procedure-for-first-ever-caste-census-in-maharashtra-since-independence-finalised-101629918195735.html
26-08-2021||Other||To check land acquisition fraud, NHAI asks districts not to allow CLUs till it finishes surveys||Jalandhar The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has requested district administrations to not issue No-Objection Certificates (NOCs) for change in land use, sale deed, or registries till it completes its final surveys in areas where it is planning to acquire land for its road projects. After the survey, the NHAI issues a baseline notification that acts as the master document for land acquisition.The apprehension of the NHAI is that such land conversions, sale deed, registries etc are meant to take undue advantage of the fact that a road will pass through the areas concerned. As soon as news filters out that a new road is to be built, rates of land in and around the area increase and private owners get undue compensation, earning a windfall. The NHAI wants to curb any fraud is such major big-ticket projects. In the latest instance, the NHAI has written to the Hoshiarpur deputy commissioner to pass stay order on change in land use or sale or registries till it completes its survey on four-laning the Hoshiarpur-Phagwara road. Hoshiarpur deputy commissioner Apneet Riyait confirmed the development, adding that the needful would be done. In 2019, the NHAI had detected major irregularities in the land acquisition process for widening of the Bathinda-Sangat Kalan road as the nature of 177 khasras (plots) of land was changed from agriculture to commercial in an attempt to give undue compensation to private landowners. In its communication to the Hoshiarpur DC, the NHAI says, “Land acquisition proceedings have been initiated by NHAI and verification of survey number of patwaris falling in the alignment is under progress for four-laning of existing two-lane highway from Phagwara to Hoshiarpur including Phagwara and Hoshiarpur bypass.”It adds, “The alignment of the subject project stretch is now easily accessible and the possibility of leakage of sensitive information cannot be ruled out. There are high chances of conversion of land or sale/ purchase of land falling in the alignment.”Finally, the NHAI adds, “Such instances of conversion have been reported in Punjab previously too, resulting in dropping the proposal of development of highways or extra cost and arbitration cases or land disputes.”A senior NHAI official, seeking anonymity, said the district administrations were being told to vigilant against such profiteering. Hoshiarpur-based Right to Information (RTI) activist, Rajiv Vashisht, who is a whistle-blower in Hoshiarpur land acquisition scam, said, “The NHAI has taken a big step towards stopping land acquisition frauds that the land mafia perpetrates in a nexus with government officials.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/to-check-land-acquisition-fraud-nhai-asks-districts-not-to-allow-clus-till-it-finishes-surveys-101629918194472.html

26-08-2021||Other||HP restarts process to set up state disaster response force||Days after landslides wreaked havoc in the tribal Kinnaur district, Himachal Pradesh government has once again started the process to set up a State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), which has been caught in red tape for years.Principal secretary, revenue, Onkar Sharma and director general of police Sanjay Kundu held a meeting to chalk out the modalities for setting up a dedicated response force for the state. “It was decided that three companies of the SDRF will be set up in the state. The police department has already purchased necessary equipments for carrying out disaster rescue operations while the government has also approved 356 posts of police personnel, including technical staff, for the force,” said Onkar Sharma.The proposal to set up an SDRF was drawn up in 2011, following the National Disaster Management Authority’s directions to all states, but it has been hanging fire since then. In 2013, following the floods in Kinnaur, the then Congress government had asked all departments concerned to speed up the process to set up an SDRF. The state police had then come up with a plan to raise three companies of SDRF – one each in Pandoh of Mandi, Dharamshala and Shimla—but it never saw the light of the day.Why the state need a dedicated force urgentlyHimachal Pradesh falls in seismic zone five, making it prone to high-intensity earthquakes. Besides, calamities such as cloudburst, flashfloods, landslides, forest fires and avalanches are common in the hill state. This year alone, heavy rain, floods, cloudbursts, landslides and related incidents have claimed over 309 lives in the state. Besides, the state has also witnessed loss of property to the tune of ₹876.54 crore, owing to these disasters. But every time a disaster strikes, the state is forced to seek help from the National Disaster Response Force, paramilitary and army for relief and rescue operations. Across the country, as many as 23 states have already set up SDMA. Eleven people still missing As per a report, since June 13 when monsoon started in Himachal, 147 people have died in road accidents while landslides have killed 51 people. Ten people died in cloudburst and 28 due to drowning while the remaining casualties occurred in other incidents. The maximum 44 people died in Kinnaur, the tribal district battered by frequent landslides this year. In a major landslide on July 26, nine people were killed after shooting stones hit a tourist vehicle at Batseri in Sangla area of the district. Twenty-eight people were killed when a major landslide buried a Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) bus, an SUV and several other vehicles. As many as 43 people have died in Shimla, 31 each in Kangra and Chamba and 29 each Sirmaur. Heavy rains have damaged more than 800 houses and 550 cowsheds across, and 16 shops across the state. More than 580 cattle head have been lost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hp-restarts-process-to-set-up-state-disaster-response-force-101629918075764.html

The committee will submit its report by September 15.Dhumman Singh Kirmach, vice-chairman of the Haryana Saraswati Heritage Development Board, said the decision to include history of Saraswati river in school curriculum has been taken jointly by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar (who is chairman of the Board) and state education minister Kanwar Pal.Since Saraswati river has an old history and was flowing through many districts of Haryana, the decision to include it in the school curriculum will help impart knowledge about it to the younger generations.Kirmach said Saraswati is one of the oldest rivers of India and has a different historical and mythological significance as Indian culture developed along the banks of the river.During the seven year stint in Haryana, the BJP-led government had taken steps to revive Saraswati river from Adi-Badri in Yamunanagar.While addressing a seminar on ‘Saraswati river: new perspectives and heritage development’ during the ongoing International Saraswati Festival 2021 in February, Khattar had announced a budget of ₹800 crore for construction of dam barrage and reservoir as part of the Saraswati river rejuvenation project.A study conducted by the Centre of Excellence for Research on the Saraswati River (CERSR) at Kurukshetra University had revealed that Saraswati river was flowing in Haryana until 1402 AD and all major archaeological sites in Haryana (Siswal, Rakhigarhi, Banawali, Bhirrana, Kunal, Balu, Thana) were located at a radial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/history-of-ancient-saraswati-river-to-be-taught-in-haryana-schools-101629917895677.html

26-08-2021||Delhi||Learn from past experience with FYUP, say stakeholders||The last time the Delhi University introduced the four-year undergraduate programme (FYUP) in 2013, widespread protests swept across the varsity, undergraduate admissions were delayed, and rival groups clashed on the campus in June 2014, leading to injuries to students and teachers. Almost after an year of uncertainty over admissions under the new regime and unprecedented opposition by both students and faculty, the FYUP was scrapped in 2014.As the central university is all set to introduce the system from the next academic session, the students of the 2013-14 batch said on Wednesday that it is crucial to draw on past experience ahead of the implementation of the new system.Former DU V-C Dinesh Singh, who was at the helm when FYUP was last introduced, and a strong votary of the system, appreciated the move on Wednesday. “A lot of hard work went into the implementation of the FYUP during my time. Such ideas are not born in a minute. They are based on many years of experience. I congratulate the academic council of the university for passing the proposal,” said Singh. He gave credit to Dr K Kasturirangan, who is the head of the drafting committee on National Education Policy (NEP), for incorporating the FYUP into the NEP.Singh said the FYUP paved the way for learning that was not confined to “notes”. “The number of startups, research papers, and patents that were brought out by the undergraduate students in that one year was amazing. Our global rankings also improved post the FYUP. We ran a lot of innovation programmes that gave students an actual experience of learning and putting it into practice,” he said.When asked about the dissent by at least 16 academic council members to the passing of FYUP on Tuesday, Singh said a difference in opinion did not necessarily mean that the programme or teachers opposing the programme were wrong. “It will always be difficult for everyone to arrive at a consensus,” he said.A section of teachers in DU, however, were guarded in their reaction to the new system. They said it is crucial to ensure that mistakes from the past are not repeated.Delhi University Teachers Association (DUTA) treasurer Abha Dev Habib said though the model has been passed, teachers will continue to strive to ensure that a movement is built against the “dilution of the course”. “Students rejected the idea of FYUP because of the dilution of the first two years of FYUP. We see that the new model once again packs the first two semesters with lukewarm courses. However, we will continue to strive and ensure that past mistakes are not repeated. We will do whatever we can to tweak it or oppose it within the system and beyond,” said Habib.Manoj Sinha, principal of Aryabhatta College, said unlike the last time, FYUP has been properly debated this time before being brought in. “This is a plan for the whole country. There is a huge difference between FYUP of 2013 and the one that has been floated now. At this moment, we can’t say if it will fail or pass based on past experience. Last time, we had to plan and decide many things. This time, planning has been done by experts at a much larger scale,” said Sinha.He said as far as its implementation is concerned, issues can be discussed further. “We don’t have too many choices and while there are apprehensions regarding the implementation, these issues can be discussed and debated,” said Sinha.Sunil Kumar, a member of the teachers’ group, the National Democratic Teachers’ Front (NDTF), said it was crucial to remember that the erstwhile FYUP and the current programme are different from each other. Supporting the new regime, he said, “DU academic council also understands that a false equivalence between the previous FYUP and the present 3/4 years UG /Hons programmes need not to be established. The two are fundamentally different.” The group said that the three years honours degree has been retained, and the FYUP will allow students to directly join PhD programmes.Mahamedha Nagar, who was enrolled in English (Hons) at Miranda House in the first batch of FYUP students, recalled that her first year of graduation was a messy affair. “Our classes will extend till 5-6 pm since we had a number of foundation courses. These foundation courses were often unrelated and disconnected from the core programmes that we had due to which many students didn’t see any merit in these courses. As an English (Hons) student, I was not interested in taking up Mathematics or science courses, but as part of the FYUP batch, I had to study for my main subjects in addition to foundation classes in Maths and computers in the evening hours,” said Nagar.She said the requirement of completion of foundation courses created hurdles for students who were not familiar with the English language. “Students pursuing Hindi (Hons) and Sanskirt (Hons) were made to study courses in English. It was difficult for them to adjust to the wide-array of courses that were often taught in English,” said Nagar.Like the 2013 foundation courses,the mandatory courses introduced in the first year this time include papers on environmental science, ethics and culture, social and emotional learning. Teachers said it was only repackaged and will not benefit students like 2013.“Two credit courses of the erstwhile FYUP mind-body-heart type have been reintroduced as Social and Emotional Learning and Entrepreneurship and Co-curricular Activities. DU had such a disastrous experience with such types of courses and clearly it has not learnt from past experiences,” said a note by 16 teachers who dissented in the academic council meeting that passed FYUP on Tuesday.Parul Oberoi, who pursued journalism from Delhi University, said FYUP was an “unnecessary intervention” that created hurdles for a number of students. Oberoi said while the idea of FYUP was to impart education at par with the global education structure, the implementation of the programme did not serve the purpose. “We were being taught courses that were of no relevance to us. They were not adding any value to our core concentration,” said Oberoi.Chhavi Mangleek, another student from the 2013 FYUP batch, recalled that the insistence on foundation courses was unnecessary. “No one wants to devote time to courses that will not benefit them. It was long, hectic, and unnecessary. We had classes till late evening and courses on business, entrepreneurship, mathematical activity among others, despite my course courses being journalism,” said Mangleek.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/learn-from-past-experience-with-fyup-say-stakeholders-101629917423779.html
26-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: CTU buses go secure, smart on tricity routes||The Chandigarh Transport Undertaking’s ambitious intelligent transport system for its buses running on the tricity routes became operational for the 358-strong fleet on Wednesday.In comes a year after a trial run was conducted with 100 buses on 14 routes in August last year.UT administrator VP Singh Badnore on Wednesday launched the state-of-the-art command and control centre (CCC) and smart cards under the intelligent transport system (ITS) project. The CCC, which is housed at the Inter State Bus Terminal (ISBT) in Sector 43, will monitor the city bus operations in real time.The ITS project also comprises automatic vehicle location system and passenger information system, automatic fare collection system and depot management system. A part of the ministry of housing and urban affairs’ project for efficient and sustainable city bus service, it is partially funded by the World Bank.How it will help commutersCommuters will be able to live track buses. The expected time of arrival/departure will be displayed on screens installed at the ISBTs in Sectors 17 and 43, railway station and 37 bus queue shelters besides being made available on a mobile app (trycityBus). Users will also be able to use a journey planner feature on the app. A grievance redressal management system is also inbuilt in the app. A slew of security features have been introduced in the buses. There will be four cameras inside each bus to monitor the behaviour of the crew and passengers. At a time, the central command and control centre can live monitor 24 buses through these cameras. For additional security of passengers, particularly women, a panic button is available. Even drivers can have a direct line of communication with the control room.Smart cards will be available for e-ticketing as well as concessional travel. Commuters can recharge their smart cards from customer service points at the two ISBTs and e-sampark centres or through the app or web portal (ctuportal.amnex.com). Initially, 10,000 smart cards will be issued for free, and only printing charges will be taken. Thereafter, ₹100 will be levied for a smart card. The minimum recharge will be of ₹100 with a cap at ₹5,000.How it will benefit CTUFor CTU, the system will help in tracking the number of buses scheduled out of the total buses at the depot, number of buses enroute and Idle, number of routes/trips in operation, bus and crew allocation, whether buses are sticking to the schedule and realtime cash collection. It will also help in reducing cash handling and revenue leakage with the use of smart cards.“In case a bus is late or not sticking to a designated route, or if it jumps a light or speeds, the ITS will alert the officials concerned so that immediate corrective measures can be taken. In the long run, it will allow the department to rationalise bus routes in line with passenger traffic,” said a CTU official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-ctu-buses-go-secure-smart-on-tricity-routes-101629917116926.html
26-08-2021||Delhi||2013 rerun: Unsure of FYUP in Delhi University, say teachers||Even as Delhi University’s Academic Council, on Tuesday, passed the agenda to start a four-year undergraduate programme (FYUP) from the next academic session amid dissent, stakeholders, including college principals and teachers have expressed concern over how the model will be implemented after a tumultuous year caused by a global pandemic.The AC passed the broad course structure along with a multiple entry-exit scheme (MEES) and academic bank of credits (ABC) on Tuesday amid dissent from 16 members, but the matter is now scheduled to be placed in the Executive Council on August 31. AC member Alok Pandey said that since EC only has two elected teacher representatives out of around 40 members, it is likely to be passed there too.“While FYUP emphasises on research, there is no model to teach students research methodology or how to do dissertation work. This may also lead to students opting for dishonest means to submit their theses. The Covid-19 pandemic has already been a challenge for the stakeholders; this will just add to the crisis. The National Education Policy (NEP) encourages blended learning, but if our students do not have devices or internet as was evident in the past year, how will they conduct research? On their phones?” Pandey said.Acting vice-chancellor PC Joshi said DU has only adopted a broad course structure for now and the university will finalise the modalities in the coming days.“Departments and faculties will be allowed to introduce alterations in the broad structure as we have only accepted this in principle for now. We have a year to see how the framework can be operationalised in the context of DU. We will change our system gradually to adapt to it and for now, we are moving in the direction of NEP,” he said.Currently, the recommendations adopted by AC provide little clarity on the system of examination and student intake across regular and non-collegiate courses. Teachers also said that the progression of papers will have to be changed as the entry-exit process has to be self-contained every year.AC member Naveen Gaur explained, “If students opt for MEES, they would want a self-contained unit every year so that they could learn everything and go for the interdisciplinary approach stated in NEP. But as per the current structure, if a student exits after the first year where there is no general elective paper, the student will not study another subject allowing multidisciplinary approach in the first year.”In the agenda document passed on Tuesday, the university had stated that it would decide upon the modalities for the ABC – MEES later based on further dialogue within statutory bodies. The two schemes allow students to gain credits as per their learning, store them in a digital vault, and use them to switch courses and resume their study at any point if they have to exit the course after the first, second, or third year. Officials said they were yet to decide on the list of universities it would allow for the ABC system or the entrance test that would be mandatory for students of other universities to switch to DU through MEES.While the teaching community raised concern over the reduction of workload that would arise due to the implementation of these provisions, university officials said they had deferred the agenda items as there had been no consensus. For instance, 57% of credits under FYUP with research can be earned from other universities or institutes including Swayam, an online repository of courses.“Since there were concerns over Swayam and MOOC, that agenda item was deferred and it hasn’t been adopted. Since UGC has allowed up to 40% online learning, we will hold more discussions with stakeholders to see what should be implemented in the university so that both teachers and students benefit from it,” Joshi said.EC member Seema Das said that colleges do not have the infrastructure to implement an additional academic year. “Higher educational institutes have been facing a fund crunch for a long time. Implementing the provisions laid down in NEP would require infrastructure expansion. It cannot be done without resources,” she said.In the dissent note submitted on Tuesday, 16 AC members collectively noted, “Most colleges do not have any space or scope for further expansion. Neither is there any promise of additional grants for creating infrastructure nor has any study been done of the current state in the institution.”Manoj Sinha, principal of Aryabhatta College and general secretary of DU principals’ association, said, “We will need increased human resources and infrastructure in a gradually phased manner in the next three-four years. Since NEP calls for developing research facilities, we require labs and lab attendants but the non-teaching positions are not being sanctioned by the authorities for the last few years. While older colleges have sanctioned posts and lab attendants, newer colleges like ours has zero attendants. In order to encourage research, more grants will have to be facilitated as well.”However, SP Aggarwal, principal of Ramanujan College who was part of the 42-member committee formed by Delhi University to formulate recommendations on NEP, said major changes will come into effect in the fourth year when one semester would increase per semester cycle. This means colleges have time to make the necessary upgrades.“Since FYUP was in place before as well, we have some experience in how the teaching schedules work. Colleges will have three years to develop the infrastructure and will require funding to boost infrastructure because if there is an additional academic year, we will need classrooms, labs, staff and information technology facilities. Some colleges require major investment in IT facilities as the university is also adopting ABC credits and many students may opt for online learning,” Aggarwal said.Addressing teacher concerns on the reduction of workload, Aggarwal said that the proposed NEP structure still has more credits than other four-year programmes in foreign universities. “Learners will be affected if they are burdened with more credits. Instead of focusing on increasing credits to counter the loss of workload, we should focus on bringing the teacher-student ratio to international standards,” he said.Several AC members and teachers also said that introducing another academic year meant an increase in additional costs. Registrar Vikas Gupta said, “The four-year option is not mandatory. Students can exit after three years with an honours degree. This means that students would not be burdened with additional living costs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/2013-rerun-unsure-of-fyup-in-delhi-university-say-teachers-101629917115999.html
26-08-2021||Other||How govt would have function without assured Covid treatment to staff?: Delhi HC||New Delhi: Hearing a plea challenging the Delhi government’s decision to link four hotels with two hospital exclusively for the Delhi government officials and their families, the Delhi high court on Wednesday questioned as to how the government machinery would have functioned, if the employees were not assured treatment during the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic.“The wheels of administration in the NCT of Delhi would have come to a grinding halt without this much assurance to the officials that they will receive treatment otherwise they would not have been able to discharge their duties without fear. They would not have been able to give attention and focus with which they were expected to discharge their duties,” the bench said.“We are not living in ivory towers. We were seeing what was happening in the city during the second wave on a daily basis. Thousands of people were looking at the state for some relief…In our view such officers clearly constitute a different class on account of their duties which they were required to perform during the peak of the pandemic. They were required to come to duties by stepping out of the comfort of homes and they had no option to remain inside,” the court added.The bench said during the lockdown, while the common citizenry were in their homes, it was the government officers who were out on the streets to manage the situation and if such officers/ officials were to fall sick and were not to receive treatment of COVID-19, not only they but the entire citizenry of Delhi would have suffered.The court said the submission of the counsel that the resources of the state remained unutilised due to the exclusive reservation given to the officials has no factual basis.The remarks come on the plea of Kaushal Kant Mishra, a doctor, who had challenged an April 27 notification of the city government reserving 240 rooms in four hotels linked with two hospitals for COVID-19 treatment of officials of various public authorities and their families.According to the 70 rooms in Hotel Ginger at Vivek Vihar here, 50 rooms in Hotel Park Plaza in Shahdara, and 50 rooms in Hotel Leela Ambience at CBD Ground in Karkardooma, linked to Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital and all the rooms in Hotel Golden Tulip at Hari Nagar, which is linked to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (DDU), are reserved for the treatment of officers/officials of Delhi government, autonomous bodies, corporations, local bodies and their families.Mishra’s counsel argued that creating such exclusive facilities for officers would violate fundamental rights including right to life and liberty of other citizens of Delhi who were seeking COVID-19 treatment but would be deprived of getting it as limited resources will be diverted for treating the officials.However, the Wednesday the court said that judges do not live in ivory towers and are aware of the condition of the city during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic.It disagreed with an argument that resources of the state remained unutilised due to the exclusive reservation of facilities for COVID-19 treatment of government officials and their families.The court said that the submission of petitioner’s counsel does not take into account the ground reality of the second wave of the pandemic.“There was such a shortage of facilities including oxygen, medicines, hospital beds, oxygenated beds, ICUs, doctors and paramedical staff that there was no question of any facilities remaining unutilised,” the court said, adding that when there was a massive dearth of medical infrastructure during the second wave of the pandemic, government officials were risking their lives on the streets to manage the situation.It said the state is obliged to provide medical facilities to all the citizens including those grinding wheels of the administration and when the pandemic was at its height, there was a greater need of governance since the fire of the pandemic was raging at its peak.The court listed the matter for further arguments on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/how-govt-would-have-function-without-assured-covid-treatment-to-staff-delhi-hc-101629917114802.html

Principals of various city colleges and officials of the health department were present at the meetingAn official spokesperson said, “The DC was informed that almost 100% college staff and nearly 50% of students enrolled in Government Degree Colleges in the district have been administered the Covid-19 vaccine. A process is on to cover the remaining students.”On Sunday, chief secretary Arun Kumar Mehta, after reviewing the Covid situation, had issued an order stating that the government shall consider phased reopening of educational institutions where 100% vaccination of staff and students has been achieved.Following this, the Srinagar DC had asked all principals to ensure that students enrolled in their respective colleges are vaccinated. “This will help protect the college staff as well as students from contracting the virus. Besides, it creates an atmosphere to start offline classes, and ultimately keep colleges open,” Asad said.The DC further called for holding seminars and counselling sessions regarding the importance of Covid-19 vaccination. “Students are being vaccinated as a priority group to facilitate the opening of higher education classes physically,” Asad said.Later, the DC held a separate meeting with senior officers of the district administration, CMO and zonal medical officers (ZMOs) and reviewed the pace of Covid-19 vaccination in the 18-44 age group, Covid containment measures and other aspects undertaken to effectively tackle the spread of the deadly virus.Asad asked all ZMOs to work towards covering the maximum population and also hold special drives during wee hours for the convenience of people who are not available during office hours.The ZMOs were further directed to increase the average rate of per day vaccinations in order to achieve the set targets.The DC asked all officials concerned to apply the learning from the past and prepare themselves to tackle the future challenge of a possible third wave. He also directed all officials concerned to keep a close check on social gatherings, including marriage functions, and take strict action against violators holding marriage parties without prior permission from the administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/100-staff-50-students-in-srinagar-colleges-vaccinated-101629917114360.html

He claimed that at the time of filing of nomination form Hans furnished false information in affidavit and he did not disclose the material facts in it.He alleged that the accused did not give the correct information regarding his educational qualifications, financial status of his wife, income of his dependents and regarding holding of office in National Safai Karamchari Commission.The complaint had alleged that the BJP functionary had stated his educational qualification as “MATRIC”, however, he further pursued the studies and passed “PREP” (equivalent to Class XI) from DAV College, Jalandhar.The court noted that according to a report submitted, he did not pass “PREP” from the college and so it was clear that he had given the correct information regarding his educational qualifications in his form. It said no document had been filed on record to show that Hans’s wife was in employment or doing any business.The judge also said that accused had not mentioned his sons as dependents during filing his nomination form and there was no requirement to mention the assets or income of such a child who was not dependent upon a candidate.“Except allegations, no material has been brought on record on behalf of prosecution to prove that both sons of the accused are dependent upon him,” it said.It noted that according to the report filed by the investigating officer, Hans had resigned from the post of vice-chairman of National Safai Karamchari Commission in April 2019 and as per prosecution, he had filed the nomination after his resignation.The court said the candidate was not required to mention the office from which he had resigned, and the remuneration which had been received by him in the past.The offence was punishable with an imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine, or with both.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-substance-against-allegations-of-wrong-info-in-poll-affidavit-by-mp-hans-raj-hans-court-101629916993731.html

26-08-2021||Noida||Mercury on rise in Noida, rains in two days||Citizens may have to brace themselves for some discomfort as the maximum temperature is likely to increase in Noida and the adjoining areas in the next two to three days with dry weather conditions likely to prevail in the region. However, weather forecasters said that the discomfort may be temporary as the city may receive some showers from August 28 onwards. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Gautam Budh Nagar remained relatively dry on Wednesday. However, the rainfall recording of 7mm that the district received between Tuesday and Wednesday morning helped retain some moisture and kept the mercury from rising on Wednesday, even as the temperature notched by two degrees in neighbouring Delhi. According to the IMD, the mercury may soar over next two days with the city likely to receive light rainfall from August 28 onwards.“Most parts of Uttar Pradesh have received heavy rainfall over the past 24 hours; parts of GB Nagar must have also received some showers. However, the region including Delhi-NCR, Haryana, Punjab and Rajashtan, are now seeing dry westerly winds and will see slight rise in mercury. A low pressure monsoon trough line that has shifted north of Delhi towards the Himalayan foothills will return around August 28, leading to light to moderate rainfall,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president (meteorology and climate change) of a private weather forecasting centre, Skymet.According to data available with the IMD, GB Nagar’s rainfall quota is 67% deficient of its average since June 1. So far, the district has received 135mm rain against the 404.2mm considered normal during monsoon.

The minimum settled at 27.4°C, a notch above the season’s average.Experts said the monsoon in Delhi usually has just two break spells for about 4-5 days each.“This is an uncommonly high number of dry spells,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of Skymet, a private forecaster.IMD scientists define weak monsoon conditions as those when the end of the monsoon trough shifts to the Himalayan foothills, even as eastern India receives ample rainfall.A complete or a typical break is when the entire Indo-Gangetic plains and central India experience dry spell at the same time.The monsoon first hit a dry spell between June 29 and July 12, even before it made its onset in the Capital. It eventually hit the city on July 13, over two weeks behind schedule, and the latest since 2002.However, just two intense spells covered the month’s rain deficit, with July ending with surplus rainfall.The monsoon then hit another dry spell, resulting in few showers for the first two weeks of August, with the month receiving less than half the rainfall it usually gets in that period. The monsoon revived on August 20, followed by the season’s heaviest spell of rain so far on August 21 (138.8mm), which was also the most rain in a single day of the month since 2007.Madhavan Nair Rajeevan, secretary of the Union ministry of earth sciences, also said such partial breaks occur every season, they have been more “prolonged” this year.“The warming of the Indian Ocean at a higher rate may be one of the factors. Another factor could be the Madden-Julian Oscillation, or MJO location is unfavourable and is inhibiting convective activity,” said Rajeevan.MJO location is the largest element in the intra-seasonal variability in the tropical atmosphere and strongly regulates features like low pressure systems over the north Indian Ocean. MJO is an eastward moving disturbance of clouds, rainfall, winds that affects weather activities (such as storm, rainfall) across the globe.Experts said the monsoon in northwest India has seen the weakening phase more frequently.“The break spell is not noticeable sometimes, as it lasts for just two or three days. One of the major reasons for the weak conditions is that both the frequency and intensity of the weather systems (low-pressure systems) formed in the Bay of Bengal this monsoon is low,” said Palawat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/monsoon-enters-third-break-little-rain-in-store-for-delhi-till-august-28-101629916696324.html

NAEC president Lalit Thukral said that the district had been declared the ‘City of Apparel’ under the UP government’s ‘One District, One Product’ scheme to promote local products.“Prominent garment and apparel houses have been allotted plots at the Apparel Park that will further strengthen the district’s presence in the industry and generate 500,000 jobs and NAEC will ensure that a majority of it goes to people from nearby villages and towns, and 70% of the workforce will be women,” said Thukral who is also the Convenor of Ready Made Garments, UP Export Promotion Council.“The Apparel Park was conceived in 2018. There will be a total of 116 plots spread over the 221.5 hectares, of which 91 have been earmarked for NAEC. Sity-eight plots have already been allotted to the NAEC members, while the remaining will be allotted by end of August,” said Arun Vir Singh, CEO, YEIDA.He added that the units which are engaged in manufacturing & making textiles, garments, apparels, as defined by Union ministry of textile are eligible for the plots.“Each application for the plot is interviewed and verified before getting allotted. Once the plots are allotted and possession is given, industries will start construction and the hub will be ready by 2023,” added Singh. The Apparel Park is expected to draw an investment of around ₹2,500 crore and earn ₹5,000 crore additional foreign exchange annually, say exporters.An Apparel Training and Design Center has been established in sector 24, Noida to provide skills to craftsmen engaged in garment factories. A similar Center will be set up at the Apparel Park by NAEC to train workforce and employ them in the garment industry, added Thukral.“Already around 3,000 apparel production units are in operation in GB Nagar and in these units approximately 10 lakh people are employed directly or indirectly. The district manufactures readymade garments worth Rs. 30,000 crores annually and of that, garments worth Rs.25,000 crores are exported and rest go to the domestic market,” informed Thukral.MLA Dhirendra Singh added, “As soon as people enter Jewar from the toll plaza, they will be welcomed with the signage that has been inaugurated today. The apparel hub will generate employment for the villagers of which 70% will be women”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/city-of-apparel-signage-put-up-near-jewar-toll-plaza-101629916695190.html

26-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: GMCH ramps up infra to tackle Covid surge||Taking no chances amid a possible third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, has started ramping up its health infrastructure.From just 55 ventilators available during the first and second wave, the number has gone up to 149. The daily capacity for conducting RT-PCR tests has also been bumped up from 450 to 1,200. “The hospital recently received ventilators from the central government and some have been donated by non-governmental organisations,” said Dr Jasbinder Kaur, director-principal, GMCH. While 14 of the 149 ventilators have been kept at the paediatric intensive care unit (for children below 10), a dozen of them are reserved for the neonatal care facility, she said.“The other problem we faced during the infection surge was limited RT-PCR testing capacity in Chandigarh. It has been ramped up to 1,250 tests a day. If the situation arises, we will extend the capacity to 1,500 tests per day,” said Dr Kaur.The Chandigarh health department is also setting up a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generation plant at GMCH with a capacity to generate 1,000 liters of medical oxygen per minute. Though health experts believe the third wave will not be as aggressive as the second wave amid the ongoing vaccination drive, other government hospitals in Chandigarh are also ramping up their facilities to tackle another surge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-gmch-ramps-up-infra-to-tackle-covid-surge-101629916574196.html

The girl, identified as Jyotsna Sharma, was a Class 7 student studying at a private school. Her father is a manager with an electronic appliances company in Noida, said police. Sub-inspector Narpal Singh, police post in-charge of Govindpuram, said, “The girl’s puppy got stuck in the net installed in the balcony and she was probably trying to prevent the dog from falling down. It seems she was so focussed on saving the dog that she lost balance and slipped. The puppy too slipped from the balcony and died.”  Soon after the incident, locals gathered at the spot rushed the girl to a private hospital in Kavi Nagar, where she was declared brought dead. Police said the girl’s mother was at home and rushed to check on her daughter when she heard some noise. The girl’s father was at work and rushed home on knowing about the incident. Singh said he approached the family on Wednesday afternoon. “The girl’s parents did not opt for a post-mortem, nor did they file any complaint. The girl was the only child of her parents and was very fond of the pet,” said the sub-inspector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-girl-falls-to-death-while-trying-to-save-puppy-101629916516106.html

Interacting with some progressive farmers at his residence here, he announced that the government would withdraw cases against farmers and revoke fines imposed on them for burning crop residue in the fields. He also said that having cleared ₹1.42 lakh crore cane arrears pending since 2010, his government would now enhance the state support price of cane after consulting all the stakeholders in this regard. The crushing of cane in sugar mills would start from October 20 in the western region, from October 25 in the central region and in the first week of November in the eastern region, added the CM. The CM further said that famers’ power connections would not be snapped for dues and the government would also bring a one-time settlement scheme (OTS) to waive interest on the power dues. He said the government was committed to the welfare of farmers and bringing about qualitative change in their lives by enhancing their income with the help of various schemes launched by the central and state governments. The government purchased a record 56 lakh MT of wheat from farmers on the minimum support price despite the pandemic whereas wheat purchase was as low as six lakh MT in 2016-17, said Yogi Adityanath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/govt-to-withdraw-cases-against-farmers-booked-for-stubble-burning-up-cm-101629916515656.html

26-08-2021||Noida||Man arrested for killing friend over monetary dispute||Greater Noida: A 24-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly killing his friend over a ₹2 lakh loan in Surajpur on Saturday night. Police identified the suspect and victim by single names as Deepu, a native of Hapur who lived in Surajpur, and 32-year-old Pawan who ran a medical store in the neighbourhood, respectively. Deputy commissioner of police (Noida central) Harish Chander said Pawan’s body was found with bullet wounds in a flat on Saturday night. Pawan’s brother Vinod filed a complaint with the Surajpur police informing them that Pawan was partying with three persons -- Monu Bhati, Deepu, and Kuldeep -- in the flat on the night. “When Vinod could not reach his brother over phone, he visited the flat and found him dead,” said Chander.Based on the complaint, a case was registered against the three and another person under sections 302 (murder) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) on Sunday. Chander said on Wednesday the police received a tip about Deepu’s movement near Tilapta roundabout in Greater Noida. “A police team arrested him from there,” he said. Surajpur police station house officer Ajay Kumar said they questioned Deepu who told them about what happened that night. “Monu’s brother Rishi borrowed nearly ₹2 lakh from Pawan some time back but had not repaid it. Monu and Pawan quarrelled over it,” he said. Deepu and Kuldeep allegedly too got involved in the fight. “Monu took out a countrymade gun and shot him dead. The three suspects then fled the spot.” Monu and Kuldeep are absconding, he added. A countrymade gun allegedly used in the murder was recovered from the crime spot. Kumar said they are investigating the Rishi’s role in the case. Deepu was produced in court and sent to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-arrested-for-killing-friend-over-monetary-dispute-101629916514179.html

He said this while addressing the Himachal Pradesh Administrative Service (HPAS) trainees at Himachal Pradesh Institute of Public Administration (HIPA). Earlier, he inaugurated the new building of HIPA named ‘Kalptaru’ and also launched e-Office and Wall-E of the institute. He said that government administrative services officers must work with dedication and commitment so that they can meet the expectations of the common man and contribute towards the development of the state. The CM further said masses have built a perception regarding politicians as well as government servants. “Thus, it is vital that the officers work with greater zeal to meet the expectations of the general public,” he said. He said the officers must ensure that the benefits of policies and programmes initiated by the state government reach the person living at the lowest ebb. Thakur said the training module for officers entering the services must focus on their efficiency and sensitivity through the basic knowledge, skills and positive changes required in behaviour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/young-officers-must-come-up-with-innovative-ideas-jai-ram-101629916455350.html
26-08-2021||Delhi||Stand-alone AIIMS trauma centre to reopen for trauma cases this weekend||The stand-alone trauma centre of the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) will reopen this weekend for trauma patients, 15 months after it was converted to a dedicated coronavirus disease (Covid-19) treatment facility. The 364-bed centre will take in both Covid-19 and trauma patients, with separate wards, operation theatres, and lifts for both. This comes after the resident doctors’ association of the hospital wrote to the administration stating that there was hardly any Covid-19 patient at the centre with a dip in cases in the city, while a significant number of trauma patients were unable to get beds. Only 25 to 35 Covid-19 patients were admitted at any given time at the centre over the past one month, according to resident doctors. The emergency trauma cases, however, will continue to be treated in the old out-patient department block that was converted to the trauma emergency in the main hospital during the pandemic. Only “relatively stable” patients will be admitted to the wards in the stand-alone centre. “Both Covid and non-Covid services will be run from trauma centre. The trauma emergency for the time being will be run from the main hospital and all emergency operations will be done in the main hospital. There will be no direct admissions at JNNATC (Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Centre),” said a communication from AIIMS trauma chief Dr Rajesh Malhotra. The decision was taken after a meeting with the AIIMS director on Tuesday. Three floors of the eight storey building, including the ground floor, and three of seven operation theatres will be utilised for treatment of trauma patients, the communication further said. The resident doctors, however, said these facilities may not be enough as there was a dip of less than 30% in trauma cases even during the pandemic and the lockdowns and restrictions since last year. “Initially, it was thought that the number of trauma cases will go down when people do not step out due to Covid-19, but over the last two waves, we have seen that it is just the pattern that changes. We start seeing more cases of children falling off roofs or traumas sustained at home due to rising frustrations,” said a representative of the resident doctors association, not wishing to be named. “The key for managing any trauma case is the emergency, operation theatre, and the ICU, all three of which continue to be in the main AIIMS. Only stable patients will be in the trauma centre; what this means is that if there is another surge they will be moved out. “The number of trauma cases did not really go down – there was only a 30% reduction through the year even though there was a sharp dip during the complete lockdown – but the number of beds and other facilities have been reduced significantly,” the doctor said. There were 264 beds, including 38 ICU beds, available to trauma patients at the stand-alone centre, whereas only 95 beds, including 18 ICU beds, were available at the main AIIMS for trauma cases. “We have had to transfer out patients, treat patients on stretchers. Yet the building continues to be utilised for Covid-19 service instead of the new burns treatment building, ophthalmic centre, and dental centre that do not see too many cases when Covid-19 increases,” the doctor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/standalone-aiims-trauma-centre-to-reopen-for-trauma-cases-this-weekend-101629916455870.html
26-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi high court awards ₹20 lakh to man rendered 100% disabled after falling from power pole||The Delhi high court on Wednesday granted ₹20 lakh as compensation to a 28-year-old man, who was rendered fully disabled after falling off an electricity pole while fixing a fault in Bijwasan area in 2014. The court said even though “he is living, he is barely alive” and directed BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL) and the contractor, Bryn Construction Company, to pay the compensation within three weeks of Wednesday’s judgment.On April 25, 2014, Bharat, then 21 years, while working as an electrician with Bryn, was tasked with rectifying a fault in an electricity pole that was causing fluctuations in the supply to a farmhouse in Bijwasan. He fell while performing the task as the pole he was on snapped.Bharat’s father Kehar Singh approached the high court seeking proper equipment and medicines for his son, along with financial assistance, so that his family do not have to starve to provide Bharat with the emergency medicines he needs.Justice Anup J Bhambani directed BRPL and contractor Bryn to pay the compensation and said the accident would not have taken place but for their negligence in taking reasonable precautions. “Whether or not Bharat was provided any safety gear is in any case irrelevant, since that would not absolve Bryn and/or BRPL of their obligation to compensate Bharat,” it further said.“It is also noticed that though there are vague, passing averments that compensation has already been paid to Bharat and medical aid was also provided to him, the counter affidavits filed do not give any particulars of proof of payment, except an undated declaration/statement allegedly signed by Bharat accepting payment of a small sum of compensation in full-and-final settlement from Bryn and absolving them of any further liability,” Bhambani said in a 78-page judgment.Both BRPL and Bryn denied any responsibility for the accident and disclaimed any liability, contending that it is the responsibility of the other respondent to do so.The judge also said that the declaration of accepting small sum as compensation, even though signed by Bharat, did not deserve credence or value “since it smacks of being a document procured by Bryn precisely for the purpose of absolving itself of any further claim or liability”.The single judge also directed that a shop be opened in Bharat’s native village Daulat Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, from the compensation money which is to be given within four weeks from Wednesday. He said that the store be run by Bharat’s father or by any other responsible member of his immediate family with the stipulation that Bharat is engaged in running of the store to the extent his health and physical state permits.It clarified that all earnings from the store will be used and applied for Bharat’s medical and living expenses and for his welfare and well-being.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-high-court-awards-20-lakh-to-man-rendered-100-disabled-after-falling-from-power-pole-101629916453614.html

We have studied the film policy of several states and ours will be the most progressive (policy). It will give a boost to the entertainment sector,” said Kejriwal on the sidelines of an event on Wednesday. He further said, “The Covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected the livelihood of a large number of people associated with the entertainment industry.”Earlier this month, Kejriwal chaired a review meeting to study the progress in drafting the policy.A senior government official, on condition of anonymity, said the government is planning to set up a single-window clearance mechanism for issuing shooting permits, apart from developing locations and inventory of equipment and offering a host of incentives to filmmakers.In Delhi, the civic agencies have policies which have tariffs for the shooting of films in public spaces under its jurisdiction but there is no single specific policy with a larger vision and objectives. Neighbouring states such as Uttar Pradesh and Haryana drafted film policies of their own in 2015 and 2018, respectively. Earlier this month, the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir also notified its film policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-film-policy-to-get-cabinet-nod-soon-says-kejriwal-101629916454199.html
26-08-2021||Delhi||Sisodia: Centre has said no to panel probing deaths related to oxygen shortage||Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday said Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya has written to the Delhi government that it does not need to form a separate committee for probing oxygen related deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic, citing a separate committee which is already working on it.“The central government’s fraud on deaths due to lack of oxygen has come out in the open. Union health minister is presenting false arguments to avoid investigation. He has written to us saying Delhi government does not need to set up a committee to probe deaths caused by shortage of oxygen because a high-level committee, constituted under the Supreme Court’s direction, is already working on the matter across states,” said Sisodia in a video press briefing.Sisodia said, “By saying that there is no need for a committee to investigate deaths due to oxygen shortage as the task force and sub-group constituted by the Supreme Court is investigating it, the Union health minister is lying shamelessly. Neither the task force set up by the Supreme Court, nor the sub-group formed in the states for oxygen audit is mandated to investigate the deaths due to lack of oxygen, the task force and the sub-group are mandated with configuring allocation of oxygen supply and medicines.”The Union health ministry did not comment on the matter.Sisodia on August 20 said lieutenant governor (LG) Anil Baijal has once again rejected the Delhi government’s request for approval to set up an expert committee to investigate instances of deaths caused by shortage of oxygen in Delhi during the last wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in April even as he accused the central government of “mismanagement”.On May 4, the Delhi government told the Delhi High Court that an expert committee could not ascertain whether 21 deaths at Jaipur Golden Hospital had happened because of oxygen shortage. Later, health minister Satyendar Jain said that it was a “preliminary report”.In June, the Delhi government proposed another expert committee to ascertain number of deaths caused by oxygen shortage in the Capital during the last wave of the pandemic but Baijal did not approve it.On July 20, the central government told the Parliament that states recorded no deaths caused by oxygen shortage during the Covid-19 pandemic. With that, the AAP government in Delhi, revived its demand for setting up its own expert committee on the matter.On August 16, Sisodia sent a file to Baijal’s office for the second time seeking approval for setting up the expert panel and sought Union home minister Amit Shah’s intervention in the matter. But, LG rejected the demand again.At its peak, Delhi recorded around 28,300 cases in a day and a positivity rate exceeding 36% on April 20 and 22 respectively. Around that time, at least 31 people are believed to have died because of oxygen shortage in two separate incidents in two separate hospitals – Jaipur Golden and Batra hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sisodia-centre-has-said-no-to-panel-probing-deaths-related-to-oxygen-shortage-101629916395348.html

Another accomplice died during trial.It was on July 13, 2014, when the men had struck at Rajat Jewellers in Swastik Vihar, Mansa Devi Complex, Sector 5, and orchestrated the robbery at gunpoint in broad daylight . The shop owner, Ashi Khanna, had told police that a youth wearing a helmet and gloves was the first to enter the shop and point a pistol at his forehead. As Khanna resisted, the youth hit him on his head. Thereafter, more youths with masked faces entered the shop wielding pistols and sharp-edged weapons. They hit the owner and workers, threw chilli powder in their eyes and tied their hands and face with clothes before fleeing with the jewellery, stated the FIR.They even took Khanna’s car keys from the counter. The car was later recovered from Zirakpur. A case was registered the same day.It was with the help of their counterparts in Punjab that the local police managed to get hold of the robbers.

26-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s 7th sero survey from next week, will also account for vaccination status||The seventh round of sero-surveillance to estimate the population level exposure to the SARS-CoV- virus that causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19) will begin in the capital next week state government officials familiar with the matter said.“The survey will begin in another week or even sooner; the files for approval have already been sent to the minister’s office. The survey was initially supposed to happen between August 1 and 10 but couldn’t be done,” said a senior official from the health department who asked not to be named.Sero-surveillance surveys are blood tests that check for antibodies to the virus. They are a good measure of the exposure of a population to the virus. They are also a proxy for the level of broad immunity that exists in the population, although the best immunity is that achieved through vaccination.The last round of the survey conducted in Delhi in April, the sixth such, had to be stopped midway due to rising cases but 13,000 of the planned 28,000 samples that had already been collected returned a reading of nearly 56%, which means 56 out of every 100 residents of the Union territory were exposed to the virus. The previous five surveys returned readings of 56.13%, 25.5%, 25.1%, 29.1%, and 22.6% respectively.A senior official from Shahadara district said, “Our teams are ready; the survey is likely to begin at a short notice.” An east district official confirmed, “There were a couple of meeting at the beginning of the month, but the survey did not start. However, our teams are already prepared and we can start collecting samples at a moment’s notice.”There are likely to be several new parameters included in the survey, according to researchers at the Maulana Azad Medical College who are leading the effort. With a significant proportion of the population having been vaccinated, details of vaccination will be included, which was to be done even during the April survey that was truncated because of the sudden increase in cases.Till Tuesday evening, 3.57 million people in Delhi were fully vaccinated and another 5.47 million partly vaccinated. The number of people eligible for vaccinations in Delhi is 15 million, which means at least 60% of them have thus far received at least one dose of the vaccine.Delhi’s high sero-surveillance reading in the last round is understandable; the city was ravaged in April and May by the second wave of the coronavirus disease pandemic with cases rising to 28,395 on April 20 at the peak. The Union territory has seen over 1.43 million cases and 25,080 deaths so far according to the HT dashboard.The sample collection will be carried out as per the previous methodology to ensure that the surveys are comparable, according to the researchers at Maulana Azad college.“(ICMR) has advised states to conduct the sero-prevalence studies in their own States/UTs in consultation with ICMR, so that such studies follow a standardized protocol,” the Union government told states in July after releasing the findings of the fourth round of national sero-surveillance, in which Delhi was not represented.A WHO study done by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences found the population level sero-prevalence of 67%, with samples being collected between March and May. The prevalence is likely to be higher as the antibodies are detected 10 to 14 days after the infection and the peak infections happened in April-end and May-beginning in Delhi.Another study of around 1,000 people across CSIR campuses in Delhi found the sero-prevalence to be 87%, with samples being collected between May end and early-July.According to INSACOG (Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics), many of these people were infected with the delta variant of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-seventh-sero-survey-from-next-week-will-also-account-for-vaccination-status-101629916335821.html
26-08-2021||Delhi||Protest is not conspiracy, Saifi’s lawyer tells court||Seeking bail in the larger conspiracy case related to the north-east Delhi riots, rights activist Khalid Saifi on Wednesday told a Delhi court that he has every right to protest and does not owe an explanation to anyone in the country for participating in the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment ) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).Saifi, along with several others, has been booked under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for allegedly conspiring to orchestrate the February 2020 riots, which left 53 people dead and over 700 injured.Senior advocate Rebecca John, appearing for Saifi, a member of “United Against Hate”, told additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat that “merely protesting” is not indicative that he was a part of a conspiracy.“If I and others like me feel that CAA and NRC are unjust, I have every right to protest. This is not indicative of any conspiracy,” John said.“Saifi protested against the CAA and NRC as did I and many others in this room. It does not make any one of us culpable. It is a vibrant democracy. Was there an incitement to violence?,” she contended.John said the prosecution needs to be reminded about the constitutional right to protest.The matter would be next heard on September 9.According to his counsel, Saifi was arraigned as an accused in three cases related to the riots, of which he has been granted bail in two.In November 2020, the district court, while granting Saifi bail in one of the riot cases, said charge-sheeting him over insignificant material was a total “non-application of mind” by the Delhi Police.Besides Saifi, former Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student leader Umar Khalid, and JNU students Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, Jamia coordination committee members Safoora Zargar, former Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor Tahir Hussain and several others have also been booked in the larger conspiracy case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/its-my-right-to-protest-do-not-owe-explanation-to-anyone-saifi-tells-court-during-bail-hearing-in-delhi-riots-case-101629916334202.html
26-08-2021||Delhi||Mahasweta Devi, two Dalit authors axed from DU’s eng syllabus, teachers dissent||Several Delhi University teachers on Tuesday expressed concerns over the removal of texts by renowned author Mahasweta Devi and two Dalit authors from the undergraduate English syllabus without consulting the committee of courses and termed it “maximum vandalism” and overreach by the oversight committee.The oversight committee is tasked with looking at problems with reference to exams, course changes, and other department requirements. The committee is appointed by the executive council, the highest decision-making body of the university.In a dissent note submitted by 15 academic council (AC) members on Tuesday, teachers said the oversight committee which approved such changes did not have the powers to do so. The AC members said the same was the case with history, political science, and sociology departments as well.“In a core paper titled “Women’s Writing” in semester 5, the oversight committee has committed the maximum vandalism. It first decided to remove two Dalit scholars, namely Bama and Sukartharini, who were replaced by upper caste writer Ramabai,” the dissent note said.“The committee as an afterthought suddenly asked the English department to delete the celebrated short story of Mahasweta Devi, “Draupadi” – a story about a tribal woman – without supplying any academic logic. This is notwithstanding the fact that “Draupadi” has been taught by the University of Delhi since 1999 owing to its seminal academic value and also figures in the UGC model syllabus for 2019 for BA (H) English,” the note further said.“These changes were introduced recently and there is absolutely no academic rationale for them. Oversight committee members are from sciences background. Department heads are only called as special invitees, so they cannot vote against the changes being introduced by committee members. Even the department heads were not given an explanation on why these texts were removed,” said AC member Mithuraj Dhusiya, who teaches English at Hansraj College and is one of the signatories to the dissent note.Incidentally, the learning outcomes based curriculum framework (LOCF) syllabus for the four subjects of history, political science, sociology and English had run into a controversy in 2019 as well over certain omissions.Also Read | 2013 rerun: Unsure of FYUP in Delhi University, say teachersOn Tuesday, the dissenting AC members also said the committee refused to accept any short story by Devi despite her iconic literary stature. Devi, a Bengali author and tribal and women rights activist, had received several awards for her seminal work, including the Sahitya Akademi award, the Jnanpith Award, and was also conferred with a Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian award in India. She died in Kolkata in 2016.Apart from introducing short stories such as “Sultana’s Dream” by Begum Rokeya without consultation with the course committee and against the recommendations of the department, the committee also removed “a feminist reading of Ramayana”, the AC members wrote, while referring to Chandrabati’s Ramayana.The committee also “arbitrarily deleted sections” from the paper titled “Interrogating Queerness”, the teachers said.“It is unfortunate that the oversight committee has always shown a prejudice against the representation of Dalits, tribals, women, and sexual minorities as evident in its concerted efforts to remove all such voices from the syllabus,” the academics wrote, adding that the committee “does not have any member from the Dalit or the tribal community who can possibly bring in some sensitivity to the issue”.Rudrashish Chakraborty, who teaches English at Kirori Mal College, said, "The Oversight Committee is guilty of not only undermining the laid down academic processes of the University, they have also abdicated their responsibility towards the students by delaying the notification of the syllabus in every semester. It is unbecoming of a University having stature like DU to notify the syllabus 5 weeks after the commencement of the semester."Oversight committee chairperson Maharaj K Pandit responded, “We, as senior academics of the university, should not get into these kind of conversations. We have not changed the syllabus of any subject. Only in English, one author has been taught for eons, and so some of the committee members were of a mind that “shouldn’t we look at other authors?” I do not even know whether the other authors are Dalit or not. The committee had conflicting opinions over the story [Draupadi] so we decided to drop it with the consent of head of the department, who selected an alternative story in its place from a suggested list.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mahasweta-devi-two-dalit-authors-axed-from-du-s-ug-english-syllabus-teachers-dissent-101629916333678.html
26-08-2021||Delhi||Prime suspect in Jantar Mantar hate sloganeering case arrested, say Delhi Police||The Delhi police on Wednesday arrested Uttam Malik, an alleged prime suspect in the August 8 anti-Muslim sloganeering case at Jantar Mantar.Senior Delhi police officers, who asked not be named, said Malik, a resident of Ghaziabad claimed that he is a follower of Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati -- the head priest of a temple in Dasna, Ghaziabad. Saraswati was earlier named in an FIR for hate speech against Prophet Muhammad at the Press Club of India on April 1.When contacted, Saraswati, said, “ I won’t deny that he is my follower. We will fight his case legally. It is his constitutional right to defend himself. Delhi police are framing innocent persons in the case.”The police arrested seven persons in the case registered after videos of an August 8 rally at Jantar Mantar went viral on social media where participants allegedly raised anti-Muslim slogans. Those arrested include Ashwini Upadhyay, former spokesperson of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Delhi unit. Upadhyay was released on bail on August 11, a day after his arrest. The rally was organised by ‘Bharat Jodo Andolan’ against colonial-era laws.Several videos from Jantar Mantar purportedly show Malik, whose real name is Uttam Upadhyay, shouting hate slogans. HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the video.In the ongoing investigation in the case, police are still on the lookout for Pinky Chaudhary. chief of the Hindu Raksha Dal -- a right wing group which had claimed responsibility for the violence on JNU campus in January 2020. Chaudhary’s anticipatory bail plea was rejected by a Delhi court on August 21.“Our investigation has revealed that the August 8 rally at Jantar Mantar was planned months in advance. Messages were circulated among different groups on WhatsApp, and people from different groups participated in the rally. The people we have arrested so far are connected to each other. The organisers of the event sent invitations under the banner of Bharat Jodo Andolan. People were asked to join a group called Save India Foundation through a WhatsApp number that was mentioned on the invitation for the August 8 event. One of the arrested accused, Preet Singh is the convener of the Save India Foundation,” said a police officer.Police said five others arrested accused --- Deepak Kumar, Vinod Sharma, Deepak Yadav, Vinit Bajpai and Sushil Tiwari -- are all associated with different right-wing organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prime-suspect-in-jantar-mantar-hate-sloganeering-case-arrested-say-delhi-police-101629916274676.html
26-08-2021||Delhi||Want to open schools, but can’t risk kids’ health: Delhi CM Kejriwal||A committee formed by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) to come up with a strategy to reopen schools, colleges and education institutions in the Capital filed its report on Wednesday, recommending the reopening of schools in a phased manner from September, starting with higher classes, two senior officials aware of the matter said.It was unclear if the recommendation will be accepted at this point in time. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday pointed to the “mixed experiences” other states have had with school openings and said that while his government is in favour of this in principle, it cannot afford to risk the health of children.“The experience seen in other states is mixed. We are closely monitoring the situation. We are in favour of re-opening of schools at the earliest, but we cannot take risks with the health of children,” Kejriwal said on the sidelines of an event in south Delhi’s Vasant Vihar on Wednesday evening.Himachal Pradesh reopened schools for classes 10 to 12 on August 2, but the administration reversed the move less than 10 days later after a few dozen students were diagnosed as Covid-19 patients and total daily cases in the state saw a spike.Other than this, schools across Uttar Pradesh resumed classroom teaching for classes 6 to 8, and Karnataka for classes 9-12 this week. Punjab went ahead and opened schools for all classes on August 2.The Haryana government, which was the first to reopen schools for classes 9-12 on July 16, on Wednesday said it was expanding the move to allow students of classes 4 and 5 from September 1.When asked about the committee’s report, Kejriwal said: “Whenever we take a decision, we shall inform the public about it without delay.”One of the two DDMA officials cited in the first instance said that the chief minister and the Lieutenant Governor will now go through the report and will likely take a call on the matter only after the next DDMA meeting, the date for which is yet to be decided. DDMA is chaired by L-G Baijal. CM Kejriwal is its vice chairperson.“The committee has also said that willing parents should have the option of sending their child to school and others can opt for online classes,” a senior DDMA official said.“The panel suggested that schools for senior classes can begin from the first week of September,” the official said.Meanwhile, schools said they were waiting for detailed guidelines on the matter.Malini Narayanan, the chairperson of the National Progressive Schools’ Conference which has 122 Delhi schools under it, said, “We are awaiting detailed guidelines on the matter because there is still little clarity over what “staggered” means. We are not looking at every child coming to school every day. We will look for a three-day week teaching for a certain number of hours in school and continue classes in blended mode for now.”Higher educational institutes said they will be focussing on ensuring that students from Science courses requiring lab work return to the university in a staggered manner once the government gives the green signal to reopen.Delhi University registar Vikas Gupta said, “We would first like to open for science students due to the practicals and then leave to the wisdom of colleges on how they plan the theory and practical lessons. The number of students in science courses in most colleges is lesser than in arts and commerce, so social distancing can be followed. Our staff are present on college premises and even non-science students who need help can come to colleges if the college administration allows them to do so.”Currently, students of classes 10, 11 and 12 can visit schools for matters related to admissions and their preparation for the board exams.Physical classes at Delhi schools have been suspended since March last year in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic. Higher classes reopened for a brief period between January and March this year were suspended again during the fourth wave of the pandemic in Delhi which coincided with the country’s bruising second wave.Some experts are of the view that children need to be vaccinated before schools can reopen. Others are of the opinion that if enough adults are vaccinated, chances of infections among children are low. But with only 17.8% of Delhi’s eligible population being fully vaccinated till Wednesday night, the Capital is still some distance away from reaching that position.The Union government approved a vaccine for children last week, although it wasn’t immediately clear whether it would be exclusively reserved for children, like some experts have suggested, or just become one more vaccine in the country’s current vaccine programme.India’s drug regulator on Friday approved Zydus Cadila’s three-dose Covid-19 DNA vaccine for emergency use in adults and children aged 12 years and above, making it the sixth vaccine authorised for use in the country, and the first for children. The company said it plans to manufacture 100 million to 120 million doses of ZyCoV-D annually and has started to stockpile the vaccine. There are two vaccine candidates that have been tested among children in India: Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Zydus Cadila’s ZyCov-D. The first is yet to be approved for children.Senior Delhi government officials said the Capital will soon draft a plan to vaccinate children against Covid-19 and send it for the central government’s approval. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi has been demanding vaccination of children against Covid-19 at the earliest.The second DDMA official cited above said that the panel has also suggested a phased reopening of colleges, but did not share specific details.The committee, formed on August 6, has been entrusted with chalking out a detailed plan, comprising standard operating procedures (SOPs); assessment of the ability of schools to implement such SOPs; plan for vaccination of teachers and staff; and address concerns of parents of the students.Dr Jacob John, former head of the clinical virology department at Christian Medical College in Tamil Nadu’s Vellore, said: “It is important to note that children are yet to be vaccinated against Covid-19. So, the authorities have to plan each step meticulously. Reopening of schools and education institutes should be done in a phased manner. Delhi can consider opening senior classes in a few schools in each district and observe trends for a period – say two weeks. They should take further calls based on the observations in each phase. They also must ensure that the entire staff – teachers to administrative staff and bus drivers – are fully vaccinated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ddmapanel-recommends-reopening-schools-in-delhi-in-phases-101629916274137.html
26-08-2021||Delhi||AAP says BJP owes MCD money for using hoardings||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of not paying the city’s municipal corporations for using their hoardings and billboards.“The BJP looted the MCDs [municipal corporations of Delho] by putting up advertisements worth crores on MCDs paid hoarding sites without paying a penny. The BJP is not paying the dues it should have for putting up all the advertisements. Contractors who put up advertisements are enduring heavy losses, the same has been stated MCD’s standing committee,” said AAP spokesperson and Greater Kailash MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj.He added, “The BJP-ruled MCD has now come up with a proposal to waive off the license fees so they can compensate for the losses they have inflicted upon the contractors. The MCDs should have received crores of rupees as revenue through advertisements, but the BJP used that money to fill their own pockets.”While the AAP is in charge of the Delhi government, the BJP rules the three municipal corporations.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “Instead of misleading people on issues that do not affect their everyday lives, the AAP should answer why the Delhi government has not released the funds which they owe to the three MCDs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-says-bjp-owes-mcd-money-for-using-hoardings-101629916214174.html
26-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi minister directs speedy disbursal of Covid-19 financial aid||Delhi’s social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam on Wednesday issued directions to officials to ensure that claims for financial assistance with regard to Covid-19 deaths are cleared on priority and the process of disbursement expedited, the government informed in a media statement.“Financial aid should reach beneficiaries as soon as possible and the process should not put an additional burden on grieving families. We will conduct on-ground surveys and there should be minimal rejection rate. Help needs to reach all grieving families,” Gautam said in the statement, issued after a review meeting.It further said, “A total of 3,103 applications for monthly pension have been received so far by the department under the scheme of which 665 have been approved. A total of 4,881 applications for a one-time ex gratia have been received by the department, of which 686 have been approved. The minister ordered the department and the magistrates to speed up the process of disbursement of financial aid.”Delhi has so far recorded more than 25,000 deaths due to Covid-19 – more than half of which were recorded in the second wave of the pandemic in April-May.On June 23, the government notified a scheme of a one-time financial assistance of ₹50,000 to each family with a Covid-19 death and a monthly assistance of ₹2,500 for families that lost their sole breadwinner and children orphaned by Covid-19.In July, the government formed teams to visit residences of people who died of Covid-19 and help them with the application process which, senior officials said, helped immensely in terms of increasing the number of applications received so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-minister-directs-speedy-disbursal-of-covid-19-financial-aid-101629916213583.html
26-08-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh says credit deposit ratio up: Imbalance among districts, regions persists||Amid the Uttar Pradesh government’s claims of a significant jump in the credit deposit (CD) ratio, an indicator of growing economic activity, a huge imbalance persists among different districts and regions of Uttar Pradesh.A State Level Banker’s Committee (SLBC) review indicates the state’s CD ratio went up from 46% in March 2017 to about 52% in June 2021 with the deposits increasing to ₹ 12,80,745.00 crore and advances to ₹ 6,61,811.00 crore.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who presided over a meeting of the State Level Banker’s Committee (SLBC) here on August 11, 2021, said the CD ratio witnessed a 6% jump. He said 43,000 new banking outlets were set up in the past four years and mega credit camps were being organised online, adding that such steps resulted in the increase in the state’s CD ratio.An additional increase has been claimed on the basis of the SLBC’s revised data in view of the state government’s mega loan distribution drives in recent months, officials said.The SLBC, constituted in April 1977 as an apex inter-institutional forum to create adequate coordination machinery for development of states, meets regularly and comprises representatives of commercial banks, including small finance banks, wholly owned subsidiaries (WOS) of foreign banks, RRBs (regional rural banks) , payments banks, state cooperative banks, NABARD, heads of government departments and Reserve Bank of India (RBI).A district-wise breakup indicates that nine of the nearly 30 districts of eastern UP have a CD ratio of less than 40%. Four of them have a CD ratio of less than 30%.In Bundelkhand, five of the seven districts have a 50%- plus CD ratio while the remaining two districts are in the 40% plus range. No district in central and west UP, however, falls in the less than 40% CD ratio category and most of the districts there are in the range of 50%-plus CD ratio.“Yes, most of the districts in west UP have a better CD ratio. Although only nine districts in east UP have a CD ratio of less than 40%, the situation in all the west UP districts remains much better,” said a senior officer.“An increase in the CD ratio is a sign that Uttar Pradesh’s economy is progressing towards higher investment and growth. A rising CD ratio is also indicative of the fact that UP’s improved ranking in the ease of doing business (2nd rank) is translating into increased investment activities. An increased flow of credit to agriculture, industry and trade will also spur entrepreneurship and lead to creation of more jobs. Since Uttar Pradesh is a big state, there is a high disparity in the CD ratio among districts. The state government needs to closely monitor the credit flow in such districts,” said professor Yashvir Tyagi, former head of department of economics, Lucknow University.“At the all India level, the CD ratio is 70% and above and, therefore, the state has a long way to go to reach close to the national average,” said Tyagi.About the impact of the government’s support schemes, Tyagi said, “Although the Covid-19 pandemic led to contraction in economic activities in the state, the Yogi government’s proactive approach in facilitating loans to the MSMEs, street vendors, farmers and labourers has helped in maintaining the CD ratio at a higher level.”“An increase in the CD ratio is a good development. The state government has ensured large amount of loans to MSMEs and small vendors amid Covid-19 pandemic. East UP has remained a neglected region and the state government should come out with special programmes to remove the disparities in neglected districts,” said AK Singh, former director of Giri Institute of Development Studies, Lucknow.UP’s former chief secretary Alok Ranjan said the CD ratio was in important indication towards where the state’s savings were being spent. “As chief secretary, we also made consistent efforts to increase the CD ratio. Some states like Tamil Nadu have more than 100% CD ratio. Our savings go to states like Maharashtra and there is a need to increase UP’s CD ratio further,” said Ranjan.Director general, institutional finance, Shiv Singh Yadav said, “We will ensure an improvement in the districts having a CD ratio of 40% or less. We have organised online mega credit camps and an amount of ₹ 9000 crore has been disbursed in the past few months. We are going to hold more mega credit camps in mission mode to ensure the flow of credit. Various credit camps will be organised at the district level next month and block levels thereafter. A target of 60% CD ratio has been set and we will achieve it soon.

26-08-2021||Mumbai||Species of jumping spider spotted for first time in India||Researchers from the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (SACON), Tamil Nadu, Christ College, Kerala, and the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, have recently documented the first-ever sighting of a spider species — identified as Irura mandarina — in India. The researchers made this discovery while on a routine arachnological excursion in the Western Ghats, in Sindhudurg district’s Kudal Taluka.“Previously this species was known only from two sites in Vietnam, and one site in southern China,” the researchers note in their paper, published this month in international peer-reviewed arachnology journal Peckhamia. The Irura mandarina belongs to a larger family of ‘jumping spiders’ called ‘salticidae’. As per existing literature, this family of spiders contains 600 different genera and over 6,000 described species, several of which can be found across the country.But within the genus Irura, this is possibly the second spider to be found in India. A specimen belonging to the same genus was recorded in 2020 in North Lakhimpur, Assam, but the species itself could not be described, explained Rishikesh Tripathi, an arachnologist affiliated with Christ College.“We were on a routine excursion near some caves in Sindhurdurg district in June this year. It was quite late in the day, and we were using our torches to get around. We saw this bright, golden coloured speck in the dark and assumed it to be some sort of light insect which was glowing at night, but on closer inspection, it was a spider. I was very surprised because I have never seen such a colourful spider,” said Tripathi, whose primary research involves studying desert spiders in Rajasthan.Researchers later obtained two more specimens (one male and two females) from the site and were able to taxonomically describe it after laboratory analysis. “We approached an American researcher named David Hill with our findings, and he confirmed it for us and suggested we publish this finding,” said Tripathi.“The Western Ghats and its rich biodiversity reveal themselves to those who have patience and tenacity. More and more new species are coming to light due to such research activities in the Western Ghats. This is another major reason why the Western Ghats need to be nurtured and protected,” the authors said in a statement issued this week, advocating for the continued protection of the area. The site of their discovery is a part of the Sahyadri hills and are recognised as a global biodiversity hotspot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/species-of-jumping-spider-spotted-for-first-time-in-india-101629915434550.html

On Friday, August 27, the first allotment list for round 1 will be declared by the department. In this academic year, a total of 78,745 students registered for Class 11 admissions. Despite a high passing percentage for Class 10 this year, registration numbers were low given that 111,205 seats are available. It is feared that a high number of seats will remain vacant this year.The Bombay HC cancelled the Common Entrance Test (CET) which was going to be conducted on August 21 for Class 11 admissions. Last year, the number of registrations was 102,851.“In the provisional merit list declared two days before a total of 199 queries were registered by the students and all of them were addressed and resolved. Now on August 27, junior college allocation list will be displayed for the round 1 admmissions. And starting from August 27 students can proceed to the admission process to the respective colleges where they have got the admission. On August 30, the junior colleges will upload the status of admitted students on their website and further admission rounds will be continued,” said Meena Shendkar, assistant director of education, Pune, who is in-charge of the admission process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/class-11-admissions-general-merit-list-declared-101629908232709.html
26-08-2021||Pune||Single-member wards for 18 civic bodies going to polls, including Pune: Maha poll commission||The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, on Wednesday, made what poll experts and analysts are calling a clear move aimed at influencing municipal elections in the state, slated in several key corporations in February 2022.The state election commission, on Wednesday, announced that wards in 18 municipal corporations in Maharashtra would now have only one council member per ward.The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) currently is allowed four council members per ward, as was in the 2017 municipal elections.Last week, Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) Ajit Pawar, also deputy chief minister, asked his party members to state their preference for a new structure at the ward level, ahead of the elections.The NCP is believed to be in favour of a two- member council at the ward level, but the state election commission’s notification, issued on Wednesday, suggests the state government has decided “single member” wards are the way forward.Mumbai has had a single-council member per ward system since 2017. Now corporations in Thane, Pune, Nashik, and Pimpri-Chinchwad will also have the same single-member system. Psephologists in the city, requesting anonymity, believe that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) favours multi-council-member wards. “If there are multi-member wards, instead of candidates, voters prefer to vote for the party. If the ward has only one council member, the candidate becomes more important than the party,” the poll expert said.“Even if any candidate has even a small pocket of influence, s/he can win the seat,” he added.The state election commission asked municipal commissioners to start the process of converting multi-seat councils to single seats from August 27.The means the preparations for the municipal elections in Pune have begun.Some political sources, also preferring to stay anonymous, said that the Maha Vikas Aghadi does have the right to allow two council members in some wards, depending on a variety of factors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/singlemember-wards-for-18-civic-bodies-going-to-polls-including-pune-state-poll-commission-101629907992672.html
26-08-2021||Lucknow||Police will be asked not to act arbitrarily in trade matters: UP official assures Allahabad HC||Uttar Pradesh’s additional chief secretary (Home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi on Wednesday assured the Allahabad high court that the state government will issue proper guidelines, directing the police authorities not to act arbitrarily in matters related to trade and business.The senior bureaucrat gave this assurance after the court pointed out that it was regularly coming across cases in which the police were arbitrarily registering FIRs (First Information Reports) under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against traders and businessmen in commercial matters.Earlier, on Tuesday, the high court directed Awasthi, and Jalaun superintendent of police Ravi Kumar and sub-inspector Kedar Singh of Nadi Gaon police station in Jalaun to remain present before the high court to show cause why appropriate orders may not be passed and why exemplary cost may not be imposed on them for filing misleading affidavits in a case.The bench comprising Justice SP Kesarwani and Justice Piyush Agrawal was hearing a petition filed by one Vishal Gupta seeking the quashing of an FIR in a case of cheating and for disobeying an order by a public servant, registered on February 20, 2021.In the petition, it was stated that the petitioner was engaged in the supply of goods. As per allegations, the petitioner was carrying eight bundles of betel nuts and tobacco in his vehicle and, on being asked by the sub- inspector, the petitioner could not show valid papers relating to the transportation of betel-nuts and tobacco. For that reason, the impugned FIR was registered under Sections 420 and 188 of the IPC, the petition said.On Wednesday, the ACS (Home) and the Jalaun SP appeared before court and filed personal affidavits, stating that action had been taken against the erring police officers in the case and a final report had been filed after investigation.The court said that such arbitrary acts of the police registering FIRs in cases involving transportation of goods in the ordinary course of business was denting the policy of “ease of doing business” of the state.On Wednesday, by filing another affidavit, the ACS (Home) apprised the court that a final report had been filed in the case. At this, the court dismissed the petition as infructuous since the final report was filed and no grievance of the petitioner was left.Earlier, on August 13, the court had observed that the FIR “reflects ill intention of the informant (sub-inspector) and obstruction in free flow of trade and commerce” and directed the respondent authorities to file a counter-affidavit (reply) in the case.On August 18, a counter-affidavit was filed by the Jalaun SP in which neither pleas made by petitioners were replied nor queries of the court were answered.The court, on this, directed the additional chief secretary (Home) to file a personal affidavit in the case by August 24, which was filed on August 23.On Tuesday, the court, after perusing personal affidavits, filed by ACS (Home) and the Jalaun SP had asked the officers to remain present in court for having filed “misleading” affidavits.During the course of the hearing, the court gave an example of another case related to matrimonial dispute in which a wife had lodged an FIR under various sections of IPC and the district magistrate (DM) had passed an order against the husband under provisions of the Goonda Act.The court citing this case said that the government must ask DMs to apply their mind and not pass orders under the Goonda Act in a casual manner.“If an order, under the provisions of Goonda Act, is passed by the DM even in a matrimonial dispute in such a casual manner, one can imagine the impact of it on the common man,” the court said while asking the ACS (Home) to address the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/upofficial-assures-allahabad-hc-police-will-be-asked-not-to-act-arbitrarily-in-trade-matters-101629907753778.html
26-08-2021||Pune||Pune’s parents, teachers & students exhausted due to online classes||With schools showing no signs of reopening and classes continuing in online mode for the second straight academic year, parents, teachers and students are experiencing exhaustion due to online teaching.Archana Panch, vice principal at the Raman Bagh English School, said, “Children understand that there is a pandemic, but they miss the school schedule. We have a lot of parents and grandparents visiting us and requesting us to reopen school. They share that children are now frustrated being at home. Children want to go out but due to the pandemic, they are not able to.”City parents expressed the view that many students want schools to reopen. Anita Salve, parent of a boy, 13, said that she is struggling to keep her son busy all day. “The physical activity is limited. Due to online platforms, the basics of the child are not very clear. Online education is not very engaging even though it is the need of the hour,” she said.Along with students, teachers too are facing a lot of issues due to online education. Harishchandra Gaikwad, president of the Pune District Principals’ Association, said, “Teachers are reaching a state of exhaustion due to online platforms. Many teachers have to follow up with students. Many students have left for their villages and teachers are trying very hard to reach them. Moreover, class attendance is just 40% and students don’t attend regular school which is a hurdle for teachers.”According to city psychologists, both teaching and learning methods need to be adaptive and relevant. Dr Shirisha Sathe, a city-based senior practising psychologist, said that teachers must realise that offline teaching methods will not work in the online mode. “Around 7% learning is verbal and 93% learning is non-verbal. Teachers have to adapt to a blended mode of teaching in future as learning will be online and offline. The whole methodology of teaching has to be reworked. And it has to adapt as per individual classes,” Dr Sathe said, adding that teachers must also interact with the national and international community to share information. “A lot of research reflects that there are many methods that teachers can utilise in teaching. An exchange of ideas will help teachers to derive their own method of teaching online and up-skill themselves,” she said.Dr Sathe advises parents to engage children in all kinds of activities at home. “Keep children engaged in other activities like music, painting and pottery, and origami where fine motor coordination and eye-and-hand coordination is present and can help them,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punes-parents-teachers-students-exhausted-due-to-online-classes-101629905952488.html

Trump said in a statement that President Joe Biden has left thousands of Americans at the “whim of Islamic extremists”, calling it the “single greatest humiliation” in the history of the US in Afghanistan.The former commander-in-chief said that Biden's policies have created a “living national nightmare” by sabotaging the economy, caving to China, and leaving the US borders wide-open to “deadly drugs, vicious crime, and unlimited illegal immigration at home.”“I created the most secure border in history.

The blast occurred from inside a crowd of Afghans close to the Baron camp, adjacent to the airport, an eyewitness told the Afghanistan media.Two blasts took place near Kabul airport on Thursday morning as several countries were carrying out their evacuation process. The commotion at Kabul airport started on Thursday when Afghan forces reportedly fired into the air to disperse crowds near the airport when an Italian military transport plane was departing. The firing was not aimed at the Italian plane, reports said. Then came the explosions one after another, reports confirmed.Kabul airport blast: 2 suicide attacks, American casualties.

And many of them are what the US military gave the Afghan army. The US has earlier said that there is no perfect estimate of what all the Taliban have plundered but they might have 2,000 armoured vehicles, including US Humvees, and up to 40 aircraft potentially including UH-60 Black Hawks, scout attack helicopters, and ScanEagle military drones, in their control. And the Taliban are ostensibly showing off their loot to the world through propaganda videos, seeing which many experts have already raised the question of whether they will be able to maintain these highly sophisticated equipment."It's no secret that the Taliban seized a major haul of US military-supplied gear when it took over Afghanistan earlier this month.

26-08-2021||World||Kabul airport blast kills at least 13, including children||A suspected suicide bomb exploded outside Kabul airport on Thursday, killing at least 13 people including children, a Taliban official said, after the United States and allies urged Afghans to leave the area because of a threat by Islamic State.The official said many Taliban guards were wounded.A U.S. official said U.S. service members were among the wounded, adding he was citing an initial report and cautioning that it could change. He said there were casualties but did not know how many or of what nationality.Thousands of people have been gathering outside the airport in recent days. Western troops are racing to evacuate foreigners and Afghans who helped Western countries during the 20-year war against the Taliban, and to get out themselves by an Aug. 31 deadline.Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said there had been an explosion and it was unclear if there were any casualties. A Western diplomat in Kabul earlier said areas outside the airport gates were "incredibly crowded" again despite the warnings of a potential attack.There were few details yet of the attack, but Western countries have been warning of a potential attack by Islamic State militants.The Taliban, whose fighters are guarding the perimeter outside the airport, are enemies of the Afghan affiliate of Islamic State, known as Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K), after an old name for the region."Our guards are also risking their lives at Kabul airport, they face a threat too from the Islamic State group," said a Taliban official, who spoke on condition of anonymity and before the reports of the explosion.U.S. President Joe Biden has been briefed on the explosion, according to a White House official. Biden was in a meeting with security officials about the situation in Afghanistan when the explosion was first reported, according to a person familiar with the matter.The concerns about an attack came against a chaotic backdrop in Kabul, where the massive airlift of foreign nationals and their families as well as some Afghans has been under way since the day before the Taliban captured the city on Aug. 15, capping a lightning advance across the country as U.S. and allied troops withdrew.Also Read | Kabul airport blast: US confirms American casualties.

U.S. and allied troops also have to plan the logistics of their own withdrawal."We wish we could have stayed longer and rescued everyone," the acting chief of Canada's defence staff, General Wayne Eyre, told reporters.Biden ordered all troops out of Afghanistan by the end of the month to comply with a withdrawal agreement with the Taliban, despite European allies saying they needed more time.In an alert on Wednesday, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul advised citizens to avoid travelling to the airport and said those already at the gates should leave immediately, citing unspecified "security threats".British Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said intelligence about a possible suicide bomb attack by IS militants had become "much firmer"."The threat is credible, it is imminent, it is lethal. We wouldn't be saying this if we weren't genuinely concerned about offering Islamic State a target that is just unimaginable," Heappey told BBC radio.Australia also issued a warning for people to stay away from the airport while Belgium ended its evacuation operations because of the danger of an attack. The Netherlands said it expected to carry out its last evacuation flight on Thursday.ISIS-KFighters claiming allegiance to ISIS-K first began appearing in eastern Afghanistan at the end of 2014 but the ultra-radical Sunni movement soon expanded from the area near the border with Pakistan where it first appeared.Daesh, as it is widely known in Afghanistan, established a reputation for extreme brutality as it fought the Taliban both for ideological reasons and for control of local smuggling and narcotics routes, according to Western intelligence services.It also claimed a series of suicide attacks in cities like Kabul, where as well as government and civilian institutions, it particularly attacked targets associated with the Shi'ite religious minority.The U.S. military has said it would prioritize evacuating its troops, numbering about 5,200, in the two days before the deadline to leave..Since the day before the Taliban swept into Kabul, the United States and its allies have mounted one of the biggest air evacuations in history, bringing out about 95,700 people, including 13,400 on Wednesday, the White House said on Thursday.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at least 4,500 American citizens and their families had been evacuated from Afghanistan since mid-August.The Taliban have encouraged Afghans to stay, while saying those with permission to leave will still be allowed to do so once commercial flights resume.The Taliban's 1996-2001 rule was marked by public executions and the curtailment of basic freedoms. Women were barred from school or work. The group was overthrown two decades ago by U.S.-led forces for hosting the al Qaeda militants who masterminded the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.The Taliban have said they will respect human rights and will not allow terrorists to operate from the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabul-airport-blast-kills-at-least-13-including-children-taliban-official-101629989297548.html
26-08-2021||World||Canada wraps up Afghanistan airlift operations||Canada on Thursday announced completion of its evacuation mission in Afghanistan. That announcement was made by Canada’s acting chief of defence staff General Wayne Eyre, as he said that “over the last day” the operation had “ceased” and the “majority of personnel departed Hamid Karzai International Airport” in Kabul with a small contingent staying behind to assist allies.On Tuesday, caretaker Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had said that Canada was “ready to stay” in Afghanistan beyond August 31 to rescue those seeking to leave. Trudeau’s statement came while speaking to reporters during a campaign stop following a G7 virtual summit.Briefing reporters on Thursday morning, General Eyre said Canada had transported or facilitated the transport of roughly 3,700 Afghan evacuees. “We wish we could have stayed longer and rescued everyone who were so desperate to leave. That we could not is truly heartbreaking but the circumstances on the ground rapidly deteriorated,” he said, adding that this was “a crisis of the Taliban’s making”.Canada announced an expansive plan to bring in 20,000 refugees from Afghanistan under a special immigration plan, but the actual figure has ended less than a fifth of the target.The early departure from Kabul may have been predicated on the United States sticking to the August 31 withdrawal deadline from Afghanistan. Outgoing Canadian defence minister Harjit Sajjan told reporters on Wednesday that as “Americans draw down to meet their deadline, partner nations, including Canada, must draw down our troops, assets and aircraft ahead of the Americans”.He said these “moves are necessary for the US to safely maintain control of the airport until they depart”.Sajjan did not specify a date, but his cabinet colleague, Afghan-origin women and gender equality minister Maryam Monsef faced flak for issuing an appeal to the Taliban, describing them “our brothers” and calling upon them “to ensure the safe and secure passage of any individual in Afghanistan out of the country.” Monsef, herself a refugee, clarified using the phrase “our brothers” was a “cultural reference” but was criticised for using such terminology. However, she asserted the Taliban was a “terrorist group” and asked the new Kabul regime “to immediately cease the violence, the femicide, the genocide, the rapes, the lootings and to return immediately to the peace negotiation table in an inclusive and meaningful way.”The situation unfolding in Afghanistan is increasingly a factor as Federal elections on September 20 approach. A poll by the agency Leger for the outlet National Post found that 65% of those sampled following developments “closely” and 54% of the opinion the government should have acted “quicker”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-wraps-up-afghanistan-airlift-operations-101629989003081.html
26-08-2021||World||'Overwhelming majority' airlifted from Afghanistan, says British PM Johnson||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday that the "overwhelming majority" of people eligible for evacuation from Kabul airport have now left Afghanistan.Johnson also reiterated that the UK government will do "everything we can" to get those remaining out of the country soon after warnings were issued of an "imminent" and "very lethal" terrorist attack from an Islamic State (ISIS) Afghanistan affiliate dubbed Islamic State Khorasan or ISIS-K.Speaking to reporters during a visit to British military's Permanent Joint Headquarters in north London to meet troops involved in evacuation efforts in Afghanistan, Johnson said, "around 15,000" people have already been evacuated by British troops."We've got the overwhelming majority of those to whom we owe that debt out of Afghanistan," said Johnson."In the time we have left, which may be – as I'm sure everybody can appreciate – quite short, we'll do everything we can to get everybody else," he said."We are coming now to the end of this phase in any event," he said, in reference to the airlift operations.The US has set a deadline of August 31 for the withdrawal of its troops, with President Joe Biden rejecting calls from Johnson and other allies for an extension.Johnson insisted the US deadline would not mark the end of the UK's efforts to help people wanting to flee the Taliban-controlled country, adding that the current airlifts were just the "first phase"."Even beyond the US deadline of the 31st of this month, we hope to be able to continue to say to people, well you can come out,” he said.Amid concerns the Taliban could block off exit routes for citizens, the British Prime Minister warned the group they must allow people to leave Afghanistan to benefit from engagement from the rest of the world."What we're hoping, and this is the key point that the G7 agreed, is that the Taliban understand that if they want to engage with development aid, they want to unlock those billions of funds, they want to have a diplomatic, political relationship with the outside world, then the safe passage for those who want to come out is the key precondition," Johnson said.Johnson also said his government had to be "transparent about the risks" posed by ISIS-K.His comments come following a stark warning by British Armed Forces Minister James Heappey that the UK had "very, very credible" intelligence that Islamic State militants are planning an “imminent” attack on those gathering at Kabul airport in an attempt to flee Afghanistan.Overnight on Wednesday, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said that the situation in the region remains “volatile”, with the advice being for British citizens and other evacuees to find a safe location and await further advice."The security situation in Afghanistan remains volatile. There is an ongoing and high threat of terrorist attack,” the FCDO updated travel advisory reads."Do not travel to Kabul Hamid Karzai International Airport. If you are in the area of the airport, move away to a safe location and await further advice,” it says.The threat has strained the airlift operation to get as many people out of Afghanistan as soon as possible following its takeover by the Taliban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/overwhelming-majority-airlifted-from-afghanistan-says-british-pm-johnson-101629985431318.html

26-08-2021||World||‘What’s your plan to ensure Taliban don’t acquire nuclear weapons from Pak?’: US lawmakers to Biden||As the August 31 deadline for the United States and its allies to pull out its troops nears, there remains mounting tension regarding the nature of rule that Islamist militants Taliban would impose on Afghanistan. Now, a group of US lawmakers has urged President Joe Biden to make sure that the insurgents do not destabilise Pakistan and acquire nuclear weapons.In a letter addressed to the President, as many as 68 lawmakers from the House of Representatives and the Senate, asked Biden to answer critical questions on the downfall of Afghanistan and what his plans are going forward.“Are you prepared to support regional allies militarily in the event that the Taliban militarise the Afghanistan border? What is your plan to help to ensure that the Taliban do not destabilise its nuclear neighbour Pakistan?” the group asked Biden in the letter.The lawmakers further noted that over the past few weeks, the world became a spectacle of Taliban’s sweeping control over Afghanistan with surprising speed — which they hailed as the result of “unforced errors made by withdrawing completely the small remaining footprint of [US’] main military force.”They also raised concerns over the unnecessary delay of the “evacuation of US personnel and its Afghan partners.”Also Read | 'Stay as long as necessary': US lawmakers implore Biden to extend Afghan airlift deadlineThe group in the letter highlighted that the effect of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan after 20 years doesn’t only have consequences in the particular nation, or even the Middle East, but also carry strategic and geographical consequences that have already commenced to unravel and will continue for decades.“Dealing with these consequences means that we must take action now to chart the course for American strategy, while we manage the immediate repercussions of this self-inflicted crisis in Afghanistan,” the letter noted, with the lawmakers asking Biden to “outline” his plan to “move America forward.”They also detailed about the swift manner in which Afghanistan “metastasised” into Taliban rule accompanied by rekindled oppression to women and girls, and the restraint of civil society.The lawmakers also pointed out that the insurgents’ comeback has triggered the displacement of innumerable Afghan nationals from their homes, who are then prevented by the Taliban by using force – and also a “power vacuum” that China seeks to fill by increasing its ties with the militants.The group of lawmakers also asked Biden to lay out his plan on ensuring that al Qaeda does not “resurge and regain a foothold in Afghanistan.” “What ‘over the horizon’ operations are you prepared to use to counter this threat?” they asked, noting that the intelligence community has cautioned against al Qaeda and ISIS-K getting full liberty from the Taliban to use Afghanistan as a safe haven to train and equip for future terrorists.Also Read | Biden defends Afghan pullout, says al Qaeda gone; Pentagon contradicts himBiden was also asked if the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan means that the group now has de facto command and control over the Afghan security forces’ former personnel, equipment and infrastructure. “If so, does this mean that the Taliban possess an air force through this de facto control? What is your plan to disable any air forces that operate under orders from the Taliban?” the letter asked.The lawmakers further asked the US President about his plan to “reclaim US military equipment” that has already fallen to the hands of Taliban, and how he plans to ensure that additional US and Afghan equipment do not end up with the militants.The 68 lawmakers’ concerns come when less than a week is left for the US to withdraw its forces from Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport. Prior to the meeting among the G7 leaders late on Tuesday, speculations were doing rounds that Biden was mulling over extending the deadline and would decide on the final date soon. The Taliban, however, had already given an ultimatum by rejecting any possibility of the deadline extension, warning that there would be “consequences” otherwise.Following these, the US President on Tuesday reaffirmed his decision to stick to the August 31 deadline.Meanwhile, German envoy Markus Potzel announced on Wednesday that the Taliban have agreed to let Afghans leave even after the August 31 deadline. He said that he met Taliban’s deputy chief negotiator Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai and his team, and that they “assured” him about allowing Afghans with “legal documents” with the opportunity to travel on commercial flights after the deadline.Pakistan has long been accused of fostering the Taliban in Afghanistan. A leader of Pakistan’s ruling Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government, Neelam Irshad Sheikh, recently said on a television news debate that the militants have said that they will help Pakistan in “liberating Kashmir from India.”Soon after regaining power in Afghanistan, Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen had said that the group won’t allow anyone to use the country’s soil against any other nation. The remarks were made by Shaheen during an interview with Pakistan’s Hum News channel wherein he also said that India is welcome to complete its reconstruction and infrastructure projects in Afghanistan.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-asks-biden-to-ensure-taliban-don-t-acquire-nuclear-weapons-from-pak-101629984335674.html
26-08-2021||World||Maldives govt signs contract for India-funded $500 million connectivity project||The Maldives government and an Indian construction firm signed a contract on Thursday for the $500-million Greater Malé Connectivity Project (GMCP), the Indian Ocean archipelago’s largest infrastructure project that is being funded by New Delhi.The 6.74-km bridge and causeway link will connect the capital of Malé with the islands of Villingli, Gulhifalhu and Thilafushi. It is being funded through a grant of $100 million and a line of credit of $400 million from India, and will boost connectivity between the four islands that account for almost half of the Maldivian population.Maldives President Ibrahim Solih and foreign minister Abdulla Shahid had sought India’s backing for the project when external affairs minister S Jaishankar visited Malé in September 2019. GMCP was conceived as an economic lifeline for the Maldives, connecting the capital with a new international port planned at Gulhifalhu, also under an Indian line of credit, and an industrial zone at Thilafushi.The detailed project report was prepared by infrastructure consultants Arup Ltd of Hong Kong, and the project will be constructed by Mumbai-based Afcons Infrastructure Limited.The project includes three navigation bridges with a main span of 140 metres across the deep channel between each island, 3.73 km of marine viaduct, and 2.96 km of roads. The project will use solar power for lighting, and solar panels will be installed atop lamp posts and along the bridge parapets.The Maldives has emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of India’s “Neighbourhood First” policy, especially after Solih assumed office in November 2018 and moved the country away from the pro-China stance of his predecessor, Abdulla Yameen.During Solih’s first visit to New Delhi in December 2018, India announced an economic package of $1.4 billion, which included line of credit of $800 million for projects such as airport expansions at Hanimadhoo and Gan, roads in Addu and an expansion of fisheries in Hulhumalé.When GMCP is completed, it will dwarf the largest Chinese-funded connectivity project, the 1.4-km Sinamalé Bridge that connects Malé and Hulhule and Hulhumalé, and was completed in 2018.Indian high commissioner Sunjay Sudhir, who attended the event for the signing of the contract, said: “The GMCP supports the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Ibrahim Solih for strong bilateral relations. The GMCP is concrete proof that India is a robust development partner of the Maldives, in addition to being the first responder in times of any emergency.”Foreign minister Shahid said in a tweet that the project will connect “peoples and countries”. He added, “This is a defining moment in the development journey of the #Maldives. Constructed with financial support from #India, the largest infrastructure project to be executed in Maldives will stand as an enduring tribute to the strong #MaldivesIndiaPartnership.”India is also implementing water and sanitation projects in 34 islands and a road project in the southern city of Addu. India has also undertaken about 30 community-oriented projects under grants worth $13 million, of which about half have been completed.Officials said enhancing connectivity within the Maldives and between the archipelago and India has been a priority area for the two governments.A direct cargo ferry service connecting Tuticorin, Kochi, Malé and Kulhuffushi began last September. India launched an air travel bubble with the Maldives in August last year, which only made India the largest source of tourists but also provided impetus to the Maldivian economy. About 60 weekly flights currently connect Malé with five Indian cities.“President Solih’s ‘India First’ foreign policy and India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy have worked in tandem and brought about mutual synergies,” an official said.A contract for building 4,000 social housing units is expected to be signed soon with NBCC and JMC in the next few weeks. The Maldives government is negotiating with Indian companies for an additional 6,000 housing units under the EXIM Bank’s Buyers’ Credit scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maldives-govt-signs-contract-for-india-funded-500-million-connectivity-project-101629983482797.html
26-08-2021||World||Why Taliban must deal with Amrullah Saleh, Massoud and Dostum: What experts say||As the Taliban are consulting with Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, analysts say that it is time for the Taliban to understand that forming an inclusive government will not be as easy as defeating teh Afghan army was. There are several tall leaders representing different communities in Afghanistan whose opinion, if not support, will be crucial to form the government. If the Taliban want to steer clear from the internal conflict like that erupted during its previous regime, they will have to take some Afghan leaders on their side. And the list does not only include Karzai, the first president of the country after the US invasion, or Abdullah Abdullah. The list also includes warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum, former vice president Amrullah Saleh and Panjshir Resistance leader Ahmad Massoud."Despite having the upper hand now, the Taliban realizes any stable governing formation will need to include influential warlords and representatives from ethnic Uzbeks, Tajiks and Hazaras. Without that, the country risks falling into the same sort of internal conflict that erupted in the 1990s," Bloomberg said.Leaders whom the Taliban must have on board and whyAbdul Rashid DostumDostum is an Uzbek warlord who was supposed to mobilise the army for Ashraf Ghani this time. But Dostum reportedly fled the country before the fall of Kabul. Reports say he is in Turkey and not part of the consultation with the Taliban. But as a former vice president and a warlord, he has a considerable influence on his people.Peace deal with Panjshir Resistance? Taliban 80% confident, claims reportAmrullah SalehThe former vice president of Afghanistan vowed to not leave the country, and neither to surrender to the Taliban. The self-proclaimed acting president of the country, one of the leaders of the anti-Taliban forces, has said that the anti-Taliban force will continue fighting and Afghanistan will not become 'Talibanistan'.Ahmad MassoudThe son of the 'Lion of Panjshir' Ahmad Shah Massoud, Ahmad Massoud, has already sought international support for his movement which he said is not only for Panjshir but for the entire country. Massoud has also said that he is in favour of talks with the Taliban and not war.Panjshir resistance is a renewed Northern Alliance that was led by Ahmad Shah Massoud when the Taliban came to power in 1996. The Northern Alliance at that time received support from India, Iran, Russia, Turkey, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. At a time when the Taliban are looking for global acceptance and countries are cautiously deliberating over this decision, an all-inclusive government with these Afghan leaders on board might make it easier for the Taliban. Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah are already in talks with the Taliban. As the Taliban took over Afghanistan, Karzai, the former president, said he would not leave the country. Abdullah Abdullah, the former advisor of the Northern Alliance, is an ethnic Tajik leader. Another Tajik leader Ata Mohammed Noor, who is currently in Uzbekistan, was one of the first leaders to call for people's uprising when the Taliban began its advances.

While the minister had reportedly clarified it by calling it a “cultural reference,” the comments had evoked a lot of responses criticising the term used by the minister.“I want to take this opportunity to speak to our brothers, the Taliban,” Monsef said during the press conference and also called on the militants to ensure the safe and secure passage of any individual in Afghanistan out of the country.Also read | Tolo News reporter beaten up by Taliban is alive“We call on you to immediately stop the violence, the genocide, the femicide, the destruction of infrastructure, including heritage buildings. We call on you to return immediately to return to the peace keeping table, to the peace deal that was negotiated and to ensure that women and minority voices are part of that discussion in a meaningful way.” she further said.A clipping of the video was shared by several people on Twitter and garnered widespread attention on late Wednesday and Thursday (IST).In her explanation to the criticism against her remarks, Monsef said “There are terrorists taking over my beloved ancestral land,” Canadian news website Globalnews.ca reported. “In terms of the terminology, if you go to masjids across the country, Muslims refer to each other as brothers and sisters, so, you know, rest assured I continue to believe deeply that the Taliban are a terrorist organization,” the website further quoted her as saying earlier on Wednesday.Notably, Monsef is the first Afghan-Canadian member of parliament in Canada’s history and is also the first Muslim to serve as a federal cabinet minister.

But the move prompted several Japanese companies to cancel worker vaccinations planned for Thursday."Moderna confirms having been notified of cases of particulate matter being seen in drug product vials of its Covid-19 vaccine," Moderna said in a statement."The company is investigating the reports and remains committed to working expeditiously with its partner, Takeda, and regulators to address this," it added, referring to Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical, which distributes the vaccine in the country.A Health ministry official said Takeda first found out about the contaminated vials on Aug. 16 and reported the issue to the government on Wednesday. The delay was because Takeda needed time to gather information on which vials were affected and where they were in the country, the official said.Moderna said the contamination could be due to a manufacturing issue in one of the production lines at its contract manufacturing site in Spain.Spanish pharma company Rovi, which bottles or "fills and finishes" Moderna vaccines for markets other than the United States, said it is investigating possible contamination of Moderna doses and the issue appeared to be limited to a few batches bound for Japan.Shares in Rovi dropped 4.6%The suspension is a fresh setback for Moderna, whose partners had production delays last month that disrupted supplies to countries, including South Korea.Moderna and Takeda did not immediately reply to Reuters' requests for comment.Japan's defence ministry, which operates a mass vaccination site in Osaka, said shots from the lot in question, which contains 565,400 doses, had been used in the western prefecture between Aug. 6 and Aug. 20, but it did not say how many people were affected.Moderna said that "out of an abundance of caution" it had put the lot in question and two adjacent lots on hold.Takeda said it conducted an emergency examination after particulate matter was found in a lot of vaccine vials at an inoculation site.Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said on Thursday the country's inoculation plan would be little affected by the issue. A day earlier, he said about 60% of the public will be fully vaccinated by the end of September and the country had enough vaccines to provide booster doses if such a decision is taken.Chief cabinet secretary Katsunobu Kato said there had been no cases reported of health issues related to contaminated shots administrated.Japan Airlines said it had cancelled some Covid-19 vaccinations for its employees on Thursday after receiving Moderna vaccines with particulate matter.Its rival ANA said about 4,700 shots of the halted Moderna lot had been used and it would stop all vaccination planned on Thursday.Japan is battling its worst wave of infections, driven by the Delta variant, with new daily infections exceeding 25,000 for the first time this month. It has inoculated 54% of its population with at least one dose and fully vaccinated 43%, according to a Reuters vaccine tracker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-suspends-1-6-million-doses-of-moderna-shot-days-after-contamination-report-101629967903863.html

While many officials are convinced that the Havana Syndrome is a sustained attack involving electronic weapons, there are also conflicting ideas about it. The condition, which seems to have almost uniformly affected US officials, has sparked several theories — from a 'microwave attack' to weapons that focused on ultrasound, poison, and even a reaction to crickets.Here's a brief run-down of the entire situation surrounding the Havana Syndrome:CasesOn Tuesday, US vice-president Kamala Harris delayed for several hours a trip to Vietnam after the US embassy in Hanoi reported a possible case involving "acoustic incidents" there, raising concerns she could be a target. Ultimately Harris did go to Hanoi, but the US state department said it was investigating a case of what the federal government officially dubbed an "anomalous health incident" or AHI. It was later unofficially called the 'Havana Syndrome' by the media.Also Read | US officials confirm 130 cases of ‘Havana syndrome’, mysterious brain injury, as CIA probes causeHowever, it is important to understand that the 'Havana Syndrome' is not new. Dozens of such cases were reported by US diplomats and intelligence officers since 2016, first in Cuba, then in China, Germany, Australia, Taiwan, and in Washington, DC itself.In July, the New Yorker magazine reported there have been dozens of cases among the US officials in Vienna, Austria since the beginning of 2021. However, the actual number of incidents reported among American officials has been kept under the wraps for security reasons.Why is it called the 'Havana Syndrome'?The syndrome was first named after Havana after the administration of former US President Donald Trump pulled the country's officials out of the Cuban capital and expelled 15 Cuban diplomats from Washington, hinting that either its government or Russia was behind the attacks.After Trump accused Cuba of perpetrating the attacks, the US government reduced staff to the embassy in the country to a minimum. The Cuban foreign minister, in turn, accused the US of lying about the incident and denied any involvement.ConcernsThere are concerns among officials of the US state department that a powerful rival, possibly Russia, is mounting the attacks, reported the AFP news agency.Following Kamala Harris' delayed trip to Vietnam, former CIA operative Marc Polymeropoulos, himself a victim of the same syndrome in Moscow in 2017, said the volume of attacks appeared to be mounting.Also Read | ‘Havana syndrome’ sickened 100 CIA officers, says chief"This is a message that they can get at our senior VIPs," he said, adding that the volume of attacks now includes intelligence officers, diplomats, and US military officers.SymptomsPeople who have been reported to be down with the Havana Syndrome have often mentioned hearing a "focused, high-pitched and sharp sound" that left them nauseated. In some cases, the afflicted had bloody noses, headaches, and other symptoms that resembled concussions.TheoriesAlthough the US government dismissed complaints regarding the Havana Syndrome for several years, instead judging them to be symptoms of people under stress or reacting with hysteria to unknown stimuli, the latest cases called for a revision.Several US officials said Russia was likely responsible for the attacks. This view was shared by CIA analysts, state department officials, and even several of the victims. It is known that Russia has a history of researching weapons that could potentially cause brain damage, such as the Cold War-era "Moscow Signal", however, there is no definitive statement from the US government yet linking Russia to the incidents.In May 2021, the New Yorker reported that the US government's "working hypothesis" was that the agents of Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU, "have been aiming microwave-radiation devices at US officials to collect intelligence from their computers and cell phones and that these devices can cause serious harm to the people they target."CauseAt the end of 2020, the National Academy of Sciences studied the available cases and concluded they appeared to represent a distinctive set of symptoms, unlike any other known disorder. Their report noted that the symptoms vary among those affected, and not all of them were tied to a perceived sharp, directed sound.However, the academy noted in its report that the best explanation for the syndrome would be "pulsed, directed microwaves". The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has also created a task force to study the issue in detail.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-havana-syndrome-the-mysterious-condition-plaguing-us-officials-101629963102505.html

And it is of an imminent and severe threat to life," Heappey told Times Radio."This is a very serious threat, very imminent," he said.Late Wednesday, Britain warned its citizens away from Kabul's airport, where huge crowds have gathered hoping to board evacuation flights after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan."Do not travel to Kabul Hamid Karzai International Airport," the Foreign and Commonwealth Office wrote on its website. "There is an ongoing and high threat of terrorist attack.""If you are in the area of the airport, move away to a safe location and await further advice," it urged, adding that "if you can leave Afghanistan safely by other means, you should do so immediately".Washington and its allies have been flying out thousands of Afghans every day on hulking military transport, but it has become an increasingly difficult and desperate task.Heappey said his advice to British citizens was "to do as the Foreign Office advice instructs and to find a place of safety."According to the latest data, 11,474 people have been evacuated by the UK since August 13, including 6,946 Afghans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-minister-warns-of-very-serious-terrorist-threat-at-kabul-airport-101629962475481.html

The US, Britain, and Australia have urged people to leave the area for safer locations.Western troops are currently trying to evacuate as many people as possible before the official date of US withdrawal looms closer. Armed Taliban fighters are guarding the periphery as expectant crowds wait to be evacuated.A Western diplomat told news agency Reuters that despite security warnings the area around the airport is “incredibly crowded” and an estimated 1,500 US passport or visa holders were still trying to enter the airport. “I learned from an email sent from London that the Americans are taking people out of here that is why I have come here so that I can go abroad,” an Afghan man told Reuters.“The situation at the airport is really bad, people are crowding and because of the rush of people, women and children are in terrible condition,” an Afghan man waiting at the gates of the airport told Reuters.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed President Joe Biden’s sentiments on Thursday, and told reporters that the US is prioritising evacuation of Americans out of Kabul, but they are committed to “getting out as many Afghans at-risk as we can before the 31st".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghans-waiting-to-be-evacuated-being-charged-40-for-a-bottle-of-water-at-kabul-airport-101629960854610.html

The spokesperson, Zabihullah Mujahid, also said that Taliban want good ties with India.Also Read: Rise of Taliban is internal security challenge for India"Afghanistan shares its borders with Pakistan. We are traditionally aligned when it comes to religion, the people of both the countries mingle with each other. So we are looking forward to further deepening of ties with Pakistan," Mujahid said during an interview with Pakistan-based ARY News.He also said that Pakistan has no role to play in Taliban's offensive to capture Afghanistan, saying the neighbouring country has never "interfered" in their affairs.Mujahid further said that Pakistan and India should sit together to resolve their outstanding issues, adding that Taliban desire good relations with all the countries, including India.Amid speculation around government formation in Afghanistan, the Taliban spokesperson said they want a government that is strong and based on Islam and which all Afghans are part of. News agency Reuters reported on Wednesday that former Guantanamo detainee Mullah Abdul Qayyum Zakir has been named acting defence minister by the Taliban. The Reuters quoted Al Jazeera news channel for the information.The Taliban have so far not formally announced the appointments, but Mujahid told ARY News that a government will be in place before the US leaves Afghanistan on August 31. "We are working on it," said Mujahid, adding that the US should not delay its plan to withdraw American soldiers.Mujahid also said that the Taliban won't allow Afghan soil to be used against any other country. He added that Taliban have seized control of all areas, "restoring peace and normalcy in the war-torn country".However, many news outlets have reported Taliban brutality in Afghanistan since they returned to power after two decades. Fox News obtained a video, which it claims shows Taliban fighters roaming around the streets of Kabul and other places and opening fire while looking for ex-government workers. The channel also reported about an incident in Takhar province where a woman was killed by Taliban fighters on Tuesday for being in public without a head covering.CNN also reported that Taliban fighters forcibly entered the house of a woman in Faryab in July and killed her for refusing to obey their command.The Taliban completely captured Afghanistan on August 15, ousting the civilian government led by President Ashraf Ghani, who fled to UAE. In the 10 days since Taliban's victory, the United States and its allies have mounted one of the biggest air evacuations ever, bringing out more than 88,000 people, including 19,000 in the past 24 hours. According to the US military, planes are taking off every 39 minutes from Kabul airport.India too has evacuated over 800 people, including Afghan Hindus and Sikhs, so far. A fresh batch of 180 people is expected to land in India today from Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-our-second-home-there-is-peace-in-afghanistan-taliban-spokesperson-101629960082702.html

26-08-2021||World||Canada’s Afghanistan evacuation mission to end today: Report||After caretaker Prime Minister Justin Trudeau emphasised on Tuesday that Canada was “ready to stay” in Afghanistan beyond August 31 to rescue those seeking to flee, it appears that the country’s evacuation mission there will actually cease in less than 24 hours.On Wednesday, the news outlet Globe and Mail reported that the last Canadian aircraft involved in evacuations from Kabul airport will depart on Thursday.Canada announced an expansive plan to bring in 20,000 refugees from Afghanistan under a special immigration plan, but the actual figure may be closer to 3,000, if the mission ends this week.The early departure from Kabul may be predicated on the United States sticking to an August 31 withdrawal deadline from Afghanistan. Outgoing Canadian defence minister Harjit Sajjan told reporters that as “Americans draw down to meet their deadline, partner nations, including Canada, must draw down our troops, assets and aircraft ahead of the Americans”.He said these “moves are necessary for the US to safely maintain control of the airport until they depart”.Sajjan did not specify a date, but his cabinet colleague, Afghan-origin women and gender equality minister Maryam Monsef faced flak for issuing an appeal to the Taliban, describing them “our brothers” and calling upon them “to ensure the safe and secure passage of any individual in Afghanistan out of the country”. Monsef, herself a refugee, clarified using the phrase “our brothers” was a “cultural reference” but was criticised for using such terminology. However, she asserted the Taliban was a “terrorist group” and asked the new Kabul regime “to immediately cease the violence, the femicide, the genocide, the rapes, the lootings and to return immediately to the peace negotiation table in an inclusive and meaningful way”.The situation unfolding in Afghanistan is increasingly a factor as Federal elections on September 20 approach. A poll by the agency Leger for the outlet National Post found that 65% of those sampled following developments “closely” and 54% of the opinion the government should have acted “quicker”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadas-afghanistan-evacuation-mission-to-end-today-report-101629953300232.html

While speaking about the 'correct usage' of modern technology, Khan said on Wednesday that sexual crimes are on the rise in Pakistan due to the "misuse" of mobile phones. The Pak premier's statement comes in the wake of a TikTok user from the country alleging that she was harassed and manhandled by a mob on Pakistan's Independence Day while shooting a clip for the video-sharing application near the Minar-e-Pakistan at Lahore's Greater Iqbal Park area.Also Read | Clothes torn, hurled into air: Pakistani TikToker says she was attacked by mob on I-DayAddressing the Punjab Education Convention in Lahore yesterday, Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan said that apart from providing quality education to the youth with the help of modern technology, it is also necessary to guide and educate them about the highest qualities of Seerat-e-Nabi (PBUH) for their "character-building". Highlighting the Minar-e-Pakistan incident, Imran Khan said that such cases are on the rise because children are not being guided in a proper way."Sexual crimes are on the rise due to the misuse of mobile phones," Khan was quoted as saying by Pakistani media. "We need to educate our children about the supreme qualities of the Seerat-e-Nabi".Also Read | Rights groups warn assaults on women on the rise in PakistanThis is hardly the first instance in a long history of Imran Khan's problematic comments regarding sexual assault. In a live television interview with Axios' on HBO earlier this year, Khan had said stoked controversies by commenting that a rise in sexual assault cases in Pakistan was linked to how women dress in "skimpy clothes"."If a woman is wearing skimpy clothes, it will have an impact on the men unless they are robots. It's common sense," he said. In the same interview, Khan also talked about the concept of 'purdah' - a religious and social practice of female seclusion in some orthodox Muslim communities - as a means to avoid 'temptation' in society.Civil society groups and activists in Pakistan have often cried out in outrage over the prime minister's remarks which pinned the blame for rape and sexual assault squarely on women themselves. Noting that these remarks are indicative of "victim-blaming", human rights campaigners called for a public apology from the prime minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-under-fire-this-time-for-linking-misuse-of-mobiles-phones-with-sexual-assault-101629950803959.html

As soon as the plane landed, military medics helped the woman deliver her baby in the cargo hold of the plane. The mother and child were then taken to a nearby hospital.Each US Air Force aircraft has a code name to communicate with other aircraft and control towers, and the code for C-17 cargo planes is usually "Reach" followed by a number.The code name for the plane that brought the Afghan family to safety was Reach 828 -- and that's how the parents decided to name the child, said General Tod Wolters, the head of US European Command.Reach and her parents are headed to the United States along with other Afghan refugees, Wolters said.Of the 7,000 people evacuated from Kabul who had passed through US bases in Europe since August 20, only 100 required medical care.Of those 100 people, 25 have been admitted to a local hospital and 12 have already been discharged. Two other babies were born after their mothers landed at the Ramstein base, Wolters said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-girl-born-on-us-military-plane-fleeing-taliban-regime-named-reach-101629947437614.html

He said if an inmate fell asleep in front of the television, prison guards promptly woke them up."You need to imagine something like a Chinese labour camp, where everybody marches in a line and where video cameras are hung everywhere. There is constant control and a culture of snitching," Navalny was quoted as saying in the interview.The key Opposition leader described the experience of a modern political prisoner in Russia as mostly “psychological hours”, where one spends mind-numbing hours in front of a pre-programmed television, which starts from the morning after calisthenics, breakfast and sweeping the yard and continues past dinner.Also Read: Russia opposition leader Alexei Navalny's health worsens in prison“We watch films about the Great Patriotic War (World War II), or how one day, 40 years ago, our athletes defeated the Americans or Canadians,” Navalny told the Times in a written exchange of questions and answers.He said, however, these eight hours of mandatory television every day had provided him with incredible clarity on Putin’s regime. He insisted that Putin was using the past to substitute both the present and the future, adding, “All sorts of past must constantly be in the spotlight to displace thoughts about the future and questions about the present”.Despite spending his days in Penal Colony number 2 since March, Navalny remained optimistic about the future, calling his regime a “historical accident” and insisted that one day this would come to an end and Russia “will move on to a democratic, European path of development. Simply because that is what the people want”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alexei-navalny-compares-prison-time-in-russia-to-chinese-labour-camps-101629946795495.html
26-08-2021||World||Covid-19 origin probe has 'stalled', window of opportunity closing fast: WHO experts||The search for the origins of the Covid pandemic that has killed millions and crippled economies is at a standstill even as time is running out, scientists charged with the task by the UN warned Wednesday.An initial report by the team of independent, international experts sent to China by the World Health Organization in January concluded that it was most likely that the SARS-CoV-2 virus jumped from bats to humans via an intermediate animal.A competing hypothesis that the virus somehow leaked from a lab, like the specialised virology laboratory in Wuhan, was deemed "extremely unlikely".But in a comment in the journal Nature, 11 of the 17 scientists on that mission said it was only intended as a "first step in a process that has stalled.""The search for the origins of SARS-CoV-2 is at a critical juncture," they wrote."The window of opportunity for conducting this crucial inquiry is closing fast."Tracing the biological trail back to the earliest pockets of the disease, which first surfaced in Wuhan in late 2019, becomes more difficult as evidence disappears or becomes corrupted.'No impediment'The statement comes less than two weeks after the WHO, in a bid to revive the probe, urged China to hand over information on the earliest Covid-19 cases.This should include Covid data for 174 infections identified in December 2019 that China failed to share during the initial investigation, the experts said.The investigators said "it was agreed" at the time that the second phase of research would fill in this gap.But China pushed back against the WHO request earlier this month, saying the January investigation should suffice and that calls for further data were motivated by politics, not science.The WHO meanwhile highlighted Wednesday that the international experts' report, published in March in coordination with their Chinese counterparts, had laid out a number of studies that should be conducted, insisting there was no reason to wait."We have encouraged all parties to pursue those studies," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters from the UN health agency's Geneva headquarters.Other WHO experts at the press conference stressed there was no need to wait for another international mission to China before delving into the many further studies needed there, pointing out that there were many capable Chinese scientists who could do the work."There is no impediment right now for those studies to go ahead, and Chinese colleagues don't need WHO to hold their hands through this kind of a process," WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan agreed."In fact, many of our Chinese colleagues do report that those studies are underway, and we very much look forward to receiving data and reports."'Diminishing returns'Beijing has especially bridled at the suggestion that the virus might have escaped from the Wuhan virology lab.On Tuesday US intelligence agencies presented President Joe Biden with a report looking at both the animal transmission and "lab-leak" hypotheses. The findings were described as inconclusive.The Nature piece noted that current data does not support the lab-leak scenario.None of the six priorities for further research mentioned after the January mission, which has faced criticism for lacking transparency and access, alluded to this possibility.Rather, the scientists emphasised the need to trace the earliest cases of Covid through disease reporting and antibody surveys, inside and outside China.They also called for further investigation of wildlife farms and wild bats."As SARS-CoV-2 antibodies wane, so collecting further samples and testing people who might have been exposed before December 2019 will yield diminishing returns," they said.They added that many of the wildlife farms of interest for study have been closed and their livestock killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-origin-probe-has-stalled-window-of-opportunity-closing-fast-who-experts-101629942993608.html

They searched his vehicle and found his UN identification. Then they beat him.On Monday, three unknown men visited the home of another UN staff member who was at work at the time. They asked his son where his father was, and accused him of lying: "We know his location and what he does."The incidents are among dozens contained in an internal UN security document seen by Reuters that describes veiled threats, the looting of UN offices and physical abuse of staff since August 10, shortly before the Taliban swept to power.While the Islamist militant movement has sought to reassure Afghans and Western powers that they will respect people's rights, reports of reprisals have undermined confidence, not least among those associated with foreign organisations.The Taliban did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the UN incident list.The group has said it would investigate reported abuses, and has also encouraged aid organisations to continue their work. It said this week that aid was welcome, as long as it was not used as a means of political influence over Afghanistan.The United Nations said it did not comment on leaked security documents.UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric added: "The authorities that are in charge in Kabul are responsible for the safety and security of UN staff and premises. We remain in touch with them in that regard."The United Nations has relocated about a third of the 300 foreign staff it had in Afghanistan to Kazakhstan. It has also stressed that it wanted to maintain a presence to help the Afghan people.There are around 3,000 Afghan UN staff still in the country. A UN spokesman has said the world body was in contact with other countries to urge them to provide visas or support temporary relocation of some of them.Thousands of people have fled Afghanistan since the Taliban entered Kabul on Aug. 15, boarding military and commercial flights from the capital where the airport has been the scene of deadly chaos.Some fear a return to the Taliban's brutal enforcement of strict Islamic law last time they ruled, when they banned women from work and girls from school.Others, including those who work in advocacy and human rights, believe they could be the target of reprisals after scores of people were killed in suspected targeted Taliban attacks in the last year.'WE ARE IN DANGER'An Afghan woman, who has worked for the United Nations for several years, told Reuters she felt abandoned."Every woman I know has the same fear as I do. What will now happen to our children if we are punished for our work? What will happen to our families? What will they do to us as women?" she said, speaking on condition of anonymity.In a video message to staff in Afghanistan on Tuesday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was distressed by reports that some had experienced harassment and intimidation."We are doing everything in our power, namely through the permanent engagement with all relevant actors, and will continue to do so to ensure your safety and well-being, and to find external solutions where they are needed," Guterres said.An Aug. 21 UN risk assessment, reported by Reuters on Tuesday, said there was "no coherent command and control" within the Taliban.The speed of their military victory, which coincided with US-led foreign troops withdrawing after 20 years of war, has left a power vacuum, and the group is scrambling to form a government in Kabul and the provinces to run the country.An Afghan UN worker, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters he knew of at least 50 Afghan staff warned or threatened by the Taliban, adding: "UN national staff who are under serious direct threat of the Taliban must be evacuated."He said the threats were not all necessarily linked to people's status at the United Nations, but were a function of the Taliban's push to impose control over Kabul.A second Afghan woman who works at the United Nations has been moving houses with her husband and 3-year-old daughter in the past 10 days. Some of her neighbors knew she worked at the United Nations, and she worried they might inform on her.She has a visa for a neighboring country, but is frustrated that the United Nations has not helped her evacuate."We were expecting the entire UN system to help us. We were honestly expecting that," the woman said. "We are in danger. And if we cannot work, who is going to reach the people?"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/internal-un-document-says-taliban-threatened-beat-afghan-staff-looted-offices-101629942173300.html
26-08-2021||World||US says 1,500 Americans may be awaiting evacuation from Afghanistan||Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that as many as 1,500 Americans may be awaiting evacuation from Afghanistan, a figure that suggests the US may accomplish its highest priority for the Kabul airlift — rescuing US citizens — ahead of President Joe Biden’s Tuesday deadline.Untold thousands of at-risk Afghans, however, still are struggling to get into the Kabul airport, while many thousands of other Afghans already have been flown to safety in 12 days of round-the-clock flights.On Wednesday, several of the Americans working phones and pulling strings to get out former Afghan colleagues, women's advocates, journalists and other vulnerable Afghans said they have seen little concrete US action so far to get those Afghans past Taliban checkpoints and through US-controlled airport gates to promised evacuation flights.“It’s 100% up to the Afghans to take these risks and try to fight their way out,” said Sunil Varghese, policy director with the International Refugee Assistance Project.Blinken, echoing Biden's earlier declarations during the now 12-day-old evacuation, emphasized at a State Department briefing that “ evacuating Americans is our top priority. ”He added, “We’re also committed to getting out as many Afghans at-risk as we can before the 31st," when Biden plans to pull out the last of thousands of American troops.Blinken said the State Department estimates there were about 6,000 Americans wanting to leave Afghanistan when the airlift began Aug. 14, as the Taliban took the capital after a stunning military conquest. About 4,500 Americans have been evacuated so far, Blinken said, and among the rest “some are understandably very scared.”The 6,000 figure is the first firm estimate by the State Department of how many Americans were seeking to get out. US officials early in the evacuation estimated as many as 15,000, including dual citizens, lived in Afghanistan. The figure does not include US Green Card holders.About 500 Americans have been contacted with instructions on when and how to get to the chaotic Kabul airport to catch evacuation flights.In addition, 1,000 or perhaps fewer are being contacted to determine whether they still want to leave. Blinken said some of these may already have left the country, some may want to remain and some may not actually be American citizens.“We are providing opportunity," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said of those Afghans, who include dual Afghan-American citizens. "We are finding ways to get them to the airport and evacuate them, but it is also their personal decision on whether they want to depart.”On a lighter note, the US military said an Afghan baby girl born on a C-17 military aircraft during the massive evacuation will carry that experience with her. Her parents named her after the plane’s call sign: Reach.She was born Saturday, and members of the 86th Medical Group helped in her birth aboard the plane that had taken the family from Kabul to Ramstein Air Base in Germany.Two other babies whose parents were evacuating from Afghanistan have been born over the past week at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, the US military hospital in Germany.In Washington on Wednesday, Blinken emphasised that the US and other governments plan to continue assisting Afghans and Americans who want to leave after next Tuesday, the deadline for Biden's planned end to the evacuation and the two-decade US military role in Afghanistan. “That effort will continue, every day, past Aug. 31,” he said.Biden has cited what he US says are rising security threats to US forces, including from an affiliate of the Islamic State terror group, for his determination to stick with Tuesday's withdrawal deadline. Germany has said Western officials are particularly concerned that suicide bombers may slip into the crowds surrounding the airport. On Wednesday, the US Embassy in Kabul issued a security alert warning American citizens away from three specific airport gates, but gave no further explanation.The US Embassy has been evacuated; staff are operating from the Kabul airport and the last are to leave by Tuesday.Biden said this week he had asked his national security team for contingency plans in case he decides to extend the deadline. Taliban leaders who took control of Afghanistan this month say they will not tolerate any extensions to the Tuesday deadline. But Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen tweeted that “people with legal documents” will still be able to fly out via commercial flights after Tuesday.US troops are anchoring a multinational evacuation from the airport. The White House says the airlift overall has flown out 82,300 Afghans, Americans and others on a mix of US, international and private flights.The withdrawal comes under a 2020 deal negotiated by President Donald Trump with the Taliban.Refugee groups are describing a different picture than the Biden administration is when it comes to many Afghans: a disorganised, barely-there US evacuation effort that leaves the most desperate to risk beatings and death at Taliban checkpoints. Some Afghans are reported being turned away from the Kabul airport by American forces controlling the gates, despite having approval for flights.US military and diplomatic officials appear to still be compiling lists of eligible Afghans but have yet to disclose how many may be evacuated — and how — private Americans and American organisations said.“We still have 1,200 Afghans with visas that are outside the airport and haven’t got in,” said James Miervaldis with No One Left Behind, one of dozens of veterans groups working to get out Afghans who worked with the US military during America’s nearly 20 years of combat in the country.. “We’re waiting to hear from the US government and haven’t heard yet.”Marina LeGree of Ascend, a US-based nonprofit that worked to develop fitness and leadership in Afghan girls and young women, described getting calls from US officials telling the group’s interns and staffers to go to the airport for evacuation flights, only to have them turned away by American forces keeping gates closed against the throngs outside.One Afghan intern who went to the airport with her family saw a person killed in front of them, and a female colleague was burned by a caustic agent fired at the crowd, LeGree said.“It’s heartbreaking to see my government fail so badly,” said LeGree, the group’s American director, who is in Italy but in close contact with those in Kabul.US-based organisations, speaking on background to discuss sensitive matters, cite accounts from witnesses on the ground as saying some American citizens, and family members of Afghans with green cards, still were having trouble pushing and talking their way into the Kabul airport for flights.Kirby said the US military will preserve as much airlift capacity at the airport as possible in the coming days, ahead of Tuesday's deadline. The military will “continue to evacuate needed populations all the way to the end,” he said. But he added that in the final days and hours there will have to be a balance in getting out US troops and their equipment as well as evacuees.Maj. Gen. Hank Taylor, the deputy director of regional operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said US forces had conducted another helicopter mission beyond the perimeter of the airport to pick up people seeking to evacuate.The number of US troops at the airport has dropped by about 400 to 5,400, but the final withdrawal has not begun, Kirby said Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-1-500-americans-may-be-awaiting-evacuation-from-afghanistan-101629940689181.html

The US embassy in Kabul has also issued an alert to American citizens present outside the gates of the airport, asking them to leave immediately due to "security threats" outside."US citizens who are at the Abbey Gate, the East Gate, or the North Gate now should leave immediately," the security alert from the US embassy in Kabul said. "Because of security threats outside the gates of the Kabul airport, we are advising US citizens to avoid traveling to the airport and to avoid the airport gates at this time unless you receive individual instructions from a US govt representative to do so."Also Read | US says 1,500 Americans may be awaiting evacuation from AfghanistanNotably, the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul is the last remaining access point for the international community to reach out to people in the war-torn country, and also the only base fortified by US troops for the remaining large-scale evacuation operations. The Taliban, which swept across Afghanistan with a lightning-fast offensive in just two months, control most other regions.Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters at a press conference on Wednesday that the Taliban have bolstered their own security at their checkpoints and have gotten involved in "crowd control"."Every day is a different day, and yesterday we estimated that crowds were about half the size they had been the previous days," Kirby said at the press briefing. "We still haven't seen them rise to the level they were in the early days of this. But yes, part of the reason is, certainly that the Taliban have strengthened their measures of access and control around the field."Also Read | Afghanistan situation: All-party meet today, Jaishankar to brief floor leadersKirby said that the US is only responsible for managing the Kabul airport till August 31, the deadline set by President Joe Biden for completion of the evacuation operations from Afghanistan. The US embassy is currently running from the airport compound, he said, adding that the Taliban are in control of Afghanistan and will have to manage the airport on their own.“I won't speak for their intentions one way or another going forward, but there's not going to be when the mission is over and when we are leaving the airport, the airport will not be the US' responsibility anymore," Kirby said. "How it gets managed going forward will be something that the Taliban...will have to manage on their own with -- and I assume with, you know, with the international community. But that won't be an American responsibility.”(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-solidify-control-around-kabul-airport-amid-evacuations-us-issues-alert-101629939864432.html

26-08-2021||World||'Profound abuse': US judge penalises pro-Trump lawyers over election lawsuit||Nine lawyers allied with former President Donald Trump face financial penalties and other sanctions after a judge said they had abused the court system with a lawsuit that challenged Michigan's election results in favour of Joe Biden.US district judge Linda Parker on Wednesday said the lawsuit last fall was a sham intended to deceive the court and the public, just a few days after Biden's 154,000-vote victory in the state was certified.“Despite the haze of confusion, commotion and chaos counsel intentionally attempted to create by filing this lawsuit, one thing is perfectly clear: Plaintiffs' attorneys have scorned their oath, flouted the rules, and attempted to undermine the integrity of the judiciary along the way,” Parker said in the opening of a scathing 110-page opinion.The lawsuit was filed on behalf of six Republican voters who wanted Parker to decertify Michigan's results and impound voting machines. The judge declined in December, calling the request “stunning in its scope and breathtaking in its reach”.The state and Detroit subsequently asked Parker to order sanctions against Sidney Powell, L Lin Wood, and seven other attorneys who were part of the litigation.The judge agreed, telling the state and city to tally the costs of defending the lawsuit and submit the figures within 14 days.Parker said lawyers for Trump supporters filed affidavits stuffed with sinister “speculation and conjecture” about the vote-counting process without checking for evidence to support the claims.“Individuals may have a right — within certain bounds — to disseminate allegations of fraud unsupported by law or fact in the public sphere," the judge said. "But attorneys cannot exploit their privilege and access to the judicial process to do the same.”Parker ordered 12 hours of legal education, including six hours in election law, for each attorney. Her decision will also be sent to the states where the lawyers are licensed for possible disciplinary action there.It was one of the few efforts to wrench fines or other penalties from dubious post-election lawsuits across the US. There was no immediate response to messages seeking comment from attorneys for Wood and Powell.“I appreciate the unmistakable message she sends with this ruling — those who vow to uphold the Constitution must answer for abandoning that oath,” said Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat.There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Indeed, election officials from both political parties have stated publicly that the election went well, and international observers confirmed there were no serious irregularities.During a July court hearing, Powell took “full responsibility” for the lawsuit and compared the legal fight to the 1954 US Supreme Court decision that outlawed racial segregation in schools.“It is the duty of lawyers and the highest tradition of the practice of law to raise difficult and even unpopular issues,” Powell told the judge, adding that efforts to impose sanctions would diminish the public's view of the court system.Wood's name was on the lawsuit, but he insisted he had no role other than to tell Powell that he would be available if she needed a seasoned litigator.In New York, Rudy Giuliani was suspended from practising law because he made false statements while trying to get courts to overturn Trump's election loss.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/profound-abuse-us-judge-penalises-pro-trump-lawyers-over-election-lawsuit-101629938881796.html

China's National Meteorological Center has forecast heavy rainfall in at least seven of its provinces.The blue alert was renewed at 8pm on Wednesday, and will remain in force till 8pm on Thursday.China has a four-tier colour-coded weather warning system, with red representing the most severe warning, followed by orange, yellow and blue.According to the weather department, downpours are expected in parts of Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Hubei, Shaanxi, Henan, Yunnan. Tibet and Inner Mongolia are also expected to receive heavy rainfall.Some of these areas are likely to encounter over 60 mm of hourly precipitation accompanied by thunderstorms and gales, the weather department said. In fact, parts of Chongqing Municipality will see up to 150 mm of rainfall, it added.China has advices local authorities in these provinces to prepare for rainstorms, suggested schools and kindergartens take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of children, and reminded drivers to watch out for road waterlogging and traffic jams.Torrential rains caused landslides, knocked out power and damaged houses in central China last week. The downpour prompted authorities to close tunnels and some bridges in Zhengzhou, a major city in Henan province.About 25 highways were closed in Henan, Shaanxi and Sichuan in the southwest, state TV reported.More than 300 people were killed by flooding in Henan in July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-revises-blue-alert-for-rain-in-southwest-region-101629937911138.html
26-08-2021||World||US to work with Big Tech, finance sector on new cybersecurity guidelines||The US government on Wednesday said it would work with industry to hammer out new guidelines to improve the security of the technology supply chain, as President Joe Biden appealed to private sector executives to "raise the bar on cybersecurity."At White House meetings with Biden and members of his Cabinet, executives from Big Tech, the finance industry and infrastructure companies said they would do more about the growing threat of cyber attacks to the US economy.“The federal government can't meet this challenge alone,” Biden told the masked executives in the East Room, telling them, "You have the power, the capacity and the responsibility, I believe, to raise the bar on cybersecurity."After the meeting, the White House said the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) would work with industry and other partners on new guidelines for building secure technology and assessing the security of technology, including open source software.Microsoft, Google, Travelers, and Coalition, a cyber insurance provider, among others, committed to participating in the new NIST-led initiative.Cybersecurity has risen to the top of the agenda for the Biden administration after a series of high-profile attacks on network management company SolarWinds Corp, the Colonial Pipeline company, meat processing company JBS and software firm Kaseya. The attacks hurt the United States far beyond just the companies hacked, affecting fuel and food supplies."We have a lot of work to do," Biden said, citing both ransomware attacks and his push to get Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold Russian-based cyber gangs responsible, and the need to fill nearly half a million public and private cybersecurity jobs.The guest list included Amazon.com Inc CEO Andy Jassy, Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Google's parent Alphabet Inc CEO Sundar Pichai and IBM Chief Executive Arvind Krishna.After the meeting, Amazon said it would make its cybersecurity training available to the public for free, and it would give multi-factor authentication devices to some cloud computing customers, starting in October.Microsoft said it will invest $20 billion over five years, a four-fold increase from current rates, to speed up its cyber security work, and make available $150 million in technical services to help federal, state and local governments to help keep their security systems up to date.IBM said it will train more than 150,000 people in cybersecurity skills over three years and will partner with historically black colleges and universities to create a more diverse cyber workforce.Google said it was devoting $10 billion to cybersecurity over the next five years, but it was not immediately clear what if any of the figure represented new spending. It also said it would help 100,000 Americans earn industry-recognized digital skills certificates that could lead to high-paying jobs.Vishaal Hariprasad, CEO of Resilience Cyber Insurance Solutions, told Reuters his company would work with the government on setting clear standards for cybersecurity, and would require policy holders to meet those standards."So, if a company is willing to adhere to the minimum standards, they'll have insurance, and if not, they'll have to identify those gaps so they can get to that baseline," he said."It's not just about getting our companies safer, but also ensuring that we're doing something to address the bad guys."Congress is weighing legislation on data breach notification laws and cybersecurity insurance industry regulation, historically viewed as two of the most consequential policy areas within the field.Executives for energy utility firm Southern Co and JPMorgan Chase & Co also attended the event.The event featured top cybersecurity officials from the Biden administration, including National Cybersecurity Director Chris Inglis and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-work-with-big-tech-finance-sector-on-new-cybersecurity-guidelines-101629930360726.html
26-08-2021||World||World Bank freezes aid; UN alleges staff beaten||The World Bank has paused disbursements to its projects in Afghanistan, citing concerns about the Taliban government’s impact on development prospects, particularly for women.“We are closely monitoring and assessing the situation in line with our internal policies and procedures,” a spokesperson for the Washington-based lender said in an email on Tuesday. “We will continue to consult closely with the international community and development partners. With our partners, we are exploring ways we can remain engaged to preserve hard-won development gains and continue to support the people of Afghanistan.”The World Bank has committed more than $5.3 billion to development projects in the nation since April 2002. As of February, it had 12 active projects belonging solely to the International Development Association (IDA) for the planet’s poorest nations, with $940 million in commitments.The bank had another 15 projects jointly with the donor-funded Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund that the bank administers, with nearly $1.2 billion in IDA funds committed. The fund has raised almost $12.9 billion from 34 donors, making it the largest contributor to Afghanistan’s budget, the World Bank had said in April.The World Bank told staff in an internal memo on Friday that its Kabul-based staff and their families had been safely relocated to Islamabad in Pakistan.The lender’s pause on disbursements is the latest setback for a new regime in Afghanistan that’s starved for cash after the US froze access to over $9 billion in assets. The International Monetary Fund said last week the regime is cut off from using fund reserve assets days before the nation was set to receive almost $500 million allocated to other countries on Monday.Concerns over UN’s claim of threat and assaultThe Taliban stopped an Afghan United Nations staff member as he tried to reach Kabul airport on Sunday. They searched his vehicle and found his UN identification. Then they beat him.On Monday, three unknown men visited the home of another UN staff member who was at work at the time. They asked his son where his father was, and accused him of lying - “We know his location and what he does.”The incidents are among dozens contained in an internal UN security document seen by Reuters that describes veiled threats, the looting of UN offices and physical abuse of staff since August 10, shortly before the Taliban swept to power.While the Islamist militant movement has sought to reassure Afghan nationals and western powers that they will respect people’s rights, reports of reprisals have undermined confidence, not least among those associated with foreign organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-bank-freezes-aid-un-alleges-staff-beaten-101629930143625.html
26-08-2021||World||Race to flee Taliban picks up pace||Afghans on Wednesday faced an increasingly desperate race to escape life under the Taliban after US President Joe Biden confirmed that evacuations will end next week. Over 80,000 people have been evacuated since August 14, but huge crowds remain outside Kabul airport hoping to flee the threat of repression in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.Biden said on Tuesday the US would stick to his August 31 deadline to completely withdraw its troops despite warnings from European allies that not all vulnerable Afghans would be able to leave by then. His worry about staying beyond the deadline is the risk of a terror attack. “The longer we stay, starting with the acutely growing risk of an attack by a terrorist group known as ISIS-K, which is an ISIS affiliate in Afghanistan,” Biden said.Afghans can leave after August 31, says GermanyThe Taliban will continue to allow Afghans who have the right documents to leave Afghanistan after August 31, Germany’s ambassador to Afghanistan said. Markus Potzel tweeted he met with Taliban deputy chief negotiator Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, who “assured that Afghans with legal documents will continue to have the opportunity to travel on flights after August 31”.The Afghan capital’s airport has been gripped by chaos as US-led troops try to maintain a secure perimeter for evacuation flights, surrounded by Afghans.The US said it will prioritise the removal of its troops on the last couple of days, the Pentagon said. There are about 5,400 troops at the airport, a number that Biden says will go down to zero by the end of the month.Two US congressmen have revealed they violated official orders to travel to Kabul during the chaotic airlift. The revelation by Democratic congressman Seth Moulton and his Republican colleague Peter Meijer prompted criticism from the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday.Xi and Putin unite in bid to handle aftermathChina and Russia on Wednesday projected a united front on the Taliban’s takeover in Afghanistan with the top leadership of the two countries pledging to enhance cooperation on handling the aftermath. In a call to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated China’s position of non-interference and respecting Afghanistan’s sovereignty.According to official media reports, Putin told Xi that he shares China’s positions and interests in Afghanistan and is willing to work together to “prevent foreign forces from interfering and destroying” Afghanistan.China on Wednesday said it has an “effective” communication channel with the Taliban following a meeting between representatives of the group and the Chinese ambassador to Kabul on Tuesday.Abdul Salam Hanafi, the deputy head of the Taliban’s political office in Qatar, met Chinese ambassador to Afghanistan Wang Yu in the Afghan capital on Tuesday.With inputs from Sutirtho Patranobis and Yashwant R||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/race-to-flee-taliban-picks-up-pace-101629929945727.html
26-08-2021||India||Second wave not over, says health secy, warns of festive season spike||The second coronavirus disease (Covid-19) wave is not over yet in the country, said Union health secretary, Rajesh Bhushan, adding that festive months of September and October will be crucial to check the case load -- a warning that comes even as Kerala witnesses a surge of infections from last week’s celebration of its biggest festival, Onam, which also marks the unofficial beginning of India’s festive season that lasts till the end of the year. “We are still in the midst of the second surge of Covid-19; it has not concluded yet. Therefore, we have to maintain all necessary precautions, particularly in the light of our experience that shows that after every festival we see a spike. Therefore, the coming months of September and October are crucial for us because we will be celebrating a few festivals,” Bhushan said in a briefing on Thursday. He warned the public that Covid-inappropriate behaviour could lead to a surge in cases. Echoing Bhushan’s warning, Balram Bhargava, the director general of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said during the press briefing that 41 districts in the country are reporting a weekly average positivity rate of at least 10%.“The second wave is still on in India and in some states an upsurge is being observed in some districts. Apart from the 41 districts with weekly test positivity rate of more than 10%, we have 27 districts with a weekly test positivity rate between 5% and 10%. Population density is causing the spread; so wherever Covid-19 appropriate behavior is not being observed, we are seeing an upsurge of cases,” said Bhargava.A positivity rate below 5% and declining is considered an indicator of the infections being under control. Kerala has at least 100,000 active cases, and four other states have between 10,000 and 100,000 active cases, Bhushan said, highlighting the need for people to not drop their guard. Bargava urged people to get vaccinated as it was crucial in containing the disease spread in the long run, and the need to keep wearing a mask.“We know that these vaccines are disease modifying vaccines; these are not disease preventive vaccines, and therefore, it is very important to continue wearing a mask even after getting vaccinated. Mask usage has to continue. We know that vaccines reduce the disease severity; they reduce the possibility of hospitalization, and also avert death to the tune of nearly 98-99%,” he added. India has administered 610 million Covid-19 vaccine doses since the national covid immunisation drive started on January 16 this year. Of the total doses administered, 6.8 million doses were administered till 7pm on Thursday.He also said that mass gatherings have to be discouraged.Experts agree that it is important for people to avoid crowded places and large gatherings for now and following Covid appropriate behavior.“These things are basic when we talk about fighting an infectious disease that is as transmissible as Covid-19. Gatherings should be avoided and wearing a mask is mandatory. Vaccination is important. The vaccines also work against variants in circulation; therefore, people should take these,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonary department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.As part of their preparations for any surge in cases, the Union government also asked states to create a buffer supply of oxygen.The second wave of Covid-19 in April and May saw a significant shortage of oxygen in some states and Union territories. “Public health facilities must have their own captive oxygen generation plant. About 1500 have been sanctioned and 900 of these have already been commissioned. Hospitals should also have medical oxygen storage tanks for which they can use the funds provided by the central government. Third element is to create equitably distributed oxygen storage units for any SOS situation,” said Bhushan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zydus-vaccine-for-kids-likely-to-be-available-by-oct-says-centre-101630002383986.html

When the government changes, they face the same action...till the time they keep favouring political parties, this is what will keep happening. It is a sad state of affairs,” observed a bench comprising Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana and justice Surya Kant.The bench made these observations while granting protection from arrest to suspended senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Gurjinder Pal Singh, who faces arrest in two separate cases involving sedition and corruption charges in Chhattisgarh.Senior advocates Fali S Nariman and Vikas Singh appeared for Singh in the two cases, which, they claimed, were foisted on the officer after he did not accede to a demand made by Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel to frame the previous chief minister of the state in certain cases of illegal gratification.In their appeals against orders of the Chhattisgarh high court denying protection to Singh, Nariman and Singh maintained that the senior IPS officer was evidently targeted due to political reasons.At this, the bench remarked that such things will continue happening until police officers do not stop associating themselves with the political regime.“In some way, the police department will have to be held responsible. Rule of law will not exist if police officers do not feel responsible and are made accountable for such behaviour,” added the bench.Representing the Chhattisgarh government, senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi opposed the plea of the additional director genera (ADG)-rank officer, emphasising that Singh has been absconding for two months and has not cooperated with the investigation. Rohatgi added that a charge sheet has already been filed in the sedition case and therefore, Singh’s petition for quashing the first information report (FIR) does not survive anymore.Rebutting the accusations, Nariman said that there was no question of Singh absconding since he has already been suspended. “The sitting chief minister called him in the middle of the night and asked him to frame the former CM. He said no and thus the cases,” contended Nariman.“The executive should not become a tool of a political party in power as the Supreme Court has pointed out. We always believe they are a responsible and important part of the government but we have not used them as the BJP government used to,” said Ravindra Choubey, agriculture minister and government spokesperson.Singh, who was appearing for the IPS officer in the corruption case relating to assets disproportionate to his known sources of income, said that he would not have been slapped with two criminal cases had he agreed to the demands of the ruling party (Congress).At this point, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for the state government in the corruption case against Singh, claimed that anti-corruption sleuths have discovered movable and immovable assets worth over ₹10 crore belonging to the officer.The bench, however, proceeded to protect Singh from arrest in both the FIRs and gave the state government four weeks for filing its formal replies to the petitions.In his first petition before the top court, the 1994-batch IPS officer asked for quashing the sedition FIR lodged at Raipur on July 8. This FIR followed the FIR registered by the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) for allegedly amassing tainted assets.According to the Chhattisgarh Police, when Singh’s house was raided by ACB, police found some pieces of papers in a drain behind the house which were later reconstructed into some notes and reports against various functionaries of the state government. As per the police, these were intended to tarnish the image of the government and destroy peace and harmony in the state.Singh has pleaded that the corruption case be handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-rues-cops-do-bidding-ofparty-in-power-101630001603058.html
26-08-2021||India||Centre launches e-portal for unorganised sector workers||New Delhi: The Centre on Thursday launched the eSHRAM-portal, “a database of urorganised workers” across the country to enable them better access to government schemes and benefits. “The eSHRAM portal will be a game changer for having the database of crores of unorganised workers and linking them to social security and other schemes of the Government from time to time,” the government said in a statement. “Though it is a big challenge but as always, the entire country has risen to such type of challenges. The eSHRAM portal would be handed over to the States/Union Territories by Shri Bhupender Yadav, Hon’ble Union Cabinet Minister for Labour & Employment, Environment, Forest & Climate Change in august presence of Shri Rameswar Teli, Hon’ble Union Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Petroleum & Natural Gas tomorrow,” The government had said that it will introduce a digitised platform for migrant workers that will enable authorities to direct state-run benefits to them and intervene during crisis, people aware of the matter said on Sunday. On June 29, the apex court, while hearing a case on the plight of workers in the unorganised sector, set a deadline of July 31 for the government to “prepare a mechanism” for the registration of such workers.Last year, tens of thousands of low-paid workers made an exodus on foot from major cities such as Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai under without much food or money following the stringent national lockdown during the first wave of Covid-19. In September 2020, then labour minister Santosh Gangwar told Parliament that the government had no data on how many migrants left the cities or how many of them died in the lockdown.The migrant workers’ portal is expected to fill this gap. It is a joint venture between the labour and employment ministry and common service-centres (CSC) run by the electronics and information technology ministry, the people quote above said.“The portal is fully ready and we will be in a position to begin registration of workers anytime and possibly go live by next week,” a labour ministry official aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity.The platform will allow migrants to register themselves and secure a unique ID to access the portal from a CSC. The CSCs are points of access to a host of government digital services across the country and there are nearly 400,000 of them. “The ID can be used to access government schemes and services, irrespective of their place of stay,” an IT ministry official said, asking not to be named.Workers will be registered as and when they apply and that could take time. “But we will launch a big awareness drive so that nobody is left behind,” said the labour ministry official.Workers in the informal economy are estimated to contribute nearly 50% to the country’s gross domestic product. “One is not clear given the humongous task of registration whether this project will be completed in the near future. The first part is registration, of course,” said KR Syam Sundar, an economist with the Xaviers Labour Relations Institute, Jamshedpur.According to Sundar, the Supreme Court is aware of the “governments’ apathy in complying with critical procedural requirements concerning unorganised workers over the (past) decade and a half”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-launches-e-portal-for-unorganised-sector-workers-101630001483029.html

Furthermore, the bench also directed the district magistrates to complete the process of approval of applications for children registered under the ‘PM-CARES for Children’ scheme in order to aid those minors who lost their parents or legal guardian due to coronavirus.The Centre informed the bench that an independent portal has been set up for the ‘PM-CARES for Children’ scheme and as of August 21 this year, a total of 2,600 children have been registered on the portal by 30 states and Union territories (UTs). Of these registrations, as many as 418 have already been given a nod by the district magistrates, the central government added.The top court noted that in case there is a necessity, the fee and other expenses of these 2,600 children, shall be undertaken by the Centre. “The state governments shall have a dialogue with the private schools to waive the fee for these students for the current academic year. In case, the schools are not willing to waive the fee, the state government shall bear the burden of the fee,” the court further said.Also Read | Over 100,000 kids were orphaned or lost a parent since April 2020: NCPCR to SCIn the matter, the apex court also pointed out that it is on the state governments to request the central government to bear the fee and other expenditure of these minors who are studying in private schools for the current academic year.It further said that it is open to the states to request the Centre to bear the fee and other expenses of these children who are studying in private schools for the current academic year.The Centre also told the apex court that the PM-CARES scheme covers the education of children until they turn 18 for support and empowerment of pandemic-affected children.Also Read | Unfair to expect children orphaned by Covid to tackle bureaucracy for some relief, Delhi HC tells state govtThe orders and exchange of information were done when the supreme court was hearing a suo motu matter on care and safeguard of children who became orphans or lost one parent or legal guardian or abandoned during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.(With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/education-of-minors-who-lost-parents-to-covid-19-must-continue-sc-to-centre-101630000730279.html

He was granted bail by a Mahad court, on a surety of ₹15,000, on the following day. On Thursday, the Union minister rushed to a private hospital for a medical check up after his sugar levels increased. Meanwhile, the Shiv Sena on Thursday claimed Rane undermined the pride and prestige of Maharashtra and action against him was taken as per the law over his controversial remarks against the chief minister. An editorial in the Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ also claimed that “Rane’s days in the Union cabinet were numbered”. “If Rane thinks he is great because of his induction into the Union cabinet, then Prime Minister Narendra Modi will surely bring him down from the pedestal,” the editorial claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rane-likely-to-resume-jan-ashirwad-yatra-today-as-sena-mounts-attack-101630001123702.html

CBI officers in Kolkata said nine cases were registered but refused to divulge details. The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) have been asked to provide security to members of the four CBI teams visiting Bengal, an officer of the CBI anti-crime branch said on condition of anonymity. Each of these seven-member teams -- which comprise deputy inspector generals and superintendents from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Karnataka and other states – is being headed by a joint director. All officers were asked to arrive in Bengal by Thursday evening. The teams are being accompanied by forensic experts and officers of inspector rank. One of the teams visited the home of Abhijit Sarkar, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker who was murdered by a mob in Kolkata’s Narkeldanga area on May 2 and inspected the scene of the crime. The Kolkata Police has so far arrested seven people in this case. The CBI officers talked to members of the family, including Biswajit Sarkar, the elder brother of the victim who had filed petitions before the Supreme Court and the Calcutta high court. Abhijit Sarkar was allegedly strangled to death with a television cable soon after the poll results were announced. He was the only BJP worker who died in the state capital. The rest of the alleged killings took place in the districts. A second CBI team visited the home of Jaiprakash Yadav, a BJP worker who died in a bomb attack by motorcycle-borne assailants at Bhatpara in North 24 Parganas district on June 6. Arjun Singh, the BJP Lok Sabha member from the local Barrackpore seat, alleged that Yadav was murdered because he worked hard to ensure the victory of Singh’s son, Pawan, at the Bhatpara assembly seat in the recent polls. CBI officers said on condition of anonymity that first information reports (FIR) were registered in Purulia, Nadia and Bankura districts as well. None of the members of the CBI teams were ready to talk to the media. On June 18, the Calcutta high court asked the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to probe the allegations of murders, rapes, extortion and arson that were raised from across the state after the March-April state polls in which the BJP won 77 seats against 213 bagged by the TMC. The BJP has alleged that 36 of its workers have been killed since May 2. After studying the final report the NHRC filed on July 13, the high court, on August 19, ordered a CBI probe into allegations of major crimes and a parallel probe into the other offences by a three-member special investigation team (SIT) comprising IPS officers posted in Bengal. The state government told the court that the NHRC report was biased and prepared with a political motive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-files-9-cases-after-bengal-post-poll-violence-probe-crpf-to-provide-security-101630001063690.html
26-08-2021||India||Right to be forgotten, left alone inherent aspects of privacy: HC||The Delhi high court has held that an individual has the “right to be forgotten” and “to be left alone” as facets of protection to their privacy. The move is significant because India does not currently have a Right to Be Forgotten (RTBF), which is part of the Personal Data Protection Bill being reviewed by a parliamentary panel. It is also significant because, in 2017, the Supreme Court held that the Right to Privacy is a fundamental right (as part of the Right to Life and Personal Liberty). Justice Asha Menon, on Monday (August 23), made the assertions while accepting an unnamed actress’ plea for removal of her nude videos from Youtube and other web portals by the next date of hearing.The court said that the “right to privacy” includes the right to be forgotten and the right to be left alone as “inherent aspects” when a person is being exhibited against his/her will.“….the plaintiff is entitled “to be left alone” and “to be forgotten”, she is entitled to protection from invasion of her privacy by strangers and anonymous callers on account of such publication/streaming/transmission of the suit videos by the defendants,” the court said.“….the right to privacy of the plaintiff is to be protected, especially when it is her that is being exhibited, and against her will,” it added. According to the plea by the actress, who acts in Bengali films, she was approached by Ram Gopal Verma for a web series. Her audition included explicit scenes, including some involving complete frontal nudity. But the project fell through and the web-series was never produced.The plaintiff claimed that in December, 2020, she came across the videos, which had been uploaded by the producer on his YouTube channel and website. He did remove them on her request, but by then, they were all over Youtube and other web portals.“Some of them also superimposed objectionable and obscene commentaries. As a consequence of such action, the plaintiff was constantly subjected to anonymous calls and also subjected to insults. Thus, the videos have resulted in loss of reputation as also great prejudice to the plaintiff’s professional endeavours,” the plea contended.In its order of Monday, the court said that the videos have a clear and immediate impact on the reputation of the person seen in the videos in a state of nudity. It added that the actress had not permitted even the producer of the videos to publish the videos on his YouTube channel, something which was respected by him.“She has also clearly stated in the plaint that the producer had actually uploaded the suit videos on his YouTube channel and the website, but as soon as she objected to it, he had taken them down. Now, if others were circulating the same for obvious monetary and other prurient benefits, the plaintiff cannot be denied any relief during the pendency of the suit,” the court said.It said that even if the actress voluntarily shot the scenes, she has clearly stated that she had not licensed the various portals and search engines to publish and transmit them on YouTube. It noted the rulings of the Madras and Orissa high court that currently, there is no statutory right to be forgotten.The matter will be heard on September 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/right-to-be-forgotten-left-alone-inherent-aspects-of-privacy-hc-101630000703655.html

According to news agency ANI, the official said that the stealing of the visas was the reason behind the Centre introducing e-visas in the first place following the fall of Afghanistan.The official added that more than 11,000 visas issued by the Indian embassy in Afghanistan between August 12 and 14 – days before Taliban regained control over Kabul, have been cancelled after so many visas were stolen. The ANI report cited that till date, nearly 300 e-visas have been issued to Afghan citizens.The intelligence agencies anticipated the stolen visas could be misused amid the mayhem that is ongoing in Afghanistan, the official told ANI. “As Taliban was approaching Kabul, the Indian embassy in Afghanistan witnessed a surge in visa applications and around 11,000 stamp visas were approved,” the official was quoted as saying.The Union home ministry announced the cancellation of all stamped visas on August 17 and introduced a new category of emergency electronic visas (e-visas) for Afghan nationals in the wake of the Taliban takeover. The Centre said that priority will be given to those citizens who stood by India or are facing threats from the insurgents’ comeback.Also Read | India makes e-Visa must for Afghan nationals, all previous visas invalidatedThe ministry said that all Afghans, regardless of their religion, will be eligible for the “e-Emergency X-Misc Visa” and applications will be processed in New Delhi since all Indian missions in Afghanistan are non-functional, people familiar with the matter had earlier told Hindustan Times.“Those who wish to travel to India can apply for this visa online following which applications will be examined and processed in New Delhi,” a government official, who didn’t wish to be named, said.The senior official mentioned above said that Afghanistan falls under the Prior Reference Category (PRC) list that mandates every visa application to go through a background check on an individual applicant. "It is a time-bound process to clear the application in the shortest time. In the process of issuing e-visas there was intense scrutiny of all applications by all concerned security agencies before giving visa approval," he told ANI, adding that any lapse could pose “threat to national security".Meanwhile, at an all-party meeting convened by the Centre on Thursday to discuss the ongoing Afghanistan conflict, Union external affairs minister S Jaishankar said that India’s top priority was to evacuate “as many as possible” as the situation in the war-torn nation is “extremely critical.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-1-000-visas-issued-by-indian-embassy-were-stolen-in-afghanistan-report-101630000141855.html

Since the fall of Kabul on May 15, Kabul airport is a scene of mayhem and chaos as thousands of Afghans are desperate to flee the country. Both the blasts took place in crowded areas apparently targeting US forces and civilians alike.According to reports, at least 13 have been killed and dozens have been injured in the twin blasts. The number can go up as the blasts took place amid a heavy crowd presence. The US has confirmed the death of four marines in the Kabul explosion.Though no group has claimed responsibility for the attack, the US has suspected IS presence behind the attack. The Taliban have condemned the attack and blamed the US forces for failing to ensure security. Taliban spokesperson on Thursday said that the area where the blasts took place was under US security. Another Taliban spokesperson said that the attack took place because of the presence of foreign forces in the airport.India is continuing its evacuation from Afghanistan as it assured that it will safely evacuate all Afghan Sikhs and Hindus. External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Thursday said the government is focusing on full evacuation from Afghanistan. Then the government will decide on its policy for Afgghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exactly-the-place-afghan-sikhs-hindus-escape-kabul-airport-blasts-101629998905747.html

Chandra Mohan Patowary, who handles the transport, industries and commerce and three other departments, made the comments on Wednesday at an event to distribute financial assistance to beneficiaries under a state government scheme for widows of Covid-19 victims in Kamrup district. He made the remark while talking about a nearly 90-year-old woman who he saw on a Guwahati footpath on Tuesday midnight without wearing a mask or taking any safety measures against the virus. Patowary, a BJP MLA, added that some people like that woman don’t get infected. “Nature has decided who would get infected, who won’t and who would be taken away from Earth. A list on it is prepared in God’s computer. It’s not any normal man-made computer, but God’s own super computer. The computer decided on sending the Covid-19 virus to Earth with 2% mortality,” he said. Patowary also blamed the World Health Organization for failing to find a cure for a “small virus” like Covid-19 despite spending billions of dollars and so much of research done about it. When journalists present at the event questioned the minister about his statements later, he tried to downplay them. “Let’s not raise that issue which is controversial. What I wanted to say was that till date there is no medicine to cure Covid-19,” said Patowary. The minister’s remarks at a time when Assam is still witnessing hundreds of new Covid-19 cases daily have evoked sharp reactions. “It is beyond comprehension that an educated person, that too, a responsible minister can make such a comment. When a person cannot manage a bad situation he will obviously put the blame on God,” said Bobbeeta Sharma, media in-charge of opposition Congress. “Because of the Centre’s lack of foresight in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic when there were early warning signs and the Modi Government’s organisation of the Namaste Trump event, disastrous consequences followed. Then they gave directions for ‘ thali bajao’ all over India to chase away Coronavirus! What can you expect from such people who lack scientific temper?” she added. Till date, Assam has recorded 586,940 Covid-19 cases with 5618 deaths. On Thursday, the state recorded 562 new cases of the viral infection, 11 deaths and a test positivity rate of 0.69%. There are nearly 7,000 active cases in the state at present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-made-in-god-s-computer-it-decides-who-will-get-infected-assam-minister-101629997403778.html

This sub-lineage is believed to have caused the recent surge in cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Israel.Also Read | Delta sub-lineages AY.1, AY.2 unlikely to be more transmissible: INSACOG“Delta is the major variant of concern in India at this time. AY.12, a reassigned sub-lineage of Delta, is being seen in many states, though the numbers need closer examination,” the bulletin, dated August 23, read. It added that at a molecular level, both Delta and AY.12 appear to be very similar despite the functional impact of changes between the two not being known.The bulletin also described AY.12 as the dominant lineage in Israel. “The rapid growth in Israel of AY.12, which is one of the reclassified Delta sub-lineages, means that it should be examined further,” it said. Additionally, the document noted that this sub-lineage does not have some of the mutations seen in the Delta parent lineage, such as G142D in spike protein.However, it is the Delta variant, which, the bulletin said, remains dominant and is causing fresh Covid-19 infections in several countries. “Delta continues to expand around the world. Despite 60 per cent of its population being fully vaccinated, Israel’s new cases are rising to near previous highs,” it said.Delta, which was first found in India, being detected here in October last year, led to the devastating second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in the country, which was at its peak in April and May. The second wave has since receded, with daily numbers oscillating between 25,000 and 40,000.Insacog, a consortium of 28 national laboratories, was set up in December 2020 to monitor the genomic variations in Sars-CoV-2, the Covid-19 causing virus.

Still many healthcare workers, many elderly and those with comorbidities have not been vaccinated, and they are the ones who have a chance of having more severe disease and dying because of Covid-19,” news agency ANI quoted the AIIMS chief as saying during the meeting. Further, Guleria said that rather than exploring boosters, if more beneficiaries were vaccinated, "we may be able to save lives.”“So I think the issue should be to vaccinate as many individuals as possible, rather than going in for three shots, four shots and trying different things, I think, let's stick to what we know right now, and focus on vaccinating as many people as we can,” he added.Briefing on the third wave of infections, he said that if the vaccinations continue in good strength and based on the serosurvey data, there might not be as many cases in the likely third wave of infections. “My feeling is that if we are able to continue to have good vaccination and looking at the serosurvey data, chances are that we may not have that many cases in the third wave,” he added.The comments came even as more than 610 million doses of the vaccine have been administered to beneficiaries in the country, the Union ministry of health and family welfare said on Thursday.

During the meeting, the overall management of the Covid-19 situation in Kerala and Maharashtra was discussed. Of the 46,164 new cases reported in the country in the last 24 hours, 31,445 were reported from Kerala while 5,031 cases were reported from Maharashtra. Bhalla, while reviewing the efforts being made by the state governments to contain the spread of infections, observed that more effort would be required to arrest the spike in infections, according to a statement by the ministry of home affairs. “This would require adequate intervention in geographical areas having higher infection, thorough measures such as contact tracing, vaccination drives and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” MHA said Bhalla also suggested that the state governments should explore the possibility of placing night curfew in areas of high positivity.“The state governments were advised that they should continue with their vaccination programmes and in case they required more vaccines, the same would be provided to the extent possible. However, efforts must be made to utilise the vaccine doses received,” it added.It was also emphasized that along with vaccination, Covid-19 appropriate behaviour must also continue to be encouraged and events with the potential of having mass gatherings during the coming festive season must be avoided. “It was also advised that testing must be ramped up in areas in the two states where positivity rates are being found to be on the higher side. Focus should also be placed over the next few months to suppress the levels of transmission of the virus so that the chain of transmission can be controlled more effectively.”Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, Dr VK Paul (member health Niti Aayog), chief secretaries and police chiefs of both the states attended the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/home-secretary-reviews-covid-19-surge-in-kerala-and-maharashtra-101629993803804.html

The birds were seized from a bus in Durgapur city, which falls under the West Burdwan district, said Agni Mitra, deputy director, WCCB (eastern region). “Four people were arrested and 658 parakeets were seized. The bus was confiscated as well,” said Mitra. Illegally sold as pets, parakeets are protected under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act. A case was registered at the Durgapur forest division. This is not the first time parakeets smuggled from other states have been seized in Bengal in such large numbers. In September 2019, the WCCB seized 524 parakeets that were trapped in 11 cages and smuggled from Patna in a bus that was intercepted in East Burdwan district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hundreds-of-parakeets-smuggled-from-allahabad-seized-in-bengal-101629988703145.html

I believe this is very much possible," he added.The minister said that the Defence Ministry, the Home Ministry and BCAS (Bureau of Civil Aviation Security) have been working together so that "counter rogue drone technology" can be developed and adopted quickly.In a notification dated August 25, the Ministry of Civil Aviation eased the rules regarding drone operations in the country by reducing the number of forms that need to be filled to operate them from 25 to 5 and decreasing the types of fees charged from the operator from 72 to 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scindia-says-new-drone-rules-will-pave-way-for-air-taxis-in-near-future-101629987623961.html

The national carrier made these submissions as a 2-judge high court bench took up its appeal against a single judge order quashing the its termination of 40 pilots, including both permanent and contractual, and directing it to reinstate them.Also Read | HC quashes Air India’s decision to terminate pilotsThe pilots’ services were terminated last year owing to the commercial slowdown due to the Covid-19 induced lockdown, during which both domestic and international services were suspended. While domestic services resumed in May last year, international flight operations remain suspended.Appearing for Air India, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta argued that the airline does not need to formally accept a resignation under the current laws, adding that the six-month-long post-resignation notice period is to ensure that there is no hardship to the passengers. “The moment you resign, the de jure relationship ends. Resignation is given de facto prospective effect after six months to ensure that the passengers are not left in a lurch. As a mandate, the law requires me to continue de facto. The resignation, however, takes effect today,” Mehta argued.Also Read | Can’t sack staff citing Covid-19: HC to Air IndiaThe original petitioners, the Solicitor General said, were offered “a better job and better prospect with a private airline,” adding that what needs to be determined is the “consequence of change of mind,” following the submission of the resignation letter. “A resignation letter is a resignation letter. The service law does not have any such things as a potential or conditional resignation,” Mehta further said.However, the bench, comprising Justice Rajiv Shakdher and Justice Talwant Singh, termed Air India’s move as a “unilateral resignation.” The national carrier, it remarked, was treading a “dangerous path.”On June 1, Justice Jyoti Singh had quashed the pilots’ termination, asking Air India to reinstate them, and pay them their back wages. The terminated pilots had initially approached the high court in July 2020 against non-acceptance of the withdrawal of their resignations. However, on August 13, they were issued termination letters by the airline.The pilots had initially quit due to a delay in disbursing of their pay and allowances but subsequently withdrew their resignations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/once-a-pilot-resigns-air-india-s-submission-to-delhi-high-court-101629987715966.html
26-08-2021||India||Why is Kerala seeing a Covid surge again? Health minister blames home quarantine||Around 35 per cent of Covid infections in Kerala have their origin in the houses, Kerala health minister Veena George said in Thursday as the state once again recorded over 30,000 fresh infections in the last 24 hours. The surge has triggered a political tug of war with the BJP blaming the Vijayan government's carelessness for the surge and the government defending its Covid mechanism.Kerala on Thursday reported 30,007 fresh infections, slightly lower than yesterday's 31,445 but the tally is still over 30,000. Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla reviewed the Covid situation of the state and asked the authorities to take immediate steps to contain the situation. Kerala health minister Veena George said the spread is mostly taking in home quarantine as people in home quarantine are violating rules. The minister said that a study has recently revealed that 35 per cent of people in the state were found to have been infected with the disease from home. While home quarantine means infected people should isolate themselves from family members as well, the present situation is that people are getting infected from other people in the family, the health minister said.The health minister said that many people are opting for home quarantine, a point the central team has also highlighted in its recent report investigating the surge of the Covid infection in the state. Veena George said n Thursday that those who have the required facilities at houses should prefer home quarantine and others should shift to domiciliary Covid-care centres.Kerala is the only state in the country reporting over one lakh active Covid-19 cases. While the post-Onam spike is not unexpected, the sudden jump from 24,000 something to over 30,000 cases per day has been worrying. The Union health ministry on Thursday said India is still fighting the second wave of the pandemic and post-festival spike has become a norm in the country."We are still in the midst of the second surge of COVID-19 in our country. The second surge has not yet concluded. It is not over and therefore, we have to maintain all necessary precautions, particularly in light of our experience that after every festival we see a spike. The coming months of September and October are crucial for us because we would be celebrating a few festivals. Thus festivals have to be celebrated with Covid-appropriate behaviour," Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-is-kerala-seeing-a-covid-surge-again-health-minister-blames-home-quarantine-101629986092395.html
26-08-2021||India||India lifts ban on Boeing 737 Max after grounding aircraft for over 2 years||The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Thursday issued an order allowing the Boeing 737 Max aircraft, banned in India since 2019, to fly in the country again.The aviation regulator had in 2019 grounded all Boeing 737 Max planes in India following the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max plane on March 10 near Addis Ababa, wherein 157 people were killed, including four Indians. The March 10, 2019, incident near Addis Ababa was the second such incident in a period of five months, as in October 2018 a 737 Max plane operated by Lion Air had crashed in Indonesia killing 180 people.“Based on design changes by M/s Boeing, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an Airworthiness Directive (AD) on November 18, 2020, mandating actions for 737 Max airplanes return to service (RTS). Concurrent with the issuance of the AD, FAA rescinded the Emergency Order of Prohibition. Subsequently, European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) also issued its own AD on February 17, 2021 which has been mandated by DGCA for compliance on Indian registered fleet,” the DGCA order said.“Post issuance of AD by FAA/ EASA and rescinding of the grounding order by FAA, DGCA has been closely monitoring the global trend with regard to un-grounding of Boeing Company Model 737-8 and Boeing Company Model 737-9 airplanes. World-wide 17 regulators have permitted operation of Boeing 737 Max airplane. A sizeable number airlines (34) with B737 Max airplane (345) are operating currently and have attained 1,22,824 total departures with 2,89,537 cumulative hours since the un-grounding from 9th December 2020, with no untoward reporting,” it added.In April 2021, the DGCA issued an order allowing foreign-registered Boeing 737 Max aircraft to fly over India after taking its permission.The European Union’’s Aviation Safety Agency had expressed concerns about the requirements of pilot training as well as on malfunction of “angle of attack” system in connection with the aircraft, which triggered an anti-stall system linked to the aforementioned two crashes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-lifts-ban-on-boeing-737-max-after-grounding-aircraft-for-over-2-years-101629985582880.html

Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said that the government has undertaken “concerted efforts” to create oxygen buffers at the state level.Bhushan made the comments during a regular press briefing by the Union ministry of health and family welfare on Thursday, in which Dr Balram Bhargava, the director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), was also present.When asked about the oxygen preparedness in the event of a third wave of infections, Bhushan said, “After the second surge (wave), there has been a concerted effort to ensure that at the hospital level and within the states at regional levels, oxygen buffers are created.” However, he also said that granular data regarding the question would be shared in upcoming press briefings.Also read | Still in the midst of Covid-19 second wave, upcoming months crucial: GovtExplaining further, Bhushan also said that oxygen buffers have been created by ensuring that public health facilities have their own captive oxygen generation plants. “More than 1,500 such plants have been sanctioned and around 900 of them have already been commissioned and they are being commissioned at a very fast pace,” he said, in what he called the first element of creating an oxygen buffer.“The second element of creating an oxygen buffer is to enable public health facilities to have medical oxygen storage tanks. There also, under the Covid emergency response package, which the Union govt has announced at a cost of ₹23,123 crore, we are providing funds to the states and UTs to procure these medical oxygen tanks and install them in hospitals wherever they are required,” he also said.To handle emergency situations related to the need for medical oxygen, Bhushan said that a senior office would be assigned to equitably distributed oxygen storage facilities at state or municipal corporation levels. He also said that the contact details of the officers would be put on “public domain” so as to enable the hospitals to know whom to contact in such situations.“If there is a SOS situation in a hospital, rather than creating unnecessary panic, they would know that these are the people who should be contacted and then the people who are manning these equitably distributed oxygen storages, they would be in a position to supply oxygen wherever it is needed,” he said.The need for medical oxygen to treat Covid-19 infections ballooned severely during the second wave of the Covid-19 infections in the country. As part of its efforts to tackle this need, the oxygen express trains were started in India on April 24, 2021. As of July 24, 2021, around 480 trains were operationalised under the plan and over 35,000MT of liquid medical oxygen were transported to 15 states, the ministry of railways had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1500-oxygen-plants-sanctioned-govt-briefs-on-steps-taken-to-meet-oxygen-demands-in-case-of-third-covid-19-wave-101629983803014.html

What government says||At present, the two doses of Serum Institute of India's Covishied are administered in a gap of 12 to 16 weeks, except in special cases. The decision was taken in May after going through international studies which revealed that the first dose of the Oxford vaccine remains effective for a long time. Hence, the second dose can be delayed, the expert panel said. Just after the gap was extended, new studies claimed that the protection offered by the first dose is not as much as previously thought. Following this, many countries shortened the gap between the two doses of the vaccine.The government earlier said that a decision on whether the gap of Covishield doses will be reduced will be taken by the expert committee based on the emerging evidence. Several reports on Thursday claimed that such a proposal to reduce the gap is being considered by the expert panel. However, NTAGI chief Dr NK Arora told ANI that there is no proposal as of now to change the dosing interval for Covishield, Covaxin or Sputnik, but the expert group is regularly reviewing the vaccine effectiveness data, he said.Covishield dose gap and its revisions in IndiaWhen India started the vaccination drive, the recommended gap between the two doses of Covishield was four to six weeks.Then the gap was extended to four to eight weeks and finally, it was recommended to administer Covishield doses apart 12 to 16 weeks.The widening of the gap received flak earlier as it was linked to the shortage of vaccines, an allegation that the government has repeatedly denied.The gap was also problematic for people who had scheduled travel and for them the government allowed a shorter gap.As India's vaccination drive is going on in full swing, several reinfection cases have surfaced. People with both doses of vaccination getting Covid infection again is not uncommon in India. Whether it has anything to do with the gap in the dosing of the vaccine is not known. Leaving Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik have a recommended gap of 28 days between the two doses.(With agency reports)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-covishield-gap-be-revised-again-what-government-says-101629982404972.html

26-08-2021||India||UP govt names two medical institutions after Kalyan Singh||The Uttar Pradesh government has decided to name two medical institutes of the state after former chief minister Kalyan Singh who died after a prolonged illness at Lucknow’s Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) on August 21. “Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has decided to name Bulandshahr’s medical college and Lucknow’s Super Speciality Cancer Institute after Kalyan Singh. After the decision, the two institutes would now be known as Kalyan Singh Rajkiya Medical College, Bulandshahr and Kalyan Singh Super Speciality Cancer Institute, Chak Ganjaria, Lucknow,” officers at the CMO confirmed. The officers said the UP chief minister took the decision keeping in view Kalyan Singh’s focus on works of public welfare.Only recently Kalyan Singh’s son Rajveer, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Etah, had praised Adityanath for being with his father’s mortal remains for three days, escorting them from Lucknow to Aligarh, Atrauli and Narora on the banks of the Ganga where the last rites of the late leader were performed. “He acted like my father’s eldest son,” Rajveer said praising Yogi Adityanath.Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya has already announced naming of roads across the state after the late leader who was the torchbearer of the Ram Temple movement that propelled the BJP’s rise to power. “We have decided to name roads at all those places that were associated with him (Kalyan Singh) after him. He was a hero of the temple movement and hence the road leading to the Ram Temple would be named after him. He served as UP chief minister twice and lived in Lucknow. Hence, a road in Lucknow would be named after him. Etah, Bulandshahr, Atrauli and Prayagraj were places connected with him and hence roads there too would be named after him,” Maurya said. The UP BJP unit is holding meetings across the state in memory of Kalyan Singh.“He was a great leader, a visionary and so he will live on in popular memory forever,” said UP BJP leader Tarun Kant Tripathi.Since Singh’s death, the BJP has targeted Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav for not going to pay his last respects to the departed leader and alleged that it was due to vote bank considerations. The SP has hit back at the BJP for trying to indulge in politics even in the death of a leader. In AMU, some protesters put up posters against their vice chancellor professor Tariq Mansoor on Monday night for condoling the demise of Kalyan Singh who, they alleged, was responsible for the demolition of the Babri mosque.UP ministers have condemned the act of the protestors and sought action against them.In September 2020, a special CBI court had acquitted Kalyan Singh and all the 31 others, including BJP veterans LK Advani and MM Joshi, who were accused of a conspiracy to demolish the mosque. The judge concluded that there was no evidence to show that the demolition was pre-planned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-govt-names-two-medical-institutions-after-kalyan-singh-101629981682734.html

The woman filed an application in this regard on Wednesday in the additional district and sessions court in Kamrup Rural district, which is hearing the case. The court accepted the application and will take up the matter on September 1 when the hearing for framing of charges will take place.Despite agreeing that there is a prima facie case of rape, Justice Ajit Borthakur of the high court on August 13 granted the accused bail. The judge said both the accused and the accuser are “future assets” and “talented students” while granting the bail. He added there was no possibility of the accused tampering with the evidence.

This was in response to the court seeking a clarification from the Centre while hearing a petition filed by Kitex Group, a Kochi-based apparel giant, to expedite vaccination process. The Centre’s counsel sought two days’ time from justice PB Suresh Kumar.Centre’s counsel Daya Sindhu Sreehari said the gap was based on a scientific study and is necessary for efficacy and effectiveness of the vaccine. The state had recently relaxed the vaccine protocol for those going abroad, the petitioner pointed out. The state said it was done in emergency cases after many countries made two vaccines mandatory. Also Read | Kerala officer who exposed illegal tree felling seeks security citing threatsIn its plea, Kitex said it has vaccinated around 5,000 of its work force with the first dose but is unable to administer the second dose due to the restrictions. It sought judicial intervention to speed up the process in view of mounting cases in the state. Kerala reported 31,455 cases on Wednesday with a test positivity rate of 19.03%, both highest in three months. Test positivity rate is the percentage of positive reports of the total tests conducted for an infection.In another plea, the Centre told the court that it has no plan for a third dose as of now. A resident of Kannur in north Kerala moved the court saying he took two doses of Covaxin but since this vaccine was not recognised abroad, he was unable to join work in Saudi Arabia. He sought the court’s help for a third dose of Covishield. For this, the Centre said mixing of vaccine was still being studied and there was no plan for a third dose yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/84day-gap-between-covid-vaccine-doses-for-better-efficacy-centre-to-kerala-hc-101629980782481.html

There were many things which were not discussed on Tuesday because Gandhi had to address a press conference,” a leader close to Baghel said. Around a dozen MLAs have also been camping in Raipur since Wednesday night, holding meetings with functionaries close to CM at the circuit house. “I got a hint from people close to the CM that a change of guard could happen in the next few weeks,” said a senior legislator on the condition of anonymity.

They know that the hierarchy will change if the chief minister changes,” said a person close to the CM. An MLA from Bastar said there was a buzz about Singh Deo staying put in Delhi till the commitment made to him was fulfilled, adding, “Something may happen in the next few days.” Singh Deo, who has stayed back in Delhi, told the media he will follow the decision of the high command. “The party never spoke about the 2-1/2-year formula. This is just media speculation...The high command decides roles for the people in the party and we carry out those responsibilities,” he said. Referring to Baghel, he said, “He might be the CM for 50 years or 10 years...This is not fixed… There is rivalry even among siblings.”On Wednesday, Baghel returned from New Delhi after meeting senior leaders to a welcome by 400-odd party workers shouting slogans as “Chhattisgarh ada hua hai, Bhupesh ke saath khada hua hai (Chhattisgarh is standing by Bhupesh)” that spoke of the power struggle within the party. Some MLAs, meanwhile, are staying away from either camp. “There is total chaos because there is no communication from the party high command...We are afraid to take sides because we know that a small mistake will ruin our political career,” said a legislator. On Tuesday, Baghel and Singh Deo met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in the presence of general secretary in charge of the state, PL Punia, and general secretary (administration) KC Venugopal, reportedly to discuss the power-sharing formula.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/baghel-to-be-back-in-delhi-on-friday-for-meeting-with-rahul-gandhi-101629980362514.html

Karnataka home minister Araga Jnanendra told ANI that the incident took place at a deserted area where the girl went with her male friend. "They should not have gone there," the minister said evoking a sharp response from the Congress.Slamming the Congress for making it a political issue, the home minister said, "Rape has happened there (in Mysuru), but the Congress was trying to rape me, they are trying to rape the Home Minister. They are trying to gain political mileage."College girl, on bike with friend, allegedly gangraped in Mysuru, CM orders probeKarnataka Congress on Thursday tweeted several allegations against the BJP and said in BJP's rule, one MLA has also been raped. Citing examples of how BJP always blame the victim, the Congress referred to the home minister's statement and said that in this case too the home minister has blamed the victim."When such incidents happen, instead of exerting pressure to see it from a humanitarian perspective and detect (the culprits), attempts are on to get political mileage in such a situation. People will see it. I will not say much on this. Instructions have been given on what has to be done by the police so that such things don't recur and we are at it," the home minister said.Congress leader DK Shivakumar said it seems the home minister likes the word 'rape'. "He (Home Minister) has claimed that Congress was raping him, he is using the word rape very lightly...it seems he likes that word. I seek the response of BJP leaders on this statement. When home minister is saying that Congress is raping him, what is the administration of the state doing?" D K Shivakumar said urging the police to arrest anyone who is "raping the home minister".On Tuesday, a college girl was allegedly raped by five men near Chamundi Hill in Mysuru. The girl was accompanied by a male friend and both of them are now undergoing treatment. The duo reportedly went to Chamundi Hill and was returning from there when they were stopped by the perpetrators.

It, however, did not allow Indian aircraft grounded in the country to fly at that time.The latest order, however, rescinds any kind of ban DGCA had earlier imposed on Boeing 737 Max aircraft, after the American aviation regulator Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European regulator European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) approved the airworthiness directive and return to service of the aircraft with extensive fixes.ALSO READ | ‘Too soon’ to let Boeing 737 MAX fly again, say families of Lion Air crash victimsThe DGCA said in its latest order that it lifted the ban after reviewing the approvals of the FAA and the EASA and on lines of 17 other regulators across the world who have also allowed flight of Boeing 737 Max aircraft."A sizeable number of airlines (34) with B737 Max airplane (345) are operating currently and have attained 1,22,824 total departures with 2,89,537 cumulative hours since the un-grounding from December 9, 2020, with no untoward reporting, " the DGCA order issued on Thursday read.The Centre had grounded all Boeing 737 Max aeroplanes in the country after the Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 operating with 737 Max plane crashed near Addis Ababa on March 10, 2019, killing 157 people, including four Indians. The crash was the second such incident in five months. In October 2018, a 737 Max plane operated by Lion Air crashed into the Indonesian Java Sea, minutes after take-off, killing 180 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dcga-lifts-ban-on-boeing-737-max-aircraft-101629978878621.html

He said that events which can lead to crowds should be strictly avoided. “We are still in the surge of the second wave of Covid-19 in our country. The second surge has not concluded. It is not over. We have to maintain all necessary precautions,” Bhushan said.84-day gap between Covid vaccine doses for better efficacy: Centre to Kerala HC“Based on our experience, we have seen a spike after every festival. The coming months of September and October are crucial because we will be celebrating a few festivals. Festivals have to be celebrated following Covid-19 appropriated behaviour,” he further added.ICMR director-general Professor Balram Bhargava pointed out that the weekly test positivity rate remains above 10% in at least 41 districts. He also said that the nation is in the midst of the second wave and there are 27% such districts where the weekly test positivity rate remains between 5-10%.Covid-19: Kerala, Maharashtra among top contributors to fresh nationwide surgeBhargava also said that the Covid-19 vaccines are ‘disease-modifying vaccines’ and not ‘disease-preventing vaccines’ and stressed upon continuing using masks to prevent further spread of Covid-19 even after being vaccinated.“Vaccines reduce disease severity and the chances of hospitalisation. They also avert chances of death to the tune of 98-99%,” the ICMR director general said.Meanwhile, Bhushan said that the cumulative recovery rate is higher than 97% as he outlined that there are 31 states with less than 10,000 active cases, four states with 10,000 to 1 lakh active cases and only one state, Kerala, with more than 1 lakh active cases. Kerala also contributed to 51.19% of the total number of active cases in the country.Availability of oxygen ahead of third waveDuring the briefing the health ministry officials also said that adequate measures are being taken to ensure there is no shortage of oxygen. It said that oxygen buffers have been created both at district and hospital levels across states and Union territories. The government is making sure that public health facilities have their own captive plants.“The government has sanctioned 1,500 such plants and 900 plants have been commissioned,” Bhushan said. He also said under the Covid Emergency Response Package announced by the Centre, public health facilities will have storage tanks and funds are being provided to hospitals to ensure setting up of such tanks at a cost of ₹23,123 crore.“We will create equitable oxygen distribution storages within a state or municipal corporation area. Each one of these storages will have to be put under the charge of a senior officer and the contact details of these officers will be shared in the public domain in situations where there is an SOS so that hospitals can contact them,” he further added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/still-in-the-midst-of-covid-19-second-wave-upcoming-months-crucial-govt-101629979070580.html

26-08-2021||India||India’s only investment in Afghanistan is on its people, will get full-value in return: Jaishankar||External affairs minister S Jaishankar today said that India had only invested in friendship of Afghan people and was sure that it would get full value of its investment in Afghanistan.Replying robustly on behalf of the Narendra Modi government before 37 leaders from 31 parties attending the all-party meeting on Afghanistan situation, Jaishankar made it amply clear that India was very much at the centre of the global diplomacy post capture of Kabul by the Taliban and the ground situation was too fluid to take a call on future ties with present regime.After patiently hearing out 26 speakers for three and a half hours in Parliament, the External Affairs Minister lucidly replied to each question and observation posed by the Members of Parliament. Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla briefed the Parliamentarians for 45 minutes before Jaishankar intervened.While the all-party meeting appreciated the ministry of external affairs for handling the Afghan situation after two clips of scenes in Kabul streets were shown with Taliban firing and general chaos, the MPs questioned what steps were India taking towards engagement with the Taliban and the recognition of the new regime in Kabul.Also Read | Afghan situation critical, evacuation priority: Jaishankar at all-party meetTo this question, Jaishankar replied that India was in a wait and watch mode as there was no certainty either on the ground in Kabul or within the international community over the new rulers of Afghanistan. He said due to divisions with the Taliban, there was no certainty about the government in Kabul, the Doha Process was in a stalemate, there is no consensus over sanctions against Afghanistan if any, law and order situation in the entire country was critical and there was no final decision on till when the US will stay in that country. Under the circumstances, Jaishankar said, it would be foolhardy to take a policy call on Kabul and India should avoid the path where events force it to take a decision and that too without full assimilating the facts on ground.To the allegation that India had been isolated, Jaishankar shot back that Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, UK Foreign Minister Dominic Raab, Saudi Arabian State Foreign Minister Adel Aljubeir have all been in touch with India. The Qatar government wants to keep in touch with India over Afghanistan and India as president of UNSC called a special session on Afghanistan on August 16. India is also playing a role as the chairman of the UN 1988 sanctions committee for listing and delisting of terror entities and individuals. The EAM fully defended the e-visa step as he said that national security was of paramount importance and all evacuees from Afghanistan were being screened.Acutely aware that the Indian mission in Kabul had been attacked thrice and consulates multiple times by terrorists, the Modi government observed deterioration of security situation in Kabul since April 2020 and took preemptive steps from time to time to ensure safety of its diplomats and citizens. Given the deterioration of situation, India based personnel were withdrawn from Herat and Jalalabad consulates in April 2020. In June 2021, India scaled down its presence in Kabul, closed down its old chancery and moved all personnel to new chancery in the most protected Green Zone of Kabul. The Indian personnel in Kandahar mission were evacuated on July 10-11, 2021 in a special flight and the Mazar-e-Sharif mission was shut on August 10-11, 2021. In the past three months, India issued no less than four advisories asking Indian citizens to leave Afghanistan.Under Operation Devi Shakti, no less than 565 people have been evacuated from Afghanistan through IAF and Air India flights and evacuation was also offered to neighbourhood countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-only-investment-in-afghanistan-is-on-its-people-will-get-full-value-in-return-jaishankar-101629975634988.html

Who is trying to destabilise the government of three-fourth majority? 'Delhi Darbar' or someone else? You should clarify. Your (Baghel’s) statement will affect the development of Chhattisgarh,” Chandrakar tweeted in Hindi tagging Baghel and Chhattisgarh Congress in-charge PL Punia.Notably, Baghel on Wednesday said that those talking about a two-and-a-half-year power-sharing deal with Chhattisgarh health minister TS Singh Deo “would never succeed” and were made to bring in political instability in the state. The reports come after Baghel along with Deo and Punia returned to Raipur on Wednesday following a meeting with Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi and party leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday.

He cannot understand the pain of farmers as he focused on the chair for two-and-a-half years,” the BJP leader added.The Chhattisgarh chief minister received a grand welcome at the Raipur airport on Wednesday following his return from the national capital.

26-08-2021||India||Police taking side of ruling party a disturbing trend, says CJI Ramana||Filing of sedition cases when regimes change is a “disturbing trend”, the Supreme Court said on Thursday while granting protection from arrest to the suspended Director of Chhattisgarh Police Academy against whom two criminal cases of sedition and amassing of disproportionate assets have been filed by the state government."State of affairs in the country is sad," said a bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana.Gurjinder Pal Singh, the 1994-batch IPS officer who had served as the IG of Raipur, Durg and Bilaspur during the earlier BJP rule, was initially booked in the disproportionate assets case following raids at his premises by state's Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) and Economic Offences Wing (EOW).Another case of sedition was invoked against him later on the grounds of his alleged involvement in promoting enmity and hatching a conspiracy against government.The bench expressed displeasure over the trend of filing of sedition cases just after senior advocate F S Nariman made opening submissions on behalf of Singh, saying “the gentleman has served as the Additional Director General of Police (ADGP) and was acting as the Director of the Police Academy and now the proceedings under section 124A (sedition) of the IPC have been initiated against him”.The bench, which also comprised Justice Surya Kant, directed the Congress-led state government not to arrest Singh for four weeks in either of the cases.It also directed Singh to cooperate with the agencies in the investigation.“This is a very disturbing trend in the country and the police department is also responsible for this... When a political party is in power, police officials take the side of the particular (ruling) party.“Then when another new party comes into power, the government initiates action against the police officials. This needs to be stopped,” the bench said.The top court issued the notice on two separate pleas of Singh to the state government, represented by senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Rakesh Dwivedi and lawyer Sumeer Sodhi.At the outset, Nariman said the issue of custodial interrogation of the police officer does not arise as the charge sheet has already been filed.The officer was once called by the present Chief Minister and asked to help in taking action against the former Chief Minister, he said.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the state government, opposed Singh's plea saying that he had been the head of the police academy in the state and “look at his conduct, he has been absconding”.“No relief such as protection from arrest should be granted to him,” Rohatgi argued.“We will consider the sedition case. This is a very disturbing trend and the police department itself is responsible for this... Do not say this that your client (Singh) was fair, your client must have acted as per the directions of the government of the day...,” the bench observed.Dwivedi also opposed granting any relief to the suspended police officer saying that the probe agency has found disproportionate assets “nine times more than the known sources of his income”.Senior lawyer Vikas Singh, representing the suspended police officer in the assets case, sought protection against any possibility of the arrest.Recently, the Chhattisgarh High Court has refused to quash the sedition case against the officer who moved the top court against the order.Earlier, the Chhattisgarh government had moved the top court by filing caveats in the matter seeking hearing if any order is passed on his plea.According to the police, the documents recovered during the ACB/EOW raids revealed that Singh was allegedly involved in promoting enmity and hatching a conspiracy against the established government and public representatives and was booked under sedition charges.Singh was booked under IPC sections 124-A (sedition) and 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc) of the IPC at Raipur’s City Kotwali Police Station.He has sought the case be handed over to the CBI or other independent agencies to ensure a fair probe.The director of the state police academy was suspended on July 5 after the ACB/EOW, on June 29, registered an FIR under the Prevention of Corruption Act in connection with the disproportionate assets he had allegedly amassed.The ACB/EOW, which carried a three-day search at around 15 locations linked to Singh from July 1 to 3, claimed to have discovered movable and immovable assets worth around ₹10 crore.During the raid at the official residence of Singh, torn pieces of paper were also found from the backyard of the house. When the pieces were rearranged, serious and sensitive contents were found to be written and typed on it, the FIR said.“These papers contained objectionable comments against leaders of reputed political parties along with detailed plans of conspiracy. Besides, secret assessments related to representatives and candidates of different assembly constituencies along with comments on serious issues of the concerned area were also written on it. The papers also contained critical comments on several government schemes, policies, social and religious issues”, it said.Similarly, the raid at Singh's associate Mani Bhushan's house unearthed a five-page document, in which comments were written in English against public representatives, officials, government schemes and policies, it added.The seized documents contain provocative content that can promote hatred and dissatisfaction against the government, the FIR said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-taking-side-of-ruling-party-a-disturbing-trend-says-cji-ramana-101629973406102.html
26-08-2021||India||SC orders transfer of ex-Unitech directors from Tihar over ED's collusion report||The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered immediate transfer of former Unitech directors Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra from Tihar Jail to Mumbai’s Arthur Road Jail and Taloja Central Jail on a report by the Enforcement Directing alleging collusion of the jail authorities in helping the accused engage in illegal activities within the prison. Expressing its displeasure over the way they are allegedly operating from Tihar jail, the apex court also directed the Delhi police commissioner to conduct an inquiry into the matter and submit a report in four weeks.The ED said it had unearthed a “secret underground office” in Delhi which was being operated by erstwhile Unitech founder Ramesh Chandra and visited by his sons -- Sanjay and Ajay while on parole or bail.The agency, which has been investigating money laundering charges against the Chandras’ and Unitech Ltd, said that both Sanjay and Ajay had rendered the entire judicial custody otiose as they had been freely communicating, instructing their officials and disposing of their properties from inside the jail.Also read | ED tells apex court Unitech assets worth ₹600cr attachedA bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah was informed by additional solicitor general Madhavi Divan, appearing for the ED, that Chandras’ had asked their officials outside the jail to communicate their instructions to those outside.“During one of our search and seizure operations, we have unearthed a secret underground office, which is being used by Ramesh Chandra and visited by his sons when they are out on parole or bail."We have recovered hundreds of original sale deeds from that office, hundreds of digital signatures and several computers which contain sensitive data with regard to their properties in India and abroad,” Divan told the bench.She said the probe agency had submitted two status reports in sealed cover to the court and had provisionally attached Unitech Ltd properties worth ₹600 crore both in India and abroad.Divan said the agency had found a very “intricate web of money trail” through shell companies and the properties were being disposed of in real time, creating a hurdle in the investigation.“They (Chandras’) have been operating from inside the jail premises. They have rendered the entire judicial custody otiose. They are freely communicating and passing on instructions with the help of people deputed outside the jail premises. ED has found that they have even tried to influence a “dummy director" when he was being interrogated by the agency”, Divan said.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the Chandras, said that nothing was done against the jail manual. The top court said it was not hearing the Chandras at present and would first hear the ED's submission.On June 4, the top court had granted 15-day interim bail to Sanjay Chandra to attend the last rites of his father-in-law after which he had surrendered.On August 14 last year, the top court had dismissed the bail plea of Chandra, who was a month earlier granted interim bail for 30 days on "humanitarian grounds" as both his parents had tested positive for Covid-19, and asked him to surrender within three days.The apex court had also dismissed the bail application of Chandra’s brother Ajay Chandra, who is in jail since August 2017.Both Sanjay and Ajay are accused of allegedly siphoning home buyers' money. The top court in its October 2017 order had asked them to deposit ₹750 crore with the apex court registry by December 31, 2017.The Chandras have claimed that they complied with the court’s conditions and they had deposited an amount in excess of ₹750 crore and, therefore, they were granted regular bail.The matter pertains to a criminal case which started initially by one complaint lodged in 2015 and later joined by 173 other home buyers of Unitech projects -- 'Wild Flower Country' and 'Anthea Project' -- situated in Gurugram.On January 20 last year, in a respite to over 11,000 hassled home buyers of Unitech, the top court had allowed the Centre to take total management control of the realty firm and appoint a new board of nominee directors.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-orders-transfer-of-ex-unitech-directors-from-tihar-over-ed-s-collusion-report-101629971800099.html
26-08-2021||India||60%-70% Indians with hypertension unaware of their condition: Study||India has one of the lowest rates of hypertension diagnosis in the world, a new study published in the peer-reviewed journal The Lancet has shown. Between 60% and 70% of men and women in the country are unaware of their condition. This lack of diagnosis further trickles down to extremely low rates of hypertension treatment leaving people predisposed to life-threatening conditions such as heart attacks and strokes. Hypertension or high blood pressure is a serious medical condition that can be easily detected at primary health care centres and controlled with low-cost treatment. Yet, India ranked 193rd for women and 170th for men in the rate of hypertension diagnosis among 200 countries, according to the study. “Low diagnosis was the main reason for India’s low treatment rate,” Dr Bin Zhou, a research fellow at the School of Public Health at Imperial College London, who led the analysis told Hindustan Times in an email. “India’s hypertension treatment rate (35% in women and 25% in men) was about one third lower than the global average (47% in women and 38% in men) and less than half of what the best country achieved (>75%).” India ranked 160th for women and 143rd for men in the treatment rate. “It means that India’s treatment rate is lower than nearly 80% of all countries,” said Zhou. An unhealthy diet which includes excessive intake of salt, saturated fat, trans fats, lack of exercise, and obesity are some of the factors linked to hypertension. A family history of hypertension and existing comorbidities such as diabetes and kidney diseases can also put one at risk of high blood pressure. Hypertension increases the risk of heart, brain, kidney and other diseases. Medical experts said that undetected and untreated hypertension is one of the key reasons for India’s high burden of cardiovascular diseases. Heart disease and stroke contributed to nearly 28.1% of total deaths in India in 2016, according to an earlier Lancet study. Medical experts in India said that diet played a big role in hypertension prevalence. “Salt intake in India has increased tremendously over the past two decades despite many awareness campaigns linking salt intake to hypertension,” said Dr Rajan Ravichandran, the founder chairman of Chennai based non-profit Sapiens Health Foundation that has been campaigning for lower salt intake. “Consumption of packaged food has gone up over the years. People pay little attention to the hidden salt content in the packaged foods,” he said. According to Ravichandran, there is also a tendency among Indians to simply link hypertension to stress and avoid medication. “While stress can be a contributing factor, there could be many other reasons for the elevated blood pressure. Avoiding medication can be damaging,” he said calling hypertension a silent killer. Mumbai based nephrologist Dr Bharat Shah agreed. “Many are not aware of being hypertensive and those who get diagnosed are often inadequately treated,” said Shah. “Hypertension is easy to diagnose and control with medication. But often, people take medication for a few days and stop it abruptly,” he said. Shah advises that everyone should keep a blood pressure machine at home. The authors of the Lancet study pointed that while nutritional, behavioural, and environmental causes of increased blood pressure are well established, there is little knowledge actions and interventions that can be widely replicated in order to reduce hypertension prevalence. Little transferable guidance exists on how to achieve high rates of detection, treatment, and control for entire populations, the authors state. Doctors in India, however, root for two crucial policies: mandatory detection of blood pressure during every visit to a doctor and a nationwide salt regulation plan. “For better diagnosis, we need to first start checking the blood pressure frequently,” said Ravichandran. “Secondly, India needs a salt regulation act in order to reduce salt content in foods. As many as 64 countries now have salt regulating laws and it’s high time for India to have one.” The hypertension study was conducted by a global network of physicians and researchers with data taken from 1201 studies including 104 million participants in the age group of 30 to 70 years. The study covered the period between 1990–2019. Hypertension was defined as having systolic blood pressure ≥140 millimeters of mercury (mmHg), diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg, and/or taking medication for hypertension. Globally, the number of adults with hypertension jumped from 650 million to 1.28 billion over the period of 30 years, the study said, adding that the burden had shifted from wealthy nations to low- and middle-income countries. Canada, Peru, Switzerland had among the lowest prevalence of hypertension in 2019. Higher prevalence was seen in countries like Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Paraguay, Hungary among others.

26-08-2021||India||Afghan situation critical, evacuation priority: Jaishankar at all-party meet||The government informed a meeting of parliamentary leaders of political parties that India’s immediate priorities in Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover were the evacuation of all Indian nationals and providing help to Afghan nationals in distress. External affairs minister S Jaishankar briefed the MPs on the latest developments in Afghanistan following the capture of the capital Kabul on August 15 after the collapse of the government of President Ashraf Ghani. Jaishankar told the lawmakers that India’s immediate priorities in the current circumstances included the evacuation of all Indian nationals, the safety of Indian diplomatic staff and providing assistance to Afghan nationals in distress, according to people familiar with the briefing. In a string of tweets, Jaishankar said: “Our immediate concern and task is evacuation and long term interest is the friendship for the Afghan people.” He said the evacuation operations were carried out in “extremely difficult conditions especially at the airport”. He added: “There is longstanding national sentiment on Afghanistan. Therefore there is national concern now at developments. We are gathered with a national spirit.” Jaishankar tweeted that India’s “strong friendship with the people of Afghanistan is reflected in the more than 500 projects we have there. This friendship will continue to guide us.” He said that “India’s footprint and activities naturally keep in mind the ongoing changes” in Afghanistan. The people cited above said India, which holds the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council for August, also chaired a special session on Afghanistan and made a statement at a session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. Besides, India is involved in international coordination and humanitarian efforts in Afghanistan, Jaishankar told the MPs. Also Read | ‘Pakistan our second home, there is peace in Afghanistan’: Taliban spokespersonHe further said India currently chairs UN 1988 sanctions committee, which oversees the designation and delisting of Taliban leaders, according to the people cited above. The sanctions committee is expected to play a key role on the issue of extending a travel exemption for sanctioned top Taliban leaders such as Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar in September. Jaishankar also informed the MPs about pre-emptive measures taken by India since last year, when the Taliban launched a campaign of attacks and violence following the signing of a peace deal with the US in February 2020. These pre-emptive measures included the withdrawal of India-based personnel from the consulates in Herat and Jalalabad in April 2020, the scaling down of personnel at the embassy in Kabul in June this year, the evacuation of personnel from the consulate in Kandahar during July 10-11, and from the consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif during August 10-11. The Indian embassy issued a series of security advisories for Indian nationals on June 29, July 24, and August 10 and 12. The final advisories asked Indians to leave immediately and warned them about the discontinuation of commercial flights. The external affairs ministry also set up a 24x7 special cell on Afghanistan and launched an e-visa system for Afghan nationals in distress. The government has so far evacuated a total of 565 people, including 175 embassy personnel, 263 other Indian nationals, 112 Afghan nationals, including Hindus and Sikhs, and 15 nationals of third countries. The government also facilitated the evacuation of Indians by other agencies. Among the challenges faced during the evacuation were frequent incidents of firing near Kabul airport and inside the city, multiple checkpoints set up by different groups, logistics and other issues at the airport, delays in obtaining landing permissions for aircraft and overflight clearances from countries in the region. The external affairs ministry’s special cell on Afghanistan, set up on August 16 to coordinate repatriation and other requests, attended 3,014 calls, responded to nearly 8,000 messages on WhatsApp and answered more than 3,101 emails. Union minister and leader of the house in the Rajya Sabha, Piyush Goyal, and parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi were present during the briefing held at the parliament house annexe. The briefing was attended by 37 leaders from 31 parties, including NCP leader Sharad Pawar, Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, leader of the Congress party in Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, TR Baalu of the DMK, former prime minister HD Deve Gowda and Anupriya Patel of Apna Dal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghan-situation-critical-evacuation-priority-jaishankar-at-all-party-meet-101629971062103.html

The court, however, upheld charges framed against the man under Section 377 (unnatural sex) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).According to a report in LiveLaw, the woman has levelled allegations of harassment for dowry and domestic abuse against her husband and her in-laws. She has also made specific allegations of her husband engaging in unnatural physical relations with her despite her protests.Reading out the order, Justice NK Chandravanshi of the Chhattisgarh High Court said, “sexual intercourse or sexual act by a man with his wife, the wife not being under 18 years of age, is not rape."“In this case, the complainant is legally wedded wife of applicant No 1, therefore, sexual intercourse or any sexual act with her by the applicant No 1/husband would not constitute an offence of rape even if it was by force or against her wish," the judge further said.The man was then discharged under Section 376 of the IPC, even though the court upheld the charges under sections 377, 498A and 34 under the same penal provisions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sex-between-married-couple-not-marital-rape-even-if-by-force-chhattisgarh-hc-101629970181481.html

These include engineering, law, veterinary sciences, fisheries and agricultural courses in universities, private colleges, government, and government-aided colleges.The Cabinet decision to table the Bill was based on the recommendation of the justice (retired) D Murugesan committee to address the issue of fewer government students getting into professional courses. “Government students competing with private students are struggling to get higher education of their choice,” chief minister MK Stalin said in the assembly, quoting data from the past few years that showed a declining trend of government students in professional colleges. Stalin said the government is introducing a 7.5% reservation in this case, similar to the 7.5% internal reservation introduced last year for undergraduate medical admissions. Also Read | IIT Madras teacher resigns citing caste discriminationThe commission recommended not less than 10% of seats to be set apart for government students in professional courses without affecting the existing reservation of the state. This would apply to students who have studied from class 6 to 12 in state government schools. The Government decided “to take affirmative action so as to bring about real equality” between government school students and private school students by “setting apart certain percentage of seats on preferential basis”, the statement regarding the Bill read. “The Bill seeks to give effect to the above decision,” it said.Last year, the AIADMK-led government introduced a 7.5% horizontal reservation to government school students who cleared the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for admissions in undergraduate medical colleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-introduces-bill-for-quota-to-govt-school-students-in-professional-courses-101629966081596.html

The two other women judges are, Telangana high court chief justice Hima Kohli and justice Bela Trivedi of the Gujarat high court.The Supreme Court currently has only a lone woman judge, Justice Indira Banerjee, who is set to retire in 2022.

This must be in addition to covering the driver, passengers and owner of the vehicle, for a period of five years. Thereafter, the owner of the vehicle must be cautious in safeguarding the interest of driver, passengers, third parties and himself/herself, so as to avoid unnecessary liability being foisted on the owner of the vehicle, as beyond five years, as on date there is no provision to extend the bumper to bumper policy, due to its non-availability, Justice S Vaidyanathan said in a recent order. The judge was allowing a writ petition from the New India Assurance Company Limited in Avalpoondurai, challenging the orders dated December 7, 2019 of the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Special District Court in Erode. The Insurance company pointed out that the insurance policy in question was only an "Act Policy", which would cover only the risk that might be confronted by a third party to the vehicle and not its occupants. The coverage for an occupant of the vehicle could be extended upon payment of additional premium by the owner of the car, the insurance company contended. The judge passed this order, which would go a long way in coming to the aid of lots of accident victims. He, however, could not come to the rescue of the claimants in this case, as the vehicle, in which their breadwinner was travelling/driving, was covered only with third-party insurance. Left with no other choice but to deprive the claimants of the accident benefits ordered by the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal in Erode, the judge quashed the order of the Tribunal awarding a compensation of ₹14.65 lakh to K Parvathy and three others. The judge, however, made it clear that this order will not preclude the claimants from claiming compensation for the death of the deceased from the owner of the car, as per the terms of the policy for which the car was insured. Before parting with this judgment, the judge said that it is saddening to point out that when a vehicle is sold, the purchaser/ buyer is not clearly informed about the terms of policy and its importance. Similarly, at the time of buying the vehicle, the buyer is also not interested in thoroughly understanding the terms and conditions of the policy, as he/ she is more concerned about the vehicle's performance and not about the policy. When a buyer is ready to pay a huge amount for purchase of a vehicle, it is really shocking as to why he/ she is not interested in spending a paltry sum to take a policy so as to safeguard himself/ herself and others. "Therefore, this court directs that whenever a new vehicle is sold after September 1, it is mandatory for coverage of bumper to bumper insurance every year, in addition to covering the driver, passengers and owner of the vehicle, for a period of five years. Thereafter, the owner of the vehicle must be cautious in safeguarding the interest of driver, passengers, third parties and himself/ herself, so as to avoid unnecessary liability being foisted on the owner of the vehicle, as beyond five years, as on date there is no provision to extend the bumper to bumper policy, due to its non-availability, the judge said. In view of untoward incidents like the present one on hand, the order shall be circulated by the Additional Chief Secretary, Transport department, to all the insurance companies and he must ensure that the above direction is followed scrupulously in letter and spirit without any deviation, the judge added and posted the matter on September 30 for reporting compliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bumpertobumper-insurance-to-be-mandatory-for-all-new-vehicles-from-september-1-madras-hc-101629964267957.html

I urge it to follow ICMR guidelines."The health ministry data show that Kerala alone accounted for over 68% of India's caseload on Thursday, after the southern state recorded 31,445 cases out of 46,164 Covid-19 infection that India recorded on Wednesday. With a test positivity rate of 19.03% , it was the highest case tally for Kerala in the past three months, with Ernakulam (4,048 cases) and Thrissur (3,865 cases) being the worst-affected districts. The national test positivity rate on Wednesday was only 2%. "Kerala's home quarantine plan has miserably failed," Muraleedharan told news agency ANI.The Kerala government blamed the spike in the number of cases to the festival of Onam, which was celebrated last week.Even as Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan cautioned the states regarding a surge in Covid cases owing to the upcoming festival season, and advised them to undertake public health measures to curb the spread of the infection, bazaars across the state were found chock-a-block with people in ahead of Onam.The Union minister of state for external affairs claimed that the testing mechanism, as suggested by the ICMR and the number of samples being tested for Covid-19 were less in Kerala."The state should give more attention to restricting the spread of the virus," Muraleedharan was quoted as saying by ANI in a tweet.ALSO READ | Covid-19: Kerala, Maharashtra among top contributors to fresh nationwide surgeThe fourth round of the sero survey conducted by the ICMR in July showed antibody prevalence was 67. 7% nationally but it was only 42.7 % in Kerala, signifying that a large chunk of its population is still susceptible to the virus.However, the state of vaccination in Kerala paints a positive picture, with 56.28% of the population having received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine.V Muraleedharan has been a strong critic of the Pinarayi Vijayan government in Kerala. On Wednesday, he hit out at the LDF government and said it “clearly failed” to protect people’s lives.Earlier this month, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya had visited Kerala and announced a ₹267.35 crore package for the state government to strengthen its fight against the viral disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-covid-19-pandemic-v-muraleedharan-pinarayi-vijayan-icmr-101629956628881.html

While the two-and-a-half year marked passed on June 17, there have been several bookmarks in the past two months of the conflict, eventually leading to the meeting on Tuesday.Party functionaries in Delhi and Raipur said there were indications that the chief minister could step down, with the CM saying that he will leave the post when the party high command tells him to.“As far as the incumbent state government is concerned, Sonia ji (Sonia Gandhi) and Rahul ji ( Rahul Gandhi) entrusted responsibility to a farmer like me. I am happy about it. This government is of farmers, tribals, labourers and 2.80 crore people of the state. The government is functioning well… Those who are propagating the two-and-a-half-year formula and are trying to bring political instability and they will never succeed,” Baghel said.People close to him said indicated that another meeting in Delhi was likely in the next few days.Landing at Raipur earlier on Wednesday, Baghel was greeted by around 400 party workers, who shouted slogans such as “Chhattisgarh ada hua hai, Bhupesh ke saath khada hua hai (Chhattisgarh is adamant, is standing by Bhupesh) that spoke of the power struggle within the party.Among the supporters waiting for Baghel at Raipur airport were eight MLAs from different districts and ministers Amarjeet Bhagat and Ravindra Choubey. They declined to comment.Earlier in the morning, CM Baghel, who was camping at Chhattisgarh Bhawan in New Delhi, met Venugopal at around 11.30am for 25 minutes. After Baghel’s meeting with Venugopal, sources claimed that a meeting between Singh Deo and Venugopal also took place, which lasted for a similar period of time.Functionaries close to Singh Deo did not specify when he will return to the state capital.One legislator who asked not to be named said that the uncertainty of who will lead Chhattisgarh was becoming a tricky situation for them to navigate, with many hedging their bets. “This is a testing time for the MLAs of Chhattisgarh, who are trapped between the politics of Singh Deo and Baghel. For us taking sides will be very difficult which could cause further distrust and infighting,” the MLA said.Political commentators in the state said that the uncertainty on the issue of leadership was a poor message for a party that won a huge majority.“In Chhattisgarh, Congress has won huge majority and the uncertainty on leadership issue is not good for it. The statement issued and language used by all stake holders in this regard lacks clarity. The sooner it is resolved the better in the interest of the party,” said Sudeip Shrivastva , a political commentator based in Chhattisgarh.The Bharatiya Janata Party ruled the state for 15 years until 2018, with former chief minister Raman Singh in power for three terms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chief-minister-bhupesh-baghel-returns-to-chhattisgarh-to-show-of-strength-101629964281318.html

They also streamline a labyrinthine certification process for manufacturers, importers and users.“India has the potential to be a global drone hub by 2030 as drones offer tremendous benefits to all sectors of the economy and can be significant creators of employment and economic growth due to their reach, versatility, and ease of use,” the ministry said on Thursday.Also Read | BSF opens fire at drone in Jammu’s Arnia sectorAccording to the new rules, special drone corridors will be developed for cargo deliveries. Several approvals have also been abolished. They include unique authorisation number, unique prototype identification number, certificate of manufacturing and airworthiness, certificate of conformance, certificate of maintenance, import clearance, acceptance of existing drones, operator permits, authorisation of R&D organisation, student remote pilot licence, remote pilot instructor authorisation, drone port authorisation etc.Building on its attempt to make rules easier, the new rules say no pilot licence will be required for micro drones (for non-commercial use), nano drones and for R&D organisations. There will no longer be a ban on the use of drones by foreign-owned companies registered in India. No security clearance will be required before any registration or licence is issued.The government plans to open what is known as the Digital Sky platform, which manufacturers will be able to use for the certification process, and from where interactive airspace maps with green, yellow, and red zones can be accessed.Digital Sky will also serve as a unified platform for users to obtain the mandatory registration number and remote pilot license. People will need to check the service to determine if any restrictions are in place before they fly a drone at a location. The platform will be under India’s aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation.Drones have been under the spotlight since such a device was used to target an Indian Air Force base in Jammu with explosives in June. Officials have since said they are working on anti-drone technologies. Typical consumer drones usually have some inbuilt safeguards, which mean not all are unsafe.Drones now form a significant new consumer tech category, particularly among hobbyists and visual artists, and are being tested for a range of practical as well as industrial uses such as automated package deliveries by e-commerce companies.In March, the civil aviation ministry published the UAS Rules, 2021. “They were perceived by academia, Startups, end-users and other stakeholders as being restrictive in nature as they involved considerable paperwork, required permissions for every drone flight and very few ‘free to fly’ green zones were available. Based on the feedback, the Government has decided to repeal the UAS Rules, 2021 and replace the same with the liberalised Drone Rules, 2021,” the aviation ministry said.“Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), commonly known as drones, offer tremendous benefits to almost all sectors of the economy like – agriculture, mining, infrastructure, surveillance, emergency response, transportation, geo-spatial mapping, defence, and law enforcement etc,” the ministry said.Drones can be significant creators of employment and economic growth due to their reach, versatility, and ease of use, especially in India’s remote and inaccessible areas, the ministry noted. “In view of its traditional strengths in innovation, information technology, frugal engineering and huge domestic demand. India has the potential to be global drone hub by 2030,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-notifies-liberalised-drone-rules-to-replace-unmanned-aircraft-norms-101629962961393.html

The incident took place close to a market and barely 150 metres from the Changsari police station at 5:30 pm on NH31. The condition of the woman, who sustained severe injuries on her stomach, is stated to be critical, police said. “The victim, Manowara Begum, and the accused, Imram Hussain, are said to have been in a relationship. But the victim started avoiding him since January this year. This angered Hussain and he attacked her brutally on Wednesday evening,” Hitesh Roy, superintendent of police, Kamrup Rural, said. “The victim received several injuries to her stomach and internal organs. The accused was later surrounded by people present near the spot and handed over to the police,” he added. The woman was first rushed to a nearby hospital from where she was shifted to a private hospital, from where she was moved to Guwahati Medical College Hospital, where she is currently battling for her life. Wednesday’s incident happened four days after a 2nd year college student was attacked with a machete by an employee of the same college at Dhemaji. The victim succumbed to her injuries at a hospital in Dibrugarh on Wednesday. The accused, who was arrested the same day, attacked her allegedly for refusing to marry him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-man-arrested-for-attacking-woman-with-cleaver-2nd-incident-in-a-week-101629962421417.html

The state mining department and NMDC organise auctions of diamonds in Panna and in other cities.Panna Diamond Merchants Association president Shrinivas Richariya said a large number of businessmen would come to Panna for NMDC’s auction. “They used to take shallow mines on lease and also purchase the diamonds excavated. But this year, the excavation of diamonds from shallow mines decreased due to the poor availability of labourers. The footfall of businessmen also decreased.”Also Read | Cubs kill prey, learn to survive with tiger’s help in MP’s Panna reserveThe number of mining leases issued has reduced to 542 this year compared to 637 in 2020 during Covid-19 restrictions. As many as 711 leases were issued in 2019.Rampyare Vishwakarma, 45, a labourer, said after years three of them found a 14.4-carat diamond in February. “But we are waiting for the auction. We do not know when we will get money.”At least 300 labourers and qualified workers have lost jobs due to the closure of NMDC mine.The State Wildlife Board gave clearance to the NMDC mine in January this year. The Central Wildlife Board in March followed suit, but the matter is pending before a Supreme Court panel.The NMDC mining project began in 1959. It was shut down due to environmental issues in August 2005 before the mining resumed in June 2009 when the Supreme Court allowed it until 2020. An NMDC official said the complete excavation of diamonds will be completed by 2035.The Madhya Pradesh Forest Department is in favour of resuming the mining saying it would not affect wildlife in Panna. Panna Tiger Reserve filed director UK Sharma said they have already cleared the permission for mining by NMDC as there is no threat to wildlife due to its mine. “The movement of tigers and other animals are negligible in Manjhganwa.”State mining minister Brijendra Pratap Singh said the mining activity will be resumed soon. “We are also going to start a diamond museum in Khajuraho to boost the diamond business.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/diamond-excavation-plummets-in-madhya-pradesh-s-panna-101629960740972.html

This year marked the peace Nobel laureate’s 111th birth anniversary.On the occasion, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal reflected on the time he spent working with the founder of the Missionaries of Charity. “After working for Tata Steel, I volunteered at Mother Teresa's ashram in Kalighat. It was a spiritual experience that inspired me to be in service of humanity for life. On her birth anniversary, I join the millions whose lives she touched to remember her,” Kejriwal wrote on Thursday.After working for Tata Steel, I volunteered at Mother Teresa's ashram in Kalighat. It was a spiritual experience that inspired me to be in service of humanity for life. On her birth anniversary, I join the millions whose lives she touched to remember her.https://t.co/TKMRoQJQNpIn his tribute, Union minister Hardeep Puri said she dedicated her life to the service of humanity. "Remembering Bharat Ratna & Nobel Laureate Mother Teresa Ji on her birth anniversary. She established ‘Nirmal Hriday’ & dedicated her life to the service of humanity," the minister said on Twitter.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot too took to Twitter to commemorate the occasion. "Humble tributes to #MotherTeresa on her birth anniversary. Her life was dedicated to serving the poor, destitute and sick. Her compassion and selfless service for the welfare of mankind shall always remain an inspiration," Gehlot tweeted.Here’s more on the Catholic nun who worked tirelessly for the country’s poor.Teresa, baptised Gonxha Agnes, was born in Skopje, present day capital of Macedonia, to Nikola and Drana Bojaxhiu. She was the youngest child in a Kosovar Albanian family. Her father died when she was eight and her mother raised the children in his absence.A winner of multiple honours, including the Ramon Magsaysay Peace Prize, Teresa left home at the age of 18 to join the Sisters of Loreto at Loreto Abbey in Rathfarnham, Ireland, intent on joining the missionary. There she was given the name Sister Mary Teresa after St. Thérèse de Lisieux. She arrived in the then Calcutta in 1929 and was assigned to the Loreto Entally community where she taught at St. Mary’s School for girls, according to data available at the Mother Teresa of Calcutta centre.On September 10, 1946, during a train ride from Calcutta to Darjeeling for her annual retreat, Teresa received her “inspiration ,” her “call within a call”.“On that day, in a way she would never explain, Jesus’ thirst for love and for souls took hold of her heart and the desire to satiate His thirst became the driving force of her life,” the centre’s database read.Teresa answered the call in 1948 and began working with the poor. She also spent some time at the Medical Mission Sisters in Patna to receive basic medical training. In 1950, Teresa received permission from the Vatican for the diocesan congregation, which would later become the Missionaries of Charity. She envisioned that it would care for "the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone."She passed away on September 5, 1997, her feast day, and beatified on October 19, 2002. Despite certain controversies, Teresa was admired globally for her charitable work. She was accorded a state funeral by the government of India for her service to the poor irrespective of religion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mother-teresa-birth-anniversary-as-tributes-pour-in-here-s-more-on-the-saint-101629956167178.html
26-08-2021||India||Tension for 2nd consecutive day after Meghalaya cops and civilians enter Assam||There was fresh tension at a border point between Assam and Meghalaya on Wednesday after policemen and civilians from Meghalaya entered the Assam side.On Tuesday, a group of people from Meghalaya had allegedly damaged a police post at Umlapher area of Assam’s West Karbi Anglong district in retaliation against Assam police’s alleged misbehaviour with a Meghalaya resident at a border checkpoint on Monday night.“The situation had returned to normal on Tuesday after I had a talk with my counterpart in Ri Bhoi district of Meghalaya. But on Wednesday morning, some Meghalaya policemen accompanied by around 150 civilians entered Assam seeking a meeting on Tuesday’s incident,” said Ajagwran Basumatary, superintendent of police, West Karbi Anglong.“This led to civilians from Assam also gathering at the place. The situation was brought under control after our police and civilians managed to send the Meghalaya policemen and residents back,” he added.Basumatary said that tension flared up again after a few hours, when the deputy superintendent of police of Meghalaya’s Ri Bhoi district entered nearly 15 km inside Assam’s territory along with his security personnel, without any intimation to authorities in West Karbi Anglong district.“We had no information and [we] don’t know why he turned up after the situation was brought under control earlier in the day. The Meghalaya police vehicles were intercepted by civilians on the Assam side and there was some pushing and heckling between both groups,” said Basumatary.He said the police team from Meghalaya was finally escorted back to the interstate border by Assam Police personnel. “We have deployed some extra personnel at the site and the additional superintendent of police is present there,” he added.Ri-Bhoi additional district magistrate (ADM) MB Tongper said that the first group of policemen and Meghalaya residents, who entered Assam on Wednesday, meant to express solidarity with Assam residents but their visit was mistaken as intimidatory.“Since yesterday we had agreed on joint patrolling and hence the officer with his team was present, which probably raised tension as residents thought police were accompanying the visitors and it resulted in an altercation,” Tongper claimed that at least one Meghalaya cop was manhandled by someone in the crowd.The ADM accepted that while the intention of the visiting group was welcome, their timing was wrong, especially since no prior information was intimated to the Assam administration about this move.Ri-Bhoi deputy commissioner Rosetta M Kurbah said, “The incident could have been averted had people from our side not attempted to visit Umlapher on Wednesday. Luckily better sense prevailed.”Kurbah said she and her Karbi Anglong counterpart will meet on September 1. “Since Tuesday, we both have agreed to maintain the status quo and ensure no untoward incident takes place in our respective territories. The fact that my ADM reached the spot swiftly and contained the situation was because he was already on a tour of the area,” she said.Meghalaya was carved out of Assam in 1972, but both states have a long-pending boundary dispute, especially over 12 border points.Meghalaya doesn’t accept a 1951 Assam government notification which merged Block I and Block II of Jowai sub-division (which comprise 356 villages) with United Mikir and North Cachar Hills (now Karbi Anglong in Assam).In a bid to resolve the border dispute, chief ministers of both states held two rounds of meetings in July and August at Shillong and Guwahati where they agreed to sort the issue in a phased manner, focusing first on 6 of the 12 areas of contention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tension-for-2nd-consecutive-day-after-meghalaya-cops-and-civilians-enter-assam-101629956180324.html

This was a huge spike from the 37,593 infections the country registered a day ago. With the latest figures, the country’s coronavirus tally has now exceeded 32 million.The country had reported 25,467 new cases on Tuesday and 37,593 cases a day later. With today’s jump, the spike in cases has neared 20,000 in just two-days.There was a slight fall in the death tally with 607 patients losing their lives to the viral disease in the last 24 hours, taking the overall fatality to 4,36,365. As many as 648 deaths were recorded on Wednesday. As many as 34,159 people also recovered from the disease during the day, pushing the overall tally to 3,17,88,440.At present, active cases comprised 1.03 per cent of the total infections, while the nationwide recovery rate was recorded at 97.63 per cent, the ministry said.The southern state of Kerala contributed majorly to the spike with 31,445 new Covid-19 cases being registered on Wednesday, its highest single-day tally in three months. The test positivity rate (TPR) also soared to a three-month high of 19.03 per cent. Kerala too witnessed an individual spike in its daily tally as the state had recorded 24,296 cases on Tuesday. The latest onslaught is likely to have been brought by Onam celebrations from last week. Last year too, the state had witnessed a similar peak in the number of cases after celebrations had ended.Maharashtra too witnessed a spike in Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, breaching the 5,000-mark after a hiatus of five days. The state recorded 5,031cases after testing a total of 207,995 samples, and reported 213 Covid-related mortalities.Meanwhile, the country reached a major milestone of administering about 60.38 crore (60,38,46,475) doses of vaccine against the coronavirus as part of the nationwide drive launched earlier this year. Of these, 80,40,407 beneficiaries were inoculated in the last 24 hours. Since the vaccination was rolled out 603,846,475 beneficiaries have been inoculated, the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-reports-46-164-new-covid-19-cases-spike-of-over-20-000-infections-in-2-days-101629952107946.html

The country has seen the daily infection count spike, by over 20,000, and the reason for it is the resurgence of Covid-19 in some states, especially Kerala.According to health ministry data, Kerala alone accounts for over 68 per cent of India's caseload on Thursday. According to state health department, the southern state recorded 31,445 Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, the highest in three months. Ernakulam (with 4,048 cases) and Thrissur (with 3,865 cases) are the worst affected districts.The test positivity rate (TPR) in Kerala is 19.03%, also the highest in the last three months.The state government said that the reason for the spike is the festival of Onam, which was celebrated last week. “We expected a hike after Onam. A special drive is on to increase testing and vaccination. Since sero prevalence is very low in Kerala we have to find the infected and quarantine them at the earliest,” Kerala health minister Veena George said on Wednesday.Markets were jam-packed ahead of the festival; last year, too, the state saw a surge in cases after Onam.The fourth round of the sero survey conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research in July showed antibody prevalence was 67. 7% nationally but it was only 42.7 % in Kerala, meaning a huge chunk of its population is still susceptible to the virus. However, this theory is yet to be proven, and ICMR itself has said it does not make sense to disaggregate its overall sero-prevalence number across states.At a high-level meeting on Wednesday, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan cautioned the states regarding a spike/surge in Covid cases during the upcoming festival season and advised them to undertake all possible public health measures to curb this. He cited the example of Kerala.Another state which has been a cause of concern for the Centre is Maharashtra. The daily Covid-19 cases breached the 5,000 mark in Maharashtra - already the worst affected state - after a gap of five days on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-alone-accounts-for-over-68-of-india-s-new-covid-19-caseload-101629952174438.html

He added therefore most ethanol project proponents of Bihar are unable to avail benefit under the Centre’s interest subvention scheme nor are they able to get financing from banks.

He added due to the availability of raw materials and financial incentives of the state government, investors have shown an overwhelming interest and unprecedented proposals were received.Goyal assured him the ethanol produced in Bihar will be used for blending in diesel and jet fuel also. Regarding permitting Bihar to produce ethanol up to the availability of raw material, Goyal said the matter will be tabled at a Group of Ministers meeting.“He (Goyal) has assured that more and more ethanol units should be set up in Bihar, for this full help will be given from the center. Bihar has also got a positive response from the Union Minister on the demand of two hundred acres of two textile parks,” Hussain tweeted after meeting Goyal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-minister-seeks-subsidy-for-ethanol-units-101629948799352.html

26-08-2021||India||BJP leaders seek FIR against Uddhav Thackeray for remarks against Yogi Adityanath, file complaint||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders on Wednesday filed complaints against Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, his wife and 'Saamana' editor Rashmi Thackeray and Yuva Sena president Varun Sardesai, seeking FIRs against them. This came a day after Union minister and BJP leader Narayan Rane was arrested in Maharashtra over controversial remarks against Thackeray.All the three complaints have been filed in Nashik. The police confirmed that the BJP leaders submitted the three complaint applications, news agency PTI reported.The first complaint has been given by Rishikesh Jayant Aher against Thackeray and Sardesai. It accused Sardesai of staging an "illegal demonstration" outside Rane's Mumbai residence on Wednesday, and claimed that CM Thackeray later felicitated him at his official residence Varsha, which sent a "wrong message". Aher cited the videos of the protest broadcast on television channels and social media.He has demanded that Sardesai should be booked under sections 153(A), 107, 212 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the cyber crime laws.The second complaint has been lodged by Sunil Raghunath Kedar against Thackeray, saying had allegedly passed derogatory remarks against Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath.A video has emerged on social media from 2018, when Thackeray was not the chief minister, which shows the Shiv Sena chief as saying that Yogi should be "slapped with his chappal" for garlanding a photo of Shivaji wearing a footwear. The complainant said that Adityanath is not only the chief minister of UP and a BJP leader, but also the mahant of Gorakhpur Math and therefore the sentiments of many Hindus are attached to him.The third complaint has been lodged by Shivaji Nivrutti Barke against Rashmi Thackeray. It says that in the editorial published in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' on Wednesday, many abusive words were used against Rane, which was an "insult" of the constitutional post of Union minister that he holds.Rane was arrested on Tuesday afternoon from Maharashtra's Ratnagiri district for remarks made during the 'Jan Ashirwad Yatra' in Raigad a day before. Rane claimed that Thackeray forgot the year of India's independence during his August 15 address and that he would have slapped the chief minister for it. His comments had set off protests by Shiv Sainiks in many cities of Maharashtra.Rane was granted bail by a magistrate court late on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leaders-seek-fir-against-uddhav-thackeray-for-remarks-against-yogi-adityanath-file-complaint-101629944061182.html
26-08-2021||India||Rise of Taliban is internal security challenge for India||When Safdar Nagori, former president of banned Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), was arrested from Indore in March 2008, the radical Islamist told his interrogators that he regards Mullah Omar, then Emir-ul-Momeen of Taliban, the true Caliph of Muslim world.Nagori told his interrogators that his objective was to wage jihad in India under the leadership of Mullah Omar, who said to have died in Zabul in 2013. The SIMI radical said that he had great respect for then Al Qaeda Chief Osama bin Laden but could not consider him to be Caliph as he had been uprooted from his own soil or Saudi Arabia. Mullah Omar, on the other hand, waged jihad within his own country and on his own territory. Like Mullah Omar and the Taliban, Nagori was a Deobandi, which also draws inspiration from ultra-conservative Wahabi branch of Islam. Osama bin Laden was practitioner of Salafi Islam.While, according to Indian counter-terrorism experts, SIMI does not exist, but many its cadre have shifted to Wahadat-e-Islam in India. Despite Nagori’s desire to establish links with Mullah Omar through Gulf contacts, SIMI could not reach out to the Taliban chief cleric. It is also important to note that many SIMI’s cadre morphed into Indian Mujahideen, a Salafi terrorist organization trained by Lashkar-e-Taiba and promoted by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Jaish-e-Mohammed, the other Pakistan based outfit targeting India, is the umbilical brother of the Taliban like Haqqani Network or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on the Deobandi platform.Given the fact that Sunni radicals in India draw inspiration from the Sunni Pashtun group currently controlling Kabul, the rise of Taliban in Afghanistan, under the leadership of not to be seen Haibatullah Akhundzada, sends a clear message to all jihadists that practitioners of true Islam will finally emerge victorious, and this is the only way to Dar-ul-Islam.From the Indian perspective, rise of Taliban will not only pose an internal security challenge to the Modi government with large scale radicalisation as a first step, it will also embolden Pakistan based terrorist groups to attack India. Even though Deobandi and Salafi are separate schools, the Pakistani deep state has used Salafi groups like LeT to attack Indian embassy in Kabul in the past with the help of Deobandi Haqqani network. “ While Jaish and Lashkar cadres are not known to conduct joint operations against India, the ISI has ensured that they are launched from the same pads in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK). Similarly, Jaish has operated with the Taliban in Afghanistan but it was the ISI that forced Haqqani Network to help LeT cadre to attack Indian embassy and consulates in Jalalabad and Kandahar in the past. Lashkar on its own has limited influence in Kunar province of Afghanistan,” said a veteran Indian CT expert.With Pakistan being the mother lode of jihad, it is quite evident that the ISI will be the elephant in Taliban’s jihad control room in Afghanistan and will use the Sunni terrorist group for also settling personal scores in India and against its global adversaries. This will be the new global headache.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rise-of-taliban-is-internal-security-challenge-for-india-101629943366329.html

26-08-2021||India||India nears vax milestone: At least 1 jab to 50% adults||A little over seven months since the day India launched its Covid-19 vaccination drive on January 16, the mass inoculation programme is closing in on a major milestone, with nearly half the country’s adult population receiving at least one shot of the vaccine.On several fronts, the drive has seen progress – the pace of vaccination has picked up in recent weeks; India’s overall population coverage is now on par with the global average. But data shows that there is still a long way to go if India wants to achieve its stated target of vaccinating its entire adult population of 940 million by the end of 2021.Till Wednesday night, India has administered 602.4 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine to 465.7 million people with 329 million people partially vaccinated and 126.7 million people having received both doses of the vaccine. When seen alongside the country’s projected adult population of 940 million (according to the Census of India’s National Commission on Population), this means that 49.5% of people above the age of 18 years have received vaccine shots – 35% have been partially vaccinated and 14.5% having received both doses.The proportion is likely to cross the 50% mark as early as Thursday.The headline number on population coverage, however, glosses over the wide variations in different states.While Himachal Pradesh is the standout in terms of administering doses to the largest proportion of its adults (97% with at least one shot), it is followed by Uttarakhand (75.3% adults vaccinated with at least one shot) and Kerala (74.2%). Delhi, with 60.4% of estimated adult population having received at least one dose of the vaccine, lies above the national average. At the other end, several high population states such as West Bengal (37.3%), Uttar Pradesh (37.6%), and Bihar (38%) trail far behind the pack.The milestone comes at a time when the country’s rate of vaccination, which has been patchy at best, has finally settled into high gear. In the past week, an average of 5.2 million doses has been administered across the country every day. While this number is still slightly off peak levels seen in the week ended June 26 when the rate of vaccination touched 6.4 million a day, it has hovered within the 4.9 million-5.5 million range almost throughout August – a significant improvement for the drive which had consistently remained in sub-2 million levels through most of May.Data shows that the country needs to double the current pace of vaccinations till the end of the year to completely vaccinate all adults by the end of December, a commitment the government has made in a submission to the Supreme Court. In total, India needed to administer around 1.88 billion doses by the end of the year to meet this target. Since 602 million of these have already been administered, that leaves 1.28 billion doses still left in the remaining 128 days in the year, or 10 million doses a day – a feat that has not been achieved on even a single day so far.Government officials are confident that the pace of vaccinations will accelerate.“September is a crucial month as things will improve further because of availability of more vaccine doses. We are capable of administering many more vaccine doses in a single day (at least 10 million); and it will happen soon,” said NK Arora, chairman, National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation said on Wednesday.In absolute numbers, India is second only to China (with 1.98 billion doses administered) in terms of total shots given in a country, but it lags several others in terms of total proportion of people vaccinated – only 33% of the country’s total population (including those under 18) have been vaccinated with at least one dose. This figure is on par with the global average, according to data collated by Our World in Data. However, much of the western world has covered nearly twice their proportion of population. The US, for instance, has administered 364 million shots as of Tuesday night (it is in the third spot in overall doses given), thus covering around 60% of its population. Portugal has covered 82% of its population, Spain 77%, Canada 73% and the United Kingdom 70%.An HT analysis done on August 4 showed that while the Delta variant of Covid-19, a highly contagious variant of Sars-CoV-2, has led to a massive surge in infections nearly across the world, nations that have high vaccination rates have managed to keep their deaths far lower than in previous waves, while nations in Asia and Africa with low vaccination coverage are struggling to do the same.This, experts said, is a crucial factor for improving India’s coverage. Should a possible third wave of Covid-19 hit the country, mass vaccination may give large swathes of the population protection from hospitalisation, severe disease, and if things go south, death.“It’s a very pertinent milestone for the country to cross in our battle against Covid-19. It is equally important that the people of this country get not one, but both doses as quickly as possible because we do not know if or when the third wave can hit us. Mass vaccination is perhaps one of the most important and long-lasting measure we can take that can delay or reduce the impact of a possible third wave,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology at ICMR.“But vaccination can’t be the only measure... We still need to wear masks, avoid crowded areas even after being fully vaccinated. This is because new mutations can always take place that can even evade the immunity produced by vaccines. This is where the role of local government comes into play – they need to constantly screen positive results for new variants. Whenever we record new mutations we need to be able to correlate it with the epidemiological picture so we can stay ahead of the virus,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-nears-vax-milestone-at-least-1-jab-to-50-adults-101629931441811.html
26-08-2021||India||Three key medium-term questions on the economy||GDP numbers for the first quarter of 2021-22 will be released on August 31. In its latest resolution, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India projected 21.4% growth in the quarter. This will not make up for the 24.4% contraction in the same period last year. Other forecasters, such as State Bank of India’s chief economist have projected lower growth rates. The only reason these numbers have not set alarm bells ringing is because the June quarter saw a big disruption due to the second wave of Covid-19 infections. There is a view, especially within the government, about the inevitability of economic activity gathering momentum going forward. The biggest proof of this is the government’s roll-out of National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) for the next four years (from 2021-22 to 2024-25) this week. NMP is basically an exercise in leasing public assets to private players at a pre-determined price. The government expects to raise ₹6 lakh crore from this exercise over the period. Any such exercise only makes sense if the government can convince bidders that the economy will do well in the future. It is for this reason that the estimated proceeds have been qualified in the press release announcing the NMP. “The monetisation value that is expected to be realised by the public asset owner through the asset monetisation process, may either be in form of upfront accruals or by way of private sector investment. The potential value assessed under NMP is only an indicative high-level estimate based on thumb rules”, the release said. But what is the real state of the macro economy?Also Read | National Monetisation Pipeline: What is it and how will it benefit the country?1) The question of financeThe press release issued on the roll-out of NMP has left the modalities of the implementation very broad based. “The assets and transactions identified under NMP are expected to be rolled out through a range of instruments. These include direct contractual instruments such as public private partnership concessions and capital market instruments such as Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvIT) among others.” One question that emerges is the method of financing such a monetisation programme. It is reasonable to assume that domestic capital will be a significant player in this exercise and private debt will be an important instrument. The sum involved is bound to have a significant impact on the debt market for infrastructure. RBI data available in the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) database shows that the total outstanding credit to infrastructure sector was ?10.9 lakh crore at the end of 2020-21. So, the expected NMP proceeds are almost 60% of total outstanding credit to infrastructure. This highlights the credit market churn which NMP will unleash, even more so, when it is read along with an ambitious target for private investment under the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP). These numbers also underline the risk to the financial system any exuberance in valuation of the assets being monetised can bring, via future bad loans.2) How important are capital market driven wealth effect tailwinds for formal sector engine of the economy?Anybody who invested a significant sum when the stock markets crashed in March 2020 would have almost doubled it today. The ongoing stock market rally is bound to have generated a significant amount of positive wealth effect in the economy, especially among the classes and institutions which matter when it comes to big ticket investments. A look at the PE multiple – the ratio of price of a share and earnings per share – of the benchmark BSE Sensex shows that the stock market is more overvalued than it was before the pandemic. The persistence of a loose monetary environment has also encouraged another route to making stock market windfalls, where both institutional and high net worth individual players have exploited low interest rates to borrow money and invest in IPOs just to make listing day gains. The problem with such capital gains avenues is that they are not self-sustaining. As expectations of monetary tightening, both in India and abroad, increase, capital flight to advanced countries and profit booking endeavours might lead to a significant correction. Any such development is bound to create a significant negative wealth effect. While financial market exposure is not as high in India as it was in the US during the 2008 crisis, any significant correction will have a not insignificant effect on business sentiment. And corporate profits did not suffer significantly during the pandemic, ruling out the possibility of a large rebound as things improve. This reduces the likelihood of significant tailwinds to capital markets.3) Will inflation put a squeeze on future growth?Since December 2019 the Consumer Price Index has grown above RBI’s target of 4% every quarter. In the minutes of the latest MPC meeting, members warned against the practice of treating the upper band of 6% as the inflation target instead of the actual monetary target. RBI continues to maintain that the current phase of high inflation should be seen as transient and supply-side driven and monetary policy should do all it can do boost aggregate demand. Such an approach amounts to kicking the proverbial can of ”what will happen to already high inflation when aggregate demand picks up” down the road. The government has ruled out the possibility of providing any significant relief in petroleum prices. This is a direct fallout of the precarious fiscal situation. This will create a cascading effect on inflation. As the 2024 elections near, the government will have to consider bigger hikes in Minimum Support Prices, which have grown at a lower rate than retail inflation. Many experts expect a spike in services inflation, once vaccinations cross a critical threshold and demand picks up. Persisting high inflation can adversely affect growth via two routes. It can spook foreign capital , leading to exchange rate depreciation, adversely affecting India’s trade balance in energy (every barrel of oil will cost more in rupee terms). There is also the danger of high prices putting a squeeze on un-indexed earnings of informal sector workers, which will weaken aggregate demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-key-medium-term-questions-on-the-economy-101629928713087.html
26-08-2021||India||K’taka govt aims to double farmers’ income: CM||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday said that the state government will form two committees and a second directorate for agriculture to supplement efforts in fulfilling Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of doubling farmers’ income. The Karnataka government has set itself a deadline between 2023-24 to achieve this feat by implementing the new changes and schemes. “Karnataka is taking a lot of interest in this and wants to be the first to achieve doubling farmers’ income,” Bommai said. He added that the state will set up two committees, one involving farmers, and the other with the help of agricultural universities to help implement the programmes. A team, led by Ashok Dalwai, chief executive of the National Rainfed Area Authority (NRAA), and an empowered body of the DFI (doubling farmers’ income), and others from the Union ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare met CM Bommai and other cabinet ministers of the state and made a presentation on the Centre’s strategy for doubling farmers income. The developments come even as farmers in the state have been struggling with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and extreme weather conditions, oscillating between droughts and floods, plummeting prices of the products and other factors that have adversely affected the income of the agricultural community in the state and other parts of the country. Bommai said that a second directorate involving sericulture, horticulture, agriculture, fisheries, dairy and animal husbandry among others would be formed to aid efforts. The secondary directorate would help in the marketing and sale of agro-based products and value additions, he said. On Wednesday, Bommai met agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar in New Delhi, where the Karnataka chief minister arrived this afternoon. The Prime Minister’s grand DFI schemes have come under sharp criticism as the farmers in north India and several parts of Karnataka continue to oppose the contentious farm laws. In Karnataka, farmers are yet to receive relief for floods, droughts or damaged property from the government, according to the farmer leaders and political opposition. Kodihalli Chandrashekar, the president of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, on Wednesday, said that he will be travelling to all parts of the state to discuss and understand the problems of farmers and convey them to the government. “If the government fails, we will come to the streets to protest,” he said. Chandrashekar said that he asked the chief minister to speak to farmers on the issue, but the latter appears to be only in some celebratory mood since taking over the top job.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-govt-aims-to-double-farmers-income-cm-101629921855155.html
26-08-2021||India||Mahadayi dispute should be resolved politically: K’taka congress leader||The ongoing Mahadayi interstate water dispute involving Goa and Karnataka should be resolved politically rather than in courts, said Prakash Rathod, Congress leader and member of the Karnataka Legislative Council in Goa on Wednesday. Rathod, who has been appointed one of the AICC observers for the upcoming polls in Goa, when asked about the party’s stance on the dispute, said, “As far as the Mahadayi issue is concerned, first and foremost there is a BJP government at the Centre, Karnataka and Goa. If the PM wants a solution; it can be found within two minutes. But he does not have the will to do it. They only want to make Goa and Karnataka fight.”“The case is currently being fought in the Tribunal and the Supreme Court. I want that a political decision should be made by making the Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka governments sit together. The Modi government at the Centre has failed to redress this issue,” he added.Goa has opposed any diversion of waters of the River Mahadayi which originates in the Western Ghats in Karnataka, takes a detour via Maharashtra and enters Goa as the Mandovi. The Mahadayi river basin drains comprises an area of 2,032 sq.km., out of which an area of 375 sq.km. lies in Karnataka, 77 sq.km. in Maharashtra and rest in Goa.Both the Goa and Karnataka governments have, for very different reasons, challenged the final award granted by the Mahadayi Interstate Water Disputes Tribunal which in a verdict in August 2018 granted Karnataka a total of 13.42 thousand million cubic feet (tmc) of water out of their demand for 36.558 tmc of water.While Goa has approached the Supreme Court arguing that Karnataka shouldn’t be allowed to divert any water owing to the fact that the Mahadayi river is a water deficient river, Karnataka is before the Supreme Court argued that the tribunal erred by granting it only 13.42 tmc of water.Past efforts at holding ‘talks’ between the two states have failed because Goa and Karnataka hold irreconcilable positions on the issue given Goa’s stance that no water should be diverted outside the basin while Karnataka believes that it can ‘negotiate’ the quantum of water they should be allowed to divert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mahadayi-dispute-should-be-resolved-politically-k-taka-congress-leader-101629921794230.html
26-08-2021||India||Smugglers now taking the ‘innovative’ route||Bengaluru: On August 17, the officials of the Directorate Revenue Intelligence (DRI) were waiting for a passenger, who had boarded a connecting flight from Dubai, to land at the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA). The African national who claimed he had come to India for treatment of kidney ailment, was pulled aside for checking on arrival. After the baggage didn’t show anything, the officials took him for a medical scan. According to the DRI officials, they had received a specific input that he had drugs in his stomach, and the tip was proven right during the scan. “He had consumed 1.3 kg of cocaine worth around ₹12 crore. The cocaine was consumed as small capsules. They were double packed in condoms and he swallowed them,” said a senior DRI official. This is among the many bizarre and creative ways used to smuggle contraband through Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport in the recent past. Despite the pandemic and restrictions on travel that followed, there have been several attempts to smuggle contraband, said officials at the airport. From seizing gold, drugs, and raw materials for drug manufacturing, the customs department at the airport has been busy over the past year. Not only that, attempt has also been made to send out contraband from the airport.An official spokesperson of the customs department said that a particular incident involving gold smuggling was busted in March when two passengers were caught smuggling gold in the form of screws and rods of trolly bags. The first instance was reported on March 3, when the Customs Department officials searched a bag of a passenger based on a tipoff. The trolley bag was fitted with 42 screws and four rods, which were made of gold and coated with rhodium to camouflage the gold. The 42-year-old passenger, a resident of Karwar was subsequently arrested. Just a day after, another person was caught smuggling gold using the same operandi. In this case, the 30-year-old passenger’s laptop bag had a strip of gold and had 23 gold screws fitted to it, which were covered in copper to avoid detection.In another case reported on June 2, a 35-year-old Zimbabwean woman was carrying 8 kg of heroin worth ₹56 crore, which she had hidden in a false bottom of her bag. “In both cases where drugs were seized, the common factor was that the two arrested persons entered the country on a medical visa. We have passed the information on to the concerned authorities for further action,” the DRI official added. It was not just passengers and cargo coming into the country, but even the consignment leaving the country have come under the customs department’s radar. According to an official, two instances of smuggling drugs using photo albums and wedding cards stood out in 2020. “The first incident was reported in February 2020. In this case, the 5 kilograms of ephedrine worth around ₹5 crore was found inside several wedding invitations. The drug was hidden between gaps of 43 wedding cards, packed in plastic covers. Each wedding card had two of such packets,” said the DRI official. By August, a similar incident was reported in which 13.2 kg of pseudoephedrine worth around ₹13 crore was seized at the Kempegowda International Airport. On August 17, 2020, a tipoff was received by the department officials claimed that a large quantity of pseudoephedrine was en route to Australia from Bengaluru. “The consignment was in Singapore when we got the tipoff, so we recalled it. On checking it, we found photo albums, phone frames, and other personal items. It looked liked memorabilia of a private event being sent to relatives in Australia, but each item had drugs in it,” said the DRI official. Drugs were hidden in the thick covers of the albums and photo frames. Thin sheets of pseudoephedrine were kept under the photographs in the albums and similarly in the photo frames. “This is one of the largest consignments seized in recent times at the international airport. The market value of this product was more than ₹13 crore,” said the DRI official. According to a statement from a DRI spokesperson, pseudoephedrine is becoming the main precursor chemical preferred in the manufacture of methamphetamine in Australia. Only 1.5 kg of pseudoephedrine is needed to obtain one kg of methamphetamine.This incident brought out the supply of raw materials to produce drugs to Australia and other countries, over the past five years. “Despite the pandemic, the total amount of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine seized by the DRI across India this year has already crossed 500 kg, clearly pointing to a mass diversion of the precursor drug to Australian markets,” read the statement. Crystalline methamphetamine, sold as crystal meth or ice, is manufactured in clandestine drug laboratories in Australia and is a highly purified form of the drug that is recognizable by its translucent crystalline appearance. “In recent times, there has been an ever-increasing number of cases that have been detected by enforcement agencies of attempted smuggling from India to Australia of both ephedrine and pseudoephedrine,” said the DRI KIA officials said that with the travel restrictions easing, they are looking at more attempts to smuggle contraband from using more innovating methods and the customs department is strengthening its vigilance and informant networks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/smugglers-now-taking-the-innovative-route-101629921675205.html
26-08-2021||India||In a first, BJP bags Mysuru local seat after Cong-JD(S) talks fail||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday managed to wrest control of the Mysuru city corporation for the first time in its history after talks between the Janata Dal (Secular) and Congress collapsed at the last moment. With this, BJP’s corporator Sunanda Palanethra became the mayor of the heritage city.According to people aware of the developments, the Congress and JD(S) were holding talks till just 15 minutes before the elections. But the two parties were not able to find a middle ground, costing them the control over the city administration. The Congress stormed out of the council hall, sloganeering against the JD(S) after negotiations and a fragile alliance between the two fell apart. “Until 11.45 am we were talking to the JD(S) and the elections were at 12 pm,” R Dhruvanarayana, a Congress leader and former member of Parliament from Chamarajanagar, told Hindustan Times. The BJP has 25 votes that includes 22 corporators, one MLA and one MP while the JD(S) had 21 votes which includes 17 corporators, one MLA and three MLCs. The Congress has 21 votes that includes one MLA. Former chief minister BS Yediyurappa in a tweet on Wednesday congratulated Palanetra for being elected as the Mayor of Mysuru. “The BJP was able to get the Mayor’s post for the first time and it is an indication that the party’s roots are widening. Hearty congratulations to Sunanda Palanetra, who has been elected as the Mayor of Mysuru,” Yediyurappa tweeted. The developments come at a time when the BJP is looking to expand its footprint in the Old Mysuru region or south interior Karnataka belt, where it has little or no presence and is key for its ambitions to return to power with a full majority on its own in the 2023 assembly elections. This region, however, is considered a stronghold of the JD(S) and the Congress. Despite the friction and turbulent past, the two bitter rivals decided to come together in 2018 and continued its alliance to keep the BJP out of the district administration, much like how they did after the fractured verdict in the previous assembly polls. The elections were important for all three parties in their own way. For the BJP, it was to make inroads in a region where it has no presence while the JD(S) is trying to stop the juggernaut of the saffron outfit in the one geography that gives it all its strength and faces an existential crisis if it does not stop the former from surging ahead. For the Congress, which believes the JD(S) and BJP are in an informal alliance, it is to win back as much ground as possible before the 2023 elections if it does have any hopes of ousting the BJP. ST Somashekar, a cabinet minister and in-charge of Mysuru district said that the JD(S) had met the BJP this year as well and requested that the party to support the regional outfit for the post of Mayor. Srikante Gowda, the MLC of the JD(S) said that there was just four months remaining in the Mayor’s term and that they had asked the Congress to allow the former to take control and the favour would be reciprocated next term. There are two more years of the corporation before it heads to the polls again. Dhruvanarayana, however, said that there has been an “informal alliance’ between the JD(S) and the BJP. This holds true in most other elections in Karnataka where the JD(S) and BJP have helped each other against the Congress, whom both consider a common enemy. The JD(S), headed by former prime minister HD Deve Gowda and his former chief minister son HD Kumaraswamy, are the only major outfit to have allied with both the Congress and BJP in the past, allowing them to play “kingmaker” on more than one occasion. However, Dhruvanarayana said that the BJP is unlikely to benefit from the Mysuru city corporation elections as it has no presence on the ground. Dhruvanarayana, considered a top performer formidable candidate in neighbouring Chamarajanagar, was ousted by V Srinivas Prasad of the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, giving the saffron outfit an unprecedented 25 out of the total 28 seats in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-bjp-bags-mysuru-local-seat-after-cong-jd-s-talks-fail-101629921555726.html
26-08-2021||India||Row intensifies after 5 teachers consume poison during protest in Bengal||Kolkata: I have been transferred from Bakkhali to Cooch Behar. We cannot live like this. The government has pushed us to this point,” a temporary teaching assistant at a Sishu Siksha Kendra (SSK) in West Bengal’s South 24 Parganas district had said, according to her colleagues, before drinking pesticide during an agitation on Tuesday. She was among the five teachers who consumed poison from small bottles they were carrying on Tuesday, as part of a protest outside Bikash Bhawan, the secretariat of the state school department at Salt Lake in Kolkata’s eastern district. For her, the transfer meant relocating to a place 746 km away, a distance which, according to Google maps, takes around 18 hours to cover by car. “Transfer orders, that had asked her and four other teachers working on contract for SSKs and Madhyamik Siksha Kendras (MSK) to report for duty in districts hundreds of miles away from their homes, led to the mass suicide bid,” said Maidul Islam, general secretary of the Paschimbanga Sikshak Aikya Mukta Mancha, which has demanded permanent placement and revocation of the transfer orders. SSK and MSK teaching assistants working on contractual basis are usually posted in schools that are not too far from their homes, Islam said, adding, “None of us knew that the five women were carrying poison. What they did was not right.” Run by the panchayat and rural development department, SSKs and MSKs are schools where teaching assistants used to be paid ₹5,400 per month till the state government revised the salary to ₹10,340 in October last year, following a long agitation. “Along with the revised pay came transfer orders for some of those who were part of the movement,” Islam said. The Mancha earlier moved court and held protests outside the residence of education minister Bratya Basu. All five teachers are now under observation at critical care units in the state-run RG Kar Hospital and NRS Hospital in Kolkata. Another teacher from Jiaganj in Murshidabad district has been transferred to the Mal community block in Jalpaiguri. The 409-km distance entails an almost 11-hour road trip via NH-12. “What’s more, he has been transferred to a Hindi-medium SSK. Similarly, another teacher, a tribal woman teaching at an SSK at Salboni in West Midnapore district, has been transferred to a Hindi-medium school at Dhupguri in Jalpaiguri district,” said one of the agitators, who did not want to be named fearing disciplinary action. A teacher from Mahishadal in East Midnapore has been asked to go to Harirampur in South Dinajpur district while another one from Balagarh in Hooghly district has to report to a Madrasah in Malda district, 314 km away. Both attempted suicide. The incident, being the first of its kind in Bengal, has triggered a slugfest between the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which won 77 seats in the March-April assembly polls. “During the Left Front regime, teaching assistants at SSKs and MSKs used to get a token honorarium. They had no job security and post-retirement benefit. The government has now introduced provident fund scheme for those who opt to retire at 60. Women get maternity leave and all are entitled to healthcare benefits and 18 casual leaves a year. Those who are agitating even after getting all these must be BJP cadres,” education minister Bratya Basu tweeted on Wednesday afternoon. BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu visited NRS Hospital to check on the teachers during the day. “Even if a TMC worker’s home is damaged by a falling tree the ruling party will accuse the BJP. The accusation does not surprise us. We don’t support this suicide attempt. It cannot be a mode of protest. The education minister should spend more time meeting teachers and hearing out their problems instead of visiting Tripura. He should resign after what has happened,” said Basu. “The Mancha is not affiliated to any political party,” said Islam.Doctors at both hospitals said the women were in stable condition but could not be declared out of danger before 72 hours. They showed symptoms triggered by organophosphorus compounds used in pesticides. Deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division) Priyabrata Roy said, “Police personnel tried their best to stop the agitators from taking poison. We hope they get well soon.” If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.

There are also concerns about possible suicide attacks on the airport and the crowds there by the Islamic State-Khorasan, with US President Joe Biden personally acknowledging the threat.An Indian military aircraft was set to fly out up to 180 people late on Wednesday night, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The group is expected to reach India on Thursday.As with recent evacuation efforts, Afghan citizens given Indian visas have had problems in accessing Kabul airport because of strict checks being conducted by Taliban fighters on all routes.Given the difficulties associated with organising evacuation flights ahead of the August 31 deadline for the US withdrawal, Indian officials have focused on ensuring that no Indian nationals are left behind, the people added. The US and its allies have evacuated more than 80,000 people, including their nationals, NATO personnel and Afghans at risk, since August 14, the day before the Taliban marched into Kabul after the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government. Biden has spurned calls from G7 leaders to keep American troops at the airport beyond the deadline, which was set under an agreement signed by the previous Donald Trump administration with the Taliban in February last year. Officials of G7 states have said no country will be able to evacuate all their citizens and at-risk Afghans by August 31. Tens of thousands of Afghans have thronged Kabul airport over the past week but most of them have been unable to secure seats on evacuation flights. The Pentagon said on Wednesday that military flights from Kabul will continue until the final hours of the August 31 deadline, though there will be a balance in getting out evacuees and 5,400 American troops and their equipment in the final days and hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-military-aircraft-set-to-fly-out-180-from-afghanistan-tonight-101629921374794.html

26-08-2021||India||Day before Jaishankar’s address, Oppn prepares for govt’s Afghan briefing||The Congress on Wednesday held a high-level internal meeting where it consulted two former diplomats on the Afghanistan situation, a day before the Union government’s briefing on the issue. Other Opposition parties, too, were busy preparing background notes or holding discussions on the latest developments related to the Taliban’s grip on war-torn Afghanistan, people aware of the developments said.Former national security adviser Shivshankar Menon and former foreign secretary Shyam Saran joined the Congress’s discussions on the Afghanistan situation on Wednesday. The virtual meeting chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi was also attended by former prime minister Manmohan Singh, party leaders Rahul Gandhi, leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, Anand Sharma and Congress’s Lok Sabha leader Adhir Chowdhury, among others.Also Read | Ready for overflow of Afghanistan terror to India: CDSExternal affairs minister S Jaishankar will brief parliamentary floor leaders of various parties on the prevailing situation in Afghanistan at 11 am on Thursday after the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan fuelled chaos, protests and exodus from Kabul.The Congress’s meeting went on for an hour and the party discussed 10 broad points ranging from the role of the Northern alliance to evacuation efforts to the stand against Taliban. Later, the party decided to restructure the 10 broad points into four-five specific issues on which the party leaders would seek the government’s reply.HT’s request for comments to both Menon and Saran went unanswered.The Trinamool Congress (TMC) has prepared a note based on inputs of former external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha, who joined the West Bengal’s ruling party earlier this year. TMC MP Derek O’Brien said, “We want to hear the government first. Our response should be based on what the government tells us at the meeting.” The party’s background note, accessed by HT, suggests the government should talk “openly and transparently” with Taliban and must extract assurance “that their land will not be used (to nurture terrorist groups and provide training to these outfits) to Indian delegations if there is a one-on-one meeting.”The TMC’s note also suggests, “India should immediately open its embassy in Kabul and send back the ambassador. We must remember that the people of Afghanistan have great love for India. Pakistan is not popular with the people of Afghanistan.”Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury held an internal briefing of the party on Wednesday. The party is likely to criticise the US, a usual policy for the communists, but ask the government on the security and strategy issues. “We are deeply concerned about the developments on Afghan soil,” said Yechury.The last all-party meeting on Afghanistan was held 20 years ago, on October 30, 2001, after US forces launched an attack against the Taliban in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror strike. The upcoming meeting, organised by the parliamentary affairs ministry, underlines how history has turned a full circle on Afghan soil.Both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha leaders of various parties have been invited for the meeting, which will see Jaishankar briefing the parties before answering their questions. It will be the first all-party parliamentary meeting on an external situation during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s tenure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-before-jaishankar-s-address-oppn-prepares-for-govt-s-afghan-briefing-101629920715756.html
26-08-2021||India||High court cancels FIR against Jammu journalist, says is attack on press freedom||Jammu: The Jammu and Kashmir high court on Tuesday cancelled a First Information Report (FIR) registered against a local journalist for a news report on alleged custodial torture of a man in 2018, ruling that the police decision to file charges against the journalist “is undoubtedly an attack on the freedom of press”. “No fetters can be placed on the freedom of press by registering the FIR against a reporter, who was performing his professional duty by publishing a news item on the basis of information obtained by him from an identifiable source,” justice Rajnesh Oswal said in his ruling delivered on Tuesday. The verdict was uploaded on the high court’s website on Wednesday.In his April 2018 report published in a local daily Early Times, journalist Asif Iqbal Naik extensively quoted the family members of a Kishtwar resident Akhter Hussain who alleged that he was torture. The police claimed that the news report was factually incorrect and filed an FIR against the journalist, accusing him of trying to instigate the people of Kishtwar against the police by “creating a rage/confusion among the public”. It also accused the journalist of provoking people to vandalism.The FIR accused Naik of offences under sections 500 (defamation), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 505 (statement conducting to public mischief) of the Ranbir Penal Code (RPC).The judge said, “the mere fact that FIR was lodged only against the journalist and not against the person, who has disclosed the said incident to the journalist prima facie establishes malice on the part of the respondents.” It also noted that the reported allegations were repeated by the man’s family in complaints to the police.“The mode and manner in which the impugned FIR has been lodged clearly reflects the mala fide on the part of respondents as the respondents could have given their version by similar mode but they chose unique method of silencing the petitioner and it is undoubtedly an attack on the freedom of press,” the judge said in his 14-page verdict.The court said the police, which disputed the facts, should have given its version to the newspaper contesting the allegations.Naik said the high court came to his rescue in 2018 as well when the Kishtwar administration barred him from entering the district magistrate’s office complex for the second time after reports that he said, “exposed the corrupt practices of the officials” there.He said the FIR was registered against him because he sought action against the officer who misused his power. “The case is a classic example of settling personal grudges by a senior police official (through use of his power),” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-court-cancels-fir-against-jammu-journalist-says-is-attack-on-press-freedom-101629920234603.html

These school children from Gharuri village of Bangapani sub-division have no other choice but to use a makeshift trolley hung on the rope to cross river Gori, after the under-construction bridge was washed away in last year’s flash-floods. “After schools were reopened earlier this month, our children have to go to school on a daily basis. The schools are situated in Bangapani and Baram towns across the swollen river. They use this temporary trolley hung on a rope to reach their schools. We know this is very dangerous but we have no other option,” said Harish Singh, a resident of Gharuri village. Singh said after the under-construction bridge and permanent trolley over the river were washed away by floods last year, the students had to use this temporary trolley made by villagers over the river. “This makeshift trolley is not safe. We remain worried about the children till they return from school every day,” said Ganesh Singh, another villager. Dharchula MLA, Harish Dhami said he had for long been demanding the construction of a permanent bridge at Gharuri, as it would ensure that the children in the area don’t have to risk their lives by crossing the river in such a dangerous way. “The state government should take this matter seriously as otherwise, some untoward incident will take place,” said Dhami. Vineeta, a class 9 student, who studies at a school in Bangapani, said they want to go to school and as such, they have to take the risk of crossing the river. “The other option is crossing the river by wading through it, which is more dangerous. So, we are using this temporary trolley on the rope to cross it,” she said. When contacted, District Magistrate Pithoragarh Ashish Chauhan said he has been apprised of the seriousness of the situation in the area. “I have ordered PRD (Prantiya Rakshi Dal) jawans to keep guard at both ends of the temporary trolley for the safety of the students. We are also considering arranging classes for students in their respective villages till the bridge or permanent trolley is constructed over the river,” said Chauhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kids-in-pithoragarh-risk-their-lives-cross-a-swollen-river-to-reach-school-101629920054532.html
26-08-2021||India||E-visa mandatory for all Afghans||The Union government on Wednesday cancelled with immediate effect all previously issued visas to Afghan nationals who are currently not in India, and announced that they can now travel to the country only on an electronic visa or e-visa.A government order said that the introduction of the “e-Emergency X-Misc visa” last week has streamlined the visa process, and officials aware of the matter pointed out that the decision was taken after intelligence agencies received reports that several Afghan nationals issued physical visas misplaced their passports, suggesting that they may either not be able to use the visas, or that the visas could be misused.The Indian embassy and all consulates in Afghanistan were closed in the last two months.“Owing to the prevailing security situation in Afghanistan and streamlining of the visa process by introduction of the ‘e-Emergency X-Misc visa’, it has been decided that all Afghan nationals henceforth must travel to India only on e-Visa,” a home ministry spokesperson said.“Keeping in view some reports that certain passports of Afghan nationals have been misplaced, previously issued visas to all Afghan nationals, who are presently not in India, stand invalidated with immediate effect. Afghan nationals wishing to travel to India may apply for e-Visa at www.indianvisaonline.gov.in,” the spokesperson added.As HT reported on Wednesday, intelligence agencies have alerted the government that some unidentified Urdu-speaking men forced their way into an office in Kabul dealing with visa distribution on behalf of the Indian missions there, and seized and unknown number of Afghan passports with stamped visas.The incident took place on August 15, the day Taliban captured Kabul.People familiar with the matter said that Indian agencies suspected the men who seized Afghan passports stamped with Indian visas had links with Pakistan, and the passports could be used for anti-India activities.Those who have lost their passports in Afghanistan and wish to travel to India will now have to get a new passport in Kabul, and then apply for an Indian e-visa, said one of the people. He added the e-visa applications will be examined and processed in New Delhi.The “e-Emergency X-Misc visa” will initially be valid for six months, and all Afghans, irrespective of their religion, can apply for it.Afghanistan nationals were so far not eligible for e-visas for India because the country came under the Prior Reference Category (PRC) for grant of visa. Under PRC, people travelling to India have to be cleared by home ministry first. People covered under PRC include nationals from Pakistan, Iraq and Sudan, foreigners of Pakistani origin, and stateless persons. China is in the PRC category only for employment visas.India has so far evacuated 800 people from Kabul, including its embassy staff, Indians who lived there, several Afghans, including two members of parliament, and Hindus and Sikhs who faced threats from the Taliban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/evisa-mandatory-for-all-afghans-101629919815113.html
26-08-2021||India||Online gambling threat, can’t make profit at the cost of young lives: Delhi HC||The Delhi high court on Wednesday observed that online gambling is “dangerous” and portals cannot be allowed to make money at the cost of youngsters’ lives.Agreeing to examine a plea seeking regulation of such portals, a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh told the All India Gaming Federation: “We don’t want to join you as a party. Enough is enough. You just wait and watch..You are more concerned with your game and earning your money. But people are losing their money. Youngsters are committing suicide..You are concerned about earning at the cost of the lives of others. This cannot be at the cost of the life of youngsters..It (online gambling) is dangerous.”The bench’s observations came as it refused to hear the federation in connection with the petition filed by one advocate and chartered accountant, Avinash Mehrotra, who contended that gambling, i.e. wagering on games of chance, was illegal as per the law and most state legislations had also forbidden the same.Despite the presence of various provisions under the law, a large number of websites providing gambling, betting and wagering games continued to be accessible in the country, the petitioner said.Also Read | What’s the legal status of gambling regulations in India in 2021?This plea also sought quashing of an order by the Centre last October, where it stated that it does not have the competence to block gambling and betting websites in India. On December 14, the court had issued a notice to the Union government on the plea and sought to know their stand.In its response in an affidavit filed through standing counsel Anil Soni, the Centre said that framing laws and regulating online gaming platforms was a “state subject”. “Since gaming/gambling are state subjects, States are the appropriate governments to issue notice to the intermediaries to block access to any gambling websites. Thus the respondent no. 1 (MEITY) is not authorised to direct any intermediary to block any online gaming or gambling websites,” the affidavit said.“It is submitted that as per the Allocation of Business Rules 1961, ‘Games or Gambling’ do not fall under the functional mandate of MeitY (ministry of electronics and information technology). MeitY is not the ‘appropriate government’ to regulate such online games. States being the ‘appropriate government’ have already enacted laws to regulate games/gambling activities, and some states have expressly framed laws to regulate online games also,” it added.The Centre also said that several states had already framed laws to regulate online gambling and hence, it is for the Delhi government to formulate its policy.MeitY, on the other hand, said that while the petitioner sought a complete ban on online gaming and betting across the country, he has not impleaded other states as a party.“…the petitioner has not chosen to make any of the states (Sikkim, Nagaland, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, or Tamil Nadu) which have brought out legislations that specifically regulate online gaming. Without hearing the views of the states (which are the ‘appropriate governments’ given the legislative mandate enshrined under the Constitution of India), effective adjudication is not possible in this case,” the ministry said.It added that the legislative competence to determine whether a game is a game of skill or a game of chance or is involved in gambling (played with stakes or not) is conferred on the states or to the court of laws.“MeitY does not possess the judicial wisdom to determine whether an online game is involved in gambling or not,” it added.The court posted the matter for October 11 after the petitioner’s counsel said that he had not received the Centre’s reply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/online-gambling-a-threat-portals-can-t-make-profit-at-the-cost-of-young-lives-delhi-hc-101629919576142.html

The education minister should spend more time meeting teachers and hearing out their problems instead of visiting Tripura. He should resign after what has happened,” said Basu. Doctors at both hospitals said the women were stable but could not be declared to be out of danger before 72 hours. They showed symptoms triggered by organophosphorus compounds used in pesticides. Deputy Commissioner of Police (eastern suburban division) Priyabrata Roy said, “Police personnel tried their best to stop the agitators from consuming poison. We hope they get well soon.” Cases have been registered against the teachers since attempting suicide is a crime. Charges have also been brought against the agitators for violating Covid-19 pandemic restrictions on assembly in a public place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bengal-teachers-consume-poison-in-bid-to-prevent-transfers-to-far-flung-areas-101629919034678.html
26-08-2021||India||TN BJP expels two from party in connection with Raghavan sting video||Tamil Nadu unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday expelled party member and YouTuber Madan Ravichandran, along with his associate G Venba, a day after they released a video state general secretary KT Raghavan’s sexually explicit chat with a woman, the party said in a statement. Raghavan resigned from his post on Tuesday after the video went viral on social media. The BJP also said that a committee is set-up to probe allegations of sexual misconduct against Raghavan. Both Ravichandran and Venba met state chief Annamalai on Wednesday and agreed to cooperate with the probe, the party said in its statement. “Madan and Venba have been removed from their party posts for releasing videos that go against the ideals of the party,” the statement signed by another state general secretary Karu Nagarajan read. “We ask administrators and party cadres not to have any interaction with them in matters related to the party.”The YouTube channel Madan Diary, with more than 141,000 subscribers, and through which Ravichandran uploaded the video, has been taken down. In the video, Ravichandran said he began to look into the issue based on allegations of sexual harassment and sexual exploitation of women by male leaders of the party in the state. “I have video evidence of 15 BJP leaders but I’m releasing his video first because Mr K T Raghavan is promoted as Mr Clean by the media,” Ravichandran said in his piece to the camera. Reacting to the controversy, Annamalai, who took over as the state BJP president last year, questioned Ravichandran’s intent behind threatening to release video evidence of more BJP leaders on social media. “This act of him is purely unacceptable,” Annamalai had said on Tuesday. He confirmed Ravichandran had met him twice over this issue and sent him a text pressuring him to take action. Annamalai said he can only take action when the allegations are probed and proved and asked for the video evidence, but Ravichandran didn’t give it to him. “I stood firmly on my stand that disciplinary actions cannot be taken without knowing the real facts of the accusations. Therefore, I replied (to) him shortly in the message that ‘You may proceed if you want justice’,” he said. Raghavan had taken to Twitter on Tuesday to announce he is resigning but denied all the allegations and said that the video was released to tarnish his image. Ravichandran said that the audio in the video is muted, and the woman’s identity is protected as she agreed to do the sting operation. Ravichandran joined the BJP last October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tnbjpexpels-two-from-party-in-connection-with-raghavan-sting-video-101629918314318.html
26-08-2021||India||Onam fallout: Kerala logs 31,455 new Covid-19 cases, 215 deaths||Kerala is witnessing an alarming rise in Covid-19 cases after the festival of Onam. On Wednesday, the state reported 31,455 new cases with a test positivity rate (TPR) of 19.03 per cent, the highest caseload and TPR in three months, the state health ministry indicated. With ramped-up testing, Covid-19 cases are shooting up exponentially and the worried health ministry has said it will tighten restrictions and increase vaccination to tide over the difficult situation. In vaccination the state is ahead-- 56.28 per cent of the population have got at least one dose of vaccine while it is 43 per cent in Tamil Nadu and 54 per cent in Karnataka, statistics show. What is disturbing is that when cases have shrunk considerably in the rest of India, Kerala shows no signs of relenting. Its death toll is also on the rise. It reported 215 deaths on Wednesday taking total fatalities to 19,972. Many experts had warned a big surge after the Onam festivities and latest statistics prove their concerns were justified. Norms were eased and markets were jam-packed ahead of the festival-- last year also there was a surge after Onam. The intensity of the surge can be gauged when compared with the national situation. On Wednesday the country reported 37,593 new cases and with TPR below 2%. Many hospitals have started feeling the pinch of the high caseload. Leading government hospitals said they have only 10 per cent beds left but there is no shortage of oxygen or essential medicine. The ICU occupancy (both private and public) is stable now with 2,080 patients in ICU and 780 are on ventilators. Doctors said there is a 10 per cent hike in hospitalisation in the last two days. Out of 14 districts, four reported more than 3,000 fresh infections. During the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the state was praised for its effective handling of the situation but the second wave dragged and it reported more than 65 per cent of the total cases of the country. Experts blame low testing, low sero prevalence and over confidence for the sorry state. As cases surge experts and medical bodies have asked the state government to conduct more genetic studies and sero-prevalence surveys to confirm the presence and depth of various strains in the state. “We expected a hike after Onam. A special drive is on to increase testing and vaccination. Since sero prevalence is very low in Kerala we have to find the infected and quarantine them at the earliest. We will do everything possible to contain the surge,” said state health minister Veena George. It seems the health ministry appears to be resigned to the fate that a major surge is inevitable after Onam and is now bracing to see how the graph will rise. Experts have asked the state to shed its soft corner for cheap antigen tests and do more RT-PCR tests.On Monday when Tamil Nadu had 1,52,000 RT-PCR tests, Karnataka had 91,982 and Kerala’s share was 86,650. “The surge is on expected lines. The government will have to increase tests and vaccinate maximum people. It is time to act,” said Dr N M Arun, an internal medicine expert who has been tracking the case trajectory of the state. The fourth round of the sero survey conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research in July showed antibody prevalence was 67. 7% nationally but it was only 42.7 % in Kerala, meaning a huge chunk of its population is still susceptible to the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/onam-fallout-kerala-logs-31-455-new-covid-19-cases-215-deaths-101629917894505.html
26-08-2021||India||Scindia writes to 5 CMs over aviation infra||Union civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia has written to the chief ministers of five states – Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar and Chhattisgarh – seeking personal intervention in matters related to land allocation and funding to boost aviation infrastructure in the regions, the central government said on Wednesday.In a letter to Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, the aviation minister noted that the state had already handed over a quantum of land in most of its airports. “However, some portions of land are yet to be handed over to AAI by the state government,” the letter read.The ministry also noted that an amount of ₹14.64 crore needs to be deposited with the Regional Air Connectivity Fund Trust by the state.Similarly, Scindia sought the intervention of Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu in land acquisition for various aviation sector projects, including the installation of Non-Directional Beacon and construction of a residential colony for the airport staff at Tezu Airport.In his letter to Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, Scindia said: “Out of the total projected land, only 8.5 acre of land has been handed over at Dibrugarh Airport, and rest of the land parcels are yet to be handed over by the state government.”The aviation minister told Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar that the state should take into consideration the scope for international connectivity and consequently viability of operation of a wide body aircraft.While writing to Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, Scindia highlighted matters related to land requirement of 569 acre at Raigarh for development of the airport to make it suitable for operations of ATR72/Q400 type of aircraft in Phase-l and AB-320 type of Aircraft in Phase-II.Urges 22 states to reduce VAT on ATF to 1-4% Scindia has urged 22 states and Union Territories to reduce value-added tax on aviation turbine fuel and bring it within the range of 1-4% across all airports in order to give an impetus to air travel, the civil aviation ministry said.“The price of ATF is a major component of the operating cost of airlines. With that, the tax on ATF contributes significantly to the ATF price,” according to a statement issued by the ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scindia-writes-to-5-cms-over-aviation-infra-101629917534339.html
26-08-2021||India||Decide plea on top cop in two weeks, SC tells Delhi high court||The Supreme Court, on Wednesday asked the Delhi high court to decide within two weeks the petition filed before it challenging the appointment of Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police commissioner, observing that “time is of the essence”.A bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana allowed an NGO, Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), to move a plea before the high court and argue its case “substantially”.“We understand time is of the essence in this matter. We can fix a time limit of two weeks for the high court to dispose of this matter... you can argue your petition substantially without getting bothered by the other petitioners before the high court,” the bench, which included justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant, told CPIL’s lawyer Prashant Bhushan.The court also kept CPIL’s petition before it against Asthana’s appointment pending, observing it would like to have the benefit of the high court order before the case is taken up after two weeks.“We request the Delhi high court to consider the matter as early as possible and preferably within a period of two weeks from today to enable us to have the benefit of the judgment of the said court... If the petitioner (CPIL) wants to file any intervention application in the matter pending before the high court and/or to assist the said court, it would be at liberty to do so,” the bench stated in its order.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Union government, submitted that two weeks could be insufficient for a decision in the case by the high court. “Heavens are not going to fall. Two weeks may not be sufficient. We have to also put in our reply. Give at least four weeks,” argued Mehta.But the court turned down the SG’s plea for extending the time. “Let the high court say something,” responded the CJI.A day earlier, the high court adjourned a similar petition filed before it by an advocate to September 24 after taking note of Bhushan’s statement that CPIL’s petition for identical relief is coming up before the Supreme Court on Wednesday. The high court observed that there should not be contradictory orders passed by two different courts in identical matters.On Wednesday, when the CJI-led bench took up CPIL’s petition, the SG questioned why the NGO’s petition should be entertained directly by the Supreme Court when the Delhi high court is competent to decide the issues involved. “What fundamental rights of the petitioner have been taken away by this appointment?” asked Mehta.When asked by the bench, Bhushan said that he does not want to argue this case before the high court since the petition there could be an “ambush petition” by somebody, who in complicity with the government, wants the case to be dismissed. He contended that Asthana’s appointment on July 27 was in egregious violation of the laws and the orders of the apex court and violated the fundamental rights of the people in Delhi.Bhushan also submitted that the petitions seeking quo-warranto (a writ) can be filed under Article 32 (writ jurisdiction for protection of fundamental rights) and that the Supreme Court has earlier issued directions regarding the appointment of the central vigilance commissioner in a petition filed by CPIL.At this, CJI Ramana expressed his reservations in hearing the petition, pointing out that the CJI had conveyed his views about Asthana when the 1984-batch IPS officer was being considered for the post of chief of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).In May, CJI Ramana, while participating in the high-powered committee for the selection of the CBI director (the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha were the other members), flagged a 2006 Supreme Court ruling that required a police chief to have a minimum residual tenure of six months, resulting in the disqualification of Asthana from being considered for the post of CBI director.“There are two issues. One, I have expressed my views about this gentleman during the CBI selection...I don’t want to comment on the merit of this case. And second, there is already someone who has moved the high court. We are fixing a time limit of two weeks so that the high court could decide it,” the CJI told Bhushan.Interestingly, CPIL’s petition references the same 2006 Prakash Singh case.On his part, Bhushan insisted that the Supreme Court should not simply send this matter to the high court, and argued that Asthana’s appointment was one of the most brazen examples of flouting the laws and the orders of the apex court.“There was first an order in July approving his (Asthana’s) inter-cadre deputation from Gujarat cadre to AGMUT (Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram and Union Territory) cadre to make him eligible for the post. Then he is given an extension of one year and finally, four days before his retirement, he is appointed as the police chief. And he is appointed only for one year. The rule regarding the minimum six months’ tenure; the rule regarding empanelment by the UPSC; the rule regarding a minimum tenure of two years; everything has been thrown to the wind just to appoint this gentleman,” claimed the lawyer.The -G contested Bhushan’s statements regarding “ambush petitions” and said that the court has seen professional PIL litigants who file surrogate pleas. “Suppose, tomorrow there is a petition challenging the appointment of police commissioner in Chandigarh or Bengaluru. Will this court entertain it directly under Article 32?” asked Mehta.The bench, however, said that it will adjourn the case for two weeks while asking the Delhi high court to decide the matter before it by then.CPILapproached the top court to quash Asthana’s appointment as Delhi Police chief, contending that the appointment order is in clear and blatant breach of the directions passed by the top court in the Prakash Singh case, which required a police chief to have a minimum residual tenure of six months. Besides, CPIL claimed, no UPSC panel was formed for the appointment and the criterion of having a minimum tenure of two years was also ignored.“The post of commissioner of police in Delhi is akin to the post of DGP of a state and he is the head of police force for the NCT of Delhi and therefore, the directions concerning the appointment to the post of DGP passed by this Hon’ble Court in the Prakash Singh case had to be followed by the central government while making the impugned appointment,” stated the plea.Another petition seeking to initiate contempt of court action against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah over the decision to appoint Rakesh Asthana as the Delhi Police commissioner was filed by advocate ML Sharma who mentioned the same before the Supreme Court on August 6. This plea, however, has not been listed to date.Advocate Sadre Alam has filed a similar petition before the Delhi high court where the Union government has taken a preliminary objection against the plea on the ground that the lawyer has no locus standi (legal standing) to challenge Asthana’s appointment. Representing the Centre, additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma argued on August 18 that service matters cannot be challenged in a PIL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decide-plea-against-capital-s-top-cop-rakesh-asthana-in-two-weeks-supreme-court-tells-delhi-high-court-101629917293756.html
26-08-2021||India||Modi chairs 37th PRAGATI meeting, reviews 8 Projects||New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday chaired the 37th PRAGATI meeting where he reviewed the functioning of eight projects worth rupees 1,26,000 crore. He also reviewed the progress of the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) scheme. PRAGATI is a communications platform that stands for Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation. Officers from various states were part of the meet.“Among the eight projects, three projects each, were from the Ministry of Railways and Ministry of Road Transport & Highways and two projects were from the Ministry of Power. These eight projects have a cumulative cost of Rs. 1,26,000 crores concerning 14 states…” a statement from PM’s office said adding that PM emphasised on timely completion of these projects.While reviewing progress on the ONORC scheme, PM told the officials to “explore the multiple utilities of the technological platform developed under the scheme.”The national database formed under the scheme lists the migrant workers and will be launched on Thursday by Labour Minister Bhupendra Yadav. Earlier on Tuesday, its logo was launched by the same minister.Various NGOs and even apex court had been stressing upon the government for early completion of this database. Migrant workers had complained of ration crisis ahead of the mass interstate migration of workers during the two Covid waves in the country.ONORC scheme aims at providing subsidised food grains to migrant workers and their family members at any fair price shop anywhere in the country under the National Food Security Act, 2013. Launched in August 2019, until now 32 states and Union Territories have joined the ONORC, and beneficiaries include over 739 million people.At the meeting, PM also stressed on states to keep monitoring the construction of oxygen plants and availability of hospital beds. “In the previous 36 PRAGATI meetings, 292 projects having a total cost of 13.78 lakh crore have been reviewed,” PM’s office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-chairs-37th-pragati-meeting-reviews-8-projects-101629917123298.html
26-08-2021||India||Bengal to go slow on Pegasus probe after SC calls for ‘restraint’||Nudged by the Supreme Court, the West Bengal government on Wednesday agreed to go slow on its probe into the Pegasus snooping controversy by a two-member commission of inquiry headed by retired judge Madan B Lokur.A top court bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, was clear that since the entire gamut of the Pegasus controversy was being considered by it in a separate bunch of cases where the Union government has offered to set up an expert committee to examine various aspects of charges related to the alleged snooping, it made sense for the West Bengal panel to “show restraint”.“Of course, it (commission by West Bengal) has a bearing with the set of other matters being heard by us. In all fairness, we expect that you can wait for some time. If you want us to pass some orders, we can do that too. But you will have to maintain restraint,” the bench, which also included justice Surya Kant, told senior lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared for the state government.At the outset of the hearing, senior advocate Harish Salve, who represented the petition filed by NGO Global Village Foundation Public Charitable Trust seeking disbanding of the commission, submitted that there cannot be two parallel inquiries in the same subject matter.Opposing this, Singhvi questioned the bona fide of the petition but the bench remained firm that notwithstanding the petitioner’s legal standing, the state government will have to hold its hand till the court takes up all the cases together sometime next week.“The other cases will have pari materia effect (form part of the same subject matter) on this case too. We will have your assistance when we hear those cases but you will have to agree to not do anything. You will not issue public notice or hold hearings,” the bench told Singhvi.At this, the senior counsel sought to point out that nothing drastic will be done by the commission in the next one or two weeks, but it must also be taken note of that there is a panel which is already examining the matter. “Between now and next week, nothing earth shattering is happening. But a single word by your lordships word will create a huge splash and that’s what they want,” submitted Singhvi.The bench, however, retorted: “But it is you who is inviting an order. We are saying that we will not stay (the proceedings before the commission) because you have agreed that you will not precipitate the matter. But if you start hearing and holding inquiries then we will have to stop it. Please, show restraint.”With the writing on the wall clear, Singhvi responded: “Please, say nothing. The court does not need to say anything. I will convey it. Nothing will happen for one or two weeks.”Following the assurance from Singhvi, the court issued a formal notice on the NGO’s petition and tagged it with the clutch of other cases filed by journalists, politicians and civil rights activists who have demanded a court-monitored investigation into the alleged snooping row.The Pegasus row erupted on July 18 after an international investigative consortium reported that the phones of Indian ministers, politicians, activists, businessmen and journalists were among the 50,000 that were potentially targeted by Pegasus, Israeli company NSO Group’s phone hacking software. According to this consortium, Pegasus can switch on a target’s phone camera and microphone, as well as access data on the device, effectively turning a phone into a pocket spy.On August 18, the bench agreed to examine the NGO’s petition, argued by advocate Saurabh Mishra who also asked for an immediate stay on proceedings before justice Lokur’s commission to avoid any parallel inquiry.On Tuesday, the West Bengal government filed its reply affidavit to the NGO’s petition, calling the Union government “non-committal and evasive” on the issue. Justifying the creation of the panel, which also comprised former acting chief justice of the Calcutta high court Jyotirmay Bhattacharya, the state said that the commission will “put into place effective countermeasures against any rogue foreign spyware”.The Mamata Banerjee-led government also questioned the motive behind the NGO’s plea, claiming that the trustee and chairman of the NGO has close links with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and its affiliate, Swadeshi Jagran Manch.“It cannot be disputed that RSS and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch and the ruling party at the Centre, the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) are affiliates and have often vilified the state government for political gains,” stated the affidavit, contending that the petition is filed with the intent to obstruct any independent inquiry into the matter.The West Bengal government further maintained that given the potential ramifications of the media reports on the fundamental right to privacy, independence of public institutions and the preservation of democracy, “the state government could not sit as a silent spectator particularly when the Union government was not only non-committal and evasive on the subject but had also at the very threshold dismissed the allegations under the rubric of sensationalism”.The Supreme Court is expected to take up next week a bunch of other petitions on the Pegasus controversy. Responding to these petitions, the Union government has offered to set up an expert committee to look into the row while maintaining that a “false narrative” is being spun over the use of Pegasus. The Centre has, however, refused to disclose whether it used Pegasus for tracking individuals, citing concerns of national security and defence of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-to-go-slow-on-pegasus-probe-after-sc-calls-for-restraint-101629916994342.html
26-08-2021||India||Ready for overflow of Afghanistan terror to India: CDS||India is concerned about terrorist activity in Afghanistan spilling over into the country after the Taliban’s takeover, but contingency plans are in place to deal with the scenario, chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat said on Wednesday.The CDS’s comments came days after Taliban wrested control of the Afghan capital Kabul, capping a swift takeover of most major cities in that country. Rawat, the country’s senior-most military commander, said India anticipated the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan but its rapid pace was still a surprise.“From the Indian perspective, we were anticipating the Taliban takeover. We were concerned about terrorist activity overflowing into India from Afghanistan. Our contingency planning is ongoing, and we are prepared for that,” Rawat said.He was speaking at an Observer Research Foundation (ORF) seminar on India-US Partnership: Securing the 21st Century, sharing the stage with Admiral John C Aquilino, commander, US Indo-Pacific Command. The two military leaders held a separate meeting on Wednesday and discussed matters related to peace and security in the region as well as bilateral military defence cooperation.“Everything that has happened [in Afghanistan] was anticipated. Only the timelines changed and certainly surprised us because we were anticipating this [takeover] happening a couple of months down the line,” Rawat said at the ORF event.In an assessment as recently as last month, the Indian side concluded that the Taliban would shift its campaign to capture territory from rural areas to urban centres and provincial capitals only by the end of August, after the completion of the withdrawal of US forces. The Indian side also expected that there would be air support for Afghan security forces from the US if the Taliban entered urban areas. Assessments done by both the Indian and Afghan sides also suggested that the fighting would continue for at least two to three months, till winter set in.However, the Taliban rapidly stepped up its offensive this month, seizing one provincial capital after another, both in the southern part of Afghanistan, the traditional stronghold of the group, and the north, where it had faced greater resistance in the past.This was done by concluding agreements with warlords and commanders of the security forces, and thousands of troops simply surrendered without a fight at a time when the Ashraf Ghani government showed no indication of taking the fight to the Taliban. There was no air support on display either.Rawat said the group, which was ousted from power in Afghanistan by US-led coalition forces in 2001, was the same Taliban that existed 20 years ago. “All that has happened is that partners have now changed. It is the same Taliban with different partners…We will make sure that any activity which is likely to flow out of Afghanistan and find its way into India will be dealt with in the manner in which we are dealing with terrorism in the country,” the CDS added.India should stay prepared for terror spillover from Afghanistan into Jammu and Kashmir via Pakistan, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd).“But working on a matrix of probability and possibility, the probability is there but possibility of terror inflow in J&K in the near future appears distant. The reason is that taking over control of Afghanistan by Taliban was easy but establishing control will be difficult. The group will channelise its energy to establish control there,” Jaswal said. He said India has a window of opportunity to finish off home-grown terrorism is J&K before the Taliban attempts to send a few leaders to exploit that network in India.With the Taliban now firmly in control of nearly all of Afghanistan, the biggest concern for Indian security agencies is the presence there of between 7,000 and 10,000 terrorists from Pakistan-based groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Haqqani Network, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan. These groups have targeted Indian interests in Afghanistan in the past, and some like LeT have carried out attacks on Indian soil.Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, the son of Taliban founder Mullah Mohammed Omar and the head of the group’s military operations, is believed to work closely with both LeT and JeM commanders. These two terror groups have also helped the Taliban with fund-raising, recruitment, and military advice.The ORF event on India-US partnership also put the spotlight on China expanding its military capabilities at a swift pace, including acquiring strategic weapons and building a fleet of aircraft carriers to operate and dominate waters thousands of miles away from its shores.“It is the largest military buildup since World War II, both in the conventional and the nuclear domain. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s words don’t really match their deeds,” said Aquilino, raising questions about Beijing’s intentions.Rawat said India was quite capable of dealing with China and Pakistan in the conventional domain. “Strategic weapons are weapons of deterrence, not for engaging nations in combat. We have two neighbours armed with strategic weapons. India is evolving its own strategies and has a triad,” he said. India’s nuclear triad gives it the capability to carry out nuclear strikes from land, air and sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ready-for-overflow-of-afghanistan-terror-to-india-cds-101629916874840.html
26-08-2021||India||Posters slam AMU V-C for condoling former CM’s death||Agra: Posters against Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) vice-chancellor (VC) Prof Tariq Mansoor for condoling the death of former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh appeared on the varsity campus, prompting the state government to warn of strict action against those with “Talibani thinking” after getting the matter probed. The posters, which appeared on Monday night, were later removed from the campus and strict vigilance was maintained to ensure they do not reappear, a college official familiar with the matter said.“Around 10 pm on Monday, a few posters were found pasted on the notice board near the mosque premises within the varsity campus. Some posters were found lying on the ground. These posters were removed. A search was also held to trace similar posters elsewhere in the campus but nothing was found,” Prof Wasim Ali, proctor of Aligarh Muslim University, said. “A team led by two assistant proctors kept vigil and no posters were found after that. These posters were in English but not signed. No individual or group owned responsibility for them. We have launched an inquiry into the matter,” Ali added. According to the official cited above, the posters claimed that the VC hurt religious sentiments by condoling the death of Singh, who was the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh when the Babri Mosque was demolished on December 6, 1992. Singh had resigned that same evening.The former chief minister passed away in Lucknow on Saturday after a prolonged illness. One poster said that Mansoor’s words condoling the passing of Singh were “ not only a matter of shame but also hurting religious sentiments of our community since it is against the ethos, culture and tradition of AMU”. It went on to blame Singh for the “demolition of Babri Masjid”. The posters were attributed to “Students of Aligarh Muslim University” . Taking note of the developments, state minister Mohsin Raza said the VC acted as per “our culture” and the posters were an attempt to vitiate the atmosphere. “If some persons of Talibani soch (thinking) are there, we will also treat them accordingly,” he said, adding that the matter will be investigated and strict action will be taken to set an example for others. “This is a university of Hindustan. The Taliban (Afghanistan’s militia group) is not here. This is an attempt to vitiate the atmosphere,” the minister of state for minority welfare, Muslim Waqf and Haj, added. In his condolence message, the VC on Sunday said: “Shri Kalyan Singh played an important role in the public life of the country and development of Uttar Pradesh. May his soul rest in peace and Almighty God give solace and strength to his family to bear this great loss.”Singh was among 32 people, along with BJP veterans L K Advani and M M Joshi, who were acquitted by a special CBI court in the Babri demolition case in September last year.

26-08-2021||India||Committed to holding caste census: BJP MP||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s member of Parliament from Maharashtra, Pritam Munde, also the daughter of one of the party’s most prominent Other Backward Class(OBC) leaders, the late Gopinath Munde, has reiterated the ruling party’s commitment to conduct a caste census, as articulated by her father on the floor of Parliament in March, 2011.Munde said that the BJP was not the kind of party that said one thing in opposition and then changed its position in government. Munde’s words come at a time when the demand for a caste census has grown louder .The demand is supported by some members of the BJP itself, many of its allies, including the Janata Dal United, and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, friendly parties such as the Biju Janata Dal and the YSR Congress, and almost the entire Opposition.The government itself has not explicitly taken a stand on the issue, give its sensitivity and the possibility that it could trigger a backlash, both from OBCs that lose out on benefits if th reservation formula is redefined following the census, and from upper castes that fear the survey could be a precursor to breaching the 50% limit for reservations.“My father was deputy leader of opposition when he spoke about it. It does not matter if you are in the opposition or in the ruling party as long as you feel for a cause. I don’t think we are that sort of party who come into power and then change their agenda or manifesto’’ Munde said.“When you already have reservation depending on caste system, then you need to know the total number of people belonging to a particular community. We do believe it should be done else how are we going to decide how much to reserve. Who decides OBCs are 27%?’’To be sure, the 27% number was arrived despite the Mandal commission estimating the OBC share of the population at 52% to ensure reservations did not breach the 50% ceiling mandated by the Supreme Court in the Indra Sawhney case. People belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes get 22.5% reservation for jobs and admission to educational institutions.In 2011, Gopinath Munde made a 20 minute speech in parliament where he put forth his party’s position on why an OBC census is required. In an emotive speech , and cheered on by other Opposition members, he said OBCs were wronged by having just one census in 1931.Interestingly the 2011 Census was accompanied by a caste census but its findings were never made public. The government claimed this was on account of inaccuracies in data gathering but it is likely political compulsions stayed its hand.Munde’s speech is now being referred to by those within the BJP who support the idea, including former Bihar deputy chief minister, and Rajya Sabha member Sushil Modi.”I have never come across anybody who is opposing this concept,’’ said Munde. “In the general census, in forms they ask you if you belong to SC or ST community, but no columns for OBC. If SC/ST need to be counted, then OBC should also be counted.’’When all parties from Bihar met the Prime Minister this week, he heard out all the leaders and the government is expected to take a call on a survey soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/committed-to-holding-caste-census-bjpmp-101629916815285.html
26-08-2021||India||Need SC approval for 10% EWS quota in medical colleges, Madras HC rules||The concept of reservation as envisioned by the Constitution was turned on its head by repeated extensions, the Madras high court said on Tuesday as it ruled that quotas for the economically backward classes in medical colleges needed approval from the Supreme Court.A bench of chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice PD Audikesavalu approved a July notification by the Centre to provide 27% reservation to Other Backward Class (OBC) candidates in medical colleges under the all-India quota (AIQ), and closed a contempt petition by Tamil Nadu’s ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) on the matter.But it raised a question on implementation of 10% EWS quota as it breached the 50% cap set by the Supreme Court in a landmark 1992 judgment.The HC observed that the concept of reservation, as envisioned by those framing the Constitution, had been “turned on its head” by repeated amendments and “the veritable reinvigoration of the caste system”.“Rather than the caste system being wiped away, the present trend seems to perpetuate it by endlessly extending a measure that was to remain only for a short duration to cover the infancy and, possibly, the adolescence of the Republic. Though the life of a nation state may not be relatable to the human process of aging, but at over-70, it ought, probably, to be more mature,” the bench added.The DMK’s contempt petition contended that central government officials should be punished for not implementing an order of the high court issued in July 2020 in favour of OBC reservations in medical seats.“The notification of July 29, 2021 issued by the Union as a consequence of the order dated July 27, 2020, appears to be in order insofar as it provides for reservation for scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and OBC categories...” the bench said.”The additional reservation provided for economically weaker sections in the notification of July 29, 2021 cannot be permitted, except with the approval of the Supreme Court in such regard,” the bench added.The bench’s objections appeared to stem from the fact that with the 10% quota for EWS, the total quantum of reservation breaches the 50% cap set by the Supreme Court. In a verdict in May this year, the top court refused to relook at the 50% cap.Challenges to the EWS reservation -- instituted in 2019 ahead of the general elections -- are pending before the apex court.In a response in Parliament in July, the government had said that the May verdict of the Supreme Court won’t affect EWS quotas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-sc-approval-for-10-ews-quota-in-medical-colleges-madras-hc-rules-101629916759595.html

26-08-2021||India||Rajasthan internal rift may reflect in AICC reshuffle||For the Congress, which is busy firefighting in Punjab and Chhattisgarh, its crisis in Rajasthan is far from over. And it might reflect in the forthcoming organisational reshuffle of the All India Congress Committee.There is speculation that former deputy chief minister of Rajasthan Sachin Pilot, who rebelled against chief minister Ashok Gehlot, might be assigned a plum position in the party organisation. Pilot, 43, has been a former Union minister, deputy CM and president of Rajasthan Congress.Congress leaders claimed that going by the negotiations between Pilot and the party high command, he is expected to handle an “important” organisational responsibility and may even return to the Rajasthan government at a later stage. When contacted, Pilot said, “I am a loyal soldier of the Congress. I have not heard anything. But I will give my 100% in whatever task my party gives me.”The biggest hurdle in a smooth resolution, according to two Congress insiders, is the pending issue of “resettlement” of MLAs loyal to Pilot who are now out of the Gehlot government. Before the resettlement happens, it might be politically difficult for Pilot to be accommodated in the top rung of the party leadership.“Party workers, who actually fought the election, toiled on the ground and helped the Congress win the election in 2018, have not been rewarded. Pilot had raised this issue repeatedly with the high command. But so far, there is no decision,” said a senior Congress leader from Rajasthan.The Congress, especially Ashok Gehlot, however, has not much to worry about immediately as the state government survived the threat of rebellion last year and is now in a comfortable position in the assembly. The rebellion fizzled out and Pilot lost both his deputy CM berth and the chair of the state Congress.But for the long-term prospects of the Congress, which lost young leaders such as Jyotiraditya Scindia (now the Union civil aviation minister), Himanta Biswa Sharma (now the Assam CM) and Jitin Prasada, an early resolution of the Rajasthan crisis could be helpful. In fact, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, in his breakfast meeting on August 3, had reportedly told some opposition leaders, “I am trying to resolve the Rajasthan issue soon.”But the recent political appointments in Rajasthan have further complicated the situation. The state has appointed chairpersons and members to various commissions, but a majority of these posts have gone to retired bureaucrats allegedly close to Gehlot. A close relative of former Aam Aadmi Party leader Kumar Vishwas and a relative of West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar have also been allegedly given appointments, but Pilot loyalists are still left out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-internal-rift-may-reflect-in-aicc-reshuffle-101629916693694.html
26-08-2021||India||SC tells CBI, ED not to delay investigations in cases against MLAs, MPs||The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) not to keep the sword of investigation hanging over MPs and MLAs indefinitely, and to conclude such cases one way or the other.“There is a case pending investigation since 2010 by ED...another case by CBI since 2013. The charge sheet is yet to be filed. Why should an investigation remain pending for so long? Don’t keep the sword hanging over them...don’t give an impression that the investigation is still on. Either file a charge sheet or close the case,” a bench, led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for CBI and ED.The bench, which also comprised justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant, was hearing a public interest litigation filed by Bharatiya Janata Party leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, who has raised the issue of fast-tracking criminal trial against lawmakers and constitution of special courts.After going through the status report submitted by CBI and a note shared by amicus curiae (to assist the court) and senior advocate Vijay Hansaria, the bench underscored that out of 121 cases probed by CBI against sitting and former MPs and MLAs, investigations were not over in 37 of them.Similarly, in 122 cases registered by ED under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), investigations were pending in 76 cases.“We want an explanation of the delay in investigations by the CBI and ED... We have a lot of time but we don’t know if investigating agencies also have the time to analyse why these cases have been pending for so long,” commented the bench.It observed that the court does not want to demoralise CBI or ED but the delay in completion of the probe required a proper explanation and swift action.About the cases being probed by ED, the bench told Mehta: “Your report is very inconclusive. You have not given any reason for not filing a charge sheet for 10 years in some of the cases. You attach properties but you do not file charge sheets. No purpose will be served only by attaching properties... We are not here to create hindrances in the probe but the cases have to be decided either way. You have to conclude them.”The court also asked the S-G to have an action plan to evaluate the manpower and other resources required by CBI and ED. “Just like us (courts), investigating agencies are also suffering from lack of infrastructure, manpower and other resources,” observed the bench.At this, Mehta said that he would have a joint meeting of directors of both the agencies to figure out the shortcomings and resolve the issues relating to manpower.The S-G also requested the bench to issue directives on expediting the trials against the lawmakers by fixing a timeline of six months for completion of investigations and a reasonable time frame for conclusion of trials.“Where are the judges? There are 1000 cases pending in one trial court. How do you expect us to expedite trials? We wanted the Government of India to create special courts separately and provide infrastructure but it looks like you are not in a position to do it... We are all in the hands of the S-G. As and when he can provide us infrastructure, we can hear the cases on an urgent basis,” retorted the court.Hansaria also urged the bench to pass certain directives for speeding up the cases of legislators before the trial courts but the bench was of the view that no generic order can be issued to hear one category of cases out of turn. “You have to be practical. There is a shortage of judges. They have to hear several other cases too. Many other cases are also priority matters,” it said.The amicus further raised the issue of withdrawal of cases by several state governments including the Uttar Pradesh government that has withdrawn 77 cases against political leader Sadhvi Prachi and three sitting MLAs – Sangeet Som, Suresh Rana and Kapil Dev — for making inflammatory statements during the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots.The bench said that it has already issued a direction earlier this month that no criminal case against MPs or MLAs can be withdrawn without an approval of the high court of the concerned state.“We are not against withdrawing cases but they cannot be withdrawn just by using the term ‘malicious prosecution’. But sitting in Delhi, we cannot examine all the cases states want to withdraw. Let the states go to the high courts and satisfy the high courts about withdrawal,” said the court, adding it will soon issue further directions in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-tells-cbi-ed-not-to-delay-investigations-in-cases-against-mlas-mps-101629916574611.html
26-08-2021||India||Shiv Sena MLA comment adds fuel to Rane ‘slap CM’ row||A defiant Union minister Narayan Rane targeted the Maharashtra government on Wednesday over his dramatic arrest as political tensions continued to simmer in the state with the Shiv Sena issuing threats and the Bharatiya Janata Party deciding to move court.A former Sena leader turned BJP minister, Rane was arrested on Tuesday for saying that he wanted to slap chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who allegedly forgot the year of India’s independence during a speech. Rane became the first sitting Union minister to be arrested in 20 years but was released on bail late in the night by a court in Raigad district.On Wednesday, the state government told the Bombay high court that it will not take any “coercive” action against Rane but the minister remained combative.“I am not afraid of anyone and I am not backing out. My words were an expression of anger against the chief minister who forgot the year of India’s Independence. I only told reporters what he had already said, so how can it be a crime?” he said.The 69-year-old politician also alleged that Thackeray in the past had said Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath should be hit with sandals. “Thackeray called Union home minister Amit Shah shameless. He even said he was using unparliamentary words deliberately to describe Shah. Why was no action taken then?” Rane asked.Shiv Sena leader and spokesperson Sachin Ahir said, “The law is equal for all, we do not deny it but Rane has been targeting our party and leadership continuously without any reason for the last two years. Whatever Uddhav ji has been speaking against leaders from BJP has been a reaction to issues pertaining to that particular time. We do not justify the violence by our workers but it’s a reaction to the remarks by Rane. Action has been taken against them as well.”Rane’s comments had sparked violent clashes across Maharashtra on Tuesday as Sena workers went on a rampage, vandalising some BJP offices. Tempers continued to run high on Wednesday.The party’s Hingoli legislator Santosh Bangar dared Rane to remove his security and face him. “We have the strength to come and bash you at your house. You keep your police protection aside. I, Santosh Bangar, a Sena activist will come alone and if I don’t remove your guts then I will never take my name again,”Bangar told local channels.BJP legislator Ram Kadam said the party would like to see the action taken by the Sena-led government. “These are all empty threats but since they are made by the legislator we would like to see what action will be taken against Bangar for threatening a union minister,” said Kadam.Sena defended Bangar. “Shiv Sainiks are emotional about their chief and Narayan Rane provoked them with such insulting remarks. Its Rane’s fault which is facing such backlash,” said Sena spokesperson Manisha Kayande.Nitesh, Rane’s younger son and BJP lawmaker, tweeted a video indicating that a befitting reply will be given for the action against his father.In a speech on Monday, Rane criticised Thackeray for allegedly confusing the number of years since India’s independence during the chief minister’s August 15 address. “It is shameful that the chief minister does not know the year of independence. He leaned back to enquire (with his aides) about the count of years of independence during his speech. Had I been there, I would have given him a slap under his ears,” Rane had said.On Tuesday afternoon, he was arrested while addressing events as part of the Jan Aashirwad tours being done by newly inducted Union ministers across the country.On Wednesday, the minister for micro, small and medium enterprises defended his comments and attacked Thackeray.“Thackeray asked his party workers, on August 1, to give a tight slap to (BJP legislator) Prasad Lad who had threatened to attack Sena Bhavan. Thackeray used derogatory language against Yogi Aadityanath and said that he should be beaten with chappals. He also called Union home minister Amit Shah shameless. Why action was not taken against him and why only against me? Whatever I spoke was out of the anger against Thackeray for him forgetting the year of independence of the country,” said Rane.He also condemned the violent clashes.“Sena has no power to beat up any BJP worker or leader. They pet stones from distance. BJP would not allow the violence to take place here in Maharashtra like it happened in West Bengal,” he said, referring to post-poll violence in the eastern state.The BJP also threatened to move court against Sena leader and transport minister Anil Parab for his purported orders to the police to arrest Rane.Parab, a close aide of Thackeay, was caught on camera giving instructions to someone--apparently a police officer--to arrest Rane without waiting for an arrest warrant and use force if necessary.“He asked the police to arrest Rane without warrant. We are moving court to understand in which capacity he was giving orders to the police. We are also moving court against Sena leader and deputy chairman of legislative council Neelam Gorhe for her political statement. The government has been acting with political vengeance by misusing police force,” said Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil.BJP leader and former minister Ashish Shelar demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into Parab’s alleged orders.“The leaked video clip was shot between 11 and 1pm on Tuesday when the hearing on bail application by Rane in high court and the session court had yet to begin. Despite which he told the IPS officer on other side that the application was rejected. He also orders the officer to arrest union minister by using force. The entire episode is shaky and needs to be investigated by a central agency like CBI,” he said.BJP’s vice president from Nallasopara, NAME, filed an FIR against Parab.Neither Sena nor Parab responded to requests for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-am-not-afraid-of-anyone-stand-by-my-wordsrane-101629916154966.html
26-08-2021||India||Vaccinate all teachers by September 5: Centre to states||Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Wednesday announced that more than 20 million additional doses of Covid-19 vaccines will be distributed to states this month to vaccinate all school teachers on priority before Teachers’ Day on September 5. “This month, under the government’s free vaccination programme, we are providing 2 crore additional Covid-19 vaccine doses to all States. We have urged all states that before September 5 that is observed as Teachers Day, states should try and vaccinate all school teachers on priority,” the health minister tweeted. In a letter to all states, additional secretary of health ministry Manohar Agnani said the step was being taken to ensure protection of all teachers against Covid-19. “To facilitate this priority vaccination of all school teachers… additional Covid-19 vaccine doses have been provided to all states during the current month (to reach the States between 27th Aug to 31st Aug), for special campaign to vaccinate beneficiaries due for 2nd dose along with teaching and non-teaching staff of all government and private schools,” Agnani said in his letter.The Centre had allowed state governments to decide on reopening of schools keeping in mind the Covid-19 situation, in October last year. While several states had partially resumed physical classes, there was a complete closure again in April this year after a second wave of the disease hit the country.With an improvement in the Covid-19 situation again amid drop in cases, several states have begun reopening schools now even as concerns have been expressed over the staff and teachers not being completely vaccinated.As part of the exercise, the Centre directed states to document the vaccination status of teachers and non-teaching staff from secretaries of the school education department. The data should be triangulated with a unified district information system for education database to know the district wise number of teachers and non-teaching staff of schools.“This triangulation exercise will help in estimation of beneficiary load for special vaccination campaigns, thereby supporting efficient microplanning of such campaigns at district and subdistrict level through convergence of health and education department officials… and tailor made strategies as per the local needs,” the letter read.Union education minister Dharmedra Pradhan welcomed the health ministry’s decision and requested all states to cooperate. “Along with securing our future generation against Corona, this will prove to be a decisive step towards removing the obstacles in their studies caused due to this pandemic. I also request all the state governments to give their support and cooperation to this campaign in order to strengthen the foundation of the future,” he tweeted.States were also directed to make use of district magistrates to oversee the implementation of special vaccination campaigns; and earmarking specific days or specific Covid vaccination centres for conducting such campaigns so as to fully cover the target population group. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan also chaired a high-level meeting with states to review the vaccination progress. The health secretary advised states to focus on enhancing second dose coverage, for which he stressed on having a definite district level plan to cover maximum beneficiaries.“The states were also requested to identify districts whose vaccine coverage is lower than the state average and monitor as well as enhance progress of vaccination in these districts,” a statement by the health ministry on the review meeting read. The secretary also reviewed the policy of maintaining adequate buffer stock of medicines used in treating Covid-19. The states were told that they could also procure and maintain a buffer stock of medicines they deemed necessary other than the eight essential Covid drugs compulsorily mandated by the health ministry. “…most of these medicines can be supplied for use only after two to four weeks post production when the batch undergoes necessary quality testing; therefore advance planning for their procurement is required. Stock up early when cases are less and therefore demand is low, and procurement should happen in a staggered manner so that the logistics of production are not overwhelmed,” Union pharma secretary S Aparna said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccinate-all-teachers-by-september-5-centre-to-states-101629915558523.html
26-08-2021||India||Kerala records sharp increase in Covid infections after Onam||Kerala reported 31,445 Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, with a test positivity rate (TPR) of 19.03%, both the most in three months, suggesting that experts’ fears about the Onam effect may not have been misplaced.The cases reported were 70% of the total cases reported from the country on Wednesday.“We expected a hike after Onam. A special drive is on to increase testing and vaccination. Since sero prevalence is very low in Kerala we have to find the infected and quarantine them at the earliest. We will do everything possible to contain the surge,” said state health minister Veena George.Kerala’s biggest festival Onam was celebrated last week; the government relaxed restrictions for it, despite the state being an outlier in terms of positive cases over the past few months. Markets were jam-packed ahead of the festival; last year too, the state saw a surge in cases after Onam.The fourth round of the sero survey conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research in July showed antibody prevalence was 67. 7% nationally but it was only 42.7% in Kerala, meaning a huge chunk of its population is still susceptible to the virus. However, this theory is yet to be proven, and ICMR itself has said it does not make sense to disaggregate its overall sero-prevalence number across states.What is evident -- but again, not established -- is that Kerala, which escaped the brunt of the second wave in April and May is now seeing it, with infections likely being driven by a variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. If there’s a silver lining it’s the state’s vaccination numbers: 47.5% of the eligible population have received at least one dose of the vaccine and26.8% have been fully vaccinated. These are among the best numbers in the country for a mid-sized state.On Wednesday, the state reported 215 deaths taking total fatalities to 19,972. The number of active cases in the state as on Wednesday evening, was 170,292.Many hospitals have started feeling the pinch; government hospitals said only 10% of their beds are available, but added that there is no shortage of oxygen or essential medicines. The ICU occupancy (both private and public) is stable, the government claimed: 2,080 patients are in ICU and 780 are on ventilators. Out of 14 districts, four reported more than 3,000 fresh cases. Highest cases were reported from Ernakulam (4,048) followed by Thrissur (3,865) districts.Experts have asked the state to move away from cheap antigen tests and conduct more RT-PCR tests; the latter are considered the gold standard in testing. On Monday, Tamil Nadu conducted 1,52,000 RT-PCR tests and Karnataka 91,982 while Kerala’s share was 86,650. “The surge is on expected lines. The government will have to increase tests and vaccinate more people,” said Dr N M Arun, an internal medicine expert who has been tracking the case trajectory of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-records-sharp-spike-in-covid-cases-after-onam-101629915195162.html
26-08-2021||India||Three important medium-term questions about the economy||GDP numbers for the first quarter of 2021-22 will be released on August 31. In its latest resolution, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India projected 21.4% growth in the quarter. This will not make up for the 24.4% contraction in the same period last year. Other forecasters, such as State Bank of India’s chief economist have projected lower growth rates . The only reason these numbers have not set alarm bells ringing is because the June quarter saw a big disruption due to the second wave of Covid-19 infections.There is a view, especially within the government, about the inevitability of economic activity gathering momentum going forward. The biggest proof of this is the government’s roll-out of National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) for the next four years (from 2021-22 to 2024-25) this week. NMP is basically an exercise in leasing public assets to private players at a pre-determined price. The government expects to raise ₹6 lakh crore from this exercise over the period.Any such exercise only makes sense if the government can convince bidders that the economy will do well in the future. It is for this reason that the estimated proceeds have been qualified in the press release announcing the NMP. “The monetisation value that is expected to be realised by the public asset owner through the asset monetisation process, may either be in form of upfront accruals or by way of private sector investment. The potential value assessed under NMP is only an indicative high-level estimate based on thumb rules”, the release said.But what is the real state of the macro economy?The question of finance The press release issued on the roll-out of NMP has left the modalities of the implementation very broad based. “The assets and transactions identified under NMP are expected to be rolled out through a range of instruments. These include direct contractual instruments such as public private partnership concessions and capital market instruments such as Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvIT) among others.”One question that emerges is the method of financing such a monetisation programme. It is reasonable to assume that domestic capital will be a significant player in this exercise and private debt will be an important instrument. The sum involved is bound to have a significant impact on the debt market for infrastructure.RBI data available in the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) database shows that the total outstanding credit to infrastructure sector was ₹10.9 lakh crore at the end of 2020-21. So, the expected NMP proceeds are almost 60% of total outstanding credit to infrastructure. This highlights the credit market churn which NMP will unleash, even more so, when it is read along with an ambitious target for private investment under the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP). These numbers also underline the risk to the financial system any exuberance in valuation of the assets being monetised can bring, via future bad loans.How important are capital market driven wealth effect tailwinds for formal sector engine of the economy? Anybody who invested a significant sum when the stock markets crashed in March 2020 would have almost doubled it today. The ongoing stock market rally is bound to have generated a significant amount of positive wealth effect in the economy, especially among the classes and institutions which matter when it comes to big ticket investments. A look at the PE multiple – the ratio of price of a share and earnings per share – of the benchmark BSE Sensex shows that the stock market is more overvalued than it was before the pandemic. The persistence of a loose monetary environment has also encouraged another route to making stock market windfalls, where both institutional and high net worth individual players have exploited low interest rates to borrow money and invest in IPOs just to make listing day gains.The problem with such capital gains avenues is that they are not self-sustaining. As expectations of monetary tightening, both in India and abroad, increase, capital flight to advanced countries and profit booking endeavours might lead to a significant correction. Any such development is bound to create a significant negative wealth effect. While financial market exposure is not as high in India as it was in the US during the 2008 crisis, any significant correction will have a not insignificant effect on business sentiment. And corporate profits did not suffer significantly during the pandemic, ruling out the possibility of a large rebound as things improve. This reduces the likelihood of significant tailwinds to capital markets.Will inflation put a squeeze on future growth? Since December 2019 the Consumer Price Index has grown above RBI’s target of 4% every quarter. In the minutes of the latest MPC meeting, members warned against the practice of treating the upper band of 6% as the inflation target instead of the actual monetary target. RBI continues to maintain that the current phase of high inflation should be seen as transient and supply-side driven and monetary policy should do all it can do boost aggregate demand. Such an approach amounts to kicking the proverbial can of ”what will happen to already high inflation when aggregate demand picks up” down the road.The government has ruled out the possibility of providing any significant relief in petroleum prices. This is a direct fallout of the precarious fiscal situation. This will create a cascading effect on inflation. As the 2024 elections near, the government will have to consider bigger hikes in Minimum Support Prices, which have grown at a lower rate than retail inflation. Many experts expect a spike in services inflation, once vaccinations cross a critical threshold and demand picks up. Persisting high inflation can adversely affect growth via two routes. It can spook foreign capital , leading to exchange rate depreciation, adversely affecting India’s trade balance in energy (every barrel of oil will cost more in rupee terms). There is also the danger of high prices putting a squeeze on un-indexed earnings of informal sector workers, which will weaken aggregate demand.All the three questions discussed above can be combined in a simple, yet profound question: has the pandemic and the slowdown which preceded it damaged India’s potential growth rate?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-important-medium-term-questions-about-the-economy-101629904933070.html
26-08-2021||India||Scholar, Ambedkarite movement activist Gail Omvedt dies at 81||Gail Omvedt, a scholar renowned for her writings on Dalit history and politics, the Ambedkarite movement and social movements that challenged the caste hegemony prevalent in academic discourse,died on Wednesday at age 81. She is survived by her husband Bharat Patankar, daughter Prachi, granddaughter Nia and son-in-law Tejaswi.Born in Minneapolis in the United States, Omvedt came to India in 1971 for doctoral research on social movements and the work of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule. She began to live in Maharashtra and became an Indian citizen in 1983.Patankar, a well-known left activist, and Omvedt set up the socio-political organisation Shramik Mukti Dal in 1980 to address the issues of farmers and others toiling on land in Maharashtra. Over the years, the organisation took up concerns of those affected by dams, drought and project evictions, besides fighting caste-based oppressions.Omvedt’s scholarly writings were deeply connected with her activism on ground, and through both she influenced generations of students and young people. She was the head of the department of sociology and the Phule-Ambedkar chair in Sociology at the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU).Omvedt was also a prolific writer, having published 22 books including Mahatma Phule, Dalit and the Democratic Revolution, Understanding Caste, and a biography of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar. She also wrote articles for newspapers and worked on projects with the United Nations Development Programme.“As a researcher and a scholar, Dr Omvedt contributed significantly to the social movements, folk traditions, literature in India as well as for the rights of women and the underprivileged. Her contribution will always be remembered as a scholar who had devoted herself for the society,” Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said.The Dalit Intellectual Collective said she was one of India’s most original thinkers who did not let caste and class be erased in the feminist movement. “Time is yet to produce another scholar and incisive and capacious thinker like her,” it said in a statement.Historian Ramchandra Guha, Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Sitaram Yechury, Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar also offered their condolences.“Dr Gail Omvedt was a very high level public intellectual because she actually integrated with the aspirations of the common people particularly the Bahujan class in Maharashtra. Her analysis of the cultural movements in Maharashtra, particularly of Mahatma Phule’s Satyashodhak movement, took the Left movement ahead in the state,” Senior CPI (M) leader Ajit Abhyankar said.“She was always juggling with new ideas, concepts and analysis,” said Dr Shruti Tambe, Head of Department of Sociology at SPPU.“She wrote on the history of intellectual history of western Maharashtra when she spoke about the colonial resistance movement and brought out the contributions by Mahatma Phule, Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj and Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar in making western India different from other parts of India. She was a passionate student of sociology and visited India to study social movements. She then settled here to participate in various campaigns, agitations and movements,” Tambe said.“She was always busy writing, giving lectures even outside the university and contributing to serious academic gatherings. Her involved participation in the women’s movement and the movements of Adivasi, Bahujan and the landless people was very important in shaping her scholarship,” she added.Activist Kiran Moghe, president of the Pune Zilla Ghar Kamgaar Sanghatan said, “As a part of women’s and progressive movements, she made very prominent contributions to class, caste and gender issues. She made us all think about all the complexities of the situation we were grappling with as activists in the state. Her writing in English gave all these issues a kind of a global platform and it got projected globally.”“Her contribution in the social field will not be forgotten. Her work for displaced and project-affected people in particular,” activist Vivek Pandit said.Omvedt will be laid to rest on Thursday morning at the Krantiveer Bapuji Patankar Sanstha campus in Sangli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/american-research-and-rights-activist-gail-omvedt-passes-away-101629885310600.html
26-08-2021||Today's||Climate risk maps can mitigate the crisis and protect vulnerable lives||The just-released Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report 6 (AR6), has raised many flags for India about the continued increase in cyclones, heatwaves, rainfall extremes, sea levels, and so on. While 192 countries have submitted their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) reducing emissions, only 11 have submitted their second NDC. Revised NDCs are necessary to meet the global warming targets.For the first time, India contributed its own historic simulations and future projections to the IPCC climate assessment. But can India translate the IPCC reports to climate action?Not entirely.Protecting people and properties along with infrastructure, natural resources and biodiversity, call for climate adaptation plans. Climate adaptation is not necessarily a national issue, since the scales of adaptation are often local. Heatwaves and floods, for example, affect communities differently depending on the neighbourhood they live in. Unfortunately, such local adaptation actions do not follow directly from IPCC assessment reports. Therefore, risk maps at national, regional and local scales are needed for effective adaptation. These maps use key metrics to identify and record areas that are at risk of climate hazards.Also Read | Climate crisis: India now confronts a droughtClimate change risk is a product of climate hazards, exposure to these hazards, and the vulnerability of communities to respond to and recover from hazards. They typically include heatwaves, heavy rains, cyclones, and so on. Coastal regions face hazards such as tides, cyclones, rising sea levels, storm surge and inundation, while mountains face cloudbursts and landslides.Socioeconomic vulnerability depends on infrastructure, building constructions, technology (mobile phones, radio, TV, internet), economic (employment, household income, banking services) and social factors (female population, education, elderly and disabled population, children’s population).Exposure to these hazards depends on the region facing hazards — coastal or mountain regions, urban and rural centres, and so on. Exposure is a function of population density, growth rate, areas that are built-up, the length of coastlines, mountain slopes, and vegetation cover.Risk maps can effectively and efficiently guide adaptation actions to mitigate climate impacts and protect people, properties, infrastructure, food and fisheries production, and livelihoods. Despite the increases in hazards, this risk may decrease over time based on changes in exposure and vulnerability.A recently published risk map of India’s coast by a team of IIT Bombay faculty sheds light on coastal risks at the district level. Risk was computed for 2001 and for recent years. The differences in hazards, exposure, and vulnerability as well the net risk from climate hazards were computed to assess how the risks have evolved. A total of 65 coastal districts were chosen along the east and west coasts.The study finds that 54 out of 65 districts have seen an increase in hazards from 2001 to the current period. Vulnerability has actually decreased for 42 districts with Chennai and Mumbai being low-vulnerability districts. Balasore, a coastal district in Northern Odisha, has the highest vulnerability with the second and third most vulnerable districts being Valsad and Navsari from Gujarat.The low vulnerability of Chennai and Mumbai are of no comfort because the population density and built-up area make Chennai and Mumbai the highest exposure districts. As a whole, 45 districts are now at greater risk mostly because of increased hazards and most of the high-risk districts are on the east coast. The districts with the highest risk are the eastern districts, Purba Medinipur and South 24 Parganas in West Bengal, followed by Balasore in Odisha. Greater Mumbai ranks as the fourth -riskiest district and this is almost entirely due to its high exposure.Some key components of reducing risk include infrastructure, building codes, cyclone shelters, and early warning systems. India’s substantive investments in improving weather, climate and cyclone predictions have yielded impressive results in terms of early warning systems for cyclones, heatwaves, storm surges, heavy rainfall, and urban flooding.Further, integrations focused on developing the blue economy as a holistic management of land, to the ocean continuum to mitigate coastal risks to lives, property, and livelihoods, are needed. In addition to closing any last-mile gaps in the use and usability of early warning systems at the community and family levels, the use of technologies such as drones, satellites, autonomous ocean systems, and data analytics with artificial intelligence is critical for continued adaptation and learning-by-doing.The National Disaster Management Authority, state authorities, and programmes such as the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (affordable housing for the urban poor), National Cyclone Risk Mitigation, can synergistically identify knowledge gaps for improving risk maps and for disaster prevention, management and recovery.Similar risk mapping for other regions and sectors such as food, water, energy and health are the way forward for India’s climate adaptation and impact mitigation, which are projected to get only worse.Dr Raghu Murtugudde teaches at the University of MarylandThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/climate-risk-maps-can-mitigate-the-climate-crisis-and-protect-the-lives-of-the-vulnerable-101629980304342.html
26-08-2021||Today's||Don’t write off the West. Kabul may signal its revival||What does its hurried exit from Afghanistan mean for the West?There is little doubt that the United States (US) misread the strategic and political situation on the ground, anticipating neither the inglorious melting away of the Ashraf Ghani-led regime nor the way the Taliban struck deals across the country to capture power with little bloodshed within days.Criticism of the endgame has come from within the West. The United Kingdom (UK)’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, choked up over the prospect of some Afghans who helped the West not being able to get out of the country. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel thought the developments to be “bitter, dramatic and terrifying”, and was critical of the “domestic political reasons” for which the US stood firm on the withdrawal decision. Armin Laschet, her potential successor, called the withdrawal the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s “biggest debacle” ever. President Joe Biden has suffered a clear fall in reputation and popularity.Failure appears to be written all over — moral, intelligence, political, military and, indeed, of the West-led nation-building effort that spanned two decades. To detractors in Russia, China and the Muslim world, it is the strongest evidence of the West’s decline as a global power. They rejoice as the West scrambles to meet the August 31 deadline.Also Read | Afghan situation critical, evacuation priority: Jaishankar at all-party meetWhile this is undoubtedly a setback for the West, it is likely to be a temporary one. Far from portending its decline, the withdrawal and the ensuing crisis indicate the West’s resurrection. How?First, the American withdrawal completes a course correction initiated during the Barack Obama administration. Obama realised early that American occupation of Muslim societies in Iraq and Afghanistan was strategically counterproductive and politically unwise. It was giving fodder to radical Islamists, who justified terrorism by pointing to the occupation of their lands and imposition of an alien culture and values on their societies. Moreover, political modernisation imposed from above was generating resentment rather than appreciation.Obama oversaw the withdrawal of American forces in Iraq and set in motion a similar process for Afghanistan. The Iraq withdrawal led to the swift and nasty rise of Islamic State across Syria and Iraq in 2014, leading to re-deployment of western military forces and hardware. Iraq was territorially secured by 2017.Afghanistan did not face a similar security vulnerability as the Taliban were territorial nationalists who sought to oust an occupying force rather than destroy their own country to create a universal Caliphate. This difference was crucial as it enabled President Donald Trump to continue the policy of disengagement and strike a deal with the Taliban in 2020. Biden has led the policy to its conclusion.The withdrawal from Afghanistan thus marks an end to America’s messianic liberalism in the Muslim world that was launched in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Messianic liberalism has encouraged a violent culture clash of the western and Muslim worlds, which Obama indirectly acknowledged in his reconciliatory speech given at Cairo University in June 2009. As it disengages from Afghanistan, the West also significantly liberates itself from the charge that it interferes in Muslim affairs and is an enemy of Islam. It is increasingly for Muslim societies to determine their present and future. This should lessen the discord between two global cultural forces and free up western resources and attention for other issues.Second, with its evacuation operations centred on Kabul, the US has positioned itself as the leader of the West. No other western country possessed the military and logistical power necessary to ensure the scale of the humanitarian airlift being undertaken. It is either directly evacuating or securing the evacuation of western, Afghan and non-western nationals. Seizing the moment, Biden has called it one of the largest and most difficult airlifts in history. Western and partner countries have tied their evacuation goals to the US presence in Kabul.Third, western capitals have shown a cohesion not seen in recent years. At the G7 meeting held on August 24, they decided on a common approach to dealing with the Taliban. UK’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson emphasised the considerable political, diplomatic, and economic leverage the group possessed, which it would use to ensure safe passage for Afghans seeking to escape.Fourth, the US has also brought its non-western partners on board. A majority of around 25 countries participating in processing Afghan nationals coming out of Kabul are from Asia, Africa and South America.Finally, while there is no clarity on the number of Afghans who have been, or will eventually be, able to move out, or how many the western countries would eventually resettle, the flight is significant. Indeed, it is significant enough for the Taliban to accuse the West of poaching the country’s skilled human resource and prevent Afghans from accessing the airport. At the same time, the Taliban are clearly seeking to work the institutions and infrastructure built by the occupying forces. If the West could enable the exit of even a majority of those seeking to flee the country, it will salvage a fair bit of the Afghan nation that it helped build.All this shows high levels of coordination and multilateralism among western powers and their partners. This was highly unlikely to have been achieved had Trump been in power. We are witnessing signs of a reviving West under a Biden-led US. A bloc of states that can mount such a response is a formidable force. Beijing must be watching. And the Kabul setback notwithstanding, New Delhi has a reason to feel pleased.Atul Mishra teaches international relations at Shiv Nadar University, Delhi-NCR and is the author of The Sovereign Lives of India and PakistanThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/dont-write-off-the-west-kabul-may-signal-its-revival-101629972621894.html
26-08-2021||Today's||4 yrs after privacy judgment, former judges warn against delayed legal framework||With no movement on the personal data protection bill even four years after the landmark Puttuswamy judgment that established privacy as a fundamental right, former Supreme Court justices BN Srikrishna and AK Sikri, who have both been at the adjudicating end of the country’s privacy laws, have stressed on the need for a robust system that not only protects citizens personal data but also checks government surveillance in light of the Pegasus allegations.“We have been running on sand, if not in circles. On the other hand, thanks to rapid digitalisation, there is a deluge of data that is strewn around, collected and utilised without nary a thought about the privacy of the principals of the data,” Justice Srikrishna said.Sikri highlighted how the journey to establish privacy as a fundamental right began in 2012. “I think the entire world is embracing digitisation,” he said. “India has progressed quickly in terms of digital economy and use of technology. We talk about a digital economy but do not have the wherewithal to protect the rights of citizens.”The right to privacyOn August 24, 2017, a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court in Justice KS Puttaswamy vs Union of India passed a historic judgment affirming the constitutional right to privacy.It declared privacy as an integral component of fundamental rights of the Constitution; these rights cannot be given or taken away by law, and all laws and executive actions must abide by them. The court considered detailed arguments on the nature of fundamental rights, constitutional interpretation and the theoretical and philosophical bases for the right to privacy as well as the nature of this right.Also Read | Nitish Kumar positions himself as the face of Mandal 2.0The Supreme Court clarified that like most other fundamental rights, the right to privacy is not an absolute right. Depending on certain tests and benchmarks, a person’s privacy interests can be overridden by competing state interests. Through the judgement, the judges laid down a variety of such tests that can be used to ascertain an infringement of one’s right to privacy.In light of the Pegasus allegations, which claimed that an Israeli spyware was used to snoop on journalists, activists, Opposition leaders and others, and the delay in the enactment of the Personal Data Protection framework, there are widespread concerns about how the state can ensure the citizens right to privacy.Translating the right into policy and lawThe Puttuswamy judgment was followed by the Justice BN Srikrishna Committee, which submitted its report on July 27, 2018 titled “A Free and Fair Digital Economy - Protecting Privacy, Empowering Indians”, along with a draft Data Protection Bill, to the ministry of electronics and information technology.The committee’s focus was not singularly on protecting an individual’s right to privacy and spelling out the state’s responsibilities for the same, but also to foster an environment that encourages trade and industry in this sector.The 200-page report identified key issues in data protection such as consent frameworks, establishment of a regulatory authority for data, classification of data and data fiduciaries, regulation of cross-border data flows to name a few. The Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018 was submitted along with the report to the ministry.Then came a second Supreme Court judgment, wherein the constitutionality of Aadhaar, or the unique identification number was challenged. The case was based, among other issues, on lack of adequate privacy safeguards available. The court upheld Aadhaar but also struck down parts of the Act due to the lack of purpose limitation as it placed no limits on the usage of information collected.Following this, the government tabled its version of the Personal Data Protection Bill in the Parliament on December 12, 2019. Moreover, immediately after introduction of the Bill, it was sent to a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) for scrutiny. Several delays later, the Bill still remains with the JPC with a draft yet to be circulated among members.Also Read | The agony of being a secular Indian MuslimThe government also, separately and much later, moved on to introduce the controversial intermediary and digital platform guidelines that came into complete effect on May 25, 2021. The guidelines put in place a new mechanism for digital companies to regulate content, appoint officers who will be liable for compliance, and adopt features such as traceability of messages and voluntary user verification. WhatsApp has challenged the new rules, which mandate to trace the first originator of a message, in the Delhi high court stating it represents a “dangerous invasion of privacy”. The guidelines have also been challenged by various media houses, with the Kerala high court placing a stay on the rules.The fears of surveillance stateJustice Srikrishna and Sikri believe that the infrastructure to address right to privacy is inadequate in India.“My view of the 2019 Bill (the watered down version of the 2018 Bill) is that it is wholly inadequate to meet the challenges of privacy rights, which have been identified by the Puttaswamy judgment as fundamental rights. Another worrisome issue has been thrown out by the Court of Justice of the European Court Schremms II judgment invalidating the Data Shield agreement between European and transatlantic companies on the ground that the federal laws in USA afford easy access to personal data without enough safeguards, This is equally true of the 2019 Bill, if it ever, inter alia, becomes an Act of Parliament,” Srikrishna said.Sikri, who was on the bench for the Aadhaar judgment, said that when Aadhaar was introduced, there were concerns about the use of the data collected. “With Aadhaar, the main concern was protection of data from government use under the name of giving benefits,” he said. “Demographic details, iris and fingerprints were collected, which was perceived, at that time, as a lot of data collection. There were concerns that there is no misuse of this data that may lead to a surveillance state or be exploited by private players.”Also Read | In India’s climate law, focus more on process, less on outcomesSrikrishna also underlined that the current checks and balances to protect data privacy are “hopelessly inadequate”. “That is why, it was suggested in the 2018 report and the 2018 Bill that there should be a separate Parliamentary enactment postulating the objective for encroaching upon the privacy rights, with the law demonstrating how that objective is to be achieved and not being disproportionate to the objective to be achieved,” he said.Sikri concurred that as far as data is concerned, citizens in India remain at great risk. “The current IT Act throws up many questions, splintering our understanding of data privacy,” he said. “In last four years, there has been a great rise in digital economy that has again exposed a lack of privacy as the main issue.”The way forwardKazim Rizvi, founder of Dialogue, a policy institute that works on digital rights and privacy, said that the fundamental right to privacy needs to be cemented. “The right to privacy had its origins in pre-constitutional times and the initial conception of privacy protected the right of an individual’s agency to make decisions on exercising control over one’s private and domestic life. The right to privacy has now evolved to include even that of informational privacy after much legal struggle,” he said.Srikrishna also contested the introduction of non-personal data into the PDP Bill framework. “The PDP Bill was intended to deal with personal data and there was no consideration of non-personal data at all. The provision about non-personal data introduced in it, surreptitiously, is nothing short of legerdemain,” he said.To enact a robust system of check and balances, he said that the government should follow the Puttaswamy judgement scrupulously. “Citizens, State and commerce and trade have to be dealt with in that descending order of precedence. That would be the ideal situation. All else would be, to quote the Bard of Avon, ‘Sound and fury, signifying nothing’,” Srikrishna said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/4-yrs-after-privacy-judgment-former-judges-warn-against-delayed-legal-framework-101629971601921.html
26-08-2021||Today's||The agony of being a secular Indian Muslim||PHOTO: AfghanistanCAP: At a time of economic distress, Covid-19, floods and price hikes, it is politically expedient to turn the gaze on a Taliban-like enemy figure in Afghanistan rather than address other more urgent concernsIt can’t be easy being a secular, constitutionalist Indian Muslim in “new” India. The Hindu Right demonises Indian Muslims in a manner that they are expected to take a patriotism test on almost every issue. Islamist groups demand that all Muslims must assert a fierce religious identity, above all else. Caught between fanatical Islamism and majoritarian Hindutva, the secular Muslim is endangered and disempowered. The latest example of this is the manner in which the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan is playing out in domestic political narratives in India.The Hindu Right wants the Indian Muslim to speak out against the atrocities being committed by the Taliban. Islamists want the Indian Muslim to express community solidarity with the Afghan militia as “freedom fighters”. Every time a Muslim in India voices any kind of support for the Taliban, it leads to gloating “I told you so” chants and sedition cases being initiated. Conversely, every time a Muslim is attacked in India, it throws up accusations of a Hindu Rashtra being foisted upon the minorities. Toxic social media campaigns have only widened fissures.Lost in the cacophony are harsh realities that reveal the hollowness of the vicious politics of religious polarisation. Let’s first expose the Taliban cheerleaders.First, the Taliban is a violent militia which has acquired power, not by democratic means but by use of force. The gun cannot decide the will of the majority nor provide the predominantly Pashtun Taliban leadership with the impunity to discriminate against other communities.Second, the main victims of the Taliban’s brutal regime in the past have been co-religionists. Muslims have suffered the most in Afghanistan’s bloodied recent history. How does the return of the Taliban absolve it of the heinous crimes it has have committed against fellow Muslims? How can it be seen as an authentic representative of an Islamic brotherhood?Third, those who seek to pardon the Taliban’s sins on the grounds that it is strictly implementing Islamic Sharia laws have got it horribly wrong. It is pure opportunism and hypocrisy to endorse a secular Constitution in India where Muslims are in a minority, and then support the imposition of Sharia in those countries where the Muslims are in a majority. Moreover, who gives the Taliban the sole prerogative to decide the framework of Sharia laws for its people, and women in particular?Let’s now turn to those who seek to target the Indian Muslim for the Taliban’s wrongdoings.First, the Taliban resurgence is fundamentally an internal Afghan issue, not tied up in any manner with India’s fraught inter-community equations. It is not just for the Indian Muslim to speak up but for every citizen, irrespective of religious denomination, who swears by democratic freedoms to raise their voice against the Taliban’s excesses. The Taliban resurrection is not a “Muslim” issue, but a mirror to a catastrophic global failure to enforce the peace in Afghanistan.Second, those who wish to see Indian Muslims publicly reject the Taliban must disown all forms of religious extremism themselves. One cannot, for example, legitimise the hate-filled, violent activities of the Bajrang Dal against minorities in India and then demand that the Taliban be ostracised. Lynching of Muslims cannot be rationalised under the guise of cow protection laws or anti-conversion or the so-called “love jihad” type spurious campaigns, while breathlessly outraging when the Taliban violate human rights. Universal human rights cannot be selectively embraced or abused. A rejection of the Taliban must be accompanied by an elimination of a Talibani mindset.India is not a Taliban State, as a recent court order reaffirmed, but there are self-styled vigilante groups who demonstrate a bigoted mindset akin to the Taliban. This isn’t about whether an unlawful group of thugs is fringe or mainstream, Hindu or Muslim. The identity of the oppressed and oppressor must be irrelevant when acting against violent mobs.Third, while harshly condemning the Taliban’s criminal deeds, there must be a recognition that the fiercest resistance to the armed force has not come from the United States (US)-led global military alliance but from local Afghans themselves; 70,000 Afghan security personnel have died. While the US leads a desperate evacuation from Kabul, spare a thought for the brave Afghan citizens who have stood their ground despite a life-threatening situation. Don’t they deserve unequivocal support? Aren’t they also Muslims who break the stereotype sought to be imposed on an entire community?Radical Islamists and Hindutva rabble-rousers divide and rule by preying on the fears and anxieties of their followers only because they have so little else to offer. At a time of severe economic distress, Covid-19, floods and price hikes, it is politically expedient to turn the gaze on a Taliban-like enemy figure in Afghanistan rather than address the more urgent local concerns in the immediate neighbourhood. It’s the age-old trap of using religious politics as a weapon of mass distraction, one which all Indians must collectively battle.Postscript: More than 140 leading Indian Muslim voices have spoken out against the Taliban on the Indian Muslims for Secular Democracy platform. Unfortunately, their sane voices are rarely amplified while any Muslim influencer who aggressively defends the Taliban instantly grabs the headlines. It reveals as much about the state of a compromised media ecosystem as it does about a fractured society where hate speech has a large constituency.Rajdeep Sardesai is a senior journalist and authorThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-agony-of-being-a-secular-indian-muslim-101629970221943.html
26-08-2021||Today's||Scientifically Speaking | Radiation is a deadly threat to human space travel||On July 20, American billionaire Jeff Bezos flew on a Blue Origin rocket past the Kármán line, which, at an altitude of 62 miles, is the widely accepted boundary of space. The spacecraft topped out at 66.5 miles above the Earth, and its crew experienced a few minutes of weightlessness. Billionaire Richard Branson had reached the NASA-designated space boundary of 50 miles only nine days earlier. The other billionaire interested in space travel, Elon Musk, heads SpaceX, a company which has taken astronauts up to the International Space Station (ISS). Though Musk has not been in space yet, he has made no secret of his desire to take humanity to Mars and back.Some futurists think a permanent colony on Mars will be possible. I don’t expect to see one in my lifetime. The challenges of travel to Mars and survival on the planet are exceptional. Mars has thin air, frigid weather, and trace oxygen. And after 10 years on Mars at lower gravity, a spacefarer’s legs and bones would be so brittle that re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere would render them useless.Also Read | There’s more to losing weight than counting caloriesBut one of the greatest risks in space is from radiation. Ionising radiation causes damage to cells and to DNA inside them. In deep space, ionising radiation is of two main types — galactic cosmic rays that originate outside the solar system from exploding stars, and solar energetic particles from the Sun.Radiation poses an existential threat to humans and to all other forms of life. Unsurprisingly, NASA considers radiation one of the major unresolved problems of sustained human spaceflight. Returning astronauts might face a greater risk of various cancers, eye ailments, and cardiac events.The risks are not unique to humans either. Any organisms that accompany humans into space and to Mars would need to be able to withstand ionising radiation. As Christopher Mason writes in his eminently readable new book, The Next 500 Years: Engineering Life to Reach New Worlds, “Sending an Earth-evolved organism to another planet would result in almost-certain death.”Earth is an incomparable planet. The magnetic field of Earth is created by currents of electricity that flow in the molten core. The Earth’s internal magnetism creates a region around the planet known as the magnetosphere, which protects us from the harmful effects of most of the radiation of space.Several planets in our solar system have magnetospheres. Earth’s is the strongest of all the ones possessed by rocky planets. Our magnetosphere is a large, comet-shaped bubble, which has played an essential role in our planet’s habitability. Life would not exist on the planet without it.The Earths’ magnetosphere extends to about 40,000 miles. The ISS is positioned at a higher altitude than Bezos’ or Branson’s flight, and normally maintains a planned altitude of 248 miles. But since it is in low Earth orbit, it is still within the earth’s magnetosphere.Also Read | The shape of things to come in biologyThe ISS circles the Earth every 90 minutes at 17,500 miles. Even at that altitude, there are enough molecules of the atmosphere to change its velocity, and cause it to dip towards Earth. To maintain a constant orbit, propellant is fired to reposition the station.Astronauts on the ISS also experience the effects of radiation on prolonged visits. When astronaut Scott Kelly, who spent nearly a year onboard, closed his eyes, he could see streaks of high-energy ions flash like shooting stars. But the radiation he experienced was much lower than the amount that might be encountered on a future mission to Mars.The Moon is at a greater distance from the Earth than the ISS is. When Neil Armstrong went to the Moon, he wore foil plates on his ankles. Streaks of high-energy particles can be seen on these plates. But that was a relatively short mission.Any attempts to colonise Mars would need to reckon not only with radiation exposure to the trip to the red planet, but on the planet itself as well. The current scientific consensus is that Mars has a molten core, but that the protection on the planet is much lower than on Earth.NASA estimates that the radiation exposure from one mission to Mars might exceed the lifetime limit of astronauts. The actual limits vary by age and sex. But a 30-month round trip mission to Mars could result in 1000 millisieverts, which is roughly the same as the radiation exposure from 10,000 chest X-rays.Shielding ships and protecting exposure of astronauts is a proposed solution to the massive amounts of radiation on a trip to Mars. It seems to work well against solar energetic particles. But currently there are no spacecraft that can shield against galactic cosmic rays. Clearly, solutions to the challenge are necessary if we are to contemplate prolonged human space flight.In the more distant future, we might see the development of drugs that protect against radiation-induced damage. Another solution might be to genetically enhance humans to make them more resistant to DNA-damage. While this seems far-fetched now, scientists are currently studying animals like tardigrades that have high levels of radiation resistance to learn how they achieve it.But even as we look to the planets and beyond, it is clear that Earth is our home and there is no place quite like it. We take our comforts for granted, but they will not be found on Mars or anywhere else.Anirban Mahapatra, a microbiologist by training, is the author of COVID-19: Separating Fact From FictionThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/scientifically-speaking-radiation-is-a-deadly-threat-to-human-space-travel-101629862388399.html
26-08-2021||Editorials||In Kabul, India’s twin agenda||On Thursday, external affairs minister S Jaishankar briefed 37 leaders from 31 parties in Parliament on Afghanistan. The minister outlined India’s immediate priorities as the safe evacuation of all Indian citizens and assistance to Afghans in distress, and acknowledged the security and logistical challenges in doing so. He pointed to the fact that while friendship with the “people of Afghanistan” would guide India, its “footprint and activities” in the country will “naturally” keep in mind “ongoing changes”. And Mr Jaishankar suggested that given the complex situation, India would carefully wait and watch. All political leaders expressed their support for the government, while articulating their concerns about the strategic and security implications of events in Afghanistan.There are two issues here. The first is immediate — safety of Indians and help to Afghans. This is essential. It involves human lives. It is a test of India’s humanitarian commitment. And New Delhi must do whatever it takes, including talking to friends and foes and everyone in the middle, to rescue as many people who want to exit the country, both Indians and Afghans across religious denominations. Should New Delhi have been better prepared? Yes. But, to be fair, evacuation has been a challenge for all countries, including those who have spent two decades in Afghanistan and then fled.Also Read | Why Islamic State a threat in Afghanistan despite Taliban rule?But the other issue is the nature of the new regime in Afghanistan. There is a value to waiting and watching, especially if keeping quiet helps in getting one’s citizens out. But this mantra is also a result of the fact that India is not at the table as an external interlocutor, its Afghan friends aren’t in a position to shape developments, and its links with the Taliban are limited. What India can do is sound a warning about the terror machine that is a part of the wider Taliban network, seek the help of its new and old friends to ensure certain red lines are respected before granting official recognition to the new regime, and get ready for open engagement with the Taliban. India must also internalise that the era of relative peace may be coming to an end -- there is now potentially a second terror-sponsoring State in its western neighbourhood (which happens to be friends with the original terror sponsor) — even as it confronts an even more formidable adversary on the northern front. To tackle these strategic threats, a less polarised polity will help. The Thursday meeting was a good start.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/in-kabul-india-s-twin-agenda-101629979282824.html
26-08-2021||Editorials||Climate crisis: India now confronts a drought||Drought-like conditions are setting in over most parts of Gujarat, west Rajasthan and some districts of Odisha that have recorded significant rain deficiency during the monsoon, according to Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) data for August maintained by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). SPI is an index used for monitoring droughts. This substantiates the recent report of the Drought Early Warning System (DEWS) that said over a fifth of India’s land area (21.06%) is under different degrees of drought (abnormally dry to exceptionally dry). Last year, the corresponding figure for the same period was 7.86%.

Unlike other natural hazards such as cyclones and floods, droughts often develop gradually over a long period of time; they are “creeping disasters”. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which was released earlier this month, has warned that the South Asian monsoon has weakened in the second half of the 20th century, mainly on account of human activity, and that rising temperatures could mean more droughts.The gradual nature of droughts often prevents governments from recognising its deep long-term, socio-economic impact, often reducing the urgency that would otherwise trigger a timely and comprehensive response. India needs to expand the farm insurance net and ensure timely payouts, invest in greater adoption of micro-irrigation techniques, and introduce drought-resistant crops. These steps are important because droughts could further intensify farm distress (50% of the population is dependent on agriculture and more than 50% of the cultivable area rainfed), lead to over-extraction of groundwater, increase rural to urban migration, and intensify water conflicts between states and between farms, cities and industries. Effective drought-proofing, management and monitoring is the need of the hour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/climate-crisis-india-now-confronts-a-drought-101629973042848.html
