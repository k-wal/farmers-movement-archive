He said the verification process for income data is currently underway.As of now, about 54.73 lakh families have self-declared income of about 2.20 crore persons of their family in PPP with a total income of ₹1,35,724 crore.When calculated, the per capita income and per family income are ₹61,558 and ₹2,47,962, respectively.He said self-declared income is verified through digital medium from other available databases maintained by the central or state government and through physical verification by specially constituted committees. Verification of income is also done through digital medium with income tax database of the Central Board of Direct Taxes.The CM said the per capita income as per PPP database was different from the per capita income calculated on the basis of the gross state domestic product.Officials later said the PPP database still does not have the income statistics of the entire population and people with high net worth may not have come forward to share their income details as the PPP enrolment is voluntary.Khattar, meanwhile, told the House that about 2.20 crore persons (of about 2.54 crore) in state have given their signed consent by registering themselves for PPP till August 18.He said the PPP database serves as metadata for distribution of all government schemes, subsidies, services and benefits.Presently, integration of government schemes, subsidies, services and benefits with PPP is being done and the work is likely to be completed in the next three months.Upon integration, it will be possible to provide citizen services proactively anytime, anywhere without the need for documents as the data available with PPP database is pre-verified, he said.When Congress MLA from Tosham, Kiran Choudhry raised the issue of security of this database, the CM assured that the data is completely secure.“It is neither used for any other purpose nor shared with any private agency. The data in the PPP database is stored securely on the government cloud. The only portal works on an authorised user basis and no one has been given open access to the data stored,” he said.‘136 FIRs registered against farmers protesting farm laws’The Haryana government on Friday told the House that 136 first information reports (FIRs) have been registered till date against the farmers protesting the three central farm laws.In a written reply tabled in response to a question by Congress MLAs Bharat Bhushan Batra and Jagbir Malik, the government said two FIRs have also been registered against the farmers under Section 124-A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).This information was tabled in the assembly during the question hour on behalf of state home minister Anil Vij who did not attend the House due to health problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/question-hour-different-per-capita-income-figures-prompt-discussion-in-haryana-assembly-101629484147137.html

Before the outbreak of Covid--19, these widows used to visit the Prime Minister on Rakshabandhan but like last year, once again they are going to miss this opportunity due to the pandemic.“Though the widows are again missing a personal meeting with the Prime Minister on Rakshabandhan day, they have prepared 251 special rakhis with images of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and similar number of special Vrindavan themed cotton masks,” informed Vinita Verma, vice president of Sulabh Hope Foundation.The ‘rakhis’ were prepared by a group of aged widows living in Maa Sarda and Radha Tila Ashrams in Vrindavan.She said well-known social reformer and founder of Sulabh Movement Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak had started organising all important Hindu festivals and rituals for widows living in Vrindavan to break the social stigmas surrounding them.Prior to the pandemic, on behalf of thousands of widows, four or five widows used to visit Delhi to present baskets of ‘rakhis’ and sweets to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, she said.“The ongoing corona crisis disheartened these widows but it didn’t shatter their spirit so they started preparing rakhis and special Vrindavan themed masks for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Some of the rakhis contain photos of the Prime Minister with face in mask,” she said.Usha Dasi, 77, who had personally tied rakhi on the wrist of Prime Minister Modi in the past, was dejected as she was spending her days inside her ashram for the past five months .But she was happy that her rakhis and masks were sent to the PM. “I have personally designed special masks carrying messages like ‘Stay Safe’ and ‘Atamnirbhar Bharat’ and ‘rakhis’ with image of the PM wearing a mask”, said Usha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vrindavan-widows-send-rakhis-to-pm-101629484145961.html

20-08-2021||Noida||Monsoon breaks pause with light rain in Noida||After a spell of 10 days without rain, Noida got 2mm rain on Friday, classified as a “light shower”. It brought the maximum temperature down by around six notches to settle at 31.1°C. The relief is likely to be temporary as weather analysts predict that the dry spell may return after August 23 when meteorological conditions will turn unfavourable for rains.Weather analysts say that the “break monsoon” condition, which drove the 10-day dry spell, is likely to return as the monsoon trough line, which increases the chance of rain, will likely shift back to the Himalayan foothills depriving the plains of rains soon. However, this too is likely to be temporary.“Regions will continue receiving rainfall for another few days till August 23 as the low pressure monsoon trough is here. It also ended the break monsoon condition. The mercury will remain below seasons average, however, there are chances of another spell of dry and warm days for three to four days from August 24 onwards as the monsoon trough line will shift back to the Himalayan foothills. The region may thus see a temporary break monsoon condition for a few days,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.Noida last recorded received rain on August 9, which was low intensity. On Friday, India Meteorological Department (IMD) recorded a maximum and minimum temperature of Noida at 31.1°C and 27.7°C against 37.1°C and 28°C a day earlier.At Safdarjung monitoring station, considered average for the national Capital region, the maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded at 32.8°C, a degree below the season’s average and 27.3°C, a degree above season’s average. The humidity oscillated between 97 and 70%.“On Saturday, the maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to hover around 32 and 27°C,” said an official from IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/monsoon-breaks-pause-with-light-rain-in-noida-101629483664852.html
20-08-2021||Noida||GB Nagar District Magistrate all set to represent India at Tokyo Paralympics||District magistrate (DM) of Gautam Budh Nagar Suhas L Y, who is also an international level para-badminton player, is all set to represent India in badminton at the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games scheduled to be held between August 24 and September 5. He will leave for Tokyo on August 28. Suhas will be seen in action from September 2 in the men’s singles Standing Lower 4 category---players in this class must play standing. Players in this class could have impairment (less than SL-3) in one or both lower limbs and minimal impairment in walking/running balance.With his eyes set on the gold medal, the DM hopes that the country gets to see him play in the finals on September 5. “While I am preparing to give my best, I do not think about the past or future, winning or losing during the match. At that moment, I am playing to score that one point and take each set as it comes. I believe that it is not the preparation but how you perform during the match is all that counts,” said Suhas, who is a 2007 batch IAS from Uttar Pradesh cadre. He took charge as the district magistrate of GB Nagar on March 31 last year. When asked how he finds time to train for competitions while being an administrative head of a district, he said, “I generally train for around two hours post 10pm after all my meetings and assessments of the day are over. For the Paralympics, I have been training at the Shaheed Vijay Pathik Sports Stadium in Greater Noida. This is not new for me as I have been training for competitions alongside my duties as an officer for six years now”.From passing orders during the day to taking orders from his coach by evening, the district magistrate turns student at night to prepare for the competition. Talking about his entry into international games as a badminton player, Suhas, who had an affliction in childhood that left him physically challenged, said he had been a public servant for nine years when he first thought of playing internationally. “I was the Azamgarh DM in 2016 when a state badminton championship was being held there and I was invited to inaugurate it. As the event was on, I expressed my desire to have a playful match because I had been playing badminton as a hobby. However, I was able to defeat the state-level players there. That is when Gaurav Khanna, who is the current head coach of the Indian para-badminton team, spotted me and asked me to try playing professionally. At the time I refused but about four months later, I decided to give it a shot and went on to play Badminton Asia Championship in China the same year, and got a gold medal for India,” said Suhas. The DM made history by becoming the world’s first unranked player to win a gold medal at the Asian Championship in Beijing in 2016. After this, Suhas went on a medal-winning spree at various international badminton competitions. He won gold at the BWF Turkish Open Para-Badminton Championship held in Turkey in 2017 and then again at Turkish Open Para-Badminton Championships in 2019. The last match that brought him a gold was the Brazil Para Badminton International Championships in Sao Paulo in February last year. Sharing his experience as a specially-abled public officer and an international player, Suhas said his parents taught him to never be insecure of his shortcomings. “Fortunately, I never faced any sort of discrimination because I have always tried to overcome my shortcomings by being the best in whatever I do. Up till Class 10, I was feted with the all-rounder award for being good in sports as well as academics. Later in the IAS academy too, I was given the honour of being an all-rounder. My parents always taught me that every person has one or the other shortcoming and that no one has it all. The only difference is someone’s shortcomings are visible physically, others’ might not,” said Suhas. He added that playing badminton is a spiritual activity for him and he hopes to make his country proud in the Tokyo Paralympics.This year’s Olympics challenging for players, says Deputy Chef de MissionMeanwhile, India’s Deputy Chef de Mission Arhan Bagati, who is in Tokyo with the first and second batch of Paralympics contingent, said due to Covid-19, a year’s gap in holding Tokyo Paralympics became a challenge for the players.“The players had been preparing for the Tokyo Paralympics since 2016. When Covid came, their training and preparations were disturbed. As a result, this year’s games are extremely challenging for each player,” said the 22-year-old, who is the youngest deputy CDF at the Tokyo Olympics. Bagati said he expects the Indian players at the Paralympics to get over 10 medals, including four gold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-district-magistrate-all-set-to-represent-india-at-tokyo-paralympics-101629483605429.html

It will benefit residents along the Expressway and also those, who have their offices in sectors 96, 97, 98, 99, 94, 125, 126, 127 and 128 etc,” said Rajeev Tyagi, chief general manager of Noida Authority who inspected the work on Friday . Tyagi directed the staff to make sure that the normal traffic in the area is not disrupted during construction. The underpass is expected to provide smooth commute in the area that has several multinational corpoartions, educational institutions and residential areas. The Noida Authority plans to shift their main administrative to Sector 96 next year and this is expected to increase traffic volume in the area.. Work on the four-lane project started on March 17, 2020. It will be 715 meters long and is being built at a cost of ₹99.34 crore. “Currently many newly built office buildings and housing towers in the area are yet to be occupied. Once that happens, we expect the traffic to increase. Without the underpass, there could be heavy congestion as more vehicles will attempt to cross from one side of the Noida Expressway to the other,” said Tyagi. Residents said that the underpass was the need of the hour in this region, where population will increase once occupancy level in newly built housing complexes in sector 94, 96, 97 and other adjoining areas will increase. “The underpass will be of immense benefit to commuters and those living in these sectors along Noida-Greater Noida Expressway. The authority should make sure it opens on schedule without delay,” said Pratap Singh, a resident of Raipur area, sector 127.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/underpass-at-noida-sector-44-to-be-opened-by-yearend-101629483544909.html
20-08-2021||Mumbai||Rashmi Shukla’s report: HC quizzes Maharashtra govt’s refusal to give evidence to CBI||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday questioned the Maharashtra government over its refusal to handover Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Rashmi Shukla’s 2020 report on corruption in police transfers and postings in the state to the Central Bureau Of Investigation (CBI).CBI has included the topic of the report – prepared by Shukla last year when she was the commissioner of the state intelligence department – in its ongoing probe against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, and has moved an application before HC, complaining about the state government’s refusal to handover certified copies of the report, related documents and other materials collected by the IPS officer.The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar has now asked senior advocate Rafiq Dada – who represented the state – to inform the court on August 24 as to which documents was the government willing to handover to CBI. The bench, however, said that the central agency cannot decide relevancy of the material without assessing it.The central agency has sought a direction to the state government to handover the report’s copy and other related documents for probe in the corruption case registered against Deshmukh on April 21.The state government had opposed the plea contending that CBI’s request was vague and does not explain how the documents are relevant for its probe. Additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi argued on behalf of CBI that the refusal to part with the material was nothing but contempt of HC’s July 22 order, by which the court had dismissed a petition filed by the Maharashtra government, seeking to drop the topic of Shukla’s report and reinstatement of controversial police officer Sachin Vaze in service.CBI registered the offence after former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh on March 20 wrote an explosive letter to the chief minister, alleging that as home minister, Deshmukh had on number of occasions summoned some officers at his official bungalow and told them that they had a target of collecting ₹100 crore from bars and other establishments in the city.The central agency has included the topic of Shukla’s report and reinstatement of Vaze in the purview of its probe in the case against Deshmukh and had sought the documents for investigation. The evidence includes materials pertaining to phone tapping and other digital proof which was seized on the basis of which Shukla’s report was made.Shukla had purportedly tapped phones between July 17 and July 29, 2020, after a number of complaints were received at various levels in the police department and in Mantralaya that some persons were acting as conduits for senior officers to secure transfers at desired places and plum postings by paying the then home minister and one “Dada” from the power circle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rashmi-shukla-s-report-hc-quizzes-maharashtra-govt-s-refusal-to-give-evidence-to-cbi-101629483486631.html

According to police, the arrested man, identified as Rahul, committed two back-to-back burglaries at night in the Dwarka area in the last one week for money to please his female friend. The police team caught him before he could burgle another house with his friend. Police said that on Independence Day, their teams received an alert about one of the accused men and they quickly swung to action. While on patrolling duty, the team apprehended Rahul. A case under relevant sections was registered at the Dwarka north police station and stolen items like necklaces, chains, bangles and rings were received from his possession.Rahul told police that his friend Sanchit was also involved in the burglaries. He later revealed that he robbed his own sister’s house in east Delhi’s Trilokpuri so as to be able to give his girlfriend something on their next date. An FIR regarding the burglary was registered at Trilokpuri four days ago, said police. Police said besides the purpose of giving something to his girlfriend, Rahul also purchased drugs after selling off the smaller gold items. The other burglary was in the Kakrola area. “We have started investigating the matter.

The Green Corridor project has been conceptualised to connect two ends of the city through a four-lane road. It is expected to ease traffic movement and cut down travel time from one part of the city to another from an hour to 15 minutes. The corridor will connect Hardoi Road, Sitapur Road, Old Lucknow and Khadra with Gomti Nagar. The development authority has identified 45 acres land for this project. The LDA has added this project in feasibility report of the Green Corridor and will add it in the detailed project report (DPR). Now, Tata Consultant Engineers, the consultant of the project, will present its report detailing expenses and expected income from the commercial hubs. According to LDA officials, these commercial hubs will be developed in two phases- eight in first and three in second. The officials further said the authority has estimated to earn around ₹10,800 crore from sale of residential and commercial properties along the corridor. Of this, ₹2700 crore income has been estimated from sale of residential properties and ₹8100 crore from commercial properties. Construction work for the first phase will start from October, said officials adding that separate detailed project reports will be prepared for all phases. LDA secretary will be the nodal officer and facilitate coordination with other departments for execution of the project. It may be pointed out that industrial clusters will also come up along other expressways. The state government has got approval from the Centre to develop industrial clusters in Agra and Prayagraj. The Yogi Adityanath government had sought nod from the Centre to allow development of two Integrated Manufacturing Clusters (IMCs) at a greenfield site near Saraswati Hi-Tech City in Prayagraj and near expressway in Agra. These clusters will come up along the 1839-km long Amritsar-Kolkata Industrial Corridor (AKIC) whose 57 percent is in Uttar Pradesh.

20-08-2021||Mumbai||Being made scapegoat: IPS officer Rashmi Shukla in Bombay HC in phone tapping case||Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Rashmi Shukla on Friday claimed before the Bombay high court (HC) that she was being made a scapegoat.The bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar was hearing her petition for quashing of the first information report (FIR) registered by the cyber cell in the case of alleged illegal phone tapping and leaking of her 2020 report over corruption in police transfers and postings.Shukla, the then head of the state intelligence department (SID), said, “I am an upright officer. I was shunted out in an illegal manner from SID commissioner’s post without following any proper procedure because I had made the report.”The case – registered on March 26 – was triggered after opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis, in an interview to a television channel on March 23, cited the report and corruption in transfers, Jethmalani told the bench.“I had got sanctions from time to time from additional chief secretary Sitaram Kunte from July 17 to July 29, 2020, to carry out the phone tappings. I had managed to bring to light the nexus between brokers and others assigning postings to police officers, and the fact that nine of them had actually got the postings,” she said.“I was abruptly transferred on September 2 without following due procedure as director general of police (civil defence). There was no office neither any staff allotted. The state has made nine DGP posts without permission from home affairs or approval from the state cabinet,” Shukla further stated.She alleged that Kunte is trying to “exonerate” himself. “Despite having all the permissions to carry out the tappings, I am now been made a scapegoat. A report by Kunte already blames me and further states that I accepted my mistake before him and told him that my husband had died due to cancer and my children were still studying. This is a lie. I had only told him that if there was a problem, I was ready to withdraw my report. My husband died in 2018, I am even ready to undergo a lie detector test, provided others are also willing to take it to bring out the truth,” the IPS officer submitted through her lawyer.“I have done nothing wrong in my job as SID commissioner and duly followed my duty, and if the state thought there was nothing in my report, why was it reluctant to share it with Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), that is demanding it,” she questioned.The bench, while continuing the protection from arrest to Shukla, has posted the matter for Saturday, when the state government is likely to argue on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/being-made-scapegoat-ips-officer-rashmi-shukla-in-bombay-hc-in-phone-tapping-case-101629483185423.html

These cloverleaves (loops) of the Mayur Vihar-I flyover will be inaugurated by the Chief Minister (Arvind Kejriwal) on August 28,” a senior Public Works Department (PWD) official told PTI on condition of anonymity. He said that the time of the inauguration ceremony is yet to be decided.The 800-metre-long flyover was constructed by the PWD and was opened for traffic in January 2019 but its loops, which were to provide seamless connectivity to Mayur Vihar -I and to Delhi, were under construction. The official said the construction of cloverleaves was over long back but its opening was delayed due to the Covid pandemic and also because of streetscaping of a small portion of the road beneath the flyover.At present, the road beneath the flyover is closed because of construction activities hence motorists have to take detours to reach destinations in central and New Delhi.Commuters going to Mayur Vihar-I from Noida have to travel nearly a kilometre extra to take a U-turn from underneath the NH-24 flyover. Similarly, vehicles destined to Akshardham from Mayur Vihar-I have to travel around a kilometre towards Noida to take a U-turn from underneath another flyover on the Link Road.The officials said that these problems will be solved after cloverleaves of the flyover are opened. One loop will allow the traffic coming from Noida to come down from the flyover and drive towards Mayur Vihar-I. The other will start from Mayur Vihar-I side and join the flyover towards Akshardham. The length of each cloverleaf will be 300 metre.“The delay occurred because of the construction work that slowed down due to restrictions on construction activities first due to rising pollution levels in winters and then shortage of material due to COVID-19 restrictions,” the official said. Another Public Works Department (PWD) official also said that some portion of the Link Road has also been widened near the flyover to accommodate extra traffic.

He had tested positive for Covid-19 in the second half of November 2020,” said Prof Surya Kant, HoD, respiratory medicine, KGMU.The other case was of a man who had tested positive for Covid-19 in April 2021. He came to the clinic complaining of excessive weakness.“I am getting eight to 10 cases of post-Covid-19 trouble and these patients have had Covid-19 at least six months ago. Some even nine months before,” said Surya Kant, who is running the post-Covid-19 clinic at KGMU, which is the only one of its type in the state.There are three main categories of post-Covid-19 trouble that patients coming to the clinic face. “In all, 50% have trouble in the lungs, 30% have sleeplessness or psychiatric problems and 20% come with excessive weakness and fatigue,” said Surya Kant.“Statistically, 70% patients fell ill with Covid-19 along with a positive test report, while 30% had symptoms but a negative test report. But both categories suffered similarly and even post-Covid-19 problems are the same,” said Surya Kant. KGMU had made three wards separately for presumptive Covid-19-positive patients.Doctors in the private sector say post-Covid-19 trouble depends upon the intensity of the infection people suffered. “If the illness was severe the post-Covid-19 recovery is delayed and complications too stay for long, particularly among the 50-plus age group and those suffering with comorbidities, particularly diabetes,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary-general, Association of International Doctors.“Not just those who tested positive but even those who hadn’t tested positive face similar problems. The other category of patients is of those who had their CT score above 15. Such patients were also treated as presumptive Covid-19-positive cases and given similar medical care,” said Surya Kant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/post-covid-19-illness-can-trouble-for-months-says-doctor-who-heads-post-covid-clinic-at-kgmu-101629483065653.html
20-08-2021||Lucknow||Dengue fears: Mosquito larvae found in city areas, govt machinery, hosps get active||After mosquito larvae were spotted at different locations in the state capital – raising fears of dengue – hospitals have started making preparations in advance to treat dengue patients.“We are yet to admit any dengue patient. But yes, we have prepared a separate dengue ward of 20 beds to cater to any patient who may contract dengue,” said Dr SC Sundriyal, director of the Civil Hospital.The health department has intensified checking inside houses and offices along with big complexes to detect presence of mosquito larva.“In August, we issued notices to about 50 house owners after mosquito larvae were spotted on their campuses. In the process of screening houses, we have covered about 500 houses and it will continue for the next few weeks,” said Dr KP Tripathi, in-charge of vector-borne diseases in the state capital.“Many patients coming to the OPD in private hospitals complain of fever. It is important to control mosquito breeding before dengue can spread,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary-general Association of International Doctors.Doctors said apart from authorities, residents too need to contribute. “We can ensure that water does not stagnate in our houses and remove it to stop mosquito breeding,” said Dr Shukla.Apart from Civil Hospital, Balrampur Hospital too has made arrangements for treatment of dengue cases while other hospitals have alerted staff to ensure immediate treatment of such patients.Areas under scannerAreas such as Thakurganj, Chowk, Para, Rajajipuram, Aliganj, Gomti Nagar, Faizullahganj, Khadra, Triveni Nagar, Alambagh, Ashiana are under the scanner of the district authorities after mosquito larvae were found in these areas.District malaria department and Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) will run an awareness campaign for residents. The residents will be told not to allow stagnation of water inside houses, especially inside coolers, tyres or in drains. Those residents who will allow the collection of water on their premises will be penalised.Mayor Sanyukta Bhatia has directed municipal authorities to start fogging drives across the city. “At a time when residents are already suffering due to the pandemic, the municipal corporation cannot allow epidemics like diarrhoea, dengue, or malaria to hurt residents. That’s why regular fogging of city areas is important. I will also write to the malaria department to conduct anti-larvae drives in coordination with LMC so that the anti-larvae drive is followed by fogging for total elimination of mosquitoes in the area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/dengue-fears-mosquito-larvae-found-in-city-areas-govt-machinery-hosps-get-active-101629482825595.html

The decision was taken during central committee’s online meeting held earlier this month. “We will organise phase-wise protests in different parts of the state in September with our 15 different demands of increase in manufacture of Covid-19 vaccines, procure of vaccines from other nations, compensation for people who died due to the virus, employment for people and others,” said CPM secretary Goutam Das on Friday. On a different note, Das criticized BJP legislator Arun Chandra Bhowmik who sparked off controversy by asking his party activists to attack the Trinamool Congress leaders in Talibani style when they land at airport in Agartala. He also demanded legal action against another BJP legislator Biswabandhu Sen, also deputy speaker of Assembly who landed into controversy last week by saying that some government employees who sit on roads and complained of getting nothing, their bones should be broken. “We demand legal action against both the legislators,” said Das.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tripura-cpm-to-start-month-wide-protests-from-september-on-15-point-demand-101629482648604.html
20-08-2021||Lucknow||Central oxygen system not operational at Agra hospital even after 10 years: CAG report||In its audit report, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has said the lackadaisical approach of the Uttar Pradesh medical health and family welfare department resulted in unfruitful expenditure of ₹1.88 crore on the procurement of a central oxygen system (COS) for the Agra district hospital which could not be made operational even after a lapse of more than 10 years.Uttar Pradesh parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna tabled the report on the general and social sector for the year ending March 31, 2019, in the state assembly on Thursday. The scrutiny of records of the office of the superintendent-in- chief at the Agra district hospital (male) revealed that the UP government had sanctioned ₹2.76 crore in 2010 and ₹2.70 crore in 2011 for the procurement of equipment and materials to upgrade the medical facilities in the same hospital, according to the report.Nevertheless, the COS remained non-operational even after a decade, the report added.When Covid patients were hit hard by oxygen crisis during the second wave (April- May), the state government transported oxygen from various parts of the country to maintain the stock in hospitals. Hundreds of attendants were seen in queues outside filling stations to get medical gas for their family members battling Covid-19 in hospitals at that time.The CAG report showed that even after investment, government hospitals remained ill-equipped in terms of oxygen supply.The CAG report also observed that the Agra district hospital invited tenders and executed an agreement with two firms in March 2010 and February 2012 for the supply of various equipment, including central oxygen system (COS) for 50-bed and 60-bed wards. The COS was supplied by the firms at a cost of ₹0.83 crore and ₹1.29 crore respectively.The agreement executed by the Agra district hospital with the suppliers did not incorporate a clause for the release of payment on the successful installation and commissioning of the oxygen system, the report noted.The hospital made a payment of ₹2.12 crore to the supplier after installation of the equipment. The hospital staff were not trained to run the COS, nor it was made operational, the report said.The security deposit made by the suppliers could not be forfeited as it was taken in a non-recognized form through cheques, it said.Later, the director general medical and health services (DGMHS), Uttar Pradesh, directed the Agra district hospital to submit the particulars of the superintendents of hospitals, who were posted during 2009-12 and 2016-17 for action over irregularities committed in the installation of the COS.In May 2017, the then Agra district magistrate wrote a letter to both the suppliers to make the COS operational. Only one supplier submitted a revised estimate of ₹3.61 lakh to make the COS operational. The amount was not released by DGMHS.The state government, during discussion in December 2017, accepted the audit observation and assured investigation to fix responsibilities to check recurrence of such situations in the future. The information regarding action taken by the state government is still awaited, the report said.The CAG stated that expenditure of ₹1.88 crore on COS had been rendered unfruitful. The COS was lying non- functional, and the hospital continued to depend on small cylinders to maintain oxygen supply to the wards, it said.3,339 purchase orders not executedThe CAG audit report noted that a scrutiny of the records of chief medical officers (CMOs) and chief medical superintendents (CMSs) of 11 districts during August 2016 and September 2017 revealed that 3,339 purchase orders valued at ₹37.37 crore and placed to 374 suppliers remained unexecuted even after lapse of 60 days from their placement. The purchase orders were automatically cancelled.Accordingly, as per conditions of supply, liquidated damage at the rate of 20% and 15 % on the value of unexecuted orders amounting to ₹6.21 crore were required to be recovered from the suppliers. No liquidated damages were recovered except ₹4.47 lakh by CMO, Bareilly. There was an undue benefit of ₹6.17 crore to the suppliers, CAG observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/central-oxygen-system-not-operational-at-agra-hospital-even-after-10-years-cag-report-101629482645596.html
20-08-2021||Mumbai||New engineering colleges fewer than those allowed to shut across India||The process of approval of new institutes recently ended at the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and for the first time in nearly half a decade, the number of new institutes is lower than the number of institutes allowed to shut shop for the 2021-22 academic year. This also meant that the intake capacity in engineering colleges across the country stands at its lowest in the past 10 years. From 15.48 lakh approved intake capacity in engineering institutes, the number this year stands at 12.86 lakh across 2,978 institutes around the country.In its second year, the blanket ban on new engineering institutes seems to have finally achieved what the experts had aimed to—less number of seats that focus on better infrastructure and quality of education. “Engineering was losing its sheen mainly because of colleges mushrooming across the country but not having enough back-up to ensure quality education, best teachers and proper placement after graduation. While the intake capacity is low compared to 10 years ago, we hope the quality of education imparted in existing colleges is better than ever,” said Anil Sahasrabuddhe, chairman, AICTE. In December 2020, nearly 60% of engineering seats in West Bengal institutes were vacant after three rounds of admissions. Similarly, nearly 75% of seats in Tamil Nadu engineering institutes were vacant after three admission rounds, whereas in Karnataka, colleges approached the AICTE for an extension in the admission deadline to fill up the over 50% vacant seats in the last week of December 2020. “In most states, seat vacancy is higher in private engineering institutes especially because of the high fees demanded and the low quality of education imparted,” said the dean of a government-run engineering institute in the city. With the implementation of the two-year blanket ban on new engineering institutes, AICTE this year approved the closure of 63 institutes, while 32 institutes applied for withdrawal of approval and a staggering 500 institutes around the country did not apply for continuation of approval for 2021-22 academic year. “New institute approvals have only been allowed in districts with not enough government-funded engineering institutes, to give aspirants in such districts the option of studying closer to home. In the last two years, only government-funded new institute approvals have been accepted to ensure engineering seats are affordable for students,” added Sahasrabuddhe. Lack of proper placement initiatives and falling demand for engineering graduates in the market meant fewer students aiming for BTech courses. Until 2014-15 number of new engineering colleges was higher than those shutting down, automatically hinting at an increase in total intake capacity. From 17.04 lakh seats in 3,398 colleges, the numbers kept dipping with every passing year and in 2021-22, there are now 2,978 engineering institutes with an intake capacity of 12.86 lakh, the lowest in almost a decade.Similarly, admissions to premier IITs depends on the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Mains score and while in 2013 nearly 14 lakh students had registered for the entrance test, less than nine lakh have the exam in 2018.However, attribute it to ban on new colleges or the change in the perception of students, but technical courses are slowly once again gaining popularity among students. After witnessing a decline in the overall enrolment in professional courses, especially engineering and technology, things seem to look better. As per the latest All Indian Survey of Higher Education (AISHE) 2019-20 report, BTech and MTech programs witnessed a marginal rise after hitting a four-year low in 2018-19. The enrolment for MTech in 2018-19 stood at 1,35,500 and the same in 2019-20 stood at 1,37,051. Similarly, enrolment for the BTech program stood at 21,25,043 and in 2019-20, the figure stood at 21,47,962. Many felt the decision of the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) to encourage the introduction of new-age courses like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data Science and Robotics in technical colleges could be the main reason for this push. “In 2020-21, Electronics and Communication sector managed to swoop the best of the minds and many also opted for BTech in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science fields. Since jobs in the electronics as well as AI sectors are gaining more popularity, students too are very clear about their ambition and aiming for seats in specific departments,” said Gopakumaran Thampi, principal of Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Bandra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/new-engineering-colleges-fewer-than-those-allowed-to-shut-across-india-101629482585567.html
20-08-2021||Gurugram||Man held for frauds a former bank loan agent, knew all loopholes: Police||Investigation into the crimes allegedly committed by a 48-year-old former bank loan agent, who was arrested in Delhi on Thursday for allegedly duping people and transferring amounts from their account by linking his mobile number, revealed that he had expertise in the banking system and knew all loopholes, the police said.The suspect was identified as Praveen Mittal, of Haryana’s Sonepat, who lived in Gururgam and worked as a loan agent for several nationalised banks. The police said the suspect and his aides executed a series of banking frauds in at least three northern states, including fraud of ₹1.39 crore from the account of a farmer who had received compensation for land acquisition in Gurugram.Until a week ago, the police were clueless about the identity of the persons responsible and only had CCTV footage from a bank that was collected two years ago. To expedite the probe, the city police recently formed a special investigation team (SIT) under Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), to track the suspect and a reward of ₹5 lakh was announced on his arrest.In the past month, the police arrested six persons, Sanjeev Yadav, Hari Singh, Hitesh Goyal, Amit Chandana, Prem Kumar and Sachin Gupta, all residents of Delhi, in connection with the case but none of them was aware of the real identity of the kingpin. All of them were involved in issuing SIM cards without proper documentation for the crimes.The Nuh police had rounded up Mittal in Delhi and handed him over to the Gurugram police in connection with a fraud case registered in the city.The police said they were able to identify him through records of jails. “The breakthrough came from Faridabad jail, where Mittal was lodged last year and later released on bail. Mittal, along with six others, were arrested by the Faridabad police in 2020 in connection with a fraud and later released on bail. The police started checking the records of visitors who had met Mittal in jail. After questioning multiple persons, the police managed to get the WhatsApp number of Mittal,” said Sangwan.Sangwan said the suspect was absconding for the last two years and was also declared a bail jumper by the local court. He only communicated through WhatsApp.The police also booked a few bank officials in the frauds.“Mittal impersonating as farmer applied for changing the mobile number and it was done without proper verification. As per the number, the old mobile number received a notification about the update of new mobile number attached with the account, but the farmer did not receive any such message,” said Sangwan, adding that role of bank officials are still being probed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/man-held-for-frauds-a-former-bank-loan-agent-knew-all-loopholes-police-101629482525388.html
20-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai lake level crosses 85%, stock enough for 320 days||Water level in lakes supplying drinking water to Mumbai crossed 85% mark on Friday morning. The city now has water stock sufficient for next 320 days, according to civic officials.Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials said the city may not have any water cuts this year due to available water stock which is likely to last till next monsoon. A BMC official said, “The total lake levels going above 85-90% is considered to be safe, and hopefully we should not see any water cuts until next year for now.”However, the civic body will continue monitoring rainfall till mid-September. Of the seven lakes supplying drinking water to the city, four lakes — Tulsi, Vihar, Tansa and Modak Sagar — have already overflown once this monsoon. According to BMC’s data, the livestock of water is 100% in Tulsi and Vihar, followed by Tansa with 99% and Modak Sagar with 88% water.The seven lakes that supply water to the city are located in Mumbai as well as neighbouring Thane and Palghar districts. Between July 16 and July 23, the catchment areas of the lakes received maximum of its stock. On July 17, the overall water level in seven lakes was just 17% and the BMC was considering announcing water cut. However, by July 22, water level had crossed the 50% mark, followed by 60% on July 24 and 70% on July 28. Last year at this time, the water level was 87% and it was 94% in 2019.Bhatsa dam in Thane which supplies 55% of the total annual water requirement of the city has 83% water stock which was 85% last year at this time. In case of Upper Vaitarna, water level is 73% as of Friday. Last year at this time, the level stood at 71%. Middle Vaitarna has 91% of water stock as opposes to 93% last year at this time.The seven lakes are bifurcated into two systems —Vaitarna system which supplies to the western suburbs and the island city, and Bhatsa system which supplies to the eastern suburbs. The civic body supplies 3,850 million litres of water daily against the city’s demand for 4,200 million litres. In order to meet the shortfall, BMC has been exploring several ways to increase water supply to the city. A month ago, the civic body signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with an Israel-based firm for the city’s first desalination project at Manori in Malad. Under this project, BMC plans to turn seawater into drinking water, and the pilot project is expected to be ready by 2025.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-lake-level-crosses-85-stock-enough-for-320-days-101629482345500.html

The polyclinic staff was directed to resolve the issues within a week. According to a statement issued by the health department, CMO Dr Virender Yadav made the visit at 1:30 pm. “Some of the doctors were not on duty and one doctor did not mark attendance. A warning has been issued to all the staff that strict disciplinary action will be initiated if the mistake is repeated,” read the statement. Yadav took the complete round of the polyclinic and asked patients about the services at the hospital. “Electricity wires hanging out of place. The facility lacked cleanliness. There were multiple registration counters for vaccination and that confused beneficiaries. In the drug and vaccination store, items were not arranged properly. Instructions have been given to resolve the shortcomings within a week,” said Yadav. He instructed the staff to clean hospital premises frequently and open the second main door of the hospital. “The dispensary of the hospital which is located behind the hospital will be shifted to the front to increase visibility. Even the waiting areas for vaccination will be extended to avoid congestion. The medical officer of the hospital has been directed to display important government guidelines and instruction at the registration, pharmacy and vaccination sites,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/cmo-surprise-inspection-at-polyclinic-finds-several-shortcomings-101629482285393.html
20-08-2021||Mumbai||Reports of genome sequencing at Mumbai’s Kasturba hospital to come on Monday||Results of whole genome sequencing of the first batch of swab samples collected from Mumbai to identify mutations of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, will be available on Monday. On Friday, Byculla-based Kasturba Gandhi Hospital started genome sequencing, making it the first civic-run healthcare facility in Maharashtra to do so.Genome sequencing is an exercise to study the changes in the structure of virus over time. A combination of changes in the ribonucleic acid of the virus can give birth to a new variant.On Friday, a total of 192 samples were tested for genome sequencing at the hospital. The samples were collected through the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) from international passengers, Covid-19 hotspots, places with high transmission rate among others. In the next cycle, 384 samples will be tested.“We will get results of the first cycle on Monday. These tests have three phases. The first phase is library presentation which is also called pre-sequencing preparation. It takes two-three days. Then we do sequencing of samples in the machine which generally takes four to five hours. In the third stage, we analyse the results to understand the variations,” said Dr Jayanti Shastri, in-charge of molecular diagnostic reference laboratory of the hospital. “We started the first process on Tuesday but we loaded the samples for sequencing on Friday. It takes three-four days to get test reports,” she said.The machines were installed at the laboratory on August 3. For the past two weeks, the hospital was busy with installing and validating the machines. “After a lot of efforts, we have been able to start genome sequencing at the laboratory. We hope this will help in detecting Delta and Delta Plus variants faster and decrease our dependence on other laboratories,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair Hospital which runs the laboratory at Kasturba hospital. When asked if the laboratory will only test samples from Mumbai or the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), a senior health officer said, “We haven’t decided it yet, as the primary focus is to run tests on samples from Mumbai.”At present, 11 Delta Plus variants have been identified in the city with one death. Although the number is increasing, it has not contributed to any sudden rise in Delta Plus cases. The positivity rate of Mumbai stands below 1%. “What experience from across the world has consistently shown us is that when rates of vaccination are high, even if variants cause surges in infections, such infections tend to be of a milder nature and do not cause hospitalisations or deaths in a large scale. We also need to do our best to limit crowds as overcrowding has consistently led to spread over the past 18 months,” said Dr Lancelot Pinto, pulmonologist and epidemiologist from Hinduja hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/reports-of-genome-sequencing-at-mumbai-s-kasturba-hospital-to-come-on-monday-101629482165559.html
20-08-2021||Mumbai||ULCC model: A strategic shift or marketing gimmick?||Last month, the country’s leading stock trader, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala announced his plans to invest $35 million in a new ultra-low-cost carrier (ULCC) in India. The announcement to set up another ULCC comes at a time when both Indian full service and low-cost carriers are struggling to keep afloat in the wake of the pandemic. With demand for air travel plummeting, the creation of ULCC indicates a shift in both the business model and the domestic Indian aviation market that has witnessed a growth of low-cost carriers (LCCs) from 2000. Unlike LCC, a ULCC does not offer frills such as baggage or food in the ticket price. ULCCs, pioneered in Europe by Irish carrier Ryanair and in the US by Spirit, target passengers who want to reach their destinations by spending as little as possible. Jhunjhunwala’s proposed entity, when it comes up, would be the second ULCC in the domestic market. In May, the erstwhile GoAir announced its rebranding as GoFirst, including a change in business model from a low-cost carrier to ULCC.When contacted, Jhunjhunwala refused to comment. GoFirst did not respond to HT’s query.The Indian aviation industry has been facing major headwinds given the sharp contraction in travel demand due to the pandemic and high-fixed cost structure. This has resulted in a significant amount of cash burns and resultant losses. Ever since the outbreak of the pandemic in March last year, the industry continues to have a demand-supply mismatch due to the sharp decline in passenger traffic amid consumers’ hesitation to travel, restrictions by the government on permissible capacity deployment on domestic routes, suspension of scheduled international air services and quarantine norms of various state governments.“It is important for the airlines to contain costs and maintain liquidity to tide over this (situation). In such a scenario of excess supply and low demand, the entry of new players in the industry will only intensify the competition, further hampering the already weak pricing power of the airlines. This may negatively impact the yields, thereby worsening the revenue per available seat kilometre (RASK) and cost per available seat kilometre (CASK) spreads of the airlines,” said Kinjal Shah, vice president & co-group head - corporate sector ratings, ICRA Limited.According to reports, Jhunjhunwala’s Akasa Air, on the anvil since the end of 2020, is aiming to take off by the end of this year and has received a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Civil Aviation Ministry as well as the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to start an airline in the country. However, senior officials confirmed to HT that the airline is yet to get a NOC. “Contrary to reports, Akasa has not yet received NOC from the civil aviation ministry,” said the official.Reports also say that the proposed Akasa airline is in talks with the US aircraft maker Boeing to acquire up to 100 737 Max aircraft. The airline has also approached the government to recertify the grounded aircraft. At present, all Boeing 737 Max planes in India, which are only in budget carrier SpiceJet’s fleet are grounded since late March 2019 over safety concerns. According to an industry expert, the concept of LCC and ULCC is not clearly defined in India, unlike Europe or the USA. “In Europe and the USA, ULCCs define their space. For example, they never go to major airports like Frankfurt instead they go to Frankfurt- Hahn airport which is 70kms away. By doing so they reduce their cost massively. However, we don’t have such a concept in India hence there is no way they can differentiate,” he said.CS Subbiah, an aviation consultant and former chief executive officer (CEO) of Alliance Air, said all carriers have unbundled most of their services. “Except meal and executive class facilities, there is no major difference in India. I believe we have economy class airlines and airlines with two classes. Being cost-conscious and thrifty is a good thing in management parlance today. I believe in India ULCC is only a marketing gimmick but in real terms, they are the same as LCCs. They can’t pack more seats than the present six in a row. Maybe they can try and squeeze another row or more.”Subbiah added, “Any ULCC bringing in A320 or B737 aircraft will need to touch a metro or a major tier-II airport. Where is the cost difference as LCCs do the same? Both will offer similar fares to the same traveller. In India, I don’t see a major difference between an LCC and ULCC.”ULCC business model is to have a lower cost than traditional low-cost airlines- though in India due to structural cost challenges the reduction of cost is relatively marginal.“Akasa has the opportunity to design a very low-cost base compared to other LCCs. ULCC also means lower revenues and hence, ancillaries are fundamental to its success but in India, we have regulatory barriers related to ancillaries that need to be sorted out by Akasa. However, one can expect all the carriers to match Akasa fares irrespective of their cost base,” said Kapil Kaul, chief executive officer of Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA), India, an aviation firm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ulcc-model-a-strategic-shift-or-marketing-gimmick-101629482046473.html
20-08-2021||Gurugram||Red Cross secretary denied anticipatory bail in molestation case||A local court on Friday rejected the anticipatory bail application of the secretary of Red Cross Society who was booked for allegedly molesting a 35-year-old woman staffer of the organisation last week. Additional sessions judge Sashi Chauhan rejected the anticipatory bail on Friday as a serious allegation had been levelled against him. “He was directed to join the investigation,” said public prosecutor Jagbir Singh Sehrawat.The woman, in her complaint filed last week, alleged that she had met the secretary at an event organised by an NGO in Sohna on March 3 this year, when he shared his mobile phone number with her and told her to get in touch with him for a job. The woman is a law graduate.The following day, the woman allegedly met him at the Red Cross office in Gurugram and was offered the job of a counsellor within two days, following which he sexually harassed her, according to the complaint. The woman said that she confronted the accused, Shyam Sunder, along with the chairperson of another NGO, during which he claimed that the messages were sent by his servant. Refuting the allegations, Sundar on Friday said that he was transferred to Panchkula but was ready to join the investigation.He said that he was being framed and that the woman was trying to extort him. “The woman had approached me for a job. I helped her to get the job but she started threatening to frame me in a false rape case. She had demanded ₹20 lakh. The police can match the locations; I was not there at the location when she alleged (the incident took place),” he said. The woman had approached the deputy commissioner with her complaint and also submitted her resignation to the organisation.

20-08-2021||Mumbai||Daily Covid caseload dips below 5,000 in Maharashtra with 4,365 new cases||Maharashtra reported 4,365 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, marking a dip below 5,000 daily cases. Over the past few weeks, daily caseload in the state hovered around 5,200-5500. The total case tally now stands at 6,415,935 and the death toll at 135,672 after 105 deaths were reported on Friday.Mumbai reported 319 new cases and six deaths pushing tally to 740,608 and toll to 15,941.While most parts of the state decline in the cases, six districts accounted for 63.25% of the daily caseload and 56.51% of active cases on Friday. As many as 63.25% or 2,761 cases reported on Friday were from six of the 36 districts — Pune, Ahmednagar, Solapur, Kolhapur, Beed and Sangli. These districts also account for 56.51% or 31,339 of the total 55,454 active cases in the state. The state administration expects the high number of cases in these districts to fall in coming days and has directed the district administrations to go for aggressive tracing and testing of suspected contacts to keep the spread of the epidemic in check. Pune continues to report high number of cases and registered the highest cases at 882 on Friday. Three other Western Maharashtra districts — Ahmednagar, Solapur and Sangli — reported 614, 422 and 555 cases, respectively. Kolhapur and Beed logged 187 and 101 cases. Meanwhile, Satara reported the highest deaths at 17, followed by 11 each in Sangli and Solapur and 10 in Ratnagiri. “We have witnessed a fall in cases in some of the districts like Raigad, Palghar, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg over the past few weeks. Similarly, other districts which are still reporting a high number of cases are expected to see a downward trend in the next few weeks. Some of the districts which could have controlled the number of cases in the past few weeks have very weak health infrastructure. District administrations in Ahmednagar, Kolhapur and Sangli have good infrastructure, but lag in tracing, isolation and testing. They have been directed to not lower the guard,” said an official from health department.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, state government’s advisor on Covid-19, said, “Until the existing variant of virus does not mutate and is highly virulent, we can expect a fall in cases in the next two to four weeks even in the districts with high number of cases. The districts which are showing a high number of cases had late introduction of the virus and also do not have high intensity of surveillance. People are not following Covid-appropriate behaviour. On the other hand, the activities have been opened up. These factors could also lead to rise in the number of cases in near future.”The state has 55,454 active cases, including 12,558 in Pune, 7,022 in Thane and 6,658 in Satara. With 4,365 of the 206,848 tests turning positive on Friday, the daily positivity rate of the state was 2.11 %. State’s overall positivity rate stands at 12.36%, while case fatality rate stands at 2.11%.

20-08-2021||Mumbai||Marathas resume stir; will ensure quota is reinstated, says Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati||Demanding that their quota in government jobs and education be restored at the earliest, Maratha community outfits held agitation in Nanded on Friday. Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament (MP) Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, who is leading the agitation, said that both the state and Central government will have to take certain decisions to ensure Maratha reservation will be reinstated. He said that the Centre will have to remove the 50% cap on reservation quota mandated by the Supreme Court while the state government will have to ensure that the Maratha community is socially and educationally backward.Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati is a descendant of Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji and has taken a lead in providing reservation to the Maratha community after the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act 2018 — which was enacted by the state government to provide quota to the community — was quashed by the Supreme Court on May 5. The community is upset with the Apex court verdict and want it to be restored with immediate effect.Before this, Maratha outfits held agitations in Kolhapur and Nashik. “Both the state and the Central government are trying to shirk the responsibility by saying that the other will have to take the decision. The Centre is saying that they have made the 127th Amendment in the Constitution and it is on the state government to provide reservation. The state government has said that the Central government will have to remove the 50% cap on reservation quota. But the fact is both the governments [state and the Centre] will have to make certain decisions, only after which, Maratha community will get their reservation back,” Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati said while addressing a gathering in Nanded on Friday afternoon.The reservation of the state has currently reached 52%.“The Central government will have to ensure that the 50% cap on reservation quota is removed by the Apex court without which the state government cannot provide the reservation. The state government will also have to start the process to prove that the Maratha community is socially and educationally backward. We are not interested in the fighting between both the governments,” he added.A five-judge bench of the Apex court, in its ruling on May 5, struck down the SEBC Act, 2018, which extended 12% and 13% reservation to the Maratha community in education and employment respectively, above the ceiling limit of 50% fixed by the Supreme Court earlier. The 50% cap in the reservation was fixed in the Indra Sawhney judgment passed by a nine-judge bench.While quashing the SEBC Act, the bench had also ruled that states have no powers to grant reservation to socially and economically backward classes post 102nd Amendment in the Constitution. Following this, the Central government has moved a bill for the 127th Amendment in the Constitution to restore the right of the states to identify and provide reservation to the backward classes. The bill was approved by the Parliament on August 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/marathas-resume-stir-will-ensure-quota-is-reinstated-says-sambhajiraje-chhatrapati-101629481868563.html

Following trace rainfall on Friday, the maximum temperature was 29°C, five degrees below the normal, while the minimum was largely unchanged, at 25.6°C.The city witnessed light rain at scattered places from noon, with the rainfall recorded as trace, an amount of rainfall that is greater than zero but too little to be measured.The temperature is likely to drop further by Sunday, as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a “yellow alert” weather warning, predicting heavy rain with thunderstorms, lightning and squall. According to the weekly forecast of IMD, one or two spells of rain or thundershowers are likely in the city till August 24.“Today (Friday), rain activity was lesser in Delhi-NCR, but the intensity is likely to pick up over the next two days. Temperatures have already reduced in the region, and we might see a further drop,” a senior IMD official said.Over the next four days, the maximum temperature in Gurugram is likely to be between 31-33°C, while the minimum temperature is likely to be around 27-29°C.Meanwhile, despite the rain, the air quality in the city did not improve and continued to remain in the moderate zone of the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily air quality bulletin for the fourth consecutive day.

20-08-2021||Gurugram||MCG gets nod to store C&D waste on five-acre plot opposite Basai plant||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) on Friday approved a request from the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) to store construction and demolition (C&D) waste on a five-acre plot opposite the Basai C&D plant. Citing public protest against sites identified by the MCG for the purpose, the MCG sought the GMDA’s help in this regard.The city produces at least 850 tonnes of C&D waste daily, most of which is dumped vacant plots and roadsides.On July 5, the MCG had issued a release stating that they had identified five sites — Sector 56, near Golf Course Road, Kadipur, Transport Nagar near Rajiv Chowk, Wazirabad near Golf Course Extension Road, and Sector 110 near Dwarka Expressway — for dumping C&D waste.However, residents protested against the same and moved the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in the matter, the MCG’s letter to the GMDA stated. The MCG has not stored any C&D waste at any of the five sites, the letter stated.“The biggest problem with the selection of the five sites was that they were in the middle of the city. A C&D waste dumping site, instead, needs to be away from habitat, which will have minimal impact on the environment and waste can be segregated and processed on site,” said Roma J Vinayak, a city-based environmentalist.MCG officials on Friday said that they received a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the GMDA to use their five-acre plot located opposite the Basai plant for storage purposes. The letter, written by MCG’s executive engineer for Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), Sunder Sheoran, mentioned that the matter was discussed in a meeting at the office of Sudhir Rajpal, the chief executive officer of GMDA, on August 10.“The MCG has received a NOC from the GMDA and we are in the process of completing the lease formalities. Storage of C&D waste will commence next month. The MCG will construct a boundary wall around this site and give it back to GMDA if the land is required for any public utility,” said Sheoran.Sheoran said that the Basai C&D plant has also reached its full capacity and the processing capacity is likely to be increased as the GMDA has made the plot available to them.“Currently, the plant is processing around 300 tonnes of C&D waste daily. The MCG has formed a five-member committee to examine the ways it can increase its capacity, one of which included additional space to store C&D waste,” said Sheoran.According to MCG officials, the Basai C&D plant has a maximum capacity of processing 1,800 tonnes of C&D waste per day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-gets-nod-to-store-c-d-waste-on-five-acre-plot-opposite-basai-plant-101629481866452.html
20-08-2021||Gurugram||GMDA to promote treated water use at construction sites||After using treated water in green belts, officials of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) are planning to promote the use of treated water at construction sites, as part of an initiative to conserve water in the city.The chief executive officer of GMDA, in a meeting on Tuesday, instructed officials concerned to find out ways for best utilisation of treated water.“As per norms, treated water should be used by builders at construction sites, but this does not happen always as the water needs to be filled in tankers and taken to the site. Under this initiative, around 200 hydrants are likely to be installed with new pipelines and their locations will be shared on the website, so people know the nearest hydrant,” a senior GMDA official said, not wishing to be named.However, real estate developers in the city said that due to water scarcity, treated water is already being used.“It is difficult as we have to hire tankers specially to take water from government sites, but as there is shortage of water, treated water is being used at construction sites. It adds on to the cost with fuel charges as water is required frequently. We cannot say for sure how this initiative will help as water would still have to be collected by tankers from designated sites,” said Kamaljeet Singh, vice president of Bestech Ltd, a city-based developer. The urban environment division of the GMDA is planning to install lateral lines of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes along with hydrants to supply treated water. These hydrants would be installed with a spacing of 30 metres and pipes are set up using trenchless technology, a method used for installing or replacing pipelines with minimum disruption to the surface.“These hydrants are to be made specially in the sectors where the construction is going on and the builders may be made aware to use this water by fixing signboards,” the GDMA chief had said in the meeting.Officials from the infrastructure II division said that a list of priority locations will be sought from the urban environment division for the project.“We already have pipelines for treated sewage water laid on stretches like Sector 44 to Subhash Chowk, Bakhtawar Chowk, but these lines are on one side, either right or left. As green belts can be on either side of the roads and also in the centre, this network will be expanded to help other uses also,” a senior official of the infrastructure II division said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gmda-to-promote-treated-water-use-at-construction-sites-101629481865470.html
20-08-2021||Chandigarh||Abandoned by father, infant with rare birth defect discharged from Ludhiana hospital||It takes a village to raise a child: this time-tested adage was proven right when large-hearted anonymous benefactors and talented doctors pitched in to provide an infant, who was born with a rare defect, a new lease of life. For 22-year-old Aarti, , a resident of Laxmi Nagar, the world collapsed around her ears, the day her daughter was born as the infant’s intestines were hanging outside the body. Doctors at the private hospital where she was born told the child’s father that the defect would require an expensive rectifying procedure, which could only take place at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh. This was enough for Aarti’s husband, who sells rags, to wash his hands of the matter and abandon his newborn. However, Aarti and her mother-in-law did not resign to their fate and took her to Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), the next day. “The patient was a day old when she was rushed to the neonate ward of our hospital on June 24 with a diagnosis of gastroschisis, which is a rare congenital abdominal wall defect with a high mortality, in which the intestines hang outside the abdominal cavity at birth,” Dr Vishal Micheal of the department of paediatric surgery at CMC said, adding that Aarti had no money to even prepare a file, let alone pay for surgery when she came to the hospital. The doctors decided to start an online campaign, requesting residents to donate for the surgery, which even when performed free-of-charge would cost ₹3 lakh. Donations poured in and after spending 55 days at the hospital, the infant was discharged on Friday. Dr William Bhatti, director of the hospital, who led the team who led the surgical team, said, “The department of paediatric surgery at CMC, Ludhiana, has been performing all kinds of surgeries in children less than 18 years of age since 1972. The department has been equipped with state-of-the-art facilities for performing minimally invasive neonatal surgeries. This is the only department in Punjab, which is successfully running a maternal and child health programme in paediatric surgery.”The doctors said one in 10,000 children suffer from such abnormalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/abandoned-by-father-infant-with-rare-birth-defect-discharged-from-ludhiana-hospital-101629481806085.html

Thackeray, who participated in the meeting convened by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on Friday evening, spoke of fighting together against the ruling party in the country to save the democracy, senior Sena leader Sanjay Raut said. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, who also attended the virtual meeting, called for time-bound efforts by the Opposition parties to deal with the issues the country is reeling under. He also suggested collectively prioritising the issues and resolving them one by one.Gandhi met 19 Opposition leaders in a virtual meeting and asked them to unite and fight the 2024 elections. During the meeting, Gandhi said that the monsoon session of the Parliament saw “determined unity” of all Opposition parties. She, as per the statement from the party, said that the unity has to be sustained in the Parliament but there was a “larger political battle has to be fought outside it”.Raut, who was also a part of the meeting said, “Uddhav ji said that the unity among the Opposition parties must remain intact. Besides that, he said that we have to give people the confidence that the political parties that have come together will remain united.

Those who believe in democracy and secularism; those who like to work together to save the democratic principles and ethos of our country must come together. A time-bound action programme needs to be taken up collectively and I strongly suggest that instead of dealing with all these issues together, we must collectively prioritise each issue and solve them one by one to give our country a good present and future,” he said in a series of tweets posted after the meeting.Pawar led NCP is one of the three ruling parties in Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government led by Uddhav Thackeray.

20-08-2021||Other||Quota benefits to stay even after bifurcation of states, rules SC||New Delhi The Supreme Court has held that bifurcation of states will not result in persons already employed under reserved categories to be deprived of their benefits in the newly formed state.The Court was dealing with a case resulting from bifurcation of Bihar and Jharkhand in November 2000 where a scheduled caste candidate, born in undivided Bihar, was declared a migrant by Jharkhand and denied reservation benefits.A bench of Justices UU Lalit and Ajay Rastogi noted that the caste to which the petitioner Pankaj Kumar belonged was recognized as a Scheduled Caste in both Bihar and Jharkhand. Pankaj was born in Hazaribagh in 1974 which came under Jharkhand after the passing of the Bihar Reorganization Act, 2000.The bench said, “It will be highly unfair and pernicious if the benefits of reservation are not being protected in the State of Jharkhand... Section 73 of the 2000 Act clearly postulates not only to protect the existing service conditions but the benefit of reservation and privileges which he was enjoying on or before the appointed day, i.e. 15th November, 2000, in the State of Bihar not to be varied to his disadvantage after he became a member of service in the State of Jharkhand.”Kumar was appointed as assistant teacher in December 1999 in Ranchi. Upon bifurcation of Bihar, he opted to work as an employee of the Jharkhand government. In 2008, he applied as an SC candidate for the Combined Civil Service Examination advertised by Jharkhand government, got selected but was denied appointment on the ground that his service book showed him as a permanent resident of Patna and denied him job on the ground that he was a migrant in Jharkhand.The apex court noted that such a matter involving reservation benefits being denied as a result of bifurcation was arising for the first time. Laying down the law, the bench said, “... such employees shall remain protected by virtue of Section 73 of the Act 2000 for all practical purposes which can be claimed (including by their wards) for participation in public employment.”The Court was assisted by Attorney General KK Venugopal, who said that a government order of February 1985 generally lays down the law that reserved category candidates will be entitled to claim benefits within their home state and not in the state to which they have migrated. But here it was not a case of voluntary or involuntary migration but bifurcation, he argued. He said such class of persons (as the petitioner) would not be considered as migrants to Jharkhand. He also clarified that reservation benefits could be claimed only in one state and not both states, which the court too reiterated.The top court set aside the high court judgment and directed the Jharkhand government to appoint Kumar on the post he was selected for in 2008. He will be entitled to seniority as per his placement in the order of merit with notional pay and allowances but not back wages.The court also heard a batch of separate appeals filed by six candidates of SC/ST/OBC categories who were appointed as Constables in Jharkhand but were removed from service in June 2008 on the ground that they were migrants in the successor state. On merits, the apex court found they were indeed migrants as they had no proof of how long they were staying in Jharkhand and failed to produce their caste certificate at the time of appointment.But the Court used its extraordinary powers and directed their reinstatement as undeniably, they belonged to the SC/ST/OBC category in the undivided Bihar and had already served for a period of three to four years as constables with Jharkhand police. Having lost 13 years in litigation, it would be hard for them to secure employment at this later stage, the bench observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/quota-benefits-to-stay-even-after-bifurcation-of-states-rules-sc-101629480005413.html

On Friday, he reached the residence of their mother and former chief minister Rabri Devi in Patna, where Tejashwi is staying. However, within minutes, he was out of the house visibly angry and told reporters that Sanjay Yadav, who is considered close to Tejashwi, did not allow him to talk to him. “He is coming between two brothers. He interrupted our conversation,” Tej Pratap alleged. “While I was meeting Tejashwi, Sanjay Yadav walked in and took him to another room. Who is he to stop two brothers from meeting?” he said.Meanwhile, Jagdanand Singh, talking to reporters, advised party leaders not to cross the line and said Tej Pratap is not a member of the core committee of the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rjd-crisis-tej-pratap-storms-out-of-brief-meeting-with-tejashwi-101629479885437.html
20-08-2021||Other||Delhi ISP firm in dock over operations in Bihar||PATNAThe Bihar and Jharkhand field office of the department of telecommunication (DoT) is set to recommend to its head office to revoke the licence of a Delhi-based internet service provider (ISP), having licence for Delhi NCR, after it found operating in Bihar through local agencies, telecom officials have said. The firm in question, IPNET Communications Private Limited, has denied it was providing internet services anywhere across the country, except Delhi NCR, for which it had “category B” ISP licence. “We didn’t operate anywhere under the company banner of IPNET Communications (P) Ltd. We were operating only in Bettiah with the name of IPNET under the company banner IPNET Broadband Network (P) Ltd, which has ‘category A’ ISP licence (VNO),” said the firm’s director Prateek Shukla, in an e-mailed response to the Hindustan Times on Friday. A virtual network operator or VNO is an entity that does not own a complete telecom network infrastructure but provides telecom services by purchasing capacity from network service operators (NSOs). While “category A” ISP licence allows a firm to operate across the country, “category B” licence limits the operation to a particular geographical area mentioned in the licence. The DoT, however, said it had found evidence of the IPNET Communications Private Limited’s operation at Bettiah and Mirganj in Bihar’s West Champaran and Gopalganj districts, respectively. “We have found technical footprints of the ‘category B’ VNO licencee for Delhi area in Bihar since August last year. One of the local operators in Mirganj area of Gopalganj district has even given us a written statement that the firm had misled it and was providing internet services through it in the area for the last nine months,” said director (technology & security), DoT, Bihar, Krishna Nand Rai, who recently conducted raids on some local agencies in five districts of Bihar. Shukla, who is also the director of the IPNET Broadband Network, a sister concern of the IPNET Communications, claimed his firm began its internet services in Bettiah after getting the letter of intent from the government in April. The DoT has meanwhile, disconnected internet service of the local operators and initiated steps to blacklist them. “We will ask the Indian Registry for Internet Names and Numbers (IRINN), which allots IP addresses and other internet resources like domain name, to revoke the public IP (internet protocol) addresses of the Delhi-based ISP and the local operators. Besides, we will move our head office to revoke the ISP’s licence under Section 8 of the Telegraph Act,” said Rai. Companies without valid authority providing internet connection through local operators to individuals is a security risk as it becomes difficult for investigating agencies to establish the public IP address of the end user, said DoT officials. “We are also exploring how public IP addresses were allocated to the ISP, the local operators and their franchisees, who do not fulfil the conditions for grant of public IP. Misuse of IP is a security threat,” said Rai. “Even in case of the IPNET Broadband Network, which has a category A ISP licence (VNO), it cannot have its own public IP address. As per licence conditions for VNOs, it has to take IP address from its NSO. We will look into violations by this firm, if any, separately,” he said. Shukla avoided a direct response to Hindustan Times’ query if the IPNET Broadband Network was authorised to have its public IP address. “As per guidelines of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) and DoT related to ISP and their franchisee, it is mandatory to run end subscribers with proper public IP addresses through which internet logs can be examined easily. That’s why the National Internet Exchange of India sub-department IRINN allows IP addresses to franchisees also,” he said. Rai, however, said, “The Delhi-based VNO and local operators in Bihar cannot trade public IP address. Any such violation makes them liable to forfeit all the allocated internet resources and related rights by IRINN.” The DoT discovered the unholy nexus of unauthorised firms providing cheap data connection to households and commercial establishments during a raid on some local operators in Saran, Siwan, Gopalganj, East and West Champaran districts between August 13 and 15.“Such practice leads to loss of government revenue by way of evasion of taxes and licence fee, and also compromises national security,” said Rai. More such raids would follow, he added. Earlier, the Intelligence Bureau and DoT, in a joint operation in Patna on June 18, 2020 and July 20, 2021, had busted a racket of illegal routing of international data calls through mobile calls from local numbers. The raids had led to the arrest of four persons.Web of deceitIn the netSome local operators in Saran, Siwan, Gopalganj, East and West Champaran districts were raided between August 13 and 15 for providing cheap data connection to households and commercial establishments.DoT’s takeCompanies without valid authority providing internet through local operators is a security risk as it makes difficult for probe agencies to establish the public IP address of the end user. It also causes tax losses to government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-isp-firm-in-dock-over-operations-in-bihar-101629479765589.html

It will be linked to the upcoming the civilian airport at Bihta through an elevated corridor.The NHAI, which used to maintain Danapur-Bihta stretch of Patna-Ara road, handed over its possession to the RCD in June and asked to maintain it as per its requirement. The state government often locked horns with NHAI for maintenance of the road, as it was in the process of finalising new alignment of the NH30. RCD’s additional chief secretary Amrit Lal Meena said the department has proposed to develop the existing seven-metre road from Danapur to Bihta via Maner as a 10-metre wide boulevard with pavements in keeping with future traffic load on it. “The road is being strengthened as it will connect to the proposed Greenfield bridge on river Ganga from Shepur in Patna to Dighwara in Saran, being built as part of the Patna’s ring road project,” said Meena.It will be the sixth bridge on the river Ganga in Patna. The Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) has already allocated a sum of ₹3,000 crore to build the bridge under the Prime Minister’s special package to Bihar. It will be a key component of the larger ring road project for Patna and other cities in the north of river Ganga.A senior official of the RCD said the department has prepared to a detailed project report (DPR) to strengthen the road at the cost of ₹50 crore. The road is also important as it connects to a religiously important tourist place of Maner Sharif Dargah, once an ancient centre of Sufism in the eastern India. “Thousands of people from India and abroad visit the place every year,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/danapurmanerbihta-stretch-of-nh-30-set-for-new-makeover-101629479645386.html
20-08-2021||Other||Bengal BJP losing celebrity factor with actors quitting amid differences||The West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is running out of its celebrity faces with a host of actors, who joined the party prior to the March-April assembly polls, either lying low or quitting.Two actors from Bengali television and cinema, Rupa Bhattacharjee and Anindya Banerjee, declared this week that they have severed ties with the BJP. Several other popular actors have distanced themselves from the BJP, party leaders said.The development comes weeks after the Bengal BJP’s most prominent celebrity, Bollywood singer-turned politician Babul Supriyo, who won the Asansol Lok Sabha seat twice and served as union minister of state, announced his decision to quit active politics.Supriyo, who was dropped from the government during the cabinet reshuffle on July 7, said he would continue as an MP but would not attend any political event. He contested the Tollygunge assembly seat in Kolkata but was defeated by minister Aroop Biswas.Before the elections, in which the BJP secured only 77 of the state’s 294 assembly seats, more than a dozen television and cinema actors with no political background joined the saffron camp.Of them, Bhattacharjee and Banerjee took part in numerous debates and talk shows on popular news channels and batted for the BJP. Both were inducted in the presence of state president Dilip Ghosh but were not fielded in the polls. Bhattacharjee said she joined in 2019 with the hope that the BJP might usher in a change although she believed in Marxist ideology since childhood.The two actors faced criticism on August 16 for attending a programme that marked the completion of 500 days of a crowd-funded public canteen that Communist Party of India (Marxist) workers run at Jadavpur in south Kolkata.Reacting to this, Ghosh said, “Who is Rupa? Who is Anindya? I cannot remember them. I don’t remember inducting them. So many people joined us. Probably they came with the crowds. Celebrities do not struggle on the field. They only add to the party’s beauty.”Alleging that factionalism in the Bengal BJP is a dominant factor, Bhattacharjee wrote an open letter to Ghosh on her Facebook page on August 18 and said she faced this because she was inspired by Mukul Roy to join.Roy, who was a national vice-president, returned to the Trinamool Congress (TMC) on June 11.“I support each and every social welfare activity that helps. I don't see who is running it. I am not part of any party anymore. If you cannot respect artists, at least respect your party workers,” Bhattacharjee wrote in her letter to Ghosh. She also told the media that she does not believe in radical Hinduism.Anindya Banerjee did not criticize any leader but said he was not in the BJP anymore although he did not submit a formal resignation letter.A top Bengal BJP leader said several popular cinema actors such as Srabanti Chatterjee, Payel Sarkar, Tanushree Chakraborty and Yash Dasgupta, all of whom unsuccessfully contested the polls, have not been seen at any BJP programme in recent months.“Those who invited actors at random should explain why they are leaving us now,” said the leader who did not wish to be named.Fielding actors in the polls became a bone of contention in the BJP in May when senior leader and former Tripura governor Tathagata Roy accused Ghosh and national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya of selecting unfit candidates.In his tweets, Roy called some female actors “politically stupid.” This led to a row.The TMC also fielded some people who had no political experience. Of them, actor Saayoni Ghosh, who lost the contest from West Burdwan district, was later made president of the party’s youth wing.ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bengal-bjp-losing-celebrity-factor-with-actors-quitting-amid-differences-101629479586654.html

20-08-2021||Lucknow||Cong holding chaupals, lending ear to villagers’ problems||LUCKNOW Congress leaders and workers are going door to door and telling people – “We are here to listen to your problems” – as part of the three-day ‘Jai Bharat Jansampark’ mega campaign launched by the party in UP from August 19 to 21. As many senior leaders, including former union ministers, former MPs and sitting/former legislators are leading the campaign in many districts, the elders recognize them instantly. But others, who are new in the party, have to introduce themselves to people before starting the conversation. If senior Congress leaders are to be believed, the party leaders are getting a good response. “We are going door to door, covering all houses in villages and getting a good response. As we interact with the people and hold ‘chaupal’, people are now coming forward to vent their ire against the BJP. They have begun considering the Congress as an alternative to the BJP,” said Pradeep Mathur, former BJP MLA, who has been leading the campaign in Mathura. The UP Congress Committee (UPCC) has launched a number of agitations and campaigns in recent months, and according to UPCC spokesman Ashok Singh, criminal cases have been registered against more than 50,000 party leaders and workers for taking up the cause of people. Following directives from Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi, the UPCC has sent about 15,000-20,000 party leaders and workers to villages with a target to connect with 9 million people. Priyanka also asked them to honour freedom fighters, their families, farmers and others there. “About 20,000 leaders, office-bearers and workers have been sent to visit villages and wards. Party leaders will camp and connect with about 9 million people in about 35,000 villages,” said Ajay Kumar Lallu, UPCC president, from Gorakhpur. “We are holding ‘chaupals’ in villages, listening to problems of people and honouring families of freedom fighters, teachers, advocates and workers in villages,” added Lallu. Apart from Lallu, those leading the Congress’ mega campaign in villages and urban areas include Congress Legislature Party leader Aradhna Mishra ‘Mona’ (Pratapgarh), former UPCC president Nirmal Khatri (Ayodhya), Pradeep Jain ‘Aditya’ (Jhansi), former MP Rajesh Mishra and party leader Ajay Rai (Varanasi). “We got a good response in Lucknow, where party MLC Deepak Singh led the campaign,” said Onkar Nath Singh, UPCC spokesman. “People know elections are round the corner and the mega campaign is a poll stunt by the Congress. The party should have done all this earlier,” said Professor SK Dwivedi, former head of department, political science, Lucknow University.Besides launching agitations on various issues, the UPCC had recently launched “BJP Gaddi Chhodo” campaign from August Kranti Divas (August 9) and the party’s legislators had marched from GPO Park to Vidhan Bhawan in Lucknow to press their point about freedom of expression. UPCC president Ajay Kumar Lallu and CLP leader Aradhana Mishra ‘Mona’, who led the march, said the BJP government was registering criminal cases against those launching any agitation and raising their voice. “We wanted to convey to the state government that the party leaders are ready to get arrested for raising people’s voice,” said Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cong-holding-chaupals-lending-ear-to-villagers-problems-101629479105928.html

Sources in the chief minister’s office said the JMM leader underlined that the Opposition needs to “resist anti-people policies of the central government in a cohesive manner.” Speaking at the meeting, Soren said the Opposition needs to raise the pitch for declaring the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic as a national disaster.“We should join hands and push for the demand. The Centre needs to provide adequate compensation to families who lost their loved ones. People were forced to sell their property and jewellery for treatment and they are now facing uncertainties about their future.”The JMM leader underlined that there are enough national and international issues on which the Opposition could corner the BJP. He, however, advised to choose issues with which people connect. “We need to take up burning issues which connect with people. Common people like farmers and labourers hardly connect with issues like Pegasus. The Opposition needs to focus more on issues such as inflation, unemployment and farmers’ issues,” he said. Soren said that the Opposition should also take up issues such as the Parliament fiasco, alleged silencing of democracy and caging of the institutions.The JMM leader also pointed out that the issues of the states are not being addressed. “As part of a collective framework, the Opposition, including all non-NDA ruled states, should immediately take up these issues especially those being faced by non-BJP run states,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/soren-attends-opposition-meet-calls-for-cornering-bjp-on-people-s-issues-101629478505559.html

Unions have also claimed that their protest will continue indefinitely. The protest started from Dhanowali village of Jalandhar district and by the late afternoon, the unions had also blocked the rail track near Dhanowali between Jalandhar - Chaheru section. They blocked the movement of trains on the Ludhiana Amritsar and Ludhiana-Jammu tracks. The Ferozepur railway division said movement of 31 trains were hit, with six being cancelled and nine diverted. Bharatiya Kisan Union (Doaba) president Manjit Singh Rai and general secretary, Satnam Singh Sahni, said, “The Capt government did not increase even a single penny for sugarcane crop over the past four years. We will continue to block the national highway and the tracks till the time the state government agrees to meet our demands.” On the national highway that connects major cities of Punjab and Jammu, traffic was badly hit, with the police resorting to diversions. “We have conveyed to the CM Capt Amarinder Singh and the cane commissioner of the state to hold meeting with us at the earliest,” said a farm leader. Later in the day, Jalandhar deputy commissioner Ghanshyam Thori, police commissioner Gurpreet Singh Bhullar, and SSP Naveen Singla met farmers near Paragpur on the national highway itself. Then DC told the farmers that the state government had already increased the sugarcane crop SAP from ₹310 to ₹325; farmers, however, remained adamant on their demand for a higher increase. Farm leader Sahni said, “The Punjab government has forced farmers to block the national highway, which affects the common man. We are also helpless as the state government has left us with no other option.” PASSENGERS INCONVENIENCED IN LUDHIANAThousands of passengers travelling in trains which had to ply through the Ludhiana station faced harassment due to the protest. Officials added six trains were diverted from their usual routes and six were cancelled.

Each family can get treatment cost up to ₹5 lakh per year and women will get benefits up to ₹10 lakh per year under BSKY. This is the first of its kind scheme in the country. It will go a long way in strengthening the health security of people in the state,” Patnaik said while launching the distribution of the smart card.Around 9.6 million families in the state will receive these smart cards that would enable them to avail cashless health coverage across more than 200 empanelled private hospitals in and outside the state. The smartcards with a 64KB chip will have the details of family members and a 12-digit distinctive registration quantity. Each family will be given two cards in case two people fall sick at the same time.In the first phase, the cards will be distributed in Malkangiri, Balangir, Sundargarh, Mayurbhanj and Gajapati districts before covering the remaining 26 districts by November. The beneficiaries can avail healthcare facilities under the scheme from September 1. In Malkangiri, where the health indices are pretty dismal, 1,55,823 smart cards will be distributed between August 21 and 25.The BSKY smart card scheme is a new version of the Biju Swasthya Kalyan Scheme that was first launched in August 2018 to lessen the out of pocket (OOP) expenses which were very high as per the national health accounts estimate for 2016-17. The scheme allowed the convergence of erstwhile Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana, Biju Krushak Kalyan Yojana and Odisha State Treatment Fund without any premium contribution by the beneficiary or insurance intermediary. Under the old scheme, over 7.1 million farmer families, as well as people receiving foodgrains under Antoday Anna Yojana, were being given identity cards through which they could get treatment in empanelled private hospitals.State health secretary PK Mohapatra said by November all the 9.6 million families in the state would be covered. From September 1, those who have the smart card would have to produce it at private hospitals for treatment while those who don’t have it can show the NFSA or SFSA card for availing cashless care up to the annual financial limit.Political analysts said the move to issue BSKY smart cards ahead of next year’s local body polls is a welcome step as it signalled the moving away from politics of freebies.“Yesterday, Odisha government announced the creation of over 1,100 posts of nursing officials in various primary health centres, community health centres, the district headquarters hospitals and medical colleges. Today’s launch of the BSKY smart card shows the intent to move toward the politics of infrastructure which was prevalent during Vajpayee’s days when elections were fought over Bijlee, Sadak and Pani. A lot of improvements are needed in the healthcare system of the state and this is a step in the right direction,” said Gyanaranjan Swain, a political science professor.But opposition BJP said the scheme is a scam. “Nothing has changed. Even under the old BSKY, beneficiaries were not being treated at the empanelled private hospitals as those hospitals had over ₹50 crore outstanding. During the Covid wave, several people were refused treatment in private hospitals. The government never gives any information on how many people were treated under BSKY whenever RTI applications are filed. The government just loves to keep everyone in dark,” said BJP spokesperson Lekhashree Samantsinghar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-launches-special-smart-card-scheme-for-healthcare-101629475805208.html

The state government had organised a function adhering to Covid norms at the Longowal grain market, where school education minister Vijay Inder Singla and forests minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot paid tributes to the leader. Scores of farmers under the Kirti Kisan Union opposed the ministers. Bhupinder Singh Longowal, state leader of Kirti Kisan Union, said, “We showed black flags to Congress ministers at the grain market. We also opposed the gathering of leaders outside Gurdwara Kambowal Sahib, where the SAD had held a religious gathering. Our leaders are busy holding political functions, instead of strongly opposing black laws.”SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal skipped the event held at Gurdwara Kambowal Sahib where ex-Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) chief Gobind Singh Longowal and the acting jathedar of the Akal Takht Giani Harpreet Singh and other party leaders paid tributes to Longowal. The protesters forced former MP and senior SAD leader Prem Singh Chandumajra to return from the gate of the Kambowal gurdwara. Though Chandumajra tried to convince the protesters to let him enter, they started raising slogans and, allegedly, damaged his car. The former MP returned without attending the event.SAD (Samyukt) leader and Rajya Sabha member Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa paid his tributes to Longowal in a separate event at Gurdwara Bhai Mani Singh Ji.Later in the day, Singla, however, claimed that the farmers were not opposing their function but were protesting against the Centre’s farm laws, adding, “Longowal had taken the initiative of Rajiv-Longowal accord for the progress of Punjab. He made a significant contribution to the progress and peace of Punjab and Punjabiyat.” Gobind Singh Longowal condemned the opposition to Chandumajra, adding that the farmers had interrupted a religious event. Punjab being pushed into a civil-warlike situation: Akal Takht jathedarActing jathedar of the Akal Takht, Giani Harpreet Singh, said he suspected that using the three farm laws as an excuse, Punjab is being pushed towards a civil-war like situation and the Centre wanted to impose governor rule in the state.“I suspect that this is a big strategy of the Central government to push Punjab towards a civil-war like situation and prepare the ground for governor’s rule. Those who are protesting are farmers, and those who are being opposed are also farmers. They are not BJP-backed people. All are farmers and the sangat is also farmers.”“In Sikhism, politics is not above religion. Due to human desire, however, politics is dominating as people prefer this,” the jathedar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/longowal-death-anniversary-farmers-oppose-leaders-presence-sukhbir-skips-sad-s-religious-event-101629473105021.html

How much of a city’s character is defined by its restaurants? Would it be wrong to say that restaurants command the same import as a city’s important cultural elements like its museums, theatres and art galleries? After all, what would some of the world’s great cities be without their restaurants? Paris without its cafes, Rome without its trattorias, Tokyo without its Izakayas, Barcelona without its tapas bars or New York without its neighbourhood delis? *****************************************At their most basic level, of course it’s the convenience restaurants offer that made them such a mainstay of modern life — having someone prepare one’s meal, serve it and wash up after is no mean service, in an age when time and energy are at a premium. The nine-to-five lifestyle of white-collar workers and the fact that more women are working outside their homes, all make the convenience of eating out a very attractive proposition. But that’s just one part of their popularity. Restaurants also provide a level playing field for the more impersonal interactions which are the staple of modern living, such as business meetings, job interviews, first dates and office discussions, where people are required to meet over a meal, to discuss the subject at hand, with little distractions. For tourists, travellers and wanderers, restaurants are a way to experience first-hand a city’s culture; even without dining at a local home, a tourist can feel welcome and experience the rites and rituals of a new city, just by sitting among strangers and partaking of the food. Restaurants are also the go-to places for celebrations — how else to mark a birthday, anniversary or hot date than at one’s favourite restaurant, where for a brief period one is transported away from the everyday and mundane, and is made to feel special and cherished? *****************************************Of course, in today’s food-obsessed world where cuisine has come to represent much more than nutrition and sustenance, restaurants have come to be regarded almost as the temples of modern life, and their celebrated chefs as their high priests. Food and foodies have captured the public imagination in the past two decades as never before. TV shows based on food, food awards and contests and food-related content are an integral part of our lives today. What’s more, food has come to be seen as a community exercise; it’s not as important to have tasted a dish as to have shared it on social media. A popular cartoon in the New Yorker captured the zeitgeist perfectly — a couple goes out to a fancy restaurant and orders their food. As they are about to finish their first course, the server interrupts them and asks, “Pardon me, is everything all right?” The couple is surprised and replies in the affirmative. The server responds, “But, you haven’t even photographed your food yet!” More than the taste on your palate, food today has come to represent a person’s status, style and taste, much the same way as their choice of fashion or vocation does. Often, much of the restaurant-going experience is about being seen at the right place. Patronising a particular eatery sends out messages of who you are and what you aspire to. *****************************************Considering their ubiquity, it is almost difficult to imagine that restaurants across the world are facing an existential crisis today. Perhaps the worst-affected are restaurants in India. Though it employs and provides jobs to thousands, here, the restaurant sector appears to be the favourite punching bag for the powers that be. So, while governments around the world have stepped in to help their local restaurants through the lockdowns in the past year (even paying some of the wage bill in cities like London), Indian restaurant haven’t been afforded the same considerations. Among the first to down their shutters at the start of the Covid-19 lockdown last year, Indian restaurants seem to be the last to open their doors to customers. Last week, in a move that appeared hopeful, their working hours were relaxed till 10pm. However, the city’s leading restaurateurs have been crying foul about the regulation that requires all members of staff to be fully vaccinated, and say the government has unrealistic expectations and is giving them step- motherly treatment (given the shortage of vaccines). When train services, malls and cinemas have been opened, they ask why their particular requirements haven’t been considered. On its part, the government argues that it is for everyone’s safety and that restaurants by definition will have mask-less customers, and the probability of spread is heightened. *****************************************It is too early to say how things will eventually pan out, but given the way things are going, it would not be wrong to speculate if the city’s restaurant scene will ever be the same again. Many cherished establishments have already downed their shutters; the enterprising and agile among them have taken to other forms of business, such as food deliveries and innovative DIY offers. And though some restaurateurs have managed to put on a brave face, each will tell you in private that they are unable to meet their expenses and do not know how long they can survive, if things don’t improve soon. So, will families line up every Sunday outside the city’s chaat establishments for some pani-puri and bhel? Will the kitty party ladies return to their Chinese hang outs? Will locals take their tourist friends to the city’s Malvani and seafood specialty restaurants to eat crab, bombil or prawn koliwada? Will the paparazzi be back waiting for Tiger Shroff outside his favourite Bandra eatery? Will international Michelin starred chefs jet in to conduct celebrated pop ups with their Indian counterparts? Will hordes of teenagers converge at the coffee shops of their favourite five-stars for some after dinner coffee and hi-jinks? No one can say for sure, the proof of the pudding, after all, is in the eating…||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-mumbai-s-melting-pot-101629471725488.html

Even as Taliban leaders have approached them and assured safety, they are not reassured and still want to leave. Airport access, however, remains a major challenge for them, with armed men of the Taliban militia guarding roads leading to the facility, which remains under the control of US troops. “It takes 20-30 minutes to reach the airport from the gurdwara. This is worrying all the Sikhs and Hindus holed up inside,” a Khalsa Aid volunteer, who is in touch with the persons inside the gurdwara, told HT. The people inside the gurdwara have uploaded a video online where they are appealing to the Sikhs settled in the US and Canada to help them in evacuation. Responding to the situation, the Canadian government had announced, a few days ago, that it would permanently resettle 20,000 ‘vulnerable’ Afghans, including Sikhs and Hindus, who are fleeing amid the Taliban’s deadly takeover of the country. The Indian government has also introduced a new category of emergency electronic visas (e-visas) for Afghan nationals.

Of the six siblings born in a modest family, Shaheena is the only one with a college degree in arts, but she had to drop out due to the family’s economic condition in 2004. “I started learning shawl weaving from my elder brother, while our father, Ghulam Ahmad Rather, used to tin-coat (kalai) copper utensils,” she recalls. Four of her siblings, including two brothers, became shawl weavers but her penchant for innovation began getting her business and recognition. In 2014, she received the Jammu and Kashmir’s exemplary entrepreneur award for her Kani shawls. In 2017, she was felicitated by Hindustan Times at its sixth edition of 30 young achievers from the region. Opportunity in adversity All was well until her marriage in 2017 to an abusive husband, who forced her to quit weaving. After 15 difficult months, she got divorced but was not welcomed back by her brothers. She started from a scratch again, this time with some personal savings. “I wouldn’t have been here in the first place had my brothers not supported me. But then things change. After the divorce, I became a stranger in my own house,” she says. “I decided not to give up. I had started from zero and was back to zero. I took it as a challenge and with the help of neighbours have succeeded again,” she says. Shaheena started living with her mother in a part of their ancestral house and travelled to Amritsar in 2019 to participate in a handicraft exhibition. She took a loan to put her business back on track and today it’s flourishing despite the Covid-19 restrictions. Know your customer Weaving the Kani shawl is a traditional and intricate art, but artisans rarely get the returns for middlemen pocket the gains. After registering with the J&K handicrafts department in 2008, she went for an exhibition the next year that was the turning point. “Few educated women join the shawl sector. That exposure gave me the confidence and insight into the demand,” she says. “People abroad prefer tone to tone shawls instead of colourful ones. Once I even saw my shawl displayed in a showroom in Italy!” she says. Shaheena recalls how one of her uncles was on the brink of bankruptcy. “He had woven shawls on traditional patterns but there were no takers. He didn’t know the trend. Weavers hardly do, but with a little help, he started getting good returns,” she says. She credits her knowledge about customer preferences to her travels to handicraft exhibitions in different cities, including Delhi, Jaipur and Amritsar. “Now, there are several export offers, too,” she says. Help others to help yourself Shaheena is invited by the handicrafts department to give motivational speeches to women artisans. “I’ve given over 100 motivational speeches at awareness camps. More women are joining the handicrafts business. They realise that a woman is not insecure when she leaves home to do something in life,” she says. “Girls can take on any challenge. I work more than my brothers,” she says. At present, she provides employment to about 1,000 people, including Pashmina spinners, weavers, dye givers and washermen and women. Every year, she produces about 100 shawls, including plain Pashmina, Kani and Sozni. “I keep innovating. I’ve started a readymade garment business of pherans and stoles in addition to the shawls,” she adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/emblems-of-empowerment-innovation-with-tradition-weaving-a-success-story-101629470344833.html

The victim worked as a sand miner and was found dead with his two-wheeler at the spot.Initially, the police could find no eye-witnesses and had to rely on the sole clue - a short clip of CCTV footage that they chanced upon while trying to crack the case. In the footage, the deceased was seen giving a ride on his Activa motorbike to an unknown, unidentified person.“Several teams were formed to scour through the area for clues and also collect CCTV footage and carry out questioning of suspicious persons. After an intensive analysis of technical and human intelligence, a suspect was traced in Amravati, Maharashtra. Finally, on conclusion of a-48 hour-long interstate operation, the main accused, identified as Jaypuri Gosai, was apprehended in Ahmedabad, Gujarat,” Saksena said.Upon interrogation, Gosai revealed that he had come to Goa in June 2021. When he ran out of money, he decided to return to Ahmedabad and while on his way back, he tried hitchhiking his way and came across Bandekar near Patradevi. Upon seeing his gold chain, he was tempted to rob it, thus stabbed him and fled with his valuables.Gosai also told the police that he has no fixed profession and does odd jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/decision-to-offer-a-ride-proves-deadly-for-50-year-old-goan-man-101629468366102.html

The Centre had asked me to stop these farmers in Punjab and not allow them to come to Delhi, but I refused to do this,” he said, after launching a ₹520-crore debt relief scheme for 2.85 lakh farm labourers and landless farmers in the state. He dedicated the scheme to the state on the 77th birth anniversary of his friend, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.“Like every Indian, farmers also have the right to democratic protest in the national capital. These small farmers are not fighting for themselves, but for their coming generations,” he said, questioning the Centre on its failure to see the pain of protesting farmers. “We have amended the Constitution 127 times, so why are we not doing it now? Why is the Centre turning the farm laws into an issue involving its prestige,” he questioned, adding that he had categorically urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to repeal the laws.He added that the Centre need to protect the Minimum Support System (MSP) and the market system as well as the traditional relationship between the farmers and the arhtiyas in the country’s interest.Elaborating on the loan waiver scheme, the CM said his government was waiving loans amounting to ₹520 crore of farm labourers and landless farmers, with respect to the principal amount against their cooperative debt as on July 31, 2017, and simple interest levied of 7% per year on the above amount till March 6, 2019. Previously, his government had waived ₹4,700 crore worth of loans (up to ₹2 lakh of crop loan each) for 5.85 lakh small and marginal famers.On Friday, Amarinder handed over cheques to 21 farm labourers and landless labourers, with ministers and MLAs set to disburse cheques to others over the next few days.Responding to assembly speaker Rana KP Singh’s concern on the plight of small traders and urban shopkeepers amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the CM said the government will support them too. He ruled out any further lockdown, with the hope that the state would be spared the third wave of Covid. Addressing the gathering, MLA Raj Kumar Verka and MP Manish Tewari termed the debt waiver of farm labourers and landless farmers as a historic step towards the realisation of Rajiv’s vision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/i-am-with-protesting-farmers-centre-asked-me-to-stop-them-in-punjab-i-refused-capt-101629467884909.html
20-08-2021||Kolkata||CBI seeks case records on post-poll violence from Bengal police||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday sought details of all cases of alleged murder, attempts to murder, and rape reported during the post-poll violence in West Bengal this year from the state police, people familiar with the development said.The Calcutta high court on Thursday ordered separate probes by the CBI and a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the state police into the alleged violence. A five-judge bench headed by acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal said the CBI will probe the serious allegations of rape and murder and a three-member SIT those of arson and loot under the court’s supervision.Officials said the CBI has sought all the case records from the state police so that post-mortem reports, details of the sequence of events, statements of suspects, and witnesses, if recorded, can be examined.Four special CBI teams, comprising seven members each, have been formed to investigate the alleged violence. They will be assisted by local officers from the agency’s Kolkata office. Each special team is headed by joint directors – Anurag, Ramnish, Vineet Vinayak, and Sampat Meena. The teams will be under the overall supervision of additional director Ajay Bhatnagar.Virendra, the West Bengal police chief who is due to retire on August 31, could not be contacted.A state police officer, who did not wish to be named, said they will follow the orders of the Calcutta high court and cooperate with the CBI. “I cannot comment right now on whether the state government will move the Supreme Court challenging the high court order.” He added the state police can hand over papers only for those cases in which official complaints were registered. “We cannot do anything about the allegations made before the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).”Soon after the results of the elections were declared on May 2, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made allegations of widespread post-poll violence from across the state. The NHRC carried out an investigation and submitted its final report on July 13, recommending a CBI probe, and that trials should be held outside the state.In its report, the NHRC panel slammed the state government saying the violence “shows a pernicious politico-bureaucratic-criminal nexus”. It added at least 1,934 police complaints were lodged between May 2 and June 20. These included 29 murder charges, 12 complaints relating to rape and sexual assault, and 940 complaints of loot and arson. The report said that out of the 9,304 people named as accused, less than 3% are in jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/cbi-asks-bengal-police-to-share-files-in-alleged-post-poll-violence-cases-101629463865699.html
20-08-2021||Jaipur||BJP cannot tolerate criticism, considers it sedition: Gehlot||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government, saying it cannot tolerate criticism and considers it sedition. “In a democracy, criticism is welcomed but these people (BJP) cannot tolerate criticism...” he said while speaking at an event to mark the late former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s birth anniversary.He said Rajiv Gandhi believed that democracy should remain strong, and the country’s future should be bright. He added for this, he ensured the right to vote to people above 18. Gehlot referred to BJP leaders, who question what Congress has done over decades of its rule, and said the party kept democracy intact and the country undivided. He added there has been no military rule like Pakistan in India. “...governments in the country keep coming and going. The present government too was formed only because the roots of democracy were strong. These people forget this,” said Gehlot. He added it is very easy to say what has been done in 70 years.Gehlot said two prime ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi sacrificed their lives for the nation. “Our leaders made sacrifices and went to jails, and it was because of their sacrifices and struggle, the country got independence,” Gehlot said.Also Read | Rajasthan Congress MLA’s son alleges threats by father’s core teamBJP leader Mukesh Pareek responded to Gehlot’s comments saying the BJP believes in democracy and the Constitution of India, and the central government is working accordingly. “Unfortunately, it is the Congress which has failed in working as an effective Opposition.”Gehlot announced the state government will start the Rajiv Gandhi Innovation Awards for younger people with achievements in the field of start-ups. “ ₹2 crore will be given as a first prize, ₹1 crore as second prize, and ₹50 lakh as third prize.” Gehlot also announced the Rajiv Gandhi Scholarship for Academic Excellence for 200 meritorious students of the state to study at educational institutions in the country and abroad. He said about ₹100 crore will be spent every year on this scheme.Congress leader Sam Pitroda, who addressed the virtual event titled “Rajasthan Innovation Vision-IT for Good Governance”, said it is mainly because of Rajiv Gandhi that India is in a leadership position globally. “His idea was to improve the health system, education, justice, financial system through e-governance. It really improved productivity while using modern technology and tools.” Pitroda said there is still a long way to go. “I am concerned that institutions are being captured. Civil society has very little role to play and scientific temperament is not encouraged.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/bjp-cannot-tolerate-criticism-considers-it-sedition-gehlot-101629461824917.html
20-08-2021||Patna||ICAA to write to Bihar govt, CAG, V-Cs regarding financial mismanagement in varsities||The Indian Chartered Accountants Association (ICAA) will write to the Raj Bhavan, Bihar government, Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) as well as vice-chancellors of all state universities and other stakeholders regarding alleged financial mismanagement and ad hocism in the institutions in the light of a Patna high court direction.Patna high court, earlier this month, disposed of a petition seeking a probe into the non-maintenance of annual accounts as mandated under law by the state universities of Bihar with a direction to the petitioner to approach the authorities concerned within four weeks for redressal of his grievances. “The authorities shall consider and dispose of the petition expeditiously by a reasoned and speaking order preferably within a period of three months from the date of filing,” said the bench comprising chief justice Sanjay Karol and justice Sanjay Kumar on a petition from Sanjay Kumar Jha, president of ICAA.Also Read | Two Bihar cops suspended after video of them thrashing a man goes viralThe petitioner, a chartered accountant, had prayed for a probe by a high-level committee of experts into “mass irregularities, lack of proper information, mismanagement of allocated fund, UGC grant, misappropriation of grants meant for various schemes of the Centre, non-maintenance of annual accounts, as directed by the UGC, prescribed rules, regulations and laws.”The bench has given the petitioner the liberty to approach the court, if the need so arises, and request priority listing of the matter. “We have not expressed any opinion on merits and all issues are open,” it observed. Citing CAG reports, the petitioner, who made all V-Cs, the Centre and state governments as well as the University Grants Commission parties in the case, also underlined that compliance of Income Tax laws as well as other laws applicable to universities and colleges to ensure financial benefit had left a lot to be desired, causing a huge loss to the government. Several university teachers in Bihar were in a fix earlier this year after receiving notice from the income tax department regarding identification of high value information, which did not appear to be in line with their income tax return filed for assessment year 2020-21 (relating to financial year 2019-20). They were asked to revise their ITR and submit an online response on the compliance portal, while the teachers maintained the high value information was their provident fund deposit, which the universities in Bihar deposit in the savings bank account as an old practice, not in the general provident fund (GPF) account, to avail IT relief. “A loss of ₹12 crore was reported earlier in JP University (Chapra), which is shocking. There were no proper registers of the salary, pension, allowances and advance paid or to be paid by the college and universities maintained in electronic or other prescribed forms. The balance sheet (along with fixed asset register), income and expenditure account (pursuant to ICDS as notified by Central government) of universities and colleges as per accounting standards, guidance note, rules prescribed by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) were not found to be prepared,” the petitioner said. Jha said that the association had approached the authorities earlier also, but after lukewarm response it approached the court. “Now we will submit petitions to all of them again in the light of the court order. We have got four weeks’ time,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/icaa-to-write-to-bihar-govt-cag-v-cs-regarding-financial-mismanagement-in-varsities-101629461765126.html
20-08-2021||Delhi||L-G again rejected request for panel to probe O2 deaths: Delhi Dy CM Sisodia||Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Friday said Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal has once again rejected the Delhi government’s request for approval to set up an expert committee to investigate instances of deaths caused by shortage of oxygen in Delhi during the last wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in April and he accused the central government of “mismanagement”.“It is irrefutable that there was an oxygen crisis across several states, including Delhi, during the Covid-19 wave in April-May ...and it needs to be investigated... But the L-G has once again refused to give approval for setting up an expert committee to investigate death caused by oxygen shortage... While the Centre is collecting data from states on deaths because of oxygen shortage, they are not letting states investigate such deaths. It only shows that the Centre is trying to run away from the issue to hide its own mismanagement, which led to the oxygen crisis in the first place,” said Sisodia in a video press briefing on Friday.On August 16, Sisodia sent a file to Baijal’s office for the second time, seeking approval for setting up an expert committee to probe cases of Covid-19 deaths caused by oxygen shortage and sought Union home minister Amit Shah’s intervention.Also Read | Delhi reports no new Covid-19 related deaths on Friday, 11th time in second waveAt its peak, Delhi recorded around 28,300 cases in a day and the positivity rate exceeding 36% on April 20 and 22. Around that time, at least 31 people are believed to have died because of oxygen shortage in two separate hospitals – Jaipur Golden and Batra hospitals.On May 4, the Delhi government told the Delhi high court that an expert committee could not ascertain whether 21 deaths at Jaipur Golden Hospital had happened because of oxygen shortage. Later, health minister Satyendar Jain said it was a “preliminary report”.In June, the Delhi government proposed another expert committee to ascertain the number of deaths caused by oxygen shortage in the Capital during the last wave of the pandemic but Baijal did not give it approval, citing a similar committee set up by the Union government – eventually leading to a tussle between the elected government of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi and the L-G, who is an appointee of the Centre.On July 20, the Centre told the Parliament that states recorded no specific cases of deaths caused by oxygen shortage during the Covid-19 pandemic. With that, the AAP government in Delhi revived its demand for setting up its own expert committee on the matter.However, dismissing Sisodia’s claims as “misleading”, a senior official in the L-G office said: “The statements made by the Deputy CM are misleading. Neither the L-G nor the Government of India has said that deaths due to oxygen shortage should not be probed. What has been said earlier on 6.7.2021 and repeated on 19.8.2021 is that a high level committee constituted as per SC directions, where apart from senior and reputed doctors, the ACS (health), the government of national capital territory of Delhi is also a member, is already looking into the matter. It has submitted its interim report and is working on the final report. The L-G as well as the health minister, GoI, have reiterated that the said committee should be allowed to do its work. Setting up another committee for the same purpose will only create confusion. The government has also been advised to follow the directions of hon’ble courts in the matter.”This story will be updated when the BJP and the Centre react to Sisodia’s claims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lg-again-rejected-request-for-panel-to-probe-o2-deaths-delhi-dy-cm-sisodia-101629461524417.html
20-08-2021||Dehradun||Monsoon session: Cong to raise Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act, land law issues||The upcoming monsoon session in the Uttarakhand assembly in Dehradun is likely to be a stormy one with opposition Congress bracing up to attack the BJP led government by raising the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Act and land law issues.Congress MLAs, led by the new leader of opposition, Pritam Singh, would be moving private bills on the same during the session which will commence from August 23 to August 27. After the demise of the former leader of opposition, Indira Hridayesh, Congress would be with only 10 MLAs in the House having a strength of 70.Congress MLA from Ranikhet, Almora and deputy leader of Opposition, Karan Mahara talked about the party’s preparations for the assembly session which would be the last one before the state goes to poll early next. “Our MLAs are fully ready for the session armed with various important issues to attack the government which has done nothing for development in the last four and half years of its tenure so far,” he said.“We would be aggressively raising the issues of unemployment, women’s safety, health, education, farmers rights and others that are relevant to the state. Apart from these, we would also be attacking the government on the issues of Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Act and the demand for new land law in the state,” said Mahara.Emphasising the importance of the above-mentioned two issues, he said on the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Act, the priest community of the four highly revered shrines are already protesting for the last many months.“They have been demanding the government to repeal it. We too support them in their demand as it is totally against the age-old traditions of the four shrines and the rights of the priests. We have already said that, if voted to power, we would immediately abolish it. Secondly, the other issue regarding the demand for the new land law has also become an important one after previous CM Trivendra Singh Rawat allowed people from other states and industrialists to buy as much land as they can especially in the hilly areas. It is totally against the rights of the state’s residents. We will raise it with all might,” he said.The deputy leader of opposition added that the opposition would also move two private bills on the same.“Party’s Dharchula MLA Harish Dhami would be moving the private bill on Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Act while Kedarnath MLA Manoj Rawat will bring one on the land law issue in the House. Despite being low in number, we will try to attack the government with full force seeking answers on the important issues,” said Dhami.Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, meanwhile, while speaking to the media persons on the upcoming monsoon session in the House, said that the government will “welcome productive debate on the issues concerning public interests.”“We want a healthy debate on the issues related to the development of state and would seek cooperation from the opposition for the same. We will also answer the opposition on all the issues to be raised by it and later work on them in a positive manner,” said Dhami.Amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, carrying a negative RT-PCR report for all including the MLAs would be mandatory to enter the House. However, those fully jabbed would be exempt from it if they produce the vaccination certificate at least 15 days old............||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/monsoon-session-cong-to-raise-char-dham-devasthanam-management-act-land-law-issues-101629461404390.html

20-08-2021||Other||Global Village Idiot: What search engine algorithms get right, and wrong, about your queries||The other day I wanted to read what UK newspapers had to say about the India-England Test match. I asked Google, and then asked again, and guess what? The first couple of pages of search results gave me links to Indian media reports. I modified the search to include “UK media” and then I got a few relevant links.Every day I read three English-language national newspapers (physical copy). I also read a Marathi daily and scan a financial paper online. So one could say I get a reasonably well-rounded national and regional perspective on news. When there is a need for a global perspective, I search online for international media opinions - in this case, the UK media since it was a Test match with England. The sports channel coverage already offers me international cricketing perspectives - it is fantastic to listen to Sunil Gavaskar, Shaun Pollock, Michael Holding, Sanjay Manjrekar and Harsha Bhogle.But, I didn’t get the search results I wanted till I specifically searched for UK newspapers by name. I started wondering if Google has decided that I should read news only from the Indian media. Which would mean I have the dubious benefit of not having access to the world on my phone while living in an era where technology can provide me access to hundreds of global media links every second. I changed my default search engine to Yahoo and: the first page was full of links to Yahoo News and Yahoo Cricket News. No real media in the top search results! When I changed the query to include “UK media” it finally gave me some relevant links. Bing as a default engine delivered similar results to Yahoo.So I went back to Google and tried the exercise with other queries. Giant Panda. Lasagna. Biryani. Dubai Biryani. English Premier League. Giant Panda and Lasagna aside, it was a frustrating exercise. (Earlier this week, I searched for Afghanistan since the situation there rapidly evolved, and I got links to India-based media, although what I wanted was reports from Afghanistan).So when it comes to news, search engines seem to prioritise the location’s media and among them there seems to be some sort of further prioritisation. If I want to read info and stats and match reports on the English Premier League, I would expect search results to provide links to the English (as in England) media sites. I would not expect links to Indian media; just as I am not expecting links to European or American media opinions if I queried “Indian Hockey”. The source of my aggravation was expertise and plurality/diversity of viewpoints. Why was I suddenly getting local/regional results as a prioritisation? I queried “Google search results” and then started reading the documentation on search… it’s fascinating and pretty transparent. To quote a part of Google’s documentation: “To give you the most useful information, Search algorithms look at many factors, including the words of your query, relevance and usability of pages, expertise of sources, and your location and settings. The weight applied to each factor varies depending on the nature of your query — for example, the freshness of the content plays a bigger role in answering queries about current news topics than it does about dictionary definitions.”Expertise of sources is an important factor, but so is location, which seems to take precedence. Why am I investing so much time on reading documentation? Because something has changed in my online search experience and I am not getting access to more than one side of an event. I am reading match reports in local media, but I also want to enjoy Test match reports written by someone who understands Test cricket, knows the players and how to weigh the importance of every innings. Like Mike Atherton, a great cricketer and sports writer. Like Jonathan Liew, a well-decorated sports journalist who has this amazing knack to get into the game. (Liew’s pragmatically ironic buildup of Pujara’s 45 on Day 3 of the second Test was just brilliant). What I am saying is that I would like reports on UN events from UN sources and European news from European sources and Singapore technology news from Singapore technology sources and so on, in addition to the local view on those reports. If tech platforms are going to make it difficult for me to get a wider range of results beyond the location, especially for news and information that originates elsewhere, I am in danger of developing a unidimensional perspective to the world based on a diet of non-expert, non-source information.It also stands to reason then, that elsewhere in the world people from other nations are viewing India and Indian events and Indian news from a similar unidimensional diet of non-Indian sources of information. There is something very wrong with such locational prioritisation of news and information since it widens the abyss between peoples and nations. But that’s for another day. For now, I am going to enjoy the victory of the Indian cricket team over England in the second Test. What a hard fought and scintillating match!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/global-village-idiot-what-search-engine-algorithms-get-right-and-wrong-about-your-queries-101629456664229.html
20-08-2021||Mumbai||55% of beneficiaries in Thane city got at least 1st dose of Covid vaccine||In Thane city, 55.64% of the beneficiaries have got at least the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine, as per the municipal corporation’s records. From among the eligible population of 1.5 million, around 830,000 have been given the first dose and out of these, around 220,000 which constitutes 15% of the eligible population, are fully vaccinated. However, the drive hasn’t been conducted in the past two days due to a shortage of vaccine doses. There has also been a slight decline in the number of people coming forward for private vaccination. In July, 26,496 were vaccinated at private centres in the first seven days but in August, 23,963 took the jab in eleven days. The fake vaccination scam that occurred in a housing society in Kandivli and the unaffordable vaccine prices could be some of the reasons for more people opting for government vaccinations. Also Read | FIRs against BJP workers for violating Covid norms at Rane’s Mumbai rallyIn Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), 550,000 people were vaccinated in government centres while 280,000 in private centres. Dr Amol Gitte, Medical Director, Sidhivinayak Hospital, Thane, said, “We have an adequate supply of vaccines currently, however if compared to the previous months, the number of people getting vaccinated has come down. In June, there were around 3,000 vaccinations per day. In August, we are vaccinating around 300 per day.” The city has 85 private vaccination centres out of which 20-25 are operational. Meanwhile, the response improved in government centres this month; 25,188 were vaccinated in the first week of July but, between August 1 and 11, 33,551 were vaccinated. “With the new relaxation rules, the demand to get fully vaccinated has increased,” said Dr Khushboo Tawri, medical officer, TMC. In mid- June, a fake vaccination scam in a housing society in Kandivli also led to many housing societies refusing to conduct such drives anymore. “While most high rises have completed their vaccination drives, not many trust private vaccination facilities anymore. This must have also led to a shift in mindset,” said Kasber Augustine, President Thane Citizens Foundation. According to those working in private vaccination centres, the prices could be the reason for fewer people registering for private vaccination. “A family of four will have to shell out more than ₹3,000 which is expensive for many families...It is the unemployed or those staying in single building residences or from lower economic backgrounds who are yet to get vaccinated and they have no option but to prefer government centres,” said a doctor from a private vaccination centre on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/55-of-beneficiaries-in-thane-city-got-at-least-1st-dose-of-covid-vaccine-101629456484422.html

20-08-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh ends weekend curfew as Covid-19 cases fall||The Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday withdrew the weekend curfew on Sunday owing to a fall in the daily tally of coronavirus (Covid-19) cases in the state. The state reported 29 cases of coronavirus on Thursday, taking the number of active cases to 407. Two fatalities were also reported in the last 24 hours.Earlier this week, the state government had lifted the Saturday curfew and ordered shops and business establishments to remain closed only on Sundays from August 14. The government had issued orders in July asking shops and businesses to remain open from 6am to 10pm on weekdays and continue the weekend closure to keep the pandemic under control.The first set of weekend relaxations had been implemented after chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed officials to consider a partial easing of norms that were imposed earlier this year to contain the spread of the virus. Metro services between Noida and Greater Noida (known as Aqua line) have also resumed.Traders associations in the state had been seeking relaxation of weekend curfew since July, as shutting shops on Saturday and Sundays meant residents of satellite cities like Noida were getting done with their shopping from Delhi. “Markets collect the majority of revenue during weekends, and they will continue to suffer losses as long as the weekend curbs are in place. This not only harms the business, but the revenue also goes to Delhi instead of Uttar Pradesh,” Sushil Kumar Jain, president of Sector 18 Market Association and convener of Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) - Delhi-NCR, had told Hindustan Times.With an improvement in the pandemic scenario, the UP government has eased a number of restrictions in a graded manner, including the resumption of physical classes for high school students. Students of classes nine to 12 have started attending school in the state from August 16, while for grades six to eight, schools will reopen on August 23 and for classes one to five on September 1. However, attendance in schools is not compulsory for students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-ends-weekend-curfew-as-covid-19-cases-fall-101629452925270.html
20-08-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal apple rates fall amid glut, low demand||After a lean season last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Himachal Pradesh’s apple growers were hoping business would pick up this time, but their hopes have been dashed as rates in the wholesale fruit market have nosedived in the past fortnight due to a glut amid low demand. In two weeks, apple prices have gone down by ₹800 to ₹1,000 a box. The high grade Royal Delicious that was being sold at ₹3,000 a box of 20kg at the beginning of the season in July is now not fetching even ₹2,000 a box. Also read: Afghan women protest, say haven’t been allowed to work by TalibanThe average rate of the Royal variety of apples has also dropped to ₹1,200 to ₹1,500 a box, resulting in losses to growers. Apple growers say they spend ₹300 to ₹400 a box on plucking, grading, packing, washing and transporting the fruit to the wholesale market. One of the major contributors to the lack of demand for apples in markets is the low disposable income in the middle and lower middle classes. With most industries reporting a cut in jobs due to lack of demand, many people have ended up without jobs. Covid restrictions along with the recent floods and excessive rain are also to blame,” said Abhinav Jaggi, the owner of a private fruit supply chain. Commission agents delaying paymentsThe growers also blamed the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMC) and the government of inaction as commission agents manipulated prices. Sanjay Chauhan, a former Shimla mayor who is also an orchardist and secretary of the Kisan Sangharsh Samiti, said the expensive packaging material had dealt a blow to apple growers. “There is loot in the market. Payments are being delayed, loading and unloading charges are being fixed at whim and there is 2.5% bank charge. On top of that, roads are in a bad shape, hampering transportation. Farmers have to pay double for such stretches and some highways are worse than link roads. Last year, there was a landslide at Bhattakufar market, but APMC hasn’t removed the debris even after a year,” said Chauhan. Another orchardist from Thanedhar, Basant Lal, said apple growers were being charged ₹20 at Narkanda market but the APMC was yet to act. “Payments are delayed for months. The government must intervene. The commission agents have increased loading and unloading charges, while payments for sale are being delayed and the agents are now charging bank surcharge. But at the same time, they don’t pay any interest for delay in payments,” said Hardyal Sharma, an apple grower from Rohru. Hail hit crops in lower hills Pratap Singh from Madhavani said orchardists whose crop was hit by hailstorm were the worst hit as their apples are fetching low prices. “This year, the lower elevations had a bumper fruit, but due to the lack of size and colour development, they are not fetching a good price. Apple growing areas suffered one of the worst droughts in years. The rates are not up to our expectations. Apple growers from the middle and even higher reaches have started harvesting due to the drought and this has further caused a fall in the market rates,” Lokinder Singh Bisht, the president of the Progressive Growers Association (PGA). Shimla APMC secretary Om Prakash said if farmers submit a complaint in writing against commission agents flouting norms, action will be taken. He said the APMC has its people deployed in every market. The farmers can directly complaint to them, he added. Apple fact check Apples produced in Himachal Pradesh start arriving in the market in mid-July. Kinnaur apples are last to harvested in October. The ₹6,000-crore apple economy of Himachal Pradesh is the mainstay of 1.75 lakh families. Shimla district produces 70% of the total apples in the state, followed by Kullu and Kinnaur. Apple is produced over 1.25 lakh hectares in the state with a productivity as low as 3-4 tonnes per hectare. The state generally contributes 30-40% of the total apple produced in India, followed by Kashmir, which is at the top with 50% of the produce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-apple-rates-fall-amid-glut-low-demand-101629451984581.html
20-08-2021||Mumbai||Defect of mindset: Rane on Sena workers ‘purifying’ memorial after his visit||In Mumbai for Jan Ashirwad Yatra, Union minister Narayan Rane on Friday addressed the issue of Shiv Sena workers reportedly “purifying” Bal Thackeray memorial after his visit and police registering cases against his rally organisers a day ago. Speaking to the media, Rane said purification will not help if there was a defect in someone’s mindset. As a part of Jan Ashirwad Yatra, the outreach programme of newly inducted Union ministers, Rane visited the memorial which a few Shiv Sainik “purified” later by sprinkling cow urine. Bal Thackeray had expelled Rane for anti-party activities. “The party has its chief minister in Maharashtra, but they could not construct a memorial befitting of their founder. The people who have purified the memorial need to first purify their mind,” Rane said.Also Read | FIRs against BJP workers for violating Covid norms at Rane’s Mumbai rallyWhile speaking on the police action against BJP workers for violation of Covid-19 pandemic guidelines during the Jan Ashirwad Yatra, Rane said Shiv Sena should not forget that BJP rules at the Centre. “We have the entire records of the rallies and meetings organised in the state by the ruling parties. These are not the political rallies. We are going to the people to understand their problems and plights. They should first understand that we are sitting at the top (at Centre) and they are at the state level,” he said.Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said whoever indulged in “purification” did not understand the original Shiv Sena. “It is strange that the Shiv Sena is sharing power with the people who tried to imprison Balasaheb Thackeckeray and are attacking the people who have been paying respects to him. Purification bid is an indication of narrow mindedness of the party. It is not the culture of the Maharashtra,” he said. He was referring to then Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) government’s move to arrest the Shiv Sena founder in 2000 in connection with the 1992-93 Mumbai riots. The two parties are Sena’s allies in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government.Meanwhile, reacting to the episode, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said he does not recognise Rane. “It was done by the local party workers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/defect-of-mindset-rane-on-sena-workers-purifying-memorial-after-his-visit-101629448323850.html
20-08-2021||Delhi||Sadya meal: a feast to content the heart||A widely famous harvest festival of Kerala, Onam is incomplete without food. The revelries include a spectrum of cultural events, and the sumptuous Sadhya Thali is one of its highlights. “The popularity of the Sadhya meal in metro cities is rising, as food lovers celebrate Onam with choicest of dishes. The tempting aroma of the vegetarian delights lavishly spread on sparkling banana leaves garners an appetite for all,” says Vetri Murugan, head chef at Zambar, which is organising Zambar Onam Sadhya from August 20 to 22.The celebratory grand thali includes Uepperi (salted banana chips), Shakara Varratti (jaggery chips), Inji Curry (ginger curry), Mango Curry, Parippu with Ghee (yellow daal), Sambar, Olan (pumpkin curry), Pulissery (a dish of pumpkin and yoghurt), Ellisheri (a mix of pumpkin and lobia), Avial (mix veg), Chor (rice), Kaalan (raw banana curry), Moru Kachiyathu (buttermilk), Rasam, Pachadi (mix veg raita), Pappadam (crackers) and other food items. “Traditionally, 26 multi-course vegetarian dishes are served during lunchtime on the festive occasion. There used to be an era when 60 food items were served but gradually, the count has gone down,” says Gaurav Lavania, executive chef at WelcomHotel Sheraton, which is hosting The Grand Onam Feast, from August 20 to 22 at Dakshin.Rice, seasonal vegetables, coconut shavings, grated coconut, coconut milk and coconut oil are the basic ingredients used in the preparation of most of the dishes. “Kerala is a land of coconut trees and it is found in abundance in the state. Also due to the health benefits and ease of accessibility, it is widely used in cooking preparations,” says chef Reetu Uday Kugaji.“A banana leaf is placed in a particular manner and direction and the meal is served and consumed in a sequence,” says executive chef, Arun Sundararaj, Taj Mahal. The tip of the banana leaf must be towards the left side of the person consuming it. “It begins with salt, chips, papad, banana pickle, avial, and then small amounts of dal (boiled), ghee, rice and much more,” he adds. Onam Sadhya has several health benefits. “Banana leaves are packed with natural antioxidants, and when warm food is served on it, the antioxidants get absorbed into the food. Moreover, eating with hands benefits us in attaining emotional and physical well-being,” says Lavania.The food is eaten with the right hand, without any cutlery. “The dishes in the meal are served from left to right but they are eaten from right to left. The Sadhya can be concluded by drinking rasam or buttermilk,” says chef Kugaji. When one is done relishing the meal, one should fold the upper half of the banana leaf towards the lower half. “It denotes that the person who has consumed the meal is satisfied with the delectable food. And if it’s folded other way, it expresses the discontentment,” says Kugaji.

The viral clip shows the policemen roughing up a man after pinning him down on the road. The video triggered uproar on social media.According to a complaint lodged by one Gudia Devi before the Bhagalpur range DIG on August 2, the SHO of Bakharpur police station Bijendra Paswan, assistant sub-inspector Lal Babu Yadav and SAP (special auxiliary police) jawans assaulted 32-year-old Neeraj Yadav in front of his children.

20-08-2021||Lucknow||In UP, Opposition flays BJP for Jan Ashirwad Yatras by ministers||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) Jan Ashirwad Yatras, led by its newly appointed Union ministers, have begun generating political heat in Uttar Pradesh where assembly elections are due in about seven months.The yatras, covering 3,500 kilometres, touching over 120 assembly constituencies, have been criticised by the Samajwadi Party (SP), the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Congress, who claim that they showcase BJP’s misplaced priorities. The BJP has responded by releasing a “farq dikhta hai (the difference is evident)” poster series on the party’s twitter handle @BJP4UP, that show chief minister Yogi Adityanath as a doer and the Opposition leaders as “power hungry”. “Since elections are around the corner, these yatras help us get a sense of the mood on the ground. It is mandatory for all lawmakers to accompany the yatra in their areas. So, we are gaining insights into the public mind,” a BJP leader said. Meanwhile, the BJP has also launched a survey on the NaMo App. The survey “Bataiye aapki rai (tell us your view)” has queries such as which issues would be important in the assembly elections and lists several options. Yet another query seeks the people’s response on what issues would dominate their mind during voting. “We are seeking the people’s feedback ahead of 2022 UP polls. This feedback would also help us in finalising tickets and prepare our manifesto,” a BJP leader said. The yatras would touch upon virtually all the major religious centres in UP, cover Rae Bareli, the Lok Sabha constituency of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, and help showcase BJP’s bonding with allies as one of the seven yatras is being led by Union minister and Apna Dal (Sonelal) leader Anupriya Patel. At the start of her yatra, Patel flagged the demand for caste census and a separate OBC ministry, one which has found favour with several OBC MPs of BJP such as Lok Sabha member from Badaun, Sanghamitra Maurya, daughter of UP’s labour minister Swami Prasad Maurya. Of the seven new ministers of state from UP leading these yatras, three each are OBCs and Dalits, the two dominant political communities in the state while one is a Brahmin, the influential community which is being wooed by all political parties in the state.Meanwhile, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav has questioned the rationale of seeking “jan ashirwad” (blessings from the people) after causing them “hardship”. “Farmers, women, youths, Dalits, and other backward communities have been harassed. There were deaths due to scarcity of oxygen. There is rising unemployment and prices of gas cylinders and essential commodities are on the rise. Yet BJP is in celebration mode,” he said during a party protest recently.BSP chief Mayawati too was critical of the yatras. She tweeted: “When a large part of the state battled flood and many people needed to be rescued, the BJP decided to take out the yatras instead. It would have been better if instead of engaging in propaganda, the BJP concentrated on helping the flood-hit.”UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu said, “It is not jan ashirwad but a jan apman yatra (public insult procession).” “The BJP should instead take out a kshama yachana yatra (apology procession) to seek an apology from everyone,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/in-up-opposition-flays-bjp-for-jan-ashirwad-yatras-by-ministers-101629438062765.html

20-08-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab ex-DGP Sumedh Saini freed from VB custody at 2am||Former Punjab Police chief Sumedh Singh Saini walked free at 2am on Friday after waiting for 14 hours in the courtroom of the Mohali chief judicial magistrate following the Punjab and Haryana high court’s midnight order for his release from the Vigilance Bureau’s custody in a land fraud case. Following the high court’s directions, chief judicial magistrate Pamelpreet Grewal Kahal issued orders to release Saini at 12.15am, but Saini walked free two hours later once legal formalities were completed. Also read: Taliban wanted India to retain its diplomatic presence in AfghanistanThe former director general of police (DGP) was arrested by the Punjab Vigilance Bureau in a 2018 land fraud case on Wednesday when he had gone to the VB office to join investigation in a corruption case as directed by the high court. Saini’s release was ordered at midnight by the bench of justice Arun Kumar Tyagi after two rounds of hearing. The VB had taken Saini to the Mohali court around 12.30 pm on Thursday when information of an application being moved by his lawyers before the high court was received. The hearing was deferred till 4pm. But Saini was made to sit in the courtroom for nearly 14 hours till the high court order of his release was received. Abuse of the process of law: Lawyers “The high court has termed his arrest an abuse of the process of law. He was arrested in violation of three high court orders. The court had ordered that in the event of his arrest in the land fraud and corruption cases, seven days notice has to be given,” said his lawyer, HS Deol. The case was taken up by justice Tyagi at 11.30am and after 30 minutes of hearing, he summoned records pertaining to the arrest and first information report details by 3pm. The hearing continued in the evening for three hours. The state had roped in a battery of lawyers, including Supreme Court senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, who was assisted by five others. Senior advocate APS Deol appeared for Saini. In March, the court had sought details of FIRs in the cases in which Saini’s involvement is being probed and further ordered that if the former DGP was to be arrested in a criminal case pertaining to his service period, he be given an advance notice of seven days. Plea to advance hearing filed on day of arrest As the hearing began on Thursday morning, Punjab government lawyers sought time from the court to respond to the plea for pre-poning of hearing in the 2018 plea. However, the court did not agree. It noted that the preponement plea was filed on August 18 and the same evening Saini was arrested. “It is expected that parties will maintain status quo and will not disturb the same whether the case be on criminal side or civil side without approaching the court for appropriate directions,” the bench said, expressing its displeasure over the VB action. The observation comes in view of the fact that the case could not be taken up due to the Covid-19 pandemic and that there was a general order from the high court chief justice, extending the status quo during this period in all matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-ex-dgp-sumedh-saini-freed-from-vb-custody-at-2am-101629433202841.html

20-08-2021||Patna||Nitish to meet PM on Aug 23 to discuss caste-based census||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar will head an all-party delegation from the state to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 23 to discuss the demand for a caste-based census.“I had sought time from the PM to meet him with a delegation. The PM has given time of August 23. Many thanks to him “ Kumar tweeted on Thursday.The CM, who called on governor Phagu Chauhan in the afternoon, said the names of delegation members would soon be finalised and sent to the PM. “Tejashwi Prasad Yadav (of the opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal) will also go. He along with other members of the Opposition met me on this issue during the monsoon session. It is an issue on which all the parties are one. The BJP is also finalising the name (of its representative in the delegation),” he added.Yadav, leader of Opposition in the state, confirmed his presence at the meeting.The Bihar assembly has passed two resolutions seeking a caste-based census, something the Union government has sought to avoid, given the sensitivity of the matter.The demand for a caste-based census comes from a belief that the current reservation (or quota) regime is skewed and not representative of the current composition of the population.Earlier this week, Kumar praised the PM for removing the confusion on a state’s right to decide on other backward classes (OBCs) and said he was hopeful of getting him to discuss the matter related to caste-based census as well. His reference is to the 127th Constitution Amendment passed by Parliament in the monsoon session that concluded last week, and which restores the rights of states to identify and maintain a list of backward classes.“In Bihar, then CM Karpoori Thakur created a separate category for extremely backward classes (EBCs). Different states have done it differently, as they were empowered to do so. There was, however, some confusion for the last few years. After the court order, the Centre decided to clear it that states continue to have the right,” he said.He said that any decision on a caste-based census would be taken only after discussing the matter with PM. “Doing it at the state level will not be census. It will be counting only, as some states did in the past,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/nitish-to-meet-pm-on-aug-23-to-discuss-caste-based-census-101629414417122.html

Police said Shivinder’s wife, Aditi Singh, was allegedly duped of an undisclosed amount by people posing as officials who promised to bail him out.Police identified the three suspects as Komal Poddar, manager of RBL Bank in Connaught Place, and his two associates, Avinash Kumar and Jitender Narula, and said they were in cahoots with the mastermind, jailed inmate Sukesh Chandrashekar, who was earlier arrested in 2017 for duping a senior AIADMK politician.Rohini jail deputy superintendent Dharam Singh Meena and assistant superintendent Subhash Bhatra were also arrested.Additional commissioner of police (economic offences wing) RK Singh said the three bank officers had allegedly helped to facilitate dubious fund transfers. Police did not specify the money involved.Shivinder was arrested in October 2019 in a case pertaining to alleged misappropriation of funds at Religare Finvest Ltd.RK Singh said police had registered a case in June last year after Aditi complained that some people had posed as officials from ministry of law and offered to bail her husband out.“On August 7 and 8, we arrested two men who had come to take the money. The two then revealed that Chandrashekhar was running this racket from the prison. Chandrashekhar had spoofed the landline number of the ministry to make the victim believe that she was speaking to a senior ministry official. In this case, we had also arrested Meena and Bhatra,” the additional commissioner added.On April 11, HT had reported about transfer of five officers from Rohini jail, after they were found to have helped inmates, especially Sukesh Chandrashekhar, smuggle cell phones inside the prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/3-bank-officials-held-for-duping-former-religare-promoter-s-wife-101629407560917.html

20-08-2021||Chandigarh||Delay in machine repair: Fix responsibility, compensate for ₹100-cr loss, BBMB tells PSPCL||The Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) has urged the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to fix responsibility for the delay in overhauling of a 157MW power generation unit that caused a loss to the tune of ₹100 crore. In a communication to the PSPCL chairman-cum-managing director A Venu Prasad, BBMB’s financial adviser-cum-chief accounts officer Rajinder Kumar said a power-generating machine was handed over to private firm Gogoal Hydro Private Limited in October 2020, and as per the contract, the overhauling was to be completed by March 2021. “However, the machine of unit 7 has not been handed back to BBMB, leading to generation loss of ₹100 crore at a rate of ₹66 lakh per day. The happened during the peak load in the wake of paddy sowing season. The loss has to be borne by the PSPCL and other partner states,” Kumar wrote. Prasad, however, said he was not aware of any such communication. “I am writing to PSPCL because it’s a major partner of the BBMB and such lapses cause maximum loss to the state (Punjab),” reads the communication. The BBMB has brought on record that this is a case of gross mismanagement because BBMB chief engineer (generation) Rahul Modi and a deputy chief engineer (not named) from the PSPCL didn’t flag the issue. “The matter came to light only when a case was moved for additional cost of ₹37.75 lakh for the machine’s repair, which was over and above the contract value of ₹1.68 crore. “Truth is not being revealed,” Modi told HT, adding that the additional cost was proposed with a malafide intention to compensate the private firm for the ₹34-lakh penalty imposed on it. It is learnt that the BBMB management has been conveyed that the machine is beyond repair and a new will cost ₹25 crore. Kumar suggested that the losses should be recovered from the officers responsible and the private firm undertaking the work. The Bhakra dam has 10 power generation units. With another unit also under repair, only eight are functional at present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/delay-in-machine-repair-fix-responsibility-compensate-for-100-cr-loss-bbmb-tells-pspcl-101629403867604.html

It had submitted a 824-page report to the state government on April 21. The report also stated that if any person lodged a complaint against Dubey, the complainant was humiliated by the police.The inquiry commission report observed that though Dubey’s name appeared on the list of top-10 criminals in the police circle, he was not on the list of top-10 criminals of the district. Rather, members of his gang were included in a peace committee to resolve communal disputes, it noted, adding that the family members of Dubey were elected to local bodies. Most of the family members were granted arms licence, passport and fair price shop on the recommendations of the competent authorities, the report further stated.Investigation in any case lodged against the members of the gang was never impartial, the report said.Dubey and his associates got bail orders easily as there was no serious opposition by state authorities, it further said. There was total failure of the intelligence unit in Kanpur in gathering information about the possession of sophisticated weapons by Vikas Dubey, the commission report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/probe-panel-gives-clean-chit-to-police-in-killing-of-vikas-dubey-others-in-encounters-1629402545304.html

20-08-2021||Chandigarh||Rain damages portion of Ambala-Panipat highway||Incessant rains in the northern part of Haryana have left a substantial portion of National Highway-44 between Ambala and Panipat damaged. As per a statement issued by officials of the meteorology department at Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agriculture University in Hisar on July 29, Haryana has received 23% more rainfall this season. The rains have created multiple potholes while several small portions of roads have caved in after gradual soil erosion on both sides of highways, posing a threat to commuters. As a preventive measure, the National Highways Authority of India has created diversions by placing spring posts at such points, mostly on flyovers, said Bhanu Pratap, section engineer with NHAI in Ambala. However, commuters have complained of damage to their vehicles because of deep potholes and gaps in metal bars on the flyovers. Malak Singh, a weekly commuter between Karnal and Patiala, said due to the diversions, risk of accidents looms large when a driver is trying to overtake. “It’s been weeks that such pillars were put, but I haven’t seen any repair activity at these points. Rather, these lead to traffic jams. The authorities should complete the repair work at the earliest ,” he added. Meanwhile, Pratap said the number of potholes has decreased in the past few days as at least four construction vehicles have been pressed into service on the highway to plug the gaps. “Our teams are already repairing the section between Pipli and Ambala, while the rest of the area has been covered. Now, almost 80% work is complete on the entire stretch and diversions have been removed,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rain-damages-portion-of-ambala-panipat-highway-1629401282797.html

After hearing the arguments, the tribunal observed, “It has been proved that Jaspal Kaur had died in an accident due to rash and negligent driving of above said motorcycle by Balvinder Singh.”Thus the owner/driver and insurer of offending motorcycle are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation amount of ₹14.54 lakh, it said. Jaspal’s husband Amrik will be entitled to get 50% share out of the total amount of compensation while her two children will be entitled to remaining share in equal amounts, the tribunal said.

20-08-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali: Land acquisition for new link road begins||Moving ahead with land acquisition process for 6km long and 200ft wide link between the Airport Road and Kharar-Landran road, the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has issued a notification under Section 19 of the Land Acquisition Act for 73 acres. The acquisition process will be completed by the October end. Section 19 of the Act refers to the amount to be determined as compensation. The link road, which was proposed five years ago, will improve connectivity from the Airport Road to Kharar. With some major townships such as TDI, Ansal, and Gateway City adjoining it, the road will divide sectors 116 and 92 and sectors 117 and 74A to pass through Chappar Chiri Khurd, Chappar Chiri Kalan, Chajju Majra, Baliali and Ballomajra before connecting to the Kharar-Landran road near Swaraj factory. The road is a part of the Mohali master plan. A senior officer of GMADA said, “We have issued a notification under Section 19 of the Land Acquisition Act and will be completing the acquisition process by October end this year.” Umang Jindal, founder, Homeland Group, said the link road will be a better alternative to people travelling between Chandigarh and Kharar. “The stretch will also help the people residing nearby as at present, a link road is missing and commuters have to take a long route,” he added. GMADA chief engineer Devinder Singh said, “We will float the tenders for construction once the land acquisition process is over.” Extension of Airport Road 75% complete The 75% work of extension of the 200ft PR7 road, commonly known as the Airport Road, has been completed. The extension begins from the dividing road of sectors 120/125 (NH 5), Sunny Enclave and connects the PR4 road in New Chandigarh (Mullanpur). The work was allotted at a cost of ₹121 crore and will be completed by December this year. The road extension will reduce the distance between Mohali and New Chandigarh and is expected to save 15-20 minutes of travelling time between the two towns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-land-acquisition-for-new-link-road-begins-1629401277963.html
20-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s wait for upgraded waste plant to get longer||City’s garbage woes are unlikely to get over soon as the work to upgrade the lone solid waste processing plant in Sector 25 is not expected to start this year.With the code of conduct for Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) election set to be imposed mid-November and Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Ropar to submit the detailed project report (DPR) and request for proposal (RFP) for plant upgrade only in September, the tendering process is unlikely to be completed in the next six months. The allotment of tenders will be finalised only after the new MC General House is constituted, which is January 2022.MC commissioner KK Yadav said, “IIT Ropar will submit the DPR and RFP in September. This is likely to be tabled before the MC General House in September-end for its approval. The floating of tender and inviting firms for upgrade is likely to take another month.” The process will still be in works when the code of conduct for the MC election comes in force in November for the polls to be held in December.Notably, IIT Ropar has sought three months for the preparation of DPR and RFP. The MC General House had on July 29 decided to allot the contract for preparation of the twin documents to IIT Ropar.Earlier, the MC had sought quotations from Punjab Engineering College (PEC), Chandigarh, IIT Ropar, and Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, Patiala. Thapar university didn’t participate, but PEC and IIT submitted their quotations. The MC opted for IIT Ropar’s bid as it was lower than PEC’s.Setback for BJP?The city produces 550 to 600 metric tonnes (MT) of waste daily. Of this, around 200 MT is dry waste, 150 MT is wet (kitchen) waste, 75MT is mixed and 100 to 125 MT is horticulture. However, the plant’s current waste processing capacity is only 70 to 80 MT. In June last year, the civic body had taken over the plant from Jaypee Group due to its inability to process the waste completely. But since then, the MC has neither improved the plant’s working nor upgraded the technology and most of the daily waste is still being dumped at the Dadumajra landfill. The BJP was hoping to project the revamp of the plant as one of its major achievements in the last five years for the MC election due in December.Mayor Ravi Kant Sharma has repeatedly assured, both within the House and outside, that the work to upgrade the plant would start before the MC election.“The BJP-ruled MC took over the reins of the plant more than a year ago. But instead of improving it, almost no processing is taking place at the plant now,” said Devinder Singh Babla, Congress councillor and leader of opposition in the MC. “The garbage is being dumped without getting processed at the Dadumajra ground. The BJP had assured that work on the new plant would start this year. But now, it is unlikely to be the case. People are tired of BJP’s repeated failures to keep its promises. It will be a key election issue,” he added.Assuring that the work allotment would be done by October, the mayor said, “We have asked IIT Ropar to submit report by September 15. We will immediately call special MC House meeting and by October, would float the tender. By the end of October, the tenders will be alloted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhs-wait-for-upgraded-waste-plant-to-get-longer-1629400499244.html

He remained the CPS in the SAD-BJP government in 2007.Nannu said his supporters were upset over him being sidelined in the party and central government’s stand on farm laws.He squarely blamed the BJP leadership for undermining a strong undercurrent in rural and urban voters against the party.“The Punjab unit of the BJP failed to convey strong resentment against the party.

20-08-2021||Mumbai||Member of HC-appointed panel seeks to halt reclamation work near Mumbai’s Powai lake||A member of the high court-appointed wetlands grievance redressal committee has written to the authorities in Maharashtra and the Centre, seeking an immediate stoppage of construction works around the boundary of Mumbai’s Powai Lake – near Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) – for the purpose of building a cycling track. The work is being together carried out by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC). The work has now invited objections from environmentalists, who said that forest and wildlife clearances for the project have not been granted despite being mandatory. In their letter on Thursday, addressed to officials from the Union environment ministry, the central and state pollution control bodies and the state forest and wildlife departments, Stalin D, wetlands committee member and director of non-governmental organisation (NGO) Vanashakti, wrote, “The lake is home to the Indian marsh crocodile, a Schedule 1 protected species under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972... the National Board for wildlife and forest departments have not given any clearance... for this activity.”Stalin also pointed out that site of the ongoing work is “very much inside the lake waters”, specifically in the spillover zone adjoining the IIT-B jetty. He drew the officials’ attention to the past orders by the Supreme Court and the Bombay high court which explicitly prevent any construction work or reclamation within the boundaries of wetlands identified in the National Wetlands Atlas, of which Powai Lake is one. Construction work in the region, the letter points out, will impact the availability of water to the dense natural forests which line the periphery of the lake.“Instead of keeping the boundaries of the lake inviolate... the lake is being capitalised by using the area for construction,” the letter stated, warning that legal action will be initiated against the ongoing work if construction is not stopped, and the area not restored. Earlier this month, Omkar Mahadeo Supekar, a researcher with IIT-B, had written to the Union environment ministry, filing a complaint against the ongoing work, stating that it had resulted in the felling of trees and poses a threat to biodiversity of the lake. The Union environment ministry subsequently directed the complaint to the state forest department asking that the complaint be resolved. The latter is yet to submit a report on the same, as directed by the Union environment ministry.BMC officials were unavailable for comment. Officials from forest and wildlife departments said they will look into the matter and take necessary action accordingly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/member-of-hc-appointed-panel-seeks-to-halt-reclamation-work-near-mumbai-s-powai-lake-101629399368532.html

20-08-2021||Mumbai||Ex-Maharashtra home min: Will appear before ED after completing legal recourse||After skipping multiple summons issued by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the alleged money laundering case, former home minister Anil Deshmukh on Thursday issued a statement saying that the Supreme Court has accepted his petition against the ED action, which is expected to be heard very soon. The Apex court has also given him the liberty to appeal in the lower court and he will appear before ED after completing legal recourse. “The Supreme Court has accepted my petition against Enforcement Directorate action and is expected to hear the same very soon. The Apex court also allowed me to appeal in the lower court. Once the process of legal recourse is completed, I will appear before the Enforcement Directorate and extend full cooperation. In my entire political and social life, I have always followed high standards,” Deshmukh said in a statement released on Thursday. On Wednesday, the senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader skipped the summons issued by ED in connection with the allegations of corruption and extortion against him. It was the fifth summons issued by the central investigation agency. ED had issued fresh summons a day after the Apex court refused to grant any interim relief to Deshmukh. ED has registered a money laundering case against Deshmukh after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a first information report (FIR) against him on April 21. So far, Deshmukh has maintained that the allegations against him are false. The central agency has alleged that while serving as Maharashtra home minister, Deshmukh misused his position, and through assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze – who has now been dismissed and is in Taloja jail for his alleged role in the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran murder case – collected ₹4.7 crore from Mumbai’s bars for their “smooth functioning”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/exmaharashtra-home-min-will-appear-before-ed-after-completing-legal-recourse-101629398999682.html

20-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: FCI manager held for taking ₹2 lakh bribe||The Central Bureau of Investigation has arrested a manager of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and a businessman for exchanging ₹2 lakh bribe to extend favours in foodgrain procurement. The manager, identified as Gagan Negi, was working at the FCI’s regional office for Punjab in Chandigarh. The businessman, Ravinder Singh, alias Bunty, is from Amritsar. He owns a private firm, Bunty Enterprises, which deals in sale and purchase of rice. The two were caught red-handed during a raid at the Industrial Area, Chandigarh, following a tip-off. They were produced in the CBI special court on Thursday and sent to judicial custody. The FCI is a statutory body under the Union ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution, and among other functions oversees sale of surplus foodgrains in Punjab through e-auctions. According to sources in the CBI, Bunty was obtaining undue business from the FCI by manipulating the process of procurement and e-auction of foodgrains. He was operating several bidder IDs generated in the name of his firms to place multiple bids in e-auctions, and was paying Negi to look the other way. According to the FIR, Negi had favoured Bunty in getting an FCI tender at Makhu in Ferozepur, delaying special procurement at Patti in Tarn Taran, and delaying the inspection of his firm in Amritsar to give him time to reconcile his accounts. In the past few weeks, Negi had allegedly made several calls to Bunty to seek the bribe, and finally they had decided to meet near a mall in the Industrial Area in Chandigarh three days ago, where they were arrested. The CBI also conducted searches at various properties of the duo in Chandigarh, Zirakpur and Amritsar. According to the investigating agency, this is not the first time that Negi had received bribe from Bunty and is habitual of obtaining illegal gratification from many other mill owners in lieu of rendering undue favours. A case has been registered under Section 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 7 (public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of an official act) and 12 (punishment for abetment of offences defined in Section 7) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. If found guilty, they face imprisonment for a term not less than six months and extendable up to five years and will also be liable to pay fine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-fci-manager-held-for-taking-2-lakh-bribe-101629398759077.html
20-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray seeks to play role on national stage||With Shiv Sena chief and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray keen on playing an important role on the national stage ahead of the 2024 general elections, the party is trying to get a foothold in national politics. On Friday, Thackeray will participate in a virtual meeting convened by Congress president Sonia Gandhi with all chief ministers from the Opposition and key leaders to discuss on how to go ahead for the next general elections, Raut said. Besides Thackeray, other CMs of non-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ruled states, including West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin, Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel, Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot, Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren, among others, are expected to participate. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar also may participate in the meeting. Over the past few weeks, the Shiv Sena has been an active part of the Opposition’s camp and vocal in targeting the Centre. This is a deviation from the party’s policy as the party founder late Bal Thackeray chose to concentrate on Maharashtra and not get too involved at national-level politics. With the change of guard in the Sena, the party did not get the scope to spread its wings in the alliance with the BJP, although it has been putting up candidates in the Assembly polls outside Maharashtra, but without any success. The BJP stifled the regional party’s growth in the alliance. Now, Thackeray is looking to expand its base for the future. Political experts and observers pointed out the Sena is in a better position to get a good bargain on the national stage than it could have got with the BJP, as the Congress is weaker and is looking to stitch together an alliance to defeat the BJP in 2024. However, the party’s approach is a mixed one. It intends to play a bigger role in shaping national politics by becoming more active in the Congress-backed Opposition front, at the same time, continue to expand its base in electoral terms by fielding candidates in the Assembly elections in other states. The party plans to field candidates in Uttar Pradesh elections slated for February-March 2022. In states where it can dent the chances of BJP candidates, it is expected to put up its candidates. They may decide not to field candidates in some states where it could damage the regional party, like they did in West Bengal state polls earlier this year. Raut, who was the co-architect of the Sena-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), is trying to make space for Thackeray in the opposition camp at the national level. In the last one month, Raut has been taking on the BJP over the Pegasus snooping issue and had been a part of key Opposition party meetings chaired by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. Incidentally, poll strategist Prashant Kishor, who is now working with the Congress to build an opposition coalition, was an advisor for the Sena ahead of the 2019 Assembly elections. “The country definitely needs a strong leader like Uddhav ji, but that doesn’t mean that he will go and sit in New Delhi now. Now leaders like us are there [in Delhi]. But if we speak of the future, then Uddhav Thackeray ji will have to play an important role in national politics,” Raut said. The Rajya Sabha MP added that the Sena has always played a role in national politics and that the party’s opinions have always carried weight in New Delhi. “We have had ministers in the Centre, a Lok Sabha Speaker and governments have been formed with our support. As our numbers grew in Parliament, we have always played a role in Delhi. Besides, the Shiv Sena has taken a stand on several national issues, which the country has also agreed. Today, we are not a part of NDA or UPA, but we are there on the national stage. Our opinions have always carried weight, whether it is through Saamana or when Uddhav ji speaks.” Political analyst Hemant Desai said, “The party is projecting Thackeray as an able and strong leader. Popularity surveys have showed Thackeray among top five leaders and Raut has said that next year, he will be number one. Under Bal Thackeray, the party did not play a big role. The Congress and BJP were national parties then, but now only the BJP is that powerful. So they have a better chance to get a bigger role on the national stage.” Surendra Jondhale, political analyst and former professor of political science at Mumbai university, said, “It is also a political compulsion for the Shiv Sena, as it has to grow stronger in Maharashtra and outside. What we are seeing now with Raut meeting Congress leaders are political parlays, which will lead to something as we get closer to 2024. The Sena is a regional party and all such parties have national ambition. The Sena is looking at following in the footsteps of Mamata Banerjee and Sharad Pawar.” Meanwhile, the increasing camaraderie between the Shiv Sena and Congress will make Thackeray more secure in the CM’s seat. Since the MVA was formed, it was rumoured that Rahul Gandhi was against the alliance with the Sena, a former BJP ally. Earlier this month, Raut held a one-on-one meeting with Rahul Gandhi, cementing the relations between the two allies. Significantly, Raut remarked that the Congress and Shiv Sena are working “hand-in-hand, but now that hand has come on the shoulders”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-seeks-to-play-role-on-national-stage-101629398580372.html
20-08-2021||Other||10 priests of KV temple removed for charging extra money from devotees||Ten shastris (priests) of Kashi Vishwanth (KV)Temple were removed from the duty of conducting prayers at the temple late on Wednesday. The action was taken following the complaints against the shastris for seeking extra money (other than the prescribed fee) from the devotees, officials said. Divisional commissioner Deepak Agarwal cancelled the passes of 10 shastris which means that they won’t be able to conduct religious ceremonies anymore at the temple. Explanation has also been sought from two shastris and assistant public relations officer of the KV temple. Divisional commissioner took action during the meeting of officials of the temple administration on Wednesday evening when he was informed that the temple administration received complaint that the shastris who are also known as “nishulk shastris” (priests who get rituals performed without charging any fee) demanded money from the devotees. There were also complaints of misbehavior against them. As per the system, the devotees wanting to get a religious ritual performed have to pay a prescribed fee after which the priests perform the ritual free of cost. “There is no place in the temple for any such employee, who tarnishes the image of the temple and does not work according to the dignity of the temple. Therefore, action has been taken against them. We will take action if complaints are received in future too,” Agarwal said. Sunil Kumar Verma, chief executive officer of the temple congratulated the temple staff for doing good work during the month of Shravan that Hindus consider as pious.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/10-priests-of-kv-temple-removed-for-charging-extra-money-from-devotees-101629398519864.html
20-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh man told to remove 12 dogs from his house||Taking up a complaint of “nuisance and inconvenience” owing to 12 dogs kept in a house in Chandigarh’s upscale Sector 8, the area subdivisional magistrate (SDM) has ordered the owner to immediately remove the canines.The house owner in question is Rajbir Rai, a businessman. He has kept three German Shepherds and a Lhasa Apso as pets and is also giving shelter to stray dogs. He was earlier staying in Sector 15 and moved to Sector 8 about two years back. The order came after 10 people living on the same lane approached SDM (central) Tejdeep Saini, complaining that the canines fight all day and keep barking at night, disturbing the peace in the area.In the show-cause notice issued on August 11, Rai has been told to “remove the dogs from the area and shift them to some other convenient place”. He has also been asked as to why the order should not be enforced and cost be taken from him. In the case of non-compliance, he has been directed to appear before the SDM on September 1. Even Chandigarh Registration of Pet Dogs Bylaws allow residents to keep a maximum of four canines, at least two of whom should be adopted street dogs. Any violation can lead to penalty, and even criminal proceedings if dogs bite anyone. What neighbours say “For the past two years, we have been facing inconvenience due to these dogs, who keep fighting with each other and howling through the night, making it difficult for us to sleep. We have been requesting Rai to do something about it, and despite all assurances, he has failed to shift the dogs,” said Surjit Singh Kohli, one of the neighbours who made the complaint. Area councillor Maheshinder Singh Sidhu said the residents had been complaining for long about Rai keeping dogs beyond the permissible number. “There are a number of senior citizens staying in the area, who have been objecting to it,” he said.RS Gill, president of the residents’ welfare association, Sector 8, said: “A crying dog is considered a bad omen, and we are staying in a locality where it happens every night. We had earlier lodged a complaint with the municipal corporation, and after the officials visited Rai’s house, he had promised to shift the dogs. We had even lodged a complaint with police, but no action was taken.” Frivolous complaint: Rai Rai on his part termed the complaint frivolous, denying that he has kept 12 dogs at his house. He admitted to having four pets besides three stray dogs that he had rescued from a construction site in the neighbourhood. “Periodically, dogs walk into my house, and I feed them,” he said, claiming that he has been working for animal welfare. Rai alleged the present complaint was the result of a complaint of animal cruelty pending against one of the neighbours. “It is only to bully me. I will take it to its logical end and will not get bullied,” he said, while adding that he is awaiting a copy of the complaint and no one visited his house before issuing the notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-man-told-to-remove-12-dogs-from-his-house-101629398338117.html

20-08-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC grants relief to Sanjay Bhansali, Alia Bhatt||The Bombay high court recently granted an interim stay on the criminal defamation proceedings against producers of the film Gangubai Kathiawadi and actor Alia Bhatt. The film is based on a book on the women who were part of the Mumbai mafia and the underworld. In another petition filed by the alleged adopted son of Kathiawadi, HC refused to grant a stay on the release of the film. The son had sought the stay claiming that it would defame his late mother’s reputation. However, HC’s decision was taken after it was informed that there was nothing on record to prove the claim that he is the adopted son. The single judge bench of justice Revati Mohite-Dere, while hearing the criminal application by Bhansali Productions Pvt Ltd, Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Bhatt, was informed that the application challenged the summons issued to them on March 15 by the Mazgaon magistrate court in a defamation complaint filed by Babuji Rawji Shah against them. Senior advocate Aabad Ponda for Bhansali Productions, was making submissions submitted that the film Gangubai was based on a book authored by Jane Borges and Hussain Zaidi, which was published in 2011. He added that the film was based on a part of the book and they were not aware of Shah’s existence. Ponda also informed the bench that a civil court had dismissed a suit filed by Shah, wherein he had sought a permanent injunction against the authors of the book from publishing, selling or creating any third party rights in relation to the book. Ponda added that as Shah had failed to furnish details of the same to the magistrate in his criminal complaint, the summons issued to his client should be set aside. After hearing the submissions, the bench issued a notice to Shah and stayed the proceedings before the trial court till the next hearing of the application on September 7.Meanwhile on July 30, the single judge bench of justice Nitin Sambre, while hearing an appeal filed by Shah – wherein he challenged the dismissal of his suit – had refused to restrain the authors from publishing, selling or creating third-party rights on their book.Advocate Narendra Dubey for Shah had also sought an interim order from HC, seeking temporary injunction of restraining the makers of the movie from releasing the film.However, advocate Mayur Khandeparkar for the producers had submitted that the civil court had rightly held that a suit at the behest of the legal heir of the person alleged to be defamed was not maintainable. He added that as Shah was not able to demonstrate or get a declaration to prove that he was the adoptive son of Kathiawadi, he did not have legal rights and therefore, the prayer for injunction was liable to be rejected.While disposing of the appeal, justice Sambre held, “In a case of claim for defamation, action can be brought by a person in court of law provided he claimed to be defamed. Merely because the appellant is claiming to be son of such person cannot be prima facie inferred to have the legal right to show indulgence. Temporary injunction as prayed cannot be granted and as such prayers stand rejected.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-grants-relief-to-sanjay-bhansali-alia-bhatt-101629398044365.html
20-08-2021||Mumbai||Court allows PNB to sell Nirav Modi’s properties worth ₹440 crore||Punjab National Bank (PNB), which faced the brunt because of the alleged fraud committed by Nirav Modi, will be able to recover at least part of its dues, as the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court has ordered to release part of the properties belonging to the fugitive Diamond trader worth ₹440 crore, which were mortgaged by Modi’s firms with the nationalised bank.The special PMLA court last week allowed two applications filed by PNB seeking to release properties mortgaged by the bank against the credit facilities extended to Modi’s two firms —Firestar Diamond International Private Ltd (FDIPL) and Firestar International Ltd (FIL).As per the detailed order released on Thursday, the bank had sought release of properties of FIL worth ₹108.3 crore and properties of FDIPL worth ₹331.6 crore. While releasing these properties, the court said, “The claimant’s (bank’s) quantifiable loss has been recognised by Debts Recovery Tribunals (DRT) who has passed judgments in their favour.”As per the orders released on Thursday, the total outstanding debt payable by FIL to PNB consortium is in excess of ₹1,264.62 with costs and interest at 16.45% per annum from July 24, 2018. The total outstanding debt payable by FDIPL to United Bank of India (UBI) consortium is in excess of ₹232.15 with costs and interest from July 27, 2018.During the probe, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had attached several properties owned by Modi though his family members and also through these companies. The court noted that several of these properties have been ordered to confiscate after Modi was declared a fugitive economic offender.During the proceedings for confiscation of Modi’s assets, several properties were exempted from confiscation after the interested parties had raised objections. The banks and its consortium, too, had objected to confiscation of properties mortgaged with them against which Modi and his firms availed several credit facilities in the form of Letter of Understandings (LOUs).The bank hence approached the court earlier this year for release of these mortgaged properties, a majority of which are shares and debentures that were not exempted from confiscation but were attached by ED.ED, which was party to the hearing, had contended that it would take an undertaking from the applicants to return the said amount with interest in case the court at any point in time deems it fit.“No prejudice shall be caused in restoring the assets to the applicant, as upon confiscation of these assets on conclusion of the trial, the same are anyway liable to be restored to the applicants,” ED had contended.After considering all the aspects, the court has allowed the pleas of PNB and has directed the bank to give undertaking saying it would return the properties or its equivalent value when directed by the court. Further, ED is directed to make a list of the properties which would be released to the bank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/court-allows-pnb-to-sell-nirav-modi-s-properties-worth-440-crore-101629398040111.html
20-08-2021||Mumbai||Praja report: Performance of 90% Mumbai’s corporators poor; Congress fares best||Ahead of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls early next year, a report by non-government organisation (NGO) Praja has revealed that around 90% of city corporators have performed poorly, as per the parameters set by it. The current set of corporators were elected in the year 2017. According to Praja’s report, only two corporators have scored A grade, while around 90% (198) have received C, D, E and F grades in the overall performance from 2017 to 2021. The report by Praja stated that their report goes on to show that there is a need for major improvement in the performance of corporators. Owing to the pandemic, the NGO, instead of publishing the annual results, took into consideration the overall performance of the ongoing tenure. The NGO assessed the performance of the elected representatives on indicators such as attendance in the civic house and committee meetings, questions raised and funds spent on public amenities in the electoral wards. According to the report, the overall average score of corporators in the current term is 55.10% whereas, in the last term (April 2012-March 2016), the average score was 58.92%. In the April 2017-March 2021 period, of 220 councillors, 71 councillors got E and F grades, while only two have been graded A. Twenty corporators have received B grade, while a majority (127) councillors have received C and D grades.In terms of party-wise performance, the Congress with 28 corporators is the top performer, having scored 57%, followed by Shiv Sena (55.88%) that has 92 corporators. The Samajwadi Party (SP) with six corporators ranks third at 55.05%, while BJP with 81 corporators ranks fourth by scoring 55.01%. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) that has eight corporators ranks fifth by scoring 51.78%.Shiv Sena corporator and group leader in BMC Vishakha Raut said, “No party has worked hard like how the Shiv Sena has worked and touched the lives of citizens during this difficult phase of Covid-19. In the upcoming BMC elections, voters will give their verdict by placing their trust in us again, and that’s what matters for us.”Vinod Mishra, BJP’s party leader in BMC, said, “There’s so much corruption in BMC and in all this, if the Congress is the best performer, then I don’t have to say anything. Also, we believe that in the upcoming elections, public will give us a certificate in the form of votes and we will be able to have the majority.” SP corporator and group leader in BMC Rais Shaikh said, “We have been working really hard for our voters. Somehow, I feel the parameters by which NGO Praja analyses our performance should be relooked. I feel there should be a third-party assessment of our performance.”The attendance of corporators in committee meetings also has dropped from 82.15% in April 2017-2018 to 73.70% in 2019-20. The report further revealed that only 18% of corporators contributed to 45% of the total 8,609 number of questions asked between 2017 and 2021.Congress corporator and opposition party leader in BMC Ravi Raja was ranked as the best-performing corporator, followed by Shiv Sena’s Samadhan Sarvankar and BJP’s Harish Chheda. “The hard work done by the Congress and myself has been highlighted again in the findings of NGO Praja. Though we are small in number, we are very effective, and this is one reason for our success. Hard work and persistence never go unnoticed,” said Raja. Speaking on his ranking, Sarvankar said, “There is nothing different that I do but actual ground work by being available to citizens. The voters in my area are also quite active and my party has been very supportive. Also, having the Yuva Sena background helps.Chheda said, “In the previous reports also, Praja has given me several ranks and I am grateful for it. However, the real test for me is the votes, and I’m sure that the way I have worked for my voters and the fact that I have remained easily accessible for them, they will elect me again in the upcoming election.”Meanwhile, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) corporator from Bharatnagar area in Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) Gulnaz Qureshi, stood at the last position. In the top 10 corporators’ list, the highest (four) corporators are from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), followed by three corporators each from the Shiv Sena and the Congress. The report has stated that technology used during the pandemic has resulted in the number of increased meetings. In this context, the report stated: “Technology was used to facilitate ward committee meetings during this pandemic. We saw that four more meetings per month were being held during this time as compared to the monthly average of the previous year. From April 2019 - March 2020, the monthly average was 22 ward meetings whereas, when technology was used from October 2020- March 2021, the monthly average went up to 26 meetings.”The report has also stated that there is no improvement in the quality of questions over the years. Milind Mhaske, director, Praja Foundation, said, “As citizens’ representatives, it is expected that corporators would raise questions to the municipal corporation on the complaints made by the citizens. For the efficient running of the committees and to be able to address citizens’ issues in a systematic and efficient manner, we need more councillors in transition to A, B, C and D grades, while completely eliminating E and F grades of performances.”Nitai Mehta, founder and managing trustee, Praja Foundation, said, “Now that BMC elections are around the corner, we need to understand how our current elected representatives have performed in the last term and this can act as an opportune moment to introspect on the performances.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/praja-report-performance-of-90-mumbai-s-corporators-poor-congress-fares-best-101629397802849.html

This will be in addition to the Uttar Pradesh government’s order last week to reserve Saturdays, called “second dose day”, for only second dose beneficiaries.According to Co-Win, the district till Thursday had administered over 1.7 million doses of which only 19% (or 342,575) were second doses. The health department’s data till August 15 showed that nearly 26% of those in the 45+ age group population (estimated at 878,250) in Ghaziabad got their second dose, while this was 43% of the population in the 18-45 age group (1.8 million).“We have allowed walk-in facility, in addition to the online booking facility, for second dose beneficiaries with a preference for senior citizens, persons with disabilities, women and pregnant women.The walk-in facility was already available to those of 45 years,” said Dr Neeraj Agarwal, additional CMO and nodal officer for Covid vaccination.The district is already making calls from the Integrated Covid Command and Control Centre (ICCCC) and the chief medical officer’s (CMO) office to beneficiaries whose second dose is due.“People often forget the due date for their second dose, and many also wonder whether they have to register again. So, we have a dedicated team at our office that calls 1,000 people every day to inform them,” Dr Agarwal added.The state of UP has so far administered 62 million doses, which includes 9.7 million second doses- a coverage of about 15.61%.On the first day “second dose day” on August 14, Ghaziabad could administer only 7,534 doses. Officials attributed the low figure to low supply of vaccine. The same day, Uttar Pradesh had administered 338,801 doses, which included 243,320 second doses.“Getting a second dose is must and beneficiaries must get the second dose in order to get maximum protection against the Covid. There should be more awareness campaigns and special drives should also be conducted to increase second dose coverage. But for this, vaccine availability should also be ensured,” said Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-takes-step-to-increase-second-dose-vaccination-coverage-101629397088807.html
20-08-2021||Delhi||No evidence to convict Shashi Tharoor in Sunanda Pushkar’s death, says court||Criminal trials require evidence and there was none to convict Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, according to a Delhi court that acquitted the MP of charges that included abetment to suicide of his wife Sunanda Pushkar in its order released on Thursday.The court said it found no material against the politician to establish that his actions led to instigate or aid her in committing suicide, assuming it as the cause of Pushkar’s death, who was found dead in a luxury hotel in south Delhi in January, 2014.In the 176-page order released on Thursday, the court held that the material produced by the prosecution was “wholly or absolutely insufficient” and that even prima facie, there was nothing to show that Tharoor subjected Pushkar to mental cruelty of a degree that would lead to suicide.Even though the statement of the witnesses indicated Pushkar was “agitated”, “distressed”, “felt betrayed” and “cheated” due to an alleged affair of Tharoor had with Pakistani journalist Mehr Tarar, there was nothing shown by the investigating agency to demonstrate that the former minister had provoked, incited or induced her to commit suicide, the order said.It said that none of the medical boards had concluded that the death had happened due to suicide.“In the present case, the deceased (Pushkar) might have felt distressed or mentally disturbed with the alleged extra marital relation of the accused but mental disturbance does not constitute the offence of abetment…,” the court said.Pointing out holes in the prosecution’s case, the court said that while once it contended that the death was homicidal, at another instance, they argued that the death had taken place due to suicide.“Suffice it to say that none of the reports either of medical doctors or of Psychological Autopsy Board had confirmed that the death was a suicide. Even if it is presumed that the deceased had suicidal ideations and she had committed suicide or caused grave injury or danger to life, limb or health as per the case of the prosecution…., there is nothing, even prima facie, to suggest that there was any wilful conduct on the part of the accused (Tharoor) of such a nature as was likely to drive Pushkar to commit suicide or to cause injury or danger to life, limb or health,” the court said.It said the charge sheet was filed with a hope that perhaps the court would find some material to proceed with the trial, but “criminal trials require evidence”.“No doubt a precious life was lost. But in the absence of specific allegations and sufficient material to make out the ingredients of the various offences and on the basis of which the court could, at this stage presume that the accused had committed the offence, the accused cannot be compelled to face the rigmaroles of a criminal trial”.The court found a similar lack of material to convict Tharoor under section 498-A of the IPC, which was invoked by the prosecution. The section punishes convicts for abetting the suicide of a woman by harassing for dowry.Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa for Tharoor had argued that as per the studies on rats referred to by the medical boards, more than 2,000 tablets of alprax would have been needed to cause the death of the deceased whereas there was nothing in the instant case to show that she had even consumed 27 tablets at one go.Pushkar was suffering from various problems including lupus, an autoimmune disorder and was on medication for it, the court said, noting the statements of some of the witnesses who also added that Pushkar would not live long.“The statements of the witnesses also point to the fact that she was disturbed over her health though she was more distressed over the alleged affair of the accused with Mehar Tarar,” it said.The court took note of the AIIMS Autopsy Board report which had maintained that the cause of death was poisoning and due to excessive ingestion of Alprazolam. It had not stated about the death being homicidal or suicidal or accidental.“The Board constituted by the Director General of Health Services had also stated that no definite opinion could be given in this regard. The Psychological Autopsy Board in the first report had stated that the death was not homicide or suicide while in its second report had stated that the deceased had suicidal ideations but did not state that it was a suicide nor there is any other material to confirm the same. As such, none of the Boards had confirmed that the death was a suicide,” it said.The court also said that there is no “quantitative analysis” to show that Pushkar consumed 27 Alprax (a sedative) tablets at one go. “…as per the record itself and as stated by Manishi Chandra, member of the SIT on a query put to him during the course of arguments, there are no studies which could show what quantity of alprazolam would be sufficient to cause death and the same varied from individual to individual.”The court also said that Tharoor did not make any effort so that the messages of his alleged affair with Tarar would be seen by Pushkar, so as to make his conduct “wilful” as was contended by the police.Pushkar’s death January 17, 2014 quickly grabbed national headlines and sparked a political tussle between the then ruling Congress party and its primary challenger, the Bharatiya Janata Party, months before general elections.Delhi Police registered the first FIR on January 1, 2015 against unidentified persons. It questioned Tharoor and others, and conducted a polygraph test on six people, including the minister’s help and staff. Tharoor denied all charges then, calling them “preposterous and motivated”.On Wednesday, the Congress leader said his faith in judiciary stood vindicated and the ruling brings a “significant conclusion to the long nightmare”.“I have weathered dozens of unfounded accusations and media vilification patiently, sustained by my faith in the Indian judiciary, which today stands vindicated,” the former Union minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-evidence-to-convict-shashi-tharoor-in-sunanda-pushkar-s-death-says-court-101629396478349.html

20-08-2021||Delhi||Woman gang-raped in moving car; 2 held||The city police arrested two men who allegedly gang raped a 22-year-old woman in a moving car for over an hour before dropping her off in northeast Delhi’s Shastri Park area and fleeing.Police said the woman alerted the cops immediately after the incident happened on Monday afternoon, following which the investigators nabbed the suspects.A senior police official said that the woman, a house help from Noida, was looking for a job since the pandemic had affected the earnings of her husband, who worked as a mechanic.The official said that one of the suspects, identified only by his first name Rohit, who is also from her locality and was known to the victim for the last two weeks, called her on Sunday and promised her a job at his cousin’s shop in Delhi. He also promised to take her to the job location in Delhi the next day.After picking her up on Monday, Rohit was also joined by his friend, Nitin, a kilometre away.Police said they then allegedly raped her inside car while driving towards northeast Delhi’s Shastri Park.She further said that when she tried to scream for help, the suspects allegedly threatened to kill her if she did not keep quiet.After her hour-long ordeal, the suspects allegedly warned her against informing anyone about the incident and dropped her off in the Shastri Park area.Although traumatised, police said the woman called up the police control room and shared her location.A PCR van took her to the police station where her complaint was lodged, her statement recorded and she was counselled.The woman was also medically examined after which a case was registered under sections 376 (D) (gang rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.“While the woman was being examined, she said that she recalled the number of the vehicle they were travelling in. Using this information, our teams traced Rohit and through him, Nitin. It was found that they had borrowed the car from someone,” said deputy commissioner of police (northeast) Sanjay Kumar Sain.Police seized the car used in the crime and said that the suspects hailed from Noida. “Rohit and Nitin have been friends for quite some time...,” said a police official.The suspects -- jobless but not from poor families, according to police -- were both sent to judicial custody.“The two did not have any case registered against them in the past,” said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/22yearold-gang-raped-in-moving-car-in-northeast-delhi-2-arrested-101629396362317.html

To be sure, the lie detector test is not admissible evidence in court.In the coming months, if other agencies also do not find any evidence against them, the Delhi police are likely to file an application to the court seeking their discharge.“The police did not recover any incriminating evidence or material from them. Only the circumstances and their activities during their day, such as them switching off their phones, speaking over a virtual private network or supporting a group rival to Israel, made the investigating agencies suspects. But the rival group too is not a terror group,” an official said.However, no senior officer commented on the further course of probe in the case.Also, one of the four suspects, Nazir Hussain was staying with his parents at their home in Kargil hasn’t visited Delhi.The four were released on bail by a city court on July 15The National Investigation Agency is probing the case, and the special cell arrested the suspects on the basis of an FIR registered on February 1 under the Explosives Act and seized their phones and laptops.Officials privy to the investigation by the NIA said the agency too has also not found any evidence against the men, apart from the one fact that a seemingly fair man, who resembled one of the four arrested men, was seen in the CCTV footage. “If the police do not file a charge sheet, and if NIA also does not find any evidence, it is likely that Delhi police may even file a discharge report before the court under section 169 of CRPC,” one officer said.On June 15, the NIA released photographs of two suspects involved in the case and announced a reward of ₹10 lakh each on their arrest. NIA is yet to arrest any person in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/israel-embassy-case-charge-sheet-against-4-suspects-unlikely-101629396306570.html
20-08-2021||Delhi||Permission to cut, transplant 6,000 trees for third Ring Road in Delhi||The Delhi government has granted permission to National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to cut and transplant over 6,600 trees for the construction of Urban Extension Road-II, according to a notification by the environment department.The notification issued by Delhi’s environment department on Monday said that around 4,365 trees will be transplanted, and 2,314 cut for the UER-II project by the NHAI. The trees will be cut and transplanted to make way for five stretches under the project, Delhi government officials said.The four stretches (referred to as packages in the permission letters) covered under the project are NH-1 intersection to Karala-Kanjhawala road; Karala-Kanjhawala road to Nangloi-Najafgarh road; Nangloi-Najafgarh Road to Sector-24, Dwarka. Additionally, links to Sonepat bypass, and Bahadurgarh bypass will also be made.The Urban Extension Road-II, also termed as the third Ring Road, which will connect four national highways ( NH-1, 10, 8 and 2) and provide seamless access between north, northwest Delhi and IGI airport and Gurugram. The Delhi government has earmarked an area of 36.45 hectares for construction of (UER)-II in five packages.In December last year, the Delhi government notified the tree transplantation policy under which the construction agencies need to transplant at least 80% of the trees being removed for their project work.According to the policy, 10 saplings are to be planted for each tree transplanted or felled, and the state forest department will maintain a record of applications approved for tree felling on its website.“The benchmark tree survival rate at the end of one year of tree transplantation is 80 per cent. The final payment of the technical agency will be linked to the tree survival rate achieved with a provision for a penalty for tree survival rate below the benchmark rate,” the policy said.Environment department officials said that in lieu of the trees that will be removed, the NHAI has been directed to plant 66,790 saplings of Neem, Amaltas, Peepal, Pilkhan, Gular, Bargad, Sheesham, Arjun and other native species at Aravali Biodiversity Park, Tughlakabad Biodiversity Park, West Delhi Biodiversity Park, Northern Ridge Biodiversity Park and the Yamuna floodplains.The construction agency has also been asked to transplant the 4,365 trees “within the project site at vacant area UER-II along the road proposed to be constructed with their own funds”, the notification said.UER-II was proposed in the Master Plan of Delhi 2021. The DDA, which had planned the initial project, couldn’t implement it due to land acquisition-related issues mainly in Kanjhawla, Najafgarh and other rural villages.To decongest the city, especially the Ring Road and Outer Ring Road, experts say that it is important to develop road infrastructure in urban extensions so that traffic coming from north and northwest Delhi doesn’t have to take Ring Road to reach south Delhi or the Delhi airport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-allows-to-cut-transplant-over-6600-trees-for-third-ring-road-101629396117693.html
20-08-2021||Delhi||In Delhi for treatment, Afghans face rising bills and uncertainty||Fifty-three-year-old Shukriya arrived in Delhi with her son from Afghanistan’s Baghlan province on a medical visa in March to treat her stomach and back cancer. Five months later, her family -- her husband Khalil (63) arrived nearly a month ago -- is staring at an uncertain future as they have exhausted most of their money on the ongoing treatment and the crisis in their homeland, which has been taken over by the Taliban, has dashed their hopes of a better future.“Everything has collapsed back home. We have exhausted whatever money we had and our family members back home cannot send money due to the turmoil that has engulfed the country. My wife’s treatment had to be called off since we can no longer afford the expensive treatment. She is surviving on medicines,” said Khalil, pointing towards a frail Shukriya, who sat on a bed with great difficulty in a poorly lit two-room house in Lajpat Nagar’s Kasturba Niketan they have rented for ₹18,000 per month.Shukriya is among the hundreds of people who have arrived in India from Afghanistan for treatments over the last few years, a period which has also seen a steady growth of medical tourists attracted by the relatively lower cost of treatment here.Since March, Shukriya has been shuttling between private hospitals in the city. Drained by the exacting nature of the treatment and mounting financial pressures, the mother-son duo asked Khalil to come over to India in the hopes that their challenges would ease with financial and moral support. But that was not to be.“We have no money left for treatment or the rent. There are no flights. We are stuck and can only wait and watch,” said Khalil, who is still processing the swift victory of the Taliban.“Everything was okay till a month ago. I had never imagined that the Taliban would take over so soon. We don’t know what the future holds for my wife and family and if we will be able to continue with the treatment,” he said, adding that given a choice, he would prefer to stay in India than return.The ongoing political churning in Afghanistan has thrown the fates of many such medical tourists into uncertainty, with banks in the strife-torn country running out of money and people stepping out sparingly there.Among them is Ataullah (58), a native of Afghanistan’s Ghazni province, who came to Delhi July 29 for his wife’s heart surgery at a private hospital. Amid the crisis “People back home say that there is no money in the banks. I have already spent USD7,000 on the surgery and don’t know how we will be able to sustain ourselves in the country. Besides the treatment cost, rent needs to be paid here. Translators also charge a lot. We are left without resources,” said Ataullah, who too stays in a rented accommodation in Lajpat Nagar II.While many are sceptical about returning to their country, some say they are stuck in Delhi due to the absence of flights. Fear of visa expiry -- medical visas are usually given for a period of 60 days and can be stretched for a maximum of six months -- too weighs on their minds.Mashuqullah Niazai (45), who came to Delhi with his wife for infertility treatment in March, was looking forward to return home but his flight on August 16 was cancelled. “There is a lot of uncertainty since there are no flights. I want to go back but since there is no clarity on flight status, I will have to get the visa extended,” said Niazai.Ahmed Zia Ghani, head of the Afghan solidarity committee, a representative body of the community in India, said that the return of the Taliban had compounded troubles for Afghans everywhere. “Majority of the Afghans who have come to India in the recent months are on medical visas. Those who came here for long-term treatment have run out of money or are on the verge of exhausting their savings. They are unable to receive support since the central banking system back home has collapsed,” he said.According to Ghani, there are around 22,000 Afghans in India, with over 90% of them located in Delhi.“While people are suffering back home, Afghans in India are also in need of food, shelter, and jobs,” he added.Meanwhile, private hospitals that receive patients from Afghanistan said that it was too early to say how the developments in Afghanistan will impact the medical tourism in the country. “Over the last decade, Indian hospitals have witnessed a significant inflow of patients from Afghanistan and adjoining countries, who sought the superlative medical treatment and care available in India. We hope that the recent developments in Afghanistan do not impact those in need of treatment and patients can continue to travel to receive the best medical services in India,” said Anil Vinayak, Group COO, Fortis Healthcare Ltd.A spokesperson from Indraprastha Apollo hospital said there had been an overall dip in the number of international patients owing to the pandemic, including from Afghanistan, over the past year. “It will be difficult to ascertain any change in the numbers owing to the current crisis in Afghanistan,” the hospital said.In a stunning rout, the Taliban seized nearly all of Afghanistan in just over a week, despite the billions of dollars spent by the US and NATO over nearly two decades to build up Afghan security forces. Just days earlier, an American military assessment had estimated it would be a month before the capital would come under insurgent pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/in-delhi-for-treatment-afghans-on-medical-visa-face-rising-bills-and-uncertainty-101629395938301.html

I will file a written complaint with the police after taking legal advice,” Rajak told HT.Rajak further said that the issue was between two groups seeking lease for fish rearing in the pond. Rejecting the allegations, the Congress MLA told reporters that the voice in the audio clip is not his.“The audio clip did not belong to me and it is not my voice. Some people, including a national level leader of the opposition and some senior Congress leaders who are in the government, are hatching conspiracy against me,” said Singh.The MLA was recently in the news when he alleged that his convoy was allegedly ‘attacked’ at the behest of state health minister TS Singh Deo in Surguja district.Singh alleged that the reason behind the attack was that he had praised chief minister Bhupesh Baghel as he said that Baghel will continue to be the CM of the state due to which Singh Deo had a grudge against him.Later, he apologised for his statement against him and claimed that it was an emotional outburst.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/purported-video-of-congress-mla-hurling-abuses-goes-viral-on-social-media-101629395944375.html

The Agra police registered a case against the protestors for violation of Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code and Epidemic Act. “There is discontent and anger among Muslims after a case was registered against the Shahar Mufti and his son for no valid reason. The Shahar Mufti had not opposed hoisting of the national flag on Independence Day and had merely suggested that such flag hoisting should not be at a ‘sacred space’ of the Masjid where ‘namaz’ is offered,” said Haji Jamiluddin Qureshi, who led the protest march. “Shahar Mufti Mazdul Kuddoos Khubaib Rumi has been framed in a wrong and false case when in fact the fault is on the part of organisers of the event, including Haji Aslam Qureshi, chairman of Local Islamia Agency and Ashfaq Saifi, chairman of UP Minority Commission who was chief guest at the event organized at the madarsa within Jama Masjid on Independence Day,” alleged Haji Jamiluddin Qureshi, national vice president of All India Jamait-ul-Quresh. “We have requested SSP Agra Muniraj G to get a case registered against Haji Aslam Qureshi and Ashfaq Saifi who have poisoned the peaceful atmosphere of the city,” added Haji Jamiluddin Qureshi. Sources revealed that senior Muslim leaders in Agra had made efforts on Wednesday night to end the controversy by calling the opposite parties but Haji Aslam Qureshi on Thursday denied withdrawal of the case registered against Shahar Mufti. “The Independence Day event was opposed and Tricolor was insulted merely because the chief guest and chairman of minority commission was from the BJP. I appeal to register a case of sedition against the Shahar Mufti,” said Haji Aslam Qureshi, adding that young boys were called to be part of the protest march in favour of the Shahar Mufti. Police was deployed in sensitive areas of the city as a few markets were also closed in protest. Meanwhile, a case was registered at Mantola police station against those leading the protest and other unidentified people who were part of the march, for violation of Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code. “A case was registered against those who staged the protest on Thursday for violation of Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code and Epidemic Act,” said Vinod Kumar, the in charge of Mantola police station in Agra. It may be recalled that Mazdul Kuddoos Khubaib Rumi, the Shahar Mufti and his son, Hammadul Kuddoos, were booked on Wednesday for objecting to the flag hoisting ceremony organised on Jama Masjid premises in Agra on Independence Day. Organiser of the event, Haji Aslam Qureshi, chairman of Local Islamia Agency, lodged the case at the Mantola police station of Agra. The case was registered under Section 3 of Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 and sections 153-B, 505, 505 (1)(b) and section 508 of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/flaghoisting-row-protest-in-support-of-agra-shahar-mufti-101629395578072.html
20-08-2021||Lucknow||No hunger death due to free distribution of ration: Yogi||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday said people in large numbers had died of hunger during pandemics in the past and this was the first time that no hunger death took place due to free distribution of ration in fight against the Covid pandemic.Replying to issues raised by the members during a debate on supplementary budget in the state assembly, he said people had died in the pandemic in the past. He said a record number of deaths were reported in the world during the Spanish Flu from 1918 to 1926-27. He also referred to the “Sannyasi Vidroh” (Sannyasi rebellion) that later led to the coining of “Vande Mataram” by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee to make his point that the situation of that time reflected on the insensitivity of the then government leading to large number of deaths due to hunger. Yogi said he was thankful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi who worked for protecting lives and livelihoods. He said this was the first time that no one had died of hunger during the pandemic.He gave statistical details about total world population and population of the USA, the UK, Brazil, India and Indian states like Maharashtra and Kerala and compared them to the state to make his point that Uttar Pradesh’s performance was the best.“I wish all of you continue to remain in opposition though I will have to go for campaigning in your constituency if BJP candidate is fielded there and you know the result. But in this house, I can pray for your continuation in opposition,” the CM said.Yogi pointed towards the opposition parties to make his point that some people (without naming political parties) were supporting Taliban in a shameless manner. “How cruel they (Taliban) are to women and children and they (political parties) should be exposed. They have been protecting a dreaded mafia and sheltering him in jail,” he said.The CM said with efforts made by his government, Uttar Pradesh had become the second largest economy in the country with a significant increase in per capita income and the GSDP in the state. He said there was now a change in the mindset of many, who saw a communal angle in the names of Lord Rama Lord Krishna or Lord Shiva, were now claiming to be their followers. Earlier, leader of opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary said various departments had not released the sanctions despite the large size annual budget of ₹5.50 lakh crore. Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Shah Alam alias Guddu Jamali said the state government should not have moved the supplementary budget as a large chunk of funds of the annual budget remained unused.Congress Legislature Party leader Aradhana Mishra said there was nothing in the supplementary budget that was only empty rhetoric. She said chief minister Yogi Adityanath should announce a fund for the victimised women. Others who spoke included Apna Dal (S) leader Lina Tiwari and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party leader Om Prakash Rajbhar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/no-hunger-death-due-to-free-distribution-of-ration-yogi-101629395336564.html
20-08-2021||Lucknow||UP assembly: Yogi announces 11% DA hike for state staff, housing scheme for poor on land freed from mafia||The Uttar Pradesh assembly was adjourned sine die on Thursday after the state government got the mini supplementary budget of ₹7301.52 crore for 2021-22 passed and chief minister Yogi Adityanath made a number of announcements for different sections.The announcements included 11% increase in the dearness allowance (DA) to the state government employees and pensioners with effect from July 1, 2021, a housing scheme for the poor on the land made available by demolishing the illegal buildings of the mafia and the reopening of schools. Besides, tablets/smartphones will be given to one crore youths to make them digitally proficient under a ₹ 3,000 crore scheme.He said schools and colleges from class 9 and above had already started functioning and “classes 6 to 8 are being started from August 23. We are trying that schools of basic education are opened from September 1.”“The leaders of opposition parties were in home isolation during Covid-19…Minister for parliamentary affairs Suresh Khanna is saying most of them were in hospitals. But the state government’s offices were working. So, we have decided to increase the DA from 17% to 28%,” the chief minister said, replying to the issues that leaders of Opposition parties raised during a debate on the supplementary budget in the state assembly here.He said 16 lakh employees and 12 lakh pensioners would benefit from the announcement of the DA hike.As the business advisory committee had recommended sine die adjournment of the House at its meeting on Wednesday, no questions were taken up during the question hour. Speaker Hriday Narayan Dikshit announced that all the questions would be treated as answered with written replies. The assembly’s Monsoon session had begun on August 17.The chief minister said houses would be constructed for the poor on the land made available by demolishing the illegal buildings of the mafia.“We have confiscated/demolished illegal buildings of the Mafia worth ₹1500 crore. We are bringing a housing scheme for the poor at the same land where these buildings of the mafia existed. This is social justice. Those sheltering the mafia had given the state a bad image in the past,” he said.Yogi declared his government was devoting the supplementary budget to the youths and the corona warriors. He read out a couplet calling upon the youths to create a new era.“UP’s youths can now go anywhere and can say with pride that he belonged to this state…We are providing jobs to our youth within the state. We have launched this fund with ₹3,000 crore and we will give tablets/smartphones to (one crore) youths. The youths pursuing the PG and diploma courses will be linked to this scheme. We will also provide digital access to them. We will give allowance to the youths to appear in three competitive examinations.”About the sugarcane dues, he said, “Sugar export is opening soon, and we will clear all the dues before commencement of the new crushing season.”He also said the monitoring committees did a good job amid the pandemic and “anganwadi workers, Asha workers and others worked on lower honorarium in fight against Covid-19. We have increased their honorarium.”He said advocates have been already given social security and the amount given under the scheme has been increased from ₹1.5 lakh to ₹5 lakh. He also spoke about the work his government was doing for the welfare of cows and said six lakh animals of the cow family were in cow shelters.Besides the appropriation bill for the supplementary budget, the House also passed the Uttar Pradesh State Universities (Amendment) Bill 2021 to rename the Saharanpur State University as Ma Shakumbhari University and the Uttar Pradesh Private Universities (Amendment) Bill 2021.Leader of Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary, however, targeted the chief minister for his address, saying he had not replied to any of the questions raised by the Samajwadi Party, the BSP and the Congress members in the House.He also alleged villages had turned into cremation grounds amid the pandemic and the chief minister’s speech was an election stunt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-assembly-yogi-announces-11-da-hike-for-state-staff-housing-scheme-for-poor-on-land-freed-from-mafia-101629394674731.html
20-08-2021||Lucknow||UP diverted ₹65.87 cr from SDRF to procure equipment for Kumbh, observes CAG||The UP government diverted ₹65.87 crore from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) for procurement of rescue equipment for Kumbh Mela-2019 in violation of central government guidelines, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India claimed in a report.The report on general and social sector for the year ending March 31, 2019 was tabled by parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna in the UP legislative assembly on Thursday. According to central government guidelines, the SDRF fund is utilised for providing immediate relief to victims of notified disasters. Rather than diverting funds for procurement of equipment for Kumbh mela, the state government should have made provision from its budget, observed the CAG.The report stated that the state government had mentioned that the Kumbh Mela-2019 organised from January 15 to March 4 2019 at Prayagraj was very successful and over 240 million people visited the Mela. Yet, the expenditure incurred was over and above the government sanctions. As a result, payments to contractors were still pending, it added.There were instances of execution of work at higher prices/cost and non- adherence to the orders of government. Management of solid waste was not adequately addressed.The CAG noticed that the Public Works Department executed six works, costing ₹1.69 crore, related to road repairs and painting of roadside trees without financial sanctions. Besides, the information and public relations department allotted works to the tune of ₹29.33 crore against the allocation of ₹14.67 crore for promotion of Kumbh Mela through electronic and print media.The Kumbh Mela Authority failed to effectively monitor the issue and return of tentage items from various institutions due to which the vendor claimed payment for compensation of ₹21.75 crore on account of missing tin, tent and furniture, stated the report.The urban development department did not adhere to the prescribed timelines due to which 58 permanent and 11 temporary works were not completed by the start of the Kumbh Mela. Due to inefficient procurement process by the home department, fire vehicles, baggage scanners, digital radio HF sets and drone cameras worth ₹7.83 crore procured for the Mela were either not received or utilised during Kumbh.The CAG further noticed that there was over estimation of ₹3.11 crore in estimates for road works, excess expenditure of ₹95.75 lakh on construction of nine roads, short deposit of performance security of ₹6.33 crore by contractors, avoidable expenditure of ₹3.24 crore on barricading works and ₹8.75 crore on fiber reinforce plastic toilet works and excess payment of ₹1.27 crore was made to contractors. Audit scrutiny revealed that three works were awarded to bidders who were not qualified for the bid on the basis of their bid capacity.The management of municipal solid waste (MSW) was not addressed effectively. Due to the inoperative MSW processing plant, there was a massive scrapheap of MSW at Banswar plant site before Kumbh Mela that piled up further during the Mela. Quality assurance in the construction work was unsatisfactory because most of the tests prescribed for quality check were not carried out, the CAG observed.The Kumbh Mela is organized at fixed intervals, the state government may frame norms and standards for quantity and quality of infrastructure and services required for visiting pilgrims.Standard operating procedure for procurement of goods and materials.Expenditure and budegtary controls should be tightened in accordance with rules and laws.Process of selection of contractors/suppliers should be transparent, fair, competitive and in sync with the provisions of financial rules.Waste management, infrastructure and facilities should be augmented at appropriate scale to provide safe, hygienic and healthy environment for visitors during the Mela.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-diverted-rs-65-87-cr-from-sdrf-to-procure-equipment-for-kumbh-observes-cag-101629390834617.html
20-08-2021||Pune||Demolition of middle portion of Pune’s Sus-Pashan bridge begins||PUNE: The demolition of the middle portion of the old Susgaon-Pashan bridge which goes over the Mumbai-Bengaluru national highway near Pashan tekdi started on Thursday. Traffic was diverted from the service road on both sides and a portion of the highway was blocked for the demolition work. While traffic moved smoothly in the morning, a few regular commuters felt that traffic would be slowed down during peak hours.Ajay Wayase, executive engineer, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said, “It will take 15 days to demolish the middle portion. For a few days, the highway will be blocked from both sides. We will start partial (from one side of the highway) movement once half the demolition work is completed. The decision to block both sides has been taken for purposes of safety.”In March this year, 55% of the construction work was complete with 45% remaining. Due to the second wave of Covid-19, work progressed at a slow pace. As on August 19, 60% of the flyover work has been completed indicating that only 5% work was carried out over the course of five months between March and August.“The remaining work is expected to be complete by March 2022. Work on the middle two stands is remaining. All the work is going on as per the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) guidelines,” Wayase said.The special projects department of the PMC is overseeing the construction of the flyover for the NHAI. The bridge is being built at a cost of Rs40 crore with the proposal having been put forward a few years ago by local corporator Baburao Chandere. The new flyover will measure 18metre in width as against the existing 8metre-wide Pashan-Sus bridge which is proving inadequate given the increase in the number of residences and information technology (IT) companies in Hinjewadi and Sus. The new flyover will connect the Mumbai-Bengaluru national highway to Sus and Pashan with a 350metre road from the west side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/demolition-of-middle-portion-of-sus-pashan-bridge-begins-101629388854317.html
20-08-2021||Pune||PMC to raise compound wall to prevent encroachments at garbage depots||PUNE: After failed attempts at preventing encroachments in the Uruli-Devachi and Phursungi garbage depots, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to construct a compound wall to put an end to encroachments in these areas.Ajit Deshmukh, deputy commissioner of the solid waste department of the PMC said, “There are complaints of encroachments in the garbage depots. Hence, we have decided to construct a compound wall to put an end to these. It is a large area and we have limitations in terms of deputing security at the depots.”With urbanisation putting pressure on the city area, people are now encroaching garbage depot land for illegal housing and other activities. The solid waste department of the PMC has found encroachments in some parts of the garbage depot. Despite temporary fencing, people are intruding and stealing metals and parts of machinery.Sudhir Chavan, executive engineer of the solid waste department of the PMC said, “We have fencing for the depot land but it is not up to the mark. We put tin sheets covering the boundary of the depots but people are frequently intruding. We had even registered police complaints but the encroachments haven’t stopped. We have now identified a 1.5kilometre stretch along the railway line from where the encroachments are taking place. We will construct a compound wall taller than 6feet.”“The front side of the depot land has garbage processing plants and sees movement of people so it is secure and no one can intrude from there. However, people are entering easily from the other side of the depot and stealing parts of machinery,” Chavan said.The garbage depots span 163 acre land in the Mantarwadi, Phursungi and Uruli-Devachi villages. The PMC had taken the land for dumping garbage as a temporary arrangement. However for over 25 years now, the corporation is using the land for garbage processing. In 2020, garbage dumping was stopped and scientific landfilling was started on the land.An official of the solid waste department said, “The villages around the garbage depots have merged into the PMC limits and land prices have shot up. With the corporation having stopped garbage dumping, smoke and fire incidents have considerably reduced. Hence, all this open garbage depot land is being encroached as the PMC does not have adequate manpower to protect it. Outsiders have damaged the fencing in most parts.”In 2017, the PMC had assured residents of the Uruli-Devachi and Phursungi villages that it would hand over 25% of the depot land to them. With the corporation using a total 163acre of land, 40acre would be given to these villagers for different purposes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-raise-compound-wall-to-prevent-encroachments-at-uruli-devachi-phursungi-garbage-depots-101629388011169.html

The temple, put together and started by a BJP party worker, was closed to avoid any further embarrassment. On Thursday, members of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) gathered outside the closed “Modi shrine”, seeking blessings from Modi to “bring down inflation and fuel prices”. The sarcasm of the NCP “protest” was more than evident. Mayur Munde, a BJP worker from Aundh, had built the small temple inside his residential premises, saying it was his tribute to the prime minister who “built Ram temple at Ayodhya”, among other things. He installed Modi’s bust inside the temple. Criticism for deification of an individual soon followed. “After becoming PM, Modi has done a lot of developmental work and dealt with issues such as the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir, Ram Mandir temple and triple talaq successfully,” Munde, who is a real estate agent, had said while defending the act. However, when NCP announced a mock agitation in front of temple, Modi’s bust was removed and the temple covered with cloth. NCP leaders, including party city unit president Prashant Jagtap, Pradeep Deshmukh and corporator Baburao Chandere, however, still gathered outside the temple to pray.“One can definitely have loyalty to any leader, but such deification of an individual, no matter who he is, will not be tolerated by a city like Pune,” said Prashant Jagtap||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bjp-shuts-down-modi-temple-but-ncp-s-protest-prayers-still-happen-101629387710950.html
20-08-2021||Delhi||Shoot as many photos as you can: Auditya Vanketesh||Photos always fascinated him as a kid. Today, he has travelled all over the world to capture compelling pictures. Ace photographer Auditya Vanketesh tells us about his love for documenting history, architecture and nature on the go.Question: What was the starting point of your passion for photography and how did you approach it to become the fine photographer that you are today?Answer: In my childhood, we didn’t photograph things as much as we do today, the choicest moments would be documented and became a fun way of reliving those moments. Most of which were times when family got together or we’d travel. I used to sketch a lot younger, and was so fascinated with the medium I would sketch people and then sketch a little negative with it, staple them together and give it to people. So at some point when I wanted to figure what to do with my life, I gravitated towards photography, documenting things I love along the way. Thank you for the kind words, but it’s always a work in progress, trying to learn something new at every opportunity and then apply it when I’m making my next image.Question: Where all have you travelled for photography? According to you, which location is a paradise for photographers and why?Answer: I’m grateful that my interest in photography has taken me all over the world. I’ve gotten to see and experience some incredible things! It’s so tough to pick one place, there’s too much beauty out there! But some of my favourite places have been Sikkim, Gokarna, Rameshwaram, Chikmagalur, The great ocean road, Cappadocia. Like I said it’s really tough to pick one!Question: How important is research on a photography subject?Answer: Very important, as with anything that you want to pursue as a career or serious interest. The beautiful thing about photography though, a lot of the research is in the art of doing itself. The amount you learn from practice and repetition is incredible.Question: Is it important to have right equipment for your subject or you think that passion for the art is enough to create a visual?Answer: Photography is unique as an art, on the one side there’s the creative pursuit of bringing your vision to life, but on the other it’s so tightly wound with technology. So it will definitely make a difference, but that being said your vision is definitely more important. As a professional, it absolutely is easier when you have better equipment, but also as a professional, you learn how to make the best of anything you have.Question: Did you face any difficulty in any of your projects and how did you overcome that difficulty?Answer:All the time, and they are all great learning opportunities. The toughest difficulties have actually not been photography related, but have been things that probably don’t come as naturally to me. Communication skills, learning how to be an entrepreneur, managing money, invoicing, taxes, stage fright, being able to put my vision in words to convince a client, these are things that I still find a challenge in some form or the other every day. The only way to overcome them is to constantly work on it, not be afraid to ask for help, have strong inner circle that can keep you grounded, and constant self-evaluation to make sure that you are you are on the path that aligns with your life goals.Question: What is your take on below mentioned photography myths?•Being a photographer is so easy.I wish it was.•Great photos require expensive gear.Not at all. Like I said earlier, it makes your life easier in some situations, but great photos have been made on basic devices, not so great photos have been shot on the best of cameras. It all comes down to your vision and how your choose to bring it to life with what you have.•Shoot as many photos as you can.Practice definitely helps, and can be a great way to learn. When I was younger and getting to grips with photography, I shot as many options of the same subject/scene as I could to learn. If you think the process is helping you improve then I see absolutely why not. But if you don’t then just take a step back to analyse why. Something that helped me when I felt like that was a neat little trick from Ami Vitale and Ashima Narian in Sri Lanka many years ago, to tape the back of your LCD on your DSLR (of course this doesn’t work with mirrorless cameras because you now have electronic view finders), and shoot as if you were shooting film. You don’t see the images till you come back home, and that teaches you to make the right choices while shooting and not rely on over-shooting without a purpose while hoping to get lucky with one image.•You need a huge portfolio.In my experience, for the kind of work that I do, I’ve found curating the best of your work in 15-20 images works best. And then you have an extended portfolio in case someone wants to see something specific, keep it on stand by so you can get back to them immediately.•Manual mode is the best mode.It gives you absolute control and helps you extract the best out of your camera.•Avoid shooting in bad lighting.Shoot all the time, study light at every opportunity and make light your friend. Of course, some situations will be more challenging than others but that’s the point, to constantly learn so you can make images anywhere.•Always keep the horizon straight.Very subjective, but I always try to.•Don’t put the subject in the middle.Also subjective, it entirely depends on you and what you are trying to show.Question: Any photography advice you want to share with the photographers out there?We’re living in unprecedented times and we’re all figuring things out, so my only advice is to pay attention to yourself and your health, both physical and mental. And don’t pressure yourself to create things you might not want to, to appease the algorithm gods.Question: Your favourite photography quote?You don’t take a picture, you make it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/shoot-as-many-photos-as-you-can-auditya-vanketsh-101629386932906.html
20-08-2021||Other||BJP Tripura MLA calls for ‘Talibani style’ attacks on TMC||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Thursday demanded the arrest of Tripura Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Arun Chandra Bhowmik for allegedly asking his supporters to launch “Talibani style” attacks on leaders belonging to the West Bengal ruling party whenever they arrive at Agartala airport.Alleging harassment at a hotel in Agartala on Tuesday night by BJP leaders following Arun’s purported remark, TMC leader Subal Bhowmik said: “Our West Bengal leaders were harassed last night at a hotel in Agartala where they are staying. The incident happened after the BJP MLA’s threatening speech. We demand the MLA be arrested soon,” he said.Subal added that the party plans to file a complaint against the legislator fromAgartala.“We will write to the director-general of (Tripura) police about all the attacks on our leaders and file a complaint against the legislator,” he said.Arun made the purported remarks, a video of which went viral on social media, at a felicitation programme in Agartala. Accusing the TMC of trying to dislodge the BJP government in Tripura, the legislator said: “...we need to attack them (TMC leaders) in Talibani style. We need to attack them once they land... We will protect our government led by (chief minister) Biplab Deb with each drop of blood.”The tussle between the two parties spread to Tripura as the Mamata Banerjee-led party plans to expand its political footprint beyond West Bengal and spread its base in neighbouring Tripura.At least 14 TMC leaders were allegedly attacked by BJP workers and arrested on August 7 when they were on a visit to the state for preparations for the assembly elections next year. The incident had prompted TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee to rush to Tripura along with Bengal minister Bratya Basu, Rajya Sabha member Dola Sen and TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh to bring back the leaders.Prior to that, 23 members of political strategist Prashant Kishor’s Indian-Political Action Committee (I-PAC) team were booked and asked to stay inside a hotel in Agartala for violating Covid-19 norms in July.Reacting to Arun’s remark, TMC leader Ritabrata Banerjee said: “We condemned the way Arun Chandra Bhowmik said to attack our party leaders who are coming from West Bengal in Talibani style. When the Taliban (after returning to power in Afghanistan) being criticised in the entire world, a BJP MLA is asking to attack Trinamool Congress leaders. We want to know whether the BJP supports Taliban and has sophisticated weapons like them.”BJP spokesperson Nabendu Bhattacharya said he was not aware of the legislator’s remarks. HT tried to reach out to Bhowmik but could not get a response immediately.Subal Bhowmik, the TMC Tripura unit leader, said they will file a complaint against the BJP legislator soon. “ We will write to the Director General of Police about all the attacks on our leaders and will file a complaint against the BJP legislator, “ said Subal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjptripura-mla-calls-for-talibani-style-attacks-on-tmc-101629371685248.html
20-08-2021||Dehradun||Uttarkashi’s ancient Gartang Gali wooden bridge opened to tourists today||The historic over 150-year-old Gartang Gali wooden bridge located at a height of 11,000 feet in Nelong Valley in Uttarakhand’s Uttarkashi district near the Indo-China border reopened for tourists after 59 years on Wednesday following renovation. Gartang Gali bridge, on an ancient trade route to Tibet, is believed to have been built by Peshawar Pathans. It was damaged over the years and fell into disuse following the Indo-China war in 1962 when it was declared off-limits. Uttarkashi district magistrate Mayur Dixit issued an order in this regard on Wednesday. He said, “The bridge has been renovated by the public works department at a cost of ₹ 65 lakh. Those interested in visiting Gartang Gali bridge will have to register themselves at Bhairav Ghati outpost and follow all the Covid guidelines.” Dixit said the repair and renovation of the bridge was started in September last year and completed in July this year. “It was very challenging to renovate this bridge at such a height, given the extreme weather and high-velocity winds. The labourers were tied with safety ropes while they worked on the bridge”, he said The bridge is located inside the Gangotri National Park and is at a distance of 90 km from Uttarkashi district headquarters. The bridge is 136 metre-long and 1.8 metre-wide.Also Read | Cong to provide ₹200 subsidy on LPG cylinder if voted to power in Uttarakhand: Harish Rawat “From the security point of view, only ten visitors will be allowed at a time and they will have to maintain a distance of one metre from each other. Movement of groups or any other activity, such as jumping, dancing, drinking liquor or carrying inflammable substances are prohibited on the bridge,” the DM said. State tourism minister Satpal Maharaj said, “The opening of Gatang Gali trek has added a new dimension to the adventure tourism activities in the state. The bridge has historical and strategic importance and demonstrates the cordial trade relations of the country with its neighbours since ancient times.” Dilip Jawalkar, secretary tourism, said the opening of Gartang Gali is in line with “our strategy to promote rural tourism with better expedition facilities and generate local employment and business opportunities in the associated areas”. Shailendra Matuda, president of the local hotel association, said this will promote tourism activities in the area. “We had been demanding the opening of this bridge since 2017. Now, we are hoping people from across India will come to see it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/ancient-gartang-gali-wooden-bridge-101629359864516.html

20-08-2021||World||Joe Biden pledges to Americans in Kabul: 'We will get you home'||President Joe Biden is pledging to Americans still trapped in Afghanistan: “We will get you home.”Biden's comments at a White House news conference Friday come as the U.S. government struggles to ramp up a massive airlift clearing Americans and other foreigners and vulnerable Afghans through the Kabul airport, rescuing them from a Taliban takeover of the country.Biden is facing criticism for a chaotic and often violent scene outside the airport as crowds struggle to reach safety inside. He called the past week “heartbreaking," but insisted his administration was working hard to smooth and speed the evacuations.“I don’t think anyone of us can see these pictures and not feel that pain on a human level,” Biden said, but “now I'm focused on getting this job done.”Evacuation flights at the Kabul airport had stopped for several hours on Friday because of a backup at a transit point for the refugees, a U.S. airbase in Qatar, U.S. officials said. However, a resumption was ordered in the afternoon, Washington time.As many as three flights out of Kabul were expected in the next few hours, going to Bahrain and carrying perhaps 1,500 evacuees in all, said an official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss military.In Washington, some veterans in Congress were calling on the Biden administration to extend a security perimeter beyond the Kabul airport so more Afghans can make it to the airport for evacuation. They also want Biden to make clear an Aug. 31 deadline for withdrawing U.S. troops is not a firm one.The deadline "is contributing to the chaos and the panic at the airport because you have Afghans who think that they have 10 days to get out of this country or that door is closing forever,” said Rep. Peter Meijer, R-Mich., who served in Iraq and also worked in Afghanistan to help aid workers provide humanitarian relief.Tens of thousands of people remain to be evacuated ahead of the United States' Aug. 31 deadline to withdraw its troops from the country, although the pace had picked up overnight. A defense official said about 5,700 people, including about 250 Americans, were flown out of Kabul aboard 16 C-17 transport planes. On each of the previous two days, about 2,000 people were airlifted.With desperate crowds thronging Kabul's airport, and Taliban fighters ringing its perimeter, the U.S. government renewed its advisory to Americans and others that it could not guarantee safe passage for any of those desperately seeking seats on the planes inside.The advisory captured some of the pandemonium, and what many Afghans and foreigners see as their life-and-death struggle to get inside. It said: "We are processing people at multiple gates. Due to large crowds and security concerns, gates may open or close without notice. Please use your best judgment and attempt to enter the airport at any gate that is open.”While Biden has previously blamed Afghans for the U.S. failure to get out more allies ahead of this month’s sudden Taliban takeover, U.S. officials told The Associated Press that American diplomats had formally urged weeks ago that the administration ramp up evacuation efforts.In July, more than 20 diplomats at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul registered their concerns that the evacuation of Afghans who had worked for America was not proceeding quickly enough.In a cable sent through the State Department’s dissent channel, a time-honored method for foreign service officers to register opposition to administration policies, the diplomats said the situation on the ground was dire, that the Taliban would likely seize control of the capital within months of the Aug. 31 pullout, and urged the Biden administration to immediately begin a concerted evacuation effort. That's according to officials familiar with the document who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal debate.Biden has said that the chaos that unfolded as part of the withdrawal was inevitable as the nearly 20-year war came to an end. He said he was following the advice of Afghanistan's U.S.-backed president, Ashraf Ghani, in not earlier expanding U.S. efforts to fly out translators and other Afghans in danger for the past work with Americans. Ghani fled the country last weekend as the Taliban seized the capital.Biden also said that many at-risk Afghan allies had not wanted to leave the country. But refugee groups point to yearslong backlogs of applications from thousands of those Afghans for visas that would let them take refuge in the United States.The administration has also portrayed its contingency planning as successful after the Afghan government fell much faster than publicly anticipated by administration officials. Yet the White House received clear warnings that the situation was deteriorating rapidly before the current evacuation push.The Kabul airport has been the focus of intense international efforts to get out foreigners, Afghan allies and other Afghans most at risk of reprisal from the Taliban insurgents.White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that U.S. citizens are able to reach the airport, but face an obstacle in the large crowds at the airport gates.On Thursday, Taliban militants fired into the air to try to control the crowds gathered at the airport’s blast walls. Men, women and children fled. U.S. Navy fighter jets flew overhead, a standard military precaution but also a reminder to the Taliban that the U.S. has firepower to respond to a combat crisis.Sullivan acknowledged that there is the possibility of a hostage situation or terrorist attack, and said the government is working for safe passage for U.S. citizens. The administration has committed to ensuring that all Americans can leave, even if that means staying past the August deadline.“This is a risky operation,” Sullivan told NBC Nightly News Thursday. “We can't count on anything.”There is no firm figure of the number of people — Americans, Afghans or others — who are in need of evacuation as the process is almost entirely self-selecting.The State Department says that when it ordered its nonessential embassy staff to leave Kabul in April after Biden’s withdrawal announcement, fewer than 4,000 Americans had registered for security updates. The actual number, including dual U.S.-Afghan citizens along with family members, is likely much higher, with estimates ranging from 11,000 to 15,000. Refugee advocates estimate about 100,000 Afghan allies and family members also are appealing for seats on the U.S. airlift.Compounding the uncertainty, the U.S. government has no way to track how many registered Americans may have left Afghanistan already. Some may have returned to the United States but others may have gone to third countries.Although Afghanistan had been a hotspot for the coronavirus pandemic, the State Department said Thursday that evacuees are not required to get negative COVID-19 results.However, Afghans and the Americans trying to help them escape say the Biden administration has clung to visa requirements for would-be evacuees that involve more than a dozen steps, and can take years to complete. Those often have included requirements that the Taliban sweep has made dangerous or impossible — such as requiring Afghans to go to a third-country to apply for a U.S. visa, and produce paperwork showing their work with Americans.The head of a U.S. refugee organization working to get Afghans out accused Biden of ignoring repeated earlier warnings to speed up the evacuations while winding down the 20-year U.S. combat mission.“The administration’s failure to heed the call of veterans and advocates months ago has put our nation in this unconscionable position. It cannot let innocent Afghans die by bureaucracy,” Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said Friday.Additional American troops continued to arrive at the airport to safeguard and run the U.S. part of the evacuation.

And now rainfall, in an area where rain never fell. Like the heatwave in the [US Pacific] northwest, it’s something that’s hard to imagine without the influence of global climate change.”“We are crossing thresholds not seen in millennia... this is not going to change until we adjust what we’re doing to the air,” Scambos told CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/peak-of-greenland-s-ice-sheet-records-rain-for-the-first-time-101629482326542.html
20-08-2021||World||Chaos grows, evacuations speed up||Foreign powers sought to increase evacuations from Afghanistan on Friday after reports of growing chaos across the country and Taliban reprisals, including against people who had worked with US-led forces or the previous Western-backed government.Nato foreign ministers on Friday committed to focus on ensuring the safe evacuation from Afghanistan of their citizens and of Afghans deemed at risk after the country’s takeover by the Taliban. They also insisted that the new rulers in Kabul would have to make sure that the nation does not become a centre for terrorism.“Any future Afghan government must adhere to Afghanistan’s international obligations… and ensure that Afghanistan never again serves as a safe haven for terrorists,” a statement from the alliance said.Thousand of people still thronged the airport where gun-toting Taliban members urged people without travel documents to go home. Some have fled gunfire in recent days. “As of today, those who may be in danger have no clear way out,” UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesperson Shabia Mantoo said, urging neighbouring countries to keep borders open.The country’s new rulers are not stopping people leaving the country at Kabul airport, a Taliban official said on Friday. “We are only pushing away those who have no legal papers to travel, but who are adding to the chaos at Kabul airport gate,” he told Reuters.The speed with which the Islamist group conquered Afghanistan as foreign troops were withdrawing surprised even their own leaders and left power vacuums. The Taliban called for unity ahead of Friday prayers, asking imams to persuade people not to leave. Residents in Kabul and four other major cities said prayers appeared to have passed off without incident, though attendance was low.In the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday Britain would work with the Taliban if needed after the militants’ capture of Afghanistan. “What I want to assure people is that our political and diplomatic efforts to find a solution for Afghanistan, working with the Taliban, of course if necessary, will go on,” Johnson told reporters.In the US, officials said they were “laser-focused” on “the potential for a terrorist attack” by a group such as Islamic State during the evacuation, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in an interview with NBC News.Germany said on Friday it was sending helicopters to help, while Russian President Vladimir Putin has called on other countries to not impose their own values on Afghanistan and that the reality was that the Taliban had taken control of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chaos-grows-evacuations-speed-up-101629482068825.html
20-08-2021||World||As more people around world get vaccinated against Covid-19, fewer are able to donate blood||From Seoul to Paris, and Moscow to Bangkok, concerned citizens are lining up for vaccine shots as Covid-19 case numbers swell. That may ease pressure on stretched hospitals around the world, but with it comes a hangover - a severe shortage of blood donors.A number of countries don't allow people who have just been vaccinated to give blood, as well as banning those in recovery from coronavirus. With others simply staying home as new infections rise, doctors say donor pools have shrunk to alarmingly low levels, menacing urgent operations.In South Korea, now grappling with record cases, donors can't give blood for seven days after a Covid-19 vaccine shot - and supply is down to just 3.2 days, as of Wednesday, from 6.5 days' worth this time last year, according to the Korean Red Cross.The Korean Medical Association (KMA) has launched a blood drive, starting with doctors themselves, warning that patients in need of urgent surgery or transfusions could face emergency situations, KMA spokeswoman Park Soo-hyun told Reuters."There have been increasing times when hospitals notify us of postponement of surgeries or treatments and crowding due to lack of blood," Park said.Recurrent waves of infections, driven by the highly transmissible Delta variant, and extension of lockdowns have started taking a bigger toll on donations, according to a Reuters review of the situation in different countries.In Thailand, confirmed cases topped 1 million on Friday with authorities reporting record increases in deaths in recent weeks."Due to the COVID situation, not many people are donating blood so there is not enough and some surgeries have to be postponed," said Piya Kiatisewi, a bone cancer surgeon at Lerdsin Hospital in Bangkok.'September worries'Like South Korea, Russia prohibits blood donations from the fully vaccinated - but for a whole month, not just seven days. It also doesn't accept blood from those in the middle of Covid-19 vaccination cycle.The Kommersant business daily reported last week that donor activity in Russia has slumped, hit by the vaccination campaign, with blood service workers in six different regions reporting the problem to the paper.In the United States, supplies of donated blood - already strained by the pandemic - tightened further in the spring as hospitals ramped up surgeries that had been on hold, according to Dr. Claudia Cohn, chief medical officer at AABB, previously known as the American Association of Blood Banks.Under US guidelines, people receiving authorised vaccines do not have to wait before donating blood, but individuals given a different type of vaccine, possibly in another country, need to wait 14 days.To be sure, in western Europe concerns over vaccination-hit donations have been exacerbated by the traditional summer holiday period.France's blood supply agency, the Etablissement Francais du Sang (EFS), said stocks were too tight for comfort. It said there are 85,000 red blood cell bags in reserve, below a comfortable level of 100,000 or more."No sick person will miss out on a transfusion but we are worried for September," an EFS spokesperson told Reuters, when the volume of surgical operations would typically increase.In Italy, the National Blood Centre said there were worrying shortages in a number of regions, including Lazio, centred on the capital Rome, which had led some hospitals to postpone planned operations to conserve stocks for emergencies. It blamed the shortfall mainly on many people being away on holiday and a lack of staff in some collection centres.'Afraid to donate' Across Europe, donation levels have also been plagued by uncertainty over whether people can give blood if they have not been vaccinated, officials in various countries said. Spain's Health Ministry, for instance, issued a call for donations this week, telling people it's safe to donate during the pandemic.In Greece, "People are afraid to go and donate blood to hospitals because of the coronavirus", said Konstantinos Stamoulis, scientific director of Hellenic National Blood Center in Athens. "There are days when there is a reduction of up to 50% in blood donations compared to 2019," he said.Back in Asia, many countries are now facing their most severe outbreak of coronavirus so far amid the Delta variant surge.In Vietnam, the country's National Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion said it could meet only 50-70% of demand."We haven't been able to deploy mobile donor centres," said Le Hoang Oanh, head of the blood transfusion centre of Cho Ray Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's coronavirus epicentre."Instead, we have to call for donors to go to our permanent centres, which is a challenge given the movement restrictions in the city."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-more-people-around-world-get-vaccinated-against-covid-19-fewer-are-able-to-donate-blood-101629479810899.html
20-08-2021||World||'There is no alternative': Russia says resistance to Taliban would fail in Afghanistan||Russia's ambassador to Afghanistan praised the conduct of the Taliban on Friday in the days since its takeover, saying there was no alternative to the hardline Islamist group and resistance to it would fail.The comments by Ambassador Dmitry Zhirnov reflect efforts by Russia to deepen already well-established ties with the Taliban while stopping short, for now, of recognising them as the legitimate rulers of a country Moscow tried and failed to control before the Soviet Union withdrew its last forces in 1989.Russia wants to ensure that the instability in Afghanistan does not spill over into Central Asia, part of the former Soviet Union it regards as its own backyard, and that the region does not become a launch pad for other extreme Islamist groups.Speaking to Reuters from Kabul by Zoom, Zhirnov said the security situation in the capital was much better than it was before the Taliban took control of it and spoke optimistically about the future."The mood in Kabul can be described as one of cautious hope," said Zhirnov."There was a bad regime which disappeared and people are hopeful. They say it can’t be worse so it should be better. But this is another test for the Taliban to pass. After they restore order, they should start improving the socio-economic situation," he said.Kabul has been largely calm, except in and around the airport where 12 people have been killed since Sunday, NATO and Taliban officials said.Zhirnov's comments contrast sharply with those of some Western politicians and rights activists who are deeply sceptical that the Taliban has moderated its violence towards those they see as incompatible with their nascent emirate governed by strict Islamic law.Zhirnov said the facts on the ground had changed and the Taliban had made a set of encouraging pledges."We can’t wave reality aside. They (the Taliban) are the de-facto authorities. There is no alternative to the Taliban in Afghanistan," said Zhirnov.The son of Ahmad Shah Massoud, one of the main leaders of Afghanistan's anti-Soviet resistance in the 1980s, has pledged to hold out against the Taliban from his stronghold in the Panjshir valley north of Kabul.Afghan First Vice President Amrullah Saleh has also said he is in Afghanistan and the "legitimate caretaker president" after President Ashraf Ghani fled.Zhirnov said Saleh's declaration violated the constitution and that Panjshir-based attempts to resist the Taliban were doomed."They have no military prospects. There are not many people there. As far as we know they have 7,000 armed people. And they already have problems with fuel. They tried to fly a helicopter but they have no petrol and no supplies," he said.Zhirnov also questioned the idea that all of the Afghans trying to flee the country were doing so because of the Taliban."Many people now see this situation now as a possible ticket to a new life (in the West) and this may not be related to the Taliban," he said of the chaotic exodus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/there-is-no-alternative-russia-says-resistance-to-taliban-would-fail-in-afghanistan-101629480165243.html

It said the situation in Afghanistan was “a tragedy for the people” of that country and it remains “very difficult and unpredictable,” a statement from NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said.“Ministers discussed a number of different issues. First, the continuing evacuation of people from Allied and partner countries, and Afghans who worked with us. This is our immediate priority,” Stoltenberg said.Earlier on Thursday (August 19), NATO had announced that Stoltenberg would chair an extraordinary virtual meeting of the North Atlantic Council (NAC) at the level of ministers of foreign affairs via secure teleconference to discuss the developments in Afghanistan.Also read | White House not aware of 'precise number' of Americans in AfghanistanDuring the meeting, alongside the evacuation process, the NATO also discussed its approach to the Taliban militants currently in power in Afghanistan. It called on the Taliban to ensure that the country does not become a safe haven for terrorism.“We expect the Taliban to uphold their commitments, and ensure that Afghanistan does not again become a safe haven for international terrorism. The Taliban must put an end to violence around the country, and uphold the fundamental rights of all Afghan citizens – men, women and children,” the secretary general said.Further, it also warned the Taliban of “international isolation” if it attempted to undo the social, economic and political progress in the country.The foreign ministers also agreed that they would not allow terrorists to threaten them again from Afghanistan. “And no terrorist attacks on Allied soil have been organized from Afghanistan over the last two decades. These gains must be preserved. For our own security,” the statement noted.‘Speed of collapse not anticipated’The Nato acknowledged that the rapid collapse of the Afghan political and military leadership, armed forces was not anticipated.“We were clear-eyed about the risks of withdrawing our troops. But the speed of the collapse of the Afghan political and military leadership, and armed forces was not anticipated. There are many lessons to be learned,” Stoltenberg said.He further said that he intended to conduct a thorough assessment of the NATO’s engagement in Afghanistan.Close to 800 Nato civilian personnel had worked to keep the Kabul international airport running, the statement said, following the militants’ takeover of the capital city. They provided air traffic control, fuel and communications. It also said that the NATO had worked “around the clock” to maintain operations at the airport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tragedy-very-difficult-unpredictable-nato-on-situation-in-afghanistan-says-evacuation-of-people-top-priority-101629480054263.html

These countries also insisted on keeping airports, road stretches and border crossings open.Japan’s stand on the new Taliban regime comes soon after Canada made a unanimous decision to not accept the group as the government of Afghanistan. “Canada has no plans to recognise the Taliban as the government of Afghanistan,” Canadian Prime Minister and Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau said.Also Read | Canada will not recognise Taliban as Afghan govt, says PM Justin TrudeauThis stand was taken by other party leaders of Canada as well namely the Conservative Party and the New Democratic Party. Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole tweeted, “I was asked by a caller if I would recognise the legitimacy of the Taliban in Afghanistan. Let me be clear: never.”Trudeau also noted that the Taliban are a “recognised terrorist organisation under Canadian law” and had replaced the “duly elected, democratic government by force.”However, China has said that the Taliban today is “more clear-headed and rational” as opposed to what it was when in power the last time.Also Read| China can play a very big role in rebuilding Afghanistan: Taliban“When dealing with a problem, we should not only depend on what has happened in the past, but also on what is happening now.

Kate Bedingfield told CNN that the White House doesn’t have a “precise number” on US citizens, adding that the current count "includes people who may have left the country, who may have left over the course of the last six months.""What we're doing is working to identify how many Americans are there," she said.The statement comes days after US President Joe Biden said he would extend the August 31 deadline for the complete withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan. The US president has been facing criticism over the rushed withdrawal of troops as the situation rapidly deteriorated in Afghanistan and put the Taliban in virtually total control. After the Taliban captured Afghanistan’s national capital in a lightning push, Kabul airport witnessed chaos as hundreds of desperate Afghans tried to board military planes.The Taliban’s control even before the complete withdrawal of US-led foreign forces has jeopardised the evacuation of diplomats, staff, other foreigners and some Afghan nationals who helped the troops. The crisis has prompted Biden to address the nation on the evacuation of Americans, Special Immigrant Visa applicants and "vulnerable Afghans" at 1pm ET (10:30 pm IST).About 10,000 to 15,000 US citizens are in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, according to The Washington Post report quoting Senate aides."As of a few weeks ago we had already begun reaching out to all American citizens who were in Afghanistan, via email, via text, via messaging app to hear from them, and to understand their plans and work with them to get them out if they want to get out," Bedingfield told CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-not-aware-of-precise-number-of-americans-in-afghanistan-101629474876408.html

The delay was posted on the CDC website and confirmed by multiple committee members.The Biden administration announced on Wednesday that it plans to allow most fully vaccinated adults to get a third shot of vaccines from Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. eight months after their second dose, starting Sept. 20. The plan is surrounded by controversy as the medical community remains divided about whether the data support a need for boosters and the World Health Organization has called for richer countries to hold off on distributing third doses until less-vaccinated countries catch up. Now, with a month until the proposed launch date, the Biden administration still needs the CDC’s recommendation and approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to distribute boosters.“The data are coming in rapidly, and we want to make sure we follow our process for review and to ensure we can have a robust deliberation at the next open meeting,” Grace Lee, chair of the committee, wrote in an email. She said she expects that meeting to happen “soon.” Typically the FDA and CDC would give their thumbs-up before the White House would consider announcing such a plan, and the administration’s decision to push forward without such approval has raised concerns among public health officials. Before the ACIP meeting was delayed, committee member Camille Kotton said on Wednesday that the panel has been discussing the potential for boosters for months, and that the data are sufficient for the Biden administration to recommend them.With such a tight deadline before the rollout is set to begin in late September, even a one-week delay adds more pressure on the White House to meet its ambitious goal.The review comes as US health officials are investigating emerging data suggesting that the Moderna vaccine may be associated with a higher risk of heart complications in younger adults than previously believed, according to a Washington Post report published Thursday. The article cited two unidentified people familiar with the review who emphasized that the side effect still probably remains uncommon.Slides presented at an ACIP meeting in June showed Moderna’s vaccine was associated with a numerically higher rate of the side effect, but that the difference was not statistically significant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cdc-delays-review-of-covid-booster-shots-as-debate-swirls-over-third-jab-101629471800785.html

20-08-2021||World||Afghanistan crisis: Biden to address amid mounting criticism||US president Joe Biden will make an address on Friday amid massive criticism over his administration's rushed withdrawal of troops, being blamed for the crisis the country has plunged into. The President is expected to provide an update of US evacuation operations. In May, the Biden administration announced that the US and NATO forces would withdraw from Afghanistan unconditionally. As soon as the process began, Afghanistan witnessed an unexpected Taliban offensive which concluded on August 15 as Kabul fell to the insurgent group. Since then, the country has been plunged into an unforeseen crisis.This is not the first time that Biden will be speaking about the crisis. A day after Kabul's fall, the US president made an address in which he blamed the Afghan forces for the catastrophe. "I know that there are concerns about why we did not begin evacuating Afghans — civilians sooner. Part of the answer is some of the Afghans did not want to leave earlier — still hopeful for their country. And part of it was because the Afghan government and its supporters discouraged us from organizing a mass exodus to avoid triggering, as they said, 'a crisis of confidence,'" Biden said.Taliban may not announce new government until August 31 as per 'deal' with US: Report"The events we’re seeing now are sadly proof that no amount of military force would ever deliver a stable, united, and secure Afghanistan — as known in history as the “graveyard of empires.” What is happening now could just as easily have happened 5 years ago or 15 years in the future. We have to be honest: Our mission in Afghanistan has taken many missteps — made many missteps over the past two decades. I’m now the fourth American President to preside over war in Afghanistan — two Democrats and two Republicans. I will not pass this responsibly on — responsibility on to a fifth President," Biden said.Thousands of people are yet to be evacuated ahead of the United States' August 31 deadline to withdraw its troops from the country, although the pace picked up overnight. A defence official said about 5,700 people, including about 250 Americans, were flown out of Kabul aboard 16 C-17 transport planes.

No other details were made available by the US side.US President Joe Biden has also been in touch with his counterparts. He spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Angela Merkel on Thursday and UK’s Boris Johnson earlier. Biden is expected to do a videoconference with G7 leaders next week.Minister Jaishankar told reporters after chairing a meeting of the UN Security Council on Thursday that the safe and secure return of Indian citizens from Afghanistan was discussed in a call with Blinken on Monday. The Thursday call was their second in a week.Jaishankar reiterated the continued focus on the repatriation of Indian citizens from Afghanistan in remarks to reporters after chairing another meeting of the UNSC on Thursday. “We are working with international partners. In this regard, especially, principally the United States because they control the airport,” the minister said.US forces have secured the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul to ensure the safe evacuation of Americans, people of allied countries and partners and Afghans who had worked with Americans forces and diplomats and who now fear retaliatory action from the Taliban.Blinken also spoke on Thursday with counterparts of the G7 countries - the UK, France, Germany, Japan, Canada and Italy - and the EU in a videoconference and separately with the Nato secretary general, foreign minister of Spain and the prime minister of Albania, which has offered to take in some of Afghans being evacuated.“All leaders underscored the imperative of safe passage for those who wish to leave Afghanistan and the need for an inclusive political resolution that protects the fundamental human rights of all Afghans,” the state department said in a readout of Blinken’s videoconference with G7 and EU leaders.“The leaders agreed that the international community’s relationship with the Taliban will depend on their actions, not their words,” it added.Blinken has said the US is prepared to engage with the Taliban if they showed respect for basic rights of Afghan people, and specially women and children, and did not harbour terrorists that target America. The US side is actually in daily communication with the Taliban already, over the ongoing evacuation of people through the Kabul airport. Military commanders on both sides are said to be speaking several times a day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jaishankar-blinken-discuss-afghanistan-developments-101629469084848.html

Now demands of resignation||British foreign secretary Dominic Raab defended his actions after major opposition parties demanded his resignation for failing to make a crucial phone call to his Afghan counterpart Hanif Atmar as the Taliban advanced on Kabul last week. Raab’s office was advised to call Atmar to urge him to help evacuate local translators who had helped British officials and the military.But Raab, who was on holiday in Crete, never reportedly made the phone call, drawing flak from opposition parties and triggering demands of resignation."While the Foreign Secretary lay on a sun lounger, the Taliban advanced," said Labour party's foreign affairs spokesperson Lisa Nandy. "The foreign secretary should be ashamed and the prime minister has serious questions to answer over why he remains in the job."Also Read | Afghans in danger 'have no clear way out,' warns UN refugee agencyRaab, however, hit out at the media reports calling them “inaccurate”. In a statement released on Friday, the UK foreign secretary said the call was delegated to a junior minister since he was “prioritising security and capacity” at the Kabul airport for emergency evacuations. But the Afghan foreign minister was unable to take the call, Raab said, as the situation rapidly deteriorated in Kabul.“The whole of Government has been working tirelessly over the last week to help as many people evacuate from Afghanistan as possible. The UK Government’s overriding priority has been to secure Kabul airport so that flights can leave,” Raab’s statement read.The Conservative leader asserted that the government’s approach to “prioritise security at the airport was the right one.” He said 204 British nationals and their families, along with Afghan staff and citizens from other countries were evacuated on August 16 morning, three days after his office received the advice to make the phone call.“Since then, 1,635 have been evacuated. I pay tribute to the excellent team we have in place, and we continue to prioritise what is required to evacuate people to the UK safely,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-foreign-minister-failed-to-make-a-phone-call-to-afghan-counterpart-now-demands-of-resignation-101629467615333.html

Citing statements from eyewitnesses, Amnesty International reported six men were shot while three were strangled to death.One of the victims of the Taliban’s brutality was strangled with his own scarf and had his arm muscles sliced off, according to the global human rights organisation. Providing the graphic details of an incident, Amnesty said a 45-year-old man was taken from his home by Taliban fighters “who broke his legs and arms, shot him in the right leg, pulled his hair out, and beat his face with a blunt object.”The report of brutal killings of ethnic minorities raise apprehensions about the Taliban’s promise of peace and inclusivity in the region. Agnes Callamard, the head of Amnesty International, said in a statement that the targeted killings are proof that ethnic and religious minorities remain at particular risk under Taliban rule in Afghanistan.“The cold-blooded brutality of these killings is a reminder of the Taliban’s past record, and a horrifying indicator of what Taliban rule may bring,” Callamard, who has also previously served as a special rapporteur appointed by the UN Human Rights Council, said.Also Read | Afghans in danger 'have no clear way out,' warns UN refugee agencyAmnesty International believes the killings represent a tiny fraction of the total death toll inflicted by the Taliban as they have disrupted mobile phone service in many of the recently captured areas. It called for the protection of thousands of Afghans at serious risk of Taliban reprisals, including academics, journalists, civil society activists and women human rights defenders.US President Joe Biden, who has been facing flak for rushing the troops out of Afghanistan, also said he doesn’t think the Islamist fundamentalists have changed at all. "I think they're going through a sort of existential crisis about: Do they want to be recognized by the international community as being a legitimate government? I'm not sure they do," Biden said in an interview with ABC aired Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/horrifying-indicator-taliban-massacred-nine-hazara-men-in-ghazni-province-reveals-new-report-101629462318833.html
20-08-2021||World||Taliban may not announce new government until August 31 as per 'deal' with US: Report||The Taliban might wait till August 31 when the United States is scheduled to complete the withdrawal of its forces from the country, an Afghan official with talks with the Taliban said to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. Taliban lead negotiator Anas Haqqani has told his ex-government interlocutors that the Taliban has a deal with the US “to do nothing” until after the final withdrawal date passes, the Afghan official told the international news agency.The country is in disarray after Ashraf Ghani left on August 15 following the fall of Kabul, a day after Ghani promised safety, security and resistance to the Taliban. Since then, the Taliban are in the power of the country but nothing has been formalised on the governance front. First, it was reported that an interim set-up will be in place which will be headed by former Afghanistan minister Ali Ahmad Jalali, but later it was said that after the massive sweep, the Taliban are now looking for a complete capture of the country, without having to share the power with anyone. Jalali too clarified that he was not considered for such a post and neither will he be interested in such a position.'Afghanistan won't be a democracy because...': Taliban leader on how the country will be governedAt present, there is no government in place while foreign forces are scrambling to evacuate their people from the country. Former vice president Amrullah Saleh who left Kabul on August 15 and is probably at Panjshir Valley has declared himself the caretaker president of the country. The Taliban have addressed a press conference through which it sent across a moderate message to the world that the Taliban want peaceful ties with all countries and there will be no vengeance. Women will have their rights under Sharia law, the group said.On Friday, the scene at mosques was uneventful as no Taliban gunmen were seen guarding the entrance of mosques or enforcing dress codes like past. Reports said the Taliban have urged the imams to use these Friday prayers to appeal for unity and to make sure that people do not flee the country.The Taliban on its official Twitter account have announced the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan on August 19 on the occasion of the 102nd anniversary of Afghanistan's independence from British rule.But how will the Taliban govern the country? Taliban leaders Waheedullah Hashimi told Reuters that the governance structure will not be democracy as "democracy does not have any base in teh country". A council will govern the day-to-day affairs while the Taliban aim to refurbish the army inviting Afghan soldiers and pilots.But the latest revelation makes it clear that the Taliban are in no hurry "to govern" but it has also triggered speculations over what might happen after August 31. "Haqqani’s statement raises concerns about what the religious movement might be planning after August 31, and whether they will keep their promise to include non-Taliban officials in the next government. Until now the Taliban have said nothing of their plans to replace the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, or what a replacement would look like," the Associated Press said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-may-not-announce-new-government-until-august-31-as-per-deal-with-us-report-101629462025110.html

Shabia Mantoo, a spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told a media briefing in Geneva that the agency remains concerned about the risk of human rights violations against civilians, including women and girls after the internationally recognised Afghan government was ousted by the insurgents."The vast majority of Afghans are not able to leave the country through regular channels," said Mantoo. "As of today, those who may be in danger have no clear way out."The UN agency called on the neighbouring countries of Afghanistan to keep their borders open in the wake of the evolving humanitarian crisis in the war-torn country. Hundreds of thousands of Afghans have been internally displaced, according to several reports, and many are trying to flee Afghanistan fearing persecution under the Taliban’s rule.Also Read | 'Bomb the bases, then bring out military': Trump's plan for US troops withdrawalThe UNHCR spokesperson noted that several countries have announced resettlement or evacuation programmes for Afghans at risk but full details of these initiatives have not been announced yet.“While widespread fighting has decreased since the takeover of the country by the Taliban on Sunday, the full impact of the evolving situation is not yet clear. Many Afghans are extremely anxious about what the future holds,” the UN refugee agency said in a statement released after the briefing.The recent footage from Kabul airport showing desperate Afghans trying to board flights shocked the world, which, according to UNHCR, spoke powerfully about the “sense of fear and uncertainty among many Afghans.” Welcoming the efforts of several countries to protect at-risk Afghan nationals through bilateral evacuation programmes, the agency said all states must preserve the right to asylum for Afghans arriving through regular or spontaneous means.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghans-in-danger-have-no-clear-way-out-warns-un-refugee-agency-after-taliban-takeover-101629457403895.html
20-08-2021||World||China passes law to curb, regulate collection of private data||China on Friday passed a new legislation to curb and regulate online data collection by private companies, official media reported.The Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), the first such law in China, was passed by China’s parliament, the National People’s Congress and will be implemented by November 1.The passage of the law comes in the backdrop of increasing scrutiny of tech giants like Alibaba and Tencent and taxi-hailing company, Didi, by the Chinese government.The law prohibits “illegally collecting, using, processing, transmitting, disclosing and trading people’s personal information”, according to the Xinhua news agency.The new law stipulates that individual consent should be obtained when processing sensitive personal information such as biometrics, medical and health, financial accounts, and whereabouts of the individual.“When pushing information and business marketing to individuals through automated decision-making, personal information processors should provide options that don’t target personal characteristics at the same time, or offer ways of rejection,” says the law.The law also requires suspension or termination of services for apps that illegally process personal data, according to Xinhua.It also calls for handlers of personal information to designate an individual in charge of personal information protection and conduct periodic audits to ensure compliance with the law.Along with Cyber Security Law and the Data Security Law, the PIPL will create a “…comprehensive legal framework to regulate businesses’ collection, storage and use of personal data and their handling of key data concerning national security, and strengthen the current protection regime”, the tabloid, Global Times reported.Compared to the West, China lags behind in the regulation of personal data, but has been quickly catching up in recent years, experts told the tabloid.The new law resembles the world’s most robust framework for online privacy protections rolled out by Europe - the General Data Protection Regulation, which came into effect on May 25, 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-passes-law-to-curb-regulate-collection-of-private-data-101629457086316.html
20-08-2021||World||It’s official: Couples in China can have up to three children||China on Friday formally revised a law to allow couples to have three children in an attempt to boost falling birth rates.The amendment to the Population and Family Planning Law was passed at a session of the National People’s Congress, China’s parliament, and rolled out measures including tax breaks to encourage couples to have more children.The amendment formally reverses China’s long-time policy of allowing most couples only one child.In 2016, Beijing had scrapped its decades-old one-child policy to replace it with a two-child limit, which, however, had failed to lead to the expected upsurge in births.China introduced the strictly implemented one-child policy in the late 1970s, which, estimates say, resulted in hundreds of millions of fewer births but left Beijing facing the problems of a rapidly greying society.The amended law includes measures to provide affordable nursing services, and also to reduce the cost of births and education of children, such as allowing tax deductions.The measures include cancelling the “social maintenance fee”, which was a financial penalty couples paid for having children beyond the limit.The government will also encourage local governments to offer parental leave, increasing women’s employment rights and improving childcare infrastructure.The decision to permit the third child comes after China’s once-in-a-decade census showed that the country’s population grew at the slowest pace to 1.41 billion until the end of 2020.The new census figures revealed that the demographic crisis China faced was expected to deepen as the population above 60 years grew to 264 million, up by 18.7% last year.The change to the two-child policy did not show the desired growth in population needed to sustain the world’s second largest economy in the long run – a smaller number of young people means lesser demand.Instead, Beijing is now facing tough social and economic questions on how to look after hundreds of millions of elderly citizens as the younger population is set to shrink in the next few decades.China will also be aware of the demographic dividend India has. In 2050, when China’s median population age will be 53, projections say India’s will be 38, a critical difference in the long-term economic race between the two countries.The Chinese government is optimistic. The third-child policy and supporting measures, according to the government, “will help maintain China’s advantage of human resources in the face of the world’s profound shifts unseen in a century”.“By 2025, China will basically establish a policy system that actively supports births with better services and lower costs in child bearing, care and education. The gender ratio of newborns will be more balanced and the population structure will be improved, according to the decision,” a population-related official policy paper said in July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/its-official-couples-in-china-can-have-up-to-three-children-101629453124224.html

In a statement released on Thursday, Trump suggested a chronology for the safe evacuation of US citizens without any chaos, as opposed to the current situation where the Biden administration had to send thousands of troops to Afghanistan for emergency evacuation from Kabul airport.Trump said the US citizens should have been evacuated first, followed by bringing back all “equipment”. He then went on to suggest that the US should have bombed the bases that host foreign troops into smithereens before pulling out the military."First you bring out all of the American citizens. Then you bring out ALL equipment. Then you bomb the bases into smithereens—AND THEN YOU BRING OUT THE MILITARY. You don’t do it in reverse order like Biden and our woke Generals did.

Several women, including human rights activists, have said they have worked hard for their rights over the past two decades and cannot go back.Taliban leaders made assurances that women would enjoy equal rights in accordance with Islam, including access to education and jobs. In the first press conference on Tuesday since capturing Kabul, spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said women would have rights to education, health and employment and that they would be "happy" within the framework of Sharia. "Taliban are committed to providing women with their rights based on Islam. Women can work in the health sector and other sectors where they are needed. There will be no discrimination against women." Mujahid, specifically referring to women working in media, said it would depend on what laws were introduced by the new government in Kabul.However, several Afghan women journalists have said they were not allowed to work by the Taliban. Shabnam Khan Dawran, an anchor at RTA (Radio Television Afghanistan), said she could not enter her office. "I wanted to return to work, but unfortunately they did not allow me to work.

20-08-2021||World||Sydney extends lockdown until September-end as Covid worsens||Sydney’s two-month long lockdown will be extended until at least the end of September and masks will need to be worn outside as the Covid-19 delta variant outbreak in Australia’s most populous city worsens.New South Wales recorded 642 new cases on Friday, Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters. From Monday, outdoor mask-wearing will be mandatory -- except when exercising -- in all regions throughout the state, she said. A curfew will be placed on areas of western Sydney hardest hit by the outbreak.Another four people had died from the virus, the state government said.“‘We’re asking everybody to go through a bit of pain in order to protect lives until we get those vaccination rates up,” Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney on Friday. “There is no simple answer to delta -- short, sharp lockdowns don’t always work.”Berejiklian’s announcement comes as the outbreak that started in Sydney continues to spread into other areas of the nation, which on Thursday recorded the highest daily tally since the pandemic began. More than half of Australia’s 26 million people are in lockdown, including in Melbourne. Victoria state detected 55 cases of local transmission on Friday.In New Zealand, authorities have linked Sydney’s outbreak to at least 30 local cases. While the country’s three-day nationwide lockdown was due to be lifted on Friday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced it would be extended until at least Tuesday.The outbreaks are placing unprecedented pressure on the so-called Covid Zero strategy pursued by both Australia and New Zealand since the start of the pandemic. By closing borders and eliminating cases of community transmission leaking into their countries through strict lockdown measures, the nations have avoided the waves of deaths seen in most other countries.‘Be Straight With the Public’Now, the highly-infectious nature of the delta variant of the coronavirus is starting to make some authorities’ hopes of maintaining their Covid Zero status in the long term look unfeasible. Focus is instead turning on boosting tardy inoculation rates: Bloomberg’s Vaccine Tracker shows Australia has provided both shots for just 22% of its population and New Zealand 19%, trailing most other developed nations.Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been under increased pressure to ramp up the vaccination rollout, which has been hampered by supply delays. The message from his ruling coalition, along with Berejiklian’s state government, has now turned to warning Australians that they will have to live with the delta variant indefinitely.“People have to be straight with the public and tell them there are going to be more cases,” Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in a television interview on Friday. “There are going to be deaths. But we can’t live in lockdown forever. That’s our message.”Other state and territory leaders are warning that New South Wales shouldn’t ease any restrictions while case numbers remain high, regardless of vaccination rates. That’s expected to be a focus of a National Cabinet meeting hosted by Morrison later Friday.Western Australia Premier Premier Mark McGowan -- perhaps the nation’s strictest adherent to the zero-tolerance approach -- has said he’s prepared to keep his state isolated from New South Wales regardless of vaccination rates in a bid to keep delta out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sydney-extends-lockdown-until-september-end-as-covid-worsens-101629431169098.html

A slew of allegations has surfaced against him, including fleeing Kabul with four cars and a helicopter full of cash and stealing $169 million from state coffers.Donald Trump, who was giving an interview to Fox News on Tuesday night, said he “never had full confidence in Ashraf Ghani”. “I said that openly and plainly I thought he was a total crook. He spent all his time wining and dining our senators,” Trump said, adding the senators were always in Ghani’s pockets.The Republican leader accused Ghani of getting away with murder in many, many different ways. However, he didn’t elaborate on what these ways were. Trump also echoed the above allegations against Ghani and said that he suspected that the former Afghan president did leave Kabul on Sunday with cash.Meanwhile, Ashraf Ghani, who is currently in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with his family on ‘humanitarian grounds’, said that he is currently in talks to come back home. Releasing a video statement on Wednesday, Ghani said he was forced to leave Afghanistan “with one set of traditional clothes, a vest and the sandals”, adding he also left the country in an attempt to avoid bloodshed.The former president also dismissed allegations of fleeing Kabul with suitcases full of cash by calling them baseless. “Do not believe whoever tells you that your president sold you out and fled for his own advantage and to save his own life,” he said in the video statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ashraf-ghani-total-is-a-crook-never-had-full-confidence-in-him-donald-trump-101629433565979.html

Reports reaching from Kabul are very grim with gun-toting Taliban cadre playing the Gestapo to segregate and eliminate all Afghans who worked with the National Security Directorate (NDS), army or helped US and allied forces as interpreters.While those associated with the past regime are being targeted, the Taliban are neither sparing children nor women through their heavily armed moral police. Beauty parlours have been shut and billboards and ads with women's faces have been blackened in the capital city. On Thursday as the country marked its independence day, several people were killed when Taliban militants fired on a crowd in the eastern city of Asadabad. The Taliban also fired into the air near a rally in Kabul.Also read | Taliban wanted India to retain its diplomatic presence in Afghanistan“Door to door searches are being conducted by heavily armed Haqqani Network cadre in Kabul and Kandahar to exact revenge by publicly shooting those associated with the Ashraf Ghani regime. Particular emphasis is being paid to those associated with former NDA chief Amrullah Saleh, who now leads the resistance against the Taliban from Panjshir Valley along with Ahmad Massoud,” said a source who refused to be identified from Kabul.Also watch | Afghans celebrate Independence Day in India amid Taliban takeover back homeWhile the UN-designated terrorist group is dictating the people with seized US-made M-4 carbine and machine guns, the political face of the Taliban is trying to negotiate a deal with the US at the behest of the UK and Pakistan to install a transitional government in return for recognition. Adversaries of the US like China, Russia and Iran are already taking perverse pleasure at the humiliation of the Biden regime in the fall of Kabul and are expected to recognise the Taliban government when it is installed.Also read | Taliban conduct raids at closed Indian embassies in 2 cities: Intel“A puppet transitional government will give both the Taliban and the West to sell the disastrous top-secret Taliban-US deal to the public and one of the biggest gainers will be Pakistan, who still has the top Taliban religious leader Haibatullah Akhundzada in its custody. Akhundzada, said to be in Karachi, has not been seen in public for the past five months and questions are being asked whether he will be installed as Emir-ul-Momeen or commander of the faithful,” said a Kabul watcher.Even though it is early days, there are signs of nascent resistance building up to the ultra-conservative Sunni Pashtun force in Afghanistan with the ferment in the Panjshir Valley and beyond Mazar-e-Sharif. However, given that neither US nor Russia has an appetite for military conflict and China works through its proxy Pakistan, little support is expected from Central Asian republics or neighbouring Iran. In the 1990s, it was Russia, Iran and the bordering Central Asian Republics which pushed the resistance against the Taliban regime (1996-2001) before the US intervention after 9/11. This time around, the Central Asian Republics are wary of even giving a base for US special forces for a worst-case scenario in Afghanistan.Also read | China can play a very big role in rebuilding Afghanistan: TalibanWith the power of the Taliban only flowing out of assault rifles, there are huge question marks on their governance of Afghanistan as they have the only experience of jihad and exporting terror.

Canada is targeting to bring in 20,000 refugees from Afghanistan under a special immigration programme. But those figures don’t appear to be attainable at this time, as Trudeau pointed out.“Unless the Taliban shift their posture significantly, which is something the international community and Canada are working on, it is going to be very, very difficult to get many people out,” he said.Canada has said that its focus is on rescuing vulnerable Afghans, including Hindu and Sikh minorities, women, human rights activists and those from the LGBTQ community. At the outset, however, it is looking at bringing out those considered potential targets of Taliban reprisal, such as interpreters and personnel who supported Canada’s mission in Afghanistan.According to the outlet Globe and Mail, Canada’s first rescue aircraft, a CC-177 Globemaster, left from an airbase in Kuwait for Kabul on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/impossible-to-evacuate-from-afghanistan-as-many-people-as-we-want-to-pm-trudeau-101629435602602.html

20-08-2021||World||China can play a very big role in rebuilding Afghanistan: Taliban||China can play a big role in the “rebuilding, rehabilitation, reconstruction of Afghanistan”, Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen told Chinese national broadcaster CGTN late on Thursday in an interview.Shaheen’s interview was broadcast within hours of the Chinese foreign ministry saying that the current Taliban appeared more “clear-headed and rational” than they were when they were in power from 1996 to 2001.The Taliban insurgent group seized control of Kabul and much of the country in the past one week in an upheaval that sent thousands of civilians and Afghan military allies fleeing to safety.According to reports emerging from Afghanistan and experts, many fear a return to an austere interpretation of Islamic law imposed during the previous Taliban rule that ended 20 years ago. Beijing seems to think otherwise and has said more than once that it hopes that Taliban will usher in an “inclusive” government that follows moderate Islamic policies.Asked if the group would implement similar hardline laws to those they enforced in the 1990s, Shaheen claimed international reports of violence against women were incorrect. “There is no subjugation of women, the women are allowed to continue their work if they are journalists, they are practically now continuing their work. If they are teachers, they go to school,” Shaheen told CGTN Europe.He said the Muslims in Afghanistan were happy to be governed under strict sharia law, but reiterated that the judicial system allowed for layers of appeal to protect the innocent.Asked about China’s role, Shaheen said the Taliban had kept up relations with Beijing.“China is a big country with a huge economy and capacity. I think it can play a very big role in the rebuilding, rehabilitation, reconstruction of Afghanistan,” Shaheen said.Shaheen claimed the group has the support of the people of Afghanistan.The Taliban’s advance across Afghanistan represented a “popular uprising against an imposed administration”, he said, adding that the speed of the group’s advance across the country legitimises its takeover of the national government.“It is not an election, but it shows the support of the people,” Shaheen said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-can-play-a-very-big-role-in-rebuilding-afghanistan-taliban-101629434642969.html

The United States on Thursday dispatched the warship USS Arlington to offer humanitarian assistance and the US Coast Guard was transporting the injured from Les Cayes to the capital city of Port-au-Prince.The US government is also coordinating with the Haitian authorities to determine the final death toll and the extent of damage this earthquake caused. As per the US Geological Survey assessment projection, there could be more than 10,000 deaths, news agency AP reported.France has also sent a ship with humanitarian cargo, a helicopter, and 25 soldiers, informed French armed forces minister Florence Parly.On August 14, a strong temblor jolted the country still recovering from the devastating 2010 quake that killed over 200,000 and caused massive infrastructure damage, especially the medical healthcare system. According to a report, 60 per cent of Haiti's healthcare system was destroyed in the 2010 earthquake.The national civil protection agency said late on Wednesday 12,200 people were injured in the latest quake and almost 53,000 homes are completely destroyed. According to local reports, hospitals, schools, offices, and churches are also demolished or badly damaged.Meanwhile, a month-long state of emergency in the four provinces that were most affected by the latest quake.Why Haiti is so prone to earthquakes?Earthquakes occur when tectonic plates in the Earth's crust move. Haiti sits near the intersection of two of them - the North American Plate and the Caribbean plate. The country is also densely populated and its building are not designed to withstand earthquakes, therefore the casualties after the disaster always rise sharply.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/foreign-aid-flows-in-haiti-as-death-toll-soars-above-2000-101629430711592.html

Their sudden victory, which comes as the US withdraws from the country following a 20-year-war, has sparked chaos at Kabul's airport, from where America and allied nations are trying to safely evacuate thousands of citizens and allies."The US military footprint and Kabul now has more than 5,200 total troops on the ground. Kabul airport remains secure and open for flight operations. There are now multiple gates that have access for entry into the airfield, which will help expedite processing in a safe and orderly manner," said Major General Hank Taylor, Commanding General of the Army Operational Test Command.Major General Taylor, who has been given the responsibility to airlift US citizens from Afghanistan amid the Taliban crisis, said in the past 24 hours, 13 C-17s arrived with additional troops and equipment, and 12 C-17 military planes departed.These flights, containing more than 2,000 passengers, left Kabul and arrived at designated safe havens and staging areas in the CENTCOM area of operation, he said."Since the start of evacuation operations on August 14, we have airlifted approximately 7,000 total evacuees. This increase is reflective of both a ramp up of aircraft and airlift capability, faster processing of evacuees, and greater information and fidelity in reporting,” Taylor told reporters at a Pentagon news conference.The US, he said, is ready to increase throughput and have scheduled aircraft departures accordingly."We intend to maximize each plane's capacity. We're prioritising people above all else. And we're focused on doing this as safely as possible with absolute urgency,” he said.At a separate news conference, State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters that there are 6,000 people at the airport right now who've been fully processed by a consular team and will soon board planes."Overnight, we significantly expanded how many American citizens locally employed staff, SIV applicants, and other vulnerable Afghans who are eligible for departure, and we offered to consider transit to the airport. We're aware of congestion around the airport. We are working closely with the Department of Defense to facilitate safe and orderly access for consular processing on the airport compound,” he said.Secretary of State Tony Blinken spoke with the G7 foreign ministers and the high representative of the European Union to discuss the situation in Afghanistan, he said."All leaders underscored the imperative of safe passage for those who wish to leave Afghanistan and the need for an inclusive political resolution that protects the fundamental human rights of all Afghans,” Price said.He said the leaders agreed that the international community's relationship with the Taliban will depend on their actions and not their words."Blinken and the G7 foreign ministers also exchanged views on counterterrorism, humanitarian efforts, refugee migration, and they agreed to remain in close contact on all fronts going forward. Secretary Blinken thanked his foreign counterparts for their steadfast commitment to supporting the Afghan people," Price said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/7000-people-evacuated-from-afghanistan-since-august-14-says-pentagon-101629424504801.html

Facebook’s security policy head Nathaniel Gleicher tweeted on Thursday that the social media company has temporarily removed the ability for people to view or search the friends' lists of accounts in Afghanistan. Facebook launched a "one-click tool" for users in Afghanistan to lock down their accounts, Gleicher also said. This means that people who are not their Facebook friends would not be able to see their timeline posts or share their profile photos.Twitter Inc said it was in touch with civil society partners to provide support to groups in Afghanistan. It is working with the Internet Archive to expedite direct requests to remove archived tweets, Twitter said. Twitter also said that if users were unable to access their accounts, which have information that could put them at risk, it could temporarily suspend them until people regain access and are able to delete the content.

20-08-2021||World||US Capitol bomb threat: Man who claimed to have explosives surrenders||A North Carolina man who claimed to have a bomb in a pickup truck near the US Capitol surrendered to law enforcement after an hourslong standoff Thursday that prompted a massive police response and the evacuations of government buildings in the area.Authorities were investigating what led the suspect, identified as 49-year-old Floyd Ray Roseberry, to drive onto the sidewalk outside the Library of Congress, make bomb threats to officers and profess a litany of antigovernment grievances as part of a bizarre episode that he live-streamed for a Facebook audience. Police later searched the vehicle and said they did not find a bomb but did collect possible bomb-making materials.The standoff was resolved peacefully after roughly five hours of negotiations, ending when Roseberry crawled out of the truck and was taken into police custody. But even in a city with a long history of dramatic law enforcement encounters outside federal landmarks, this episode was notable for its timing — Washington remains on edge eight months after the insurrection at the US Capitol — and for the way the suspect harnessed social media to draw attention to his actions in the hours before his arrest.Authorities who spent hours negotiating with Roseberry — he held up handwritten signs through his driver-side window — were continuing to dig into his background Thursday evening. They did not reveal any details about a motive, and no charges were immediately announced.Investigators had been speaking with members of Roseberry’s family and learned that his mother had recently died, Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger said. “There were other issues he was dealing with,” the chief said, without providing specific details.But social media appeared to offer its own clues.As police continued negotiations, video surfaced of Roseberry on Facebook Live inside the truck, which was stuffed with coins and boxes. He threatened explosions, expressed hostility toward President Joe Biden, profanely warned of a “revolution” and laid bare a series of grievances related to US positions on Afghanistan, health care and the military.Roseberry’s ex-wife, Crystal Roseberry, said she had seen images of the man in the standoff at the Capitol and confirmed to The Associated Press that it was her ex-husband. She said she had never known him to have explosives, but he was an avid collector of firearms.Videos posted to Facebook before the page was taken down appear to show Roseberry at a Nov. 14 Washington rally attended by thousands of Trump supporters to protest what they claimed was a stolen election. One video appears to be filmed by Roseberry as he’s marching with a crowd of hundreds of people carrying American flags and Trump flags and shouting “stop the steal.”Thursday's incident began around 9:15 a.m. when a truck drove up the sidewalk outside the library. The driver told the responding officer he had a bomb, and he was holding what the officer believed to be a detonator. The truck had no license plates.Kelsey Campbell, a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison visiting Washington as part of a class trip, said she and another student encountered Roseberry around 9:20 a.m. outside the nearby Supreme Court building. Campbell said he was with his truck, which was parked next to the sidewalk, and was holding a large stack of dollar bills.“He said, ‘Hey, call the police, tell them to evacuate this street, and I’ll give you all this money,’” Campbell recounted to The AP. “I said, ’No!’ and he threw the money at us and we started running.”Campbell said she and the other student saw some police officers standing nearby. They told the officers what happened, and the officers then went to confront Roseberry.The standoff brought the area surrounding the Capitol to a virtual standstill as police emptied buildings and cordoned off streets as a precaution. Congress is in recess this week, but staffers were seen calmly walking out of the area at the direction of authorities.By Thursday evening, authorities had finished searching the vehicle and determined the area to be safe after not finding an explosive.The nation's capital has been tense since the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol, when thousands of supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the building as Congress was gathered to certify the results of the presidential election.A day before the riot at the Capitol, pipe bombs were left at the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee in Washington. No one has been arrested yet for placing the bombs.The RNC, not far from where the truck was parked Thursday, was also evacuated over the threat. A spokesman for the DNC said its headquarters, which is located farther away from the truck’s location, was put under lockdown, but that lockdown has been lifted.Thursday’s incident marked the third time in as many weeks that federal and military law enforcement authorities had to respond to attacks or possible threats in the Washington area. Officials are also jittery over a planned rally in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-capitol-bomb-threat-man-who-claimed-to-have-explosives-surrenders-101629416975918.html
20-08-2021||World||Study: Efficacy of Pfizer shot wanes faster than Astra’s||The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine appears to decline faster than that of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, according to a new study involving over 350,000 people in the UK, which was published early on Thursday.The study by researchers of University of Oxford is based on the results of a survey by UK’s Office for National Statistics that carried out RT-PCR tests from December last year to this month on randomly selected households.“Two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech have greater initial effectiveness against new Covid-19 infections, but this declines faster compared with two doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca,” the researchers at Oxford University said. The team is not linked to the group that developed the vaccine. The same vaccine is used as Covishield in India, where it is the mainstay of the inoculation drive.The study found that “the dynamics of immunity following second doses differed significantly” between Pfizer and AstraZeneca, according to the university’s Nuffield Department of Medicine.Pfizer had “greater initial effectiveness” but saw “faster declines in protection against high viral burden and symptomatic infection”, when looking at a period of several months after full vaccination, although rates remained low for both jabs.“Results suggest that after four to five months, effectiveness of these two vaccines would be similar,” the scientists added, while stressing that long-term effects need to be studied.The study’s findings come as Israel is administering booster shots, after giving 58% of the population two shots of the Pfizer jab.The United States is also set to offer booster vaccines to boost antibody levels following concerns over declining effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, especially against new variants of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19.The Oxford research also found that protection was higher among those who had already been infected with the virus. It also confirmed that vaccines are less effective against Delta, which was first seen in India.The researchers added that viral load in vaccinated people appeared to now be similar to those infected with the Delta variant, but unvaccinated. “Peak viral load now appears similar in infected vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, with potential implications for onward transmission risk, given the strong association between peak Ct (a viral load proxy) and infectivity,” the report said.But, they add, the degree to which this higher viral load in vaccinated people may translate to new infections was unclear, since much of the virus “may be non-viable in those vaccinated, and/or their viral loads may also decline faster as suggested by a recent study of patients hospitalised with Delta”.“Nevertheless, there may be implications for any policies that assume a low risk of onward transmission from vaccinated individuals (for example, relating to self-isolation, travel), despite vaccines both still protecting against infection, thereby still reducing transmission overall,” they said.Evidence of the waning efficacy rates are also likely to be taken into account by Indian experts, who are studying the need for a booster dose and when that should be advised for people. At least a dozen countries have begun or announced plans to give booster doses to their people, including most prominent Western countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/studyefficacy-of-pfizer-shot-wanes-faster-than-astras-101629397725435.html
20-08-2021||World||Over 10% rise in population in border regions of Tibet: China||The population living along the border areas of the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), parts of which are disputed with India and Bhutan, has increased by over 10%, the region’s Communist party chief said on Thursday.“The population living at the border regions in Tibet has increased 10.5%,” Wu Yingjie, the Communist Party of China (CPC) chief of TAR was quoted as saying by state media at a ceremony in Lhasa marking the 70th anniversary of what Beijing calls the “peaceful liberation” of the mostly-Buddhist remote Himalayan TAR region.Wu did not elaborate on the numbers but added that 21 border counties in TAR are now under direct supervision and aid of central government departments.Wu’s specific views on the importance of the TAR’s border areas of China found support from one of CPC’s top leaders, Wang Yang, at the function in Lhasa.FOCUS ON HARMONY AND STABILITYStressing harmony and stability in Tibet and national security and stability in the border areas, Wang, member of the CPC’s seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, the top party organ, said officials and the general public of all ethnic groups should be mobilised to “forge an ironclad defence against separatist activities”.According to China’s latest census data, Tibet’s permanent resident population is around 3.64 million, an increase of 645,900 or 21.52% in the last decade.India shares 3,488km of border with China that runs along the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh and the states of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh; on the Chinese side, it is mostly TAR.Border area consolidation is among the four major policies that Beijing is implementing in Tibet, the other three being stability, development, and protection of ecology.The TAR party chief’s statement gives credence to reports that say China is bolstering its presence all along the TAR border, fortifying the remote regions not only by building critical civil-military dual use infrastructure but also building villages and populating them.China for one claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern TAR and has been rapidly building infrastructure including the recently laid-out high-speed train line along its side of the disputed border.Satellite pictures show new villages, which have also come up across the Sikkim border in TAR, a strategic location for India.In July, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited the TAR, the first time as the country’s leader beginning his three-day tour at a strategic border city near the Sino-India Arunachal Pradesh boundary.Xi first visited Nyingchi in southeast TAR, near the McMahon Line dividing India and China, before he took an electric train on the newly inaugurated strategic railway route to Lhasa, the regional capital. The new railway route is of strategic significance as it terminates close to the disputed border with India.SINICISATION OF TIBETAll-round efforts are needed to ensure Tibetans speak standard spoken and written Chinese and share the cultural symbols and images of the Chinese nation, Wang, the Politburo Standing Committee member who oversees policy towards ethnic minorities, said at the same function on Thursday.“He demanded all-round efforts to teach standard spoken and written Chinese language and foster and share the cultural symbols and images of the Chinese nation among all ethnic groups,” the Xinhua news agency said in a report from Lhasa.Wang called for efforts to ensure that religions in China are Chinese in orientation and guide Tibetan Buddhism in adapting itself to socialist society. “No one outside China has the right to point fingers at us when it comes to Tibetan affairs,” Wang said.“Any attempt or manoeuvre designed to separate Tibet from China is doomed to fail,” he said.Beijing says the India-based Dalai Lama is a dangerous separatist and instead recognises the current Panchen Lama, put in place by the party, as the highest religious figure in Tibet. As a mark of the party’s rule over Tibetan Buddhism, Wang presented the Panchen Lama with a commemorative plaque at the ceremony.The event held at the square in front of the Potala Palace, once the residence of successive Dalai Lamas and now a World Heritage Site, in Lhasa was telecast live and featured a four-storey high portrait of President Xi towering over the audience.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-10-rise-in-population-in-border-regions-of-tibet-china-101629379005894.html

What’s even more bizarre is that almost immediately more men joined and attacked Kumar multiple times while he was lying motionless on the arterial road even as cars and two wheelers continued to pass them in the two-way road. Kumar was lying in a pool of blood and eventually a passerby informed the police. The video of the attack went viral on Friday. According to police officials, the Anna Nagar police reached the scene and found Kumar dead. His body was sent for postmortem. A case was registered based on a complaint by Kumar’s son, Gopinath. The 51-year-old DMK functionary was involved in drinking water delivery business. Explaining the motive of the crime from preliminary enquiries, police said that Kumar had given a tip off to police about a criminal named Lenin in his locality. Lenin reportedly often took refuge in Kumar’s neighbour Vinayagam’s house. The police said that this had driven Vinayagam to plan Kumar’s murder with his wife. City police said that they arrested the couple, Vinayagam (47) and Karpagam (41), adding that four people have surrendered in the case- Hari Kumar (21), Sridharan (25), Mohanavel (21) and Naveen Kumar (24). The police have seized weapons including two machetes from them. The police are also on the lookout for Lenin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-held-in-murder-case-of-dmk-functionary-hacked-in-public-in-chennai-101629481026343.html

This is my call,” he said in a subsequent tweet.वर्तमान सरकार इन सभी मुद्दों को हल करने में विफल रही है। जो लोकतंत्र और धर्मनिरपेक्षता में विश्वास करते हैं; जो लोग हमारे देश के लोकतांत्रिक सिद्धांतों को बचाने के लिए मिलकर काम करना चाहते हैं, उन्हें एक साथ आना चाहिए, ऐसा मेरा आवाहन है।Briefing his plan for a united opposition, Pawar suggested that the parties should collectively work towards solving these problems and towards a better future. “There is a need to start a time-bound program collectively and I suggest that instead of tackling all these issues together, we should make a priority to solve these issues collectively,” he added. He also said that they should work towards giving the country a better present and a future.The virtual meeting was attended by 19 parties from the opposition including the Congress.

20-08-2021||India||‘Send him to Afghanistan to protect women’: Union minister on Owaisi’s remarks||Union minister Shobha Karandlaje on Friday took a jibe at All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi for his comment on crimes against women in India, saying that he should be sent to Afghanistan. “It is better to send Owaisi to Afghanistan to protect their women and their community,” Karandlaje was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Her remarks come after the AIMIM chief slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central dispensation on the Afghanistan crisis. “As per a report, one out of nine female children dies before the age of five years in India. There are atrocities and crimes against women here. But, they (Centre) are worried about what is happening to women in Afghanistan. Isn’t it happening here,” he said, while addressing an event on Thursday.Referring to the recent takeover of Afghanistan by the Islamist extremist group Taliban, Owaisi said that Pakistan – that has long been blamed of providing the group with logistics, arms and medical aid, has “gained the most” from the ongoing crisis in the country.“Experts are saying that Al Qaeda and Daesh have reached some areas in Afghanistan. ISI is an enemy of India. You must remember that ISI controls the Taliban and uses it like a puppet,” he added, according to ANI.Owaisi also spoke about the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) taking over the probe into the post-poll violence in West Bengal, saying that there is a “need for investigation.” “In West Bengal, they acted like Talibanis, so a need for enquiry is there. Our workers should get justice,” the AIMIM chief further stated.Meanwhile, several Afghan women, working in government and non-government organisations, including the human rights activists, have said that the Taliban have to take them into account when they form the new regime in Afghanistan. This comes amid the Islamist group projecting a more moderate outlook this time around, assuring that women will be allowed to go to educational institutions for receiving education as well as work. However, they have also emphasised that all these will be permitted as per the ‘Islamic Law.’Taliban spokesperson, Zabihullah Mujahid said that Afghan women would be “happy within the framework of Sharia.” “Taliban are committed to providing women with their rights based on Islam. Women can work in the health sector and other sectors where they are needed. There will be no discrimination against women."Also Read | Afghan women protest, say haven’t been allowed to work by TalibanTalking about women working in the media industry, Mujahid said that it would depend on the laws introduced by the new government in the country.Despite the Taliban's assurance, many Afghan women journalists have said that they were not allowed to work by the extremist group. According to TOLOnews, Shabnam Khan Dawran, an anchor of Radio Television Afghanistan (RTA) said that she couldn’t enter her office after the Taliban captured Kabul and that she was told the changed regime is the reason behind the same.Recent photos and videos that emerged from the Kabul airport also claimed Taliban fighters using sharp objects to beat women and children, who are trying to flee Afghanistan and the rule of the group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/send-him-to-afghanistan-to-protect-women-union-minister-on-owaisi-s-remarks-101629467677400.html

The expert committee has also asked the manufacturer to submit additional data for the 2-dose regimen of its vaccine.Cadila Healthcare Ltd, an Ahmedabad-based generic drug maker, had applied for EUA of its vaccine ZyCoV-D on July 1, based on an efficacy rate of 66.6% in a late-stage trial conducted on more than 27,000 volunteers nationwide, in over 50 trial centres. This vaccine has also been tested on 1,000 children above the age of 12. The company had said earlier that the two-dose regime works as well as the three-dose regime, and has submitted relevant data on this for further scrutiny.ZyCoV-D is a first of its kind DNA vaccine that produces the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 to elicit an immune response.

20-08-2021||India||India’s biggest oil, gas reserve sees 40% dip in production, officials blame Covid||Oil and gas production in Rajasthan witnessed a 40% dip in the past two years due to less extraction, primarily due to Covid-19, officials said, even as the government plans to further expand oil exploration in the region. Oil prices in the country have been on the rise for the past few months due to an increase in crude oil prices in the international market. In some places in Rajasthan, such as Sri Ganganagar, not very far from oil producing Barmer, the price of petrol is close to ₹110 per litre.Barmer is the country’s biggest source of oil and natural gas, and contributed ₹1,904.79 crore to state revenue in 2020-21, down from ₹3,883.22 in 2018-19. This means that oil fields contributed ₹10 crore a day to the state government, whose other big revenue sources are mines, excise, and stamp and registration. “The state revenue from oil declined majorly due to less extraction of oil, affecting the production and crude oil prices, and partly Covid-19,” an official said, talking about the reasons for the dip in the revenue. Also Read | Without checks, government’s palm oil plan may spell disasterBarmer’s Gudamalani area has reserves of 10 billion cubic metres of gas, of which only 30% has been explored. India’s total oil and gas reserves are 28.1 billion cubic metes, according to the petroleum ministry website.The official said that in April, May and June 2020, crude oil prices witnessed a huge fall in the international market. But despite the pandemic, in 2021-22, as the prices and production were stable and crude oil prices improved in July 2021, theexpected revenue was received. “The petroleum reserves are on a natural decline, which is slowing down production,” the official quoted above said.The government, till July this year, has received a revenue of ₹1,193 crore. It has set a target of ₹3,500. The official said the demand for oil has started increasing and the price of crude oil has also improved. He added that enhanced oil recovery techniques are being used to maintain production--all these factors have led to an increase in revenue.However, despite the fluctuation in state revenue, the one-and-a-half decade of oil exploration in Barmer has changed the small nondescript town. Barmer has transformed from a small hamlet into a glitzy city, said Rakesh Sharma, a local political activist.The discovery of crude oil and coal in early 2004 fuelled Barmer’s growth, as oil majors Cairn India and Raj West Power invested heavily, generating thousands of new jobs in a city of 1.5 million people, about 540km from Jaipur. The companies acquired huge chunks of land, jacking up land prices by five to 10 times in a short period. Now, an upcoming oil refinery worth ₹43,129 crore is expected to further hike land prices and bring another round of development in the town. Commercial production will start from the Barmer Refinery by March 2023. The refinery will process 9 million tonnes of crude oil annually. A work order of ₹37,464 crore has been issued for the refinery project till July 2021. Additional chief secretary, mines and petroleum, Dr Subodh Agarwal, said inMarch 2021 the western region of the state received impetus for further development as the third gas plant of the state Rageshwari Deep Gas Plant was ready. “It would provide thousands of new jobs and boost economy of the region further in western region, which was earlier considered backward,” he said.Due to the plant, operational now, the total production of natural gas has increased to 3.8 million cubic metres (mcm) per day (in July 2021) from 2.9mcm per day in March 2021. This would be five percent of total gas production in the country, according to the petroleum ministry website.Agarwal said a refinery and petrochemical complex is also being set up in Pachpadra, Barmer, on 4.813 acres of land which is scheduled to start commercial production by March 2023.“The second wave of the pandemic reduced the pace of refinery work. Till June 2021, work orders worth ₹37,347 crore were issued. Of this amount, ₹8,041.66 crore has been spent,” he said on Monday in Jaipur.“Commercial production will start from Barmer Refinery by March 2023,” he added.n the next few days, he said, Oil India will invest about ₹95 crore to explore mineral oil and natural gas in Barmer. “And upon commencement of production, the state will generate revenue at the rate of 12.5% on mineral oil and 10% on natural gas production,” he said. The petroleum basin in the state is spread over an area of 1.5 lakh square kilometres in Barmer, Jalore, Jaisalmer, Nagaur, Sriganganagar, Hanumangarh and Churu districts. Around 1.20 lakh to 1.22 lakh barrels of crude oil and about 33 to 35 lakh cubic metres of natural gas are produced in the state every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-biggest-oil-gas-reserve-sees-40-dip-in-production-officials-blame-covid-101629460804425.html

The Covid-19 situation in the country is improving with the active cases declined to around 3.6 lakh, the lowest in 150 days.However, the country is witnessing a considerable number of breakthrough infections and a very high proportion of the Delta variant is responsible for breakthrough infection after either one of two doses of vaccination, the Indian SARS-CoV2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) said. But the present vaccination drive continues to be effective in reducing severe disease and death, the INSACOG said.Also Read: India has administered at least 571 million Covid vaccine doses till now"Delta variant is the major VOC in India at this time. Continuing outbreaks across India are attributable to Delta, a susceptible population, reduced vaccine effectiveness in blocking transmission, and opportunities for transmission," the INSACOG said.Kerala, which is still a cause for concern with over 20,000 cases, reported thousands of breakthrough infections. This triggered apprehension whether any new variant is active in the state. While investigations for any new variant is on, the experts have said that so far it is Delta that is still driving the Covid cases in India. Delta Plus resulted in a few deaths in Maharashtra but the strain is not worrying as there are around 61 sampled detected with Delta Plus since the time the variant was detected in the country.Citing the examples of the United Kingdom, which witnessed 1.2 lakh breakthrough cases since April, the expert group said that vaccination breakthroughs are expected in India as well as they are common during Delta outbreaks.(With PTI Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/breakthrough-covid-infections-expected-in-india-reproduction-rate-drops-below-1-101629458711386.html

He first held closed-door meetings with state unit office bearers, chiefs of all 13 districts, and state youth wing presidents and general secretaries. Nadda later met parliamentarians and legislators for close to an hour before meeting state Cabinet ministers and chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami.People aware of the matter said the major focus was on ensuring the BJP retains its 50 plus seats in the 70-member state assembly.

20-08-2021||India||Facebook, Instagram remove Rahul Gandhi's post with Delhi rape victim's kin||Content posted by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi that revealed the identity of the family of a minor gangrape victim from northwest Delhi have been removed by Facebook and the photo-sharing app Instagram owned by it. The move came days after microblogging platform Twitter took similar steps as child rights body National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) intensified its glare on the issue.Facebook said the posts violated its policies. “We have taken action to remove the content as it was in violation of our policies,” a spokesperson of the platform said on Friday.Also read | BJP slams Rahul over photo of Dalit rape victim’s familyFacebook has reportedly informed Gandhi and NCPCR about the removal of the posts from both the platforms.Earlier this week, Facebook had written to Gandhi urging him to remove the said post from Instagram.After issuing a notice to Twitter over Gandhi’s post, NCPCR had asked Facebook, last week, to take appropriate action against the Wayanad MP’s Instagram profile over violation of provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, and the Indian Penal Code. It further demanded the removal of the video from the platform.Following the communication from Facebook to Gandhi earlier this week, NCPCR withdrew its direction to the company to appear before the commission with an explanation over non-action regarding Gandhi's post.Gandhi had stirred a controversy after sharing an image of his meeting with the parents of the nine-year-old girl earlier this month on social media. Along with the photo, he had written he was with them on the path to justice and "will not back down even an inch".Soon after, NCPCR took up the matter and BJP leaders accused him of politicising the tragedy.Twitter had locked accounts of Gandhi as well as many other Congress leaders who tweeted the controversial post. Gandhi then took to Instagram and said he was guilty if fighting for justice for a rape and murder victim is a crime. “If showing compassion and empathy is a crime. I am guilty.”On August 14, Twitter restored Gandhi's account after the Congress leader submitted a consent letter from the family of the victim.Twitter, however, continues to withhold the tweets that contain the images saying they violate Indian laws."As part of the appeal process, @RahulGandhi (the official Twitter handle of Rahul Gandhi) has submitted a copy of the formal consent/authorisation letter to use the referenced image via our India Grievance Channel," Twitter spokesperson had said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-instagram-remove-rahul-gandhi-s-post-with-delhi-rape-victim-s-kin-101629456481686.html
20-08-2021||India||'Seems nothing has changed..': Captain Devi Sharan remembers 1999's Kandahar hijack||Air India Captain Devi Sharan was 37 years old when five masked men hijacked the airbus he was flying from Kathmandu to Delhi carrying 176 passengers in 1999. From Amritsar to Lahore to Dubai and then finally in Kandahar -- the captain was asked to take the plane to Taliban heartland. The hostage crisis lasted for seven days and after India agreed to release three terrorists -- Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, and Masood Azhar.At that time, the Taliban were ruling Afghanistan and the Taliban fighters surrounded the Air India airbus when it was force-landed in Kandahar airport. With the fall of Kabul on August 15, the country is again in the grip of the Taliban. The gap of 20 years in which the group surreptitiously gained power has led to a narrative that Taliban 2.0 may not be as ruthless as the Taliban which reigned between 1996 and 2001. But for Captain Devi Sharan who had a first-hand experience in the land of the Taliban as a hostage, it is all the same. "People who have surrounded our aircraft weren't polished," he said to news agency ANI remembering the Kandahar hijack.Also Read | Taliban conduct raids at closed Indian embassies in 2 cities: Intel"I don't think there is any difference between old and new Taliban. The only difference is that maybe now they are a little educated," the captain said."The kind of behaviour we faced 20 years ago, it is difficult to believe how the future will be. But definitely, we had a very bad time in Kandahar... That time they were not listening to us. Their only motive was that their demands were fulfilled. We knew that we cannot come out of the situation without accepting their demands," he said.In 1999, the hijacked plane and people on board are the only people at Kandahar, but now one can see a crowd at the Kabul airport, Devi Sharan said. "Definitely, these people are desperate to come out just like we wanted to come out," he told news agency PTI."They are roaming around in open jeeps with rocket launchers on Kabul streets, just like they did when they were surrounding our aircraft in Kandahar. It was as if nothing has changed," Devi Sharan said.Since their takeover of the country, the Taliban have been attempting an image makeover. As they reached Kabul onAugust 15, they announced that they would not capture Kabul by force. The Taliban have addressed a press conference early this week and said they want peaceful ties with all countries. There will be no revenge, women will have their rights in the new regime etc.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/seems-nothing-has-changed-captain-devi-sharan-remembers-1999-s-kandahar-hijack-101629454317239.html

A photo of the man carrying an assault rifle has surfaced on social media following which such speculations have been rife. The possibility is not ruled out, police said but have not confirmed whether the image that is being circulated after the fall of Kabul on August 15 is that of Noor Mohammad. The photo reached the police through his friends in Nagpur, who are claiming that the man in the photograph is Noor."The man, Noor Mohammad Ajiz Mohammad, 30, was found staying in Nagpur for the last 10 years illegally. He was living in a rented place in the Dighori area of the city. Acting on a tip-off, the police had started keeping a watch on his activities. He was finally nabbed and deported to Afghanistan on June 23," the official said.'Seems nothing has changed..': Captain Devi Sharan remembers Kandahar hijackReports said the man had come to India in 2010 on a six-month tourist visa and was staying in Nagpur. After his visa expired, he applied to the United Nations Human Rights Council seeking refugee status, but his application was rejected. Since then, he has stayed in Nagpur illegally.In Nagpur Police's earlier probe, it was revealed that Noor Mohammad's original name is Abdul Haque and his brother was working with the Taliban. He was active on social media and had posted a photo carrying a sharp-edged weapon. The account that he used to handle was following some terrorists, police claimed. Police said deporting him was a better option as registering an offence against him would have prolonged his stay in India.After he was nabbed, police found "entry and exit wounds" from a gunshot near Noor's left shoulder. "He was in the business of selling blankets and was unmarried. Police conducted searches at his rented accommodation, but did not find anything suspicious," the senior official said.(With PTI Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghan-man-who-stayed-in-nagpur-for-10-years-might-have-joined-taiban-say-cops-101629450081980.html

20-08-2021||India||Two members of Hizbul hit squad killed in Kashmir||Two members of the “hit squad” of Jammu and Kashmir’s (J&K)’s largest indigenous insurgent group Hizbul Mujahideen were killed in an exchange of fire with security forces at Khrew in Pulwama district on Friday, police said.A police spokesman said the squad was involved in the killing of a school peon last month and many other incidents of violence in the Pulwama district.The two were killed amid a spike in violence in the Valley that has left 10 people including a policeman dead this month. A worker of the Apni Party, which was floated after the revocation of J&K’s semi-autonomous status in 2019, was killed in Kulgam on Thursday. As many as 23 workers and functionaries belonging to the Bharatiya Janata Party, including three this month, have been killed in the Valley over the last two years. In a statement, the J&K Police identified the slain as Musaib Mushtaq and Muzamil Ahmad Rather. “An AK rifle and pistol was recovered from the slain militants.”This was the latest in a series of gunfights as security forces have intensified counter-insurgency operations in the Valley and killed 91 militants in Kashmir so far this year. This month, five militants have been killed in separate operations.Défense ministry spokesman Emran Mosavi said that operation in Khrew was launched at 1:00 am. “They (security forces) drew a heavy volume of fire from terrorists hiding in the village. The forces quickly isolated the house(where they were holed up), ensuring that other innocent civilians were not caught in the crossfire. The terrorists were asked to surrender time and again but refused. Intermittent exchange of fire continued throughout the night.”He said that around 6:30 am, one of the two tried to escape from the house by firing on the troops, but he was soon neutralised. “The second terrorist was contained in the house by the troops on the ground and was later neutralised.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-militants-killed-in-an-encounter-in-kashmir-s-pulwama-101629442743231.html
20-08-2021||India||Dry fruit supplies hit badly as Taliban halt trade with India||Dry fruit supplies in the country have been hit badly after the Taliban halted trade with India after taking power in the country last week. India imported 85% of dry fruits from Afghanistan in the last financial year. Imports worth $550 million from that country largely included apples and dry fruits in 2020-21.“As of now, the Taliban have stopped movement of cargo to Pakistan, so virtually imports have been stopped,” said Federation of Indian Export Organisation director-general Ajay Sahai.Rajinder Shah, a dry fruits trader in Mumbai, said since the Taliban took over, not even one truck of dry fruits arrived at the Wagah border (Amritsar) via Pakistan. Dry fruits to India from Afghanistan are also imported via Iran’s Chabahar.Shah said nearly 200 trucks that were to arrive have been halted and caused a loss of lakhs of rupees to importers.The dry fruit rates have been fluctuating since the Taliban began closing in on Kabul. Traders said there has been an increase of ₹200 per kilogram of almonds, figs, apricots, and raisins. Pistachio prices have risen by ₹250 per kilogram.“Not just supply but sentiments decide the prices too,” said another importer Sunil Chabbria. He added it is too premature to discuss how the situation will unfold. “Our suppliers in Afghanistan are saying that hopefully everything will be normally exported soon.”Vijay Kumar Bhuta, president, Dry Fruit Traders Association, Mumbai, said the closure of banks in Afghanistan has also added to their woes. He added Afghan exporters say the stocks are available in abundance, but they are waiting for the deadlock to end. “(Limited) stocks are available in India right now... By September beginning, new stocks arrive. With this thought, everyone was trying to self-off their old stock to buy the new one.”Bhuta said normally in winter dry fruits sales increase and if the ban stays, the loss will be enormous for India as well as Afghanistan. “It is only India which imports so much dry fruits from them.” Bhuta said Mumbai alone has 40 big companies importing dry fruits from Afghanistan. He added almost 38,000 metric tonnes of dry fruits are imported annually from Afghanistan worst almost $650 million.Another Mumbai importer, who identified himself as Raj, said Afghan suppliers have told them the Taliban have assured them that there would be “no disturbance” to trade. “No one wants to transport cargo through roads governed by them (Taliban) right now...” Raj added like many traders he has paid advance money to suppliers in Afghanistan.Jitender Ashar, a trader, said there has been a 15% increase in dry fruit prices ahead of major festivals such as Diwali when their sales go up.Shah said the current stock is not going last beyond 15 days. “There might even be an increase of 40% (in prices) and this too would not come down immediately even if the trade is restored. It is a journey of 8 to 10 days from here to Afghanistan and even after trade revival, it will take time to replenish the stocks.”Shah said they do not know whatever the export document the Taliban will issue will be accepted here or not. He added over 30,000 trucks of dry fruits come to India each year. “Besides this, fresh fruits like pomegranate, cherry also come in around 20,000 trucks. This too is halted,” he said. “Much of this includes perishable items.”The Union commerce ministry officials did not also respond to calls from HT for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dry-fruit-supplies-hit-badly-as-taliban-halt-trade-with-india-101629440223013.html

It further said it was "imperative" to ensure all sections of the population, including children, were vaccinated against the virus at the earliest."To ultimately achieve herd immunity it is imperative that COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials continue to move forward in this population, and we remain deeply committed to the critical work needed to make our COVID-19 vaccine equitably accessible for all age groups," the statement added.Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose vaccine was granted approval for emergency use in India on August 7 after applying for approval from CDSCO on August 5. It had made the submission based on "topline efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE clinical trial". The trials had showed the single-shot vaccine was 85 per cent effective in preventing severe cases of coronavirus disease across all the regions that were studied.The vaccine also demonstrated protection against coronavirus-related hospitalisation and death, beginning 28 days after vaccination.Before this, the company had withdrawn its proposal seeking accelerated approval of its Covid-19 vaccine in the country, without giving additional details.The government had earlier said inoculation of children against the virus is likely to begin very soon. On Thursday, Bharat Biotech’s managing director Krishna Ella said the trial phase of clinical studies in volunteers in the 2-18 age group has been completed and the vaccination drive may start as early September.There are two vaccine candidates that have been tested among children in India: Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Zydus Cadila’s ZyCov-D. The Covaxin trial includes 525 volunteers while ZyCov-D’s trials – as part of the phase II/III clinical studies – includes 1,000 volunteers in the 12-18 age group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/johnson-johnson-submits-plea-for-study-of-covid-19-vaccine-on-adolescents-101629439652481.html
20-08-2021||India||Assam govt renames ‘foreigner’ detention centres to ‘transit camps’||The Assam government has renamed detention centres, which house persons declared foreigners or suspected to be illegal immigrants, as transit camps. A notification in this regard, issued on August 17 by Niraj Verma, principal secretary, home and political department, mentioned that the “nomenclature of detention centre is changed to transit camp for detention purpose”. Sources in the government, on condition of anonymity, stated that the decision was made by the state’s second Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government headed by Himanta Biswa Sarma in order to make the detention centres sound humane. “This is just a change of name and nothing much needs to be read into it. Detention centres sound like concentration camps, while in reality they are not. Hence, it order make it sound more humane, the name was changed,” said a senior official. Also Read | ‘Didn’t compromise my father’s ideology’: Sushmita Dev after reaching home as TMC memberAt present there are six detention centres located inside Dibrugarh, Kokrajhar, Goalpara, Jorhat, Tezpur and Silchar jails. A new facility meant exclusively for those declared foreigners by foreigners’ tribunals or those suspected to be illegal immigrants that can house nearly 3,000 inmates is nearing completion at Matia in Goalpara district. “Transit camp means it’s a place where people stay temporarily and leave. The government has to clarify how changing the name of detention centres to transit camps affect the detainees or the legality behind the change in nomenclature,” said Bobbeeta Sharma, media in-charge of Congress in Assam. Most detainees in the detention centres are from Bangladesh. But since India doesn’t have any repatriation treaty with the neighbouring country to take back Bangladeshis found staying illegally in India, there’s no surety on how long the detainees have to spend in the centres or how they will be sent back. Last month chief minister Sarma, who holds the home portfolio, told the state assembly that the detention centres house 181 inmatest. Twenty persons housed in these centres have died due to various causes since 2009, he said. Of the 181 detainees, 61 have been “declared foreigners” by tribunals, and the rest convicted by courts for various crimes (they would be deported once their prison sentences are over). The detainees include nine women and 22 children who are housed in the centres at Kokrajhar, Silchar and Tezpur. Of the children, 20 are below 14 years of age, the CM informed the House. The government had notified detention centres in 2009 to house people “declared foreigners” by tribunals till they are deported. The centres were created inside jails as a temporary measure till a permanent place was constructed or found to keep them. Following a Supreme Court order in 2019, 273 “declared foreigners” who had spent three years or more in the detention centres were released on bail. Another 481 who had spent two years in the centres were released following another Supreme Court order the next year. The CM stated that over 136,000 cases are pending in foreigners tribunals, while nearly 300,000 cases have been disposed of. The tribunals have declared nearly 140,000 people foreigners while 118,616 have been acknowledged as Indians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-govt-renames-foreigner-detention-centres-to-transit-camps-101629439923227.html

A Delhi court on Wednesday dropped all charges against Tharoor in the case.Pahwa said Tharoor’s legal team requested the magistrate to keep the investigation papers confidential and not share them with anyone to avoid media trials. He said the media was running a “full-fledged media trial parallel to the investigation”. He said the media have the right to report the court proceedings, but not to analyse the evidence and pass judgement even before the trial begins. Pahwa said the media were doing a disservice to the justice system by generating adverse public opinion.Also Read | Sunanda death case: Several twists and turns in years of investigationThe court said it found no material against Tharoor to establish that his actions led to Pushkar’s alleged suicide.

The 56-year-old man was discharged by the Rela Hospital, a multi-speciality quaternary care hospital in Chrompet, on Thursday. The hospital said he spent about 109 days on Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), a procedure that oxygenates a patient’s blood outside the body, and ventilator support.“He became a living miracle, as none in the country has ever recovered without a lung transplant after spending over 9 weeks with ECMO support. Further, the treatment and care at the hospital were such that Mr Mudijja did not require a lung transplant, even after 9 weeks of ECMO support,” Rela Hospital has claimed.Mudijja tested positive for Covid-19 in April and CT scan before he was admitted to Rela Hospital indicated moderate Covid-19 pneumonia. His oxygen saturation level was at 92 per cent when he was transferred to the hospital and as his condition deteriorated, he required 10 litres of oxygen per minute.Also read | Efficacy of Pfizer shot wanes faster than Astra’s, says study Dr C Arumugam, a heart and lung transplant surgeon at the hospital, decided to put him on ECMO support and the hospital continued the medicare despite the progress being minimal during the initial four to five weeks. “ECMO, traditionally, has been used as an intermittent arrangement until lung transplantation. However, now this team has truly made it a life-saving procedure.

20-08-2021||India||Need system to track tax cases: SC to govt||The Supreme Court on Friday urged the Union government to expeditiously put in place an electronic monitoring system to track all direct and indirect taxes’ litigation, observing this is needed if the government wants to create a business-friendly climate in the country.A bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah said that after the advent of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), it has become imperative to have a system where litigation involving the revenue arm of the government can be monitored to track movement of cases between tribunals and courts.“A technological tool to monitor revenue proceedings and litigation at all levels will ultimately serve the legitimate interests of the government. Bring all the procedures of adjudication under one net so that the government is able to monitor its litigation very efficiently. This is for the benefit of the entire nation and for revenue,” the bench told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Union government.It emphasised that having a monitoring system will also ensure a more business friendly adjudication process. “This will also subserve the intent of the government that it is taking into account the interest of the business community. Such a technological solution will help further the government’s intent to provide a business-friendly climate in the country.”The court, while hearing an appeal by the revenue department in February, noted gross delays in appeals being filed in the matters of indirect taxation and asked the Union government to find an answer to this state of affairs by ensuring that matters which are required to be litigated are litigated with all necessary dispatch and matters not worthy of being pursued are set to rest. In the case being heard, there was a delay of more than 500 days in filing the appeal against the decision of the tax tribunal and the tax effect was at least ₹66 crores.S-G Mehta assured the bench then that a proposal also incorporating technological modalities has been under consideration by the stakeholders to evolve a system of monitoring such cases at all levels of the courts and tribunals.On Thursday, the S-G agreed with the bench that the proposition to have a robust system was well-meaning, adding that deliberations were on to integrate Legal Information Management and Briefing System (LIMBS) with the e-office system of National Informatics Centre (NIC) to ensure that once a judgement is pronounced in any court, processing of the same starts immediately on the e-office system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-system-to-track-tax-cases-sc-to-govt-101629422567185.html

20-08-2021||India||For pandemic-hit Kerala, it’s a make-or-break Onam||The 10-day-long Onam festivities in Kerala will conclude with Thiruvonam on August 21. Onam is the biggest festival in the state that spans religious boundaries and attracts a lot of the region’s migrant workers back home. In many ways, Onam also marks the beginning of the festive season across India – it continues till the Christmas/New Year season. Festive demand has always been important for the economy, but it will be very crucial for pandemic-affected markets this year. This year’s Onam festivities could be a make-or-break moment for the southern state, which after being hailed as a model in the fight against the pandemic, is dealing with what seems to be an uncontrollable surge in Covid-19 cases. It was around Onam last year that Covid-19 cases began rising in Kerala, putting an end to the state’s claims of successfully containing the pandemic. If there is a similar spike in cases this year too, the situation, at least in terms of the medical infrastructure’s ability to cope, may spiral out of control.1) Onam was when Covid-19 infections started rising in Kerala last yearAlthough India imposed a 68-day long nation-wide lockdown on March 25, 2020, to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 virus, the pandemic’s trajectory was very different in Kerala and rest of India in the initial phase. Cases started rising steadily in rest of India as restrictions were eased. However, Kerala managed to buck this trend, earning much applause for its handling of the pandemic. The situation in Kerala changed with Onam, which was on August 30, 2020. A comparison of normalised values of the seven-day average of daily new infections on a scale of 0 to 1 (0 being the minimum and 1 maximum) for Kerala and rest of India shows this clearly, with a sudden spike in Kerala’s case trajectory around the last week of August 2020. The first wave of Covid-19, once it started in Kerala, took longer to subside, unlike in the rest of the country. That the state had two rounds of polls, local body elections in December and then assembly elections in April, did not help﻿2) A festive boost to mobility may have played a role in the 2020 surge and it appears to be happening againGiven the importance of festivals for businesses, governments are always under pressure to relax restrictions. Kerala is no exception to this. Last year, the state government relaxed restrictions before Onam – for instance, allowing people to dine-in in restaurants. This year too, the government announced relaxations both before Eid and Onam. The impact of this is evident in data from Google mobility indices for the state, which show a sharp rise around Onam last year. Of particular interest are the trends in mobility at retail establishments and transit stations, which potentially capture crowding in markets and inbound travel (of potentially infected) persons to the state. Mobility indices seem to have increased sharply once again before Onam this year, even though the Covid-19 situation is much worse. In fact, Kerala is recording more cases than the rest of the country put together. The rise in mobility coincides with the period of rise in Covid-19 cases in the state, both last year and now.A festive boost to mobility may have played a role in the 2020 surge and it appears to be happening again﻿3) Why does the Kerala experience matter for the rest of the country?To be sure, Kerala’s medical infrastructure has not collapsed due the pandemic, as was seen in most parts of the country during the second wave of the pandemic. Daily new cases and positivity rates, while they are still high, have come down from their peak levels in Kerala. Why does the current situation in Kerala matter for the rest of the country then? One, Onam is the first in a series of forthcoming festivals, all crucial for the revival of consumption demand in the economy.Even an inkling of the third wave of the pandemic is bound to crush both consumer and business sentiment and significantly damage the country’s economic prospects. Whether or not Kerala’s Covid-19 cases surge after the festival will be the first litmus test of whether restoration of pre-pandemic mobility levels trigger the third wave. Despite having a higher number of cases, Kerala has emerged as one of the best performers in terms of vaccination. As of August 19, 2021, it has fully vaccinated 19.3% of its adult population and administered at least one dose to another 33.4%. In addition to offering personal immunity, vaccines, once they have crossed a critical threshold, are also expected to slow down the rate of infections. If cases spike in Kerala despite a significantly high level of vaccinations, then one can expect much worse in other states where vaccinations levels are lower . But a mishap-free Onam, at least on the pandemic front, could be really good news for the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-pandemic-hit-kerala-it-s-a-make-or-break-onam-101629416613022.html
20-08-2021||India||NHRC remarks on violence uncalled for: Two HC judges||Recommendations and observations made by a National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) panel on alleged post-poll violence in West Bengal were “non-est” (having no legal validity) in the eye of the law and uncalled for, two judges of the five-member Calcutta high court bench said on Thursday.The two judges -- justices IP Mukerji and Soumen Sen -- concurred with the high court’s order calling for separate probes by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the state police but objected to some portions of the seven-member NHRC committee’s report.“The committee constituted by the NHRC had only power under our order to report on facts, as gathered by them on investigation. They had no jurisdiction to make any recommendation or to express any opinion. We did not vest them with that power . . . Therefore the part of the report expressing opinion, making recommendations etc. is non-est in the eye of law,” justice Mukerji wrote.On June 18, the high court -- hearing a bunch of public interest litigation -- asked the NHRC to probe the violence. The committee submitted its report on July 13 slamming the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government and recommending a CBI probe. It also called for shifting trials in the case outside the state.In its report, the panel attacked the state government and police, saying the clashes were a “death knell” for democracy and alleging that police didn’t have the “courage” to take action against goons belonging to the ruling dispensation.“Although the fact finding committee has made scathing remarks and made recommendations against politicians and police officers, I am of the view that such remarks and recommendations were uncalled for and to that extent the committee has transgressed its limits,” justice Soumen Sen wrote.The panel was led by NHRC member and former intelligence bureau chief Rajiv Jain and also comprised vice-chairperson of the National Commission for Minorities Atif Rasheed, National Commission for Women member Dr. Rajulben L. Desai, director general (investigation) Santosh Mehra, West Bengal State Human Rights Commission registrar Pradip Kumar Panja, West Bengal State Legal Services Authority member secretary Raju Mukherjee and Manzil Saini, deputy inspector general (Investigation), NHRC.In its order, the HC bench said if the CBI or SIT found any case not related to post-poll violence, it must be transferred to the officer in charge of the concerned police station. “It is made clear that any observation made in this order is only for the limited purpose of deciding the issue whether investigation is to be handed over to CBI and Special Investigation Team. Nothing observed shall be construed as an expression of opinion on the merits of the cases,” the order stated.In its arguments, the state government had argued that some of the committee members had a close association with the Bharatiya Janata Party and were deliberately chosen to give a negative report against the state. On Thursday, TMC MP Saugata Roy said, “We stick to our point that several members of the committee have links with the BJP. Therefore, the credibility of the committee is questionable.”But the high court appeared to reject these charges of bias.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhrc-remarks-on-violence-uncalled-for-two-hc-judges-101629416103638.html
20-08-2021||India||Terrorists kill Apni Party worker in J&K||Terrorists shot dead Apni Party worker Ghulam Hassan Lone in his house in south Kashmir’s Kulgam district on Thursday, marking the third killing of a political leader in the Valley this month.Police spokesman said that preliminary investigation revealed that terrorists fired upon the 70-year-old leader near his house in Devsar. “He (Lone) was immediately shifted to nearby hospital where he was declared as brought dead... neither the police records nor the activities of deceased indicated him to be a political worker. Besides, as of date no political party had indicated or intimated about his political affiliation. However, post incident Apni Party claimed that the deceased was their political worker,” the spokesman said.Apni party president Syed Mohammad Altaf Bukhari termed the incident barbaric and conveyed deep anguish over the killings of political activists. Bukhari said Lone was working on the ground for the welfare of people.This is the third killing of a political leader in the region in a fortnight, but the earlier deaths were of Bharatiya Janata Party leaders. On Monday, BJP leader Javeed Ahmad Dar was shot dead by terrorists in Kulgam. On August 10, BJP village chief Ghulam Rasool Dar and his wife Jawahira Bano were gunned down in Anantnag town.Politicians condemned the killing. “Very sorry to hear about the assassination of Ghulam Hassan Lone in Devsar area of south Kashmir. This renewed trend of targeting mainstream politicians by militant outfits is very worrying & I condemn the same in the strongest possible terms....,” tweeted Omar Abdullah, National Conference vice-president.Peoples Democratic Party chief Mehbooba Mufti said, “Unfortunately there seems to be no end to the spree of political killings in Kashmir. Unreservedly condemn the killing of Apni party leader Ghulam Hassan Lone...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terrorists-kill-apni-party-worker-in-jk-101629413619613.html
20-08-2021||India||Afghan embassy seeks deferment of case citing political crisis||The Embassy of Islamic Republic of Afghanistan on Thursday sought a six-week adjournment from the Supreme Court in a contractual dispute case, citing the regime change in the country following the Taliban takeover.“There is a regime change in Afghanistan and the entire country is in a state of turmoil and I am not able to get further instructions from the Ambassador and from the Embassy located in New Delhi. I will be requesting for an adjournment of six weeks,” said the letter, moved by embassy counsel advocate Ejaz Maqbool.The bench of justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari, however, asked: “Do you think the situation will be resolved in six weeks?”Maqbool replied, “We all pray that the situation improves soon… For now, let the matter be listed after six weeks.” The bench accepted the request and adjourned the case for six weeks.The case is related to a contractual dispute between a Delhi-based private firm KLA Construction Technologies Private Limited and the embassy. The embassy signed a contract for its rehabilitation in November 2007 but disputes arose after the firm took over two years to complete only 40% of work, when the contract specified a timeline of 240 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghan-embassy-seeks-deferment-of-case-citing-political-crisis-101629411825635.html
20-08-2021||India||Taliban conduct raids at closed Indian embassies in 2 cities: Intel||The Taliban visited the closed Indian consulates in Kandahar and Herat on Wednesday, searched cupboards in Kandahar for papers, and took away parked vehicles from both embassies, even as it conducts door-to-door searches in Kabul to identify Afghans who worked for NDS, the state-run intelligence agency. Details of what’s happening to the Indian consulate in Jalalabad and the mission in Kabul are not available.According to reports from Kabul, nearly 6,000 cadre of the Haqqani Network has taken control of the capital city, led by Anas Haqqani, brother of Sirajuddin Haqqani, head of the terrorist group and deputy leader of the Taliban.While Anas Haqqani met former president Hamid Karzai, Chairman HCNR Abdullah Abdullah and Hezb-e-Islami veteran Gulbuddin Hetkmatyar, it is understood that the movements of both Karzai and Abdullah are restricted and controlled by the Taliban.Negotiations are on to ensure to get both Karzai and Abdullah to formally hand over power to the Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Barader in the Presidential Palace in a staged event. Sirajuddin Haqqani is said to be passing on instructions from Quetta, where the Taliban’s council of leaders, the Quetta Shura is based.Reports from Kandahar reveal that the Taliban cadre broke the locks of the Indian consulate and carried out searches. They took away parked diplomatic vehicles with them. At Herat, they entered the consulate compound and took away the vehicles without making forcible entry into the consulate.While Haqqani network cadre are largely controlling Kabul, the Taliban faction headed by Mullah Yaqoob, son of the late Mullah Omar and head of Taliban military commission, is planning the take over of power and government from Kandahar, the traditional seat of Pashtuns. Mullah Barader met Mullah Yaqoob after he arrived from Doha on August 18. It was in Kandahar that Mullah Yaqoob’s father was declared Emir ul Momeen on April 4, 1996. The religious head of Taliban, Mullah Haibatullah Akundzada, is still based in Karachi in Pakistan.Although negotiations are on within the Taliban leadership on the formation of government at Kabul, the Pakistan based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), a fellow Deobandi terrorist group, is apparently demanding a stake in the Afghan pie with jagirs or land in south Afghanistan. With the ascent of Taliban in Kabul, there is a celebration both within the JeM as well as their handlers in Rawalpindi as troves of cash and top-of-the-line US weapons and military vehicles have been seized by the invaders.While India and its close allies are in a wait and watch mode, the Taliban are getting support from Britain whose Chief of Defence Staff General Nick Carter is openly lobbying for the Sunni Pashtun group to be given a chance at Kabul.In an interview with Sky News, he referred to them as “country boys ... with a code of honour”. It was Carter and the Pakistan Army that were instrumental in keeping the Doha process alive -- eventually resulting in what is now clear as a sub-optimal deal between the US and the Taliban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taliban-conduct-raids-at-closed-indian-embassies-in-2-cities-intel-101629411618002.html
20-08-2021||India||Delhiwale: The emperors of fresh ice-cream||A moderate crowd of idle pedestrians have gathered about the cart. Their faces are full of wonder. This so-called ice-cream is looking so different from the factory-manufactured nutty-buddy and chocolate-chip. Oblivious to the distraction they are causing on the roadside, the two young vendors are busily slicing apples, papayas, pineapples and bananas. Like in a TV cookery show, they are making their fruit ice-cream step-by-step in full view, which is smelling so fresh, so natural. As if it were not the fruit but the ice-cream itself that must had been growing on the tree.Resigned to the hot, humid evening, brothers Hameed and Aamir are wordlessly operating their “roller machine”, here on Delhi’s Mathura Road. “This is roller ice-cream,” replies Hameed. Both the men are so involved in the production that they aren’t at all registering the curious onlookers around them.The machine works logically, says Hameed after much cajoling as if he weren’t wishing to part with a trade secret. The long cylindrical roller is packed with milk-coated crushed ice. Hameed now slowly pours mango smoothie from a small tea kettle. His other hand is constantly spinning the roller’s handle. The smoothie instantly freezes on the rotating ice, which turns mango-yellow in no time. On his part, Aamir is holding a plate of chopped fruit right under the roller. The pieces immediately cling to the creamy ice. When a customer turns up, a layer is scraped from the roller with a knife and served in a disposable bowl. The very first bite wildly invigorates the senses. The soft fruit chunks implode in the mouth, spilling out all their cold secrets within a moment. It’s thrilling.Sadly, such a delicious delicacy, is so rarely sighted. Equally frustrating are these hard-to-spot brothers. Though they move about with their roller machine only in Bhogal and Ashram areas, they say they have no fixed hours for specific locations. This elusiveness makes their ice-cream even more desirable. Happy sighting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-the-emperors-of-fresh-icecream-101629407838430.html

20-08-2021||India||Monsoon revival begins in northwest India but high rainfall unlikely: IMD||New Delhi: With easterly winds bringing in moisture, the monsoon started reviving over northwest India from Thursday but the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said that “there won’t be copious amount of rain”. The monsoon trough was along the Himalayan foothills during the first half of August that led to “break” monsoon conditions over the plains for over two weeks, according to the IMD.“The monsoon trough has started moving to its normal position. It was to the north which is why we had a dry spell. Easterly winds have started penetrating northwest India. Our models are showing an increase in rainfall over the Haryana, Chandigarh region. In August there was very less rainfall activity. The monsoon current has also weakened which is why for many days there was very less rain over the west coast also,” explained K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre at IMD. “But there will not be copious amount rain. Because monsoon flow is not very strong,” she added.The western end of monsoon trough is now near its normal position and the eastern end is south of its normal position. The eastern end of monsoon trough is very likely to shift gradually northward towards foothills of Himalayas during next two days, said the weather agency. A cyclonic circulation is lying over south Bihar and neighbourhood. It is likely to move nearly westwards during next three days, the IMD said. Due to above meteorological conditions, gradual increase in rainfall activity is likely over northwest India and Bihar. Widespread rainfall with isolated heavy rain is very likely over Bihar, east Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand from till August 23 and heavy to very heavy rain is also very likely over Uttarakhand on August 20. Fairly widespread rainfall is very likely over west Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh and east Rajasthan during August 20 to 23 with isolated heavy rainfall over these areas on August 20 and 21Enhanced rainfall activity over central and adjoining north Peninsular India can be expected during next two days. Fairly widespread to widespread rainfall activity with isolated heavy rain is very likely over Gujarat region, Konkan, Goa, Madhya Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh during August 20 to 21. Rainfall activity is very likely to decrease thereafter over above areas. Widespread and heavy rain is likely to increase over northeast India; sub–Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim on August 22.There is a 9% rain deficiency during the monsoon season since June 1 with 10% deficiency over northwest India; 11% deficiency over east and northeast India; 11% deficiency over central India and 5% excess over south peninsula. Punjab and Himachal Pradesh have a 22% rain deficiency; Chandigarh 39% deficiency; Uttarakhand 8% deficiency; Delhi and Haryana have recorded 6% and 13% excess respectively during the season. In other regions also many states have significant rainfall deficiency such as 29% in Odisha; 48% deficiency in Gujarat; 27% rain deficiency in Kerala.Monsoon begins withdrawal from northwest India around September 17 and withdraws completely by October 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-revival-begins-in-northwest-india-but-high-rainfall-unlikelyimd-101629403921762.html
20-08-2021||India||K’taka govt e-bike proposal calls it cheapest mode of transport||Bengaluru: E-bike taxis are expected to be the cheapest mode of transport in the city as per the draft recommendations sent by the state transport department to the government. According to the recommendations submitted last week, e-bikes are expected to charge ₹25 for the first 5 km and ₹50 for 10 km for electric bike taxis. After an opposition from the cab and autorickshaw drivers against the introduction of e-bikes, the department has proposed to decide to limit the operations of an e-bike within a radius of 10 km. In July, former chief minister BS Yediyurappa unveiled the Karnataka Electric Bike Taxi scheme-2021 with an aim to in a bid to generate employment, bring down pollution and reduce dependence on private vehicles in Bengaluru. The minimum fare for autorickshaws for the first 1.9 km is ₹25 and ₹13 is charged for every additional kilometre. This translates to around ₹61 for 5 km. In the case of cabs, the minimum fare is ₹75 for small cabs and ₹150 for luxury taxis for the first 4km. After that ₹18 (non-ac) and ₹24 (AC) are charged for additional kilometre. A senior transport department official said the department would allow only electric bike taxis to be operated in the city as of now. “We will allow any platform that invests in e-bikes, employs riders and provides taxi services to customers by charging fares fixed by the government. But no permission will be given to operate as an aggregator by attaching private bikes (whiteboard) and run them as bike taxis,” said the official. In past few years, the bike taxi services and the government have been at loggerhead over the use of motorcycles as taxies. Several companies have expressed their interest in getting the e-bike license but there are concerns about government regulations stalling such an initiative. Soon after the launch of bike taxis by cab-aggregators like Ola and Uber in 2016, the transport department cracked down on them, seizing vehicles since there were no provisions in existing laws for bike taxies. In fact, the bike taxies were not allowed to apply for a license either. In July, following a direction from the high court to allow bike taxi services to apply for the license, a ride-sharing company Rapido filed an application before the State Transport Authority (STA) seeking permission to run bike taxi services in the city. However, the transport department is yet to respond to their request. According to the transport department, even though registrations are open, they are yet to receive any requests for e-bike taxies. According to the department, any company with more than 100 electrics bikes can apply for a license from the state transport authority. This rule will be applicable for the aggregators as well. At the same time, any company, or individuals with less than 100 vehicles can apply for a license from the respective Regional Transport Offices, according to the department. According to the department, three companies have expressed interest to operate electronic bike taxis in the city, however, they are yet to apply for licence. “We appreciate the Karnataka government’s decision to let electric two-wheeler vehicles register as a commercial bike taxi. This is a long-awaited step in the right direction and will help people utilize their well-earned assets to earn a livelihood,” Aravind Sanka, co-founder, Rapido had said after the government announced the e-bike policy in July this year. However, criticising government’s rules as archaic and impractical, a senior executive of a bike taxi company, on the condition of anonymity, “There was an opportunity for a a person who couldn’t afford to own a car, to make a living using his motorcycle, but government demands, such as not allowing two-wheelers with whiteboards, are not conducive for it. We are excited about the e-bike policy but concerned about what outdated regulations we might have to face in the fine print of the e-bike policy,” said the official. However, the department has laid out conditions for issuing licenses, such as mandatory yellow number plates, Similarly, yellow helmets should be worn by bike riders and passengers. The rider should also wear a jacket with reflective colour, with the words ‘electric bike taxi’ written on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-govt-e-bike-proposal-calls-it-cheapest-mode-of-transport-101629403920444.html
20-08-2021||India||Mining case: Reddy gets SC nod to visit, stay in Bellary||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed former Karnataka minister Gali Janardhan Reddy to visit and stay in his native district Bellary in Karnataka, and Kadapa and Anantapur in Andhra Pradesh, where he was prohibited from visiting as per a 2015 order granting him bail in a mining case. Reddy, an accused in a multi-crore illegal mining case which is being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation since 2009, was granted bail by the top court on January 20, 2015 on the condition that he will not enter the three districts mentioned above. The former minister was granted conditional bail after spending more than three years in jail.Modifying the bail order, the bench of justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari said: “Keeping in view that the trial has not commenced for more than 12 years after registration of FIR in 2009 and petitioner (Reddy) has not violated conditions of bail even when he was permitted to visit Bellary, we direct the condition (c) contained in the order passed by this Court on January 20, 2015 be modified to the extent that the petitioner shall inform the Superintendent of Police of the districts concerned when he proposes to go and when he is to leave the district concerned.”The top court directed him to intimate about the modification of the order to the Senior Superintendent of Police of his native district..The bench also directed the central agency to intimate the court if any of the bail conditions, such as cooperation during trial and remaining present on dates fixed by courts among others,were violated by the former minister. It further ordered the trial in the case to be expedited and maintained strict vigil on the matter by listing the case after three months. “We observe that trial court may make every endeavour to expedite the trial,” it said.The court’s direction came after Reddy, in an affidavit filed through advocate Parmatma Singh, said that the CBI probe into the case is over. Referring to a memo filed by the central agency before the trial court on July 27 this year, Reddy said: “In the said memo, it is clearly averred on behalf of the CBI that the investigation in the FIR being RC17(A)/2009 dated December 7, 2009 is complete and there are no further reports to be filed u/s 173(8) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”In its counter-affidavit, the CBI said: “The witnesses (residing in Bellary) are very crucial for the prosecution case….The petitioner’s firms namely Obalapuram Mining Corporation Private Limited and Bellary Iron Ore Private Limited had criminally intimidated these witnesses and extorted the iron ore from these witnesses and their mining companies by forcing them to sell the iron ore at much lesser price than the prevailing market rates.” Appearing for the central agency, additional solicitor general Madhavi Divan said the trial in the case could possibly be hampered and safety of 47 witnesses staying in Bellary would be jeopardized if the accused was allowed to roam freely in the district.“This condition (to keep him out of Bellary) is the heart and soul of the January 20, 2015 order and if nothing has happened to the witnesses so far, it is because of this condition,” Divan said.The bench, however, observed that “in these kinds of matters, trial should not be kept hanging for years” and said “the trial court shall make every endeavour to expedite the trial”.Reddy’s counsels and senior advocates, Mukul Rohatgi and Ranjit Kumar, argued that every accused had the right to seek protection from the court. Rohatgi also referred to the slow pace of trial since 2015 and with 300 witnesses and at least 10,000 documents yet to be examined, such a bail condition could not be “cast in stone” against one of the accused. Kumar pointed out that the bail condition of staying away from hometown was not imposed on the remaining eight accused. Divan, however, explained that Reddy was the alleged kingpin of the mining scam and his bail was cancelled by Andhra Pradesh high court after he was found to have allegedly bribed the trial judge to secure bail. The trial in the bribery case is pending.Another judicial officer alleged that a huge bribe was offered to him for granting bail at the behest of the petitioner which he refused, the CBI counsel added. “If judges are not free, then witnesses are certainly not free. This is the biggest and the most notorious mining scams in the history of this country,” Divan said. Reddy and his brother-in-law B V Srinivas Reddy, managing director of the Obalapuram Mining Company (OMC), were arrested by CBI on September 5, 2011 from Ballari and brought to Hyderabad.The company is accused of changing mining lease boundary markings and indulging in illegal mining in the Ballari Reserve Forest area, spread over Ballari in Karnataka and Ananthpur district of Andhra Pradesh.The CBI had initially filed a charge sheet in the case in February, 2011, and thereafter, two supplementary ones, the latest one being on April 26, 2014. Reddy had also filed a discharge application in the special CBI court in Hyderabad, which is presently hearing the case, in October 2020 but withdrew the same later. While granting bail, the top court had directed him to surrender his passport before the concerned trial court and not to leave the country without the permission of the trial judge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mining-case-reddy-gets-sc-nod-to-visit-stay-in-bellary-101629403871162.html
20-08-2021||India||Italian marines case: SC tells Kerala HC not to issue compensation||The Supreme Court on Thursday directed the Kerala high court to not disburse the amount of ₹2 crore earmarked for the owner of the fishing vessel ‘St Antony’, which was attacked by two Italian marines aboard the Italian flagship Enrica Lexie in February 2012 after seven crew members demanded their share from his compensation. Two Indian fishermen were killed in the incident.On June 15 this year, the Supreme Court closed all proceedings in India against the Italian marines, Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, after being informed that compensation of ₹10 crore for the families of the victims has been deposited in the registry of the top court. The case was then transferred to the Kerala high court so that disbursement could be properly monitored.India accused the two marines on board the MV Enrica Lexie -- an Italian flagged oil tanker -- of killing the two Indian fishermen who were on a fishing vessel in India’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in February 2012. The owner of the fishing boat ‘St Antony’, in which two Kerala fishermen were killed when the marines opened fire on them allegedly under the misconception that they were pirates, filed the complaint against the Italians.In April, the Centre informed the Supreme Court that the families of the two deceased fishermen have been “adequately” compensated and sought expeditious closure of proceedings before the top court and a criminal trial pending before a special court in Delhi.The Centre’s compliance affidavit dated January 5 said the Italian government offered to pay a total of ₹10 crore in damages. The deceased fishermen’s families have agreed to compensation of ₹4 crore each in addition to the ₹2 crore already paid by the Italian government. The injured owner of the boat also consented to receive damages of ₹2 crore.The payout was part of an Arbitral Award of May 21, 2020, passed by the Arbitral Tribunal, set up under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS). This required India to close criminal proceedings against the two Italian marines while Italy was asked to continue with the proceedings.On Thursday, advocate Manish Dembla, appearing for the seven crew members who were onboard St Antony when the marines attacked it, submitted that no compensation has been directed to be paid to them, and sought a stay on the disbursement of ₹2 crore earmarked for the boat owner.“While directing the apportionment of compensation in the order (of June 15), the moral harm suffered by the captain and other crew members of St Antony has escaped the attention of the Supreme Court, perhaps, on account of the fact that crew members were not represented in the hearing,” said the application.The seven fishermen also wrote to the Kerala government to get their share out of the ₹2 crore payable to the boat owner. On June 24, Kerala’s Additional Chief Secretary said this was not possible as the order of the Supreme Court did not record their entitlement.Appearing for the Centre, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta suggested that the applicants be sent to the Kerala high court, which is considering the aspect of apportionment.Hearing the matter, a division bench comprising Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice V Ramasubramanian, said that if the compensation is being sought out of the compensation to be paid to boat owners of St Antony, they need to be made a party. The court also issued a notice to the boat owner to ascertain whether the seven fishermen were employed with St Antony.“The notice of this application be given to the boat owner and in the meanwhile, we request the Kerala High Court not to disburse any amount to the boat owner in terms of the June 15, 2021 order,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/italian-marines-case-sc-tells-kerala-hc-not-to-issue-compensation-101629403860364.html
20-08-2021||India||RSS-affiliated farmers’ group plans nationwide protest on Sept 8||The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, on Thursday emphasised that the government must ensure that farmers get remunerative prices for their produce to cover their production costs, which they are not getting in the existing system. With this demand, the BKS would hold a nationwide stir on September 8.At a press conference, the Sangh outfit said the Narendra Modi government should either bring new legislation or make changes in the farm laws enacted last year to add a provision for the payment of minimum support price (MSP) for major farm produce in the country.Explaining what it means by “remunerative price”, BKS national organising secretary Dinesh Kulkarni told mediapersons that it is the cost of production plus profit — something that the protesting farmers have been demanding as well. “Remunerative price is the right of farmers, which should be facilitated by the government,” said Kulkarni and pointed out that the MSPs announced by the government are not remunerative.Farmers mainly from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and joined by those from other states, under the banner of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, have been protesting at the borders of the national capital since November 26 against the three farm laws — Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. Several rounds of talks between the Centre and the farm unions have failed to end the deadlock.Kulkarni said a section of the farm leaders deviated from farmers’ interest for their personal agenda. “They should not close the door for dialogue with the government on MSP,” he said. Kulkarni said the nature of the agitation on the Delhi border changed after January 26, when the agitation turned violent. After that, dialogue with the Centre stopped, he said.The BKS leader also said that the three new farm laws do not have any clause about ensuring MSPs or remunerative prices for agricultural commodities, and the government should make guidelines in respect of contract farming where crops are not purchased below MSP. This should be at least implemented for the 23 crops that currently have MSP cover, he added.The BKS also expressed its reservation about changes in the Essential Commodities Act that offer huge exemptions to big companies by allowing them to stock some commodities as much as they want to promote business. This needs to be corrected, Kulkarni said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rssaffiliated-farmers-group-plans-nationwide-protest-on-sept-8-1629402545809.html
20-08-2021||India||Reputation in top court not built on whose child you are: SC judge||The Supreme Court on Thursday observed that the reputation in the top court is not built on whose son or daughter a lawyer is but on a counsel’s ability to evince his or her preparedness in arguing a case.A bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah was categorical that the judges in the apex court were not swayed by the pedigree of lawyers appearing before them.“Contrary to everyone’s opinion, reputation in this court does not build on whose son or daughter you are. It is built on how well-prepared you are. You gain respect of the judges by showing who you are and how ready you are as a counsel,” said justice Chandrachud.“Judges always remember about lawyers who are well-prepared. They respect such junior lawyers and give them greater opportunities in future. They always respect young lawyers who come to a court knowing the facts of their case,” added the judge.The court’s observations came while hearing a criminal case when a junior lawyer requested for an adjournment on the ground that her senior counsel was busy in another court.At this, the bench encouraged the young lawyer to start arguing the case.“You should at least start arguing the case. One should never become an adjournment counsel. That’s not how you want your career to be. How will you learn the craft of advocacy if you will never argue a case,” justice Shah asked advocate Ripul Swati Kumari.Justice Chandrachud, on his part, added: “We are not angry but we are trying to encourage you. Every time you appear before a judge, always be well-prepared to argue a case. Judges will have respect for you and that’s how your reputation will get built over the years. It has nothing to do with other factors.”Recounting an incident from decades ago when he was a junior lawyer practising in the Bombay high court, justice Chandrachud quipped how he once went to court to get an adjournment without carrying any file with him.“A senior lawyer called me and said – ‘Beta, never appear before a court without your files. It gives a very bad impression on a judge if you do it.’ I have not forgotten that till date. And you should also not forget this ever,” justice Chandrachud told Kumari.Justice Shah said when he was a judge in the Gujarat high court, he always made it a point to give ample opportunities to young lawyers to argue. “I was in fact accused by some of the senior counsel for favouring junior lawyers,” jested the judge.The bench then started hearing the matter, telling Kumari: “We will make you argue today. We will have the other side start the arguments with the bare facts and then we will ask you to argue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reputation-in-top-court-not-built-on-whose-child-you-are-sc-judge-1629401461996.html
20-08-2021||India||AIADMK delegation meets guv, accuses DMK of graft, vendetta||Chennai: Accusing the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) of indulging in “corruption, collection and vendetta”, a delegation of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) led by Edappadi Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam on Thursday called on Governor Banwarilal Purohit at the Raj Bhavan to complain against the ruling party, after boycotting the ongoing assembly session. The AIADMK submitted a five-page list of litanies to the governor, seeking an investigation and necessary action against the DMK. The AIADMK claimed that the agenda of the chief minister MK Stalin-led government is “corruption-collection-vendetta”. Interestingly, when in opposition, Stalin had described the AIADMK’s governance as “corruption-commission-collection”. The AIADMK has been edgy in what it perceives to be the beginning of troubled times after ruling the state for the past 10 years. On Wednesday, the 2017 heist-cum-murder case at late CM J Jayalalithaa’s Kodanad Estate came up in the assembly, a day after police quizzed the prime accused in the case, Sayan. The AIADMK staged a walkout from the assembly in protest. Soon after the DMK formed the government in May, in the first few weeks, the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) filed corruption cases against AIADMK leaders and raided Palaniswami’s close aide and former municipal administration minister SP Velumani and former transport minister MR Vijayabhaskar. A week ago, the AIADMK formed a six-member committee, comprising senior party leaders and legal brains including former law minister CV Shunmugham, to help party members fight cases. The same team met the governor on Thursday for about 40-minutes. After the meeting, former CM Palaniswami reiterated that out of “political vendetta”, the DMK was scheming to frame him and his colleagues in the Kodanad case and they were falsely foisting cases against former ministers. On Wednesday, Stalin dismissed the political vendetta charge, saying it was the DMK’s election promise to bring the real culprits involved in the 2017 Kodanad case to book. On Thursday, Palaniswami countered, “This has nothing to do with their poll promise. This is being overseen by law and is at the closing stage. Weren’t we conducting a fair investigation?” The principal opposition party said the DMK was doing this to cover up its failure in providing governance. “They have failed to deliver on all fronts and that’s their achievement in 100 days,” Palaniswami said. He added that the ruling party was influencing the official machinery to bring a quietus to the pending criminal cases against its own members and leaders. “They (AIADMK) aren’t able to face the consequences of their actions in the past 10 years so they are doing this,” said DMK spokesperson A Saravanan. Last year, the DMK had submitted a 100-page “chargesheet” against Palaniswami, Panneersevlam and other top ministers to the Governor. It went further in its election manifesto by vowing to establish a special court to try all the former ministers under graft charges. Meanwhile, the 2017 heist-murder case is haunting the AIADMK. The sprawling bungalow at Kodanad was what Jayalalithaa had bought along with her close aide V K Sasikala in the 1990s. In the early stages of the investigation, the police had alleged that Jayalalithaa’s former driver, C Kanagaraj, plotted the crime with Sayan. Subsequently, Kanagaraj, Sayan’s wife and their daughter died in separate road accidents. An independent investigation conducted by former managing editor of Tehelka, Mathew Samuel, alleged Palaniswami to be behind the break-in, a charge that the senior AIADMK leader has dismissed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-delegation-meets-guv-accuses-dmk-of-graft-vendetta-1629401281290.html
20-08-2021||India||Goa minister doesn’t want BJP to induct more leaders, says there is no space||PANAJI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) cannot accommodate any more leaders from other parties in Goa, state panchayat and transport minister Mauvin Godinho said on Thursday.Godinho, a former Congressman who joined the BJP ahead of the 2017 assembly elections, said the party doesn’t have any more place to ‘accommodate’ leaders from other parties who wish to join the BJP.“We do not want more, it creates confusion... we don’t have place. Where will you accommodate them? This is our situation,” Mauvin Godinho told reporters while speaking about the BJP’s prospects in the upcoming state polls early next year.The ruling BJP has a strength of 27 MLAs in the 40-member house after it convinced 13 Congress MLAs as well as two MLAs from the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party to switch sides with the most recent being the ‘en masse’ switch over by 10 Congress MLAs in 2019. The Congress, which won 17 seats in the last elections, is down to 5.The BJP has said it is confident of retaining a majority on its own with or without an alliance.But the induction of leaders from rival parties has created its own set of problems, particularly since it had to reward the lawmakers who joined the party after the elections at the cost of the party stalwarts.Several of these leaders, most prominently former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar, have already staked their ‘rightful’ claim to the party’s ticket though the seat he once represented now being represented by his rival who won on the Congress ticket but is now in the BJP.Rivalries between MLAs too has come to the fore with Godinho himself squaring up against his party colleagues Michael Lobo and Alina Saldanha over each other’s ‘performance’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-minister-doesn-t-want-bjp-to-induct-more-leaders-says-there-is-no-space-1629400498770.html
20-08-2021||India||Guj HC stays key sections of new anti-conversion law||The Gujarat high court on Thursday stayed the operation of key sections of the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act, 2021, citing its sweeping premise that suggested that all interfaith marriages were illegal.The court said the law cannot be enforced until there is clear evidence of “force, allurement or fraudulent” for religious conversion and that it appeared to be against inter-religion marriages at the very inception.The order by a division bench comprising Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Biren Vaishnav comes two days after the court observed that the law was a “sword hanging” over interfaith couples since the Act did not convey anywhere that such marriages were permissible.Issuing the interim order on Thursday, the bench said the purpose of this directive was to protect people “from unnecessary harassment.”The court stated, “We are of the opinion that pending further hearing, rigors of section 3, 4, 4a to 4c, 5, 6, and 6a shall not operate merely because the marriage is solemnised by a person of one religion with another religion without force, allurement or fraudulent means and such marriages cannot be termed as marriage for the purpose of unlawful conversion.”These sections define forcible conversion for marriage and provide for penal action for violating the law. The stay prevents anyone from lodging an FIR under this law merely on the basis of an interfaith marriage -- the court’s order suggested that this was in the realm of the possible.Responding to the court order, Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel told reporters: “Whenever such rulings are passed, our legal department and other technical sections look into it. Once we receive this interim order and after our legal experts have studied it, the government will decide on the future course of action.”Mujaheed Nafis of Gujarat Minority Coordination Committee, who was also a petitioner besides the Gujarat chapter of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, said, “We argued that this law itself is totally against the Constitution of India, that guarantees the citizens the liberty to choose their religion.”The Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act, 2021, which penalises forcible or fraudulent religious conversion through marriage, was notified by the Gujarat Government on June 15. The amendment to the 2002 law was passed in the State Assembly earlier this year and Governor Acharya Devvrat gave his assent on May 22.The law is one of several passed by states where the Bharatiya Janata Party is in power, and targets what members of the party and its affiliates refer to as love jihad , where Muslim men misrepresent their religion to woo and marry women from other communities, mostly Hindus.When state Advocate General, Kamal Trivedi, sought a clarification asking what if a marriage resulted in forceful conversion, the Chief Justice said, “There has to be a basic element of force or allurement or fraud. Without that you will not (proceed), that’s all we have said in the order.”Among the sections the operation of which has been stayed by the court is Section 3 which defines “forcible conversion”.It states: “No person shall convert or attempt to convert any person from one religion to another by use of force, or by allurement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage or by getting a person married or by aiding a person to get married, nor shall any person abet such conversion”.Under Section 4, people found guilty of violating the provisions of Section 3 will face up to three years of imprisonment and a fine of ₹50,000. If the victim is a minor, a woman or from SC or ST community, then the jail term will be four years with a fine of ₹1 lakh.The other stayed clause, Section 4A, deals with “marriage by unlawful conversion”. This section states: “Conversion by marriage or by getting a person married or by aiding a person to get married is concerned, shall be punished with imprisonment not less than three years, but may extend up to five years along with a fine of ₹2 lakh”.Section 4B states any marriage for the purpose of unlawful conversion “shall be declared void by family court”. And Section 4C includes institutions or organisations found involved in unlawful conversions.Section 5, which has also been stayed, mandates religious priests to seek permission from a district magistrate for conversion. And people being converted also needsto “send an intimation” to the DM in a prescribed form.Section 6 mandates prior sanction of the DM or a sub-divisional magistrate to start prosecution against the accused and Section 6A says the burden of proof is on the accused “who has caused the conversion”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/guj-hc-stays-key-sections-of-new-anti-conversion-law-101629396374574.html
20-08-2021||India||NIA begins probe into tiffin bomb dropped by drone||New Delhi: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has launched an investigation into the delivery of a sophisticated tiffin bomb along with hand grenades and 100 pistol cartridges using a drone by Pakistan backed Khalistani terrorists earlier this month, people familiar with the development said. The consignment was dropped on August 9 near a drain at Daleke village in Lopoke sub-division of Amritsar district, Punjab, just ahead of the Independence Day, following which the state was put on high alert. This is NIA’s fourth drone related probe in past year and half. The tiffin bomb , thus named because 2-3 kg of RDX was packed in a children’s lunch box, was sophisticated enough for Punjab director general of police Dinkar Gupta to say at the time of its recovery that it seemed to be straight off an “assembly line”. There may be more of such tiffin boxes, which would be coming, or might have come and we don’t know yet”. The lunch box, five hand grenades and ammunition for a 9mm pistol were packed in a bag and dropped off by a drone. Officials in security agencies investigating drone activity from across the border said that all anti-India groups, be it Islamic terrorists such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, or Hizbul Mujahideen, Khalistani terrorists, and drug smugglers are increasingly using drones to deliver arms, explosives, and drugs to avoid capture. NIA recently took over investigation into the dual bombing of the Jammu air force station on June 27 by LeT using drones, which travelled almost 14 km from across the border. The investigators examined several villagers on the possible route taken by the two drones used in the attack but there has been no breakthrough in the case as of now. Apart from the federal anti-terror agency, Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir police are also investigating multiple drone related incidents, which have posed a challenge for the security and intelligence agencies. The Khalistani network, particularly Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF) and Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF), are extensively using Chinese drones with the help of Pakistan’s spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), with a purpose to arm a movement to destabilize Punjab. Multiple assessments by Indian security agencies and the Border Security Force (BSF) have highlighted that the use of commercial drones (or quadcopters) by the Pakistan army, ISI and terror groups is a serious threat considering the size of the border, which is difficult to man physically round the clock. Union home minister Amit Shah said recently that the government will soon have an anti-drone technology in place to combat the threat. “Smuggling of drugs, arms and explosives through tunnels and drones is a major challenge. Today, it is very important for us to deal with these challenges at the earliest. I am confident that we will soon increase our presence at the borders with Swadeshi (made-in-India) anti-drone technology,” Shah said on July 17. Bureau of Police Research and Development, as reported by HT last month, has already formulated detailed specifications and guidelines for anti-drone technologies and submitted the same to the ministry of home affairs (MHA). Among the issues covered by the BPRD are threats posed by unregulated/rogue drones to attack critical structures such as oil and gas installations, military bases, and airports apart from targeted assassinations; the importance of declaring particular areas as no-drone zones; training police/security personnel in handling anti-drone systems; and collaborating with private sector for harnessing the technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/niabegins-probe-into-tiffin-bomb-dropped-by-drone-101629395817300.html
20-08-2021||India||Jesuit body moves Bombay HC to clear Stan Swamy’s name||The Jamshedpur Jesuit Province, to which late tribal rights activist and Elgar Parishad accused Father Stan Swamy was attached to, has sought the removal of the odium (widespread hatred) linked to the priest’s name.In the written submissions filed before the Bombay high court (HC), Swamy’s lawyers have submitted that as per the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and Supreme Court (SC) rulings, even though the priest died on July 5 pending his medical bail hearing in HC, the next of kin of the late activist has a right to seek the removal of the odium.The submissions by senior advocates Mihir Desai and Mihir Joshi, filed in the bail application of Swamy, stated that the Jamshedpur Jesuit Providence appointed Fr Frazer Mascarenhas as the late activist’s next of kin and he would participate in the inquiry by the magistrate.They have sought that the inquiry is conducted as per the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) guidelines pertaining to custodial deaths and also the Nelson Mandela Rules framed by the United Nations, which deal with the provision of facilities to inmates of prisons.While hearing Swamy’s bail application, the HC bench of Justice SS Shinde was informed of the untimely demise of Swamy, who was being treated at Holy Family Hospital in Bandra after being shifted from Taloja Central Prison, as per an order of the court. At the request of Swamy’s lawyer, who contended that there was negligence on the part of the prison authorities as well as the National Investigation Agency (NIA) which resulted in Swamy’s health deteriorating and his death, HC had ordered a magistrate inquiry.NIA opposed the inquiry, stating that as Section 394 of CrPC – which deals with abatement of criminal proceedings, convictions and sentences against accused/convict – was applicable in this case there was no need for the report to be submitted before HC. However, Desai requested that as it was a case of custodial death, the court should exercise parens patriae (parent of the nation) jurisdiction and ask for reports of the judicial inquiry. HC accepted the contention.While seeking the removal of stigma attached to Swamy’s name, the submissions said that Article 21 (Right to life and personal liberty) of the Constitution applied to deceased persons too. “Just as the appellant [Swamy] would have had a right to clear his name if he were alive, similarly those closest to him would have a similar right to clear his name,” the lawyers contended.They further stated that though the application of section 394 was not acceptable, assuming that it was applied even though Swamy was not convicted or sentenced, as per an SC ruling, the next of kin had a right to seek removal of the odium at the time of hearing of the bail application. The lawyers submitted that as the special court had made adverse observations while rejecting Fr Swamy’s bail application, the observations would remain a stigma on his name and hence, there was a prayer for the removal of the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jamshedpur-jesuit-body-moves-bombay-hc-to-clear-stan-swamy-s-name-101629395761639.html
20-08-2021||India||Sonia to chair 18 oppn parties’ meet today, AAP not invited||At least 18 opposition parties were scheduled to meet virtually on Friday to strategise on reaching out to the people on issues such as the economic slowdown, the alleged mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Pegasus spyware controversy, and the farmers’ protest,But the meeting, to be chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, will not have Delhi’s ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) even as it was a crucial part of the opposition’s united floor management in the recent monsoon session of Parliament.“We have not invited AAP as the meeting is chaired by the Congress president,” said a top leader who would be present in the virtual meeting. “Both the AAP and the Congress are uncomfortable sharing the same political platform,” he said on condition of anonymity.Former National Democratic Alliance (NDA) member Shiromani Akali Dal has also not been invited, party functionaries confirmed. The Akalis quit the NDA last year over the three controversial farm laws, but instead of aligning with the mainstream opposition parties, they have kept their focus on the farm laws and are treading a separate path. With elections in Punjab due in six months, the Congress and its rival Akalis would not be interested in sharing a common platform against the NDA.Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party has been invited but the UP-based party has not confirmed its participation.The meeting takes off from a new-found unity among the opposition parties during the Parliament session when several anti-NDA parties joined hands on every single issue and nearly washed out the monsoon session.“This Parliament session was one of the worst in history. Almost none of the people’s issues were discussed in it. Now, we are meeting to decide how to take these issues to the people. We will discuss the Covid mismanagement, economic situation, Pegasus, farmers protests and the struggle of the workers in the wake of privatisation,” said Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, a key figure in achieving this opposition unity.Apart from Gandhi and Yechury, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren, former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and National Conference chairman Farooq Abdullah, former Prime Minister HD Devegowda and other leaders would attend the meeting.The date of the meeting also coincides with late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s birth anniversary, but the organisers claim the anniversary has nothing to do with it and the date was chosen as all leaders could make themselves available.The biggest challenge for the opposition, however, is how to reach out to the people in this prevailing Covid pandemic. “That’s also a key topic of discussion. But whatever we do, we will comply with the Covid protocol,” Yechury said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-to-chair-18-oppn-parties-meet-today-aap-not-invited-101629395516914.html
20-08-2021||India||SC to cops: Don’t arrest merely because you can||Don’t arrest people just because you can, or just because you have to file the charge sheet, the Supreme Court has told the police.Arrests can cause incalculable harm to the reputation and self-esteem of a person,  the Supreme Court said,  as it implored the police officers not to make the arrest a routine affair just because the law arms them with the power to do so. “Personal liberty is an important aspect of our constitutional mandate,” emphasised a bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy while disapproving of the practice of arresting people in criminal cases even when investigations can be completed without sending the accused to jail. “The occasion to arrest an accused during investigation arises when the custodial investigation becomes necessary or it is a heinous crime or where there is a possibility of influencing the witnesses or the accused may abscond. Merely because an arrest can be made because it is lawful does not mandate that arrest must be made,” noted the bench. The court was emphatic that a distinction must be made between the existence of the power to arrest and the justification for the exercise of this power. “If an arrest is made routine, it can cause incalculable harm to the reputation and self-esteem of a person. If the Investigating Officer has no reason to believe that the accused will abscond or disobey summons and has, in fact, throughout cooperated with the investigation we fail to appreciate why there should be a compulsion on the officer to arrest the accused,” underlined the bench. The court’s observations came while hearing a pre-arrest bail petition of a man, named an accused along with 83 others in a case of cheating and forgery which was registered in Uttar Pradesh in 2014. While he was not arrested during the last seven years when he joined the investigation, the police moved to arrest him since the charge sheet was to be filed before the court. The Allahabad high court refused to grant him protection from arrest by an order on July 9, forcing the accused to approach the apex court. The counsel for the UP government submitted in the top court that the arrest memo was issued since the trial court wanted the accused to be in custody before the charge sheet could be taken on record under Section 170 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). Section 170 talks of cases where there is sufficient evidence to prosecute the accused and states that police officers shall forward the accused “under custody” to a competent court for trial at the time of filing of the charge sheet. Rejecting the trial court’s views, the bench said that such a course is  “misplaced and contrary to the very intent” of the law since Section 170 of the CrPC does not impose an obligation on the officer-in-charge to arrest each and every accused at the time of filing of the charge sheet. “We are of the view that if the Investigating Officer does not believe that the accused will abscond or disobey summons he/she is not required to be produced in custody. The word ‘custody’ appearing in Section 170 of the CrPC does not contemplate either police or judicial custody but it merely connotes the presentation of the accused by the Investigating Officer before the court while filing the charge sheet,” held the bench. “It (the law) does not impose an obligation on the Officer-in-charge to arrest each and every accused at the time of filing of the charge sheet,” it added. It pointed out that the legal position has to be made clear since the Supreme Court has been regularly coming across cases where the accused has cooperated with the investigation throughout and yet on the charge sheet being filed, non-bailable warrants have been issued on the ground that there is an obligation to arrest the accused and produce him before the court. In the present case, the court set aside the high court order and protected the accused from arrest on the condition that he will keep cooperating with the investigators and will appear before the trial court at the time of filing of the charge sheet. “When the appellant has joined the investigation, the investigation has been completed,  and he has been roped in after seven years of registration of the FIR, we can think of no reason why at this stage he must be arrested before the charge sheet is taken on record,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-cops-don-t-arrest-merely-because-you-can-101629395486403.html
20-08-2021||India||NHRC issues summons to Chhattisgarh police chief over activist’s arrest||The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has summoned Chhattisgarh Police chief D M Awasthi on October 21 with sought action taken reports on the arrest of activist Hidme Markam in Dantewada under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) in March this year.The summons in this regard was issued on August 16 based on a complaint by the People Union For Civil Liberties (PUCL) and other activists. “The Commission observes that despite direction and reminders, the said authority has failed to submit the requisite report till date. Taking serious view of the same, the commission directs to issue summons to the DGP (director general of police Awasthi) under section 13 of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, to appear before the commission...” the NHRC order read. The human rights panel, however, said that Awasthi’s appearance will not be required if the concerned reports are submitted before October 14. Awasthi said he is looking into the matter and that a report will be submitted on time.In their complaint, the PUCL alleged that Markam, 28, was picked up on March 9 over an event to mark International Women’s Day. “Later the victim was shown as arrested in four cases involving serious charges, including charges under UAPA without following due process/guidelines of arrest laid down by the apex court ...,” the complaint read. Dantewada Police superintendent Abhishek Pallava claimed all due process for arrest as per the law was followed. “She was accused of four serious offences, including a case under UAPA. She has been arrested and is in judicial custody,” he said. Taking cognisance of the complaint on March 31, the NHRC had directed Awasthi to submit an action taken report within four weeks. Awasthi, however, failed to submit the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhrcissues-summons-to-chhattisgarh-police-chief-over-activist-s-arrest-101629366826088.html
20-08-2021||India||India completes 500 million Covid-19 tests||India on Wednesday completed 500 million tests to detect Coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The first Covid-19 test was conducted on January 24, 2020.“With an average daily testing of at least 1.7 million in the month of August, India has tested 500 million samples across the country till date,” said ICMR in a statement.The last 100 million tests were performed in only 55 days. On July 21, 2021, India tested 450 million Covid-19 samples.The government attributes it to rapidly increasing testing infrastructure and capacity across the country.According to ICMR, which is responsible for overseeing Covid-19 testing, it has been enhancing the testing capability across the country by leveraging technology and facilitating innovation in affordable diagnostic kits.Also Read | No evidence of lasting lung damage in Covid-19 survivors: StudyThe testing strategy has been carefully calibrated to increase access and availability of testing over the months. “We have seen that exponential increase in testing led to early identification, prompt isolation and effective treatment of Covid-19 cases. This testing milestone is testimony to the fact that India has been successful in implementing strategy of 5T approach --Test, Track, Trace, Treat and use of Technology -- efficiently, which will enable us to contain the spread of the pandemic,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, ICMR.Close to 3,000 labs (2,876) are approved to perform Covid-19 tests in the country, and even now, mass testing is on in areas showing a high positivity rate. Positivity rate is the percentage of people testing positive for the virus of the total tests conducted.Of the 2,876 approved labs, 1,322 are dedicated government laboratories.Several advancements have been made towards reducing turnaround time of tests. Easy, at-home self-diagnostic kits have been developed and approved to make it easy for people to perform the test at home.“Enhanced production of diagnostic kits has made India Atma Nirbhar, which has resulted in reduction of costs and improved availability of testing kits,” Dr Bhargava added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-completes-500-million-covid-19-tests-101629350143932.html
20-08-2021||Today's||The inside story of the retrospective tax blunder||In August 2012, when I took charge as secretary, department of economic affairs, the Indian economy was under great stress. Apart from all the other causes — such as the galloping crude oil prices, huge fiscal deficit, 2G/coal and other alleged “scams”— the imposition of the retrospective tax on deals involving the transfer of Indian assets through an off-shore transaction by a foreign entity, which had assets in India, had a deleterious impact.It was introduced through an amendment to the finance act of 2012. This amendment resulted in three major legal cases against the Government of India by Vodafone International Holdings BV, Cairn Energy Plc and Cairn UK Holdings Limited and Vedanta Resources. This not only resulted in a setback to India’s image as a country that had well-established and predictable legal framework, but also vitiated the investment climate.Policymakers often ignore the fact that, in the assessment of investors, a stable and predictable legal policy framework is one of the key determinants of competitive advantage a country enjoys vis-à-vis others. While all countries have resorted to retrospective legislation to correct certain anomalies that may creep in during the implementation of a law, these amendments are largely to remove ambiguities and improve the business environment.In India’s case, there were two weaknesses. One, the law was amended retrospectively, from 1962, which meant that every such transaction that may have occurred over the previous 40-plus years could technically be reopened and fresh taxes imposed. This created huge uncertainty for businesses. Two, the amendment was introduced to nullify the order of the Supreme Court of India, the highest judicial body in the country, thereby signalling that the investors could not presume finality in the legal process. In one stroke, India’s reputation as a well-run economy with a strong rule of law was damaged.In some of my earliest meetings with the then finance minister, P Chidambaram, I had brought up the issue of retrospective taxation and how it would make our task of attracting private investors, especially foreign investors, difficult. This was crippling at a time when the need for fiscal correction had drastically reduced the capacity of the government to spend and substantive private investment was needed, even in public infrastructure, to revive the economy and to create jobs.Chidambaram was visibly unhappy with the amendment and minced no words in saying that this act of the finance ministry was fatal for the economy. I suspect the move of RS Gujral, who was then the revenue secretary and spearheaded this amendment, to the department of expenditure, was a show of displeasure. But, when Raghuram Rajan, who, by then, had joined as the chief economic adviser, and I strongly recommended the scrapping the amendment, Chidambaram demurred. By then, there were too many so-called “scams” up in the air and rolling back the amendment would seem a deal had been made with Vodafone.In May 2014, when Arun Jaitley became the finance minister, we started discussing the design of the full budget for 2014-15 that was to be presented in July that year. I brought up the matter of retrospective taxation with him. Before the elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies had termed retrospective taxation as “tax terrorism”. I recommended that scrapping of the amendment could be included in the Finance Bill. This would reflect the views of his party and would also send out a strong message that the new government was in favour of attracting private investment and creating a stable and predictable tax regime. Jaitley concurred without reservations, but suggested this matter be discussed in a meeting with the prime minister (PM).In that meeting, there was a lengthy discussion in which I put forward the reasons for amending the “amendment”. Jaitley strongly supported the arguments. PM Narendra Modi also said he felt that the retrospective tax law had damaged the country’s image. But several senior bureaucrats from the PM’s Office opposed the finance ministry’s proposal vehemently. They put forward the argument that any change would appear that a deal had been made with Vodafone.Jaitley then suggested that perhaps we could include this issue in the budget of 2015-16. I reminded him that no such allegation could stick on a government in power for only 45 days but if we missed this opportunity, there may not be another in the foreseeable future. I, of course, lost the argument and retrospective taxation remained.Arvind Panagariya, in a scathing critique, wrote that the budget had been hijacked by the “babus” in the finance ministry and the political masters were not allowed to change the status quo. We, in the finance ministry, couldn’t defend ourselves as the responsibility for all government decisions is collective.It has taken the government nine years to withdraw the retrospective taxation amendments, and, that too, perhaps because of the possibility of adverse rulings in international arbitration cases. This is a much delayed, but welcome move. This should also be a reminder to the government that the recent piecemeal and knee-jerk legal and regulatory responses to developments in emerging business areas such as e-commerce and big-tech will end up becoming as counterproductive as the retrospective taxation move, and, therefore, there should be a pause and a rethink.As we have seen, any legal change, without careful and rigorous thinking about its implications, can cause huge damage, and it can take years to rectify.Arvind Mayaram is a former finance secretary, Government of IndiaThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-inside-story-of-the-retrospective-tax-blunder-101629470945045.html
20-08-2021||Today's||When women pay the price for State failure||What’s not to love about a chota parivaar, that quintessential Indian family of parents and their two children? Fewer children mean better maternal health, more judicious use of family resources, improved nutrition, higher education outcomes, and a healthier planet, already groaning under the weight of 7.9 billion humans.And, yet, when the State plans laws to punish parents who cross the two-child limit, let’s be clear about who pays the highest price. It’s women, the poorest and most marginalised.As Uttar Pradesh (UP) fine-tunes its draft population bill listing out disincentives for those who have more than two children — and thank you for the clarification that having two daughters is not a “deficiency” that grants wiggle room for a son — as many as 12 states already have policies that impose a slew of restrictions, from participating in panchayat elections to disqualification from government schemes.Also Read | A pathbreaking ruling on equalityLook at just one of these states: When Haryana placed restrictions on candidates for the 2015 panchayat elections, 68% of Dalit women and 50% of all women were instantly disenfranchised, according to advocate Indira Jaising who challenged the move in the Supreme Court. Any move to cut women out of public life, where their participation is already circumscribed, must be resisted.Women in India lack the agency to decide the most intimate aspects of their lives: Who they marry, when they get married, when they have children, and how many children they have. Yet, even with this limited agency, more are opting to use contraception. The latest round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) shows the highest use of contraception is among Muslim women (49%), compared to just 42.8% for Hindu women.But NFHS also tells us of “unmet” needs in contraception — women who want to delay pregnancy (or not have one at all), but lack access to contraceptives. Nearly 13% of married women have this unmet need. And at 18%, UP has the second-highest unmet need for family planning, after Bihar at 21%.The failure to provide family planning to women lies with the State. It cannot now seek to impose penalties on those who have more children than they planned because they could not access contraception. Women cannot pay the price for State failure.But perhaps concerns over India’s burgeoning population — we will overtake China by 2027, says the United Nations — are misplaced. India’s growth trajectory is already slowing with decadal growth down from 21.5% in 1991-2001 to 17.7% during 2001-2011, according to the Census. Given our young demographic, the graph will keep climbing before it stabilises around 2050, says Poonam Muttreja of the Population Foundation of India.Coercive policies haven’t worked in countries such as China, which saw a surge in sex-selective abortions. We have a lesson from India too. In 1977, following forced sterilisation in what was Sanjay Gandhi’s pet project during the Emergency, Indira Gandhi found herself voted out of power.Namita Bhandare writes on gender The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/when-women-pay-the-price-for-state-failure-101629463864455.html
20-08-2021||Editorials||Investigate political violence||West Bengal has a history of political violence. This has taken explicit forms; the ultra-left rebellion that started from Naxalbari in the late 1960s sparked a period of brutal killings and a forceful state crackdown. But violence has also been insidious. The three-and-a-half decade long political domination of the Left was accompanied by a high level of coercion to enforce the party’s writ on society. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) imported much of the Left’s coercive machinery — the most visible manifestation of its willingness to deploy threats and violence as a political tactic was during the 2018 panchayat elections. In arguably the most competitive assembly election Bengal has seen in its recent history, this year, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged that the TMC had not just killed its workers before polls, but had deployed force to punish its supporters after the polls, resulting in killings as well as crimes against women. The TMC has denied the allegations and claimed that, in any case, the Election Commission was in charge of law enforcement during the poll process.Also Read | CBI, SIT to probe Bengal post-election violence: High courtIt is in this backdrop that the Calcutta high court, on Thursday, ordered a court-monitored independent probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into cases of murder, rape and attempted rape against women during the poll process. It also set up a special investigation team under the supervision of a retired Supreme Court judge to probe other related cases. This was based on a National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) report — the TMC has alleged the report was a product of a political agenda, questioning the impartiality of the commission’s members; two judges too critiqued NHRC for overstepping its jurisdiction. The BJP has welcomed the order, while the TMC has indicated it will move the Supreme Court against the order.There are two inter-related issues here. One, political violence is unacceptable. And if it was deployed before, during or after the electoral process, it undermines the fundamental right of citizens to make political choices freely. And therefore, an investigation is essential. The TMC must cooperate fully and act against any leader or worker who may have been involved. Two, the credibility of any such investigation rests on whether it is professional and independent, or based on political diktats and interests. And therefore, the BJP must not compromise the enquiry by using its political influence to shape conclusions in the case of CBI. Uncovering the truth is essential to cleaning up democracy and providing justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/investigate-political-violence-101629463504738.html
