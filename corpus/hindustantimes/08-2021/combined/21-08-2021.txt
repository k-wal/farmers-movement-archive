The soldier, however, is alive.The Incident took place in Gadag district during the minister’s ‘Jan Ashirvad Yatra’. According to BJP leaders, Narayanaswamy was taken to the house of Ravikumar Kattimani, who is currently posted in Jammu and Kashmir region, instead of taking him to the house of Basavaraj Hiremath, who died in Pune a year ago. As part of the minister’s itinerary, he was scheduled to visit the dead soldier’s family and offer condolences to them. The minister visited the residence of a living soldier, instead of the one who was killed in action, after apparently being misled by local leaders. The minister announcing a government job and land to kin took the family by surprise. Soon after the minister’s announcement, the soldier’s parents started sobbing uncontrollably as they presumed that he had been killed and the minister had come to inform them about this death. “But a local leader soon realised there was something wrong. Since he had the soldier’s number with him, he quickly made a video call and the minister understood the mistake when the video call started. He tried to praise the son in an attempt to control the situation. The BJP leader who had given them false information was taken pulled up later,” said a local BJP leader. In his attempt to control the situation the minister also felicitated the family members before leaving their home. “My husband is working in Kashmir, it has been two months since we got married. The minister coming to our house and inquiring about us caused some confusion, but neighbors’ said he might be coming out of respect to soldiers serving in border areas....when he started assuring job and land, I felt somewhat and told him that- my husband is there and I will have to ask him”, Kattimani’s wife told local media. Noting that someone has given wrong information to the minister, she said the family was relieved only after speaking to her husband. “....it caused unnecessary tension to us and my husband there.” The minister however did not visit the dead soldier Hiremath’s family. “No one came to our house. He (minister) is said to have gone to the house of a soldier who is alive....I only want my son back,” an emotional Hiremath’s mother said.

21-08-2021||Bangalore||‘Waited 2 days for flight’: Afghan returnees on journey back home||Melvin, a resident of Ullal in Karnataka, was stranded at the Kabul airport for two days without food after the Taliban took over the Afghanistan capital. He was working as an electrician at a hospital in Kabul and returned home on Wednesday. “I have been working in Afghanistan for the past 10 years as an electrician in a hospital. Since I was working at a military hospital, my accommodation was near the airport. So, when the message came that the Indian Air Force is operating flights, I was able to get there on time. We had to wait for two days before we could get on the flight,” Melvin recollected. While he was able to get a direct flight to India operated by the IAF, other Indians who boarded different flights were taken to London, Dubai, and Norway, said Melvin. His brother landed in Qatar and is currently under quarantine. “The flight first took us to Jamnagar base in Gujarat and from there I went to New Delhi and reached my hometown,” he said. Though the Taliban had entered Kabul, Melvin said his workplace was secure since it was a military hospital. “I didn’t feel any problems, apart from the anxiety about being able to return home,” he said. While Melvin was able to make it home, families of two Christian missionaries are awaiting their return, said the Dakshin Kannada district authorities. Officials said information about Father Jerome Sequera from Mangaluru and Father Robert Rodriguez from Teerthahalli have been passed on to the nodal officer appointed for coordinating the rescue of Kannadigas stuck in Afghanistan. The Karnataka government on Wednesday appointed a senior IPS official as the nodal officer to coordinate with the Centre to bring back residents of the state from Afghanistan.“As there is a conflict situation in Afghanistan, to bring back Indians stranded there, the central government has already started a helpline. To coordinate with the central government and bring back Kannadigas safely from there, Umesh Kumar, IPS, additional director general of police, CID, Bengaluru, has been appointed as a nodal officer,” an official notification said on Wednesday.According to the information currently available, both the missionaries were trying to reach the Kabul International Airport. However, the situation is chaotic at the airport since the Taliban took control, said the officials based on the families’ interaction with the duo. 35-year-old Deepak Kumar, another man from Karnataka who recently returned from Afghanistan, said they were able to evacuate before the rush began at the airport. Kumar was part of the rescue firefighting crew team of the US and NATO army base in Herat. The resident of Puttur in Dakshina Kannada has been working at the base for the past six years. Unlike Melvin who returned to India after Kabul fell, Kumar returned to India on June 22, since the battle for Herat city had begun much earlier. “We worked with Portuguese and British nationals. Some have joined from Maharashtra and Kerala also. When I worked at a military base, rockets launched by the Taliban used to fall right inside the premises,” Kumar said, adding he wanted to continue working, but the situation was not conducive. “I am in touch with locals of Herat city who worked with me. There is a curfew kind of atmosphere in the entire city. People are not coming out of their houses,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/waited-2-days-for-flight-afghan-returnees-on-journey-back-home-101629570431378.html
21-08-2021||Delhi||Record single-day August rain for Delhi, highest in 14 years||New Delhi: After a 10-day long, hot, dry spell, the national capital on Saturday received 138.8mm rain in 24 hours, the highest single-day rainfall recorded in August in 14 years and the ninth highest since 1961 during the month, showed the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) rainfall records.The heavy showers and thunder activity that hit the city early Saturday morning submerged key stretches and major underpasses, including Minto Bridge in central Delhi, throwing traffic out of gear.According to IMD officials, between 8.30am on Friday and 8.30am on Saturday, the Safdarjung observatory received 138.8 mm rainfall. The city received a bulk of its rainfall during the spell — the heaviest so far this season — between 2.30 am on Friday and 8.30 am on Saturday, when it rained continuously for six hours.IMD records show that previously Delhi received such a heavy 24-hour spell during the month on August 2, 2007, when the city got 166.6mm rainfall. The highest-ever single-day rainfall recorded during this month was on August 2, 1961 (184mm).“Today’s record is also the ninth highest single-day rainfall since 1961. It is mainly because of a cloud belt passing through the northern and central parts of Delhi. The thunder activity and lightning was primarily on its account. Light rain activity is expected to stay till August 23,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, IMD.The wet spell, however, is likely to be over soon, said weather officials, and the last week of August is likely to be mostly dry.While this August has mostly been dry, with a 10-day break phase, Saturday’s spell has nearly covered the rain deficit for the month. With Saturday’s rain, the total rainfall received this month is 202mm. The normal rainfall count for the month is 247.7mm.August is usually Delhi’s wettest month.Delhi saw a long dry spell with above normal temperatures between August 9 and August 19 because of monsoon’s break phase in northwest India. Before this, Delhi received 15.4mm of showers on August 8.“The monsoon trough was close to Delhi and with a cloud belt passing through its northern and central parts, heavy rainfall occurred in Delhi. This is going to lead to a significant drop in temperatures. Light to moderate showers are expected on Sunday as well. Patchy rainfall will continue till August 23. However, from August 24, the weather again is likely to go dry for at least four or five days, as the trough is again expected to shift away from northwest India,” said a senior IMD official.On Saturday, the maximum temperature was 32.6 degrees Celsius, a notch below the season’s average. The minimum settled at 23.8°C, three notches below normal for this time of the year.Mahesh Palawat, president, skymet, a private forecaster said that a cyclonic circulation built over east Rajasthan and the trough was also in Delhi’s vicinity, which resulted in Saturday’s heavy spell. “However, weather is again likely to go dry from August 25 to August 30, because of the trough likely to shift to the Himalayan foothills once again,” said Palawat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/record-single-day-august-rain-for-delhi-highest-in-14-years-101629570430162.html
21-08-2021||Mumbai||Rampant illegal sale of abortion pills across Maharashtra||Last month, a sari-clad 43-year-old woman from Wagholi, Pune, stood at a local smedical store waiting for the queue to thin out. When it did, she asked an employee of the store for an abortion pill adding that she needed it urgently. At first, the employee refused her request, but on her insistence, he asked her to wait since he had to source it from his friend.“He said he was not a supplier. He, however, considered my request and asked me to come after half an hour,” said the woman. After waiting for nearly two hours, the employee took her to an isolated alley near the store and handed over the abortion pill kit for ₹3,000 as opposed to the actual cost of ₹430. Reason: She didn’t have a prescription from a doctor.What this man didn’t know is that the woman posing as being pregnant was an undercover drug inspector with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) — the apex regulating body — who was part of a month-long investigation between July and August on retail and online illegal sale of abortion pills without doctor’s prescription. He was caught by FDA officers and a first information report (FIR) was registered. This is not an isolated case. Across the state, several chemist shops sell abortion pills, also known as medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) kits. Selling abortion pills without prescription and proof of age is illegal and a punishable offence under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (MTPA). Selling MTP kits without prescription is banned in India as per the Drug and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules of 1945. Acting on tip-offs, FDA inspected 384 medical stores till August first week. Several decoy customers were sent to purchase abortion pills without requisite documents and a total 14 cases have been registered in Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Nagpur, Aurangabad, Nashik and Amravati. Eleven accused have been arrested and drugs worth ₹47,378 have been seized. MTP kit is a schedule-H drug as per the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. It has a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol tablets which help in performing medical pregnancy termination (non-surgically expelling the embryo from the womb). Currently, abortion requires the opinion of one doctor if it is done within 12 weeks of conception and two doctors if it is done between 12 and 20 weeks. The investigationFDA officers focused on districts with skewed sex ratio. “These kind of illegal activities are most common in areas where there is a huge gap in sex ratio. So, first, we identified those districts, which were mostly from the western part of the state, and started sending our officers as customers,” said DR Gahane, joint commissioner, FDA Maharashtra. FDA officers said the investigation will also continue in other districts.During the investigation, they found out that most kits are being sold at exorbitant prices, taking advantage of helpless women. “Many a times, young needy women fall prey to these suppliers who exploit them by overcharging,” he said.Many medical stores and hospitals were also found in violation of not maintaining MTP records. In fact, an FIR has been registered against a doctor from the western region who refused to submit information about the usage of MTP kits.Doctors have warned that consumption of abortion pills without doctor’s supervision can even lead to the death due to health complications. Every month, major civic-run hospitals treat young women who complain of excessive bleeding after consuming the pills without doctor’s supervision. “A gynaecologist first conducts a sonography to confirm there is a pregnancy and to decide by how many weeks. If the woman then wants to terminate the pregnancy within the legal time period, she is given the prescription. It can sometimes lead to incomplete abortion causing heavy bleeding. This can prove fatal for the woman, especially if she is a minor,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair Hospital.Pan-India racketIn June, FDA office in Pune received a complaint from Pune Chemist Association that major online shopping portals are illegally selling abortion pills. FDA began their investigation where they scrutinised 34 online sites. “During our investigation, we found many portals selling MTP kits in violation of the law. We ordered the kits from the portals as customers to generate bills for our evidence. The first order came from a chemist shop in Ahmedabad against whom we have filed an FIR,” said Suresh Patil, joint commissioner, drug division, FDA Pune.All kits that were procured by drug inspectors were supplied from states such as Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Orissa. “In one case, the portal registered the order and took the money but didn’t supply the kit,” he said.FDA then sent notices to the portals seeking explanation. “These portals have replied saying they only provide a platform to sell anything, but have no role in the supply. We have advised them to include an option of uploading prescriptions on the website,” said DR Gahane, joint commissioner, FDA Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rampant-illegal-sale-of-abortion-pills-across-maharashtra-101629570130655.html
21-08-2021||Delhi||Showcause notice to 24 JNU students for not vacating library while night curfew was in place in Capital||The Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) administration has issued show-cause notices to 24 students for refusing to vacate the varsity’s central library in April past the night curfew put in place by the Delhi government, and have been asked for an explanation by August 27. The notices have been issued based on a complaint registered by the chief security office. “A complaint dated April 22, 2021 against you has been received in the chief proctor’s office from chief security office. In the said complaint, it has been stated that you were instructed to vacate the library as there was an announcement of night curfew on April 16, 2021 from Delhi government which you had refused and this act has violated the Covid-19 guidelines implemented in the university and government of India,” a show-cause notice from the university proctor’s office said.The notice also added that the students “explain their position” by August 27. “Upon failing your submission of deposition on the date and time mentioned, it shall be presumed that you have nothing to say in this matter and that you agree with the complaint. In such circumstances, the matter will be decided in your absence,” the notice issued on July 28 said.The Delhi government on April 6 imposed a night curfew between 10pm and 5am in the national capital amid a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases. The complaint also states that along with security guards instructing students not to enter the library after 10pm, announcements about the night curfew were made by security officers and on the PA system. Students present in the library, however, said there was little clarity on the protocol in place at the time.A student who has received the notice, on the condition of anonymity, said, “We went to the library as usual after dinner because students were previously allowed to study there till early morning. I had to work on assignments and planned to study till late at night. The allegations levelled against us state that we refused to vacate the library premises but there was no such instruction by anyone that day including the guards. There were some announcements but there wasn’t any clarity on it and we didn’t hear it.”Activists in the university said the administration was trying to “intimidate students”. Kaushik Raj, a PhD student and All India Students Association (AISA) member, said most of the notices he received in the past one month were related to protests on reopening campuses or allocation of hostel seats.“I have received around 20 notices in the past one month. Most of them are related to violation of Covid-19 guidelines on gatherings organised in the past six months on various issues including reopening of campus, demanding salary for sanitation workers, or allocation of hostel seats. Before the current administration, students rarely received show-cause notices due to protests or students’ resistance movements and the proctor office took up issues of indiscipline like fights or other matters. The political targeting and intimidating of students have begun under this vice-chancellor.”A senior official from the security office said, “The incident happened in April and I don’t remember much about it. The chief proctor office can explain why the notice was issued in July.” Despite repeated calls and messages, vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar and chief proctor Rajnish Kumar Mishra did not comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/showcause-notice-to-24-jnu-students-for-not-vacating-library-while-night-curfew-was-in-place-in-capital-101629569770050.html
21-08-2021||Delhi||Amid easing caseload, Delhi govt lifts 8pm deadline for city’s markets||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday lifted the Covid-induced restrictions on timings to open markets, allowing them to function beyond 8 pm starting Monday.“Till now, because of Covid-19, shops and enterprises in Delhi’s markets were allowed to open till 8 pm. In the light of the decline in cases, the timing restriction will be removed from Monday. Markets can now follow their usual working hours,” Kejriwal said in a Twitter post in Hindi.Earlier, the Delhi government allowed the markets to remain open only till 8 pm in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases. However, with cases and positivity rate under control, the new relaxations will be effective from next week.On Saturday, Delhi recorded 19 new Covid cases and a positivity rate of 0.03% -- against an average of 25,000 cases per day in late April when the Covid-19 surge was at its peak and a positivity rate that exceeded 35%.The decision comes in the backdrop of the Chamber of Trade and Industry (CTI) demanding an extension in the closing time of malls and markets in the national capital -- from the present 8 pm to 10 pm.“If the shops will open till late in the evening, then there will be no crowd in the market. Everyone will be able to do their work comfortably, Corona rules will also be followed well,” said the letter addressed to the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) earlier on Saturday.Welcoming the CM’s announcement, CTI chairman Brijesh Goyal said: “The weather is hot and humid now. A large number of customers prefer visiting the markets in the evening and late evening hours. Also, the festive season is ahead. So the time-related restriction was causing loss to traders, who have already been severely affected because of the pandemic. They were in favour of the restriction to be removed and assured full compliance to mask, distancing, and other Covid-19 guidelines.”Delhi was under a lockdown from April 19 to May 30 during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, as cases started declining, markets were allowed to open from June 7, under a phased reopening plan by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).Experts, however, warn that Covid-appropriate protocols must be followed strictly to evade a possible third wave of the pandemic.“Going for phased relaxation is a good strategy on part of the government. But they shall have to ensure that the markets are not crowded. Crowds and lack of social distancing can lead to an uptick in cases. But, more than anything, people have to act responsibly in public spaces,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases department at the Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/amid-easing-caseload-delhi-govt-lifts-8pm-deadline-for-city-s-markets-101629569590006.html
21-08-2021||Noida||Two former employees of service centre arrested for stealing car||Two former employees of a car service centre in Sector 85 were arrested on Friday for allegedly stealing a client’s car more than a month ago. Police said that the suspects approached the victim posing as staff of the service centre in Noida’s Sector 85 and fled with his car. The suspects were identified as Ajaypal Singh, 32, a resident of Sahibabad, and Hunny Kumar alias Lala, 30, a native of Meerut. Police said that Singh had worked as a general manager at the service centre and was sacked about six months ago. The complainant, Rajat Gupta, is a resident of Noida’s Sector 143 B, which comes under the Surajpur police station limits. Gupta said that he had contacted the service centre over phone on July 9. “An executive of the centre said a staffer will pick up my Hyundai i-20 for service the next day. On July 10, Lala called me at 7.45am informing that he was a representative of the car service centre and had come to pick up the car,” Gupta said. According to Gupta, Lala was in the uniform and he also gave a receiving slip before taking away the car. However, an hour later Gupta again received a call from the service centre informing him that a staffer was going to pick up his vehicle. Then he realised that he was cheated by the former employees of the car service centre. Gupta filed a complaint on July 17 at Surajpur police station when he was not able to get his car back. Ajay Kumar, station house officer of Surajpur police station, said that a case was registered against Lala under Section 406 (criminal breach of trust) of IPC. “We started tracing the mobile phone number used in making call. On Friday, we received information about his movement near Exotica Fresco society in Sector 137. We arrested him and recovered the mobile phone used in the crime,” he said.During interrogation, Lala revealed the name of Ajaypal Singh who was also arrested, police said. “Singh told police that he was terminated from the job. So, he decided to defame the service centre. Since he had worked there as a general manager, he managed to steal the details of Gupta’s pick-up order. He then engaged Lala, also a former employee of the centre, to commit the crime,” the SHO said. Police said that the suspects had fled with the car towards Ghaziabad. However, Madhuban police in Ghaziabad was conducting a checking drive at that time. The suspects feared they would be arrested so they abandoned the car on the roadside and fled the spot, police said, adding that the Ghaziabad police later seized the car. The suspects were produced in court that sent them to judicial custody, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/two-former-employees-of-service-centre-arrested-for-stealing-car-101629569229971.html
21-08-2021||Noida||Vaccine shortage, staff crunch mar ‘second dose day’ in Ghaziabad||The district health department on Saturday administered only 4,758 second doses of Covid-19 vaccine, out of the total 6,521 given on the day. Officials attributed the low vaccination numbers to paucity of vaccine and also to shortage of staff who were busy with routine immunisation for children.Saturday is observed as the ‘second dose day’ as directed by the UP government to improve coverage of second dose in the state. According to the Co-WIN portal, on August 14, the day when the ‘second dose day’ was started, the district administered 5,258 second doses (out of total 7,534). The average of the two second dose days is about 7,000 doses, while the district has administered a daily average of about 17,000 doses (total 136,216) from August 14 to August 21. The figures also indicate that the district administered 43,654 second doses during the period at an average of about 5,456 doses per day. The health officials said that they generally don’t have enough vaccine stock on Saturdays. “On August 14, we had about 7,500 doses and the figure for this Saturday was about 9,000. Further, our staff also get busy with routine immunisation on Saturday. However, we are trying to get more stock for Saturdays as well and hope to increase coverage of second dose,” said Dr GP Mathuria, nodal officer for Covid vaccination in Ghaziabad.The government has allowed walk-in facility for the day while giving 9am-11am slot preference to beneficiaries who book them online. Experts said the official figures indicate that there is hardly any benefit of the ‘second dose day’. “Maximum immunity against the virus gets developed only after the second dose is administered. Instead of Saturday, any weekdays like Monday or Tuesday should be reserved for second dose in order to improve second dose coverage,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). According to the Co-WIN portal, Ghaziabad district till 8.30pm on Saturday administered 1,815,102 overall doses, which included 357,256 second doses (19.68%). On the other hand, UP administered overall 63,509,137 doses, including 10,094,961 (15.89%) second doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/vaccine-shortage-staff-crunch-mar-second-dose-day-in-ghaziabad-101629569170488.html

21-08-2021||Noida||Heavy rains lash Noida and Ghaziabad, create chaos on major roads||Traffic was badly affected due to waterlogging in several parts of Ghaziabad and Noida as the two cities witnessed heavy rainfall on Saturday morning.In Ghaziabad, GT Road, NH-9, Delhi-Meerut Road and some internal roads of the city witnessed heavy traffic jams on Saturday. In neighbouring Noida, the vehicular movement was mainly affected at Labour Chowk, Sector 62 underpass, Kulesara road and the underpass towards Indirapuram in Ghaziabad due to waterlogging especially during the morning hours.Nitin Ashu, resident of Pratap Vihar in Ghaziabad, had to spend about three hours to reach district headquarters that otherwise would have taken 15 minutes on a normal day. “Since morning, the city witnessed heavy waterlogging and jams ensued as a result. First I went to Delhi-Meerut Expressway, but it had a long queue of vehicles. I returned to take Gaushala underpass that was completely submerged in water. Then I took GT Road, but didn’t get any relief from jam,” Ashu said. Kamiya Arora, a resident of Crossings Republik, had to meet the similar fate. “The worst affected stretch on the DME was at Lal Kuan which consumed almost two hours to cross over. Later, I somehow took a service lane towards GT Road to reach Kavi Nagar,” Arora said.Residents said that localities like Indirapuram, Vaishali, Vasundhara, and Shalimar Garden suffered heavy waterlogging. Vaishali resident BK Pandey said that his woes continued since he got up on Saturday morning. “I had to wade through knee-deep water to fetch milk. A rather worse situation prevailed in Indirapuram that remained waterlogged almost throughout the day,” Pandey added. The women commuters going to their relatives’ places to celebrate Rakshabandhan on Sunday were hit hard. “I started for my brother’s house in Meerut, and it took me about two hours to cross Ghaziabad as there were jams everywhere. The GT Road was jam packed with long queues of vehicles. Several stretches on GT Road were waterlogged that led to the traffic mess,” said Bhawna Yadav, a resident of Sahibabad. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Ghaziabad recorded an average rainfall of 24mm on Saturday. The automatic weather monitoring station at CDO Ghaziabad did not fetch records for morning, however, weather analysts believe the rainfall to be under heavy category. On the other hand, Noida recorded 79.5mm rainfall till Saturday 8.30am, while on average (between Friday 5.30pm to Saturday 5.30pm), the city recorded 25mm rainfall.The traffic police said that they toiled hard throughout the day to manage the traffic on roads. “Besides traffic police personnel, we also roped in police post in-charges to help clear the traffic jams. Some of the major roads have issues of waterlogging which resulted in long jams,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic), Ghaziabad.The precarious situation led top officials of the Ghaziabad municipal corporation to conduct inspections in different areas. They said that the city has 525 small and big drains that were cleaned before the monsoon, but some of them developed fresh garbage deposits. “We employed several teams to clear out garbage from drains. The next two days will be crucial and we have asked officials concerned to ensure that there is no waterlogging in the city,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner. In Noida, traffic police officials said that heavy rainfall led to waterlogging at several underpasses that caused traffic snarls. “Heavy rainfall led to waterlogged underpasses at sectors 60 and 72, causing traffic jams especially in the morning hours. The similar situation prevailed at Labour Chowk and Kulesara. However, at DND cut and Mahamaya Flyover, the traffic was normal as the water was pumped out before 8am,” said an official from the traffic police department.Officials of the Noida authority said that the workers were rushed to clear the stretches. “As the rainfall was heavy, there were some instances of waterlogging, but our workers were rushed to affected areas, including Labour Chowk, sectors 37, 60 and City Centre underpasses. The water was removed from roads by around 12 noon,” said an authority official, requesting anonymity. Meanwhile, the Ghaziabad municipal commissioner on Saturday night issued a roster in which three officers each were deputed for 13 worst affected waterlogged areas. They have been deputed for 24 hours and will operate in shifts. The order also stated that one senior officer will be deputed for each of the five zones of the city. The 13 worst affected areas include New Bus Adda to Patel Nagar, Gandhi Nagar, Nehru Nagar, Navyug Market, Lohiya Nagar, Seemant Vihar (Kaushambi), Brij Vihar, Mohan Nagar, Apsara Border, Rajendra Nagar, Pandav Nagar, Karpuripuram and Govindpuram, among others.Meanwhile, the weather analysts said that there are chances of light to moderate rainfall on Sunday.“Region will continue receiving rainfall for another two days till August 23. There are chances of moderate rainfall on Sunday which will drop towards Monday to light rainfall. After that, the region may see a temporary break monsoon condition for a few days,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/heavy-rains-lash-noida-and-ghaziabad-create-chaos-on-major-roads-101629569050016.html
21-08-2021||Gurugram||Bank fraud accused procured 500 SIM cards using forged papers: Cops||Two days after a 48-year-old former bank loan agent was arrested for allegedly duping people and transferring amounts from their account by linking his mobile number, the police said that he had forged documents to get 500 SIM cards that were used in committing the crime.The police said the investigation of the banking fraud executed by the conman has turned the spotlight on the irregularities in issuing SIM cards by a leading telecom company. Bank officials are already under investigation for their role in the frauds.The Gurugram police on Saturday filed a case in connection with the issuance of 500 SIM cards by Airtel in violation of the norms of the Department of Telecommunications (DOT).KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that the second FIR in the banking fraud case was filed against the persons who had supplied SIM cards to the suspect, identified as Praveen Mittal (48), without proper documents. “The suspect, in connivance with the staff of Airtel, had allegedly procured 500 SIM cards and sold them to different persons illegally. Most of these SIM cards were used for illegal activities and fraud. One of these SIM cards was used by Mittal to transfer ₹1.39 crore from the bank account of a farmer, who had received compensation for land acquisition in Gurugram. The SIM card, obtained without proper documentation, was of major use in the execution of the fraud,” he said.Mittal, of Haryana’s Sonepat, lived in Gurugram and worked as a loan agent for several nationalised banks. The police said the suspect and his aides executed a series of banking frauds in at least three northern states.One of Mittal’s aides, identified as Dinesh Sharma, who runs a placement agency, prepared fake documents of a recruitment company and managed to get 500 SIM cards fraudulently issued in connivance with officials of Airtel, the police said. “These SIM cards could have been used for anti-national activities as well,” said Rao.A spokesperson for Airtel telecom, through a statement issued on Saturday, said, “As a law-abiding corporate, we have extended full cooperation to the authorities and will continue to assist them. Since the matter is sub judice, we will be unable to comment further.”The FIR was registered under sections 419 (cheating personation), 420 (cheating), 468 (forgery) and 471 (using forged document) of the Indian Penal Code at Sector 37 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/bank-fraud-accused-procured-500-sim-cards-using-forged-papers-cops-101629568691610.html
21-08-2021||Noida||Fruit vendor stabbed to death in Noida, suspect held||A 20-year-old fruit vendor was allegedly stabbed to death by another fruit seller in a market in Noida Phase 2 on Friday evening. The suspect, Farman, 22, was arrested on Saturday, police said.Police said Farman is a native of Sikandrabad in Bulandshahr. The victim was identified as Kasim, a resident of Bhangel. Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said, “The two persons worked next to each other. It appears they had developed rivalry. On Friday evening, the two persons quarrelled over placing their cart at a certain spot. Farman took out a knife and stabbed Kasim in his thighs multiple times.” Local people and other shopkeepers raised an alarm and informed police. A team from Phase 2 police station reached the spot and admitted Kasim to the district hospital in Sector 30. However, he died during treatment, police said.Based on the complaint filed by victim’s kin, a case was registered against Farman under Section 302 (murder) of IPC. “We have arrested Farman from Phase 2 area and recovered the knife used in the crime. He was produced in court that sent him to judicial custody,” Chander said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/fruit-vendor-stabbed-to-death-in-noida-suspect-held-101629568449899.html
21-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi transport department approves 4.5k+ e-auto permits in Capital||The Delhi transport department approved the issuance of 4,561 permits for operating electric autorickshaws (e-autos), of which one-third will be reserved for women applicants, a senior government official said on Saturday.“The government will now invite applications from individuals for availing the 4,561 permits very soon and 33% of the permits will be reserved for women drivers,” the official said, not wishing to be named.The official cited above said that there is a huge demand to increase the number of autos and taxis driven by women, for the convenience of women commuters in the city.“While men (applicants) will require public service vehicle (PSV) badges to apply for an e-auto permit, women can do so with an existing licence that applies to light vehicles. Women applicants who avail of the permits will get additional three months to get a PSV badge done,” the official said.The e-auto plan is part of the government’s comprehensive electric vehicle (EV) policy notified in August 2020. The policy aims to ensure that at least 25% of total vehicles registered in Delhi, by 2025, are e-vehicles. The EV policy is part of the government’s long-term action plan to fight air pollution in Delhi.Parallelly, the government also is working on setting up EV Infrastructure in Delhi, which involves setting up 500 charging points at 100 locations, incentive policy on scrapping of fuel vehicles for e-vehicles, and tying up with private players to endorse electric vehicles and set up charging stations. Even government vehicles are being switched to electric ones under an order issued earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-transport-department-approves-4-5k-e-auto-permits-in-capital-101629567729708.html
21-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body set to ramp up Covid testing||Keeping the festival season in mind, starting with Raksha Bandhan on Sunday, and amid the relaxations implemented since the past 10 days, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) may soon increase daily testing of samples for Covid-19. In the past two days, BMC has conducted a dry run by doubling its number of tests, so as to gauge the situation. For example: Over 50,000 tests have been conducted in the past two days, the majority of which are rapid antigen kits. This is an increase from the daily 25,000 to 35,000 tests conducted until Wednesday. According to officials, more testing leads to faster detection of cases, which results in early tracing of infected citizens. As per predictions of experts and authorities, the third wave of Covid-19 is likely to happen between September and October, during the festival season.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “In the last two days, we did a trial run by increasing our testing numbers above 50,000. However, it will remain around 35,000 for now. But in the coming days, depending on the situation, we may increase testing.” He added, “When we increase testing, major reliance will be on RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests. Ultimately, when we have to increase testing, we will have to focus on places with high footfall. For example: Malls again, depending on whether they are open; hawkers and shopkeepers. We will target those who have multiple chances of contact.” In Mumbai, as of August 19, 740,290 Covid cases have been detected by testing 8,855,005 samples. The overall positivity rate is 8.36% and daily positivity rate is between 0.5% and 1% over the past few days. The city on Saturday reported 262 cases and five deaths. Prashant Gaikwad, assistant municipal commissioner of D ward, which covers Malabar Hill and Tardeo, said, “There are many areas in my ward where citizens are going outstation for work. On return, they get tested and there are times even their families get tested. This helps in early testing and tracing. ” Dr Madhav Sathe, retired microbiology professor at Nair hospital, said, “Looking at relaxations and festivals coming up, we should have 40,000-50,000 tests in Mumbai, of which 60% should be RT-PCR and 40% rapid antigen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-set-to-ramp-up-covid-testing-101629565570470.html
21-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Need 50, but only 11 children participate in ZyCoV-D vaccination trial||Even after a month of starting clinical trials of the indigenous ZyCoV-D vaccine among children at the civic-run BYL Nair hospital, the response of young volunteers remains lukewarm. Although the trial needs 50 children between the age group of 12 and 17 years, the hospital has received only 11 volunteers. The Drug Controller General on Friday granted emergency approval to the Zycov-D, a Covid-19 vaccine developed by Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila, and it will be administered to people 12 years and above. This makes it the first vaccine in India that can be administered to adults as well as children above 12 years. In the second week of July, Nair Hospital became the first hospital in Mumbai to start clinical trials of the vaccine among children. As per officials, initially they received over 40 queries from parents who wanted to enrol their children for their trial. However, eventually they all backed out. So far, only 11 children have taken the first shot of the vaccine under the clinical trial. “We have placed advertisements about the clinical trial to encourage people to enrol their children for the trial. But due to scepticism and lack of awareness, parents back off later. We have got only 11 children at present, who all have taken the first shot of the vaccine,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean, Nair hospital.The hospital hasn’t recorded any severe side effects of the drug among the children. Fifty percent of the volunteers will be provided with a placebo. Zycov-D is a ‘plasmid DNA’ vaccine, a first-of-its-kind vaccine that uses a genetically engineered DNA molecule known as a ‘plasmid’ which is coded to generate spike protein of the Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. It elicits an immune response against it and develops antibodies. On July 1, in a statement, the manufacturer declared that they have recorded 66.6% ‘primary efficacy’ in their ‘interim analysis’.A total of three doses will be given to the volunteers. After the first dose, the second and third doses will be given after a gap of 28 and 56 days, respectively. As per protocol, along with written consent, an audio-visual consent of the parents of the children is also required for the trial.With the intention of sensitising parents, the hospital has also started two helpline numbers— 022-23027205 and 23027204. Parents who want to enrol their children in the trial can call on these numbers and clear their doubts. “Every day, we receive around 7-10 enquiries about the trial. Many also visit our hospital asking about the clinical trial, but eventually they don’t enrol their children,” said Dr Bharmal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-need-50-but-only-11-children-participate-in-zycov-d-vaccination-trial-101629565150677.html
21-08-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena ups attack on BJP over Devendra Fadnavis’s Taliban comment||A day after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis said Shiv Sena workers’ act to “purify” Bal Thackeray’s makeshift memorial showed “Talibani mindset”, Sena leader Sanjay Raut hit back saying the party is a pro-Hindutva party that stood beside Hindus when the BJP shirked away from responsibility of Babri Masjid demolition.On Thursday, amid heavy police force deployment, Union minister Narayan Rane visited Thackeray’s Smruti Sthal in Shivaji Park. Hours after his visit, Shiv Sainiks carried out “purification” of the memorial by sprinkling cow urine and milk. Fadnavis had on Friday said, “ Sena’s ‘purification’ at the memorial can be equated to Talibani mindset. Those who indulged in such an act have not understood Bal Thackeray’s Shiv Sena. It is unfortunate.” Raut, without naming either Fadnavis or BJP, said the leaders of the party had locked themselves in their homes while Sena workers faced rioters during the 1992 riots in Mumbai.“Everybody right from [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi to Fadnavis know what is the mindset of the Shiv Sena. We are a staunch Hindutvawadi party, and whenever there was a threat on Hindus, the Shiv Sena and Shiv Sena chief (referring to Bal Thackeray) became a shield and stood beside the people. Those who did not take responsibility of Babri demolition must not call us Talibani. We were nationalist, and therefore, that blot was removed. In the 1992 Mumbai riots, on the orders of Shiv Sena chief, Shiv Sainiks took to streets and faced rioters. That time, these people had locked themselves in their homes, but are now calling us Talibani. You may call us whatever you choose, but we know our soul,” Raut said.The Sena leader also raked up the Marathi manoos issue saying the Sena was established for the cause of “Marathi manoos” and will continue to fight for the sons of the soils whenever they are in trouble. He added that the BJP is attempting to corner Sena over its Hindutva credential, while former Sena leader Narayan Rane has targeted his former party over the sons of the soil issue. The war of words is expected to intensify between the two parties with Rane targetting the Sena during his Konkan tour, which is a stronghold of Sena.Attacking Sena on Saturday, Rane said instead of sprinkling cow urine, the state government should look at improving the atmosphere and basic amenities for small business owners. “Over 350 companies are shut because there is no power supply. I will speak to the minister here and try to get it. Over 350,000 people do not have jobs as these 350 companies are shut. Those who sprinkle cow urine are unaware of this. Instead of sprinkling that, create jobs and strengthen the financial condition,” Rane said in Vasai-Virar during his Jan Ashirwad Yatra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-ups-attack-on-bjp-over-devendra-fadnavis-s-taliban-comment-101629565090083.html
21-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: NCP drive to counter ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’||Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Saturday announced a drive to counter the ongoing ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’ started by four newly inducted Union ministers from the Central government in Maharashtra. The party has decided to hold press conferences in various districts to ‘’point out’’ how the Narendra Modi-led government allegedly failed in dealing with critical issues such as inflation, unemployment, rising fuel prices, Covid mitigation, vaccination drive among others.“We have decided to expose the failure of the Central government by creating awareness. For this, we have decided to hold media interactions in different areas in the coming days. In the first leg, five press conferences will be held in the next four days starting Saturday. In the next phase, another region will be selected and similarly, all the regions of the state will be covered one by one,” said Mahesh Tapase, state spokesperson, NCP.“We will prove this by comparing the performances of UPA-1 and UPA-2 with the first and second term of the Modi-led government. See the rising inflation, rise in fuel prices, unemployment, Covid management, vaccination drive etc. There is not a single area where this government has performed better,” he added.In the first phases, the press conferences will be held at Vasai, Aurangabad, Alibaug, Ratnagiri and Sindhdurg.Sanjay Tatkare, another spokesperson of the party said the locations have been selected from where ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’ was held. “We want to put our side of the story before the people. We will also show the people how BJP is misleading them by putting facts and figures. This is the reason the party has selected the same locations where ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’ was held,” Tatkare said.Ahead of the forthcoming local body elections, the state BJP unit is looking at an opportunity to take the Central schemes to the people and also expose the alleged failure of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government being run by Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress.Four new ministers — Rajya Sabha MPs Narayan Rane and Dr Bhagwat Karad, and MPs Kapil Patil and Dr Bharti Pawar — who were inducted into the Modi government as part of the cabinet reshuffle on July 7 were asked to hold ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’. It started on August 16, while Rane started the yatra on August 19.More than 15 municipal corporations (including Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane), 29 of 36 district councils and over 90 municipal councils will go for polls over the next 18 months. The election bandwagon to these local bodies in such a huge number is considered as the mini-Assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-ncp-drive-to-counter-jan-ashirwad-yatra-101629564670876.html
21-08-2021||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay researchers develop first-ever indigenous semiconductor memory technology||Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) have invented the first-ever indigenous semiconductor memory technology that can be adopted for manufacturing at commercial unit of 180nm node in India.Memory is a critical aspect of the internet-of-things (IoT), a network of objects embedded with sensors or chips for exchange of data over a wireless network without the intervention of humans. Memories are used to customise chips by giving them user-specific storage of digital data. IoT connects tiny chips, which are all identical but distinguished by an identity (a barcode) stored in the memory. This data is stored within metal-insulator-metal (MIM) memory cells on a silicon integrated circuit memory chip. At a time when IoT is disrupting the semiconductor industry worldwide, the semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem led by Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL), Mohali, department of space, Government of India, had to import the main technology from abroad. However, a team of researchers at IIT-B led by Udayan Ganguly, professor in the department of electrical engineering, along with SCL have successfully demonstrated a CMOS-180nm-based 8-bit memory technology. This technology is adopted for production. Ideally, silicon chips (like thermometers) should be identical, but manufacturing variations produce tiny offsets (such as errors in temperatures) which are revealed upon testing. This renders a large fraction of chips useless. The technology designed by the IIT-B team enables storing this tiny offset correction in memory once and applying it to the output afterward to make each imperfect chip perfect. Using this method, generic chips can now be designed and make application-specific offsets added to make expensive custom chip design redundant, saving time and money for the user. “One out of 100 ideas makes the journey from lab to fab. The exacting process of exceeding 95% yield requires an unrelenting multi-disciplinary team supported by a world-class R&D infrastructure to form an enduring collaboration. Once such successful technology opens possibilities of touching countless lives, in this case, through chips with a tiny memory,” said Ganguly. This one-time programmable (OTP) memory is based on ultra-thin deposited silicon dioxide instead of the existing gate oxide-based OTP technology. In contrast to the high voltage required by gate oxide breakdown (a popular OTP memory), IIT-B’s memory chip requires less power and chip-area as the need for boosted voltage supply is avoided. “Memory technology is critical to data security. It is essential for present and future Indian Fabs. To infuse innovation, translating memory technology from research to manufacturing is the key to compete globally and serve locally to establish a vibrant semiconductor ecosystem. The OTP Memory Technology Adoption for Trimming Application by the joint IIT-B-SCL, Chandigarh team is a pioneering step in this direction. It will be a game changer by enabling secure memory and encryption hardware for the country,” said VK Saraswat, member of NITI Aayog. The project was initiated by the department of science and technology’s (DST) Intensification of Research in High Priority Area (IRHPA). Aspects of the work were funded by DST’s Nanoelectronics Network for Research and Applications (NNetRA), DST-Advanced Manufacturing Technologies, and office of PSA for hardware security. The team at IIT-B partnered with IIT-Delhi, SETS Chennai, and Defence Research and Development Organisation for hardware encryption. “The success of the Digital India initiative by the Government of India has underpinnings in our country’s ability to manufacture electronics hardware. The focus on electronics hardware including integrated circuits or chips is key to strengthen R&D primarily in space and defence sectors. Development of standard, product design or IP development, and semiconductor manufacturing are increasingly important. Improving India’s participation in this area is a major priority for R&D in India. The partnership between IIT-B and SCL to establish this memory technology for the first time demonstrates the augmented potential for semiconductor research in the country,” said K Vijay Raghavan, principal scientific adviser (PSA) to the Government of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iitbombay-researchers-develop-first-ever-indigenous-semiconductor-memory-technology-101629564669919.html
21-08-2021||Mumbai||Shinde frustrated over Sena matters, looking for alternatives: Rane||Newly inducted Union minister Narayan Rane on Saturday made serious allegations against Shiv Sena and said all the files related to the urban development department (UDD) are being cleared by the Matoshri, residence of Shiv Sena chief and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. He claimed that senior Sena minister Eknath Shinde is fed up with his party as he has no powers and is looking for alternatives.Shinde is a senior Sena leader and holds the urban development department in the MVA government.From August 19, Rane is on ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’ in the state covering most of the districts of the Konkan region. On Saturday he was in Vasai where he made the statement.“Though he (Eknath Shinde) is the urban development minister in the MVA government, he is being used only to sign files. The rest is in the hands of ‘son’, who is also a minister and another person who is not in politics and thus I’m not taking his name. No file from the urban development department can be cleared without approval from Matoshri (Thackeray’s residence),” Rane alleged without naming Aaditya Thackeray, son and environment minister in the MVA government.“He (Eknath Shinde) is frustrated and tired of this and is looking for alternatives… I will provide for him one day,” the Union minister said, indicating unrest in the party.Rane has been a bitter critic of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray since he was expelled from Shiv Sena. He launched an offensive against Shiv Sena from the beginning of ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’.Rane also predicted that the Thackeray-led MVA government will fall soon.In response, Shiv Sena said there is no unrest in the party and Rane is making all the baseless allegations to please his bosses. “There is no unrest in Shiv Sena. Shinde is one of the best performing ministers and is the first person who reaches the spot if an incident happens. Rane suddenly has got a position and thus he is making all the allegations to show his bosses that he is doing something,” said Manisha Kayande, Sena spokesperson.She also alleged the BJP is reeling with unrest and not Shiv Sena. “BJP has no leader who can lead the party in the upcoming BMC elections. This is the reason BJP loyalists have been sidelined and Rane is being projected. Thus there is unrest in the BJP and not in Shiv Sena,” she slammed.All the four newly inducted ministers in the Narendra Modi government have started ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’ in the state since last week. Ahead of the upcoming local body elections, the state BJP unit is looking at an opportunity to take the central schemes to the people and also expose the alleged failure of the Thackeray government being run by Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/eknath-shinde-fed-up-with-his-party-looking-for-alternatives-alleges-narayan-rane-101629564429769.html

21-08-2021||Patna||Elevated 9-km-long road at Rajgir to offer a ‘monumental’ drive||The 9-km-long congested stretch of National Highway 82 at Rajgir, which connects Gaya to Biharsharif through reserve forest and historical places, would be developed as a four-lane elevated road, a senior official in the state’s road construction department (RCD) said.The Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) has given its consent to the RCD for alignment of the elevated bypass on existing two-lane road — from Vanganga to the SDM office — following chief minister Nitish Kumar’s insistence to ensure seamless traffic on the stretch without impacting charm of the place, the official said.While the RCD is building the Gaya-Biharsharif portion of national highway as four-lane from the funding of MoRTH, the work on the road between Vanganga and SDM office was left unattended lest it may take a toll on archaeological attractions like Bimbisar Jail, Chariot Wheel Mark, Maniyar Math, Cyclopean Wall, etc.Additional chief secretary (RCD) Amrit Lal Meena said pre-construction activities like forest clearance and utilities shifting would start as the MoRTH has cleared the new alignment. “The 8.7-km-long elevated road would be made in cable stayed style in addition to four-km long four-lane at-grade road. The entire project is likely to cost ₹1,300 crore,” said Meena, adding that the MoRTH gave its clearance to the elevated road on Friday. The Central government has allocated a sum of ₹2,000 crore for building the NH from Gaya to Biharsharif via Rajgir. “Of the total, ₹900 crore has been spent on land acquisition. With elevated road being added, the entire project cost would go up to ₹3,200 crore,” said an officer of the RCD, adding that the road portion of the NH is likely to be complete by March next year.An engineer with RCD said the corridor would pass through at least 10 historical monuments and a portion of the reserve forest area and hence would offer a scenic view to commuters. The road is also important as it connects Rajgir with other important cities like Patna, Nawada, Jamshedpur, Koderma and Kolkata. “The CM visited the spot twice in the last couple of years and personally suggested the alignment of elevated structure,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/elevated-9-km-long-road-at-rajgir-to-offer-a-monumental-drive-101629562989465.html

These hydel projects will change the fate of poor tribal and scheduled caste people on Kaimur hills. It is a good coincidence that the Union power minister is here,” Paswan said.He was referring to the Bihar State Hydroelectric Power Corporation’s (BHPC) proposal for setting up hydel power projects at Sinafdar (345 MW), Telhar Kund (400 MW), Panchgotia (225 MW) on river Suara and Hathiadah-Durgawati (1600 MW) on river Durgawati in the hilly region of Kaimur district’s Adhaura block, which has been awaiting clearance for a long time despite the completion of major legwork, including feasibility studies for the project between year 2000 and 2010, officials aware of the developments said.The preliminary project reports along with clarifications and details sought by the Central agencies were duly furnished by BHPC during this period and the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) also conducted surveys of the four sites and made a pre-feasibility report. Not just that, a team of Japan Bank of International Cooperation, renamed as Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), too got a project viability assessment done, officials said.“A study commissioned by JICA found the Hathiadah-Durgawati project to be very attractive and agreed to extend financial assistance,” said LP Sinha, retired BHPC managing director who worked on the project proposals during his tenure.Rameshwar Singh, the then principal secretary (energy) in Bihar, wrote on September 29, 2010, to the Union ministry of power highlighting how these environment-friendly and carbon emission-free projects were likely to result in rapid augmentation of power generation, stability of transmission and meeting the state’s power demand, MP Chhedi Paswan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-leaders-in-kaimur-hills-push-for-hydel-projects-with-power-minister-101629562930791.html

They keep coming up with some issue or the other to corner the PM. This is a desperate attempt by the Congress party as even regional parties have stopped giving much importance to them as they know the Congress is no more a political force,” said Islam.Accusing the opposition, especially the Congress for disruption in Parliament processing, Islam said, had the opposition parties cared about people they would have discussed the issues related to people on the floor of the House.“We saw unprecedented scenes in Parliament where opposition parties were whistling and scaling the reporters’ table. They did not even spare the woman marshal and attacked her. The PM had clearly said, in the all-party meeting, that the government was ready to hold discussions on any issue, be it economy, Pegasus or farmers row. But the Opposition chose to create a din,” he said.BJP forms human chain against Hemant govtMeanwhile, the state unit of the BJP protested against the ‘anti-people’s policies’ of the Hemant Soren government by forming human chains at headquarters of the 267 administrative blocks across the state.Islam joined state president and Rajya Sabha member Deepak Prakash at one such protest at Morhabadi ground in the state capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/removing-pm-modi-only-agenda-of-opposition-101629562869585.html

21-08-2021||Mumbai||Domestic air traffic from tier 2 to metro more than between metros: Travel portals||Domestic air traffic has witnessed an increase as the Covid-19 positivity rate in the country continues to remain low. Travel portals have said that the domestic fliers from tier 2 cities travelling to the metros have led to the growth in air traffic as compared to fliers from metro cities. According to the portals, there has been around 35% in the air traffic from tier 2 to metros. Nishant Pitti, chief executive officer (CEO) and co-founder of EaseMyTrip.com, said there has been a surge in air travel to smaller destinations post the second wave, as people want to reduce travel time and are ready to spend more money to travel on a direct flight to reach their destinations. “Metro-metro and non-metro to metro travel are bouncing back. Bookings from cities like Varanasi, Darbhanga, Patna, Gorakhpur to metros have seen a jump of 30-35% in the last one month,” says Aloke Bajpai, co-founder and group CEO of ixigo.Destinations such as Patna, Varanasi, and Srinagar are making up for most of the top 10 busiest routes in the country since May. “Even in December, when airlines could deploy 80% of their capacity, half of the top 10 routes were to tier-2 cities. For the period of January -June 2021, EaseMyTrip has observed that flight bookings to Delhi from tier 2 cities such as Srinagar and Patna were around 20% higher than the flights to Delhi from metros such as Mumbai and Bengaluru,” Pitti said.With ease in Covid-19 related lockdown restrictions and a decline in cases, portals said this trend will sustain. A surge in last-minute bookings and an increase in average ticket size for popular destinations such as Mussoorie, Mount Abu, Shimla and the likes. “In the aftermath of the second wave, we’ve observed a sharp upward trend in consumer’s preferences for smaller cities such as Lucknow, Patna, Noida, Jaipur, Kochi, Guwahati, Agra. OYO’s occupancy has improved significantly in July and August. Currently, we are seeing nearly 80% occupancy compared to pre-Covid wave 2 in February 2021. This showcases the country’s aspirations to explore domestic destinations closer to home since people are still wary about long-haul international air travel,” said Yatish Jain, vice president and chief growth officer, OYO INSEA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/domestic-air-traffic-from-tier-2-to-metro-more-than-between-metros-travel-portals-101629557709128.html
21-08-2021||Mumbai||Pandemic effect: RSS changes mode of functioning, focuses on yoga, pranayama to boost immunity||The Covid-19 pandemic induced lockdown has led to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s (RSS) shakhas changing their mode of functioning. These shakhas or branches which were earlier held in open spaces, parks or grounds, are now being conducted in cyberspace using platforms like WebEx and Google Meet. Confirming to the requirements of this virtual medium and the need of the hour, these shakhas have changed their focus from physical games and exercises to include yoga and exercises and games meant to boost immunity and general knowledge.“Earlier, our physical activities included games using the danda (lathi) like dandagol (where players from competing teams toss and catch a lathi to score a goal), atya-patya (a traditional game) and ‘Angad ka Pair’ (which involves testing the physical strength of participants by making them lift each other’s leg that is firmly planted on the ground),” said a senior RSS functionary, who is part of the physical training department of the organisation. “Now, we are focussing on yoga, pranayama and such exercises meant to boost immunity and respiratory health. The virtual shakhas also see games like performing maximum push-ups, Surya namaskars or squats in a certain time-limit like one minute,” he explained.The newly designed games include those in which the names of icons have to be arranged in chronological order or rearranging their names from shuffled alphabets, recognising historical figures from their headgear and a quiz with questions based on religious epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata. The RSS office-bearer said that they had used an illustrated book on traditional Maharashtrian games that were published by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwar of Baroda and adapted some of these for their shakhas.“It is the character of the Sangh to adapt to the times... As shakhas went online, the games too were upgraded and new activities introduced,” said Ajay Mudpe, prachar pramukh (propaganda chief) of the Konkan prant. At present, while Mumbai has around 350 online and offline shakhas, each with an average attendance of 15 swayamsevaks, the Konkan prant, under which it falls, has about 700 shakhas, down from 450 and 900 respectively during pre-Covid times, said an RSS office-bearer. Around 250 shakhas have also begun physically across the Konkan prant with physical distancing norms but are not playing games like kabaddi since they involve physical proximity.The shakhas are divided into bal (children), tarun (youth), vyavasayik (professionals) and saptahik milan (weekly sessions for professionals like those in the I.T sector) and further into Prabhat (morning), sayan (evening) and ratra (night) shakhas, based on their timings. While the normal shakhas are organised for one hour, the duration of the saptahik milan is one-and-half hours.In April, a special program where shakhas were conducted online nationwide was attended by around 48 lakh participants, said another Sangh office-bearer.BOX:The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) was started on Vijayadashmi Day in 1925 by Dr Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, Ganesh Damodar ‘Babarao’ Savarkar, Dr BS Moonje, Dr LV Paranjpe and Dr BB Tholkar.The right-wing organisation got its present name in April 1926.The RSS was banned after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi in 1948 and formed the Bharatiya Jan Sangh (BJS) in 1951 as the predecessor of the present-day Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The RSS is the ideological fountainhead of the BJP and other organisations in the larger Sangh Parivar universe. At present, the RSS has around 52,000 operational shakhas across the country.The Sangh’s organisational structure in Maharashtra is divided into four prants or regions, namely Konkan (including Mumbai), Vidarbha, Western Maharashtra, and Devgiri (Marathwada).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pandemic-effect-rss-changes-mode-of-functioning-focuses-on-yoga-pranayama-to-boost-immunity-101629557049103.html
21-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: NEET centre far from home, say aspirants||Several aspirants of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) have complained that they have been allotted test centres far away from their place of residence and their preferred choice of centre. Amid Covid-19 restrictions, aspirants said, travel to far off centres was difficult. Over 12 lakh medical aspirants are expected to take the NEET for admission to undergraduate medical and dental courses at 202 centres across the country on September 12. “My friends and I had opted for a test centre in Akola. My second choice was Amravati which is at least 150 kilometres away from where I live. All my friends have got Akola as their test centres. I have to travel to Amravati instead. Travelling during Covid-19 times is tough as means of travel are restricted,” said Mohamad Junaid Siddiquee, an aspirant from Akola. National Testing Agency (NTA), the nodal agency that conducts NEET, said most candidates were allotted test centres of preference. “Most candidates, almost 99% of all those who have registered, have been asked to take the test from their first preferred centre. However, candidates who are not happy with their centres can write to us. Depending on the merit of the case, we may make some adjustments to accommodate the students,” said Vineet Joshi, director-general, NTA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-neet-centre-far-from-home-say-aspirants-101629556749080.html

Both the PMC and forest department will be working jointly to develop the urban forest,” she said.According to the forest department, Sanjeevan Udyan will also be known as ‘oxygen park’ where landscaping, beautification, pollution control and planting of medicinal herbs and plants will be given top priority. Rahul Patil, deputy conservator of forests for the Pune region, said that the forest department will offer all support, including trees to be planted on a 35-acre land parcel. Meanwhile, Pawar directed the forest department to plan and speed up the planting of trees on hills and open forest lands and urged authorities to give priority to the planting of native trees in the area.Officials of the forest department said that urban forests are being developed on the lines of the union government’s ambitious programme where these play an important role in the ecology of human habitats in many ways. Apart from beautifying the urban environment, they will benefit such as positively impacting the climate and economy while providing shelter to wildlife as also a recreational area for city dwellers, they said.Four years ago, under a unique experiment, the Maharashtra forest department joined hands with TERRE Policy, a city-based NGO; Tata Motors; and Persistent Foundation to transform a barren hill into an urban forest named Smriti Van which now boasts over 6,500 adult trees, some of them nearly 25 to 30 feet tall. Not only is this urban forest project helping maintain the ecological balance, but it is also providing citizens with a walkway and place for morning and evening walks. Spanning 25 hectares of urban wasteland in Warje, the forest is home to several species of flora and fauna and is frequented by more than 1,500 nature-lovers daily. The Warje urban forest has become a role model for the rest of the country and was inaugurated by the then environment minister Prakash Javadekar under the ambitious urban forestry programme covering 200 city corporations in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-forest-dept-to-develop-35-acre-urban-forest-in-warje-malwadi-101629556208330.html

21-08-2021||Pune||Three service chiefs visit NDA in Pune||The chiefs of the Indian Army, the Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force visited the National Defence Academy (NDA), Khadakwasla, their alma-mater on Friday. The visit assumes significance in the backdrop of the recent Supreme Court interim order allowing women to appear for the NDA entrance exam.In an interim order on August 18, the Supreme Court directed the Centre to allow women to take the next entrance exam for NDA, thus far a male preserve.The chiefs reviewed the ongoing training of cadets and the available training and administrative infrastructure of NDA.The visit marks a rare moment for the tri-service training academy as all three service chiefs are course-mates from the 56th course of NDA.Earlier, it was only in 1991 that all three service chiefs were course mates from the first NDA (erstwhile joint services wing) course.During their visit, the chiefs paid homage at the ‘Hut of Remembrance’, which commemorates the sacrifice of ex-NDA officers of Armed Forces who laid down their lives in the line of duty. The service chiefs also visited their parent squadrons ‘Hunter’ (Naval Chief) & ‘Lima’ (Army & Air Chiefs), and interacted with the cadets of the respective squadrons. Interaction with the faculty and staff of NDA was also organised towards the end of their visit.“Their visit to the academy has provided unmatched inspiration and sense of pride to all the cadets and would further catalyse them to strive for excellence in their military careers and reinforce the spirit of camaraderie and joint manship amongst the three services,” said defence PRO in a release.The idea of establishing the joint training academy for training officers of three services was conceived by a committee headed by the then commander-in-chief of the Indian Army, Field Marshal Sir Claude Auchinleck in 1945 and the academy commenced functioning in its interim location at Dehradun as joint service wing in January 1949.The foundation stone of the academy at Khadakwasla was laid on October 6, 1949, and inaugurated on January 16, 1955. In its glorious history of over seven decades, the academy has produced the first chief of the defence staff, 13 chiefs of Army staff, 11 chiefs of Navy staff and 9 chiefs of the air staff.Admiral Karambir Singh, assumed as the chief of the Naval Staff on May 31, 2019, while Air Chief Marshal Rakesh Kumar Singh Bhadauria took over as chief of the Air Staff on September 30, 2019, and General MM Naravane, took over as Chief of the Army Staff on December 31, 2019.Speaking on behalf of the three chiefs on this historical occasion the chief of the Naval staff dwelled upon the emerging trends of modern warfare.

21-08-2021||Chandigarh||Taliban takeover could impact security in border areas: Manish Tewari||Congress MP and spokesman Manish Tewari on Saturday said the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan has strengthened separatist forces in neighbouring Pakistan and the development could have an adverse effect on border areas of Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. “Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) is continuously trying to vitiate peace in India. Drugs and weapons from Pakistan are being dropped in Indian territory through drones. Though our forces have recovered these weapons and drugs in big quantities, some attempts of sending consignments through drones might have been successful,” the former Union minister said at a press conference in Amritsar. Also read: Economy, security: As Baradar arrives in Kabul, Taliban finalise governance planTewari urged the Centre to take steps to check drones from smuggling in weapons and drugs. “I have already written to Union home minister Amit Shah and raised this concern,” the Anandpur Sahib MP said. Says Punjab needs Amarinder’s leadership On chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s performance, he said, “Despite the negative attitude of the Centre and the Covid pandemic, the chief minister managed to keep the economy on track. The Centre did its best to suppress Punjab by stopping funds under the Rural Development Fund and goods and services tax (GST), but such acts could not affect Punjab, thanks to his leadership. Captain Amarinder is a sincere and experienced leader and Punjab needs his leadership in the elections.” On differences between the chief minister and Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, he said, “Both the government and the party will work together. The Congress will again form the government in the state.” Assures justice in Bargari sacrilege case Replying to a query on the Bargari sacrilege case, he said, “The SAD-BJP government had handed over the probe of this case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) that recommended closing it after five years. Capt Amarinder Singh reopened this case and ensured the submission of the chargesheet. Though the probe into police firing incidents was derailed by the mistake of an officer, it has been given to the investigation team. We will get justice.” Speaking on the agitation by sugarcane growers, Tewari said, “The Centre does not declare a minimum support price (MSP) for sugarcane when it should be done like in the case of other crops.” On Covid-19 vaccination in the state, he said, “States ruled by parties in the opposition, are not being supplied vaccines in full quantity, while BJP-ruled states are not facing any shortage.” Earlier, Tewari paid obeisance at Golden Temple and Durgiana Temple besides visiting the Partition Museum. After the visit, he tweeted, “At Partition Museum in Amritsar. A sombre reminder of depravity of humanity. I wish @PMOIndia had spent some time here before announcing #PartitionHorrorsRemembranceDay. Reopening wounds of Partition serves no other interest but to once again accentuate the otherness of others.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/taliban-takeover-could-impact-security-in-border-areas-manish-tewari-101629546128543.html

The COVID crisis is not over yet,” news agency ANI reported.Also read | Amid BJP’s yatra, CM Thackeray expresses concern over political eventsThe comments were in line with the previous remarks Thackeray had made. Earlier on August 18, Thackeray had asked the people to not violate the Covid-19 protocols in place in Maharashtra, in view of the upcoming festivals and celebrations in the state, several news reports showed. He also said that the second wave of infections had come under control in the state and appealed to all political parties to avoid public gatherings and crowds.Meanwhile, the ruling Shiv Sena in Maharashtra has also criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for their Jan Ashirwad Yatra, saying that it would further enable the spread of Covid-19 disease in the state. Maharashtra cabinet minister Aslam Shaikh on Wednesday said that the BJP is inviting Covid-19 infections by organizing such rallies. “By holding this kind of rallies they are doing nothing but inviting people to gather. They need to understand that people currently are badly affected, shopkeepers, small businessman is already struggling, some of the people have lost their jobs too because of the pandemic, and by holding such rallies BJP is inviting the COVID-19 infection. They should refrain from this,” ANI quoted Shaikh as saying, on Wednesday.Another Sena MP, Sanjay Raut, has also said that the rallies by BJP will lead to the third wave of the pandemic. “Jan Ashirwad Yatra will invite the third wave. Jan Ashirwad Yatra is performed when there is no need. It will increase the corona crisis in the state,” Raut said.The BJP, on Monday, flagged off the rallies across 22 states in the country to introduce its newly inducted cabinet ministers to the people. The decision was made after the opposition protests in the Parliament disrupted Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s introduction of his new cabinet in both houses.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dont-endanger-lives-of-citizens-maharashtra-cm-thackeray-appeals-to-political-religious-social-organisations-101629544439327.html
21-08-2021||Delhi||Shops and businesses in Delhi can remain open after 8 pm from Monday||Covid-19 regulations that required shops and businesses in Delhi to close by 8 pm every day would not apply from Monday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Saturday.After a review meeting on Saturday, Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi: "Till now, because of Covid-19, shops and enterprises in Delhi's markets were allowed to open till 8 pm. In the light of a decline in cases, the timing restriction will be removed from Monday. Markets can now follow their usual working hours."Delhi on Saturday recorded 19 Covid-19 cases and a positivity rate of 0.03%. The city recorded an average of 25,000 cases daily in late April when the Covid-19 surge was at its peak and a positivity rate that exceeded 35%.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority imposed a full lockdown in the capital on April 19. As cases started declining, the government began to implement a phased relaxation process from May 31. Markets were allowed to open all days a week from June 14 but with restricted working hours.Over the last one week, officials in the Chief Minister's Office said, Kejriwal held several meetings with trader groups regarding Covid-19 protocols and stressed strict compliance.Brijesh Goyal, chairman of Chamber of Trader and Industry, said: "We welcome the move. The weather is hot and humid now. A large number of customers prefer visiting the markets in the evening and late evening hours. Also, the festive season is ahead. So, the time-related restriction was causing losses to traders, who have already been severely affected because of the pandemic. They were in favour of the restriction to be removed and assured full compliance to masking, distancing, and other Covid-19 guidelines."Lalit Kant, a former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases department at the Indian Council of Medical Research, said: "Going for phased relaxation is a good strategy on part of the government. But they shall have to ensure that the markets are not crowded. Crowds and lack of social distancing can lead to an uptick in cases. But, more than anything, people have to act responsibly in public spaces."Currently, schools, colleges, and education institutes are closed in Delhi, except for special classes for students of Class 10 and 12. There is prohibition on political, cultural, religious, academic, and other gatherings. The maximum number of guests at weddings and funerals is also restricted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/shops-and-businesses-in-delhi-can-remain-open-after-8-pm-from-monday-101629544678366.html

21-08-2021||Mumbai||Only 13% Covid beds in Navi Mumbai occupied||With the daily average of fresh Covid-19 cases in Navi Mumbai going down to 60 in the last 20 days, the bed occupancy too has gone down from 18% to 13%, officials said. Currently 25 out of 60 hospitals in Navi Mumbai do not have even a single Covid patient, resulting in administration shutting down 10 Covid treatment centers, they added.Among the Covid patients currently hospitalised in Navi Mumbai, 32 are on ventilator support, 137 are in the intensive care unit or ICU, 315 are occupying beds with oxygen facility and 566 are occupying normal beds, as per official records. Hospitals currently have around 5,860 Covid beds, including 613 in ICU, 1701 with oxygen support, 21 with ventilator support and 3305 normal ones that are vacant.In the first week of August, around 8% beds at Covid Care Centres (CCC) were occupied, 10% beds at Dedicated Covid Health Centre (DCHC) and 24% beds at Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCH) were occupied. On August 20, those numbers dropped to 5%, 8% and 10% respectively.While Indira Nagar has no active Covid case, Turbhe, Chinchpada, Katripada, Ilthanpada and Nocil Naka slums have around three to four active cases that are on the path of complete recovery, officials said. In each of the 23 Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHC), the number of active Covid cases is below 100.“Special attention towards testing, especially at the UPHCs, wherein the cases are relatively higher, targeted testing, various vaccination drives for special category and super spreaders have collectively resulted in controlling the spread and maintenance of daily covid cases count so far,” municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar said.Municipal health officials said whether reopening of shops and malls will lead to surge in new cases will be known in the coming two weeks.“Due to the restriction to only allow visitors who have taken both the doses of any Covid vaccine, the malls are not crowded. To ensure its compliance our teams are keeping a check,” a health officer said.In the last 20 days, 967 new Covid cases and 42 infection related deaths were reported in Navi Mumbai in comparison to 90,561 Covid patients getting discharged.“Even if the cases are under control and active cases are going down, it does not mean that the danger of Covid is not there anymore. People still need to be vigilant and follow Covid containment norms and also make sure to get both the doses of vaccine,” Bangar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/only-13-covid-beds-in-navi-mumbai-occupied-101629543788406.html

His personal assistant (PA) Dnyaneshwar Pingale, clerk Vijay Shambhulal Chawriya, peon Arvind Kamble, and computer operator Rajendra Shinde.Landge is a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporator from ward number 7 in Bhosari and as chairman of the standing committee, Landge, he is empowered to make decisions about various funds and their utilisation.Meanwhile, the opposition parties, including Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) held a protest against ruling party BJP outside the PCMC office on Friday.The Shiv Sena protest was led by Maval MP Shrirang Barne and other office leaders. The party members appealed to dismiss the BJP rule in the PCMC.Barne met civic body chief Rajesh Patil and asked him to keep a tap on corruption activity during the tender process. Barne also demanded a detailed inquiry into the graft case and stern punishments for the culprits.“There have been many issues of corruption in various tender filing processes in the BJP regime. A group of people are involved in such activity and action should be taken against them,” said Barne.However, BJP leaders came in the support of Landge and termed the incident as a political gimmick to defame the party image ahead of the civic body polls in January next year.Mahesh Landge, BJP president, Pimpri Chinchwad, said, “This is an attempt to defame BJP image by the opposition ahead of the elections.”General body meeting concludes in eight minutesThe online general body meeting of August was concluded in eight minutes which was chaired by Mayor Usha Dhore. In eight minutes, 22 subjects were discussed and cleared during the meeting.The meeting started at 2.05pm and ended at 2:13pm.The opposition leader and party members of the standing committee requested the mayor for discussion, but she did not respond.

21-08-2021||Pune||Narendra Dabholkar murder case: Court hearing adjourned until September 3||The defence counsel for Vikram Bhave, arrested in connection with the murder of rationalist Dr Narendra Dabholkar, founder of Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (MANS), has sought clarification about the forensic report from the director of Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), Gujarat and requested that if at all the report is filed, the same be taken on record before the sessions court here in Pune.On Friday, the court hearing was adjourned until September 3.Defence counsel Advocate Prakash Silsingikar in his written submission before the court stated, “The investigation of the present case is being monitored by Bombay High Court in Cri Writ Petition No. 3512 of 2015.”The High Court in its order dated 20.1.2017 expressed displeasure on the conduct of the investigation by CBI and directed this court as follows.“At this stage, we must also note the fact that the report, now being available for the CBI (the report of the director of FSL, Gujarat), is likely to be placed on the record of the criminal case, and particularly, the sessions case arising out of the murder of Dr Dabholkar. We would expect that when such a report is placed on the file of that case, the learned judge presiding over that court, given the peculiar facts and circumstances and given the sensitive and delicate nature of these investigations, would not disclose any contents of the report straightway, but await further orders and directions from this court. Let, therefore, and if at all the report is filed, the same be taken on record and formally, ” the application stated.Advocate Silsingikar told HT, “We have moved an application and sought direction from the CBI to clarify whether they are relying on the FSL report by the forensic director, Gujarat or not.”“In 2017, during the high court writ petition, they had filed the document in sealed condition and at that time HC directed them not to furnish it in the court unless directed by the high court. This report is important for bail argument and framing of charges. Initially, the court refused and thereafter it directed the public prosecutor to bring the said document if they have,” he said.It is submitted that forensic report is one of the most important documents and should be before the court as well as provided to the accused along with the charge sheet before charges are framed to ensure that the trial is conducted fairly and transparently and therefore, this court be pleased to record that the prosecution does not want to rely on the forensic report referred to in the 20.1.2017 order and in case CBI wants to rely on the same, CBI be directed to procure necessary orders from the Bombay High Court in connection with the order dated 20.1.2017, the application requested.Dr Dabholkar ( 67) was shot dead by two unidentified assailants while he was on a morning walk on the VR Shinde bridge near Omkareshwar temple in Pune on August 20 in 2013.The prosecution and defence lawyers in the murder case are expected to begin their arguments about the framing of charges against the five accused.Of these, three accused have been imprisoned in the case under sections 302 (murder), 120(b) (criminal conspiracy), 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code along with section 3(25) of the Arms Act, including Dr Virendrasinh Sharadchandra Tawade, Sachin Prakashrao Andure and Sharad Bhausaheb Kalaskar. The case also includes sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).The CBI took over the probe from Pune city police in 2014, has till now charge-sheeted five accused, all of them allegedly linked to the rightwing outfit Sanatan Sanstha. These include ENT surgeon Dr Tawade, two alleged assailants Sachin Andure and Sharad Kalaskar, Mumbai-based lawyer Sanjeev Punalekar and his aide Vikram Bhave, who were arrested at different times between 2016 and 2019. Of these, Tawade, Andure and Kalaskar are currently in jail while Punalekar and Bhave are out on bail.“Accused have produced an application in which they have made a request that prosecution should declare whether we are relying on the forensic report of Gujarat. We told the court we have to take instructions from the investigating officer. The court said that this is a primary stage and the arguments had to be advanced for framing of the charges. There were two bail applications pending-one in the high court and the other in sessions court related to Dr Tawade. Court had asked for withdrawal of one of the two applications and then the matter was adjourned for hearing on framing of charge,” special public prosecutor Prakash Suryanvanshi told the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/narendra-dabholkar-murder-case-court-hearing-adjourned-until-september-3-101629543368640.html
21-08-2021||Pune||Pune Startup Mantra: A delivery drill to re-order drug treatments||The old adage, “follow the money”, is perhaps best appropriated in the case of Pune-based biotech startup CyGenica.The company’s product - “technology that is like a nano drilling machine which carries a drug inside a cell in a safe and better way” – is at the very least three years from being on the market.All the current R&D, proof of concept, and product development is happening in a laboratory at the Venture Centre in Pune.So, let’s look at the money first. After all, words like “genome editing”, “engineered protein” and “nano drilling” are not cheap to come by.CyGenica has raised $1.4 million in a seed fund investment round led by global venture capital investor SOSV in June this year. Co-founder Dr Sk Fazlul Haque Krishnan says, “Other investors also participated in the round. It included the VOYAGER Health-Tech fund, David Rowan, founder of Voyagers.io, and angel investors Sharaf Yamani and Sami Mikati.”“After an initial Birac grant, CyGenica received a grant of ₹1.1 crore from Bharat Petroleum under ‘Project Ankur’. We had also received ₹15 lakh from National Award of the Technology Development Board and ₹25 lakh from DST Lockheed Martin research grant. In total, we have raised $2.3 million so far.”Then there is funding from Ireland.Says Dr Nusrat Sanghamitra, cofounder and person behind the entire biotech enterprise, “I received a first tranche of investment, a $100,000 convertible loan note, meaning a short-term debt that converts into equity. After successfully completing the programme, we were selected for the second tranche of a convertible loan note which was $150,000.”The funding received in Ireland is currently being used for operations.That kind of cash backing generally suggests a product that has more than proven there is money to be made, or in CyGenica’s case, a proprietary and disruptive technology which enables safe, targeted, and affordable intercellular drug delivery. In the beginningAs the eldest daughter in her family, Dr Nusrat, in her school days, wanted to become a doctor. She could not make it through in the exams. This “failure” did not deter her from dreaming big. Her father was then diagnosed with cancer. She witnessed her father suffering from the side-effects of his therapy. “I thought if I can’t serve society as a physician, I will try to make a bigger impact by discovering a drug and making it available all over the world. I decided to do a BSc in Chemistry. I dreamt of making a cancer drug, but had no idea how difficult it would be. It is only after years of efforts I am now realising it,” she says.Dr Nusrat was a visiting student in 2001 at the Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer (ACTREC) at the Tata Memorial Centre in Mumbai. She got admission to IIT Bombay, but gave it up and chose the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bengaluru to pursue her PhD. Dr Nusrat says, “I had then started working on new molecules that can be better anti-cancer drugs. The molecules worked very well in the labs, but did not work in animal models. I was disappointed and felt, what is the point in making new molecules if they are toxic too? Since I was not a biology student, I decided to understand how drugs work in the human body.”“I had studied chemistry all along. Since, for most drugs, targets are proteins, I tried to understand what proteins are, what is the structure and how they behave. At that time, I didn’t really get to work on cancer drugs,” she recalls.The eureka momentAfter finishing her PhD from IISc, Dr Nusrat came to the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in 2006. She studied proteins and their structure for two years at TIFR.Says Dr Nusrat: “I was awarded the post-doctoral Marie Curie fellowship at the Leiden Institute of Chemistry in 2008. I worked there for next two years. I wanted to further study how proteins can be functionalised. I met a professor from Kyoto University, Japan. He was looking for someone who was not from the biology background, but wanting to work in cell biology. At that time I knew Chemistry, a bit of biophysics or proteins, but I still didn’t know what exactly happens inside the cell. I accepted the offer and went to the Institute of Integrated Cell and Material Science (iCeMS) at Kyoto University as a post-doctoral research fellow in April 2010. I spent four years there and by sheer serendipity, found a molecule, a protein that goes inside the cell.”“That was my moment. Now I knew what cancer drugs are… I knew how proteins behave… I had a protein that goes inside the cell. I thought I can combine that protein with the existing cancer drug to deliver them effectively into the cell. We found that it was a very extraordinary solution, unlike any other drug delivery system known in that point of time. I wanted to work on that project, but the group in Kyoto was not interested in it. So, I decided come back to India,” she says.Back to IndiaAfter returning to India, Dr Nusrat volunteered to teach in schools and slum children. While doing so, she came across the Biotechnology Ignition Grant (BIG) scheme by the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (Birac). She applied as an individual researcher and got it. Says Nusrat, “The BIG grant in 2016 was an opportunity to prove my hypotheses. Within a year at the KIIT Technology Business Incubator in Bhubaneshwar, I could prove that an engineered protein could go inside the cell. This was a different molecule than that I worked on in Japan, as I could not use the earlier one because of patent issues.”“I patented the new molecule. CyGenica has filed two international patents – one in 2017 and other in 2018. It is in public domain. One patent covers India, US, Europe and China. This year we are filing it in more countries like Canada, Korea and Japan,” she added.Serendipity, the real life storyDr Nusrat’s entrepreneurial journey is filled with disappointment and luck. While pursuing her research, Dr Nusrat had filled a form online one day. A few days later, she received an email inquiring about her work. It was then she realised that she had applied for ‘RebelBio’, a Cork-based life sciences start-up accelerator programme in Ireland, which was being conducted by SOSV, a global venture capital and investment management firm. Dr Nusrat was invited for the programme in April 2017 and her startup was one of 15 selected from the world over. Dr Nusrat said, “I had to go to Cork in Ireland for the residential four-month accelerator programme. We had a full day of lectures, workshops, pitch trainings and along with it, we also had to prove our research at the lab there. After accepting the invite, They had a pre-condition that I should form an Irish company to be eligible for it. Since I had got the Birac grant as an individual researcher, I had not formed a company. In April 2017, we formed an Irish company. Initially it was called Cyca Oncosolutions and was recently renamed CyGenica. I had then realised that in drug discovery and delivery, it was challenging to raise private investment in India. Our Indian ecosystem does not understand this space,” Dr Nusrat explained.Dr Nusrat also got selected for another Irish government programme called “New Frontier”. She stayed for another eight months to complete all three phases of the programme and then returned to India, to her hometown in Bhubaneshwar. Drug delivery and genome editingDr Nusrat clarifies that her startup is not into discovering any new drugs for cancer or genetic diseases. Says Dr Nusrat: “We are focussed only on reducing the dosage of the drug being delivered in order to make it safe and better for patients. We started with our proof-of-concept (POC) to deliver cancer drugs effectively. We could also figure out that the molecule that we engineered was able to deliver not just cancer drugs, but all such genome medicines or therapeutics. We proved we are safely delivering that molecule. In a way it was gene editing and hence, we changed our startup name to Cygenica.”Explaining further, Dr Nusrat says, “Our technology is able to deliver small molecules like cancer drugs as well as big proteins also. We want to establish and position our technology as an enabler for making any kind of therapeutic delivery safe and better. It was found during the 28-day mice-study that our molecule delivery is non-toxic in high dosage events too. That increased our confidence. Since most of our investors are interested in genome editing and gene therapy, we have a 50:50 focus on cancer drug delivery and genome editing work.”Pune over Bengaluru…CyGenica as a company is registered in Odisha. Dr Nusrat and her team were operating from Bhubaneshwar till October 2018. However, as work progressed, they needed advanced equipment on a daily basis, not available at their preferred lab. Dr Nusrat had two choices – move to Bengaluru or Pune. Says Dr Nusrat: “Pune has a bigger talent pool. Our milestones were getting delayed due to lack of access to certain equipment, which were essential, but very expensive for us to purchase. Bengaluru was an option, but it was much more expensive. Since Venture Centre has the equipment we needed within the campus, we decided to move here. We are renting lab space there since 2018. My brother Dr Fazlul also joined as co-founder and director of operations last year (October 2020).”Status of pre-clinical trialsDr Nusrat and Dr Fazlul plan to complete all the pre-clinical trials in the next 18 months. Says Dr Nusrat, “We are in a pre-clinical development stage and a lot of experiments are going on. With new investment coming in, our target is to prove our genome editing technology delivery in stem cells and T-cells which are more difficult to modify. In the next 18 months we want to prove that we are able to edit the genes inside stem cells and T cells. After that it will be validated by a third party. Imperial College and Kings College London would do it for us.”“Along with that, by next year, we want to launch our technology for cancer drug delivery. Drug-wise nothing is approved by the FDA. However, we want to launch it as a ‘research reagent’ and get feedback and testimonials from key opinion leaders in the industry. Some other companies have also developed reagents to deliver edited genes inside the cells in the labs. We believe that our technology will perform better,” explained Dr Nusrat.Future plansSays Dr Fazlul, “The genome editing molecules will help us get strategic partnership with pharma and biotech companies. Our plan is to complete all preclinical trials inhouse and go for specific disease indication with partnerships with bigger companies in future. We will take at least three years to complete the preclinical trials in the lab – for genome editing drug conjugate and positive drug conjugate. Post trials, the mice study will be conducted in collaboration with ACTREC of Tata Memorial Hospital. This will give our strategic partners more confidence.”Investor speak“Dr Nusrat is solving for one of the most valuable problems in therapeutics. Her approach is completely novel, which is a reflection of her interdisciplinary background.” -Sami Mikati, angel investor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-startup-mantra-a-delivery-drill-to-re-order-drug-treatments-101629542528881.html
21-08-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Who let the dogs out||Plentiful rain in the catchment areas of dams and water holes of the Shivaliks have not only provided relief to wild creatures but has rid them of the menace of village dog packs. Sambar fawns were mauled in the dozens when the thirsty deer would make a beeline for the scant water available at the dams until June. Dogs have since retreated to the villages, where they were born, and are maintained by humans via the provision of water, shelter and food. Dogs will again foray to the dams when water levels recede in the hot and arid pre-monsoon months.The question that arises is: how can dogs be labelled as “residents of the forest”, or “a part of nature”, as alleged by urban dog advocacy groups in a bid to rationalise the massacre of wild species? The absence of dogs from the jungle water resources for months at a stretch gives the lie to such contentions. Where and what do they eat, if fawns become inaccessible to dogs during the period when water resources are adequate? The answer is to be found in the villages. Killer dogs fall back upon human support and some are used by farmers to ward off wild animals foraging their crops at night.Killer dog packs are often found mixed with particularly vicious breeds such as pit bulls, terriers, ‘bullys’ etc when they go about killing deer, leaving many carcasses uneaten as they cannot devour as much as they kill wantonly. The fact is dogs are opportunistic predators, like poachers, and wholly subsidised in their hunting off-season by humans.It is time governments and NGOs acknowledge that an exploding population of domesticated dogs poses a virulent threat to wild species. Pragmatic management plans powered by amendments to the laws should be drawn up to pre-empt their “murders” in the muted, victimised wilderness. State bird at dogs’ mercyIn the breeding season, it is not uncommon to come across a fledgling unable to complete its maiden flight from the nest and finding itself stricken on the ground. Traffic can crush it, or roving stray dogs and feral cats kill the fledgling. Traumatised parents are left vocalising their helplessness with impotent alarm calls from a tree or circling over their stranded offspring in utter despair. Anuj Jain, a Sector-18 resident, had just walked out of his house when he came across a group of youngsters trying to unsuccessfully shoo away two dogs from killing a stranded fledgling of the grey hornbill, which is Chandigarh’s state bird. The dogs were salivating at the prospect; the terrorised fledgling looked as if it was begging in vain for mercy from a Taliban-style execution.Initially, Jain was seized by the dilemma: should he rescue the hornbill from the dogs? Was the bird the natural food of the street dogs, otherwise sponsored by breads and biscuits fed by dog advocacy groups and individuals? Jain overcame his dilemma, realising that this was not the case. Along with his brother, Amit, who was out for a morning walk, they chased off the dogs and restored the fledgling to a nearby tree where its parents were anxiously perched. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-who-let-the-dogs-out-101629542407758.html

21-08-2021||Pune||NGOs move HC against PMC’s decision to lease out amenity spaces in Pune city||Eight prominent non-government organisations (NGOs) have approached the Bombay High Court (HC) and challenged the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC’s) decision to lease out the amenity spaces on a long lease.PMC standing committee has given nod for the proposal and claimed that it would help increase PMC’s revenue.Ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had suggested the proposal and Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) which include Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Congress and Shiv Sena opposed it and voted against the proposal.Pune District Co-operative Housing Societies Federation, Kharadi Residents Association, Baner Pashan Link Road Welfare Trust, National Society for Clean Cities, Pashan Area Sabha, Bavdhan Citizens forum, Aundh Vikas Mandal and Association of Ahmednagar Road Citizens Forum have challenged PMC’s decision.Advocate Satya Muley said, “We oppose any proposal of transfer of amenity space reservation land by means of lease or sale to any party and demanded to scrap it. These lands are acquired from private owners for the purpose of public amenities such as open spaces, parks, grounds, sports complexes, gardens, markets, schools and hospitals. If PMC is handing over it on commercial rates how citizens can expect to get amenities at affordable prices.”“The PMC cannot turn away from its responsibility to develop the amenity spaces meant for maintaining and improving quality of life in the city,” he said.The forums that challenged the PMC decision said, “Amenity spaces are the last remaining public spaces in the city. PMC had given the reason of Covid pandemic, encroachments, lack of funds for the decision, these are false reasons as the proposal was introduced before the Covid-19 pandemic.”The citizen’s forum blamed that the city is facing various civic problems. Instead of addressing them and creating facilities on amenity spaces, PMC is handing over them to private parties.Earlier, Congress also warned to move the court and challenged BJP’s decision to lease amenity spaces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ngos-move-hc-against-pmc-s-decision-to-lease-out-amenity-spaces-in-pune-city-101629542228518.html

He was the originator of the era. Once we had telephone sets, now it became handy and compact. From calling to watching a live football match, mobile phones brought the world into our hands. Now BJP cannot change the reality. They may change the names, but it hardly matters. Rajiv Gandhi resides in people's hearts.""Those who have got the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award will remember the present name. Major Dhyan Chand was a great man. I am not against him. But what BJP is doing is dangerous. Will they change the name of the country too? If they have their way, saffron will be hoisted in place of the tricolour. But the country will not accept them," he added.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 6 announced that the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award will now be called the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award.This came a day after the Indian men's hockey team won the Bronze medal after 41 years at the Tokyo Olympic Games 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/if-bjp-has-its-way-saffron-will-be-hoisted-in-place-of-tricolour-cong-leader-101629537615825.html

A person's character can change. Similarly, the Taliban, for now, are terrorists but people and characters change."“When you talk about Valmiki, you will have to talk about his past.

21-08-2021||Patna||Bihar NDA leaders to seek Central nod for 4 hydel power projects at Kaimur Hills||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Member of Parliament (MP) from Sasaram Chhedi Paswan, member of Bihar legislative council (MLC) Santosh Kumar Singh and other local leaders from Bihar’s Kaimur region said they will request Central power and renewable energy minister Raj Kumar Singh to approve four long-pending hydroelectric power projects at Kaimur Hills, estimated to produce 2,570 MW of electricity, when Singh visits Bihar for two days in connection with the party’s Jan Ashrivad Yatra programme.“I had visited all the four sites and worked hard since the 1990s for moving the state government for the construction of hydel projects to change the fate of poor tribal and scheduled caste people on Kaimur hills. It is a good omen that the Union power minister is coming here. The issue will be strongly raised before him by the elected representatives of the region,” MP Paswan said.Paswan was referring to the Bihar State Hydroelectric Power Corporation’s (BHPC) proposal for setting up hydel power pump storage schemes at Sinafdar (345MW), Telhar Kund (400MW), Panchgotia (225MW) on river Suara and Hathiadah-Durgawati (1600MW) on river Durgawati in the hilly region of Kaimur district’s Adhaura block, which has been pending clearance for a long time despite the completion of major legwork including feasibility studies for the project, between year 2000 and 2010, officials aware of the developments said.The preliminary project reports along with clarifications and details sought by the Central agencies were duly furnished by BHPC during this period and the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) also conducted surveys of the four sites and made a pre-feasibility report. Not just that, a team of Japan Bank of International Cooperation- now, renamed as Japan International Cooperation Agency—too, got a project viability assessment done.The study commissioned by JICA found the Hathiadah-Durgawati pump storage scheme to be very attractive and suggested that it is run on a base load of 400MW throughout the year on completion, therefore endorsing the project’s potential to become a pump storage-cum power plant. It also agreed to extend financial assistance to the project, said LP Sinha, retired BHPC managing director (MD), who worked on the project proposals during his tenure.The then principal secretary, energy, Bihar, Rameshwar Singh, wrote on September 29, 2010, to the Union ministry of power highlighting how these environment-friendly and carbon emission-free projects were likely to result in rapid augmentation of power generation, stability of transmission and meeting the state’s power demand, MP Chhedi Paswan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-nda-leaders-to-seek-central-nod-for-4-hydel-power-projects-at-kaimur-hills-101629536828165.html
21-08-2021||Delhi||Floral, funky, festive: Redefining rakhis||Gone are the days when a rakhi was just a thread with a pendant, some pearls or other such basic decorative items. Millennials and Gen-Z now want to include fun elements to spruce up rakhis in their own creative ways, this Rakshabandhan. While some like to gift their siblings a rakhi that explains a particular trait of theirs, others are looking for something more long-lasting to cherish the special bond. So, whether you’re a food buff, a movie lover or a fan of handmade intricate items, markets, both online and offline, are flooded with a variety of choices. Here are some types of rakhis that are now ruling the market. For Rakshabandhan, a number of jewellery brands have come up with several rakhi designs. “We have launched silver rakhis for the first time. Unlike conventional rakhis, these can be treasured for life. Our rakhis can be repurposed as pendants, so they make for a fantastic investment, too,” says Shyamala Ramanan, business head, Mia. Joita Sen, director, marketing and designs, Senco Gold & Diamonds, says they’ve observed that the demand for gold, silver and diamonds has remained strong. “These time-tested assets and investments help people during difficult times. These rakhis can be converted into pendants and bracelets, as per the customer’s wish,” adds Sen. Evil eye rakhis are among the most popular ones, this year, for retailers believe that people want to protect their loved ones from bad vibes and negativity. “We are getting a lot of orders for evil eye rakhis, and there are many patterns and designs in this category. Both shopkeepers and online retailers buy stock from us, and this particular one is in high demand,” says Shyam Mittal from Shyam Rakhi Bhandar, a wholesale shop in Old Delhi which also has on offer a range of trendy rakhis to choose from. “There is a collection for foodies, web show lovers, movie buffs, travellers, doctors and many more,” adds Mittal. The festival is not just limited to brothers, it’s a celebration of the bonds sisters and even sisters-in-law share. “We wanted to design handcrafted rakhis that become a token of memory, love and the timeless bond siblings share. Many cultures within India also believe in using this opportunity to bring sisters-in-law closer. We have come up with a new range of Lumba rakhis with hand-tucked, embellished latkans and boxes that can be shipped directly to your siblings,” says fashion designer Karan Torani, who has launched a range of floral rakhis.Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/floral-funky-festive-redefining-rakhis-101629533768333.html
21-08-2021||Delhi||World Senior citizen’s Day: Taking ageism head on!||There is no age to learn new things in life; it’s all about following your heart and catching up with the opportunity. Today, on World Senior Citizen’s Day, we bring to you stories of hope, courage and positivity that prove that will power is not a number. It’s your faith in yourself that makes you do things that you deemed impossible at some point in your life. Shattering ageist stereotypes, these inspiring individuals prove that it is never too late to live your passion. At 62, he started running and never looked back: Tripat Singh His wife died in 1991 and his whole world came crashing down. Tripat Singh went into depression and shifted to Chandigarh from Delhi. “It so happened that one day, one of my friends pointed out my oversized tummy. It may sound usual but I felt bad. I realised something was wrong with me and decided to start running. It was in college when I loved to be a fitness freak but as life moved, I hardly bothered. From that day when I was 62, till now (76), I didn’t look back. From what started as light jogging in the park turned me to a marathon runner. I have won two gold, one silver and one bronze in 42 km marathons. I have participated and won even the toughest marathons in Shimla and Nanital. Those years turned out to be the most inspiring ones and I also started working out six years back. Before the lockdown, I competed with Mr Punjab once and won with 584 pushups. Everyone was surprised that an old man could defeat a young guy. For me fitness is the way of life. Exercise releases your stress. Fitness has given me a new life and a new perspective. Now I conduct free fitness sessions for all age groups in the morning every day. It is us who decide what life should be all about and not the other way round.” She pumps iron like a pro at 82: Kiran Bai Last year, after a bout of sickness, she was unable to do her daily chores, but now she is completely independent, Kiran Bai’s grandson, fitness trainer Chirag Chordia proudly tells us. Kiran Bai started working out at the age of 82. “We began with used water bottles and a resistance band. She loved the exercises and we kept training. I showed her some exercises with weights. It made her feel she could regain her physical independence and the rest is history!” Kiran Bai picked up pace soon. Her fitness videos went viral as netizens couldn’t stop praising the weightlifting granny. “My initial goal was to get comfortable enough to at least sit down on the floor which I hadn’t done in the last 5-6 years. My grandson trained me in such a way that I started comfortably doing basic exercises such as squats, rows, deadlifts, presses, and split squats. I’m happy that my story is inspiring so many people,” says Bai. Skipping at 73 to make a difference: Rajinder Singh Featured in a book The Unsung Heroes and awarded the Points of Light honour by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Ravinder Singh is an inspiration to many. “I was born in Punjab, Amritsar. My father used to skip and I was taught how to skip at a very young age by him. He was my inspiration. Now, I live in Berkshire in southern England and I used to run several kilometers before the pandemic but when Britain went under lockdown, I was restricted to home and couldn’t find a way to follow my fitness regime. At 73, I turned towards skipping once again and started posting videos to encourage others to be active and healthy. My motive is not just to spread awareness about health and fitness but to raise money for a cause. I have been raising funds for the British National Health Service with the help of my daughter. I am also doing The London Marathon in October and turning 74 in the same month. I wish to inspire others to get fit. I work on the principle of helping people or my country, and I will do so as long as I can.”Dancing since she turned 60: Ravi Bala Sharma Ravi Bala used to teach music in a government school in Delhi and post retirement, she felt lost and empty. She had nothing to do and it was difficult to kill time. “Life turned boring and I went to Mumbai from Delhi and a new journey began. I have studied music my entire life, my father was also a music teacher, but I love to dance. I forget everything when I tap my feet with the musical beats but I never pursued this hobby of mine. Once I shifted to Mumbai, lockdown happened and my kids motivated me to make dance videos. I was confused and nervous but it unfolded so beautifully as if it was always meant to be. I posted my dance video and it went viral. Everyone appreciated it. I made another one on Diljeet Dosanj’s song and it was shared by Bhuvan Bam. That was the turning point of my life. Life can take turns at any stage of life, so we must be open to new possibilities. Now, I get requests from people to perform on their favourite songs. I get fan mails on how I inspire them and these fan mails motivate me too. To sharpen my skills, I even took online dance classes. Now, I got the moves (laughs). To maintain my stamina, I take care of my health and exercise. I have to take several rounds while performing kathak and it’s important to have stamina, so I can’t compromise on workout. Dance has given me a new life, and I would like to tell all the senior people that it’s the best time to rediscover our passion.”A leap of faith at 55: Dinesh MohanWhen he was offered modeling, everyone advised against it. His relatives, friends and extended relatives said that acting and modeling are meant for youngsters. “If you are old, there is hardly any scope. They had doubts about it but I had none. I was very clear from the very beginning and the first time I faced the camera. It felt like home, it was an inner calling for me. After a severe battle of over a decade against depression, I felt at peace, as if I am always meant to be a model and actor. There were challenges but I stood strong. During the depression, I gained so much weight, right from working on my body to mind, I gave my heart and soul to my work. I never looked back in my journey and accepted everything with love. I have worked in Bollywood and Tollywood and at the age of 63, I wish to work in many more movies. I live in Gurugram and despite living in Delhi-NCR, I am never out of work. We have to keep our faith alive to grow in life and age has nothing to do with passion.”Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/world-senior-citizen-s-day-taking-ageism-head-on-101629533114683.html

Senior BJP leaders, including former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Pravin Darekar, were also a part of the rally.Also Read| FIRs against BJP workers for violating Covid norms at Rane’s Mumbai rallySeveral opposition leaders in the state opposed the BJP’s decision to hold a rally at a time when Maharashtra continues to battle the Covid-19 pandemic and is the worst-hit state across the country.And on Friday, a war of words broke out between the Maharashtra government and the BJP over Narayan Rane’s rally. Congress leaders Ashok Chavan and Bhai Jagtap lashed out at the BJP on Friday for disregarding the Covid-19 situation in the state and holding the Yatra.Narayan Rane, in his defence, said on Friday that several other rallies were being carried out in the state during the pandemic but there was no action, adding the Maharashtra government failed in managing the Covid-19 situation.Also Read| Defect of mindset: Rane on Sena workers ‘purifying’ memorial after his visitEchoing his claims, BJP leader Keshav Upadhye called the FIR’s against his party as biased. “Political functions are being organised across the state by all the parties including (ruling) Shiv Sena. A large number of people are gathering in those events too, but no cases are registered against members of the ruling party,” Upadhye told Hindustan Times on Friday and pointed out that the BJP had regularly told its workers attending the Yatra to follow Covid protocols.However, Maharashtra minister Eknath Shinde said on Friday that action would also be taken against Shiv Sena workers or Maharashtra government workers if they hold gatherings during the pandemic. “At a time when there is a threat of a possible third wave of Covid, everyone must follow protocols to prevent the spread of the disease. If Shiv Sena workers or MVA workers hold gatherings, then action is taken against them also,” Shinde told ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/36-firs-filed-so-far-against-bjp-s-jan-ashirwad-yatra-in-mumbai-101629532409535.html

Melvin, who was working as an electrician at a hospital in Kabul, returned home on Wednesday. He was among the lucky few who managed to return immediately after the afghan air space was shut down, leaving hundreds of desperate people stranded.“I have been working in Afghanistan for the past 10 years as an electrician in a hospital. Since I was working at the military hospital, my accommodation was near the airport. So, when the message came that the Indian Air Force is operating [a] flight, I was able to get there on time. We had to wait for two days before we could get on the flight,” Melvin recollected.While Melvin was able to get a direct flight to India operated by the IAF, other Indians who boarded different flights were taken to destinations such as London, Dubai, and Norway, said Melvin. His brother’s was one such case in point as he was taken to Qatar.“The flight took us to Jamnagar base in Gujarat and from there I went to New Delhi and reached my hometown,” he said.Even though the Taliban had entered Kabul, Melvin said his workplace was relatively secure as it was a military hospital. “I didn’t experience any problem apart from the anxiety to return home,” he said.While Melvin was able to make it home, two Christian missionaries from Karnataka are stuck in Afghanistan, said Dakshina Kannada district authorities. Officials said information about Father Jerome Sequera from Mangaluru and Father Robert Rodriguez from Thirthahalli has been passed on to the senior IPS official, appointed nodal officer for coordinating with the Centre to rescue Kannadigas stuck in Afghanistan.Both the individuals were trying to reach Kabul International Airport, said officials.35-year-old Deepak Kumar, another Karnataka resident to have recently returned from Afghanistan, said he evacuated before the rush began at the airport.A resident of Puttur in Dakshina Kannada, Kumar was part of the firefighting crew at the US and NATO army base in Herat for the past six years. Unlike Melvin who returned after Kabul fell, Kumar returned to India on June 22, due to Taliban’s attack to control Herat city.“We worked with Portuguese and British nationals. …when I worked at the military base, rockets launched by the Taliban used to fall right inside the premises,” Kumar said.“I am in touch with locals in Herat city who worked with me. There is a curfew kind of atmosphere there as people stay inside their homes,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/few-kannadigas-exited-afghanistan-in-time-govt-trying-to-bring-back-others-101629521107338.html

21-08-2021||Chandigarh||DSGMC goes to the polls today, 212 candidates in fray for 46 posts||The voting for the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) will be held on Sunday with 212 candidates in the fray in a three-cornered contest. As many as 3.42 lakh eligible Sikh voters will elect 46 members to represent them in the gurdwara body. The contest is between the groups led by outgoing president Manjinder Singh Sirsa of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and former heads Manjit Singh GK and Paramjit Singh Sarna. The campaigning ended on Friday. The voting will take place from 8am to 5pm and the results will be declared on August 25. Both GK and Sirsa are training guns on each other for alleged misappropriation of gurdwara body funds, while Sarna is banking on his “clean record” and as a more credible face. GK, who stepped down as gurdwara body head in November 2018 over allegations of corruption, says the charges were made up at the behest of the SAD leadership. Sirsa also faces similar charges with a look-out notice issued against him. The SAD (Badal) is contesting on all 46 seats, GK’s Jago Party on 41 and Sarna’s SAD (Delhi) on 32 seats and the group led by former Akal Takht jathedar Ranjit Singh on 7 seats. GK, as part of the SAD (Badals) won two consecutive elections in 2013 and 2017. Nine historical gurdwaras in Delhi with an annual budget of ₹110 crore run schools, colleges and hospitals. On July 22, the Delhi high court gave the go-ahead to hold the polls while taking up a petition, after the state government submitted a schedule. Earlier, the polls were scheduled for April 25, but were postponed indefinitely due to surge in Covid cases in the national capital. This will be the ninth elections of the DSGMC since it came to existence via an act of Parliament in 1971. Dhindsa fails to broker peace between GK, Sarna Rajya Sabha MP and SAD (Sanyukt) chief Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa on Wednesday met GK and Sarna persuading them to come on a common platform and contest as one force to oust the Badals-led SAD. “He visited the houses of both the leaders to broker peace, but could not as the seat-sharing arrangement could not be worked out,” said a local Sikh leader||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dsgmc-goes-to-the-polls-today-212-candidates-in-fray-for-46-posts-101629492606054.html
21-08-2021||Chandigarh||Bargari sacrilege: Minister-led govt panel meets parallel Akal Takht jathedar, gives written clarification||The Punjab government committee led by cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa on Friday met Sarbat Khalsa-appointed parallel Akal Takht acting jathedar Dhian Singh Mand to give a written clarification over the Congress regime’s alleged failure to provide justice in the Bargari sacrilege incidents. The panel, which also comprises minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and ruling party MLAs Harminder Singh Gill, Kushaldeep Singh Kikki Dhillon and Kulbir Singh Zira, was constituted by the government to negotiate with the Bargari Insaaf Morcha. They were summoned by Mand to the Takht to clarify on the issue. MLAs Gill and Zira besides local Congress leaders, including party’s district chief Bhagwant Pal Singh Sachar, accompanied minister Bajwa to the Akal Takht on Friday. After the panel declared (in December 2018) that the government had accepted all their demands, the Mand-led morcha announced to end the six-month-long protest at Bargari village of Farikot district where sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib took place. Nearly two-and-a-half years later, Mand accused the government of deceiving them and summoned the panel to the Takht thrice but the committee did not turn up on first two occasions. Minister Bajwa on Friday handed over a sealed letter to Mand who was accompanied by radical Sikh leaders like Jarnail Singh Sakhira. The contents of the letter were not made public. Earlier, refusing to appear before the parallel jathedar publicly at the Akal Takht, the panel had issued an open letter to Mand, putting the ball in the CM’s court. “You are well aware of the fact that we were working as a link between you and the chief minister. Whichever assurances we gave to you were on behalf of the CM. Probing the sacrilege cases is the domain of the state home department which is under the CM’s control,” they had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bargari-sacrilege-minister-led-govt-panel-meets-parallel-akal-takht-jathedar-gives-written-clarification-101629492365875.html

21-08-2021||Chandigarh||HC judge gets e-mail accusing him of ‘undue hurry’ in hearing Saini’s pleas||Justice Arun Kumar Tyagi of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, who was hearing pleas against the arrest of former Punjab director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini in connection with an FIR registered in September 2020 got an email accusing him of “ undue hurry”.The email was received when Justice Tyagi was in the middle of hearing arguments for the second time on Thursday afternoon. Earlier in the day, he had summoned the records pertaining to Saini’s arrest. Justice Tyagi on Thursday ordered the release of Saini from the custody of the Punjab vigilance bureau in the case. The judge, in his order released on Thursday night, said the e-mail was purportedly sent by investigating officer Harvinder Pal Singh, a Punjab Police Service (PPS) officer. Addressed to the chief justice, the sender of the email wanted the case transferred from Justice Tyagi to other bench, claiming that the government’s side was not heard by the judge. However, during the hearing, the counsels of Punjab government and the vigilance bureau feigned ignorance about the email and told the court that neither of the two had authorised it. The mail was sent to chief justice as well as to the bench of justice Tyagi.“This court reserves the right to take appropriate action in respect of the e-mail casting aspersion regarding hurry in hearing of the matter without realising that any habeas corpus petition raises serious issue of unlawful detention which has to be heard on urgent basis,” observed Justice Tyagi who is hearing a 2018 petition of Saini since February last year. A plea from Saini’s wife was ordered to be listed before him on Thursday by another judge as it came to light that he was to take up the 2018 petition the same day. Saini was arrested by the vigilance bureau in a land fraud case on Wednesday evening when he had gone to the bureau office to join investigation on the court’s order in a corruption case. His release was ordered on Thursday midnight by Justice Tyagi after two rounds of hearing. Justice Tyagi dealt with two petitions from Saini’s side — the one filed on August 18 seeking advancing of hearing in a 2018 petition in which the court had directed that he be given one week’s notice in the event of his arrest and the other from his wife who alleged ex-DGP’s illegal detention in violation of the HC orders. She had levelled allegations that VB chief director B K Uppal, was a “stooge” of BIS Chahal, adviser to Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and acted as part of “vendetta” to harass her husband. The bench allowed the habeas corpus petition and held that Saini’s arrest was illegal and it was effected in violation of the protection given by the court on three occasions. The investigating officer was given liberty to arrest Saini after giving a seven-day notice. The government in its defence said the 2018 order giving “blanket bail” could not have been passed by the high court, citing some apex court judgments. It further argued the arrest was made in a case which did not arise out of his service period and that his arrest was not a case of illegal detention. Taking note of the SC observation, the bench said the court has to strike a balance between individual rights of personal freedom and the police’s right of investigation in “an extraordinary case and on the basis of ample material”. The court also took note of “political and personal rivalry” between Amarinder Singh and his predecessor Parkash Singh Badal, saying “findings of political vendetta” between them dates back to the 1990s as were recorded in judicial orders. Saini served as DGP during the SAD-BJP regime and headed the vigilance bureau when corruption cases were registered against Amarinder Singh, the incumbent CM. The court also observed that Saini, as per the VB case, did not receive any bribe from anyone or possess disproportionate assets or had any other financial transaction with the accused in the September 2020 FIR except renting of a Sector-20 house in 2018. The rent agreement was purportedly executed in 2019. It is doubtful that the 2019 agreement was executed to create a defence against attachment of the house for which order was passed in 2021, the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-judge-gets-e-mail-accusing-him-of-undue-hurry-in-hearing-saini-s-pleas-101629491885852.html

21-08-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A decked up rickshaw||Flowers are prettily arranged on the rickshaw’s handlebar, on the back of the passenger seat, as well as on the sides. They are also stuck on the spokes of the wheels.“These flowers never rot,” says rickshaw puller Muhammed Abras. Of course, they don’t—they are of synthetic fabric. The rickshaw’s other decorations include sitaras, giant rakhis with cute silvery hearts tucked into them, plastic jhalars in red and yellow, and also a tiny teddy bear clamped to the handle like a talisman. This morning the lungi-clad Mr Abras is lazily lounging on the passenger’s seat; the rickshaw is parked near a chai shop in a central Delhi market. He looks on amusedly as a wonder-struck passerby starts to take pictures of the rickshaw from different angles. “People often stop to take photos of my rickshaw from their mobiles,” he says, adding that many folks also click selfies beside his carriage.Isn’t the rickshaw dressed up like a dulhan, a bride, he asks. He confesses his own dulhan, wife Jamuni Khatoon, has never seen his “dulhan-jaisi” rickshaw. “She has never been to Delhi,” Mr Abras informs. He goes to briefly meet his family in the village in Bihar after every three-four months. Mr Abras silently makes calculations on his fingers, and says determinedly that “I’d arrived in Delhi two years before Indira’s killing in chaurasi (1984).” He refers to the assassinated prime minister by her first name as if she were still one of our present-day politicians.In his 60s, Mr Abras started decking up his rickshaw only six months ago. The idea came to him suddenly. “I thought that everyone likes a beautiful thing.” Over the course of several weeks, he bought decorative frills from Sadar Bazar and Chawri Bazar. The early reviews were encouraging. “Passengers said my rickshaw looked different from other rickshaws.” He points out that “ladies” would chose him from among other pullers for their trips to the bazaar.Too much attention inevitably brings unforeseen irritants. “Naughty children sometimes pull out a flower, or a heart, or an entire jhalar.” Mr Abrar swiftly replaces the missing portions.Minutes later a customer boards the rickshaw. He looks about in confusion while settling down on the seat. It is impossible to see him clearly amid so much bling—as if he were inside a bride’s palanquin. Mr Abras now starts peddling. The teddy bear on the handle trembles like a clock’s pendulum, but its smile stays in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-decked-up-rickshaw-101629489466172.html

Panic gripped the mini secretariat when Narinderpal Singh, who was carrying a can of kerosene, poured the highly flammable liquid on himself and attempted to immolate himself. Luckily, heavy police force had been deployed outside the mini secretariat and alert cops detained him and a few other LIP workers. Narinderpal said sheer hopelessness that had accrued after years of struggling to get a government job had led him to take the extreme step. “Both my grandfather and father are freedom fighters and my son holds an Industrial Training Institute diploma, but despite tall promises no government has offered us a job.” Clutching resumes of unemployed youths and his grandfather’s credentials, Narinderpal said, “The government is ignoring the families of freedom fighters and appointing MLAs sons to gazette posts, which is unfair.” The Salem Tabri resident was whisked away to the Division Number 5 police station. Sub-inspector Kulbir Singh, in-charge of the Kochar Market police post said, “We deterred Narinderpal from taking such an extreme step. We provided him with a fresh set of clothes and some medical treatment before releasing him.” An insult to injury : LIP leader The protesting LIP leaders had gathered at the mini-secretariat to handover the resumes of at least 400 unemployed persons to the deputy commissioner and protest against the state government’s highly controversial decision. Randhir Singh Sibia, an LIP leader, said, “The state government had come to power on the poll plank that it will provide employment to the youth. Not only has the government failed on the front in the last four-and-a-half years, but to add insult to injury it has appointed sons of Congress MLAs to high posts to appease the said MLAs.”The Congress-led state government had tweaked the rules to provide jobs to the sons of Qadian (Gurdaspur) MLA Fateh Jung Singh Bajwa and Ludhiana north MLA and former minister Rakesh Pandey.Bajwa’s younger son Arjun Partap Singh Bajwa was offered the post of inspector in the Punjab Police, and Pandey’s middle son Bhisham Pandey was offered the job of naib tehsildar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/govt-jobs-to-cong-mlas-sons-protesting-lip-worker-attempts-selfimmolation-101629489546806.html

More than 300 faculty members and students from PAU and its Krishi Vigyan Kendras and farm advisory service centres participated.Jaskarn Singh Mahal, director of extension education, spoke about smart marketing and liaisoning of farmers with industrial houses as an important step to boost farmers’ income as well as sustainable diversification. Bector emphasised the need for value addition in the processing industry through farm-gate processing. He illustrated how the current industrial needs focus on the raw material that is partially processed at the farm level, leaving the secondary processing operations to the industrial houses. “Since it is not viable for industries to invest time, money, and resources for primary processing operations, the rural youth and farmers can engage in these activities.

The authorities in NSW had banned kirpan in schools after a 16-year-old student was stabbed in the back and stomach after a fight broke out at Glenwood High School in May.SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur said the ban was opposed by the Sikh community, including the SGPC. She said that “kakars” (five Sikh articles of faith) are an important and integral part of the lives of baptised Sikhs and the ban on wearing kirpan was intolerable. She said that Sikh leaders and gurdwara committees in Australia were in constant touch with the education department of NSW to resolve the issue. “It is a matter of great pleasure that the education department has allowed Sikh students to wear kirpan in schools.According to new guidelines, the “kirpan” being carried must not be bigger than 8.5 centimetres, with no sharp edges or points, it must be worn under clothing and removed during sports.

The high court had on Thursday night ordered release of Saini in just over 24 hours after he was arrested by the Vigilance Bureau. “In view of the fiasco in Sumedh Singh Saini case, I urge chief minister @capt_amarinder to immediately remove Advocate General, Home Secretary and Chief Director Vigilance, for their professional incompetence,” Randhawa said in a tweet, tagging former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and party’s Punjab chief Navjot Singh Sidhu.

I suggest they should discuss all issues, especially sensitive ones, either with me or on @INCPunjab platform before going public,” the CM said in a tweet posted by his media adviser. Saini was arrested by the Vigilance Bureau when he had gone to its office on Wednesday night to join investigation in a corruption case as directed by the high court. A single bench of Justice Arun Kumar Tyagi pronounced the release order on Thursday night. Saini was released from vigilance custody at 2am on Friday. Randhawa has been critical of the chief minister and the state government over unfulfilled poll promises, particularly the alleged delay in action in the 2015 sacrilege and police firing cases.

Sukhbir also declared Joshi as the party candidate from the Amritsar North assembly seat in the next year’s elections. Joshi was also appointed the senior vice-president of the party.In July, two-time legislator from Amritsar North, Joshi, 57, was expelled from the BJP for six years for his “anti-party” activities. He blamed the BJP state leadership for not giving true feedback to the Centre on the farm laws. He had also been demanding revocation of the three farm laws. Joshi remained legislator from the Amritsar North seat in 2007 and 2012. He faced defeat in the 2017 assembly polls. Besides, former BJP leader Raj Kumar Gupta was announced the party candidate from the Sujanpur seat in Pathankot. Several other BJP leaders also joined the SAD, including former Dasuya MLA Sukhjit Kaur, former Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha state chief Mohit Gupta and ex-deputy mayor of Ludhiana RD Sharma. Speaking on the occasion, Joshi said the SAD-BJP alliance was stitched by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal to remove frictions in the society after dark days of terrorism, which resulted in peace in the state. “I was forced to quit the BJP because it turned a blind eye to the demands of farmers. Our state leaders misled the central leadership.

21-08-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali land fraud: Punjab govt suffered ₹4-crore loss, says VB||A day after the Punjab vigilance bureau probing a land fraud case arrested WorldWide Immigration Consultancy Services (WWICS) director Davinder Sandhu, it has come to light that the state government suffered a loss of around ₹4 crore as the layout plans of two colonies developed by his firm on the Siswan-Kurali road in Mohali were approved fraudulently.Former Punjab police chief Sumedh Singh Saini was the first to be arrested in the case on Wednesday, though he was released on Thursday after orders of the Punjab and Haryana high court.Shakti Sagar Bhatia, who retired as a senior town planner, was arrested on Thursday morning and sent to two-day police remand. Sandhu was held later in the evening, and was produced in court on Friday. He has also been remanded in two-day police custody for further questioning.Ashok Sika, who retired as a deputy director, local bodies, is another accused in the case. He is absconding. It was on September 17, 2020, when the vigilance bureau had registered a case against Sandhu, Sika and Bhatia for cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy besides under the Prevention of Corruption Act. Saini’s name was nominated in the FIR on August 2 this year. The names of Nimratdeep Singh, who is an executive engineer with the public works department, his father Surinderjit Singh Jaspal and their aides Taranjeet Singh Aneja and Mohit Puri were also later nominated in the FIR.The case and role of key playersIn 2009, WWICS developed two residential colonies — Green Meadows-1 and Green Meadows-2 — on 27 acres of land along the Siswan-Kurali road in Mohali. In effect, it was a single colony as there was only one main entrance via Green Meadows-1, and In the layout plan, a rivulet passing between the two colonies was fraudulently shown as a green belt.In this way, the firm paid only ₹1.5 crore fee to the government, instead of ₹5.5 crore that was required to be paid for a single bigger colony, and caused ₹4-crore loss to the state exchequer, said the vigilance bureau.According to the FIR, shamlat land (village common land) measuring around 2 kanal was also illegally occupied to construct the main gate. The company also cut some residential plots on this land, which were later washed away in rains.Deputy superintendent of police (vigilance) Harinder Pal Singh, who is the investigating officer, said Sika and Bhatia are accused of approving the layout plans without any physical checking. He said that during the probe it was also found that Nimratdeep Singh, a well-connected PWD official, reportedly received ₹6 crore as bribe from Sandhu to get the colonies certified. Saini’s name cropped up in the case as Nimratdeep allegedly spent the bribe money on buying a two-kanal house in Sector 20, Chandigarh, where the former top cop started residing as a tenant on October 15, 2018, for a monthly rent of ₹2.50 lakh.The vigilance bureau said after analysing financial transactions between Saini and Nimratdeep’s father, it was found that Saini had transferred ₹6.4 crore into the bank accounts of the father-son duo between August 2018 and August 2020. It has been alleged that the amount was not given in accordance with the rent deed. Nimratdeep had claimed that Saini wanted to buy the house for which they had a verbal agreement. However, as the new facts emerged during the probe, the father-son duo allegedly furnished a copy of a fake sale agreement, executed on October 2, 2019, in order to prevent attachment of the property in a local court. Thereafter, names of the father-son duo along with their two aides were nominated in the land fraud case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-land-fraud-punjab-govt-suffered-4-crore-loss-says-vb-101629487985713.html

Responding to a question, he quipped, “I hope the Congress elects its president by 2024.” Talking about Dharamshala, Thakur said his ambition was not only to build stadiums for sportspersons, but also tourist attractions in the hill state. “At least five lakh people visit Dharamshala cricket stadium every year and number of tourists visiting Dharamshala has also increased after the construction of the stadium,” he added. In reply to a question regarding picking up children from poor families and training them for the Olympics and other international competitions, Thakur said if any such talent during childhood is brought forward by the media, that talent would definitely be picked up and trained appropriately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/need-to-promote-himachal-s-art-culture-of-globally-anurag-thakur-101629487627170.html
21-08-2021||Chandigarh||Schools in Himachal to stay close till August 28||With a surge in Covid cases, the Himachal government has decided to keep the schools in the state closed till August 28. State’s chief secretary Ram Subhag Singh has issued orders to close the schools. However, this order will not apply to residential schools. During holidays, all teaching and non-teaching staffers will be present in educational institutions. The government had earlier notified to keep the schools closed till August 22. Covid cases have started witnessing a rise in Himachal Pradesh. Infections are increasing in rural areas of Chamba district as well as in some other districts. In Chamba alone, more than four dozen children came under the grip of coronavirus after the schools reopened in the past. With the increase in infections, the positivity rate in the state has also started increasing. On the instructions of the government, the health department has chalked out a strategy to deal with the possible third wave. Health experts are anticipating third wave by the September-end. Therefore, the department is making preparations to deal with it. The health department is trying to vaccinate everyone in the age group of 18 and 45 years before the possible third wave. 155 found infected with virusWith 155 fresh Covid cases reported on Friday, Himachal’s infection tally rose to 2,11,432 while the death toll mounted to 3,546 after three patients succumbed to the contagion. Of the new cases, highest 55 were reported in Mandi, 26 in Chamba, 24 in Kangra, 15 each in Bilaspur and Hamirpur, 10 in Shimla, five in Solan, three in Kullu and one each in Lahaul-Spiti and Sirmaur.

21-08-2021||Chandigarh||Thaw in Capt-Sidhu ties, agree to set up strategic policy group||After sparring publicly for weeks, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday agreed to set up a 10-member “strategic policy group” for better coordination between the party and the state government.The chief minister also deputed his ministers to sit at the Punjab Congress Bhawan, the party’s office in Chandigarh, by rotation on Sidhu’s request for interacting with the party cadre and public. The twin decisions, announced after Sidhu met Amarinder at his Siswan farmhouse along with party working president Kuljit Singh Nagra and general secretary (organisation) Pargat Singh, are the first sign of thaw in their strained relations. The meeting between Amarinder and Sidhu – their second in one month – came before Punjab affairs incharge Harish Rawat’s proposed visit to the state next week to mediate between them for unity in the party. The development is being seen in the party circles as “good optics” for the state unit hit by factionalism due to the tussle between the two leaders. Sidhu, who had led an onslaught by several ministers and MLAs against Amarinder, was elevated by the Congress high command as the state unit president last month despite strong opposition from Amarinder. Both Sidhu and Amarinder have been indulging in one-upmanship since, belying the central leadership’s claim that their rift has been resolved, even as the opposition parties, particularly the Shiromani Akali Dal and Aam Aadmi Party, have been trying to get their act together for next year’s assembly elections. The group, constituted for better coordination and to further expedite the implementation of the various government programmes and reform initiatives, will be headed by the chief minister with Sidhu as a member. Local government minister Brahm Mohindra, finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal and social security minister Aruna Chaudhary, four working presidents Kuljit Singh Nagra, Sukhwinder Singh Danny, Sangat Singh Gilzian and Pawan Goel and general secretary (organisation) Pargat Singh will be the other members. Majha brigade missing from panel The Majha brigade – comprising cabinet ministers Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria – has not been included in the panel. The three ministers, once considered close to Amarinder, had turned against him a few months ago, criticising the government for unfulfilled poll promises, and then backed Sidhu in his tussle with the chief minister. The panel will hold weekly meetings, in consultation with other ministers, experts, etc. “It will discuss and review the progress of the various state government initiatives already under implementation, and will also suggest measures to expedite the same,” according to an official release. Ministers to meet Cong cadre at party office Amarinder also directed the ministers to be available at the party office everyday by rotation to meet MLAs, party functionaries and cadre to discuss issues relating to their constituencies and areas and address their grievances. “Have deputed all my cabinet ministers to be present for three hours from 11am to 2pm at @INCPunjab office daily beginning Monday, as per the roster, to interact with public and party cadre,” the chief minister tweeted. According to the roster, one cabinet minister will be present at the state Congress office for three hours daily as per his turn. The decision came after Sidhu wrote a letter to the chief minister. “Highly positive coordination meeting on proposal for roster of ministers to sit at Punjab Congress Bhawan!” the PPCC chief tweeted after the meeting along with a photo with the CM and the ministers’ roster for the next four months. In his letter, Sidhu said: “Punjab Congress workers are the backbone of the party whose persistence, hard work and dedication led us to a sweeping victory in 2017 elections.” “I, along with PCC working presidents and senior state Congress leadership, are of the opinion that there are issues of dire importance to the people of Punjab, which are brought to the notice of PCC on a daily basis,” he wrote, citing their meetings with party leaders and listening to their concerns. Sidhu said these can be effectively resolved if ministers of the state cabinet sit in the Punjab Congress Bhawan. “Ministers spending quality hours in the PCC office for five days a week to hear concerns of party workers, unions and people of Punjab, and taking immediate action will be a great way to discharge their duty,” he said in the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/thaw-in-capt-sidhu-ties-agree-to-set-up-strategic-policy-group-101629487565618.html

21-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: CHB general housing scheme at IT Park delayed||The UT environment department has put on hold the process of environment clearance for the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB)’s self-financing general housing scheme that is coming up at the IT Park.The application for environment clearance was submitted with the state environment impact assessment authority (SEIAA), Chandigarh, in March this year. However, as the CHB failed to submit relevant documents with the applications, the environment department has stalled the process.The CHB last month committed to launch the project within 100 days, as part of the UT adviser’s road map for different departments.Debendra Dalai, director, environment department, and member secretary, SEIAA, said: “We have returned the CHB application for environment clearance, and they have not resubmitted it.”After the CHB resubmits the application with all the requisite documents, the environment appraisal committee will examine the project on its merits. It will then forward it to the SEIAA for final approval.A senior CHB official, who did not wish to be named, said: “The environment department has asked us to submit approved drawings of the project and proof of application for wildlife clearance. The CHB is still to get the project drawings approved by the UT urban planning department.”The drawings for approval of the plan approval committee (PAC) were submitted in January this year. “The department had sought clarifications and made observations on the drawing, which we have resubmitted,” said the official.“Also, an application for providing authenticated drawings depicting the distance of the project site from wildlife sanctuaries and bird sanctuary was submitted to the chief wildlife warden in June this year. It is also under scrutiny,” said the official.728 flats to come up over 16.6 acresThe general housing scheme is planned on the IT Park’s plots 1 and 2, which are spread over 16.6 acres. It comprises 728 dwelling units in different categories: 28 four-bedroom, 448 three-bedroom and 252 two-bedroom flats.A four-bedroom flat is likely to cost nearly ₹2.75 crore, while a three-bedroom flat is expected to cost ₹1.9 crore and a two-bedroom flat could be priced around ₹1.3 crore.A presentation about the scheme was given to UT administrator VP Singh Badnore on July 21, and got an in-principle approval.The administration has given exemption from constructing EWS houses in this pocket, subject to the condition that the CHB constructs EWS houses equal to 15% of the dwelling units at a separate location. These EWS flats are proposed to be constructed at Sector 54, for which land has already been allotted, but encumbrance-free physical possession is yet to be handed over to the housing board.Uncertainty over govt housing project tooThe CHB’s plans for housing for government officials at IT Park has also been marred with delay. Haryana and Punjab had expressed interest in the scheme way back in 2018. The PGIMER also made a similar commitment in 2020. However, they haven’t yet deposited their share of money for the project.Yashpal Garg, chief executive officer, CHB, said: “We have sent multiple reminders to them, but there has been no response. We even made a presentation to the Haryana government officials recently, and are awaiting their response.”While 25% payment (of the total estimated cost) is to be made upfront, the balance is to be paid over three years in six half-yearly instalments with 12% interest. The CHB had offered a tower consisting of 28 flats along with EWS houses at a tentative cost of ₹56.52 Crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-chb-general-housing-scheme-at-it-park-delayed-101629487025897.html
21-08-2021||Mumbai||‘Mumbai’s target population can be vaxxed by 2021-end or start of 2022 depending on stock’||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) can vaccinate the entire target population of Mumbai, around 9,000,000 citizens above the age of 18 years, by the end of the year or start of next year, if there is no shortage of vaccine doses, say civic officials. As of Wednesday, 2,083,893 citizens or 23% of the target population, have been fully vaccinated. Currently, the BMC has the capacity to vaccinate 150,000 citizens per day. Depending on the availability of vaccine doses, the BMC administers above 30,000 shots per day.According to latest figures from August 18, a total of 6,159,896 beneficiaries have been vaccinated with their first dose. Vaccination drive was suspended in the city on August 19 and 20.However, civic authorities say it is not possible to commit to any timeline. A senior civic official said, “We cannot commit to any timeline, as we often face a shortage of doses. Mathematical calculations regarding when we will complete vaccinating the entire target population prove futile. Currently, we have the capacity to vaccinate about 150,000 beneficiaries per day. If Mumbai gets enough doses, we can even scale up this capacity.”Within the past 10 days, Mumbai has faced a shortage of vaccine doses twice. Vaccination at public centres in the city was suspended last Thursday and Friday (August 12 and 13), and again this Thursday and Friday (August 19 and 20). Vaccination will resume in the city on Saturday, as Mumbai received 130,000 doses on Thursday night.In the days immediately following the arrival of fresh vaccine stock in the city, a higher number of beneficiaries are vaccinated in the city, BMC data shows. Vaccine centres had operated at full capacity last Saturday (August 14), and over 150,000 beneficiaries were vaccinated at public vaccine centres in the city, as the BMC had freshly received 170,000 doses.Data shows that over 2,840,000 citizens are yet to receive their first dose, and a total of over 6,916,000 the second dose. While Covaxin requires a gap of 28 days between two doses, Covishield requires a gap of at least 84 days.Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of Maharashtra government’s Covid-19 task force, said, “It is a mathematically logical calculation that Mumbai should be able to vaccinate its remaining citizens by the end of the year or a little later. However, we are not vaccinating enough. Recently, vaccine numbers have gone up comparatively, but we need to increase the pace, especially with the city opening up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-target-population-can-be-vaxxed-by-2021-end-or-start-of-2022-depending-on-stock-101629486848676.html

Thane Nagar police will take Punamia’s custody from Kopri police officers soon.

Tanna, who is in the construction business, claimed that Singh and the other accused extorted crores of rupees by threatening to name him in a fake criminal case. They allegedly also threatened to carry out his encounter if he did not pay the money, alleged Tanna. Punamia was arrested by Marine Drive police in July. On August 7, Kopri police took his custody. He then applied for anticipatory bail for the case registered against him in Thane Nagar police station. An officer from Thane Nagar police station said, “The anticipatory bail has been rejected and we will soon take his custody in the extortion case. We will investigate to establish his role in the case.” The complainant’s lawyer, Sagar Kadam, said, “Punamia was involved in several cash transactions. My client claims that he had given ₹1.5 crore to Punamia after Singh and his team threatened to file a fake case against Jalan.

21-08-2021||Chandigarh||Tricity debate: Guns, gangs and a gory picture||Improve intelligence gathering mechanismsPolice and law-enforcement agencies are well aware of all the gangs operating in the Tricity and neighbouring areas, but they hardly take any steps to nab them. Gangsters roam around freely and go on shooting sprees, either to take revenge against rivals or challenge the police force. The breakdown of law and order in the region and lack of fear in the minds of criminals are the major reasons for gang culture. The Tricity police must improve their intelligence gathering mechanism and provide incentives to informers so as to prevent similar shooting incidents in future.Anil Kumar Yadav, ChandigarhModernise police force to rein in gangsThere is a need to provide youth with the moral and spiritual strength to overcome the feeling of anger and revenge, in these times when there is hardly any job security. Authorities should go for digital verification of vehicles and persons entering the tricity. Further, high definition closed-circuit television cameras should be installed at vulnerable points to monitor traffic and public. Lastly, police force should be modernised with latest equipment to control and investigate crime timely.Col TBS Bedi (retd), MohaliAlert citizens, proactive police can helpA better coordination among the police departments of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula can go a long way in controlling the porous borders that provide an easy escape for gangsters. Besides, tenant verification, particularly in paying guest accommodations, is a must to check anti-social elements using these as safe havens. Police should also keep a strict vigil on all active gang and their members regardless of whether they are in jail or not.Supneet Moyer, ChandigarhA strict, vigilant police can end this reign of terror The gang culture in tricity is quite alarming, and the police and administration must be held accountable for it. The criminals hardly have any fear of law or the consequences of their actions. To end this reign of terror, police need to increase their vigilance, strengthen their source-network, and keep a close watch on all youths known to owe allegiance to gangs operating in the city. Besides, tenant verification must be strictly implemented, and closed-circuit television cameras must be installed at all important spots. More importantly, the men and women in khaki must enforce the law and order strictly and not bow to any political pressure. Amanpreet Kaur Bains, KuraliBad parenting is to blameSpoilt brats of busy, wealthy parents mostly go astray and indulge in criminal activities. University hostels become the breeding grounds for all those who refuse to follow their writ. Political rivalry sometimes leads to formation of gangs, led by those capable of feeding like-minded followers. Youngsters in these gangs are cold-blooded brats who dodge law enforcement officers. Such a gang culture cannot be eliminated overnight. If parents keep an eye on the activities of their children in their formative years, and teach them love, care and forgiveness, we can hope for better future.SC Luthra, ChandigarhOnus is on policePolitics plays its role in creating gang culture to suit its designs to intimidate rivals. Police always act as mute spectators instead of instilling fear of law in their minds. Had the beat system been effective, there would be no scope for any such nefarious activity by any individual or group. Constant vigil on educational campuses, night bars and other such places can help. Society should also single out bad elements and inform the police. Moreover, issuing of arms licensed liberally must be avoided.Raghunath Chhabra, ChandigarhStrict vigil on tricity bordersTricity has become a hub of gangs of Punjab and Haryana and the recent killing of Vicky Middukhera has brought this to the fore. It is quite apparent that gangsters find the tricity to be safe haven as it is easy place to escape after committing crimes. The police of the three cities need to work in tandem and keep a strict vigil on the borders of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula to restrict the movement of gangsters. Vijay Malia, Chandigarh A joint special task force for tricityThe crime rate, including gang wars, in Chandigarh and its periphery areas are on the rise, which is a cause of concern for both police and people. Criminals get away easily after committing heinous crimes. A special task force comprising the senior police officers of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula should be formed to deal with such criminals in a coordinated way. In addition, tenants’ verification and CCTV cameras installation be made compulsory.Subhash Chugh, via emailForm a tricity police coordination committeeA committee headed by an IPS officer and headquartered in Chandigarh should be devised to ensure better coordination amongst the police forces of the three cities. This committee should have a proper working mechanism and coordinate on all fronts related to crime, drugs, gangsters etc. Additionally, this committee should also work on issues related to traffic, by involving traffic personnel as well. Kampreet Gill, ChandigarhDiscourage gun cultureBesides better coordination among the police of the three cities of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula, we need the police to strengthen its informers’ network so as to nab all gangsters and history-sheeters. Cops also need to increase vigilance on ground as well as on social media, which are now being widely used by the gangsters for one-upmanship over their rivals. Gun cultures, especially in popular media such as movies and songs, must be discouraged.Sandeep Rawat, ChandigarhTime for police reformsPunjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi have witnessed gang wars, leaving a trail of blood. Not a new phenomenon. Earlier we had dacoits who operated in their own areas but seldom crossed the path of one another. Now, criminal gangs operate across state borders. Extortion is their common methodology as it an easy route to get rich and powerful. Undoubtedly, most gangs enjoy political and police patronage. Police needs super cops like Ashwani Kumar, KPS Gill and Riberro, who do not succumb to political pressure, to lead the war against these gangs. And no officer must remain posted at the same place beyond a period of three years. Courts also need to carry out serious purposeful introspection. They should under no circumstance grant bail to persons owing allegiance to gang lords. Col SK Aggarwal (Retd), PanchkulaBan songs promoting gun culture, alcohol In order to eliminate gang culture from tricity, there must be total ban on playing songs that promote gun culture and alcohol. This ban should be implemented across the media, including FM Radios, TV channels, internet and discotheques. The honourable Punjab and Haryana high court has already issued directions against playing such songs. Panditrao Dharenavar, ChandigarhWork with citizens to catch the gangstersEvery gang has some political connection which gives them the confidence to operate with impunity. This is also why police are unable to take strict action against them. Cops should not entertain political interference and work towards strengthening the presence in the city. At the outset, special training must be organised for residents to make them aware of the need to thoroughly verify their tenants before renting out a place and also alerting the police when they see anything suspicious. Besides, patrolling must be increased and swift action must be taken against anyone found possessing illegal weapons. Action must also be taken against the sand and liquor mafia, which often fund the activities of such gangs.Subhash Nagpal, ZirakpurNip evil in the budThe gangs and gangsters are not raised in a single day. The general public can barely do much to solve this issue. The onus lies with police and other law-enforcement agencies. Keeping strict tabs on the activities of the gangs can help nip them in the bud.Surinder Paul Wadhwa, MohaliBlacklist politicians who back gangsters Gangs operating in the city have political support that makes them bold to move freely and give threats or take responsibility for murders. Lackadaisical attitude and improper strategy of the police also hinder the action against gang culture. A large chunk of criminals is out on bail and poor decisions by the judiciary give them a chance to carry on with criminal activities again and again. The judiciary needs to restrict bail to such elements. Also, politicians who provide patronage to gangsters must be removed from their positions of power. Arms license should be only be given to persons after proper verification. Jail staff too should stay vigilant against ganglords operating from inside the jail. Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliDon’t let gangsters go scot-freeTricity has become a centre of mafia, gang leaders, suppliers of drugs and addicts. After the heat of Punjab police on these gangs, they have got a safe haven in Chandigarh and nearby areas. They are operating from their own luxurious area, the safe havens of jails, and openly threatening members of other gangs over the social media while cops either remain clueless or act as mute spectators. Shoddy investigations, false witnesses, exchange of money all go on to weaken the case against criminals, ultimately letting them go scot-free. So the cops of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula must join hands and work to wipe out the gang culture before it rises to monstrous proportions.Suresh Verma, ChandigarhTimely action can prevent crimesThere is a need to strengthen the police beat system. Police, in most cases are aware of the operations and modus operandi of gangs, most of who operate in the periphery. Timely action can prevent many a crimes from occurring. Apart from outsmarting the antisocial elements, there is need for greater coordination on part of various policing authorities involved, fast tracking of criminal cases and non-interference of our politicians .DS Banati, MohaliMake the best possible use of technology To eliminate gang culture from tricity, regular patrolling by police officials is a must. Beat box staff must be equipped with the latest gadgets. Most importantly, in this digital era, police must make the best possible use of technology and use modern equipment such as closed-circuit television cameras etc to catch hold of these criminals. Needless to say, better coordination among the police forces of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula will go a long way in ending the gang culture.Vineet Gandhi, ManimajraBring criminals to justice expeditiouslyThe murder of a youth Akali Dal leader in broad daylight is a testimony to the deteriorating law and order situation in the tricity. The incident needs to be probed in an expeditious manner and the perpetrators must be brought to justice so as to instill fear of the law in the minds and the hearts of criminals. In the present milieu, student politics has become increasingly complex and widespread. Often, youth turn to politics in the hopes of minting money and grabbing power. Though dabbling with politics is a risky affair, yet it is well known that many political leaders are an outcome of university system across the world. What is really needed in student politics is mindful learning about democracy, timely tutelage under a political party and rightful conduct at the grassroot level.Surbhi Negi, DhakoliMonitor activities of anti-social elementsThe tricity authorities should form a committee to maintain law and order. A list of gangsters should be prepared and their activities should be monitored. Strict checking should be carried out on the borders of the three cities and proper verification must be carried out of all tenants, vendors and hawkers. Regular checks should also be carried out at hotels, inns etc which often serve a hideout to such criminals.Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, MohaliEducation, equal opportunities for youthPromising lives are cut short due to the prevailing gang culture in the city as well as the country. We, as a society, have barely taken any steps to prevent youths from taking to the path of crime. Providing education opportunities and an equal chance at a good life can stop many of these youths from throwing away their lives to the world of crime. Teachers must be specially trained to identify and reform any problematic behaviour in the young. Ishita Nara, via emailReform and rehabilitate youths in conflict with lawThe only and only way to eliminate the crime is to nip the evil in the bud. Criminals and gangsters do not mushroom overnight. Youngsters drawn towards crime take quite a bit of time to become hardened criminals and their sure-shot tell-tale signs certainly appear during incubation period. Parents and teachers should keep a watch for such tell-tale signs. The SHOs of each police station should keep tabs on the activities of youth in the areas. On the slightest of any anti-social tendencies, steps should be taken to reform them. Repeat of crime on any kind should be taken seriously. Educational institutions should be de-politicised, because politics in educational institutions is a fertile breeding ground for gangsters and criminals.AK Sharma, ChandigarhLaid-back attitude of law enforcement agenciesScant fear of law among criminals and a laid-back law-enforcement system are the main reasons why gang culture is thriving in the tricity. Only the strong political will and non-interference in criminal investigation and prosecution in a professional manner, can stem the rot. The tricity governance badly needs synergy and laws on the lines of the Uttar Pradesh gangsters and anti-social activities (Prevention) Act, 1986. Lalit Bharadwaj, PanchkulaCheck songs promoting violenceFor the past few years, the tricity has been becoming more and more unsafe due to the various gangs operating here. While the root cause of the rise of gang culture is widespread unemployment, poverty and a general lack of law and order, one must also look at the influence that films and songs have on the minds of the young and the impressionable. References to guns and violence have an impact on the minds of youth who go on to become hardened criminals and a threat to the society. Simran Sharma, ChandigarhGrowing feeling of fearRising incidents of gang violence in the City Beautiful cannot be undermined at all. Such incidents make residents feel insecure in the city. The recent death of a political leader in the Tricity is a wake-up call for authorities. Police must take strict and quick action against the guilty. The gang culture needs to be brought to an end by a certain deadline. The police of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula should work together for the purpose. Advanced weapons should be provided to the police and CCTV cameras to catch the criminals. Saikrit Gulati, ChandigarhREADER OF THE WEEK:Channelise youths’ energies in a positive direction The broad daylight murder of Vicky Middukhera has exposed the prevailing gang culture in Tricity. Most of these gangs have thousands of supporters and followers on social media, and their rivalries play out in full public view. Amid high levels of unemployment and the lure of a luxurious lifestyle, youngsters gravitate towards anti-social activities. To put an end to the prevailing gang culture, we must channelise the youths’ energies in the right direction. Sqn Ldr Manjit Singh Johar (retd), Chandigarh WHAT EXPERTS SAY:Instill fear of lawGangs thrive on the fear factor. The only way to deal with them is through an effective law and order mechanism that instills fear in gangsters. Of course, coordination among tricity law enforcement agencies, good operational intelligence, effective and time-bound prosecution leading to conviction and proper prison management are equally important. Suresh Arora, former DGP, Punjab Tenant verificationAll landlords have been instructed to verify the antecedents of their tenants. In case any landlord fails to comply, strict action will be taken against them. We are also coordinating with the Chandigarh and Panchkula police and sharing information on real-time basis to check the activities of the gangs. Their sympathisers are also under being closed monitored. Satinder Singh, SSP, Mohali IdentificationWe have already taken steps to identify people working for gangsters and running extortion rackets. Several gang members are lodged in jails, and we brought them on production warrants to city to identify and break the network. Kuldeep Singh Chahal, SSP, Chandigarh VigilanceBesides forging better coordination between police of different states, we need to strengthen our laws and prosecution system. We also need to check the use of mobile phones in jails and keep tabs on encrypted apps such as Whatsapp and Telegram that are widely used by these anti-social elements to plot their next move. Saurabh Singh, commissioner of police, PanchkulaCrackdown OCCU has adopted a special strategy for gangsters active in the Tricity. We have been working closely with the Chandigarh and Haryana Police and share information with each other. We are putting special focus on cracking down the organised crime network.RN Dhoke, ADGP, Organised Crime Control Unit||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tricity-debates-guns-gangs-and-a-gory-picture-101629485825918.html
21-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai-Delhi route being put on fast track: Western Railway||In a move aimed at reducing the travel time between Mumbai and New Delhi by up to three hours, the Western Railway (WR) has started groundwork on projects to increase speed of its outstation trains.Rajdhani Express, which takes 15 hours, is the fastest train on the Mumbai-Delhi route. The travel time by Rajdhani Express is expected to reduce to 12 hours after increasing its speed to 160 kilometres per hour (kmph) from the current range of 110 -130 kmph, said WR officials.For the purpose, WR is taking up a slew of infrastructure works at the cost of ₹11,188 crore. Expected to be completed by March 2024, the works include strengthening of railway tracks, laying of geogrids and geotextiles on the route, construction of compound walls along the tracks at several places to prevent trespassing and fitting the train with anti-collision system to avoid accidents.Of the 1,474 kms between Mumbai and Delhi, WR will be working on increasing the speed between Mumbai Central and Nagda in Madhya Pradesh (693km), Vadodara and Ahmedabad (95km), Nagda and Mathura (545km). The North Central Railway will work to accelerate speed between Mathura and Palwal, Haryana (82km), while the Northern Railway will work on increasing the speed between Palwal and New Delhi (57km).WR has started work to install a train anti-collision system on railway sections between Virar-Vadodara, Vadodara-Ratlam and up to Nagda stations on the Mumbai- New Delhi route. The anti-collision system provides infrared waves on the railway tracks that activates alarm signals and reduces the speed of a train, and also alerts the loco pilot of any incoming train on the same track that could lead to a train collision.Along with providing a train anti-collision system, WR will be undertaking major strengthening and upgradation activities. Laying of geogrids and geotextiles with deep screening of railway tracks between Churchgate and Virar stations is being undertaken with the help of ballast-cleaning machines. Geogrids and geotextiles are thin fragments of mesh and soil that are put inside the tracks. They reinforce and stabilise the soil and prevent the tracks from damage. The work aims to strengthen and increase the stability of the tracks along with deep screening and cleaning of sleepers placed inside the tracks.The railways has also undertaken the construction of boundary walls alongside the tracks wherein the speed of the outstation trains will be increased.“It is the vision of railways to increase the speed of trains on the Mumbai and New Delhi route. We have started work on the project in full swing. Tendering processes for different works to increase the speed is ongoing,” said Sumit Thakur, chief public relations officer, WR.“All the departments involved are working on issuing tenders and have started on ground work on different railway sections for increasing the speed of the trains. The construction of boundary walls has also started,” said a senior WR official.Passengers’ associations have stated that the increase in speed would help in saving commuting time and the project should be implemented on other routes too. “The speed increase of outstation trains will provide better connectivity between the two cities. There are other routes which are easier to access by road than by rail as train travel takes a lot of time. Increasing speed on other routes should also be focused,” said Subhash Gupta, president, of Rail Yatri Parishad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaidelhi-route-being-put-on-fast-track-western-railway-101629485528100.html
21-08-2021||Other||51-ft bronze statue of Lord Ram to be installed at Shringverpur||PRAYAGRAJ: To make Shringverpur a major tourist destination of the country, the state government has decided to install a 51-feet (15.54 metres) tall statue showing Lord Ram hugging Nishadraj. Shringverpur is a place of pilgrimage on the banks of the Ganga in Prayagraj, about 30 kilometres from the district headquarters. It is believed to be the place where Nishadraj (head of the boatmen’s clan) helped Lord Ram cross the Ganga in his boat while the latter was on his way to 14 years of exile with his wife Sita and younger brother Lakshman as per the holy Hindu text Ramayana. It is said Ram was so overwhelmed that he hugged him. Shringverpur is also one of the major sites on the ambitious Ram Van Gaman Path project of the state government. The State Lalit Kala Akademi, (Department of Culture, UP) has floated a tender for the installation of a 51-feet statue. The sculpture, to showcase ‘Maharaj Nishadraj Bhagwan Shri Ram se gale milte huye’ (Lord Ram hugging Nishadraj) will be made of bronze at an estimated cost of ₹5 crore. Recently, the state government had also announced that a 251- metre statue of Lord Ram would be installed at along the river Saryu in Ayodhya. This would be the tallest statue in the world and show Lord Ram with a bow, arrow and a quiver. The statue at Shringverpur was also recently announced by deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya during the three-day event of Deepotsav at Shringverpur in November 2020. The proposed bronze statue at Shringverpur would also have lead, tin and zinc (each 5%) to provide it strength. The hollow cast metal statue would be 6-7mm thick, without the use of bronze sheet. The statue would also have steel framework to support it. Once the agency is awarded the work, the same would be completed within 110 days from the date of award of the work order, informed district officials aware of the development. The locals have welcomed this move of the state government. “During last year’s fest the deputy CM had made the announcement to install the statue and we feel that the state government has honoured our demand by deciding to install such a magnificent statue at the tapobhumi of saint Shringi”, said Sanjay Tiwari, a local. Every year Shringverpur festival is organised at this place wherein the ghat beside Ganga is decorated with attractive electric lights and diyas are lit all over Ramghat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/51ft-bronze-statue-of-lord-ram-to-be-installed-at-shringverpur-101629485045514.html
21-08-2021||Mumbai||Five districts have 63% of Maharashtra’s total active Covid cases||Five districts — Pune, Solapur, Satara, Sangli and Ahmednagar — have been contributing the highest daily Covid-19 caseload in Maharashtra. Around 63% of the total active cases in the state are in these districts, with Pune topping the list with 12,558 active cases. State health officials said each district has been showing a distinct pattern of the spread. “There is no specific answer to why the numbers are not declining in these five districts,” said Dr Subhash Salunkhe, technical advisor to the state on Covid-19. “There are multiple and varied reasons. What is clear is that there is still a susceptible population in these districts which is getting infected,” he said. According to Salunkhe, districts in Maharashtra are vast and are divided into distinct areas like rural, urban and peri-urban. “The infection is now largely spreading in the rural population. Also, due to relaxations in activities, cases have been on the rise,” he said. Maharashtra has recorded over 6.4 million Covid-19 cases and over 135,500 deaths till date. Currently, the state has 55,454 active cases. Of these, Solapur has 4,580, Satara 6,658, Sangli 5,210 and Ahmednagar has 5,709 active cases. Satara district health officials said rise in home isolation has led to a spurt in positive cases as people do not follow isolation rules and, in turn, infect others in the family and community. According to a report drafted by health officials earlier this week, around 60% of positive patients in the district have been under home isolation and the remaining are in institutional isolation. At least 50 villages in Satara are reporting more than 20 cases every day for the past two weeks. And despite this, strict containment rules are not being implemented. “It has become difficult to get people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said Dr Radhakrishna Pawar, district health officer of Satara. “We have asked all talukas to increase institutional isolation,” he said. Solapur district, on the other hand, has compulsory institutional isolation. The surge in Covid cases has been driven by increasing number of infections among farmers. Most cases are being recorded in three talukas — Pandharpur, Malshiras and Madha. “These talukas have large families of farmers who permanently live in shelters on their farms. We have started getting many positive cases among them,” said Dr Shitalkumar Jadhav, district health officer of Solapur. “Over the past 10 days, we have reduced home isolation to almost zero. But the virus is now infecting rural population,” he said. In Pune, too, a higher number of cases have been recorded from Pune rural. In Ahmednagar and Sangli, health officials observed that people are crowding at events and in marketplaces, leading to continuous rise in cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/five-districts-have-63-of-maharashtra-s-total-active-covid-cases-101629484986740.html

21-08-2021||Delhi||Monsoon breaks pause in Delhi, but IMD says respite short-lived||Marking an end to the 10-day-long dry spell, light rain hit the national capital on Friday.India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said that the city may get another “intense” spell of rain on Saturday. However, it added that the respite may be short-lived as another short dry spell is likely over the last week of August.Delhi last received showers on August 8, recording 15.4 mm rainfall. Weather officials said that for northwest India including Delhi, the monsoon entered a break phase on August 9, which continued till August 19. This was the longest monsoon pause during August since 2017. Unlike July, which received surplus rainfall (507.1 mm), August has so far received only 74.2 mm rainfall. The normal rainfall for August, usually the month when Delhi receives heavy rain, is 247.7 mm.An orange alert has been issued considering a ‘moderate’ spell of rainfall on Saturday that may inundate low-lying areas across the city. “The monsoon trough has reached Delhi and rain activity is likely to intensify on August 21. The good spell is also likely to lead to a significant drop in the mercury. Light rainfall and thunder activity may continue in parts of the city till at least August 23,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.The IMD uses four colour codes: Green means all is well while yellow indicates severely bad weather. It also suggests that the weather could change for the worse, causing disruption in day-to-day activities. Orange alert is issued as a warning for extremely bad weather with the potential of disruption in commute with road and drain closures and interruption of power supply. Red is when extremely bad weather conditions are certainly going to disrupt travel and power and have significant risk to life.According to IMD records, on Friday, the Safdarjung observatory, considered representative of Delhi’s weather, received 11mm rainfall between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm. The Lodhi Road weather station received 13.4 mm rainfall during the same period. Palam weather station recorded 6.4 mm rainfall till 5.30 pm. Ridge and Ayanagar stations received 2 mm and 1 mm rain, respectively.Explaining the reason behind the dry spells this monsoon, Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, Skymet, a private forecaster. said usually every monsoon, four to five weather systems are formed over the Bay of Bengal, which travel to different parts of the country inducing rain. “This season only two significant weather systems have been formed and hence the dry spells in some parts of the country,” he said.The rain cooled the city bringing respite from sultry weather conditions with the maximum temperature being recorded at 32.8 degrees Celsius, a notch below the season’s average and the minimum temperature at 27.3 degrees Celsius, a notch above normal.Humidity levels oscillated between 97% and 70%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/monsoon-breaks-pause-in-delhi-but-imd-says-respite-shortlived-101629484805747.html
21-08-2021||Other||MDU, Rohtak allocates exam centres far from home districts, students hassled||The postgraduate second semester students enrolled through distance education mode at Rohtak’s Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU) have alleged that their examination centres have been allocated nearly 120-200km away from their home districts.The second semester exam for the students enrolled through distance education will start from August 27.Rekha Tanwar, a political science student from Gurugram, said her examination centre is in Sonepat and it is difficult for her to report there at 9am in all five exams.“During first semester, my centre was just 25km from home. I’m worried that I’ll have to spend 2-3 hours in travelling to reach Sonepat. I’m in a dilemma on whether to appear in the exam or not. I don’t know why the university officials have changed my examination centre. Due to officials’ wrong decisions, we have to face the consequences,” she said.Pardeep Kumar, a student from Mahendergarh, was upset that his exam centre is allocated in Meham.“Last time, my centre was allocated in Rohtak city and somehow I managed things. This time, the centre is Meham which is nearly 40km from Rohtak. Instead of allocating my exam centre in my home district or neighbouring district, the MDU officials have shifted it so far. The officials should change the centres of students who have to travel over 100km to take the exam,” he said.A student from Kaithal, not wanting to be named, was worried as her exam centre was allocated in Rohtak.“It’s not possible for me to travel everyday to take the exam. I’m surprised that the university has taken such a decision. I’ll have to bear ₹5,000 for stay and food, if my centre is not changed,” the student added.Student activist Anil Narwal said students will have to bear the brunt of the varsity’s wrong decisions.“If the students’ exam centres are not changed, they will have to spend around six hours in commuting to and fro to centres. It has become a habit of the MDU officials to take such decisions without consultations or review meetings,” he added.MDU director of distance education Nasib Singh Gill said the controller of examination has solved the grievances of many students after Gill appraised him of the situation.“The centres were allocated on the basis of centre choice filed by the students during admission. If some students have made wrong choices, they can approach the controller of examination. We are trying to allocate centres to students that are at a near distance from their homes,” Gill added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mdu-rohtak-allocates-exam-centres-far-from-home-districts-students-hassled-101629484745565.html
21-08-2021||Chandigarh||HC questions Haryana on delay in providing artificial limbs to Panipat boy||The Punjab and Haryana high court has questioned the Haryana government over delay in providing artificial limbs to a Panipat boy who lost both his arms and a leg due to electrocution in 2011.The minor had outgrown the artificial limbs he was using since 2016. He was to be provided new artificial limbs in 2021 for which the Haryana government was to undertake a fresh tender process.During the hearing, the government told court that certain training, etc of the child is required and requisite details of the prosthesis required are not known, so, tenders could not be floated.The HC bench of justice Lisa Gill observed that the state’s stand reflects an indifferent attitude and is prima facie contentious as directions have already been issued on earlier occasions to ensure that the boy does not remain without prosthesis.As per the August 2020 order, tendering process was to be completed in six weeks. But almost a year after the order, no action has been taken so far.As per the govenrment’s own stand, specifications of the artificial limbs were to be finalised one year in advance, amicus curaie, Anil Malhotra had told court.“In the given circumstances, it is not understandable as to why necessary steps have not been taken till date and why the petitioner is without prosthesis for such a long period,” the bench recorded, posting the matter for August 26 and giving a last opportunity to the state to take a decision.In 2013, the HC had awarded compensation to the boy and issued directions to provide him artificial limbs as it was found that he suffered due to negligence of authorities.The matter went up to the Supreme Court, which in 2014 upheld the decision that UHBVN would pay ₹60 lakh to the petitioner.In 2016, myoelectric prostheses worth ₹50 lakh were given to the boy, who was five at the time of the mishap. He had suffered 100% disability after coming in contact with a sagging 11KV transmission line passing over the roof of his house.Myoelectric prostheses are externally powered artificial limbs that one controls with the electrical signals generated naturally by his/her own muscles. However, these prostheses have become redundant now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-questions-haryana-on-delay-in-providing-artificial-limbs-to-panipat-boy-101629484565641.html

We were marching peacefully. It is my right to come to the assembly,” Hooda said.The former CM was supported by party MLAs Geeta Bhukkal and Raghuvir Singh Kadian.“If the leader of Opposition is not allowed to proceed towards the assembly, who would be?” the Congress MLAs said.When Hooda demanded that the matter be inquired by the assembly Speaker, the latter assured of referring the matter to the Committee of Privileges.Earlier, Congress MLAs marched to the Vidhan Sabha protesting against the state government on the issues of paper leaks, atrocities on farmers, rising unemployment, inflation and rising crime graph in the state. The MLAs raised slogans against the BJP-JJP government.Hooda said it is responsibility of the Opposition to raise the voice of public from the streets to the House on issues of public interest.“The state government does not want the Opposition to raise public issues in the House and an attempt was made to stop Congress MLAs marching on foot by putting up barricades far from the assembly,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hooda-complains-of-rough-treatment-by-security-officials-outside-haryana-assembly-101629484508718.html
21-08-2021||Chandigarh||Six amendment Bills introduced in Haryana assembly||The Manohar Lal Khattar-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) coalition government in Haryana introduced six amendment Bills in the Vidhan Sabha on Friday during the first sitting of the monsoon session of the assembly which lasted nearly five hours.The ministers concerned tabled the Bills in the House and discussions on these bills will be held later.The Haryana assembly has put in place a system under which most of the Bills are introduced in the House in advance so that the legislators can study them and hold gripping debates when the Bills are taken up for the discussion in the House.The Bills introduced include the Haryana Management of Civic Amenities and Infrastructure Deficient Municipal Areas (Special Provisions) Amendment Bill, 2021; the Maharishi Balmiki Sanskrit University, Kaithal (Amendment) Bill, 2021; the Haryana Lokayukta (Amendment) Bill 2021; the Haryana Enterprises Promotion (Second Amendment) Bill, 2021; the Pandit Lakhmi Chand State University of Performing and Visual Arts, Rohtak (Amendment) Bill, 2021; and the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Haryana Amendment) Bill 2021.‘Tubewell connection on priority to those opting micro-irrigation’Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said in the assembly that tubewell connections will be issued on priority to farmers adopting micro-irrigation.He said the state government is providing 85% subsidy to set up this system.The CM said even though Haryana is power surplus at present, the state will be judicious while sanctioning tubewell connections, keeping in view that the groundwater level is going down by 1-1.5m every year.While intervening during the discussion on calling attention notice of MLA Varun Chaudhry, Khattar said the groundwater level is continuously going down due to overexploitation of water.Khattar said after the December 27, 2018 announcement to release tubewell connections to those applying till December 31, 2018, thousands of people had applied for tubewell connections within four days.When they were asked to deposit ₹30,000 consent money, of 84,000 people, only 56,000 deposited the said amount. He said priority is to provide tubewell connections to those who have deposited the money.In his calling attention notice, Varun Chaudhry said: “...thousands of farmers...are endlessly waiting for their tube well connections...”In a written reply, state power minister Ranjit Singh said Haryana DISCOMS have released 13,636 new tubewell connections from November 1, 2019 to August 18, 2021.He said the condition of not releasing tubewell connections in notified areas/dark zone has been removed from July 23, 2021. Now, new connections, shifting and extension of load of the existing connections have been permitted in notified areas/dark zones provided that connections up to 35 BHP capacity will be released with mandatory installation of micro-irrigation system where water table is below 100-feet.House pays tributes to soldiers, Milkha Singh, freedom fightersThe Haryana Vidhan Sabha paid tributes to eminent personalities including soldiers, ‘flying Sikh’ Milkha Singh, and freedom fighters, who died after the end of the previous session of the state assembly.Led by the leader of the House and chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, all members observed two-minute silence.Speaker Gian Chand Gupta, deputy CM Dushyant Chautala, and leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda read out the obituary resolutions and paid tributes to the departed souls.Among those remembered included former Haryana governor Jagannath Pahadia; ex-Vidhan Sabha speaker Satbir Singh Kadian; ex-minister Dr Kamla Verma; ex-deputy minister Prof Maha Singh; former ministers of state Rao Dharam Pal and Bahadur Singh; members of Haryana Vidhan Sabha Kitab Singh, Dariyao Singh Rajora, Chaudhary Zile Singh and Puran Singh.The House also paid tributes to corona warriors and others who lost their lives due to Covid-19 pandemic.Rich tributes were also paid to ‘flying Sikh’ Milkha Singh; freedom fighters Amilal (of Kherki, Gurugram), Lalti Ram (of Dubaldhan, Jhajjar), and Prabhati Lal (of Karira, Mahendragarh); soldiers killed in action Lt Amtoj Singh Sidhu (Dabwali), subedar Ajit Singh (Rohtak), naib subedar Vijay Kumar Sharma (Mahendragarh), naib subedar Manoj Kumar (Rewari), SI Bhuru Singh (Panipat), SI Bajrang Kumar (Mahendragarh), havildar Balwan Singh (Bhiwani), havildar Vedprakash (Charkhi Dadri), naik Akash Khatana (Gurugram), naik Kapil Dev (Jind), sepoy Mahender Singh ( Bhiwani), sepoy Biprin Bichwalia (Mahendragarh), sepoy Premchand (Jind), sepoy Dalip Kumar (Rewari), sepoy Inderjeet Singh (Mahendragarh), sepoy Surender Singh (Hisar), sepoy Pawan Singh (Mahendragarh), sepoy Vinod Kumar (Rewari), sepoy Amit (Bhiwani), sepoy Rajnish (Jhajjar), sepoy Umed Singh (Jhajjar), sepoy Rakesh Kumar (Jind), sepoy Jagmahender Singh (Hisar), and commando Sonu Pilania (Charkhi Dadri).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/six-amendment-bills-introduced-in-haryana-assembly-101629484326474.html
21-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt notifies policy to boost oxygen production||The Delhi government has notified a policy to make the city-state self-reliant in the production of medical oxygen to meet any crisis or emergency as the one that arose during April-May when an unprecedented rise in the number of oxygen-dependent Covid-19 patients witnessed city hospitals running out of the life-saving gas.The Medical Oxygen Production Promotion policy, 2021, was approved by the Delhi Cabinet on August 3. Under the policy, private enterprises which will invest in production and storage of medical oxgyen will receive subsidies on aspects such as production, transport, storage capacity and power consumption. They will also get full reimbursements on state GST and stamp duty.The gazette notification was officially issued on Thursday, August 19, said the document, a copy of which HT has seen.The document said, “The ongoing Covid-19 crisis fuelled by new 2021 strain of the virus has put enormous pressure on existing healthcare infrastructure, including medical logistics, in the NCT of Delhi. A large number of Covid-19 patients need oxygen support at hospitals and at homes. This sudden increased demand coupled with negligible oxygen production in the state has necessitated dependence on resources outside Delhi. As the number of patients requiring oxygen support increased in a short span of time, the pressure of supply of medical oxygen to hospitals was significantly strained due to notable delay in movement of oxygen from outside Delhi. Though the present situation is better, a similar crisis may re-occur in future and it is needed to be better equipped to manage such a situation in future.”The notification document said that the objectives of the policy are “to make Delhi self-reliant in terms of medical oxygen production and supply” which the government aims to achieve by encouraging the setting up new manufacturing enterprises and expanding the production capacity of existing ones for “uninterrupted oxygen supply” to hospitals and nursing homes, and “to facilitate storage and transportation of medical oxygen in Delhi”.Delhi witnessed an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases earlier this year, which left the healthcare infrastructure in the city overwhelmed. At its peak, Delhi added a daily average of 25,294 new Covid-19 cases for the week ending April 23. A severe crisis of medical oxygen turned the situation worse. While the Capital’s demand was around 700MT per day, it received between 300 MT – 500 MT for around 10 days even as it witnessed the worst of the wave. In usual times, Delhi’s oxygen consumption on a daily basis is about 250 MT, senior government officials said.Oxygen was sourced to Delhi from plants in several states that include Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Odisha. The distribution task across India was taken over by the central government under laws concerning epidemics. The same period witnessed incessant distress calls from hospitals and individuals and multiple instances of friction involving the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi, the Centre and governments in neighbouring states, mostly over logistics and movement of medical oxygen.The policy notification document said the government has broadly set five targets: Setting up of liquid oxygen (LOX) manufacturing facilities of minimum 50 MT (metric tonnes) capacity up to a total of 100 MT; Setting up of non-captive oxygen generation plants of minimum 10 MT and maximum 50 MT capacity up to a total of 100 MT; Setting up of captive oxygen generation plants of minimum 500 LPM (litres per-minute) capacity at hospitals and nursing homes to cater to their peak demand for medical oxygen up to a total capacity of 200 MT; Setting up of cryogenic tankers of minimum carrying capacity of 10 MT for the exclusive purpose of ferrying liquid medical oxygen up to a total capacity of 500 MT; Setting up of liquid medical oxygen storage tanks of minimum 10 MT capacity up to a total capacity of 1000 MT.The oxygen generation plants will either be pressure swing adsorption plants (PSA) or those using the air separation unit (ASU) technology, said the government.The document said, for liquid oxygen manufacturing plants, non-captive cryogenic plants and PSA plants for hospitals and nursing homes, the applicant will be eligible for a one-time subsidy of ₹20 lakh per metric-tonne capacity; for cryogenic tankers they will be eligible for one-time subsidy of ₹3 lakh per metric-tonne; And there is one-time subsidy of ₹1 lakh per metric-tonne on liquid medical oxygen storage for hospitals, nursing homes and re-fillers.To avail the incentives, liquid oxygen plants have to be commisioned by December 31, 2022, non-captive cryogenic plants by March 31, 2022, PSA plants for hospitals and nursing homes have to be commissioned by December 31, 2021, cryogenic tankers have to be registered in Delhi by December 31, 2021, and liquid storage facilities for hospitals, nursing homes and re-fillers too have to be easy by the end of this year, said the notification document.Power subsidy will be given to liquid oxygen generation plants and non-captive oxygen generation plants (PSA/ASU) at ₹4 per unit consumed in the manufacturing process for the first five years from the date of commencement of commercial production. Full reimbursement of gross SGST will be made to liquid oxygen generation plants and non-captive oxygen generation plants (PSA/ASU) within a month of commissioning of the plant, said the notification document.It also assures full reimbursement on stamp duty paid for purchase of land for medical oxygen generation plant or non-captive oxygen generation plant. Also, if the same enterprise is into producing industrial oxygen, they will not be disqualified. But enterprises availing the incentives have to assure that they operate for at least five years.The document said, the government will invite applications for grant of subsidies and incentives under the policy within 15 days of its notification. If the applications exceed the target capacity, then there will be a lottery to select eligible applicants up to the full target capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-notifies-policy-to-boost-oxygen-production-101629484096570.html
21-08-2021||Lucknow||Seat-sharing formula: Nishad party launches survey with BJP in eastern, central Uttar Pradesh||The Nirbal Indian Shoshit Hamara Aam Dal (Nishad) party has launched a survey, along with its alliance partner the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in various districts of eastern and central Uttar Pradesh.The exercise is meant to identify the seats on which Nishad party nominees will be in a winnable position in the 2022 assembly election due early next year.Nishad party chief Sanjay Nishad said the survey report will be submitted to BJP national president JP Nadda to finalise the seat-sharing formula for the election.The votes of the Nishad community would be decisive in around 160 assembly constituencies in eastern and central UP, the Nishad party has claimed. The party had constituted committees in 70 constituencies for the election, he said.Sanjay Nishad attended a meeting at the residence of Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi on Thursday. BJP national president JP Nadda, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, BJP national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh, BJP state unit president Swatantra Dev Singh and the party’s state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal were present at the meeting to discuss the strategy for the assembly election, expansion of the state cabinet and nomination of four members to the legislative council.After the meeting, Sanjay Nishad said, “I told the BJP leaders that the Nishad party, an alliance partner of the BJP, will field candidates in the assembly election. It was decided that the party will field candidates on the seats where it is in a strong position. Once the survey is over, another meeting will be held in Delhi with senior BJP leaders to finalise the seat-sharing formula.” The entry of Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) led by Bihar animal husbandry minister Mukesh Sahani, Jaalvanshi Morcha led by Gyanendra Nishad, Eklavya Sena run by Umed Singh, husband of bandit-turned politician Phoolan Devi, in the state before the assembly election as well as the overtures of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) to the Nishad party were discussed at the meeting.Sanjay Nishad said, “While a majority of the fringe organisations have no cadre, the Nishad party has a strong organisation in the districts of eastern UP. The party also showed the strength of its support base by winning the Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat in the 2018 by-poll as well as the Sant Kabir Nagar Lok Sabha seat in the 2019 election,” he said. Sanjay Nishad’s son Praveen Nishad had won the Sant Kabir Nagar seat on the BJP ticket.To counter the SP and the BSP, the Nishad party urged the BJP leaders and chief minister Yogi Adityanath to include the Nishad, Majhwar, Kewat and Mallah communities in the list of scheduled castes and give them reservation in government jobs accordingly, the Nishad party chief added.The fishermen’s rights on ponds, lakes and rivers across the state that were withdrawn during the BSP rule should be restored, he said.He also called for withdrawal of the cases lodged against the Nishad community members during agitations.“The BJP leaders assured us that the demands will be fulfilled,” he said. A BJP leader said Sanjay Nishad was likely to be nominated to the legislative council and may also get a berth in the state cabinet in the possible expansion of the Yogi Adityanath ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/seatsharing-formula-nishad-party-launches-survey-with-bjp-in-eastern-central-uttar-pradesh-101629483907816.html
21-08-2021||Noida||Govt construction sites in Ghaziabad under dust pollution scanner||The UP pollution control board (UPPCB) has moved to get government agencies in Ghaziabad, like the public works department (PWD), municipal corporation and the Ghaziabad development authority (GDA), to take up dust mitigation measures at their projects such as highways, long drains and rapid rails, among others.Last year, the UPPCB had tasked private builders to reduce dust pollution at the source in order to control air pollution in the city. Developers were required to register themselves with the board, assess and declares measures they took and even put up CCTV cameras at construction sites to monitor dust pollution.“This year, we have also taken up government agencies that engage contractors for different projects. We have trained them in pollution control measures and have tasked them in passing this on to their contractors. These contractors will have to register with us online by September 30, before the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) comes into effect,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB.Grap is a set of curbs triggered in phases as the air quality deteriorates in the National Capital Region (NCR), which is typical of the October-November period. Ghaziabad is listed among the 16 non-attainment cities in UP due to its high level of air pollution.The official added that the contractor will have to make similar declarations and assessments of their measures and a UPPCB team will inspect the site for compliance.Under the self-declaration process, the firms are required to furnish information on 33 points, which include measures such as application of treated water to mitigate dust generation at site, use of dust suppressants; wind fencing around the site, scaffolding sheets/nets for dust control, pollution control certificate for vehicles used to transport materials, ensuring adequate stack height and acoustic enclosures for diesel generator sets, and installation of cameras with open access to UPPCB, among others.“We will give feedback to the respective government agency. In case of shortcomings, we will issue them directions to comply. If they fail to comply, the erring contractor may face a penalty ranging from ₹50,000 to ₹5 lakh. A repeat violation could result in prosecution and we may ask the government agency to blacklist the firm,” Sharma said.The UPPCB said that their move to control dust at source already had private group housing projects over 20000 square metres.The pollution board in October 2020 conducted a study of different road stretches in Ghaziabad and found 18 different roads which generated high levels of dust pollution.The environmentalists said that measures to control dust pollution have taken a back seat in the city.“Having inventory of all projects is must. The dust/air pollution does not differentiate between a private project and a government project. The step should have been taken long back in wake of high levels of air pollution which the city suffers. Once all projects are taken up in inventory, there should be equitable monitoring and enforcement,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist and a lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/govt-construction-sites-in-ghaziabad-under-dust-pollution-scanner-101629483725934.html
21-08-2021||Noida||Traders rejoice as UP govt lifts curfew on Sundays||The Uttar Pradesh government on Friday announced lifting of Covid curfew imposed on Sundays from August 22. With this, the weekend curfew imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19, since April this year has come to an end. The government had earlier revoked the curfew on Saturdays. Officials said the night curfew will however continue to be in place.Awanish Awasthi, additional chief secretary (home), issued the directions on Friday and stated that all activities will be allowed every day from Sunday between 6am and 10pm with adherence to Covid protocols.Traders in Ghaziabad and GB Nagar cheered the announcement and said businesses that had suffered till now will get a boost with Rakshabandhan and Janmashtami coming up. They said the government should remove the night curfew also.S K Jain, president of the Sector 18 market association and convener of Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) in Delhi-NCR, said removing the weekend curfew has been a long standing demand of the trader community ever since the economy started gradually opening up with the decline in Covid cases.“Sunday is Rakshbandhan. People celebrate this festival and buy gifts and sweets for brothers and sisters. Lifting the curfew will give a significant boost to business,” he said.He said that the weekend restrictions had forced many customers from Gautam Budh Nagar to shop in Delhi markets. “The traders will get full opportunity to do business and the customers will also have the opportunity to make purchases on time even during the holiday,” he said.The decision has come as a pleasant surprise to restaurateurs as well. “Just last week, the government removed restrictions on Saturdays and so we did not expect such a move so soon. However, we welcome it as the last four months have been hard on us. Weekends are important for those in the dining business as it draws most customers,” said Varun Khera, president of National Restaurants Association of India, Noida Chapter.Syed Shameem Anwar, associate director of marketing of Entertainment City, which runs the Great India Place Mall and Gardens Galleria in Sector 38A, said that the decision made retailers and shop owners happy. “With relaxation on Sundays, and movies releasing in theatres, we expect the crowd to increase,” said Anwar.Traders’ association members in Ghaziabad said the night curfew too should be lifted.“Allowing operations only up to 10pm is not good for eateries, restaurants and other food chains. They need more time to serve customers. Nowadays, the number of cases has also declined drastically. The government should ease night curfew at least in districts that have very low cases,” said Pradeep Gupta, convener of Vyapari Ekta Samiti – Indirapuram in Ghaziabad.Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter), also backed the idea. “There is always an option to bring back restrictions once there is any spike in cases. Considering the Covid situation, it is also time to increase the vaccination coverage,” said .The night curfew was first introduced on April 8, while the weekend closure of markets, haats, commercial establishments and offices started from April 16.The Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) has decided to resume the metro rail service on Sunday too. Ritu Maheshwari, NMRC managing director, said this change will be effective from August 22 (Sunday) onwards. “NMRC currently operates from 6am to 10pm from Monday to Saturday. The services on Sundays will begin from 8am till 10pm. The trains will run at an interval of 10 minutes during peak hours (8am to 11am and 5 pm to 8pm) and 15 minutes during at other times from Monday to Friday,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/traders-in-twin-cities-hail-move-as-up-scraps-weekend-closure-of-markets-night-curfew-to-remain-101629483484903.html
21-08-2021||Delhi||AAP says BJP owes ₹2,640 crore to MCDs for not paying for hoardings||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) owe around ₹2,640 crore to the municipal corporations of Delhi (MCDs) on account of using hoarding sites under their jurisdictions without paying, a claim which the latter denied as baseless.“The party did not pay a penny for using MCD’s hoardings. The BJP should present proof if they have paid for the hoardings. The BJP has been using MCD’s paid hoarding sites for free for publicity of its top leaders, including MPs. The MCDs have been robbed off by ₹2,640 crore,” said AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj in a press conference at the party’s head office in central Delhi.He further said, “How did the BJP put up hoardings for free at sites which cost ₹1-2 lakh per year per hoarding?... Every resident is a witness to their scams. We will organise a social media campaign against this. Earnings from the hoardings would have been used to pay the salaries of MCD’s officers, doctors, nurses and frontline workers. The BJP has not paid their salaries for months.”Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor dismissed the allegations. “Mr Saurabh Bhardwaj, by raising the political hoardings issue, has tried to shift focus from today’s burning topic of the CBI inquiry being initiated in Delhi government’s DTC bus purchase scam. People of Delhi are not interested in frivolous issues but want to know the Delhi government’s reply on DTC scam involving purchase of 1,000 buses at higher price,” he said.While the AAP is in charge of the Delhi government, the BJP rules the three municipal corporations. Delhi goes to the municipal polls next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aapsays-bjp-owes-2-640-cr-to-mcds-for-not-paying-for-hoardings-101629483187360.html

After [they pass the] class, they may be given admission in any government school,” Pal said in the circular.A senior official of the education department, requesting anonymity, said, “The order has been issued so that our district education department officials and our heads of schools who are in contact with private schools can consult among one another and collect data on their situation under present circumstances. We will then move forward to ensure that their learning is not disrupted.”According to the Right to Education Act, 25% of seats in entry-level classes — nursery, kindergarten and Class 1 — in all private schools are to be reserved for the EWS/DG category, which includes 3% reservation for children with special needs. These students are entitled to free textbooks, writing material, and uniforms till Class 8, for which the government reimburses a fixed amount to the schools.Till June, the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) had identified at least 2,029 children in the city who lost either one or both of their parents during the Covid-19 pandemic and shared these names with the Women and Child Development department to ensure that the eligible beneficiaries can avail of the government schemes.“Of these, 67 children have lost both their parents whereas 651 children have lost their mother due to Covid and 1,311 have lost their father due to Covid,” DCPCR said in a statement in June.During the fourth wave from March to May, Delhi saw over 13,000 recorded Covid-19 deaths and over 786,000 infections. On May 18, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced ₹50,000 relief for families of people who died of Covid-19, free education, and ₹2,500 per month till the age of 25 for those orphaned because of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/doedirects-officials-to-ensure-education-of-children-who-lost-parents-during-pandemic-101629483187899.html
21-08-2021||Delhi||Gujjar murder case: Gangster plotting to kill jail official held||An alleged Delhi gangster, who was plotting to kill a jail officer to avenge his accomplice Ankit Gujjar’s death inside the Tihar jail, was arrested from outer ring road at Chirag Delhi, said Delhi police on Tuesday.Police said Satender alias Satte, was also trying to arrange an AK-47 rifle to murder a Tihar jail deputy superintendent and avenge the killing of Gujjar, who was lodged in jail number 3 and was found dead on August 4. Delhi police have registered a murder case against the deputy superintendent of the prison but are yet to arrest anyone in the case.Delhi police said they arrested Satte (28) after they came across an audio clip in which two men are heard discussing about arranging an AK-47 rifle. Police said the phone conversation between the two men was widely circulated on social media after which they launched a probe.Satte, police said, is involved in more than 20 criminal cases such as murder, robbery and snatching. He is allegedly a sharpshooter of south Delhi’s Ankit Gujjar - Rohit Chaudhary gang. Gujjar was working with Chaudhary before his arrest in August last year. The two men, according to police, were trying to expand their footprint across Delhi. The gang is accused of crimes such as extortion, contract killings, robbery, land grabbing and snatching.“We identified the people involved in the conversation as Satte alias Satender and his accomplice Ajay Gujjar. In the clip, Satte is asking his accomplice to arrange an AK-47 rifle as he wanted to cause harm to the deputy superintendent. On August 17, we received information about Satender visiting a park near the outer ring road in Chirag Delhi to meet his accomplices. We laid a trap and arrested him from the spot. He was carrying a pistol and six live cartridges. We are questioning him to find his accomplices and the possible threat to any other person’s life, including the jail officer,” said a senior police officer who asked not be named.Satte, who was last arrested in 2019 for the murder of his rival in Saket, came out on interim bail last month. Police said Satte is involved in cases of extorting money from property dealers, gambling operators, bookies and builders.Gujjar (29) was found dead in his cell on the morning of August 4. Until his arrest in August 2020, Gujjar was one of the most wanted persons in western Uttar Pradesh. Police have in the past described Gujjar as a top gangster with at least eight murder cases registered against him. Jail officers, in their statement to police, have said that on August 3, the deputy superintendent and other guards conducted a search inside Gujjar’s cell and found a cell phone and a knife.The officers alleged that Gujjar slapped the deputy superintendent after which the prison guards used “minimum force” to restrain him and put him in a different cell. Gujjar was found dead the following morning. However, Gujjar’s family has accused prison officials of extortion and also submitted a clip, in which Gujjar is purportedly heard telling his sister about the threat to his life, as he was unable to pay the jail officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gujjar-murder-case-gangster-plotting-to-kill-jail-official-held-101629483186844.html

No specific recommendation regarding a Covid-19 vaccine booster dose has been made by the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) or the National expert group on vaccine administration for Covid (NEGVAC). Ajit Pawar, speaking after the weekly Covid review meeting in Pune, also reiterated that in Pune district, priority will be given to those who are due for their second dose of the vaccine. Last week, Cyrus Poonawalla founder of the Serum Institute of India (SII) advocated the need of a booster dose, six months after the second dose. “At the Covid review meet, some pressed for a booster dose, but before we move forward, eligible people in Pune and also in the state should get fully vaccinated. Then we can think of a booster dose. Many still haven’t received the first dose. The state government and I, personally, agree that a booster dose should be given,” said Ajit Pawar. Answering a question in the Rajya Sabha, Dr Bharati Pawar, minister of state for health and family welfare, on July 27, said, “There are some media reports of some countries considering booster doses of Covid-19 vaccine. The NTAGI and NEGVAC are deliberating and considering scientific evidence related to the dose schedule of Covid-19 vaccines. So far, no specific recommendation regarding a Covid-19 vaccine booster dose has been made by NTAGI or NEGVAC.” However, experts feel that in the future booster shots could be recommended in India. Earlier, in an interview with India Science, a channel of the department of science and technology, Dr Priya Abraham, director, National Institute of Virology (NIV) said a booster dose will definitely be recommended in India in future. “Studies on booster doses have been going on overseas and at least seven different vaccines have been tried for a booster dose. Now, WHO has put a stop to it till more countries catch up with vaccinations. This is because there is an alarming vaccine gap between high-income and low-income countries. In the future, recommendations for boosters will definitely come,” said Dr Abraham. Maharashtra is still dealing with a shortage of vaccine stocks. “Experts have stated that the second dose should be administered in the prescribed time limit after the first dose. If this doesn’t happen then the effectiveness of the vaccine may go down. So as of now for Pune, we have decided to prioritise second doses,” said Ajit Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-booster-dose-until-eligible-population-in-pune-fully-vaccinated-ajit-pawar-101629474364434.html
21-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi notifies policy to incentivise medical oxygen production, transportation||The Delhi government has notified the Medical Oxygen Production Promotion Policy 2021 that seeks to incentivise private enterprises to invest in the production, transportation and storage of medical oxygen to make the national capital self-reliant in the production of medical oxygen.The government order, which provides for subsidies and tax reimbursements to private firms, was issued on Thursday. HT has reviewed a copy of the notification. The policy, drafted after Delhi faced a severe crisis of medical oxygen during the fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in April this year, was approved by the Delhi Cabinet on August 3.The notification said the policy was designed to ensure that the city is better equipped to manage the situation if a similar crisis reoccurs.Requests for the subsidy and incentives will, however, need to be made within 15 days from the date of notification. If the government does not get enough applications to set up the targeted oxygen capacity in Delhi - it hasn’t put a number to it - it will reopen the window to apply for the incentives the following month.The government hopes the policy to encourage firms to set up new manufacturing enterprises and expanding the production capacity of existing ones for “uninterrupted oxygen supply” to hospitals and nursing homes and “facilitate storage and transportation of medical oxygen in Delhi”.The policy covers liquid oxygen (LOX) manufacturing facilities of a minimum of 50 MT (metric tonnes) capacity up to a total of 100 MT, non-captive oxygen generation plants of a minimum of 10 MT and a maximum 50 MT capacity up to a total of 100 MT; captive oxygen generation plants of minimum 500 LPM (litres per-minute) capacity at hospitals and nursing homes to cater to their peak demand for medical oxygen up to a total capacity of 200 MT; acquisition of cryogenic tankers of minimum capacity of 10 MT to exclusively ferry liquid medical oxygen up to a total capacity of 500 MT; and to set up of liquid medical oxygen storage tanks of minimum 10 MT capacity up to a total capacity of 1000 MT.The policy covers pressure swing adsorption plants (PSA) as well as those using the air separation unit (ASU) technology.The policy allows for a ₹20 lakh subsidy per metric tonne capacity for liquid oxygen manufacturing plants, non-captive cryogenic plants and PSA plants for hospitals and nursing homes, ₹3 lakh subsidy per metric-tonne capacity of cryogenic tankers; and a one-time subsidy of ₹1 lakh per metric-tonne for liquid medical oxygen storage for hospitals, nursing homes and re-fillers.Private firms hoping to get the financial incentives under the policy would, however, have to adhere to the deadlines for each category.The liquid oxygen plants will have to be commissioned by 31 December 2022 to avail the incentives; non-captive cryogenic plants by 31 March 2022; PSA plants for hospitals and nursing homes have to be commissioned by 31 December 2021, cryogenic tankers have to be registered in Delhi by 31 December 2021 and liquid storage facilities for hospitals, nursing homes and re-fillers have to be in place by the end of this year, said the notification.Establishments that set up the oxygen plants will also get power supply for running the plants at a subsidised rate of ₹4 per unit for the first five years and reimbursement of the gross State GST paid for liquid oxygen generation plants and non-captive oxygen generation plants (PSA/ASU) within a month of the plant’s commissioning.Stamp duty paid for the purchase of land for medical oxygen generation plants or non-captive oxygen generation plants will also be reimbursed. Enterprises that avail the incentives have to ensure that they operate for at least five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-notifies-policy-to-incentivise-medical-oxygen-production-transportation-101629469685876.html

21-08-2021||Chandigarh||National Teacher Award: Jammu teacher took up the cudgels for renovating school building||Two years ago, the government primary school, perched on a hillock in the remote Ikhani village, in Pouni block of Reasi district had no roof and damaged walls. Today, it stands fully restored with a Tricolour proudly fluttering on top of it. The change was brought about by 45-year-old Sanjeev Kumar Sharma, a teacher at the school, who has won the National Teacher Award for his contribution. Now, the school has 70 students—29 girls and 41 boys, largely from Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities. Sharma, who hails from Sungal village in Reasi district, has been teaching at the primary school since July 25, 2019. “Earlier, it would take me five hours to reach the school on bus, but now thanks to a new road, it only takes three hours. The school is located on a hill top in a remote area where rough weather and gusty winds are a common feature, as a result the roof had been blown away and the walls were damaged.” He came to know about the school during a “back to village programme” under which the government was hoping to revive different schools that had been lying in a dilapidated condition. “I decided to contribute my bit,” he said.  The school lies on the Narla axis of the adjoining Rajouri district and falls in the last corner of Reasi district. “When I first visited the school, it was in a shambles. The children were tending to cattle, instead of going to school. I had to convince the villagers to send their children to school. Initially, people were reluctant,” said Sharma. After getting people on board, Sharma started reconstructing and repairing the school building. “The education department provided us ₹25,000 for a facelift of the school building. The villagers also realised that I was working for the betterment of the village and did not charge me for labour,” said Sharma, adding that his child also studies at the same school. “In 2019, only 13 children were studying at the school and then the number rose to 50 last year. This year, 70 children — 29 girls and 41 boys — are pursuing their primary education at the school,” he added. Sharma has also presented papers at the national conferences of the teachers and has many publications in Dogri language to his credit. The former wrestler was also made nodal officer of Reasi district for the Khelo India programme, which was a huge success. Besides focusing on the education of the children, Sharma has been at the forefront of promoting the girl child, and providing them with equal opportunities in academics, sports and vocational training.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nationalteacher-award-jammu-teacher-took-up-the-cudgels-for-renovating-school-building-1629402544903.html
21-08-2021||Chandigarh||National Teacher Award: Ladakh teacher introduced subject-specific classrooms||The out-of-the-box initiative of setting up subject specific classrooms, the brainchild of 42-year-old Muhammad Ali, the acting head teacher at Government Primary School, Karith, in Kargil district of Ladakh has won him the National Teacher Award this year, apart from the appreciation of Sonam Wangchuk, the education reformist. Ali, who holds a masters degree in science, English and education, became a teacher in 2006. He hails from Kanoor, a remote and sparsely inhabited village in Kargil district. “In 2016, I was posted at the Government Middle School, Kharith, where I introduced the concept of subject specific classrooms. We do not have grade-wise classes but subject-specific classes. In orthodox teaching, students sit in their classes and subject teachers come to the class. However, here students go to different classes where they are taught by the respective subject teacher with relevant teaching-learning material (TLM) ,” he said. “It is a method of practical teaching. Carrying TLM to classrooms was not feasible nor was there adequate space in the classroom,” he said. Sonam Wangchuk also visited the school in 2019 and was inspired by the concept of subject-specific classrooms. Ali said, “In our subject-specific classrooms, children will go through their TLM but also see TLM of higher classes. The classes are attractive and it enhances their understanding as well.” “It is a new model in middle level schooling from Class 1 to 8 in India. The pilot project was taken up in 2016 and introduced in 2018,” he added. Ali also got the students involved in making artificial glaciers during winter breaks. “Our initiative came into the limelight in 2018 and the then DC Baseer-ul-Haq also heard of it. He came see the artificial glacier, but he was more impressed by our subject specific classrooms,” said Ali. The school has 10 subject-specific classrooms for science, mathematics, social studies, language, games, ABC Class, 123 Class, Urdu, Library, smart classroom and has 41 students and nine teachers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nationalteacher-award-ladakh-teacher-introduced-subject-specific-classrooms-1629402295798.html
21-08-2021||Chandigarh||National Teacher Award: HP teacher got land issue settled, home-schooled students||Kamal Kishor Sharma, the principal of Government Senior Secondary School, Kalhog, in Solan district, will be awarded the National Teacher Award on September 5. Sharma played a key role in getting the land, on which the school stands, transferred in the name of the education department. When Sharma joined the Kalhog School in 2019, its building was in a shambles. When he went through the revenue records, he learnt that the land was still registered in the name of 15 villagers and a budget for the new building could not be sanctioned till the land was transferred to the education department. Initially, he secured ₹12 lakh from the deputy commissioner for repair work. After the Covid outbreak, he was deputed at a quarantine centre at Sadhupul, but he took out time from his schedule and held door-to-door meetings with the villagers who owned the land and convinced them to get it registered in the name of the education department. He brought all the landowners to the SDM office in Kandaghat and the three bighas of land was finally registered in the name of education department, paving way for a new school building, work on which would start soon. Upon realising that equipment worth ₹12 lakh for the Atal Tinkering Lab was gathering dust at the Kalhog School due to lack of space, Sharma collected ₹60,000 from the staff and villagers and made room for the lab. During the lockdown, Sharma and his team taught the children by going from door-to-door. A resident of Barthin village in Bilaspur district, Kishor joined the education department in 1988 as a trained graduate teacher (TGT). The mathematics teacher was awarded a state award in 2015. Kishor said whatever he has done would not have been possible without the cooperation of staff and the villagers and the support of his family. “I am grateful to the government for acknowledging our efforts,” he said, adding that the award would definitely motivate him and other teachers to do better. “My effort is to facilitate students in best possible way not only in terms of providing infrastructure but also improving the education standard,” said Kishor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nationalteacher-award-hp-teacher-got-land-issue-settled-home-schooled-students-1629401703991.html
21-08-2021||Lucknow||Yogi, other UP BJP leaders meet Amit Shah, Nadda in Delhi||The suspense over the naming of four MLC picks and possible expansion of the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh is likely to be over after Thursday evening’s consultation that the chief minister had with Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi.The presence of UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal at Adityanath’s meeting further hinted towards the possibility.“The suspense would now surely be over. Which way the decision would go isn’t known but now the suspense would soon be over for sure,” a BJP leader said.BJP president JP Nadda was also present during the meeting at Shah’s official residence.Many, including those within the BJP, have linked the delay in announcing the MLC picks to the views within the party not just over MLC names, but also over the utility of going in for a much-anticipated expansion of the Yogi Adityanath government. One of the claimants for a MLC berth, as well as minister’s post, is Nishad party leader Sanjay Nishad, who had recently met Shah and BJP chief JP Nadda in Delhi.The buzz is some of the MLC picks could also become ministers in the Adityanath government which has about seven vacancies. However, party leaders cautioned that until an official announcement was made, nothing was sure. One party leader said with elections a little over six months’ away, the constitutional provision of becoming a member of either house of the state legislature after becoming a minister may not matter.“So, in a way one can be made a minister even without being made an MLC,” a party leader said.“A discussion in this regard was held in the presence of BJP chief JP Nadda as well but as of now, nothing is known beyond it. I have a hunch that the expansion is happening. I am saying expansion, because the likelihood of any ministers being axed so close to the elections doesn’t seem likely,” a BJP leader said.Four names are doing the rounds as likely candidates for MLCs. They include former Union minister and Congress heavyweight Jitin Prasada, who recently switched loyalties to the BJP. The name of former UP BJP chief Laxmikant Bajpai is also being discussed.“Both are Brahmin leaders and if one is made MLC, the other would surely contest the 2022 UP polls. I guess the dilemma could be on whether to make Prasada an MLC or get him to contest the 2022 UP polls,” another BJP leader said. Sanjay Nishad of the Nishad party is another prime candidate for the MLC’s post.“There is also a woman and a party functionary in contention,” a BJP leader said.Yet another BJP leader said that with several Opposition leaders in touch, the party could well be mulling accommodating a big Opposition name as MLC.“In any case, we are expecting the names to be declared anytime now. Various discussions have been held and a final decision has been reached and I guess should be made public in a couple of days,” the BJP leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-adityanath-other-uttar-pradesh-bjp-leaders-meet-amit-shah-in-delhi-1629401279917.html
21-08-2021||Chandigarh||Swimming against the tide, Bilques Mir finds her calling in water sports||An Olympic medal for India in water sports. That’s 33-year-old Bilques Mir’s aim while she oversees the training of youngsters as director of the Srinagar-based Water Sports Centre of Jammu and Kashmir Sports Council. “We can increase our medal tally at the Olympics by focusing on water sports. I couldn’t qualify but am determined to see a youngster from J&K on the podium in 2024,” says the first woman to represent India at the kayaking and canoeing world cup meet in Hungary in 2009. She reached the semi-final at the meet in which 110 countries participated and was named outstanding sportsperson of the year before she underwent training to become a coach. She has been training youngsters in J&K since 2014. “So far, I’ve trained 300 boys and girls. We have won 82 medals of which 50% are by girls,” says Bilques, the second of three daughters of businessman Bashir Ahmad Mir and homemaker Hameeda Bano. “Till a decade ago, we had limited resources but in the past two years, the government has given priority to water sports and developed infrastructure. Our centre is now among the country’s top set-ups,” she says. At present, Bilques is on the coaching panel of the India team and is also chairperson of Indian Kayaking and Canoeing Federation. Besides coaching the Indian team, she judged the 18th African Games in Mozambique in 2011 and Asian Games in Jakarta in 2018. Staying afloat to cruising ahead But her journey has been one of swimming against the tide. Bilques battled societal prejudice and even depression to stay the course. “In Kashmir, it’s not easy. A girl has to prove herself at every step. When I started running, people, including relatives, criticised me but had I given up, I would’ve been nowhere. My mother gave me strength,” she says. The more opposition she faced, the stronger her resolve became. “I was in Class 6 when I started swimming. Nobody at home was interested in sports. We are three sisters and I sensed quite early how society considers girls weaker. Many mistook me to be a boy because I had short hair and wouldn’t wear earrings. When relatives pitied my parents for not having a son, I decided to prove that a daughter is not less in any way,” she says. Taking a deep dive to emerge winnerShe opted for water sports because it was challenging. “Fighting with water is unique. This dream did not come true so easily, it was full of struggles. I suffered depression because society did not support me when I needed it the most. I was at the peak when I sunk into depression. Thankfully, I overcame the tough patch with my family’s help and stayed the course,” she says. Her message for society is to encourage girls. “Society plays a big role in a woman’s success. If my mother had not encouraged me, I wouldn’t have been here,” she says. “Women’s empowerment doesn’t mean that a woman is earning; it means how much role she has in decision making at home,” Bilques adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/swimming-against-the-tide-bilques-mir-finds-her-calling-in-water-sports-101629389755710.html

About four to five white flags of what the Taliban call the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan were found atop Jamia Hafsa madrassa, reported Dawn. The local administration and police said the flags were spotted atop the madrassa after prayers but were removed immediately.“The flags were spotted after Zuhr prayers and shortly the capital administration and police were informed about it,” Dawn quoted the police as saying.Pakistan has been long accused of covertly supporting the Taliban militarily, financially, and with intelligence, which Islamabad has repeatedly denied. After the Taliban intensified offensive against the Afghan defence forces, reports emerged that fighters from Pakistan crossed over the border to support the group. Following the reports of flags atop the madrassa in Islamabad, the office of district administration, headed by Muhammed Hamza Shafqaat, said they were removed immediately.

The risk, it added, also existed when the England football team played overseas. “This risk arose not just from individuals attending the event itself, but included activities undertaken during travel and associated social activities,” the study, a pre-print version of which was published on Friday, noted.Data analysed through contact tracing also found that the Euro 2020 final between England and Italy was a “superspreader” event due to the level of Covid-19 infection found in or around London’s Wembley Stadium on the day. PHE said 2,295 people were likely to have been infectious, with a further 3,404 people potentially acquiring infection at the July 11 match.Also, US weekly infections exceeded 1 million on Friday, apparently for the first time since last winter, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/9000-infections-in-uk-linked-to-euro-2020-event-data-101629567165868.html

Only a few private telecommunication companies have been operating in the past few days.“I went to the office this morning, but the Taliban who were at the gate told us they have not received any orders to reopen government offices,” said Hamdullah, a government employee. “They told us to watch TV or listen to the radio for an announcement about when to resume work.”Most roads in the capital were largely deserted save for Taliban checkpoints and patrolling militants.

21-08-2021||World||'It's all lies': Taliban's PR offensive falters as videos of beatings emerge||In the last few days, TV crews from Afghanistan's Al-Emarah Studio, which produces pro-Taliban multimedia content, have been out on the streets of Kabul speaking to residents with reassuring messages about life returning to normal."How confident are you?" asked an interviewer with a Al-Emarah microphone in the city centre. "100%," came the reply. "Security is good, there are no thieves, we are very happy."The message is in sharp contrast to the chaos in parts of Kabul since the Islamist militants swept in last Sunday after a lightning conquest of Afghanistan.Thousands of people have swarmed around the airport, desperate to escape amid fears of reprisals by the insurgents and harsh Islamic law now that they are back in power.It has presented one of the toughest tests yet for the movement's communications strategy, which has grown into a sophisticated operation in recent years and yet is struggling to calm widespread panic.The Al-Emarah interviews were a tiny step towards trying to win back control of the message.For the moment, Al-Emarah websites in five different languages have been difficult to access or apparently offline from Friday, for reasons which remain unclear. The clips could be seen on social media accounts, however.On Saturday, several Taliban spokesmen took to television studios to reassure residents that the streets were safe. On the same day, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the top Taliban political leader in Afghanistan, arrived in Kabul to set up a police force.Also Read | ‘Not a single euro’: EU talks tough on Taliban’s promise of peace, women rights'IT'S ALL LIES'Getting their message across has proved harder since the Taliban conquered Afghanistan than it was when they were fighting an insurgency against foreign and U.S.-backed local armed forces.Over the years, it has often been a step ahead of the government, getting its message out with a mix of multi-lingual social media accounts, videos, photos and responsive, well-prepared spokesmen equipped with ready answers to reporters' questions.While Facebook and YouTube have banned the group, it has an active presence on Twitter and dozens of social media accounts either directly linked to the movement or which stick close to its message have sprung up.Many Afghans have treated those messages with disdain. The group has been blamed for thousands of civilian deaths in gun attacks and suicide bombings over the last 20 years, deaths it said were justified in its war against invaders.And with growing turmoil in Kabul and some other cities, the movement can no longer fall back on accusations of abuse and wrongdoing by the Kabul government and its international allies.The Taliban have tried to reassure both Afghans and the international community that they will respect people's rights and their forces will not exact revenge on members of the government and security forces.The news conference held by the Taliban's main spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid on Tuesday put a public face on the movement's communications operation for the first time.But social media feeds of beatings or shaky video of people being dragged from cars and houses have challenged the Taliban's narrative, sowing fear among a population still in shock from the sudden collapse of the government.Many of the accounts of abuse cannot be verified, but Taliban officials acknowledge the widespread fears.A senior official told Reuters he had heard of some abuses against civilians, but promised that any problems caused by people in the movement would be investigated.In a tweet on Saturday, Mujahid said the Taliban were setting up a three-member commission to handle problems encountered by the media.With smartphones as common in Kabul as anywhere else in the world and a youthful population that has grown up with the internet, the Taliban's communications strategy will likely keep evolving.But unless they can restore order to the streets and get people back to work, messaging alone is unlikely to be enough."I don't believe what they say at all, it's all lies. Nobody trusts what they say," said one Kabul resident, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/its-all-lies-taliban-s-pr-offensive-falters-as-videos-of-beatings-emerge-101629556589895.html
21-08-2021||World||‘Committed to Afghanistan; will work with Taliban if necessary’: UK PM Johnson||As Taliban consistently try to present a reformed image and assure the international community that no threat whatsoever can be expected from them, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday said that they will work with the Islamist extremist group “if necessary.”Addressing the media after an emergency Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms (COBRA) meeting that focused on the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan, Johnson said, “What I want to assure people is that our political and diplomatic efforts to find a solution for Afghanistan, working with the Taliban, of course, if necessary, will go on and our commitment to Afghanistan is lasting.”The UK PM said that the situation regarding the evacuation of British nationals and diplomats from Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport is getting “slightly better” and reaching “stabilisation.”“Yesterday [Thursday], we were able to get out about 1,000 people and today [Friday] another 1,000 people,” Johnson said, adding that those arriving in the UK are not only British nationals but also Afghans coming under the Afghanistan Resettlement and Assistance Programme (ARAP).Referring to the Afghan citizens, Johnson said that these people are interpreters and others to whom the UK owes “debts of gratitude and honour.”Although Johnson said that the operation to get UK citizens homes and evacuate Afghan nationals as well is “becoming faster,” he is not going to “pretend that it’s easy.” “The logistical challenges are formidable and they are doing an outstanding job in very difficult circumstances,” the UK PM pointed out.The UK on Tuesday announced the ARAP that permits Afghan nationals to reside in the country over a ‘long term’ period. According to the scheme, as many as 5,000 Afghan citizens will be given refuge in the first year itself, UK home secretary Priti Patel was quoted as saying by BBC News. The scheme allows Afghans, who have worked for the UK in Afghanistan, to enter Great Britain.Meanwhile, The Guardian reported that women, children and religious minorities will be prioritised for the ARAP that allows Afghan citizens to resettle in the UK over a period of five years.The Johnson-led government has also announced 5 million pounds for local councils in England, Wales and Scotland offering to house Afghans who left their war-torn country and have arrived in the UK under the ARAP.During the COBRA meeting, Johnson also defended his foreign secretary Dominic Raab, who has come under fire over missing a phone call from his Afghan counterpart Hanif Atmar in the now ousted Ashraf Ghani-led government in Afghanistan. “I can tell you that the whole of the government has been working virtually round the clock, hitting the phones, to do what we can to sort it out; to deal with a situation that has been long in gestation and to make sure that we get as many people back as possible.”According to reports, Raab’s office was asked to call Atmar to request him for aiding in the evacuation of local interpreters who had helped UK officials and the military during the course of 20 years.Also Read | UK foreign minister failed to make a phone call to Afghan counterpart. Now demands of resignationHowever, Raab – on a holiday in Crete in Greece - reportedly never called Atmar, thereby igniting severe criticism from the opposition parties who have also demanded his resignation. “While the foreign secretary lay on a sun lounger, the Taliban advanced,” Labour party's foreign affairs spokesperson Lisa Nandy said.The UK PM stuck to his earlier statement where he said that the Taliban will be judged on the basis of their actions and not words, while “hoping” that they mean what they say. “As I said in the House of Commons, and I think that this is the position of … the President of the United States, President Macron of France, [German Chancellor] Angela Merkel, everybody that I talked to – everybody agreed that we will judge them on their actions, and that is the important thing.”Great Britain has since last Saturday evacuated as many as 1,615 people, including 399 British citizens and their dependents, 320 embassy staff, and a total of 402 Afghans who worked for the UK government in Afghanistan.Since its sweeping triumph over the Afghan troops – an outcome that was emboldened after US President Joe Biden’s announcement of withdrawing American army two decades later, Taliban have portrayed a relatively moderate outlook, assuring women and girls will be allowed to receive education and even work.At the extremist group’s first press conference, spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said that the Taliban are “committed to providing women with their rights based on Islam. "Women can work in the health sector and other sectors where they are needed. There will be no discrimination against women," TOLOnews quoted him as saying.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/committed-to-afghanistan-will-work-with-taliban-if-necessary-uk-pm-johnson-101629559197993.html

Addressing a joint press conference alongside Spanish President Pedro Sanchez and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, von der Leyen put strict conditions for releasing the one billion euros set aside for development said for the next seven years.“So let me be very clear on development aid. The 1 billion euros in EU funds set aside for development aid for the next seven years is tied to strict conditions: respect for human rights, good treatment of minorities, and respect for the rights of women and girls, just to name a few,” said the EU Commission president.She said the situation in Afghanistan is still very unclear and unpredictable, raising apprehensions about the Taliban’s promise of peace and inclusivity. Referring to the reports of women being turned away from their workplace and people being hunted down for their past work, the top EU official said not a “single euro of development aid can go to a regime that denies women and girls their full freedoms and rights to education and careers.”“We may well hear the Taliban's words, but we will measure them above all by their deeds and their actions,” she added.The Taliban’s months-long offensive to topple the Afghan government led by Ashraf Ghani resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people. After the Taliban completed a lightning takeover of Afghanistan on Sunday, the Kabul airport witnessed a chaotic situation as hundreds of desperate Afghans were trying to board military planes flown in by other countries to evacuate their staff and citizens.“This resettlement of vulnerable people is of utmost importance. It is our moral duty,” Von der Leyen said.She also stressed the need to prevent people from falling into the hands of smugglers and human traffickers. “This means, first, that we must offer legal and safe routes globally, organised by us, the international community, to those who need protection,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-a-single-euro-eu-talks-tough-on-taliban-s-promise-of-peace-women-s-rights-101629558851217.html

That storm killed at least 17 people.It has been almost a decade since such severe weather was expected in part of the region."The last time we had hurricane watches issued for the area was for Hurricane Irene, back in late August of 2011," tweeted the National Weather Service in New York City.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-henri-upgraded-to-hurricane-to-make-landfall-on-us-east-coast-on-sunday-101629558543999.html
21-08-2021||World||Science can’t keep up with coronavirus, creating worry for vaccinated||Anecdotes tell us what the data can’t: Vaccinated people appear to be getting the coronavirus at a surprisingly high rate. But exactly how often isn’t clear, nor is it certain how likely they are to spread the virus to others. And now, there’s growing concern that vaccinated people may be more vulnerable to serious illness than previously thought.There’s a dearth of scientific studies with concrete answers, leaving public policy makers and corporate executives to formulate plans based on fragmented information. While some are renewing mask mandates or delaying office reopenings, others cite the lack of clarity to justify staying the course. It can all feel like a mess.“We have to be humble about what we do know and what we don’t know,” said Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the head of the nonprofit Resolve to Save Lives. “There are a few things we can say definitively. One is that this is a hard question to address.”Absent clear public health messaging, vaccinated people are left confused about how to protect themselves. Just how vulnerable they are is a key variable not just for public health officials trying to figure out, say, when booster shots might be needed, but also to inform decisions about whether to roll back reopenings amid a new wave of the virus. On a smaller scale, the unknowns have left music lovers unsure if it’s OK to see a concert and prompted a fresh round of hang-wringing among parents pondering what school is going to look like. In lieu of answers, what has emerged is a host of case studies providing somewhat different pictures of breakthrough infections. Variables including when the surveys were conducted, whether the delta variant was present, how much of the population was vaccinated and even what the weather was like at the time make it hard to compare results and suss out patterns. It’s difficult to know which data might ultimately carry more heft.“It’s quite clear that we have more breakthroughs now,” said Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco. “We all know someone who has had one. But we don’t have great clinical data.”One of the best known outbreaks among vaccinated people occurred in the small beach town of Provincetown, Massachusetts, as thousands of vaccinated and unvaccinated alike gathered on dance floors and at house parties over the Fourth of July weekend to celebrate the holiday -- and what seemed like a turning point in the pandemic. About three-fourths of the 469 infections were among vaccinated people. Authors of a CDC case study said this might mean that they were just as likely to transmit Covid-19 as the unvaccinated. Even so, they cautioned, as more people are vaccinated, it’s natural that they would also account for a larger share of Covid-19 infections and this one study was not sufficient to draw any conclusions. The incident prompted the CDC to reverse a recommendation it had issued just a few weeks earlier and once again urge the vaccinated to mask up in certain settings.Still, the particular details of that cluster of cases may have made that outbreak especially bad, according to Gandhi.“The rate of mild symptomatic outbreaks in this population was higher because of a lot of indoor activity (including intimacy), rain that weekend, not much outside time and mixture of people with different vaccination status,” she said in an email.A newly released, far larger CDC case study of infections in New York state, meanwhile, found that the number of breakthrough infections has steadily ticked up since May, accounting for almost 4% of cases by mid-July. Those researchers cautioned that factors such as easing public health restrictions and the rise of the highly contagious delta variant might impact the results. Yet another CDC case study, in Colorado, found that the breakthrough infection rate in one county, Mesa, was significantly higher than the rest of the state, at 7% versus about 5%. The report suggested it was perhaps because the delta variant was circulating more widely there, but also noted the ages of patients in Mesa and the lower vaccination rate may have played a role.Research out of Israel has strongly suggested that immunity to the virus wanes in the months after inoculation, and more recently, that breakthrough cases may eventually lead to an uptick in hospitalizations. Case studies and data from some states in the U.S. have similarly shown an increase in breakthrough cases over time. But with the delta variant also on the rise, it’s difficult to tell whether waning immunity to any type of coronavirus infection is to blame, or if the vaccinations are particularly ineffective against the delta variant. It could be both, of course. Changing behavior among vaccinated people could be a factor, too, as they return to social gatherings and travel and dining indoors.All that said, some facts are well established at this point. Vaccinated people infected with the virus are much less likely to need to go to the hospital, much less likely to need intubation and much less likely to die from the illness. There’s no doubt that vaccines provide significant protection. But a large proportion of the nation -- almost 30% of U.S. adults -- have not been vaccinated, a fact that has conspired with the highly contagious delta variant to push the country into a new wave of outbreaks. “The big picture here is that the vaccines are working and the reason for the spike in the U.S. is we have too little vaccine uptake,” Frieden said. To a certain extent, breakthrough cases of any virus are expected. In clinical trials, no Covid vaccine was 100% effective -- even the best vaccines never are. The more the virus is in circulation, the greater the risk of breakthrough cases. It’s also common for some aspects of viral immunity to naturally wane over time. For the time being, there are simply more questions than answers. Are breakthrough infections ticking up because of the delta variant, waning immunity or a return to normal life? Are vaccinated people more vulnerable to severe illness than previously thought? Just how common are breakthrough infections? It’s anyone’s guess.“It is generally the case that we have to make public health decisions based on imperfect data,” Frieden said. “But there is just a lot we don’t know.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/science-can-t-keep-up-with-coronavirus-creating-worry-for-vaccinated-101629555375239.html

21-08-2021||World||What is the role of Haqqani network, Afghanistan's most feared militants, in new Taliban regime?||Some of the Taliban's top leaders are gathering in Kabul to discuss the formation of a new Afghan government -- including a representative from the Haqqani network, the country's most feared militants.The Haqqanis have been blamed for some of the deadliest attacks in recent years, claiming the lives of civilians, government officials and foreign forces.Despite their reputation, they are expected to be powerful players in the new regime following the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan last week.Who are the Haqqanis?The shadowy group was formed by Jalaluddin Haqqani, who gained prominence in the 1980s as a hero of the anti-Soviet jihad. At the time, he was a valuable CIA asset as the United States and its allies such as Pakistan funnelled arms and money to the mujahideen.During that conflict and following the Soviet withdrawal, Jalaluddin Haqqani fostered close ties with foreign jihadists -- including Osama bin Laden.He later allied with the Taliban who took over Afghanistan in 1996, serving as a minister for the Islamist regime until it was toppled by US-led forces in 2001.Jalaluddin Haqqani's death after a long illness was announced by the Taliban in 2018, and his son Sirajuddin formally became the network's chief.Thanks to their financial and military strength -- and a reputation for ruthlessness -- the Haqqani network is considered semi-autonomous while remaining within the Taliban fold.Mainly based in eastern Afghanistan -- with alleged bases across the border in Pakistan's northwest -- the group became more visible in the Taliban leadership in recent years, and Sirajuddin Haqqani was appointed deputy leader in 2015.His younger brother Anas, once imprisoned and sentenced to death by the previous Afghan government, has held talks with former president Hamid Karzai and ex-chief executive Abdullah Abdullah since the fall of Kabul last weekend.Also Read | Economy, security: As Baradar arrives in Kabul, Taliban finalise governance planWhy are they so widely feared?The Haqqani network is blamed for some of the deadliest and most shocking attacks in Afghanistan during the last two decades.They have been designated a foreign terrorist group by the United States, and are also under United Nations sanctions.The Haqqanis have a reputation for frequently using suicide bombers -- including drivers in cars and trucks packed with huge amounts of explosives -- and have demonstrated the ability to carry out complex, high-casualty assaults on major targets including military installations and embassies.In October 2013, Afghan forces intercepted a Haqqani truck in eastern Afghanistan that contained nearly 28 tonnes (61,500 pounds) of explosives, according to the US National Counterterrorism Center.The Haqqanis have been accused of assassinations -- including an attempt against then-president Karzai in 2008 -- and kidnappings of officials and Western citizens, for ransom and forcing prisoner exchanges.They have also long been suspected of links with the Pakistani military establishment -- US Admiral Mike Mullen described them as a "veritable arm" of Islamabad's intelligence in 2011.Pakistan denies the allegation.The Haqqanis have also hugely contributed to the Taliban's fighting ranks, and are the group's "most combat-ready forces", UN monitors said in a June report.The monitors also described the network as the "primary liaison" between the Taliban and Al-Qaeda.What is their role in the new Taliban regime?The Haqqanis have emerged as serious players in the Taliban's political project with at least two of their leaders in Kabul as talks begin on forming the next government.Sirajuddin Haqqani's formal elevation to the deputy leader position six years ago cemented that role, analysts say.And the release of his brother Anas from Afghan custody in 2019 was seen as a move to help kickstart the direct US-Taliban talks that eventually led to the troop withdrawal.Sirajuddin Haqqani even wrote an op-ed in The New York Times last year, outlining the Taliban's position on the US talks and the conflict in Afghanistan -- though in diplomatic tones that belied the network's violent reputation.While Anas Haqqani has held talks with Karzai, his uncle Khalil Haqqani was seen leading prayers in Kabul on Friday.Sirajuddin and Khalil are both still listed as wanted by the United States, with millions of dollars in bounties on offer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-the-role-of-haqqani-network-afghanistan-s-most-feared-militants-in-new-taliban-regime-101629547326727.html

Capital Kabul's capture on Sunday signified the end of the US's longest war, launched after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks.On Tuesday, Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban's longtime spokesman in his first-ever public appearance to address those concerns at a news conference, promised the Taliban would honour women's rights within the norms of Islamic law, in an effort to portray a more moderate stance.During a three-hour meeting of university professors and owners of private educational institutions, Taliban representative and Head of Higher Education, Afghanistan, Mullah Farid said there is no alternative and co-education must end.He also said virtuous female lecturers would be allowed to teach only female students but not the male ones.Also Read | Islamic 'scholars' to decide on women’s 'right' to education: Taliban leaderFarid called co-education the 'root of all evils in society', the report said.In the last two decades, Afghanistan has implemented a mixed system of co-education and gender-based separate classes in all universities and institutes.Educationalists said government universities would not be affected by the decision but private institutes would struggle with already a low number of female students.Also Read | No revealing slipper, women not allowed to go out alone: Taliban diktatHerat, according to official estimates, has 40,000 students and 2,000 lecturers in private and government universities and colleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-ban-co-education-in-afghanistan-s-herat-province-report-101629545724702.html

And it is not what the world may think. Sharing a photo of Taliban leaders carrying firearms, the technocrat noticed that the Taliban leaders were not wearing masks. Not one of them. Elon Musk also added his takeaway questioning whether they have not heard about the Delta variant which is driving the resurgence of the Covid pandemic across the world."Really? You're gonna criticise them on that? And not what they achieved in 19 days what it took the US 20 years and it still failed?

In his typical tweet-like statements, Trump accused Biden of surrendering to the Taliban, asking whether he will apologise for the “greatest tactical mistake” in history.“Afghanistan under Biden was not a withdrawal, it was a surrender. Will he apologize for the greatest tactical mistake in history, pulling the Military out before our citizens?” he asked.“Leaving Americans behind for death is an unforgivable dereliction of duty, which will go down in infamy,” the former president said in another statement.Trump has issued over a dozen statements since the Taliban’s takeover, attacking Biden for failing to evacuate US nationals before the troops' withdrawal.The previous administration under Trump had signed a deal with the Taliban in February 2020 for complete withdrawal from Afghanistan and insisted on peace talks with the Afghan government. But as the US-led foreign troops finalised their pull out, Taliban fighters launched an offensive against Afghan forces and ousted Ashraf Ghani’s government.Also Read | Confusion over Indian evacuees’ status, reports suggest Taliban rounded them upThe lightning push by the Taliban took the world by surprise and many countries, including the US, are now rushing to evacuate their citizens from Afghanistan.

We went to Afghanistan for the express purpose of getting rid of al Qaeda in Afghanistan as well as getting Osama bin Laden, and we did,” Biden told reporters, reiterating his stance of ending the “forever war”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greatest-tactical-mistake-trump-s-fresh-salvo-on-biden-s-hasty-withdrawal-from-afghanistan-101629538480423.html

21-08-2021||World||Haunted by Syrian war, Europe seeks to avoid influx of migrants from Afghanistan||From above, the new border wall separating Turkey from Iran looks like a white snake winding through the barren hills. So far it only covers a third of the 540-kilometer (335-mile) border, leaving plenty of gaps for migrants to slip across in the dead of night.Traffic on this key migration route from central Asia to Europe has remained relatively stable compared to previous years. But European countries, as well as Turkey, fear the sudden return of Taliban rule in Afghanistan could change that.Haunted by a 2015 migration crisis fueled by the Syrian war, European leaders desperately want to avoid another large-scale influx of migrants and refugees from Afghanistan. Except for those who helped Western forces in the country's two-decade war, the message to Afghans considering fleeing to Europe is: If you must leave, go to neighboring countries, but don’t come here.“It must be our goal to keep the majority of the people in the region,” Austrian Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said this week, echoing what many European leaders say.European Union officials told a meeting of interior ministers this week that the most important lesson from 2015 was not to leave Afghans to their own devices, and that without urgent humanitarian help they will start moving, according to a confidential German diplomatic memo obtained by The Associated PressAustria, among the EU’s migration hard-liners, suggested setting up “deportation centers” in countries neighboring Afghanistan so that EU countries can deport Afghans who have been denied asylum even if they cannot be sent back to their homeland.The desperate scenes of people clinging to aircraft taking off from Kabul’s airport have only deepened Europe’s anxiety over a potential refugee crisis. The U.S. and its NATO allies are scrambling to evacuate thousands of Afghans who fear they’ll be punished by the Taliban for having worked with Western forces. But other Afghans are unlikely to get the same welcome.Even Germany, which since 2015 has admitted more Syrians than any other Western nation, is sending a different signal today.Several German politicians, including Armin Laschet, the center-right Union bloc’s candidate to succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor, warned last week that there must be “no repeat” of the migration crisis of 2015.On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron stressed that, “Europe alone cannot shoulder the consequences” of the situation in Afghanistan and “must anticipate and protect ourselves against significant irregular migratory flows.”Britain, which left the EU in 2020, said it would welcome 5,000 Afghan refugees this year and resettle a total of 20,000 in coming years.Besides that, there have been few concrete offers from European countries, which besides evacuating their own citizens and Afghan collaborators, say they’re focusing on helping Afghans inside their country and in neighboring countries such as Iran and Pakistan.Europe “should not wait until people stand at our external border,” EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johanson said.Greece, whose scenic islands facing the Turkish coast were the European point of entry for hundreds of thousands of Syrians, Iraqis, Afghans and others six years ago, has made clear it doesn’t want to relive that crisis.Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said Wednesday that Greece won’t accept being the “gateway for irregular flows into the EU,” and that it considers Turkey to be a safe place for Afghans.Such talk makes Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan see red. His country already hosts 3.6 million Syrians and hundreds of thousands of Afghans, and he has used the threat of sending them to Europe for political leverage.“Turkey has no duty, responsibility or obligation to be Europe’s refugee warehouse,” Erdogan warned in a speech Thursday.The Turkish president talked about migration from Afghanistan in a rare phone call with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on Friday, and also is discussing the issue with Iran, a statement from Erdogan's office said.Attitudes toward migrants have hardened in Europe following the 2015 crisis, fueling the rise of far-right parties like the Alternative for Germany, the biggest opposition party in parliament ahead of the federal election next month.Even in Turkey, migrants from Syria and Afghanistan, once treated like Muslim brethren, are increasingly viewed with suspicion as the country grapples with economic problems including rising inflation and unemployment.Acknowledging the public’s “unease” about migration, Erdogan noted how his government has reinforced the eastern border with Iran with military, gendarmerie, police and the new wall, which has been under construction since 2017.AP journalists near the Turkish border with Iran encountered dozens of Afghans this week, mostly young men, but also some women and children. Smuggled across the border at night in small groups, they said they left their country to escape the Taliban, violence and poverty.“The situation in Afghanistan was intense,” said one young man, Hassan Khan. “The Taliban captured the whole of Afghanistan. But there is no work in Afghanistan, we were compelled to come here.”Observers say there are no indications yet of any mass movement across the border. Turkish authorities say they have intercepted 35,000 Afghans entering the country illegally so far this year, compared with over 50,000 in all of 2020 and more than 200,000 in 2019.Metin Corbatir, head of the Ankara-based Research Center on Asylum and Migration, said there has been a small increase in arrivals across the border from Iran recently, “but there is no mass migration.”Farha Bhoyroo, who works for the U.N. refugee agency in Iran, gave a similar assessment of the Afghan-Iranian border.“So far numbers are quite stable,” she said. “We have seen a slight increase in Afghan refugees coming to Iran, but we don’t qualify it as an influx.”UNCHR estimates that 90% of the 2.6 million Afghan refugees outside of the country live in neighboring Iran and Pakistan. Both countries also host large numbers of Afghans who left in search of better economic opportunities.By comparison, about 630,000 Afghans have applied for asylum in EU countries in the past 10 years, with the highest numbers in Germany, Hungary, Greece and Sweden, according to the EU statistics agency. Last year, 44,000 Afghans applied for asylum in the 27-country bloc.Jan Egeland, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said it’s not a forgone conclusion that the Taliban takeover will result in a new refugee crisis.“I would warn against a self-fulfilling prophecy,” he told AP. Afghans are “scared, bewildered but also hopeful that a long, long war will be over and maybe now they can avoid the crossfire.”He said much depends on the Taliban allowing development and humanitarian work in the country and on donor nations continuing to fund those efforts.“If you would have a collapse of public services and if there would be a major food crisis, there will be for sure a mass movement of people,” Egeland said.___Ritter reported from Rome.

Ayoubi said one woman was "put on fire because she was accused of bad cooking for Taliban fighters" in northern Afghanistan."They are forcing people to give them food and cook them food. Also, there are so many young women are being in the past few weeks being shipped into neighbouring countries in coffins to be used as sex slaves,” Ayoubi, who lives in the US after ‘fleeing for my life’ from the Taliban, said.

The news came on a day when President Joe Biden said he is not aware of American citizens facing difficulties getting through Taliban checkpoints.Pentagon leaders had earlier said that the scenes unfolding in Afghanistan, as citizens frantically tried to get out of the country and escape the new Taliban rule, were tough for them to watch.Austin told the House members that Americans have been "harassed and beaten" by the Taliban while trying to escape from Afghanistan, Politico reported quoting people aware of the developments of the briefing call. He further said that this is "unacceptable", Politico further reported.There are currently about 5,800 US troops at the airport in Kabul to help with evacuation efforts, an American official said on Friday. Austin has ordered about 6,000 troops to Kabul, a number that is expected to be reached in the coming days, according to the official.The US is trying hard to speed up the process of evacuation. With the August 31 deadline looming, tens of thousands still remained to be airlifted from the war-torn country. The United States is also evacuating Afghans who helped its troops during their two-decade-long stay in the country.“We have a moral obligation to help those who helped us. And I feel the urgency deeply,” Austin said on Friday.About 2,000 passengers were flown out on each of the past two days, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said.He added that the military has aircraft available to evacuate 5,000 to 9,000 people per day, but until Thursday far fewer designated evacuees had been able to reach, and then enter, the airport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-defence-secretary-lloyd-austin-says-americans-beaten-by-taliban-report-101629529738291.html

She did not take questions.The Kabul airport has been the site of chaos with thousands of desperate Afghans trying to flee as they clutched papers, children and belongings, as people from other countries also sought to leave after US and other foreign troops withdrew.At least 12 people have been killed since the Islamist insurgents took the capital on Sunday, NATO and Taliban officials said.Retno called for a "an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned inclusive political process" that will bring peace and stability in the country, and for women's rights to be upheld.Four Indonesian diplomats in the Pakistan-based mission will assess the situation in Afghanistan daily to determine next steps, she said.An operation for Indonesia, the world's biggest Muslim-majority country, to fly home including embassy staff and children, took longer than anticipated due to the situation at the Kabul airport, she said.Indonesia also picked up five Filipinos at the request of their government and two Afghan nationals, Retno said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-moves-afghan-diplomatic-mission-to-pakistan-101629527150406.html

However, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said that the presence of al Qaeda is not significant enough to merit a threat to the US as it used to be 20 years ago.Biden, while interacting with reporters on Friday, said there is a need to put things in perspective (about US troops' withdrawal from Afghanistan). "What interest do we have in Afghanistan at this point, with al Qaeda gone?" the President said."We went to Afghanistan for the express purpose of getting rid of al Qaeda as well as getting Osama bin Laden. And we did," he added.Hours later, the Pentagon acknowledged the presence of the terror group in Afghanistan amid its large-scale evacuation from the war-torn country."We know that al Qaeda is a presence as well as ISIS in Afghanistan and we've talked about that for quite some time," John Kirby said during a press briefing.Kirby said they do not believe the number of al Qaeda terrorists in the country "is exorbitantly high but we don't have an exact figure for you." He said their "intelligence gathering ability in Afghanistan isn't what it used to be".The issue about the presence of al Qaeda has gained prominence since the Taliban ousted a civilian government and took control of the power by force. The United Nations has raised concern about the threat from terror group like al Qaeda in Afghanistan in the wake of Taliban takeover saying the security situation remain fragile.Also Read: IAF aircraft evacuates over 85 Indians from KabulHowever, as per the US-Taliban deal signed in Doha last year, the Taliban vowed to cut ties to al Qaeda.

A senior Taliban official told AFP that Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar -- who co-founded the group -- would meet "jihadi leaders and politicians for an inclusive government set-up".Taliban officials said they included a top official of the Haqqani network, which has been designated a terrorist organisation by the United States with million-dollar bounties on its leadership.Also Read | Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar returns to Afghanistan after 20 years. Who is he?Six days after the hardline Islamist movement swept to power, the flow of people trying to flee continued to overwhelm the international community.Roads leading to Kabul airport were choked with traffic, while families hoping for a miracle escape crowded between the barbed-wire surrounds of an unofficial no man's land separating the Taliban from US troops and remnants of an Afghan special forces brigade helping them.Video of a US soldier lifting a baby over a wall at Kabul's airport offered the latest imagery of utter despair, following horror footage of people hanging onto the outside of departing planes."Please, please, please help me... where should I go, what should I do," one man, who said he worked for the US embassy in the mid-2000s, wrote on a WhatsApp group set up for people to share information on how to get out."I have tried to get there (to the airport) for some days, but I cannot reach. Please save me."Thousands of US soldiers are at the airport trying to shepherd foreigners and Afghans onto flights, but President Joe Biden admitted the troop presence offered no guarantees of safe passage."This is one of the largest, most difficult airlifts in history," Biden said in a televised address."I cannot promise what the final outcome will be, or... that it will be without risk of loss."Evacuation deadlineUS military helicopters were deployed to rescue more than 150 Americans unable to reach the airport on Friday morning, an official in Washington said.It was the first report of US forces going beyond the airport to help people seeking evacuation.A German civilian was also shot and wounded on his way to the airport, a government spokeswoman in Berlin said on Friday.Biden had set a deadline of August 31 to completely withdraw all troops from Afghanistan, but he flagged this could be extended to continue the airlifts.About 13,000 people have left on American military aircraft, the White House said. Thousands of others have fled on other foreign military flights.US diminishedThe crisis has cast another shadow over the United States' status as a global superpower and its ability to help allies around the world.The Taliban swept into the capital last week, ending two decades of war, after Biden pulled nearly all US troops out of Afghanistan.Biden and other US allies were stunned at how quickly the Taliban were able to rout government forces, who surrendered en masse.The Taliban have promised "positively different" rule from their 1996-2001 stint in power, which was infamous for an ultra-fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law.Women were excluded from public life, girls banned from school and people stoned to death for adultery.They have vowed not to seek revenge against their opponents, promising a general amnesty for anyone who worked with the US-backed government.But an intelligence document for the United Nations said militants were going door-to-door hunting down former government officials and those who worked with US and NATO forces.According to the confidential document by the UN's threat assessment consultants seen by AFP, militants were also screening people on the way to Kabul airport.The German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle reported that the Taliban had shot dead the relative of one of its journalists while searching for the editor.Collective prideAt the first Friday prayers since the Taliban's return to power, imams and guest speakers celebrated the defeat of the United States.At one mosque in Kabul, gunmen flanked a scholar as he delivered a fiery speech in which he recounted how Afghans had beaten the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and now the United States on the battlefield."Afghans have once again shown collective pride," he said.At another mosque, the imam referenced the tragic scenes at the airport, describing those trying to flee as not having strong enough religious convictions."Those with weak faith are running after or hanging from American planes," he said."They should stay and build their country."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-co-founder-mullah-abdul-ghani-baradar-in-kabul-amid-talks-to-set-up-govt-101629526736365.html
21-08-2021||World||India expresses disappointment over continued ban on Canada flights||India has written to the Canadian government expressing its “disappointment” over the continuing ban of direct commercial flights.The ban was originally imposed on April 22 and was scheduled to expire on August 21, but on August 9, Transport Canada announced it had been further extended till September 21. The April decision had been predicated on concerns over the rising Covid-19 cases in India, particularly the spread of the Delta variant.In note verbales, or diplomatic communications, sent to Global Affairs Canada, the country’s foreign ministry, India’s high commission in Ottawa stated that the extension had “caused concern and anxiety” among nationals of the two countries seeking to travel between them.The Canadian government’s ban prevents all direct passenger flights from India.The Indian government is seeking resumption of those flights and scrapping of the mandatory RT-PCR tests required for travellers from India who transit through third countries.The ongoing restrictions, it has argued, “adversely affected” nearly 200,000 Indian students looking at starting post-secondary education in Canada and caused “great inconvenience” to the nearly 1.6 million strong Indo-Canadian community.It said that early return to normalcy in global mobility was in the interest of both countries.It also pointed out that India has administered over 570 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines, its declining positivity rate and expansion of its testing regime as well the proof of vaccination available digitally via the Cowin app.It also underscored that the daily caseload in India at this time is less than half that in September last year, during the first wave in India, when direct flights continued uninterrupted between the two countries.Given that context, it requested Canadian authorities to take steps to remove the restrictions currently in force.Under a reciprocal air bubble arrangement between the countries, Air India started operating flights from May 2020 and Air Canada since August that year and together accounted for daily flights between India and Canada till the ban came into place in April this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-expresses-disappointment-over-continued-ban-on-canada-flights-101629523087588.html

It is forecast to reach land later on Friday or in the early hours of Saturday.Veracruz and its waters are home to several oil installations, including Petroleos Mexicanos' Lazaro Cardenas refinery in Minatitlan in the south of the state. Latest forecasts showed Grace expected to hit Veracruz well to the north of Minatitlan.Through Sunday, the NHC said Grace would dump 6 to 12 inches (15-30 cm) of rain over large swaths of eastern and central Mexico, and up to 18 inches in some areas. The heavy rainfall would likely cause areas of flash and urban flooding, it added."We ask the population to be very alert," Laura Velazquez, head of Mexico's civil protection authority, told a regular news conference with President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.Grace pounded Mexico's Caribbean coast on Thursday, downing trees and causing power outages for nearly 700,000 people, but without causing loss of life, authorities said. Earlier in the week, it doused Jamaica and Haiti with torrential rain.In Tecolutla, a resort on the Gulf of Mexico, some tourists from Mexico City had still been enjoying the calm before the storm in the afternoon, even as light rain started to fall."We had to come, even if we get a bit wet," said Guillermina Morales, who was on a trip planned over four months ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/grace-becomes-major-hurricane-barrels-toward-mexico-s-gulf-coast-101629520427305.html

The day spreads awareness about issues that the elderly have to face in their everyday lives and they are thanked for their service and contribution towards the betterment of society.The World Senior Citizen’s Day was officially founded by former United States president Ronald Reagan in 1988. Reagan signed the promulgation of 5847 on August 19, 1988, which then appeared as the National Day of the Third Age on August 21. World Senior Citizen’s Day was first observed in 1991.Senior citizens are an important part of any society. However, many of them find it extremely difficult to survive in today’s modern world amid a rapid advancement of technology along with the changing social and economical environment. The coronavirus pandemic, which struck the world last year, requires even more specific care for the elderly so that they do not contract Covid-19.Some of the most common problems which senior citizens face include- forgetfulness, lack of understanding of technological devices such as smartphones and computers, health complications, loneliness and lack of financial support etc. In some cases, they also have to go through physical and mental abuse by their children and other family members.Senior citizens, some of who live alone, have a constant fear of what they will do if they suffer from a chronic disease in the present or future.In India, any person above the age of 60 is a senior citizen. Over the years, the central and state governments have announced a slew of schemes for their welfare. Some of these include the Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Scheme, National Programme for the Health Care of Elderly (NPHCE), Rashtriya Vayoshri Yojana among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-senior-citizen-s-day-today-a-look-at-problems-which-the-elderly-face-101629516389435.html

Both Mullah Baradar, said to be the front-runner as the Taliban candidate for President of Afghanistan, and Mullah Yaqoob, the son of Mullah Omar and deputy leader of Taliban, are in Kandahar.While ambassador Wang met his Pakistani counterpart on Wednesday to closely cooperate on the Afghan issue, he is understood to have met Mullah Baradar in Kandahar to offer Beijing’s help in the reconstruction of the Islamist Taliban-ruled country. China is not only pleased with the humiliation of the US at the hands of the Taliban but is also looking to sell the Belt Road Initiative (BRI) and exploit Afghan reserves of lithium and copper in the name of reconstruction. The larger Chinese game-plan is to reach the Central Asian Republics via Afghanistan for evacuation of gas and mineral resources.Also read | 3 Jaish terrorists killed in encounter at J&K's TralTaliban’s ideological comrade in jihad, Jaish’s Mufti Rauf met Mullah Yaqoob, who also doubles up as an ideologue in the absence of Mullah Haibatullah Akundzada, in Kandahar to offer allegiance on behalf of the Bahawalpur based group. Mufti Rauf's elder brother and Jaish Emir Maulana Masood Azhar was a Deobandi ideologue at a Harkat-ul-Ansar terror training camp in Khost before he was arrested on the outskirts of Srinagar in 1994. Azhar formed the Jaish group after his release in the Indian Airlines IC-814 hijacking to Kandahar in exchange for hostages. The entire hijacking was planned with the help of the then ruling Taliban leadership in December 1999.Also watch | Joe Biden warns Taliban amid criticism over Afghanistan crisis, evacuations﻿While the current Taliban leadership has gone on record saying that it will not allow Afghan soil to be used against any third country, the Sunni Pashtun UN-designated terrorist group has very close operational links with Al Qaeda and Jaish-e-Mohammed. Both these global terrorist groups are looking for sanctuaries within Taliban-ruled Afghanistan to train its cadre and wage jihad against their adversaries. The Taliban has openly advocated jihad as their fundamental Islamic duty.Also read | 'Any attack on our forces and...': Biden's warning to TalibanWhile Maulana Masood Azhar lives under the highest protection in Bahawalpur madrasa, Mufti Rauf Azhar’s meeting with Kandahar leadership of the Taliban assumes significance as Jaish’s main target is India.

While China will maintain pressure on India on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and cement its ties with India’s adversaries in the neighbourhood, the rise of the Taliban will have an impact on India’s internal security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-envoy-and-jaish-commander-separately-call-on-taliban-leadership-101629514266097.html

Henkel also declined to specify the province where the two worked together.Now 46, Henkel lives in Colorado and works as a project manager for a cybersecurity firm."I relied on my interpreter to help me navigate the culture, navigate the protocols and navigate the language barrier," he said.Among the most valued contributions from "Kevin," Henkel said, was his ability to spot local leaders who had ties with the Taliban. "He could tell that there was a reign of fear that was being implemented," in a particular town, Henkel said.He also recalled an instance when "we actually got hit in a valley and we had to call in close air support to save us because we had hundreds of Taliban in these positions up in these hills. Kevin was the one who told us ahead of time, 'Hey, this was going to happen.'"From Henkel's experience with the Taliban, he believes the group will target those first who worked with foreigners."They have a list of all the interpreters that have ever worked for NATO," he said. "The only penalty that is acceptable to them is death. And that extends to his (Kevin's) family."The Taliban, for its part, said in a June statement former interpreters were not at risk, but should "show remorse."Pentagon spokesman John Kirby has said the United States will seek to evacuate as many Afghan interpreters as possible.When Henkel heard about US plans to pull out after a 20-year commitment in Afghanistan, he was "enraged."Having led combat operations himself, "there's usually an exfil - exfil plan means an exfiltration plan... I am not seeing happening right now," a situation Henkel described as "unacceptable" for some 18,000 Afghan translators and their families.According to Henkel, "Kevin" and his family have been turned away at local airfields by US forces while trying to escape, despite pressure to secure his departure from U.S. Representatives Joe Neguse and veteran, Jason Crow, both Democrats from Colorado.Crow's office confirmed his advocacy via telephone. Neguse was not immediately available for comment. "It is pure chaos," Henkel said "Kevin" told him via text Friday morning.The veteran and his interpreter are communicating as they always have via webchat. "We even talked about, wouldn't it be great someday if our kids could play together in a playground together. And we could grow old next to each other," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-only-have-hours-us-army-captain-s-desperate-appeal-to-save-his-afghan-interpreter-101629511334393.html

Biden also reiterated that his administration is keeping a "laser focus on the counterterrorism mission", along with close coordination with allies in the region. The US is also scanning for any potential terrorist threat at or around the airport, including from the Islamic State affiliates in Afghanistan.Also Read | Chinese envoy and Jaish commander separately call on Taliban leadership"We made clear to the Taliban that any attack, any attack on our forces or disruption of our operations at the airport will be met with a swift and forceful response," Biden told reporters at a White House news conference.

For this purpose, the US president has spoken with his counterparts in Britain, Germany, and France over the past few days."We all agreed that we should convene, and we will convene the G7 meeting next week, a group of the world's leading democracies so that together we can coordinate our mutual approach, our united approach on Afghanistan moving forward," he said.Also Read | 'Well and alive': Afghan pop star Aryana Sayeed leaves Kabul for Istanbul after Taliban take overBiden once again reiterated his defence behind the troop withdrawal in Afghanistan, claiming that the US finished its "mission" in the country after eliminating the al Qaeda outfits there."Look, let's put this thing in perspective here," the US president said. "What interest do we have in Afghanistan at this point with al Qaeda gone? We went to Afghanistan for the express purpose of getting rid of al Qaeda in Afghanistan as well as getting Osama bin Laden, and we did.”"You've known my position for a long, long time," Biden continued. "It's time to end this war. The estimates of the cost of this war over the last 20 years range from a minimum of $1 trillion to a think tank at one of the universities saying $2 trillion.

21-08-2021||World||Taliban websites disappear from internet amid tech crackdown||Taliban websites that delivered the victorious insurgents' official messages to Afghans and the world at large in five languages went offline abruptly Friday, indicating an effort to try to squelch them.It is not immediately clear, though, why the sites in the Pashto, Urdu, Arabic, English, and Dari languages went offline Friday. They had been shielded by Cloudflare, a San Francisco-based content delivery network and denial-of-service protection provider.Cloudflare has not responded to emails and phone calls seeking comment on the development, which was first reported by The Washington Post. The Cloudflare shield prevents the public from knowing who exactly hosts the sites.Also Friday, the popular encrypted messaging service WhatsApp removed a number of Taliban groups, according to Rita Katz, director of SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks online extremism.The websites' disappearance may just be temporary as the Taliban secures new hosting arrangements. But the reported removal of the WhatsApp groups followed the banning of Taliban accounts by Facebook, the service's parent company, on Tuesday after the US-backed Afghan government fell to the Taliban.WhatsApp spokesperson Danielle Meister did not confirm the removal but referred The Associated Press to a statement the company issued earlier this week saying it was “obligated to adhere to US sanctions laws. This includes banning accounts that appear to represent themselves as official accounts of the Taliban.”Katz said via email that she hoped the removal of the Taliban websites is just a first step to diminishing its online presence.Unlike the Taliban of 20 years ago that the US drove from power in Afghanistan, today's Taliban is immensely media savvy and its online infrastructure “inspires and mobilizes" al-Qaida and other extremist Islamist factions, said Katz.“Tech companies should do what they can to get ahead of this problem as soon as possible, as the group's online presence is stoking a newly emboldened jihadi movement worldwide,” she added.Twitter has not removed Taliban accounts and the group's spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, has more than 300,000 followers there. The company indicated Tuesday that as long as such accounts observe its rules — including not inciting or glorifying violence — they will remain up.Like Facebook, Google's YouTube considers the Taliban a terrorist organization and prohibits it from operating accounts.The Taliban is not on the US list of foreign terrorist organizations, but the US has imposed sanctions on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-websites-disappear-from-internet-amid-tech-crackdown-101629507864537.html

21-08-2021||World||Taliban step up reprisals after promising amnesty||There’s mounting evidence the Taliban are cracking down on dissent in Afghanistan and carrying out reprisals, even after its leadership promised an amnesty, adding urgency to global efforts to evacuate those most at risk.Fighters from the fundamentalist group are searching for journalists in Kabul and other provinces, German media organization Deutsche Welle said on Friday as it reported the killing of a close relative of one of its staffers.A Norway-based private intelligence group that provides information to the UN said it has evidence the Taliban have rounded up Afghans on a blacklist of people they believe worked with the previous Afghan administration or with US-led forces, and that there could be mass executions.And Amnesty International said it received witness accounts of nine ethnic minority members being executed in July and warned of the likelihood of more killings as Taliban establish control.These reports came even as thousands of people, desperate to flee the country, were still thronging the airport, according to an official who spoke to Reuters, even though the Taliban have urged people without legal travel documents to go home and appeared to have begun blocking access to the airport.“Taliban are intensifying the hunt-down of all individuals and collaborators with the former regime, and if unsuccessful, target and arrest the families and punish them according to their own interpretation of Sharia law,” said a report, dated Wednesday, by RHIPTO Norwegian Center for Global Analyses.“Particularly at risk are individuals in central positions in military, police and investigative units,” it added.Tens of thousands of people remain to be evacuated ahead of the United States’ August 31 deadline for troop withdrawal. The desperation has been captured in images and videos from the airport, where people clung onto a taxing American military plane as it took off, leaving several – including an Afghan national sportsperson – to plunge to their deaths.On Thursday, officials in the UK told Sky News that people were passing their children, including infants, over barb wire airport fences in an attempt to get them to safety outside of the country.A US defense official said about 5,700 people, including about 250 Americans, were flown out of Kabul aboard 16 C-17 transport planes. In all, more than 18,000 people have been flown out of Kabul since the Taliban took over Afghanistan’s capital, a NATO official told Reuters.A Taliban spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment, Reuters reported. Since seizing Kabul, the Taliban have sought to present a more moderate face to the world, saying they wanted peace and would not take revenge against old enemies.The four-page report reproduced a letter it said had been written to one alleged collaborator who was taken from his Kabul apartment this week and detained for questioning over his role as a counter-terrorism official in the previous government.Reuters could not independently verify its authenticity.The letter, dated Monday, from the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan’s Military Commission, noted that the detainee had travelled to the UK as part of his role “which indicates you have had excellent relations with the American and British”.“If you do not report to the commission, your family members will be arrested instead. You and your family members will be treated based on Sharia law,” the letter said.The detainee’s name was redacted.Separately, a senior member of the security forces of the ousted administration sent a message to journalists saying that the Taliban had obtained secret national security documents and Taliban were arresting former intelligence and security staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-step-up-reprisals-after-promising-amnesty-101629493392372.html

Evacuees include family members of US citizens, special immigration visa (SIV) applicants and their families, and vulnerable Afghans. Earlier on Friday, Biden and vice-president Kamala Harris met with the national security team to discuss the evolving situation in Afghanistan ahead of the remarks.Biden’s personal approval rating dropped 7 percentage points in an Ipsos/Reuters poll announced on Monday, to 46% from 53%, the previous week. This is his lowest rating in the Ipsos/Reuters weekly poll so far, and came amidst the collapse of the Afghanistan government, return of the Taliban and the evacuation crisis that played out in full public view.An Ipsos/Reuters poll conducted on August 16 found that 44 % adults thought the Biden administration had done a good job on Afghanistan, while 42% thought it had done a bad job. His three predecessors fared far better: George W Bush 47% good and 39% bad; Barack Obama 51% good and 38% bad; and Donald Trump 51% and 36% bad.Biden has defiantly defended his pullout decision and said, attracting severe criticism, that the chaotic scenes unfolding at the Kabul airport were an inevitable outcome. He has also promised to stay in Afghanistan as long as it takes to get all Americans out of there, even beyond the pullout deadline of August 31.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabul-evacuation-among-most-difficult-in-history-biden-101629483906793.html
21-08-2021||World||‘Not without my staff’: Ex-British Royal marine who runs animal shelter in Afghanistan refuses to leave||With Afghan nationals making all possible desperate attempts to flee their country following the takeover by the Islamist extremist group Taliban, and foreign countries evacuating its embassy staff and other nationals, a former British Royal Marine who owns an animal sanctuary in Afghanistan has refused to follow suit. Paul ‘Pen’ Farthing said that he will not leave the war-torn country without his Afghan staff and their immediate family members.Farthing, who served in the Royal Marine for 22 years, set up the ‘Nowzad’ animal shelter in 2007 after his first rescue dog. Since then, he has formed a staff of 25 Afghan nationals that also include three of Afghanistan’s first female veterinarians.Farthing has demanded that his staff and their families be evacuated along with him and be accepted as refugees in the UK. In an interview to news agency Reuters, he said, “My staff don’t deserve the fate that awaits them if they stay here in Afghanistan.”The Taliban had prohibited women from working under their previous regime two decades ago, and had also disapproved of having dogs as pets.Farthing said that the sanctuary could face reprisals as it was funded by foreign aid. “I had an opportunity, the fact that I am a British citizen, I'm going to use that to full effect - so I've said I'm not going until my staff leave this country,” he was quoted as saying by Reuters.Soon after regaining control over Afghanistan, Taliban spokesperson, Zabihullah Mujahid, in a first press conference said that women will be allowed to study and work but according to the Islamic Law. ““Taliban are committed to providing women with their rights based on Islam. Women can work in the health sector and other sectors where they are needed. There will be no discrimination against women,” he stated, adding that women would be “happy within the framework of Sharia.”The extremist group has also said that non-governmental organisations (NGOs) will also be allowed to function in Afghanistan.Also Read | Embassies, aid organisations will be safe in Kabul: Taliban's MujahidFarthing pointed out that despite Taliban patrolling the streets of Kabul, and their behaviour not being “overly friendly,” there has been a feeling of calmness around his community. He highlighted that the most dangerous zone was near to the airport where scores of Afghan nationals are desperately trying to escape the country.“You've got the British and Americans inside and then outside you've got this throng of people; and then you have the Taliban checkpoints," Farthing said.Although the extremist group have projected a reformed outlook this time, assuring protection and rights to women and children, including allowing them to go to schools to and working, the scepticism around these promises is prominent on the global platform.Canada has already said that they will not accept the Taliban regime as the government of Afghanistan as they replaced an elected and democratic dispensation “by force.” Japan on Friday also noted that it is not considering recognising the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.Also Read | Canada polls: All parties say Taliban-led Afghan govt won’t be recognisedMeanwhile, reports have already surfaced of the extremist group torturing Afghan citizens, especially women and children.Los Angeles Times reporter Marcus Yam posted some of the pictures on Twitter on Wednesday and claimed that the insurgents opened fire to drive people away from the airport, leaving at least half a dozen people wounded, including a woman and her child. Other images and videos also claimed that the fighters were beating women and children while they were trying to flee the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exbritish-marine-who-runs-animal-shelter-refuses-to-leave-without-afghan-staff-101629480325199.html
21-08-2021||India||Hindu Army chief held over communal slogans at protest in Delhi||The Delhi Police have arrested Hindu Army chief Sushil Tiwari for allegedly raising anti-Muslim slogans during a protest at Jantar Mantar on August 8, people aware of the matter said on Saturday.Shortly after the incident in the national capital, when the police began cracking down on those who allegedly shouted hate remarks, Tiwari fled the city, a senior police officer said, asking not to be named. He was tracked down in Lucknow on Friday night and arrested, the officer said.Tiwari is a resident of Lucknow and came to Delhi with a group of at least five men to participate in the protest at Jantar Mantar, the officer said. The police said they have formed various teams to track the other men.Videos of anti-Muslim sloganeering during a protest at Jantar Mantar were widely circulated on social media, following which the Delhi Police registered a case in connection with the matter on Monday. Hundreds of people attended the protest organised by the “Bharat Jodo Aandolan” at Jantar Mantar on Sunday. Tiwari was seen shouting slogans in one of these videos, the police said.On being questioned after he was tracked down, Tiwari told the police he joined the protest after reading a message on a WhatsApp group. Tiwari works as a travel agent and often comes to Delhi for work, said the police.Six people, including advocate and former Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Ashwini Upadhyay, were previously arrested in the case. Upadhyay was granted bail on August 12. “Seven arrests in the case have been made and we are further investigating the matter,” said the police officer.HT tried to contact Upadhyay and the Hindu Army for comments on Saturday but their phones were switched off.The earlier arrests were made after an FIR was registered by a policeman posted at Jantar Mantar, at the Connaught Place police station. It pertained to provocative sloganeering at the programme. Besides Upadhyay, Preet Singh, Deepak Singh, Deepak Kumar, Vinod Sharma and Vinit Bajpai have been arrested, police said, adding that Tiwari is the seventh to be arrested in the case.Preet Singh is the director of ‘Save India Foundation’ while Deepak Singh, Deepak Kumar and Vinod Sharma are associated with different right-wing organisations.“They had previously decided to hold this protest in April, but due to the second wave of Covid-19, the plan was postponed till August and towards the end of July, a date for this protest was decided,” another official said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hindu-army-chief-held-over-communal-slogans-at-protest-in-delhi-101629570310573.html
21-08-2021||India||300 Indians set to return from Kabul||Close to 300 Indian nationals were expected to return home from Afghanistan by Sunday as part of the government’s elaborate efforts to speed up the evacuation of all citizens against the backdrop of the deteriorating situation at Kabul airport.More than 80 Indian nationals, flown in an Indian Air Force (IAF) transport aircraft from Kabul to the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe on Saturday, will return home in a special Air India flight that will reach New Delhi early on Sunday, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.More than 100 Indians were set to be flown out of Kabul to New Delhi in a C-17 heavy lift aircraft and they too are expected to reach home by Sunday, the people said.Another group of 100-odd Indians, most of them employees of firms from Western countries, had been flown in US and Nato aircraft to Doha. This group too will be brought back to India by Sunday, the people added.As reports emerged of Taliban fighters opening fire and using harsh methods to control thousands of people who have been converging on the Kabul airport, the US embassy issued a security alert advising American citizens to avoid travelling to the airport because of “potential security threats outside the gates”. The alert also asked Americans to “avoid airport gates at this time unless you receive individual instructions from a US government representative to do so”.Earlier on Saturday, there was confusion for several hours about the status of some 150 Indians who were to be evacuated following reports that they were rounded up by the Taliban near the Kabul airport.The development was first reported on the website of the Afghan media outlet Etilaatroz and its sister publication Kabul Now, which cited a source as saying that more than 150 people, most of them Indians, had been “abducted”. The outlets subsequently quoted a Taliban spokesman as rejecting the allegations of abduction.Etilaatroz also reported the Indians were safe and their passports were checked before they were sent to the airport.There was no official word from Indian side on the development. The government has kept all details of the evacuation of Indian nationals from Afghanistan under tight wraps because of operational and security reasons.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that there were problems when a group of more than 200 people, including around 70 Afghan nationals and the remainder Indians, came to Kabul airport in a convoy late on Friday. The Taliban, who are outside the airport, stopped the group, following which most of the Afghans reportedly escaped.The Afghan nationals included Sikhs and Hindus, and reports said the Taliban had said they would not be allowed to leave the country.The Indians were rounded up by the Taliban and taken to an unknown location close to the airport for further checks, the people said. Following inquiries and checking of documents such as passports, the group was sent back to the airport on Saturday afternoon, the people added.The development occurred after an Indian military aircraft evacuated more than 80 Indians from Kabul to Dushanbe. Another military aircraft was on standby at Dushanbe, which is being used as a transit point by the Indian Air Force because of the limited time slots available at Kabul airport, which is controlled by the US military.The people cited above said the biggest problem in the evacuation of Indians is the journey from different parts of the city to the airport as Kabul has been taken over by the Taliban, who have set up check posts across the capital. Adding to the worries of the Indian side are reports that terrorists from Pakistan-based groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Haqqani Network are also present among the Taliban.With the civilian side of Kabul airport still closed, all evacuations are being done from the military side, outside which thousands of Afghans have gathered in the hope of getting on board the flights being operated by countries such as the US and the UK. Numerous videos have emerged of Taliban fighters opening fire outside the airport to drive back crowds.India evacuated its envoy, diplomats, officials, security personnel and some nationals on two C-17 heavy lift aircraft on Monday and Tuesday. It is believed that more than 500 Indians are still in Afghanistan and the government is focused on their safe repatriation. A few hundred Afghan Sikhs and Hindus too will be brought to India.The Taliban marched into Kabul on August 15 after the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government. Most of the top leaders of the group, including Abdul Ghani Baradar, have returned to Afghanistan and are engaged in consultations of forming a government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/300-indians-set-to-return-from-kabul-101629569770558.html

21-08-2021||India||Amid festivals and relaxations, BMC likely to increase Covid-19 testing||With festivals round the corner beginning with Raksha Bandhan on Sunday and a set of relaxations implemented in the last 10 days, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) may soon increase the daily testing of samples for Covid-19. In the last two days, the BMC has conducted a dry run by doubling its number of testing to gauge the situation.Since the last two days, over 50,000 tests have been conducted in the city, the majority of which were done using rapid antigen kits. This is an increase from the daily 25,000 to 35,000 tests being conducted in the city until Wednesday. The BMC has said with relaxations and festivals round the corner, in the coming days the testing may be increased, if the need arises.According to BMC officials, more testing of samples also leads to detecting cases faster which also results in early tracing of infected citizens. As per predictions of experts and authorities, the third wave of Covid-19 cases is likely to kick in anytime between September or October, during the festive season.Suresh Kakani, Additional Municipal Commissioner of the BMC said, “In the last two days, we did a trial run by increasing our testing numbers to above 50,000. However, it will remain around 35,000 for now. But in the coming days depending on the situation, we may have to increase testing.”“However, when we increase our testing, major reliance will be on RT-PCR testing and rapid antigen tests equally. Ultimately, when we have to increase our testing, we will have to focus on places with high footfall. For instance, malls again depending on whether they are open or not, hawkers, shopkeepers. We will have to target those who have multiple layers of contact,” Kakani added. In Mumbai, overall, as of August 19, 2021, 740,290 cases have been detected by testing 8,855,005 samples. The overall positivity rate is 8.36% and the daily positivity rate is hovering between 0.50% to 1% in the last few days. In Mumbai, a total of 8,050,775 citizens have been traced as part of the contact tracing method for Covid-19. A total of 8,0171,766 have completed home quarantine and currently 32,256 are under home quarantine.According to BMC officials, along with more relaxations the instances of citizens self-testing has also increased in a few areas. This in a way adds up to the testing count and also results in early testing. Prashant Gaikwad, Assistant Municipal Commissioner of D Ward under whom the BMC’s jurisdiction areas like Malabar Hill, Tardeo fall said, “There are many areas in my ward where citizens are going outstation for work. On their return, they get tested and there are times even their family members get tested. This in a way helps in early testing and tracing of infected patients.”Dr Madhav Sathe, Retired Microbiology Professor at Nair Hospital in Mumbai said, “I do understand that there are less people willing to come up for testing but at the least we need 20,000 RT-PCR testing on a daily basis. Looking at the current relaxations and festivals coming up, we should at least have 40 to 50 thousand tests conducted in Mumbai of which 60% should be RT-PCR and 40% should be done through rapid antigen kits.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-festivals-and-relaxations-bmc-likely-to-increase-covid-19-testing-101629568330489.html
21-08-2021||India||4 special CBI teams may hold region-wise probe into post-poll violence in Bengal||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which has been directed by the Calcutta high court to probe cases of alleged murder, attempts to murder and rape reported during the post-poll violence in West Bengal, is likely to divide the entire state into four zones on the basis of the number of complaints received, people familiar with the matter said.Four special teams, comprising seven members each, are slated to arrive in the state next week to take charge of complaints from north, south, west and Kolkata zones, respectively, the people cited above said, adding that separate FIRs could be filed for each allegation of rape and murder.“Four special teams, each headed by a joint director, are likely to take up the investigations in each zone. For each allegation of rape and murder, separate FIR would be lodged instead of clubbing them into one complaint,” a CBI official said on condition of anonymity.The teams will be assisted by local officers from the agency’s Kolkata office and will be under the overall supervision of additional director Ajay Bhatnagar.The top five districts, from where the seven-member enquiry committee set up by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) received maximum number of complaints, were Cooch Behar, Birbhum, Kolkata North 24 Parganas, East Burdwan and South 24 Parganas.While Birbhum and East Burdwan, located in the western part of the state, received 314 and 113 complaints, respectively, Cooch Behar in north Bengal topped the list with 322 complaints. North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas in south Bengal received 196 and 203 complaints, respectively.At least 172 complaints were received from Kolkata.On Thursday, the Calcutta high court ordered separate probes by the CBI and a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the state police into the alleged violence. A five-judge bench headed by acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal said the CBI will probe the serious allegations of rape and murder and a three-member SIT those of arson and loot under the court’s supervision.The central agency on Friday sought details of all cases of alleged murder, attempt to murder and rape reported during the violence from the state police.While speculations are rife that the West Bengal government may challenge the high court order in the Supreme Court, two caveats by advocate Anindya Sundar Das and advocate Priyanka Tibrewal have already been filed in the apex court.Welcoming the high court order, Biswajit Sarkar, brother of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker Abhijit Sarkar who was allegedly murdered by Trinamool Congress workers in Kolkata on May 2, said: “The attackers had used wires to drag my brother. They had assaulted me too but my brother was their primary target. Hopefully I will get justice now.”In South 24 Parganas, one Sankar Adhikari recounted how his brother Haran Adhikari was killed near their house in Sonarpur on the same night.“The TMC had been threatening my brother for many days as he was a BJP supporter and used to chant Jai Shri Ram. He was attacked after the results were declared. His face was almost not recognizable. Hopefully all these would be probed, and the culprits would be hanged,” he said.The BJP has already released the names of 42 party workers, including Sarkar and Adhikari, who were allegedly killed in the post-poll violence.The TMC, however, has denied any post-poll incident after May 5, when chief minister Mamata Banerjee took oath for a second term.“We have been telling right from the beginning that there has been massive post poll violence. The NHRC report also said this. Now, the high court has said the same thing. The state has been denying this from the very beginning,” BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said.At Nanoor in Birbhum where allegations of a gang rape surfaced, police said that no such incidents had taken place.“There is absolute peace in the district. There has been no violence. The BJP is bringing false allegations. Let the CBI come and investigate,” TMC’s Birbhum district president Anubrata Mondol said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-special-cbi-teams-may-hold-region-wise-probe-into-post-poll-violence-in-bengal-101629567851074.html

While a probe is underway, Goa Police said that “prima facie”, it appeared to be a case of “death by hanging”.“We received information that she was blackmailed in 2019 for sexual favours and Chennai Police had registered an FIR in this regard. But this is preliminary information and we hope that the Goa Police will investigate the matter thoroughly and rule out any possible suspicion in her death,” counsel for the Russian Consulate Adv Vikram Varma .The FIR in Chennai was registered in 2019 after the woman accused a photographer of harassing her for sexual favours.In a separate incident, the body of another Russia woman - Ekaterina Titova - was recovered from her apartment in the village on the same day.“In both cases, we are following legal procedures... we have informed the embassy to appoint a representative and begun inquest proceedings.

The achievement comes a week after the state nearly touched the one million mark in a day on August 14, when it administered 964,460 doses in a single day.“Till 7pm, Maharashtra administered 10,96,493 (1.96 million) doses across 5,200 vaccination centres in the state. Our previous best was 9.64 lakh doses on August 14, 2021,” said Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health). He added that the numbers are expected to rise in the next few hours. According to the data on the CoWin portal, the state’s cumulative tally was 5,321,928, and so far, 14,012,636 citizens have been fully vaccinated in the state.State health minister Rajesh Tope lauded the efforts of the health workers and doctors across the state. “The health department officials and workers today have proved that we can administer over 10 lakh (1 million) doses in a day,” he said adding that the state has the infrastructural capabilities to go past this record as well.State tourism and environment minister Aaditya Thackeray in a tweet said, “As and when vaccines are received, our healthcare champions from public & private sector ensure max citizens are reached out to.”Earlier this month, Maharashtra went past the 50 million mark in total vaccines administered. The state stands second in the overall doses administered after Uttar Pradesh, which has administered over 63.1 million doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-sets-new-vax-record-administers-nearly-1-1-million-doses-in-1-day-101629564849869.html
21-08-2021||India||Never in our wildest dreams did we think Taliban would return so easily: ANA officer who trained at IMA||Two weeks ago, a young Afghan National Army (ANA) officer who pursued his pre-commission training at the Indian Military Academy (IMA) in Dehradun, was donning his uniform with pride, while on duty at a military base several miles away from Kabul. Little did he know that a week later, he would have to hide his uniform and all his identity cards to escape from the Taliban.The ANA officer has been moving to different towns since August 15, when the Taliban captured Kabul, to avoid getting caught. According to him, the Taliban are looking for ANA personnel and other people who worked for the erstwhile elected government of former President Ashraf Ghani.“We never thought in our wildest dreams that the Taliban would return so easily in just a few days. Our leaders sold us. Since the government was toppled and the top commanders surrendered, we hid our uniform and service weapons. We then went into hiding from the Taliban,” said the officer while talking to HT on a social media platform from an undisclosed town several miles away from capital Kabul.He said that like him many others from the ANA are in hiding to avoid getting caught by the hardline Islamists who ruled the war-torn country from 1996 to 2001 invoking an extreme form of Sharia law.“Like me, many others from the ANA are hiding in different places of the country. We are not scared at all, but only worried that they will take the country back to the period before 2001. We are waiting for the right time to rise against the Taliban who are still wild animals. We will not accept their rule,” said the officer.Nearly got caught by Taliban at a checkpointThe officer said that since August 15, he has been hiding in different towns to ensure his safety while worrying for his parents who live in the capital.“Initially, I was hiding for a couple of days in one of my relative’s house. There I had proper food as I was hungry for two days with nothing left to eat in my post. From there I left for one of my friend’s place a few kilometres away a day ago. It was then, that I encountered the Taliban at a checkpoint manned by them,” he said.“They stopped our car and using an expletive, asked us that from where we were coming and where we were going. For a moment we were worried, but we kept our cool and replied in a relaxed way to avoid any suspicion. Then they allowed us to go after a tense 3 minutes of questioning.”Narrating his escape, he said that “fortunately, I had grown my beard a few weeks ago.”“I started growing it weeks before the Taliban captured Kabul on August 15. It helped me pass the checkpoint along with my traditional attire of pathani suit which I donned after disposing my uniform,” said he officer adding he is “worried about his family”.‘Was shocked to see our weapons in the hands of the Taliban’The officer said he and his men hid their weapons including the American made M4 assault rifles before going into hiding while many others surrendered them to the Taliban.“At the checkpoint, where we were stopped, I was shocked to see our weapons in the hands of those men. I was thinking, do you even know how to hold it properly, how to open it and clean it? But that was the new reality we had to accept in Afghanistan. They got their hands on the modern weaponry provided to us by the Americans,” he said adding “we however don’t know what to do, till when to hide like this.”The ANA officer also vented his anger on the United States of America (USA) for their “abrupt exit all of a sudden”.“Wherever they have stepped in, they have destroyed that country. Now after destroying ours, they left it suddenly. We want to tell the people of other countries that never ever trust them. They only care about their vested interests,” he said while also expressing his anger on former President Ashraf Ghani who fled from the country.“After leaving the people of his country in this crisis, he had the guts to say in a video that he will return to Afghanistan to work for the people. If he returns, people will not spare him. How can someone leave his motherland and flee in such an hour of need?” he questioned.‘Will soon stand under Ahmad Massoud’Hoping for a turnaround in fortunes the young officer said, “The people of Afghanistan will soon stand up against the Taliban.”“We are lucky to still have leaders like Ahmad Massoud, son of legendary Ahmad Shah Massoud, who have vowed to stand up for the people of Afghanistan against Taliban in Panjshir Valley which is the only province free from the Taliban,” he said adding resistance has already started in Baghlan province.“There the locals recaptured three districts from the Taliban after they carried out a door-to-door search against their promise of general amnesty. That enraged the locals who then retaliated to capture the three districts from them. God willing, this will spread to other areas as well,” said the officer before signing off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/never-in-our-wildest-dreams-did-we-think-taliban-would-return-so-easily-ana-officer-who-trained-at-ima-101629563530186.html
21-08-2021||India||Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh dies at 89||Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister and former Rajasthan Governor Kalyan Singh passed away at Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Lucknow on Saturday, due to sepsis and multi-organ failure. The veteran leader was admitted to the hospital's intensive care unit on July 4 because of an infection and reduced consciousness level. On Friday, the hospital authorities informed that his health was critical and he was being moved on a life-saving support system.BJP leaders, including Union home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh visited the leader at the hospital this month. On Friday, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath paid a visit to the leader.Kalyan Singh, popularly known as 'Babuji', became the chief minister of the state for the first time in 1991. He was at the helm of the affairs in the state when the Babri masjid was demolished in 1992. In several interviews, he recounted what happened on December 6 and just before the bhumi pujan of the Ram temple in Ayodhya in August 2020, he said he wanted to be reborn in the temple town. "I was told that central forces were on way to the temple town but their movement was halted by kar sewaks outside Saket college. I was asked whether to order firing (on kar sewaks) or not. I denied permission in writing and said in my order, which is still there on the files, that firing would lead to the loss of many lives, chaos and law and order issues across the country," Kalyan Singh had told Hindustan Times in an interview.After a controversial first stint as the chief minister, Kalyan Singh became the CM once again in 1997 according to a power-sharing agreement between the BJP and the BSP. Even after the BSP withdrew its support from the government, he continued to be the CM as a faction of Congress extended support to the Kalyan Singh government. In 1998, the Kalyan Singh's government was dismissed by the Governor after a Congress faction withdrew its support.Kalyan Singh's association with the BJP had many ups and downs. An RSS member from school, Kalyan Singh was a member of Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the Janata Party and then the BJP. During his second stint as the chief minister, he was replaced as the chief minister and left the BJP to form a new party, the Rashtriya Kranti Party.In 2004, he returned to the BJP and again exited the party in 2009. In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, he won from Etah as an independent candidate. In 2010, he announced the formation of the Jan Kranti Party and four years later, he again came back to the BJP. In the same year, he was appointed the Governor of Rajasthan and completed his term in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-uttar-pradesh-chief-minister-kalyan-singh-dies-at-89-101629562799495.html

Addressing a gathering, the PDP chief said, “It needs courage to endure what people of Jammu and Kashmir are enduring. The day [people] run out of patience, everything will be doomed.”She also stressed not testing the patience of the people of Jammu and Kashmir and drew the example of the Taliban recapturing Afghanistan nearly two decades later. “See what is happening in our neighbourhood [Afghanistan]. Even the US, which is such a massive power, had to pack their bags and withdraw from the country,” Mufti added.Reiterating her demand to restore the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir, the PDP chief said discourse around the region and matters associated with it should be done similar to how BJP leader and late Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee had done. “There is still time; rectify yourself,” Mufti said while referring to the Centre.#WATCH | It needs courage to endure what people of J&K are enduring.

21-08-2021||India||India allowed two flights daily to evacuate people from Kabul: Report||India has been allowed by the US and NATO forces to operate two flights per day from Kabul to evacuate its nationals stranded in Afghanistan, government sources told news agency ANI. This will accelerate the evacuation process to which the government has reiterated its commitment. Countries are scrambling to evacuate their people after the Taliban captured Kabul on August 15. The Kabul airport which is being managed by the US and NATO forces has become a scene of disarray and chaos as the situation has taken an unexpected turn following the fall of Kabul.Reports said more than 300 Indian nationals have to be taken out of Kabul. Air India operated one of the very first evacuation flights to Kabul on August 15, before the air space was closed. The flight had to hover in the skies for almost an hour as it could not land.The Indian Air Force has already evacuated around 180 passengers, including its ambassador to Afghanistan and all other diplomats. The first aircraft of India was allowed to operate from Kabul after National Security Advisor Ajit Doval interacted with his US counterpart Jake Sullivan to facilitate the movement of Indian officials inside the American security zone at the airport, ANI reportedThe external affairs ministry said the main challenge in evacuation is the operational status of the Kabul airport. A day after the Taliban captured Kabul, the airspace was closed disrupting the evacuation process.But that did not deter India's evacuation process, Union civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said on Friday. "We operated flights to Kabul every day but after Afghanistan airspace's closure, Indian Air Force's C130 Hercules Globemaster aircraft flew to Kabul to bring back our citizens to the country. These flights are operating to bring back our people safely. Every day we are getting 130-150 Indians safely back to the country," he said."The Indian government will bring its citizens back to their homes from Afghanistan, as we did in the Vande Bharat Mission, through Air India and the Indian Air Force (IAF) planes, whichever way is possible. The evacuation process continued for three days. But, when a flight was about to take off on Sunday, NOTAM (a notice to alert aircraft pilots of potential hazards along a flight route) was received following gunshots fired at the Kabul airport," Scindia said earlier.The European Union has said the situation at the Kabul airport is very difficult and EU delegation members are there at the airport trying to help constantly. “It is a very difficult situation, it is changing by the minutes, but there is intense work being done to make the best of a very difficult situation," an EU official said. A senior US military official has told Reuters on Saturday that there have been short durations during the last 24 hours where gates of Kabul airport have been closed.The Taliban have claimed that they are not holding foreigners back and are aiming to improve the situation to provide a smooth exit at the airport over the weekend.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-allowed-two-flights-daily-to-evacuate-people-from-kabul-report-101629559665474.html
21-08-2021||India||Well deserved: Making our heroes feel special||The Tokyo 2020 Olympics were gripping and victorious for us Indians. For our country, it was the highest return since the 2012 London Games with seven medals. As a special reward to the hardwork and perseverance of India’s medal winners at the Games, many brands have come forward in celebration of these medallists and have been serenading them with gifts and goodies.It all began with the wish of the 26-year-old weightlifter Saikhom Mirabai Chanu who clinched the silver medal in women’s 59 kg category on the second day of the international sports event to celebrate her victory with a pizza. Within hours, Dominoes jumped into the fray with a lifetime offer of free Dominos pizzas for the champion.Shree Cements, the cements brand, also announced that the company will offer free cement to the medallists ‘in order to help them build their dream homes’.ISCKON temple, Dwarka has gone a notch higher and has made meals at the Govindas Restaurant free for lifetime for the gold, silver and bronze Olympic medalists and their families. Neeraj Chopra cinched gold, Weightlifter Mirabai Chanu and Boxer Ravi Kumar Dahiya bagged a silver and Badminton player PV Sindhu, Boxer Lovlina Borgohain, Wrestler Bajrang Punia and all the players of the men’s hockey team won Olympic bronze and they all deserve applause.Shri Hemant Kumar, associated with the management of Rukmini Dwarkadhish Mandir, ISKCON Dwarka, Delhi says, “Through this move, we are celebrating the will, determination, restraint and passion of players who made a mark on the global stage. We are also bestowing life membership of ISKCON on these players. An inspiration to other players, we welcome the real gems of the country to ISCKON Dwarka, Delhi.``These special gestures of honouring India’s talent will go a long way in encouraging other brands to invest in infrastructure needs of emerging sports persons and help in bridging the gap between India’s quest for sporting glory and the number of medals.To keep up the spirit of our national game, hockey, a Peer Commerce start-up, Rozana.in has announced a 75% discount for a year for the Indian women hockey team and their families coinciding with the 75th Year of India’s independence. They have taken this initiative to commemorate the undying determination and grit displayed by the Indian Women’s Hockey Team at Olympics.“These women are an inspiration for every sports person in the country. Team Rozana salutes the champions and this is just a small gesture to show our support and respect,” says Ankur Dahiya, co-founder, Rozana.in while announcing the initiative.Participation in the Olympics is a matter of national pride, says Sumit Israni, managing director, Geetanjali Salons & Studios and Celebrity Hair Stylist. He says, “Our representatives have given us hope, joy and a reason to feel proud. Though a small gesture, we are delighted to offer a flat 50% discount to all the Olympic winners. They can avail these services PAN India- in both our verticals - Geetanjali salon and Geetanjali studio till the next Olympics.”India has an expansive history of legal aid, backed by several decades of legislation, jurisprudential interpretation, and numerous state-funded programs. However, its pro bono culture is still very much a work in progress. Keeping this in mind, L&L Partners informed the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports that the firm will provide medal winners of the Indian contingent at the 2020 Olympics with pro-bono legal aid for a period of one year.Such gestures and long commitments would ensure better credibility for the brands. Let’s hope the players get their due from other corporate structures in the near future as well. In a country obsessed with cricket and the majority of brand endorsements bagged by cricketers, let’s pray that the focus shifts to other deserving sports and sportspersons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/well-deserved-making-our-heroes-feel-special-101629561129876.html
21-08-2021||India||'Don't have enough data...': Dr Randeep Guleria on if India needs booster shot of Covid-19 vaccine||Even as booster shot of coronavirus vaccine has been approved in some countries, including Israel and the United States, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Dr Randeep Guleria said on Saturday India “does not have enough data” right now to determine if a booster is needed in the country to increase protection against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). More information in this regard would be available "by early next year," Dr Guleria told NDTV.“I don’t think we have enough data right now, even for elderly and higher-risk groups, to say that a booster shot is needed. We really need to have some data to give us an idea of the level of protection that vaccines provide. Information is still emerging, possibly by early next year, we will have data on what type of booster shots are needed, and who all need it,” he said.For single-dose vaccines, the second dose represents the booster shot, while for two-dose vaccines, the third one will be the booster. A booster shot is administered only if required.Dr Guleria also emphasised that globally, as well as in India, people who have been vaccinated continue to be protected from severe Covid-19, adding that “there has not been a huge surge” in hospital admissions among such people. “Will the booster be needed from the vaccines available? Should we consider a new vaccine or the same one? Should vaccines be combined for the booster? These details are still emerging,” the senior doctor further said.India’s vaccination drive against Covid-19 began on January 16, and all citizens above the age of 18 are eligible to be inoculated. Covishield and Covaxin were the first two vaccines to receive emergency use authorisation (EUA), and both require two doses. Among other vaccines to be approved for use in India, both Sputnik V and mRNA-1273, also have two-dose regimen, while Johnson and Johnson’s jab requires a single dose. The latest vaccine to be given EUA here, ZyCoV-D, is the world’s first three-dose vaccine for Covid-19.Among these, Covaxin and ZyCoV-D are indigenously developed jabs. Till now, 576,117,350 vaccine doses have been administered in the country, including 3,636,043 in the last 24 hours, according to Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-have-enough-data-dr-randeep-guleria-on-if-india-needs-booster-shot-of-covid-19-vaccine-101629559477356.html

21-08-2021||India||Odisha forest dept suggests translocation of trees instead of felling for widening highways||Concerned over large-scale felling of trees due to expansion of highways in Odisha, the state forest department is expected to suggest to the national highway authorities that they go in for translocation of trees instead of cutting them down.Odisha principal chief conservator of forests Sisir Ratho said the forest department would soon request the NHAI to consider translocation of trees, which can survive during transportation, instead of felling them. Trees like Banyan, Peepal and Ashok can be saved through translocation. If the technique succeeds in saving trees along the highways, it can be implemented in cities and other locations at a later stage,” Ratho said.Earlier this year, Odisha forest and environment minister Bikram Keshari Arukh told the state assembly that 18.5 million trees were cut between 2010 and 2020 for widening of national highways such as the Sambalpur-Chhatisgarh section of NH-6, four-laning of Bhubaneswar-Puri road, Panikoili-Remuli section and Remuli Rajamunda section. However, just about 2.98 million trees were planted in place of the felled trees, just about 16 per cent of the trees that were cut down. More tree felling is on the cards after Union minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari in February this year approved 3 six-lane projects in the state.Earlier, environmentalists in the state had expressed concern over felling of 1,720 full-grown and old trees of different species for the widening of a 40 kilometre stretch of the National Highway 59 in Ganjam district. The ₹126-crore project is aimed at widening the road to 12 metres from 7 metres between Ratanpur near Berhampur city and Mundamarai near Aska.Project director of NHAI in Odisha, Ramprasad Panda said though the agency has not done any translocation of grown trees during highway expansion in the state, it would try to do it. “But there are several issues as not all trees can be relocated. We don’t have the expertise. It has to be done by OFDC or some forest agency. Besides, very old trees can’t be relocated. Another issue is getting the necessary space for planting of the same after relocation. But we would definitely try for relocation of trees as much as possible,” Panda said.Badri Lal Chaudhary, a botanist from Rajasthan who has reportedly moved more than 10,000 trees across the country and outside over last 18 years said there is need for tree relocation due to the declining green cover.“As cities are rapidly losing forest cover, we have to take steps to save each and every full-grown tree. Peepal and Banyan trees should be saved as they have sentimental value. Translocation can take a day to a week depending on the species and physical conditions like climate, temperature, soil conditions have to be accounted for before translocation,” he said.Recently, the Central Public Works Department in Delhi had proposed to transplant over 1,800 trees inside the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts complex, as part of the Central Vista redevelopment project.However, Odisha-based environmentalist Biswajit Mohanty said translocation is not a feasible idea as not every tree can be replanted. “A tree cannot be transplanted just by simply uprooting it and placing it in a pit somewhere else. The process involves several steps and requires significant expertise. The entire cost of transplanting any tree depends on its age, weight and distance to be shifted. The older a tree is, larger is its weight and harder is it to treat its root anatomy. Any tree which is older than 20 years is difficult to translocate. The translocation has to be done not very far from the place where it originally grew. As the survival of transplanted trees is around 10 per cent, we have been suggesting that before expansion of national highways, let the officials first plant trees just around the place where the expanded project will end. This should be done at least 3 years before the actual work happens. If those planted trees survive, then the authorities can cut down the existing trees for expansion,” said Mohanty.Mumbai-based naturalist Shardul Bajikar also expressed doubts whether tree transplantation can work in India. “It is a very sensitive process and I don’t know if proper procedures are followed in India. Various precautions need to be taken after tree transplantation. The survival rate of trees that are transplanted in India is well below 10 per cent,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-forest-dept-suggests-translocation-of-trees-instead-of-felling-for-widening-highways-101629559209386.html

Company’s MD hopes to start trials ‘very soon’||The Zydus Group on Saturday said that the company would soon apply to the Indian drug regulator for their approval to conduct trials of ZyCoV-D on children above 2 years of age. The announcement came a day after the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) approved the drug for emergency use authorisation against Covid-19 for children and adults above 12 years of age.“In the younger age group, we have not started them yet. We are working now with the regulators to work on a program to do a study for the younger age group as well. We will be applying for trials in one-two week to start the trials. But we hope that we can conduct trials on them very soon,” news agency ANI quoted Dr Sharvil Patel, managing director of the Zydus Group, as saying on Saturday evening.ZyCov-D became the sixth vaccine to be approved in India. The medicine is “the world’s first and India’s indigenously developed DNA-based vaccine for Covid-19 to be administered in humans including children and adults 12 years and above,” news agency PTI quoted the government’s Department of Biotechnology as saying.Also read | Zydus Cadila says will begin supply of its Covid-19 vaccine in mid-SeptemberWhile the approval of the vaccine came as a shot in the arm to the country’s immunisation programme against the disease, its phase 3 trials data is yet to be published by the company.Dr Patel said that the company might take another four or five months to publish the results fully. “So, the full phase 3 data will show not only the efficacy of the vaccine but also the safety and long-term immunogenicity details which is at least followed up for the next 3-6 months. So, for the full report to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, it will take at least four to five months,” ANI quoted him as saying.When asked about the trials conducted so far on adults, he said, “Trials have been conducted at 50 centres across the country. I am not aware of centres for only children. Overall the trials on 28,000 volunteers have been conducted at 50 centres. We have conducted the trials on 1,400 children in the 12-18 years age group,” ANI further reported.Further, he also said that no severe side effects were observed in the 12 to 18 age group. “In the age group of 12-18 years and adults, we have not seen severe side effects related to the vaccine.

Reports said before joining the Taliban, he was in the Afghan army and was trained as a foreign cadet at the Indian Military Academy.ALSO WATCH | The Taliban leader who once trained at Indian Military Academy: Stanikzai aka SheruAs per sources, quoted by news agency ANI, Mohammad Abbas had joined the Afghan National Army as a Lieutenant after passing out in 1982, after completing his training at the IMA. He was selected for training at IMA after passing the examination of the Afghan Defense Academy.Popularly called 'Sheru' by his then batchmates, Mohammad Abbas was among the 45 cadets who received training in the Keran Company of the Bhagat Battalion of the academy. Many cadets from African and Asian countries have received "pre-commission training" at the Indian Military Academy since 1948.Taliban wanted India to retain its diplomatic presence in AfghanistanBorn in Logar Province, Mohammad Abbas studied political science in Afghanistan and completed his masters before joining the military. He fought in the Soviet-Afghan war and when the Taliban came to power in 1996, he became the deputy minister of foreign affairs under foreign minister Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil. Being one of the top Taliban leaders, he was also at the helm of affairs in the last two decades when the Taliban was operating from its political office in Qatar.A Bloomberg report said unlike many of the Taliban leaders, Stanikzai speaks fluent English. In 1996, he had visited Washington to convince the Clinton administration to recognise the Taliban government. The mission failed but he remained a go-to man when it came to lead Taliban delegations in other countries. He led many Taliban delegations to foreign countries between 2012 and 2018. He is also Abdul Hakim Haqqani's deputy negotiator on talks with Afghan government officials.Reports have quoted Mohammad Abbas's batchmates saying that when he was in Dehradun, he was not at all a hardliner and was quite a likeable person.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-is-taliban-leader-sheru-once-trained-at-dehradun-s-military-academy-101629557131660.html

21-08-2021||India||Confusion over Indian evacuees’ status, reports suggest Taliban rounded them up||Confusion surrounded the status of some 150 Indians who were to be evacuated from Afghanistan following reports that they had been rounded up by the Taliban near Kabul airport on Saturday, hours after a military aircraft flew out another 80-odd Indians to Tajikistan.The development was first reported on the website of the Afghan media outlet Etilaatroz and its sister publication Kabul Now, which cited a source as saying that more than 150 people, most of them Indians, had been “abducted”. The outlets subsequently quoted a Taliban spokesman as rejecting the allegations of abduction.Etilaatroz also reported the Indians were safe and their passports were being checked before they were sent to the airport.There was no official word from Indian officials on the development. The government has kept all details of the evacuation of Indian nationals from Afghanistan under tight wraps because of operational and security reasons.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that there were problems when a group of more than 200 people, including around 70 Afghan nationals and the remainder Indians, came to Kabul airport in a convoy late on Friday. The Taliban, who are outside the airport, stopped the group, following which most of the Afghans reportedly escaped.The Indians were rounded up by the Taliban and taken to some unknown location close to the airport for further checks, the people said. Following inquiries and checking of documents such as passports, the group was sent back to the airport on Saturday afternoon, the people added.The development occurred after an Indian military aircraft evacuated some 80 Indians from Kabul to the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe. Another military aircraft is reportedly on standby at Dushanbe, which is being used as a transit point by the Indian Air Force because of the limited time slots available at Kabul airport, which is controlled by the US military.The people cited above said the biggest problem in the evacuation of Indians is the journey from different parts of the city to the airport as Kabul has been taken over by the Taliban, who have set up check posts across the capital. Adding to the worries of the Indian side are reports that terrorists from Pakistan-based groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Haqqani Network are also present among the Taliban.With the civilian side of Kabul airport still closed, all evacuations are being done from the military side, outside which thousands of Afghans have gathered in the hope of getting on board the flights being operated by countries such as the US and the UK. Numerous videos have emerged of Taliban fighters opening fire outside the airport to drive back people.India evacuated its envoy, diplomats, officials, security personnel and some nationals on two C-17 heavy lift aircraft on Monday and Tuesday. It is believed more than 500 Indians are still in Afghanistan and the government is focused on their safe repatriation. A few hundred Afghan Sikhs and Hindus too will be repatriated to India.The Taliban marched into Kabul on August 15 after the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government. Most of the top leaders of the group, including Abdul Ghani Baradar, have returned to Afghanistan and are engaged in consultations of forming a government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/confusion-over-status-of-indian-evacuees-as-reports-suggest-taliban-rounded-them-up-101629535628008.html

21-08-2021||India||Why no mention of Article 370 at Opposition leaders meet, asks ex-J&K minister||Former Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) minister Sajad Lone has questioned the justification of the presence of representatives from the region at a meeting of Opposition leaders on Friday if they could not convince them to talk about Constitution’s nullified Article 370. In a series of tweets on Saturday, he referred to the presence of National Conference (NC) chief Farooq Abdullah and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader at the meeting and added they became part of the “process that abandons Article 370” in its discourse.Lone pointed out there was no mention of Article 370, which was nullified in 2019 to strip J&K of its special status, at the meeting even as the Opposition parties sought early elections and restoration of the statehood for the region. “No mention of Article 370 in opposition parties meet. In wonderment how can J and K leaders justify their presence in the meeting if they could not convince the leaders to talk about 370. BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) anti 370’stance is clear. What is the national opposition stance,” tweeted Lone.Leaders of 19 parties met virtually on Friday as part of efforts to build unity ahead of the 2024 national elections.Lone said Parliament or courts can restore Article 370. “Courts we have to wait. It is a long process. In parliament we know BJP won’t restore it. The quietude of opposition parties suggest they won’t either. Then who will,” he said in another tweet. He added J&K’s leadership should seek “national support” for the restoration of Article 370. “For heavens sake. Let us at least resolve that if we can’t facilitate we will not impede either. Leaders from j and k should either get the national opposition endorse demand for 370 so that at the national level there is some hope at a future date or just keep out of it.”He said J&K leaders became a part of a national opposition that abandons Article 370 and irked the ruling party, which is not known for tolerance and hence puts even statehood at risk.Lone’s People’s Conference last year quit an alliance that was formed for the restoration of J&K’s special status. The alliance includes NC and PDP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-no-mention-of-article-370-at-opposition-leaders-meet-asks-ex-j-k-minister-101629530887803.html

In addition to this, the 'Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Bhoomheen Krishi Mazdoor Nyay Yojana' is being started to provide financial help to landless agricultural laborers residing in the rural areas of Chhattisgarh.Under this scheme, ₹6,000 will be provided annually to such families of rural areas who do not have agricultural land and are associated with MNREGA or agricultural wages.Under the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana, an amount totalling more than ₹5,600 crore in the financial year 2020-21 is being given to about 21 lakh farmers of Chattisgarh in four installments as crop production incentive input assistance to paddy and sugarcane growing farmers. An amount of ₹1,525 crore and 97 lakh has already been paid to the farmers as the first installment in their accounts, the government said. The second installment of ₹1,522 crore and 3 lakh was transferred to the bank accounts of the farmers under the scheme on the birth anniversary of Rajiv Gandhi.Notably, the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana was implemented in 2020 with the objective of providing a fair price to the farmers for their produce, promoting the productivity of Kharif crops and crop diversification, but with a retrospective effect, its benefits beginning from the Kharif marketing year. In the 2019-20 financial session, a provision was made to give the amount to the farmers selling paddy on support price, and ₹5,628 crore was provided in this regard.This year as well, the process of giving input assistance to farmers under this scheme is going on, the Chhattisgarh government said. According to the official release, it is to this end that the amount of ₹1,522 crore and 3 lakh was transferred to paddy and sugarcane farmers as the second installment on August 20.With the help of the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana, agriculture has been encouraged in Chattisgarh, the state government said. In the past two and a half years, the number of farmers has increased from 15 lakh to 22 lakh and the area under paddy cultivation has increased from 22 lakh hectares to more than 27 lakh hectares. According to the government, people who have turned away from agriculture have also started joining agriculture again.Under the 'GodhanNyay' scheme of the Chhattisgarh government, ₹1 crore was provided to cattle owners and villagers on August 20 as the 26th installment for the plan. Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel also authorised the payment of ₹1 crore 3 lakhs as a dividend to the self-help groups and Gauthan committees. It is worth mentioning here that under the GodhanNyay Yojana, which started in the state from July 20 last year, cow dung worth ₹99 crore and 8 lakh has so far been purchased.This amount is mostly contributed by cow dung sellers, cattle farmers, villagers, people belonging to backward classes, scheduled castes, and tribes, the government said. Around 45 per cent of the benefitted cow dung sellers are women, the release noted, adding that more than 78 thousand people among the beneficiaries belong to landless families. Of the amount directly transferred to the bank accounts so far, ₹18 crore and 49 lakh have been paid to self-help groups associated with Gauthans, and ₹26 crore 75 lakhs have been paid to Gauthan committees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-govt-paid-rs-1-522-crore-to-farmers-on-rajiv-gandhi-s-birth-anniversary-101629523308266.html

The crime sparked massive outrage in several parts of the country, with the media calling the subsequent killing of the four accused in police custody as 'Disha encounter'.The Justice Sirpurkar Commission was constituted by the Supreme Court to investigate the allegations of extrajudicial killings by the Cyberabad Police. According to reports, the committee finished collecting records in the case earlier this week and has now moved on to the evidence recording phase. Owing to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) situation, the panel is conducting its proceedings in a hybrid manner, issuing summons for physical presence wherever necessary. It has also held 16 virtual hearings and passed orders in 24 applications filed by the police so far.Disha, the name given by the police to the victim to protect her identity, was a veterinary assistant surgeon at a state-run hospital when she was attacked one night by the four men, according to confessions recorded by the police. The four men raped and smothered Disha to death and then loaded her body into a truck and burned it under a bridge later that night. With the incident sparking nationwide outrage, the Telangana police came under pressure to deliver punishment without delay on the basis of a fast-track court trial.All four accused in the Disha gang rape-and-murder were killed while in police custody on December 6, 2019, under a bridge on the Bengaluru-Hyderabad national highway. According to the police, the accused allegedly snatched guns and attacked police officers. In the ensuing gunfight, all the four accused were shot dead, said the Cyberabad Police. Although the 'Disha encounter' was viewed by many as an instance of extrajudicial execution, thousands across the country celebrated the 'swift justice' in the form of the death of the accused.The Justice Sirpurkar Commission issued a press release earlier this week, saying that witnesses have to be examined in physical presence "considering the gravity of the issue under inquiry and the sensitive nature of the evidence". In connection with this, the Supreme Court-appointed panel ordered the Telangana government to present its evidence before the commission in the high court building at 11:30am on August 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disha-encounter-case-telangana-govt-to-present-evidence-to-supreme-court-appointed-panel-today-101629504586093.html

Before the pandemic arrived, the Taj Mahal grounds used to remain open from 6am to 7pm on weekdays, except on Fridays when the complex was kept open for prayers at the mosque between 12pm to 2pm. Night viewing was allowed on the day of the full moon and two days before and after, excluding Fridays and the month of Ramadan.Dates and timingsNow, after more than one year of Covid-19 curbs, the Taj Mahal is set to reopen once again for night viewing, albeit with modified timings. According to the Archeological Survey of India's (ASI's) superintending archaeologist (Agra Circle) Vasant Kumar Swarnkar, the Taj Mahal will now remain open for night viewing on August 21, 23, and 24. The mausoleum will be closed every week on Friday, while the Covid-19 lockdown remains in effect as usual on Sunday.Taj Mahal will remain open for the tourists for night viewing on three separate time slots --> 8:30pm - 9pm> 9pm - 9:30pm> 9:30pm - 10pmGuidelinesTourists visiting the Taj Mahal for night viewing will be allowed to enter in batches of 50 people per slot, as per the guidelines of the Supreme Court. The tickets can be booked one day in advance from the office counter of the ASI on 22 Mall Road in Agra, said Swarnkar.Rajeev Saxena, vice-president of the Tourism Guild of Agra, said it was a good step, but it would not attract weekend travellers until the restriction of lockdown on Sunday and curfew after 10 pm was not lifted. "Tourists want to enjoy the nightlife of the city, they don't want to be packed in their hotels after 10 pm," he said.A government-approved tour guide, Monika Sharma, appreciated the move and said it was a ray of hope for the revival of Agra's tourism sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taj-mahal-to-reopen-for-night-viewing-from-today-check-slot-timings-here-101629502799004.html
21-08-2021||India||Will complacency on demand hurt revival?||India’s benchmark stock market index, BSE Sensex, breached yet another psychological milestone, crossing the 55,000-mark on August 13. This has come at the middle of the second quarter of the current fiscal year. Stock markets, provided they are not thriving on a bubble, are supposed to reflect future optimism (or lack of it) about an economy. The Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) crossed the psychological threshold of 100 in the week ending August 15. A NIBRI value of 100 refers to pre-pandemic levels of economic activity. This suggests that the present state of economic activity is coming close, or has even surpassed pre-pandemic levels.So, has the Indian economy finally shed its pandemic hangover? The answer to this question is less encouraging when we look at other recently released macroeconomic indicators. In fact, they underline the importance of focusing on revival of mass demand in the economy.Poor demand outlook will continue to suppress ‘animal spirits’Addressing members of the Confederation of Indian Industries on August 12, revenue secretary Tarun Bajaj asked why private investment was subdued despite impressive corporate performance (in terms of profits). Private capital makes investments only when it expects to make profits. Profits are a function of sales, which in turn is a function of demand. Investment, unless it is being made on account of depreciation of existing plant and machinery (or capital stock), is only justified when existing production capacity is deemed inadequate to cater to current or future demand. It is this constraint, not some ulterior motive, which is holding back private business from making investments.The latest round of RBI’s Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS) offers clinching evidence on this count. One of the questions in the survey asks respondents about the assessment of adequacy (or lack of it) of production capacity at the time of the survey and expected situation in the next six months. The statistic which stands out in the survey findings is not the assessment about current adequacy of production capacity but the future assessment about it. An unprecedented 28.4% of the respondents believed that their existing production capacity is more than adequate for the second quarter (July-September) of 2021-22. The latest IOS round was carried out between April and June. What is remarkable about the perception about future production capacity being more than adequate is that it has increased significantly compared to the first lockdown and the subsequent first wave of Covid-19 infections, which peaked in September 2020. This could be a reflection of delayed realisation of demand side damage to the economy.June quarter IIP numbers highlight damage to discretionary demandSome of the sequential economic recovery after a pandemic-like shock is inherent, as things will come back to normal. For example, people will go for haircuts and children will buy school uniforms once restrictions are eased. This is often described as pent-up demand. What matters for a sustained recovery, however, is whether there is any damage to what is often referred to as discretionary demand. This can happen when consumers, facing a current and future squeeze on their incomes, start cutting back on various kinds of non-essential spending. A new car or television, a family vacation etc. would fit in this category.Evidence from the June quarter Index of Industrial Production (IIP) numbers suggest that this seems to be happening in the Indian economy. The IIP index in the June 2021 quarter was lower than the June 2019 value, which means that industrial activity has not returned to pre-pandemic levels. A comparison of different components of the IIP for the June 2021 quarter with their corresponding values in the June 2019 quarter supports the argument around discretionary demand being weaker.At the use-based level, capital goods (lack of investment demand) and consumer durables (lack of discretionary demand) show the biggest deficit vis-a-vis pre-pandemic levels. Consumer non-durables, on the other hand, show the smallest contraction. At the industry level, the only three industries which had recovered to pre-pandemic levels in the June 2021 quarter were manufacture of food products, pharmaceuticals and basic metals, all of which are essential in nature. Transport equipment, furniture, motor vehicles etc. show the biggest deficit on this count.A ‘terms of trade’ shock to rural demand could be on the wayAgriculture was the only silver lining in the economy in the last fiscal year. Barring any unforeseen climate shocks, agricultural production should continue to grow in 2021-22 as well. However, agriculture’s contribution to overall demand in the economy is also contingent on what is described as ‘terms of trade’ or relative prices of farm and non-farm goods in the economy. If prices of non-farm goods are rising at a faster pace than farm-products, then farmers will face a squeeze on their purchasing power, which will generate headwinds for overall demand.Given the fact that it is non-food inflation which seems to be driving headline inflation numbers at the moment, a ‘terms of trade’ shock to farm incomes and therefore rural demand cannot be ruled out. To be sure, headline numbers for food and non-food inflation underestimate the possibility of such a situation, because food inflation has been elevated by prices of commodities such as edible oils, pulses and meat products. Prices of cereals and vegetables, which account for almost half of the value of crop production in the country, have actually been contracting for six months now. This is not good news for incomes for majority of farmers in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-complacency-on-demand-hurt-revival-101629493889900.html
21-08-2021||India||Zydus vaccine given govt panel approval||India’s drugs regulator approved a coronavirus vaccine by Zydus Cadila for anyone aged 12 and above, clearing the first shot for use in children and adding a sixth inoculation in India’s toolbox to fight the pandemic.The approval was given by Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO) after its experts assessed results from the company’s phase III clinical trials that showed the vaccine to have an efficacy of 66.6%. Officials said it can be rolled out to those under the age of 18 once the inoculation drive is officially expanded to cover children – at present, it is only for adults.“India is fighting Covid-19 with full vigour. The approval for world’s first DNA based ‘ZyCov-D’ vaccine of @ZydusUniverse is a testimony to the innovative zeal of India’s scientists. A momentous feat indeed,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted on Friday.The company confirmed the approval and said it has already stockpiled doses. “…the company has received the emergency use authorisation… for ZyCoV-D the world’s first plasmid DNA vaccine for Covid-19. ZyCoV-D is a three-dose vaccine which will be administered first on day zero, day 28th and then on the 56th day. With this approval, India now has its first COVID-19 vaccine for the adolescents in the 12-18 age group…,” the company said.It said the vaccine is delivered via a “painless” intradermal applicator and added that it plans to seek approval for a two-dose regimen of the vaccine. “The main advantage of DNA vaccines is their ability to stimulate both the humoral and cellular arms of the adaptive immune system. They are a valuable form of antigen-specific immunotherapy, as they are safe, stable and can be easily produced,” the company said.An official, who asked not to be named, said the expert panel sought more data to allow the company’s existing request to approve it as a two-dose shot.A second government official, who asked not to be named, said final approval to roll-out the vaccine to children above the age of 12 will be taken by government’s expert committees on vaccination. “The emergency use approval has come for the Zydus vaccine for use in 12 year olds and above but it will be the call of the experts on panels such as NTAGI (National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation) and NEGVAC (National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19), who decide on Covid-19 vaccine-related matters, whether to allow Covid-19 vaccination in children; and when. Even if the experts allow it, orders will have to be placed -- there is an entire procurement process that needs to be followed. Regulatory approval is just a part of the process,” this person said.ZyCoV-D was developed in partnership with the government’s Department of Biotechnology under the ‘Mission COVID Suraksha’, which involved the pooling of resources by several Indian research institutions for development and clinical trials.The vaccine works by instructing cells to produce the spike protein of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which elicits an immune response, the ministry of science and technology said in a statement on Friday.“It is a matter of great pride that today we have the EUA for the world’s first DNA COVID-19 vaccine ZyCoV-D by Zydus developed in partnership with the Department of Biotechnology and supported through Mission COVID Suraksha. The Indian Vaccine Mission COVID Suraksha was launched under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat package 3.0 being implemented by BIRAC, is aimed at the development of safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccines for public health,” said Dr Renu Swarup, secretary, department of biotechnology, and chairperson, Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council.“We are confident that this will be an important vaccine for both India and the world. This is an important milestone in our indigenous vaccine development mission and positions India on the global map for novel vaccine development,” she added.There are two vaccine candidates that have been tested among children in India: Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D. The two are also the only ones of the six now approved in India to be developed indigenously.The Covaxin trial data in children is still not out, while Zydus Cadila submitted the data to the national drugs regulator along with data from trials held in adult participants on July 1.The safety and tolerability data of children that was submitted to the regulator for scrutiny showed the tolerability profile was similar to that seen in the adult population, said the company’s managing director, Sharvil Patel, in a press briefing last month.Patel, last month announced that the company should have a production capacity of about 10-12 million doses per month.He added that the plug and play technology on which the plasmid DNA platform is based is ideally suited for dealing with Covid-19 as it can be easily adapted to deal with mutations in the virus, such as those already occurring.The pricing was not discussed as yet but Patel said it would be decided once the regulatory approvals came in as it would depend on doses, technology etc.“We are extremely happy that our efforts to put out a safe, well tolerated and efficacious vaccine to fight COVID-19 has become a reality with ZyCoV-D. To create the world’s first DNA vaccine at such a crucial juncture and despite all the challenges, is a tribute to the Indian research scientists and their spirit of innovation,” said Pankaj R Patel, chairman, Zydus group.ZyCoV-D is now the sixth vaccine approved in India for emergency use after Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, Russian-made Sputnik V, and the American vaccines— Moderna and Johnson and Johnson (J&J).Meanwhile, American pharma giant Johnson & Johnson (J&J) has sought approval from India’s drugs regulator to conduct clinical trials of its Covid-19 vaccine for the people in the 12-17 age group.“On 17 August 2021, we submitted an application to the CDSCO to conduct a study of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine in India in adolescents aged 12-17 years,” said a J&J India spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zydus-vaccine-given-govt-panel-approval-101629492759586.html

The company takes action against content if it violates its community standards or upon receiving a valid legal request under Indian laws.“In this case, the family has pleaded for their safety in court. In view of their safety and to maintain the dignity of the victim, we have decided to take down the content from our platform,” a person familiar with the matter said.The Wayanad MP had on August 4 tweeted a photograph of his meeting with the family of the victim, after which there was a complaint against him filed by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR). His Twitter account was locked for a few days and the controversial tweet withheld even as the BJP accused him and his party of politicising the matter.On the same day, Gandhi shared a video on Instagram and posted on Facebook pictures of the family. While NCPCR’s notice to Facebook was only regarding the Instagram post, the company has also proactively removed the Facebook post.Meanwhile, Twitter unlocked Gandhi’s account on August 14 after he submitted a consent letter by the parents of the victim, authorising him to use the image. A day earlier, on August 13, the victim’s family was heard telling news media that they had no objection to Gandhi sharing their photograph on social media as he did that in good faith.But on Tuesday, the mother of the victim said something different to news channel Times Now. “We have not given consent to share the photos or reveal her (the victim) identity to anyone except the court,” the mother said.The BJP on Tuesday launched an attack on Gandhi, calling him “insensitive”, and demanded that his Twitter account be locked again. “Rahul Gandhi has lost credibility and is a habitual liar. The public has locked his political account, now Twitter should also lock his account,” party spokesperson Sambit Patra said.Suresh Chaudhary, a lawyer representing the victim’s parents, said his clients hold a “neutral position” on the issue of sharing their images. “My clients have told me that they neither gave any written consent (to share their photograph), nor have they submitted any complaint in this connection,” Chaudhary told HT on August 17.There was no comment by the Congress on the action by the Facebook.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-takes-down-rahul-gandhi-s-post-on-rape-victim-s-family-101629491303490.html
21-08-2021||India||Only 25% districts achieved zero malaria cases by ’20: Report||Only a fourth of the 448 districts have been able to achieve zero malaria cases by 2020 as per the National Strategic Plan for Malaria Elimination, a report by the non-profit Malaria No More-India has revealed.India was among the 18 global leaders who pledged to end malaria by 2030 in the East Asia Summit held in Malaysia in 2015. However, so far, only 116 of the total 448 districts have reported zero malaria cases in 2020, and an additional 215 districts have reported less than 10 cases, the report said.The National Strategic Plan for Malaria Elimination (2017-22) was launched by the health ministry in July 2017, which laid down strategies for the next five years.Under the plan, 448 districts that reported one case per 1,000 population a year fell under Category 1, while 48 that reported between 1 and 2 cases per 1,000 population a year fell under Category 2. All these districts were to achieve zero malaria cases by 2022.According to the report, the country has recorded an 85% decline in the number of malaria cases since 2015. Of this, the Category 1 districts have recorded an 89% reduction, while Category 2 recorded 68%. The report further pointed to 34 states and 676 districts, which reported less than 1 malaria case per 1,000 population in 2020.Odisha had the highest burden, contributing over 30% of the country’s cases. It also saw the maximum decline in infections.“This, however, does not imply that 676 of the 678 districts initially considered in the National Strategic Plan have achieved less than 1 malaria case. The number of districts that provide malaria data has gone up since. Also, due to the pandemic last year, there was a 32% reduction in malaria testing; the surge in Covid-19 and the lockdown happened during the peak malaria season. We have to factor these; if we are targeting elimination we cannot be satisfied with fewer tests,” said Dr Kaushik Sarkar, director, Malaria No More-India.The states that currently need to focus on reducing the malaria burden are Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Mizoram, and Chattisgarh, said the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-25-districts-achieved-zero-malaria-cases-by-20-report-101629488916911.html

Imports have stopped over the last couple of weeks and whatever little is available is now being sold at exorbitant prices.The unani (also known as Arabian medicine) pharmacists get raw materials like mulethi (licorice), wormwood, jujube, akarkara (Anacyclus pyrethrum), dried plum, zaffron, raw hing (asafoetida), pure honey and solo garlic from Afghanistan.“Hing is used in making digestive syrups and tablets. These days medicine for cough and cold is high in demand. Raw materials used for making it are pure honey and mulethi (licorice) which has become scarce due to the crisis in Afghanistan,” said Hamin Ansari, a pharmacist.Now they will be forced to procure honey and mulethi from Punjab, which is of lesser quality. Due to the ongoing crisis in Afghanistan, prices of each and every herbal medicine have seen an upward trend by around 5% to 8 %. “If the situation does not improve, another steep price hike and even some shortage cannot be ruled out. We hope that the situation will improve in a few weeks,” said Ahmed Khan, a herbal store owner.The situation is similar for the dry fruit traders as they panic over the stranded import of items. Afghanistan exports dry fruits including dried raisins (kishmish), walnut (akhrot), fig (anjeer), pine nut (chilgoza), pistachios, dried apricot (qubani), almonds, cashew, spices and medicinal herbs. It is the only source of apricot and dried fig. “In the last two weeks, there has been about a 50% hike in the price of dry fruits. Almonds are now being sold at ₹600 per kg. It was sold at ₹400 sometime ago. Price of pistachio has been hiked by ₹100 per kg and figs by ₹200 per kg,” said Kapil, owner of the popular dry fruit store Kashmir House.Traders lament that trading has completely stopped in the last 15 days. “Usually, Afghan commodities reach India through the sea route through Mumbai. Some containers are sent via land route, through Pakistan which reach Amritsar, and will then be supplied from Delhi. We are looking forward to the government to resolve the issue as customers are becoming choosy,” Kapil added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghan-crisis-hits-herbal-dry-fruit-markets-in-hyderabad-as-import-stops-101629488527077.html
21-08-2021||India||Telangana, Andhra now at odds over fishing in 2 rivers||Hyderabad: Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, which are sparring over sharing of Krishna and Godavari river waters, are now gearing up for another standoff over fishing on Krishna and Tungabhadra rivers.These rivers run through the border of the two Telugu-speaking states and are conducive for fishing. Mostof the fishing activity takes place at Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir, Srisailam backwaters and Pulichintala project on the Krishna, and Somasila and Sunkesula projects on the Tungabhadra.Telangana fishermen are miffed that their counterparts from Andhra Pradesh enter into frequent brawls with them and ruin their business. A couple of weeks ago, around 15 Telangana fishermen were allegedly attacked by a few Andhra fishermen at Pulichintala project. This is among a series of attacks that have taken place since the bifurcation of the two states in 2014.Following the latest brawl, the Telangana government decided not to allow Andhra fishermen to enter into Telangana waters in the Krishna basin to catch fish.On Thursday, fishermen met Telangana animal husbandry minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav towork out a plan of action for stopping the attacks. Yadav assured that the K Chandrasekhar Rao government will keep a strict vigil on the entry of fishermen from the neighbouring state.A top official from the Telangana Fisheries Cooperative Society, on the condition of anonymity,said, “It has been decided that a strategy to avoid frequent brawls will be discussed by the government at all fishing hamlets and stern action will be taken. There is no clarity yet on what type of action would be taken up. Once we figure out the needs of the fishermen, we will submit a plan of action to the state government.”The Telangana government is also miffed that Andhra Pradesh does not release fishlings in its reservoirs.“Whatever fish is available is only because of the efforts made by the Telangana government. We have been releasing about 10 crore fishlings every year in July and September from 2015 unlike Andhra Pradesh, which does not do it. This has made fishermen from Andhra to fish in our territory,” said the fisheries society official.Another bone of contention of Telangana is the issue of licence to fishermen. The state says that it has given licences to 5,800 fishermen in the border districts of Gadwal, Wanaparthy, Nagarkurnool, Nalgonda and Suryapet. However, fishermen have complained that many who did not possess permit cards were also fishing and most of them hail from Andhra.Telangana officials say that if a decision is taken on joint fishing, then Andhra too should release fishlings. The fisheries department officials want Andhra Pradesh to spend money on fish production.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-andhra-now-at-odds-over-fishing-in-2-rivers-101629487987989.html
21-08-2021||India||K’taka govt to initiate programme to upgrade SC/ST schools: Bommai||Bengaluru Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Friday said that the state government will initiate a special programme to qualitatively upgrade Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and minority residential schools in the state. “It is the thinking of our government that in the days to come SC, ST, OBC and minority residential schools, we have invested a lot in their buildings and infrastructure and there is a need to qualitatively upgrade them,” Bommai said. The chief minister was speaking at the 106th birth anniversary of former Karnataka chief minister D Devaraj Urs, who was popular for his policies on backward classes and land reforms. Bommai said that there was a need to give “international standards of education” in these schools to make the children more competitive and create job opportunities. He said that such qualitative upgrades would help these children boost their confidence and get better prepared for competitive exams like NEET or CET. The statements come at a time when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Karnataka has been accused of neglecting interests of marginalised communities and continuing to prioritise the needs and demands of dominant castes like Lingayats, Vokkaligas and others who have a profound impact on the state’s politics and social life. The state government is also looking at increasing competitiveness of the state board schools to be on par with CBSE and other modes of teaching as Covid-19 exposed the faultlines in the archaic education system that prevails in the southern state. The education department is working to overhaul its system to make the state board children more competitive and have periodical reviews after the pandemic-induced lockdowns have led to the loss of almost two whole academic years. Bommai said that the government will start three new residential schools for children of nomadic tribes to safeguard their unique culture, with an outlay of ₹6 crore each . After taking over as chief minister on July 28, Bommai’s first decision was to approve the creation of a separate Scheduled Tribe secretariat and B Sriramulu was handed over this portfolio. Bommai said that the government would emphasise on the three “e” strategies of education, employment and empowerment. “Every year, we give away scholarships to students worth ₹625 crore....also residential schools for backward class students are also being run,” Bommai said on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-govt-to-initiate-programme-to-upgrade-sc-st-schools-bommai-101629487626107.html
21-08-2021||India||Siddaramaiah seeks caste census report||Bengaluru: Former Karnataka chief minister and Congress Leader of Opposition, Siddaramaiah, on Friday, lashed out at the Basavaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government for not releasing the findings of the 2015 caste census. He said the socio, economic and educational survey was not conducted “only for one caste”, claiming a hesitancy on the part of the new government to release the findings as they are likely to impact the existing caste equations in the state. “Former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy said that Siddaramaiah has got the report written. This is complete nonsense. The report is yet to reach the government. I had directed the then Backward classes department minister Puttaranga Shetty of the previous coalition government to approve the report. I was just (the) leader of (the) coordination committee. The then chief minister HD K opposed the approval. I agreed to avoid any further fight between both our parties,” Siddaramaiah said on Friday. The statements come at a time when several backward communities and the Opposition are piling pressure on the Bommai government to release the findings of the report to ensure justice to voiceless caste groups in Karnataka. The Siddaramaiah-led Congress government had commissioned the “Socio-Economic and Education Survey”, better known as caste-census, in 2015 at a cost of around ₹150 crore, employing 1.6 lakh people for 45 days to pose around 55 questions to 1.35 crore households across the state. Siddaramaiah has also been accused of holding back the findings of the report since his term in office ended in 2018, three years after the report was prepared, allegedly due to pressure from his own partymen belonging to dominant communities. The rise of reservation-related demands by dominant communities like the Panchamasali, one the largest sub-sects within the Lingayats, Vokkaligas, Valmiki and the Kuruba’s has added to the challenges of the Bommai government who has been trying to uphold the promises made by his predecessor, BS Yediyurappa. Several influential seers and pontiffs from caste-specific Mathas or monasteries have threatened to agitate if the Bommai government does not accede to their demands. Mathas have played an important role in shaping Karnataka’s caste-centric politics and are used as a bargaining chip to get better representation to the community. Most of the benefits even within these dominant communities are cornered by a few in power, leaving the remaining as vote banks or support systems with little or no benefits other than the name of the community itself. Requests of at least 36 such small communities remain pending before the Karnataka Backward Classes Commission, people aware of the developments said. “The report was prepared with the help of school teachers. The resources of our nation should be distributed equally and social justice should be achieved. Data is necessary to do this. Hence, we had ordered for the survey to be conducted,” Siddaramaiah said. Political analysts and observers believe that Siddaramaiah, from the Kuruba community, had commissioned the report to challenge Karnataka’s dominant-caste politics that has been controlled by Lingayats and Vokkaligas, believed to be the two biggest caste groups in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/siddaramaiah-seeks-caste-census-report-101629485526817.html
21-08-2021||India||Phone call from wife saved Dehradun man from Afghanistan crisis||Amid the efforts being put by the government to bring back over 300 of its residents from Afghanistan, 49-year-old Sanjay Gurung can’t thank God enough for “saving” him from going to the war-torn country.Gurung, an ex-serviceman from Dehradun, Uttarakhand, was all set to leave for Kabul on July 15 from Delhi when he got a phone call from his wife pleading not to go while he was in a taxi heading to the airport. Insisted by his mother too, he cancelled his plan midway while letting his three other friends go.“After what I am witnessing in Afghanistan at present, I just think it was God who saved me with that phone call from my wife at the last moment before entering the airport. I just can’t thank God enough,” said Gurung, who was going to join a private security agency in Kabul.Gurung said after retiring from the Army, he worked in a private security agency in Iraq in 2012 before going to Afghanistan for the same work.“The private security agencies in Afghanistan majorly recruit Gorkhas with an army background. I went there and worked for nine years before coming back in January this year as the agency reduced my salary. I then applied to another agency and got selected, for which I was supposed to leave on July 15.”He said fourteen others from Dehradun were also selected along with him in the same company.“Eleven of them got their visa first and left earlier. Four of us got it late and booked our tickets on Kam Air’s flight on July 15... my wife frantically called me pleading me to return citing the troublesome situation in Afghanistan. I was a little hesitant to stay back and tried to pacify her over a video call. Then, my mother also pleaded and I finally decided to return,” said Gurung.“I returned Dehradun on the same day and after a couple of weeks, the crisis triggered in Afghanistan with its ultimate fall in the hands of the Taliban. Then a few days ago, I received a video on WhatsApp in which a group of men like me from Dehradun could be seen appealing to the government to evacuate them. Among them, two of my three friends were also there. Though I feel fortunate, I am worried for their safety as well,” said Gurung, adding that while watching the news about Afghanistan, all the cities like Herat, Kandhar and Kabul where he worked, floated before his eyes. Gurung is now putting efforts to help the other men from Dehradun stranded in Afghanistan. “I am in touch with them while assuring them all possible help from my side for their evacuation. I am worried for their safety,” said Gurung. Meanwhile, four residents of Dehradun who were stranded in Afghanistan returned on Thursday in the evacuation flights which are being operated from the Kabul international airport. Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said that the “Government is putting all efforts to evacuate the Uttarakhand residents stranded in Afghanistan.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/phone-call-from-wife-saved-dehradun-man-from-afghanistan-crisis-101629485467029.html
21-08-2021||India||Organ donation picks up in Karnataka, 14 get new lease of life||Fourteen people got a new lease of life after the families of two patients, who were declared brain dead on Thursday, decided to donate their organs. 40-year-old Lawrence from Hunsur and 48-year-old Shobha from Kushalnagar were brought to Apollo BGS Hospitals in Mysuru from two different private hospitals in critical condition on Monday. Lawrence had met with an accident and was declared brain dead due to brain stem failure, while Shobha had suffered from a brain hemorrhage and was also declared brain dead on Thursday. According to the hospital authorities, the families came forward to offer their organs. This incident has brought relief to officials at the Jeevana Sarthakathe, who have been struggling to get organ donors during the pandemic. Jeevana Sarthakathe is the nodal agency for organ donations in the state. According to officials, the numbers of donations are showing signs of improvement. However, with more than 5,000 people on the waiting list, they believe more awareness is needed. The records of Jeevana Sarthakathe, the donations of organs had dropped drastically during the pandemic. While the state saw 105 donations in 2019, this number dropped to 35 in 2020. “With a big waiting list, getting people to donate has always a been a problem. The difficulties that came with the pandemic made it even worse,” said Lijamol Joseph, Chief Transplant Coordinator for the state. One of the biggest problems faced during the pandemic was the lack of medical facilities. A transplantation or organ donation requires Intensive Care Units and during the pandemic, they were short in supply. “We were taken by surprise by the pandemic. So, most of the hospitals dedicated the ICUs for Covid-19 cases. But now we have learned from it. This time around, there is better ICU management among hospitals,” she said. Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar on Thursday said that steps have been taken since Covid-19 has hampered blood and organ donation in the state. “Covid-19 has hampered blood and organ donation. We have taken few special measures to encourage organ donation in the state. We are planning to reorganize Jeevana Sarthakathe in the coming days,” said the health minister. To promote organ donations, on August 13, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai had registered himself as an organ donor. As of August, there are 5,056 patients listed for organs transplant. Out of this, 3,756 patients require kidneys, and this is followed by 1,084 patients who need liver transplantation. There is a requirement for 113 heart transplants, 48 lung transplants and there are 22 patients who require both heart and lungs. The increase in the number of donations in 2021 is however giving hope. Until August 2021, the number of donations has already gone past the numbers in 2020. Officials believe that if the number of donations could surpass the numbers in 2019. “There is a big change in attitude. Earlier, we had to sit with families and convince them, but now they are coming forward to offer organs once they realize the medical condition of the family members,” said Joseph. She added the family of actor Sanchari Vijay coming forward to donate his organs has had a big impact. 38-year-old Vijay was declared brain dead on June 15, after he met with a motorcycle accident. The decision of the actor’s family to come forward to offer his organs had made the headlines and this has helped spread the message among the rural areas, said Joseph. “The news (of actor’s organ donation) has traveled to the rural parts, and we see more people talking about it. This is a good sign. We are happy with how things are changing but as much awareness about organ donation is needed,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/organ-donation-picks-up-in-karnataka-14-get-new-lease-of-life-101629485405002.html
21-08-2021||India||Karnataka worst in distributing land deeds to forest dwellers: Data||Bengaluru Karnataka fares among the poorest in terms of distribution of land deeds to forest dwellers and tribals who have inhabited these lands for generations when compared to its counterparts in southern India, data shows, indicating how issues pertaining to non-dominant caste groups are rarely a priority for the state and its political dispensation. Out of the 275,446 applications received till end of 2020, only 14,667 titles have been distributed, according to the ministry of environment, forest and climate change in a response to the Lok Sabha. This amounts to 20,813.51 acres of forest land to dwellers who have been demanding proper titles for them to remain in their natural and traditional habitat without being under the sword of eviction. In comparison, Kerala has distributed 26,398 titles as against total requests of 43,331, data shows. Andhra Pradesh has distributed 96,675 titles, amounting to 239,554 acres out of the total 177,466 claims. Tamil Nadu has just 33,755 claims but has distributed 8,144 land titles, amounting to 9,626.44 acres. Telangana has processed and distributed 93,639 deeds, amounting to 300,284 acres as against 183,252 claims, data shows, indicating that Karnataka is lowest in distribution of land title deeds among the five large southern states. “There is a committee at taluk, gram and district level which decides these matters and the forest department is a part of it. If all criteria are met then the process moves forward,” said one senior government official from Karnataka, requesting not to be named. The official said that the social welfare department is the nodal office for such claims. However, the long delays in processing such claims and ensuring protection for vulnerable tribals forced the new government under chief minister Basvaraj Bommai to set up a separate portfolio of Scheduled Tribe (ST) welfare and B. Sriramulu has been made its first minister. But the political climate in the state, especially with ministers unhappy with their respective portfolios, including Sriramulu, the newly set up secretariat has barely taken off the ground, those aware of the developments said. At least five senior officials from Karnataka’s tribal welfare department could not be reached for comment including its minister, Sriramulu. Karnataka has a strong dominant caste-centric political reality with successive governments prioritising requests and demands from communities like Lingayats, Vokkaligas and Kurbas among others, leaving most of the other groups almost voiceless and without adequate representation or benefits. Sriramulu himself is from the dominant Valmiki community, classified as ST, who have been seeking better reservation opportunities. A total of 19,20,507 individual titles over an extent of 4,182,274 acres (1.69 million ha) of forest land in the country, including Maharashtra, have been distributed till December 31,2020 to the Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers. “The first thing we need to understand is that it’s not about giving land but about recognizing the fact that somebody was cultivating land before a certain date and that they were there for the right and not wrong reasons,” said Dr. Sharachchandra Lele, distinguished fellow in Environmental Policy & Governance at Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), a non-profit organisation. “It is about a recognition of a right they (tribals and forest dwellers) had,” he added. He said that there is no data on how many people are actually claimants of such lands as the number of applications does not provide the true picture. Hundreds and thousands of people are displaced from their homes due to development works and declaring of forests as national reserves which, he said, was earlier dealt with by giving monetary compensation but provided no hope for resettlement for those who have been moved out. A significant section of these communities is moved to the edges of forests where only a small section get homes but with no source of livelihoods. In the case of adivasis, experts said that governments (including the British before independence) recognized the dwellers’ right to land, water and worship but not the right to cultivate or hunt that rendered such people without a source of livelihood. Data shows that Karnataka has the third highest forest land under encroachment in the country. With more than 83,000 hectares under encroachment out of the total 1.33 million hectares in the country, Karnataka stands third nationally, data shows. Officials said that some of these encroachments include those by people occupying and living on forest land and rules prevent authorities from evicting those with less than three acres without proper rehabilitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-worst-in-distributing-land-deeds-to-forest-dwellers-data-101629485345537.html
21-08-2021||India||SC seeks Centre’s diplomacy to implement order against Kenyan national||New Delhi: The Supreme Court has sought the help of the Indian government for the implementation of its order before a Kenyan court in a child custody matter, after it was told that the High Court in the African country refused to recognise its order. The top court had granted permanent custody of an 11-year-old boy to his Indian-origin father Perry Kansagra, having a Kenyan passport, on October 28 last year. While doing so, the court required the father to obtain a “mirror order” from the Kenyan court reflecting the conditions and assurances arrived at between the parents – Perry and Smriti – before the Supreme Court. On Thursday, the court was informed that on May 21, the High Court of Kenya refused to recognise the order passed by the Supreme Court. The HC of Kenya situated at Nairobi said, “The Court makes a finding that the judgment from the Supreme Court of India, being from a superior court of a non-reciprocating country, and further being one in proceedings in connection with the custody or guardianship of a child, is not registrable in this Court.” Even the father, a permanent resident of Kenya, failed to appear during the proceedings, giving an impression to the court that they had been misled. In December last year, the Supreme Court was informed that on November 9, 2020, the Kenyan court had registered the judgment of the Supreme Court. With the child now outside Indian jurisdiction and the father in clear breach of the Supreme Court’s order, the bench of Justices UU Lalit and Ajay Rastogi requested Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to provide assistance in the case. The bench said, “The boy is a Kenyan citizen, but the child is a ward of this Court as we were exercising loco parentis (in place of parents) jurisdiction. For the first time we are being told that the Kenyan court has not recognised our order. Mirror orders are generally recognised by all countries. We were earlier told that it has been registered. With this new development, this man (the father) is in contempt of this court. We are requesting the Union of India if this matter could be diplomatically taken up with the other country. Or else, we will have to deal with it.” Solicitor General said, “At a personal level, I can ask the Indian Embassy officials at Kenya to call up the father and explain to him the situation and get him to follow the order. This matter can also be taken up diplomatically but only the Foreign Secretary will know what can be done.” The bench asked Mehta to adopt this course and inform the Court about any breakthrough by Tuesday. Senior advocate AS Chandhioke, appearing for the child’s mother, informed the court that the conduct of her husband was in breach of his undertaking given to this court on October 30. In December 2020, Smriti approached the court saying that a mere “registration of Supreme Court’s judgment” was not a guarantee for enforcement. She stated that Kenya has got a Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act to make provision for enforcement of judgments given in countries outside Kenya. But India and Kenya are not reciprocating countries and hence, provisions of this Act will not apply. Further, Section 3(3)(e) of this Act states that “nothing in this Act will apply to proceedings in connection with custody or guardianship of children.” But the top court dismissed this application and said, “Registration of judgment is sufficient compliance of the direction to obtain a mirror order issued from a competent court in Kenya.” The court realised there was no means now to get in touch with the father, who has not authorised his counsels to appear in the case anymore. The bench said, “This man has led us up the garden path and misled us. We will wait for the Solicitor General to have a word with the Embassy officials and Foreign Secretary to find a diplomatic solution. In case it does not happen, we will deal with it.” As a next step, the court had in mind to allow the mother to visit Nairobi. As part of its October 28 order, the father had already deposited a sum of ₹1 crore with the Supreme Court Registry as a guarantee to comply with the order. The bench said in such an eventuality, the Centre should extend all necessary help. Trans-national child custody battles involving Indian citizens have often ended up in contradictory orders being passed by courts in different countries. India is not a signatory to the Convention on Civil Aspects on International Child Abduction, 1980, and this is a chief reason why Indian courts find it difficult to enforce its orders on this aspect before foreign courts. Conscious of this gap in law, the Supreme Court in October 2020 directed a mirror order to be passed by the Kenyan court as Kenya too is not a signatory to the 1980 Convention. A mirror order is passed to ensure that the courts of the country where the child is being shifted are aware of the arrangements which were made in the country where he had ordinarily been residing. Such an order is meant to safeguard the interest of the parent who is losing custody, so that the rights of visitation and temporary custody are not impaired. The couple got married in 2007 and is living separately since April 2012. The child, who enjoys dual citizenship of Kenya and the United Kingdom, is an Overseas Citizen of India. The mother had initially filed a suit restraining her husband and his family from removing the child from her custody. In this suit the father was allowed visitation rights. Later, the boy’s father filed a Guardianship petition in a Delhi court that was allowed and later affirmed by the Delhi high court in February 2020. This order was set aside by the Supreme Court in its October 2020 judgment by a 2:1 majority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-centre-s-diplomacy-to-implement-order-against-kenyan-national-101629485165462.html
21-08-2021||India||Bihar recorded 251k excess deaths since Covid-19 pandemic: Data||There were at least 251,000 excess deaths registered under the Civil Registration System (CRS) in Bihar since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak (from March 2020 to May 2021), which is 48.6 times the official number of confirmed coronavirus deaths (5,163) in the state in the same time period, data accessed by HT shows.The figures from Bihar, based on deaths registered in the state’s Civil Registration System between January 2015 and May 2021, present one of the largest deviations in excess mortality seen in such calculations of any state in the country so far.“Excess death” or mortality is a generalised term that refers to the total number of deaths occurring due to all causes during a crisis that is above and beyond what would have been expected under regular conditions. To be sure, not all such excess deaths may be due to Covid-19, but during a pandemic such major deviations in fatalities is likely to be either directly or indirectly caused by the outbreak and the stress it had caused on a region’s healthcare system.For the analysis here, the CRS data from the pre-pandemic period (January 2015 to February 2020) has been averaged to establish an all-cause mortality baseline, which has then been compared to the deaths registered from March 2020 onwards, resulting in the number of “excess deaths”.Internationally and domestically, such data has provided vital information on the true toll of the pandemic on human life.For Bihar, data shows that there were 251,053 “excess deaths” since the start of the outbreak compared to the corresponding four-year period before the pandemic (2015-2019). The state’s official Covid-19 death toll till the end of May was 5,163. This means CRS data showed that the official Covid-19 death toll had an undercount factor of 48.6 times.Of these, over 126,000 such excess deaths were reported in the first five months of 2021 against 3,766 reported Covid-19 deaths in the same period – resulting in an undercount factor of 33.7 this year.During the Covid-19 outbreak, such data, calculated from CRS – a national system of recording all births and deaths, under the Office of the Registrar General of India and implemented on the ground by state governments – is being used to count the number of deaths that would not have occurred had the pandemic never happened.Similar analysis conducted by several news organisations such as The Hindu, Scroll, The News Minute, Article 14, among others, have estimated the undercount factor for different states, cities and districts in the country. Such estimates have been arrived at for Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, and have shown a wide range of undercount factors — as little as 0.42 times in Kerala to 43 times in UP (based on data from 24 of the state’s 75 districts).The findings from Bihar, however, appear to show the highest undercount factor in the country so far. This is not surprising as the state ranks the second lowest in the country (after UP) in Niti Aayog’s Health Index, 2020, and despite being home to 9% of the country’s population, has seen 9,649 confirmed deaths due to Covid, accounting for just 2.2% of the total 432,138 fatalities in the country till August 19, according to HT’s Covid dashboard.Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that Covid-19 deaths may be as much as two-three times the officially reported numbers.To be sure, as pointed out by Shamika Ravi in a July 14 article in HT, such an analysis suffers from certain shortcomings: historically, not all deaths in India are registered under CRS, which is why the Sample Registration System (SRS) – an annual survey conducted by the Office of the Registrar General in India – is considered the primary source of annual estimates of deaths. Furthermore, she writes that registered deaths are not necessarily domiciliary, while deaths, if registered at all, may not be reported promptly. She added that the level of registration from CRS to the estimated deaths from SRS is not uniform across the country and over time.Another factor in the increase in CRS numbers may be the improvement in registration of deaths in the country. According to the CRS’ 2019 annual report on “vital statistics”, while only 20.7% deaths in the country were medically certified, registration of deaths in India has improved to more than 90%.Thus, it is possible that the period since March 2020 has seen a sharp improvement in registration of deaths, resulting in the spike seen, with very little or none of the increase being on account of Covid-19.Indeed, despite the apparent improvement in registration of deaths, the CRS data from Bihar shows fluctuations – there were 204,093 registered deaths in 2015, but it dropped to 177,021 in 2016, then spiked to 261,425 in 2017, before dropping again in 2019 (213,989).Still, the magnitude of the difference since last March (a quarter of a million) is staggering.Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey said that he cannot comment on CRS data, but all the Covid-19 related deaths have been verified by district magistrates and civil surgeons.“That is why we were able to give a revised death figures in June. Yet we have from time-to-time requested to all if there has been death in their family where the cause in death certificate is mentioned as Covid 19, they can get their entry recorded and claim the compensation announced by the state government,” said the health minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-recorded-251k-excess-deaths-since-pandemic-data-101629484985619.html
21-08-2021||India||State’s bifurcation can’t take away quota benefits, says SC||The Supreme Court has held that bifurcation of states will not result in persons already employed under reserved categories to be dislodged of their benefits in the newly formed state.The top court was dealing with a petition by a man who was appointed as an assistant teacher in December 1999 at Ranchi as a scheduled caste (SC) candidate. Pankaj Kumar also opted to serve in Jharkhand after the new state was carved out of Bihar in 2000.But when Pankaj Kumar applied as an SC candidate for the state’s combined civil services examination in 2008, he was not appointed despite his selection on the grounds that he was a migrant in Jharkhand and not entitled to reservation benefits since his service book showed him to be a permanent resident of Patna.“It will be highly unfair and pernicious if the benefits of reservation with privileges and benefits flowing thereof are not being protected in the State of Jharkhand after he is absorbed by virtue to Section 73 of the 2000 Act that clearly postulates not only to protect the existing service conditions but the benefit of reservation and privileges which he was enjoying on or before the appointed day, i.e. 15 November 2000 in the State of Bihar not to be varied to his disadvantage after he became a member of service in the State of Jharkhand,” a bench of justices UU Lalit and Ajay Rastogi ruled.The court directed the Jharkhand government to appoint Kumar on the post that he was selected for in 2008 and give him the seniority as per his placement in the order of merit with notional pay and allowances but not back wages.The bench noted that the petitioner was born in Hazaribagh in 1974 which came under Jharkhand after the enactment of the Bihar Reorganization Act 2000 and belonged to caste recognized as a scheduled caste in both Bihar and Jharkhand.The court noted that Sections 73 and 74 of the 2000 Act protected the employment of only those reserved candidates from undivided Bihar who opted to remain in the employment of Bihar government while employees of undivided Bihar who opted for service in Jharkhand government were denied recognition by Jharkhand terming them as migrants. At the same time, Bihar introduced a new rule in 2003 under the Bihar Reservation of Vacancies in Posts and Services(for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes) Act, 1991, limiting reservation benefits to only those who are residing in Bihar.The apex court noted that such a matter involving reservation benefits being denied as a result of bifurcation was arising for the first time.“In our considered view, such of the employees who are members of the SC/ST/OBC whose caste/tribe has been notified by an amendment to the Constitution(Scheduled Castes)/(Scheduled Tribes) Order 1950 under Vth and VIth Schedule to Sections 23 and 24 of the Act of 2000 or by the separate notification for members of other backward class (OBC) category, the benefit of reservations including privileges and benefits flowing thereof, shall remain protected by virtue of Section 73 of the Act 2000 for all practical purposes which can be claimed (including by their wards) for participation in public employment.”The court was assisted by Attorney General KK Venugopal who said that a February 1985 government order does specify that reserved category candidates will be entitled to claim benefits within their home state and not in the state to which they have migrated.But here it was not a case of voluntary or involuntary migration but bifurcation, he said.Venugopal said by virtue of Section 73 and 74 of the Bihar Reorganisation Act, the reservation rights of residents of the 18 districts included in Jharkhand would stand protected for all practical purposes and such class of persons (as the petitioner) would not be considered as migrants to Jharkhand. He clarified that reservation benefits could be claimed only in one state and not both states, a point that was reiterated by the court as well.The court noted that the inclusion of the caste/tribe under the Presidential Order 1950 identified them because of the “disadvantages and social hardships” being faced by the members concerned in the integrated state of Bihar and by this yardstick, they will remain entitled to seek the benefit of reservation throughout the state of Jharkhand for public employment.The court also ruled on a batch of appeals filed by six candidates of SC/ST/OBC categories who were appointed as constables in Jharkhand but were removed from service in June 2008 on the ground that they were migrants in the successor state. On merits, the apex court found that they were indeed migrants as they had no proof of how long they were staying in Jharkhand and failed to produce their caste certificate at the time of appointment.But the court invoked its extraordinary powers and directed their reinstatement as undeniably, they belonged to the SC/ST/OBC category in the undivided Bihar and had already served for a period of three to four years as constables with Jharkhand police. Having lost 13 years in litigation, it would be hard for them to secure employment at this later stage, the bench observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-bifurcation-can-t-take-away-quota-benefits-says-sc-101629484746757.html
21-08-2021||India||Have been made a scapegoat: IPS officer Rashmi Shukla to Bombay HC||Senior IPS officer Rashmi Shukla on Friday told the Bombay high court that she has been made a scapegoat for submitting a report on alleged corruption in police transfers and postings.The bench of Justices SS Shinde and NJ Jamadar was hearing her petition for quashing of the FIR registered by the cyber cell for alleged illegal phone tapping and leaking of her report regarding corruption in police transfers and postings.Shukla, the then head of the State Intelligence Department (SID), told the bench through her counsel, senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani: “I am an upright officer. I was shunted out in an illegal manner from the post of State Intelligence Department, Commissioner, without following any proper procedure as I had made the report.”“I had got sanctions from time to time from Additional Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte from July 17, 2020 to July 29, 2020 to carry out the phone tappings. I had managed to bring to light the nexus between brokers and others assigning in postings to police officers and nine of them had actually got the postings,” Jethmalani told the bench.“I was abruptly transferred on 2nd September without following due procedure as DGP Civil Defence. There was no office neither any staff allotted to the office. The State has made nine posts of DGP without permission from Home Affairs or any approval from the State Cabinet.”Shukla’s counsel further told the court: “Despite having all the permission to carrying out the tappings, I am now been made a scapegoat. Kunte is trying to exonerate himself. A report by Kunte already blames me and further says that I accepted my mistake before him and told him that my husband had died due to cancer and my children were still studying. This is a lie. I had only told him if there was a problem, I was ready to withdraw my report. My husband died in 2018. I am even ready to undergo a lie detector test provided others are also willing to take it to bring out the truth.”“I have done nothing wrong in my job as SID Commissioner and duly followed my duty and if the state thought there was nothing in my report why was it reluctant to share it with the CBI that is demanding it,” Jethmalani argued.The FIR was a trigger after senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and opposition leader in the assembly, Devendra Fadnavis, gave an interview to a television channel on March 23 citing the report and corruption in transfers. A case was registered on March 26 in the matter, Jethmalani told the bench.The bench while continuing the protection granted to Shukla, posted the matter for Saturday when the Maharashtra government is likely to argue on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/have-been-made-a-scapegoat-ips-officer-rashmi-shukla-to-bombay-hc-101629484625766.html
21-08-2021||India||MP bank siphoned off more than ₹200 cr to fake accounts: Officials||More than ₹200 crore was siphoned off from a cooperative bank in Madhya Pradesh to various account holders using fake accounts in 2015, people familiar with the developments said. While manager of Dabhora cooperative bank, Ramkrishna Mishra, was arrested in 2015, the Economic Offences Wing will soon begin a probe into the role of other employees, they added. According to officials in the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), more than ₹200 crores was transferred from the bank to at least 11 accounts in various private banks. These 11 accounts, according to the officials, were opened using forged documents, and photographs and addresses belonging to various people. The photograph of a daily wage labourer, Pramod Shukla, was used to open one such fake account. Shukla, who earns ₹8,000 per month, was unaware about transactions worth ₹40 lakh made via the account till he got a call from the police a few days ago as part of the probe into the case.“I am a daily wager and don’t have an account in any bank. Some police officers told me that some fraudster used my picture and name for opening an account. Now, they have launched an investigation to find out who did it and how,” Shukla said. Mishra has been accused of using the fake accounts to transfer the money to his relatives.“We found that the accounts were opened using fake identity cards. The account holders turned out to be daily wagers and farmers. The accused used the picture of one person and the address of some other person. Similarly, they opened a company account by using the address and picture of a farmer, Shyam Kumar,” an investigating officer said on condition of anonymity. “The accused used these fake accounts more than a thousand times to transfer around ₹200 crore from the bank to various accounts,” he added. Using the siphoned off money, real estate was purchased by the accused in metropolitan cities like Delhi and Mumbai, the investigating agency said, adding that a probe into the properties is underway. “The role of bank officials of the other private banks is also under scanner as they opened these accounts without physical verification. We will interrogate them too,” Virendra Jain, SP, EOW, Rewa, said.The bank has closed accounts of beneficiaries who deposited their savings into the bank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-bank-siphoned-off-more-than-200-cr-to-fake-accounts-officials-101629484384900.html
21-08-2021||India||Projects in protected zones to draw 2% surcharge as mitigation measure||The National Board for Wildlife has decided to impose a cost of 2% of the proportionate value of any development or infrastructure project in a protected zone such as a national park or a wildlife sanctuary. The levy of 2% will not be on the entire value of the project but of that part of the project a falling within the said zone, according to the minutes of a key board meeting published on Thursday.The amount raised will be utilised to mitigate the impact of such projects on ecology and wildlife. The standing committee of the board, chaired by Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav, took up the issue in its 64th meeting held on August 7. The minutes, published on Thursday said that states have been imposing a certain percentage of the project cost for mitigation of the environmental impact. The states/UTs impose costs at different rates.“The ministry has received requests that the cost imposed should be based on the proportion of the project lying within the protected area or the eco-sensitive zone rather than the total cost of the project. The ministry has also received requests that instead of imposing costs on project proponents, they may be asked to implement mitigation measures,” the minutes said.R Sukumar, board member and an ecologist specialising in elephants, said during the meeting that the cost for mitigation measures should be 2% of the proportionate cost of projects falling within the protected area. He also suggested that there should be an analysis of the cost imposed and mitigation measures taken in various states.HS Singh, former principal chief conservator of forests and a member of the board, said if the project proponents are allowed to carry out mitigation measures inside protected areas, it will cause interference in the management of forests. The board finally decided that 2% of the proportionate cost of projects falling inside protected areas and eco-sensitive zones may be imposed in future. This amount is to be spent on mitigation measures within the same protected area.UD Singh, another board member, said guidelines should be framed for fixing the impact cost of these projects.”The states were already imposing this cost at different rates. It was arbitrary, so now it has been clarified that 2% will be charged. Also, it means that 2% of the project cost that is falling within the protected area and not 2% of the entire project cost. For example, a pipeline or a road can cover several kilometers, so the cost cannot be imposed on the entire project value. Many states were charging more than 2% of the proportionate project cost,” said a board member who did not wish to be named.The environment ministry in a letter to all states and UTs on October 28, 2015 advised that 2% of the proportionate project cost falling in protected areas should be imposed by states. This has been referred to in various board meeting minutes but the letter itself is not on the ministry website.Environmental and legal experts said instead of imposing an arbitrary cost, projects in protected areas should be discouraged as much as possible. The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 states that no person shall “destroy, exploit or remove any wildlife including forest produce from a national park or destroy or damage or divert the habitat of any wild animal by any act whatsoever … except under and in accordance with a permit granted by the Chief WildLife Warden, and no such permit shall be granted unless the State Government is satisfied in consultation with the National Board for Wildlife that such removal of wildlife is necessary for the improvement and better management of wildlife therein”.Between 2015-16 and 2019-20, 680 projects in protected areas were granted wildlife clearance, the environment ministry informed the Rajya Sabha on September 14 last year.“The decision to impose a levy of 2% of the project cost for mitigation measures and that too within the same protected area is ecologically and legally flawed. The most basic scientific tenet of ecology is to prevent habitat fragmentation by inclusion of at least 10 times the area sought for diversion. Instead of explaining this to the new minister, the ecologist on the committee has shockingly proposed a 2% levy, while senior forest officers have failed to intervene and highlight the risks involved,” said Praveen Bhargav of the Bengaluru-based Wildlife First, a conservation advocacy group.“The law mandates that there can be no destruction (by projects) unless it is for the improvement and better management of wildlife. The destruction caused due to habitat fragmentation by a project obviously cannot be mitigated by imposing a 2% levy.”Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research, said: “This may or may not have been a practice carried out by different states or the Centre, which has now been rationalised. There are two larger issues to consider. First, this is yet another signal that all land, irrespective of the degree of legal protection, needs to make way for industrial and infrastructure expansion. Second, the financial offsets of such land use change continue to be designed through the sensibility of a few ‘experts’ and without any disclosure of how the calculations were arrived at.”The standing committee also decided that their meetings would be held once in a month instead of once in three months to minimise delays in assessing projects seeking wildlife clearance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/projects-in-protected-zones-to-draw-2-surcharge-as-mitigation-measure-101629483846014.html
21-08-2021||India||Opposition meet focuses on strategy for 2024||Congress president Sonia Gandhi asked India’s top Opposition leaders to rise above individual compulsions “in the interest of the nation” and start planning “systematically” as the “ultimate goal is the 2024 Lok Sabha elections”, in her first formulation for the next national elections, according to her party.The parties are likely to form a core committee, meet at regular intervals and might even expand this grouping to woo other non-NDA outfits—indicating their intent to start preparing even as the Lok Sabha elections are three years later. Traditionally, Opposition parties have never joined hands or started poll preparations so much in advance.Addressing virtually a meeting of 19 parties here on Friday, Sonia, who had a pivotal role in forming the UPA in 2004, told the Opposition that the “single-minded objective” should be to give India a government that “believes in the values of the Freedom Movement and in the principles and provisions of our Constitution”. She also expressed confidence that the new-found unity of Opposition in Parliament “will be sustained in future sessions” but reminded that “the larger political battle has to be fought outside it”.The first meeting, however, also saw some political jockeying. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, trying to build a wider Opposition front, strongly pitched for inclusion of other non-NDA parties. “Dipankar Bhattacharya of CPI(ML) should be invited. Our fight is against the BJP. For these meetings, even those not allied with Congress must be invited,” she is said to have told those present. CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury argued that only parties present in Parliament have been invited.Sonia acknowledged that it would be a “challenge” to keep the group together. “Together we can and must rise to it because there is simply no alternative to working cohesively. We all have our compulsions, but clearly, time has come when the interests of our nation demand that we rise above them,” she said, ahead of a daunting task of bringing various regional outfits with conflicting interests to form a grand coalition to take on a formidable Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP in the next elections.“The 75th anniversary of India’s Independence is indeed the most appropriate occasion for us to reaffirm our individual and collective resolve. Let me say for its part, the Indian National Congress will not be found wanting,” she said.Rahul Gandhi, who spoke at the fag end of the meeting, described the BJP’s vision and said the Opposition needs to offer an alternative vision to the people.In the meeting that lasted two and a half hours, Yechury accused the Modi government of destroying constitutional values and replacing them with RSS doctrines. “We have to firmly decide to save India today. All constitutional bodies, election commission, Parliament, CBI, ED are being undermined by this government.”While all leaders spoke about Pegasus, Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren tried to say that farm laws and price rise are more important issues than Pegasus. Some Opposition leaders quickly tried to describe how Pegasus can infiltrate the personal space of a person. RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav suggested that the caste census should be part of the joint statement even as Banerjee suggested that a joint statement (prepared by Yechury) should not be drafted in advance. She also suggested to pick just 5-6 issues and reiterated that the leadership would not be an issue as “people of India would lead” them.“Of course, the ultimate goal is the 2024 Lok Sabha elections for which we have to begin to plan systematically with the single-minded objective of giving to our country a government that believes in the values of the Freedom Movement and in the principles and provisions of our Constitution,” Sonia said.The core committee, an idea tossed by Banerjee and Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray, is likely to be formed and meet once a month to take stock of the political situation.In the joint statement, the Opposition parties demanded augmenting “all vaccine production capabilities in India, procure vaccines globally and speed up the free universal mass vaccination drive immediately”, free cash transfers of ₹7,500 per month to “all families outside the income tax bracket” and “free food kits containing all essential commodities of daily consumption to all the needy”.The parties also demanded that the government “withdraw unprecedented hikes in central excise duties on petrol & diesel, reduce prices of cooking gas and essential commodities, particularly cooking oil, and control galloping inflation” and “repeal the three anti-agriculture laws and compulsorily guarantee MSP to farmers”.In a statement issued in the evening, the TMC said that Mamata Banerjee proposed the “constitution of a core committee to rightfully address the issues that the people of India are facing”.Thackeray spoke of fighting together against the ruling party to save democracy in the country, senior Sena leader Sanjay Raut said.Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, who was also in the virtual meeting, called for time-bound collective efforts by Opposition parties to deal with the issues the country is facing.Raut, who was also part of the meeting, said, “Uddhav ji said that the unity among the Opposition parties must remain intact. Besides that, he said that we have to give people the confidence that the political parties that have come together will remain united. Uddhav ji spoke about fighting together and saving democracy.”Pawar, meanwhile, said that the current scenario in India appears very gloomy. Farmers have been protesting for many months and it is an anguishing picture for a democratic country.Samajwadi Party (SP), one of the parties invited, did not join the meeting. “Our national president Akhilesh Yadav ji already had meetings and events scheduled for the day at the party office in Lucknow. SP didn’t join the (Sonia Gandhi’s) meeting,” said party spokesperson and former UP minister Rajendra Chaudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-meet-focuses-on-strategy-for-2024-101629483725358.html
21-08-2021||India||Fault lines emerging between partners BJP and JD(U) in Bihar||Signs of unease between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Janata Dal (United) over issues including caste-based enumeration and the Pegasus snooping row have begun surfacing, nearly nine months after the parties formed a coalition government in Bihar.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, along with a delegation of opposition leaders in the state, will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 23, to push for a caste-based census, a long-standing demand of many parties that believe the reservation system is no longer representative of the demographic split of the population across castes.The BJP has been reluctant to touch the sensitive issue (as, indeed, any party in power in the Centre has been) for fear of a political backlash. A caste census was conducted in 2011 but its results were not released.“Status quo-ist forces and those who are anti-change are against the decision to have a caste-based enumeration,” JD(U) general secretary KC Tyagi said, referring to the BJP’s reluctance to conduct a caste-based census. “These forces fear that if the percentage of OBCs is higher than the 52% recorded by the Mandal Commission, there might be a demand for more quota.”He said that the JD(U) is also in favour of doing away with the present cap of 50% on all quotas.The current reservation regime in India is based on the recommendations of the Mandal Commission dating back to the 1980s and a Supreme Court ruling capping reservations at 50%.The Bihar assembly, in 2019 and 2020, passed a resolution seeking a caste-based census. Interestingly, the resolutions were supported by the BJP. A socio-economic and caste census was conducted by the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance in 2011. The caste data, however, was not released. India’s last caste census was conducted in 1931.The demands for the caste-based enumeration come soon after the Bihar CM also called for a probe into the Pegasus snooping issue. “Phone tapping has been discussed for a long time. One never knows how one’s phone can be tapped these days. So, there must be a probe,” the chief minister said on August 2.The BJP-led central government on Monday refrained from confirming or denying in the Supreme Court its use of the spyware for alleged surveillance.The Pegasus row erupted on July 18 after an international investigative consortium reported that the phones of Indian ministers, politicians, activists, businessmen and journalists were among the 50,000 that were potentially targeted by Pegasus, Israeli company NSO Group’s phone hacking software.Another instance of fissures between the alliance partners emerged on Wednesday when Bihar water resources minister Sanjay Jha countered the Union government’s claim that 14.6 million water connections were provided in the state under the Centre’s Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) for rural households.Jha said that 87% of rural households in the state have access to clean tap water and credited the state government for the achievement. “Thanks to vision of Hon CM Shri @NitishKumar, 87% of Bihar rural households have access to clean tap water,” he said in a tweet on Wednesday.Asked if a difference of opinion on key issues would hurt the alliance, a JD(U) leader speaking on condition of anonymity said that both the parties were working to fulfil their individual commitments.“The BJP has been working to fulfil its ideological concerns, whether it is the construction of the Ram Temple or abrogation of Article 370 to nurse its constituency. We are not a frontal organisation (of the BJP), we are a separate party that has the right to nurse our constituency without confrontation,” the leader said.Meanwhile, there are speculations in the state that the JD(U) cadre wants the party to contest the Manipur and Uttar Pradesh assembly elections next year on its own. “There is a sense among party workers that to retain its position as a bigger partner in Bihar and to increase its presence across the country, the JD(U) should contest elections on its own and not rely on allies,” the second JD(U) leader cited above said.To be sure, the BJP actually won more seats than the JD(U) in the 2020 assembly elections -- 74 to 43 in the 243-member assembly.Tyagi said that the party’s priority is to continue its alliance with the BJP, even as he said that the JD(U) can contest independently in the two states in case no agreement can be reached with the BJP. “We have conveyed to the Prime Minister and the party leadership that we are keen to contest as allies and we are hopeful of a positive response. But if that does not happen, we will contest alone,” he said.BJP’s Bihar MLC Sanjay Mayukh, however, downplayed the divergence. “Sometimes, parties that are members of the NDA contest elections independently. But as far as the NDA alliance in Bihar and at the Centre is concerned, it is unified for the development of the people,” he said.In July, JD(U) leader RCP Singh was inducted into the Union cabinet as minister for steel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fault-lines-emerging-between-partners-bjp-and-jd-u-in-bihar-101629483606174.html
21-08-2021||India||Hasty passage of bills not unique to NDA govt||6, 6, 8, 5, 5, 9, 5, 5, 9, 7—these are not digits of a cellphone number but minutes are taken to pass proposed laws in the Lok Sabha during the monsoon session of Parliament. The laws passed amidst the din and without debate, triggered controversy as the Opposition alleged the government avoided parliamentary scrutiny and debate.But data available with PRS Legislative Research shows that during the UPA1 and UPA2 governments too, a large number of bills were passed with little debate in the Lok Sabha.In the 14th Lok Sabha, the UPA’s first term between 2004 and 2009, 33 bills were approved with each one taking less than 5 minutes. This amounts to 18% of 182 bills approved in the Lok Sabha during the entire five-year term.Of these 33 bills, eight were passed on December 24, 2008, in 17 minutes, setting a record for hasty passage of bills as the BJP, then in the Opposition, disrupted the House over then minority affairs minister AR Antuley’s remarks that ATS chief Hemant Karkare’s death during the terror attack in Mumbai should be probed.The 15th Lok Sabha—the second term of the Manmohan Singh government—saw 20 bills or 17% of the total laws passed during the five-year term approved in five minutes or less. And 11 other bills were cleared swiftly with each one taking less than 30 minutes, according to PRS data.A bill, after introduction, is usually referred to a standing committee for review. Once the House panel submits its report, the bill is scheduled for “consideration and passing”. The Business Advisory Committee of each House—a multi-party panel headed by the Chair—allows time for its discussion. Normally, one to three hours are allotted for discussion for a bill.Congress leaders, however, pointed out that during the Modi regime, very few bills have been sent to House panels for review. In an interview with HT, the Congress’s Rajya Sabha chief whip Jairam Ramesh said, “The Opposition’s agitation is justified. Just 12% of the bills in the second term of the Modi government (were sent to the panels). It was 27% in the first term of Modi and in the UPA 1 and 2, 71% and 60% bills were referred to panels for review.”The monsoon session of Parliament witnessed as many as 19 bills passed without any debate as the government decided to push important bills amid the Opposition-led deadlock over the Pegasus spyware issue and the farm laws. The only bill to go through a proper debate was the 127th Constitution Amendment bill. Lawmakers spoke on the bill for 7.54 hours in the Lok Sabha—the longest debate on any bill during the Narendra Modi government.To be sure, laws were cleared after extensive debates in the first term of the Modi government (2014-19), and just one bill was passed in less than 5 minutes. Another eight took half an hour each to be decided in the Lok Sabha. But other laws saw extensive discussion lasting from an hour to a marathon of 7.28 hours. The last was a discussion of the bills on the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into Union territories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hasty-passage-of-bills-not-unique-to-nda-govt-101629483127871.html
21-08-2021||India||Upgraded Vande Bharat rakes likely to be ready by June 2022||The next lot of Vande Bharat rakes with upgraded amenities as well as better seating, security, and surveillance systems along with features designed for emergencies is expected to be commercially available from June 2022 onwards, according to officials aware of the development.“The first prototype rake is tentatively planned to be dispatched in March 2022, which will be put to commercial service tentatively by June 2022,” a senior official said.Some of the new amenities/safety features planned to be added include Four emergency windows for easy evacuation of passengers in case of an emergency; disaster lights in all coaches, to be used in the event of failure of all other lights in a disaster situation; more emergency push buttons (four per coach).The coaches will also have a centralized coach monitoring system for all electrical, climate control, and other vital functions of the train set. An important upgrade in the new coaches will be a “pushback arrangement” for better reclining of seats. In the first two rakes of the Vande Bharat trains, issues regarding the seating comfort level were raised.The new trains will also have fire survival cables indoor circuits. The coaches will have the availability of ventilation for three hours in case of failure of power supply to the roof-mounted AC package unit.“It will also have better availability, a more reliable and bacteria-free air conditioning system, and a higher flood protection underframe equipment to ensure reliability during the monsoon,” the official cited above said.The development comes following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence Day announcement on rolling out 75 new Vande Bharat Express trains that will be launched to connect different parts of the country in 75 weeks to mark the ongoing “Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav”.The Indian Railways in September last year floated a revised tender for procuring 44 semi-high speed 44 Vande Bharat trains mandating 75% domestic components, making it a domestic tender. The government had earlier scrapped three global tenders for the ambitious project. Hyderabad-based engineering firm Medha, which in February secured the contract to supply the electrical systems for 44 Vande Bharat trains, has now been told to advance its production plan so that at least two prototypes can be rolled out by next March following all trials.Modi flagged off the maiden run of a Vande Bharat train on the New Delhi-Varanasi route on February 15, 2019. The second such train service between New Delhi and Shri Mata Vaishnodevi Katra was flagged off by home minister Amit Shah on October 3 that year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/upgraded-vande-bharat-rakes-likely-to-be-ready-by-june-2022-101629483008605.html
21-08-2021||India||Terror forces’ presence never permanent: PM Modi||Destructive and terror forces may be dominant for some time, but their existence is never permanent, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday, against the backdrop of the Taliban seizing control of Afghanistan, prompting thousands of citizens to flee the country.During a virtual address, Modi cited the example of the historic Somnath temple, which despite being torn down several times over centuries, has managed to stand the test of time. “Somnath temple is a symbol of trust and assurance for the entire world. Forces of destruction who follow the ideology of creating empires out of terror can dominate for some time, but their existence is never permanent,” he said. The Prime Minister, who is also the chairman of the Shree Somnath Trust, made the remarks while laying the foundation stone for four projects, worth ₹83 crore, in Somnath, including — Somnath Promenade, Somnath Exhibition Centre, Parvati Temple and reconstructed temple precinct of Old (Juna) Somnath.“This temple was demolished numerous times over several centuries in the past. Idols of deities were also desecrated. Attempts were made to erase its existence. But it came up again in its full glory every time it was demolished,” he added.During the address, Modi highlighted his government’s focus on tourism and pointed to the jump in India’s rank in the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index -- from 65th in 2013 to 34th in 2019.The PM also stressed the importance of religious tourism in the country, saying that out of the total 40 pilgrimage places covered under the Centre’s PRASAD (Pilgrimage Rejuvenation And Spiritual Augmentation Drive) scheme, the work on 15 projects was already over.“We are now planning to connect Somnath with other tourist spots and cities of the state so that people who visit one place are encouraged to visit other places too,” he said, adding that the Centre has identified 19 iconic tourist destinations across the country for further development. Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and other dignitaries attended the programme at a temple auditorium, while While Union home minister Amit Shah participated virtually.Reacting to the PM’s speech, former Gujarat Congress president Arjun Modhwadia said, “Modi always tries to create a scare among the people in the name of terrorism, but he goes silent when it comes to action.” “Why is he not spelling out his position on the situation in Afghanistan? Whatever happened to his foreign policy, which has failed there (in Afghanistan) as also in China,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terror-forces-presence-never-permanent-pm-101629482946945.html
21-08-2021||India||Johnson & Johnson applies for Covid-19 vaccine study in Indian adolescents||American pharma giant Johnson & Johnson (J&J) has sought approval from India’s drugs regulator to conduct clinical trials of its Covid-19 vaccine for the people in the 12-17 age group in the country.The company submitted an application to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) on Tuesday, August 17, to conduct the trials of J&J’s single-dose Covid-19 vaccine.J&J has confirmed the development. “Johnson & Johnson is committed to facilitating global equitable access to its Covid-19 vaccine and recognises the unmet needs of children. On 17 August 2021, we submitted an application to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) to conduct a study of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine in India in adolescents aged 12-17 years,” said J&J India spokesperson in a statement.“To ultimately achieve herd immunity, it is imperative that Covid-19 vaccine clinical trials continue to move forward in this population, and we remain deeply committed to the critical work needed to make our Covid-19 vaccine equitably accessible for all age groups.”On August 7, the Drugs Controller General of India granted J&J’s Covid vaccine emergency use authorisation for adults. It is the fifth vaccine and the second foreign-made after Moderna’s to receive such authorisation.If permitted, J&J’s would be the third Covid-19 vaccine to be tested for use in children in India. There are two vaccine candidates that have been tested among children in India: Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Zydus Cadila’s ZyCov-D. The Covaxin trial includes 525 volunteers while ZyCov-D’s trials – as part of phase II/III clinical studies – include 1,000 volunteers in the 12-18 age group. There are 145.4 million people in India between the ages of 12 and 18 (excluding 18).J&J entered a partnership with India’s Hyderabad-based Biological E earlier this year to conduct a clinical trial and produce its Covid-19 vaccine in India. The vaccine is developed by the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of J&J.Through Biological E, the American company in May applied for permission from the national drugs controller to conduct bridging clinical trials locally in India for its Covid-19 vaccine.Since the government later modified its regulatory provisions for grant of emergency use authorisation to foreign-made Covid-19 vaccines, J&J put forth a fresh application for grant of emergency use authorisation on August 5. J&J withdrew its earlier application to conduct the bridging studies.Apart from the J&J and Moderna vaccines, the other three Covid-19 vaccines approved for emergency use in India are Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, and the Russian-made Sputnik V.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/johnson-johnson-applies-for-covid-19-vaccine-study-in-indian-adolescents-101629442683103.html
21-08-2021||India||Taliban wanted India to retain its diplomatic presence in Afghanistan||As it became apparent earlier this week that New Delhi planned to bring back its officials from Kabul, senior Taliban leader Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanekzai reached out to the Indian side with a surprise request: Would India retain its diplomatic presence in Afghanistan?The request was conveyed informally and indirectly by the Taliban leader, who is part of the leadership of the group’s political office at Doha in Qatar, shortly before India evacuated some 200 people – including its envoy, diplomats, security personnel, and citizens–in two military flights on Monday and Tuesday.Stanekzai, who is seen as the number two in the Taliban’s negotiating team and third overall among leaders based in Qatar, has been critical of India’s role in Afghanistan in the past, and the message took Indian officials in New Delhi and Kabul by surprise, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.He conveyed to the Indian side in his informal message that the group was aware of Indian concerns regarding the security situation in Kabul following the Taliban takeover on Sunday, but that it should not worry about the safety of its mission and diplomats in the Afghan capital, the people said.Also Read | Taliban ask Afghan imams to urge people not to try to flee at Friday prayersMore specifically, Stanekzai referred to reports that fighters from the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ) were in Kabul and deployed at check posts set up by the Taliban on the route to the airport, and contended that all check posts, including those at the airport, were firmly in the hands of the Taliban, the people added.A quick assessment done by the Indian side and its Afghan counterparts came to the conclusion that the request from the Taliban side could not be taken at face value and that the evacuation of the Indian diplomats and others should go ahead as planned, people said.As reported by Hindustan Times on Tuesday, the evacuation was done after the Indian side received intelligence reports that certain “rogue elements” and members of LeT and Haqqani Network, both Pakistan-based terror groups, had entered Kabul with Taliban fighters who took over the capital following the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government.People familiar with developments said once these reports were received, no chances could be taken with the safety of diplomats and other officials in Kabul as Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given instructions that the security and return of the Indians were of paramount importance.The development also reflects the Taliban’s apparent efforts to reach out to the international community amid growing concerns about the group’s actions affecting security and human rights in Afghanistan, and the Indian side’s misgivings about the Taliban despite opening channels of communication with the group in recent months.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to the development.Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen has said on Twitter that the group would not create a hindrance in the functioning of embassies and consulates. “We assure all diplomats, embassies, consulates, and charitable workers, whether they are international or national that not only no problem will be created for them on the part of IEA but a secure environment will be provided to them, Inshallah,” he tweeted on August 16.Hindustan Times was the first to report on June 8 about India opening channels of communication with Taliban factions and leaders, including Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, against the backdrop of the drawdown of US forces in Afghanistan.Besides exchanging messages with Baradar, the Indian side has also been in touch with Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa and Mullah Mohammed Fazil, the people said. Both Khairkhwa and Fazil were held at the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba after their capture following the collapse of the previous Taliban regime in 2001.Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, who served as the Taliban’s ambassador in Pakistan, had also informally advised the Indian side in Kabul regarding contacts with the Taliban, the people added.Stanekzai, who trained for about 18 months at the Indian Military Academy (IMA) in Dehradun during 1982-83, when he was an officer in the Afghan Army, has emerged as a top Taliban negotiator in recent years. He subsequently left the army to join Pakistan-based mujahideen who opposed the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.He created a flutter last year by accusing India of playing a “negative role” in Afghanistan for the past 40 years. If the Indian government reconsiders its policy and wants an active role in peace, reconciliation and reconstruction, the Taliban would welcome it and look at it positively, he had said.At the time, the Afghan foreign ministry had rejected Stanekzai’s remarks and said India had been cooperating in development and was expected to contribute to the Afghan peace process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taliban-wanted-india-to-retain-its-diplomatic-presence-in-afghanistan-101629430323448.html
21-08-2021||Today's||Restoring the integrity of the Indian Parliament||On India’s 75th Independence day, the Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana expressed his anguish about the manner in which laws were being legislated in Parliament.He stated, “Now, it is a sorry state of affairs. There are a lot of gaps and a lot of ambiguity in the law-making process due to [the] lack of debates. We don’t know what the intent of the legislature is. We don’t know for what purpose the laws are made. This causes great inconvenience to the people …”The CJI is spot on. His distress deserves the collective consideration of every Member of Parliament (MP). Given that the entire monsoon session of Parliament was wiped out without a single substantive discussion of any consequence, except for one debate on Covid-19 mismanagement in the Rajya Sabha, it brings into question the legitimacy of the institution of Parliament.Moreover, 22 bills were pushed through both Houses of Parliament by the government without any deliberation in either House. This constitutes a clear violation of Article 107 of the Constitution of India, and the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in both Houses of Parliament.For over three decades now, disruption has become the norm and the functioning of Parliament, the exception. The day the House functions, it makes headlines.This raises two obvious questions: Are disruptions a legitimate parliamentary tactic by the Opposition, and can an obdurate government just stymie discussion and debate in the House leveraging the despotism of numbers?The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) set the benchmark of disruptions. In August 2012, justifying the wipeout of the winter session of 2010 and the monsoon session of 2012, the then leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Arun Jaitley, argued, “If parliamentary accountability is subverted and a debate is intended to be used merely to put a lid on parliamentary accountability, it is then a legitimate tactic for the Opposition to expose the government through parliamentary instruments available at its command... We are not interested in a debate. What is there to debate?” he told an English news channel. The thrust of his argument was that disruption is a legitimate parliamentary tactic.His colleague, leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Sushma Swaraj, was equally vociferous when she said, “Not allowing Parliament to function is a form of democracy like any other form… Debate under (Rule) 193 would mean a ‘talkout’ by the government and a walkout by the Opposition. If we had taken debate under (Rule) 184, they would have won because they have numbers.”These words set the stage for what has followed in the past nine years. The Opposition, at least the Indian National Congress (INC), may well be justified in sticking it to the government for what it endured for 10 years at the hands of the NDA/Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) between 2004-2014, but where does that leave the supreme temple of democracy?In an informal conversation with the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, I suggested a way out. When government business finishes at 6 pm, the Speaker should allow a Rule 193 discussion in the Lok Sabha, and under a corresponding rule in the Rajya Sabha every day on a subject of the Opposition’s choice till 9 pm. Under rule 193 of the Lok Sabha, any member who wishes to raise a discussion on a matter of urgent public importance may write to the secretary-general precisely specifying the matter to be raised. It is rare in practice that the Opposition seriously wants a discussion under Rule 184 that also entails voting, even though it may table notices daily more as a tactic. No-confidence motions are, in any case, a rarity.This, however, would require large-heartedness and a supreme degree of magnanimity by the treasury benches to acquiesce to a discussion every day on a subject of the Opposition’s choice, even if it does not entail a vote at the end of it. What the government would gain, however, is a meaningful discussion on government bills, an interruption-free question hour, and a disturbance-free zero hour. Even private member’s business, which has not even once been transacted substantively in the Lok Sabha since May 2019, would start taking place. A small but significant concession by the government could pave the way for the supreme legislative institution to function harmoniously. The biggest beneficiary would be the institution of Parliament itself.There is also a robust need for restructuring the institution of the presiding officers of both Houses of Parliament. The two essential attributes of a presiding officer must be autonomy of decision-making and exacting neutrality — this is hard to achieve if both the Speaker of the Lok Sabha as well as the chair of the Rajya Sabha (vice-president of India) are elected as nominees of one or the other political party at the inception of their office. While the vice-president resigns from the political party he is affiliated to, the Speaker continues to retain membership in the political party. However, ideological commitment runs deeper than pro-forma disassociation.With no affront contemplated, much less intended, to the current Speaker or chairperson or their revered forerunners, the time has come to seriously deliberate on whether or not presiding officers of both Houses should be serving judges of the Supreme Court on lien and appointed for five years in case of the Lok Sabha and six years for the Rajya Sabha. This would ensure that truly dispassionate referees conduct the proceedings of both Houses of Parliament. A similar practice must be adopted for state legislatures with presiding officers requested from respective high courts.Insofar as the CJI’s concern about tardy lawmaking goes, to improve it, as I have been repeatedly arguing through two private member’s Bills, in 2010 and then again in 2019, the rigours of the anti-defection law would have to be relaxed, and whip-driven tyranny circumscribed to only those motions that impact the continuance and stability of the government.The legislative space needs to be freed up for MPs and Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs) to start taking a renewed interest in their primary function making good laws for the nation as well as the states respectively. Legislators needs to be liberated and empowered again by making them feel that their vote counts, and that when they dissent because of the imperatives of constituency, commonsense or conscience, their membership of the House would not become a casualty that it currently does if a whip is violated.Moreover, it must be prescribed in the rules of procedure that no bill be passed in either House without it being referred to a standing/select committee for comprehensive scrutiny. This would make Parliament function around the year rather than just four months annually.Parliament has to be rescued from what it has currently descended into — a gladiatorial arena to seize executive power, with disruption deployed as a maximalist strategy. This is only exacerbating the death spiral of an institution grappling with a serious crisis of credibility.Manish Tewari is a lawyer, MP, former I&B minister, and Congress leader The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/restoring-the-integrity-of-the-indian-parliament-101629541992298.html
21-08-2021||Today's||In the 1960s, the Kabul of my childhood||They say the city you most fondly remember is the one you grew up in. In my case, that’s Kabul. I spent my formative years in the Afghan capital in the mid-1960s. It was a very different time, and Afghanistan, a very different country. But the Kabul that’s imprinted on my mind belongs to that decade.It was a happy city. No other description does it justice. Of course, it was poor, conservative, and hierarchical, but people were always smiling. They were warm, welcoming, courteous, and generous. This was most obvious in their attitude to children. Everyone called me “bacho”. When mummy took me out, shopkeepers would slip Hershey’s chocolates or Spearmint gum into my hands, and then seal my lips with their fingers. It was our little secret and it made a nine-year-old feel special.Every morning, Khan Mohammad would hold my hand and walk me from the ambassador’s residence, past the Italian embassy, to the corner of Ariana Hotel to await the school bus. Across the road was Dilkusha Palace. A little further was Pashtunistan Square and Khyber Restaurant, famous for its beef steaks and lemon meringue pies.Daddy’s office, as I called it, was in Sharinau, not far from what later became famous as Chicken Street. In the 1960s, it was literally a place to buy fowl. Carpets and antiques were nowhere to be seen. The birds were crammed into wire-mesh coops. Mummy would pick her choice and the chicken would be slaughtered in the jui (drain) that ran alongside it. She would look the other way, but I was transfixed by the gruesome slaughter.Old Kabul lay beyond Pashtunistan Square. It was a warren of shops surrounding the Pul-e-Chisti Mosque, an amalgam of money lenders, jewellers, second-hand clothes stores, naan bakeries, and dingy little supermarkets. In fact, there was nothing “super” about them, but the American term had caught the Afghan fancy.The grandest hotel was the eponymous Kabul. The Inter-Continental was still a few years into the future, The Serena, decades away. But there was a delightful Swiss hostelry called Spinzar. Its pastry was delectable. It overlooked the Kabul river and stood at the end of a long row of little shops selling Afghanistan’s prized Karakul caps.On Fridays, we would drive to Kargah Lake, just beyond the city limits, or even further, to Paghman, where the royal family and aristocracy had summer homes. The restaurant at Kargah was rather posh. But I preferred the handcarts selling candy-floss and Coca-Cola in old-fashioned bottles.Society, in the Victorian sense, was small, but sophisticated. The upper classes spoke better French than English, but they all warmed to Indian classical music. Vilayat Khan and Amjad Ali were favourites. Hindi films were adored, and Dilip Kumar was every Afghan’s hero.The rich lived behind high-walled compounds. Outside, some women wore burkhas. Indoors, however, it was Chanel dresses and high-heeled shoes. They smoked American cigarettes held by carefully manicured fingers with bright red nail polish.Those were innocent days. Grass grew in gardens and dates were numbers on a calendar. Even parents were incredulously trusting. When Daddy fell ill, he was surprised at how often the princes would drop by, until it dawned the real attraction was his daughters.Much of today’s Kabul didn’t exist. Wazire Akbar Khan was a vast barren spread. From our upstairs balcony, there was an unbroken view all the way to the Pakistani residence. The American ambassador lived opposite the Indian Chancery. The present-day United States compound was scrubland. It was here, when he was free and feeling indulgent, that Daddy taught me to drive.I studied at the American School at Karte Chaur. A little further was Dar-ul-Aman Palace, built by Amanullah in the early 1900s. If we didn’t go to Kargah, we would spend Friday afternoons swimming in the palace pool.When Mummy found that I’d acquired an American twang and started saying “aloominum” (for aluminium), she packed me off to school in Dehradun. She was determined to protect her son’s accent. But that didn’t cure my taste for peanut butter. I have it every day at breakfast and each bite brings Kabul back to mind. Unlike poet Robert Graves, I cannot say “Good-bye to all that”.Karan Thapar is the author of Devil’s Advocate: The Untold StoryThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-the-1960s-the-kabul-of-my-childhood-101629541990926.html
21-08-2021||Today's||India needs more women in the police||A young girl in Gurugram, who was relentlessly stalked, died by suicide recently. Attempts by her desperate father to intervene led to the stalker apologising, but did not deter him from continuing to harass the girl.According to the National Crime Records Bureau report 2020, there were 9,438 reported cases of stalking in 2018. But, many more do not come to light as women don’t report them to the police for fear of being blamed themselves or not getting timely help. Worrying data issued by Delhi Police shows that crimes against women in the national Capital saw a 63.3% increase in the first six months of 2021.The police station is the first port of call in the criminal justice system. And it is there that many women face the first barriers: Of not being taken seriously; not being able to submit forensic evidence in time; and, being made to feel uncomfortable in a largely male-dominated environment.One solution would be to have more women in the police force. On this front, there is positive news. There has been a 16% increase in women personnel entering the police force between 2019 and the beginning of 2020. However, women still constitute only 10.3% of the force.Following a 2009 Government of India advisory, almost all Union Territories and nine states decided on a target of 33% reservation for women in the police. But targets don’t always translate into actual numbers on the ground.Usha Rangnani, deputy commissioner of police, southwest Delhi, firmly believes that more women in the force would lead to more women reporting incidents of violence against them. “I have begun an initiative of having an all-women force in one area under my jurisdiction. They interact with women in the area, draw them out about any violence that they may be experiencing either at home or in public places, provide counselling and legal advice on options available to them.”She says that crimes against women cannot be tackled without involving men, so her officers also engage with men and older women in the area. “Seeing my officers and the respect that they command, I find that more girls in the locality are keen on joining the force. Women feel safer and more confident in coming forward. I feel that women officers have more empathy for them and respect boundaries when dealing with women who have suffered violence.”Harmeet Singh, commissioner of police in Guwahati, feels that more women in police stations make it easier and more friendly for women to register a complaint. “Women bring an intuitive capacity to the job and they tend to be on the cutting-edge of policing wherever they are in charge. Make no mistake, women are very tough and capable as officers. I think women being comfortable with more women police officers is one positive aspect of gender inclusion.”The decision not to report violence to the police is governed by several factors, among them the fear of stigma, victim-shaming, and a resigned acceptance of violence. Kalpana Vishwanath, director of Safetipin and chairperson of Jagori, a women’s resource centre says, “Many women are too scared to come to a station, so the police must engage in community outreach as a way of helping women.”More women police personnel, proactive gender sensitisation across the force and the localities they work in, and taking policing out of the station to women, hold the key to a safer environment for women in both rural and urban India.lalita.panicker@hindustantimes.comThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/india-needs-more-women-in-the-police-101629541989958.html
21-08-2021||Today's||India at 75: Can the twain ever meet?||Landmark occasions provide unique opportunities for calm, nonpartisan reflection with a unique blend of nostalgia, pride, hope, fear, and poignance. We have made tremendous progress, but Rabindranath Tagore’s exhortation in the Gitanjali compendium, to value reason above all faculties, must make us ask some existential questions. Where are we going as a nation? Are we inculcating the independence of spirit, thought and scientific enquiry? In a largely atavistic society, are we building basic enablers to reverse an inherent resistance to change, or will the intellectually marginalised continue to be deprived of modern education and subject to constant indoctrination?Beyond the markets, are we building a sustainable society? Northern Europe’s sustainable initiatives are global benchmarks for building egalitarian societies. Its political and corporate leadership ensures permeation of this core ethic to its smallest units — individuals. Lopsided post-pandemic economic recovery will aggravate the inherent inequities globally — especially in structurally unequal societies such as India, South Africa and Brazil.A Financial Times article contrasts Zomato founder’s $650 million net worth with its gig workers eking out a living with ₹20 per trip to deliver food, while battling growing unemployment which saw 200 million people slipping into poverty. The concentration of economic power with the migration of unorganised business to corporate entities has been a discernible trend with the likes of Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani leading perhaps what is India’s answer to Russian oligarchs.Further, social divides based on religion, caste and class create increasing levels of polarisation as does rapidly receding trust in the institutions of governance inherent in a liberal democracy. Such a concoction is lethal to the social order, as was recently witnessed in what has been South Africa’s worst violence since apartheid.Changing the narrative is critical today. This can happen only if we transcend the mental barrier to differentiate between truth and maya (eternal illusion). There is no way to do this other than building scientific thought and temperament across all levels. The Parliament adopted the Science Policy Resolution in 1958 — the foundational vision of modern India. Sadly, instead of promoting introspection, debate and encouraging innovative thinkers to dispassionately challenge the status quo, we are witnessing a frightening regression into a world built on myths, prejudice, bias, and irrationality.Examples of the current public leadership enthusiastically promoting cow urine as a cure for cancer, or coronil for Covid are part of our national folklore. Author Yuval Noah Harari postulates that religion is the most enduring story ever told, and till today, is used to determine who we should hate, or our actions based on superstitions propagated in its name.Going back into the past is easy — the further, the better. As is tapping into cultural sentiments at the cost of rational, scientific thinking. Politicians play this game the world over to consolidate power with the neo-imperialism in Russia and Vladimir Putin — the new Czar — being an obvious example. However, in a complex multicultural, multi-ethnic, religiously diverse society such as India, utilising the direct link between scientific thought and secularism can prove profoundly hermetic.Their supportive interplay will change the paradigm from dogma and sectarian thinking to critical reasoning and intellectual cosmopolitanism, hence building on our society’s inherent diversity rather than remaining spellbound by the enduring charm of Britain’s parting gift of deep communal hatred in 1947.At its core is the ability of science to confront the truth and the willingness to acknowledge facts. Regrettably, commencing with creeping data integrity issues in the budget documents from 2011, it has now transmuted to various statistical figures, including underreporting cases and deaths, where floating dead bodies jarred us to the state of data integrity challenges today.Cognitive dissonance in policymaking displaces the delicacy of reasoned debate in Parliament and adds to the toxicity of doubt and suspicion even for well-intended decisions. Active policy consultation with domain experts is a natural casualty in such an environment with many preferring to resign rather than erode credibility. The resignations of the chief economic adviser, heads of the National Statistical Commission, Niti Aayog and the Covid-19 scientific advisory group, INSACOG are some recent instances.In a post-truth world, bringing the truth back to politics can change the paradigm. Tagore’s Satyer Abohan examines the relationship between individuals and the nation from this prism of truth. Elected leaders must lead this change. Susan Stebbing’s 1939 classic shows that in politics emotive language is often disguised as scientific language, and then used as slogans. She warns, though, that if well-meaning slogans succumb under scientific scrutiny, they should be discarded in any rational argument.Given our unparalleled record of missed opportunities for balanced, sustainable economic growth with equitable social development, we face massive problems to solve today. This is achievable only if the leadership enlists the involvement of all. Post-Independence, our founding fathers took on the challenge despite being devoid of the stature and resources we have today. Admittedly, many decisions proved to be wrong in hindsight, but the foundations for a modern India built and nurtured over decades must be acknowledged.In a naive and unreflective age where we celebrate too early, too much, and frivolously, we must evolve by continuously introspecting and making course corrections. Large scale alienation of citizens led by rising economic inequalities and social inequities cannot be ignored as we celebrate our hard-earned Independence. Nation-building is much more than rising markets benefitting only a handful.It is time to change the narrative with the singular imperative of making the twain meet. Sustainable progress will follow.Prabal Basu Roy is a Sloan fellow of the London Business School, non-executive director, and an adviser to chairmen of corporate boardsThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/india-at-75-can-the-twain-ever-meet-101629541988435.html
