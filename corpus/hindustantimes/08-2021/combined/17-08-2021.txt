According to BMC officials, another 25 such EV charging stations are expected to come up in the city.Thackeray on Tuesday tweeted, “This is very encouraging as we move in the direction of making Maharashtra electric vehicle-friendly. We had announced our state’s electric vehicle (EV) policy about a month ago. It is heartening to witness such efforts from all fronts. This is one of the many steps, over the next few months we want to ensure that every PPL has an electric charging station.”According to BMC officials, there are two types of EV chargers of which one is DC charger, that is known as a fast charger, which charges a vehicle in around 60 to 110 minutes, and the other is AC charger in which an EV is charged within six to seven hours. At the Kohinoor PPL, BMC has installed two DC chargers that will charge four vehicles at a time, and three slow chargers that will charge three vehicles at a time. The charging station will be available 24x7.A total of 72 EVs can be charged in a span of 24 hours at the facility and the cost of charging will be ₹15 per unit. In general, it takes around 20 to 30 units for an EV to be fully charged, so the total charging cost would be between ₹200 and ₹400. A fully-charged EV can be driven for around 140km to 170km.BMC has around 26 PPLs in the city and the civic body is planning to install such EV charging stations at all of them in the coming months. Apart from the 26 PPLs, BMC also operates several on-street parking lots in the city. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner, said, “Not just for on-street parking lots, but we are also going to explore mobile EV charging station. By this, a charging station can be installed inside a vehicle and via that point any electric vehicle can be charged on the road. This is even done in European cities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-opens-first-public-ev-charging-station-25-more-on-cards-101629224802158.html
17-08-2021||Mumbai||MPCB to install 15 mobile air quality monitors across Maharashtra||The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) plans to install 15 mobile continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMS) at key locations across the state, including Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Thane, Pune and others. MPCB last week floated a request for proposal (RFP) inviting prospective concessionaires to bid for the project, which is expected to be rolled out in the first half of 2022, according to officials privy to the development.The 15 air quality monitors will be housed in Bharat Stage-IV compliant trucks which will be stationed outside various regional offices of MPCB in at least eight districts, according to tender documents reviewed by Hindustan Times. They will be fitted with continuous automatic monitoring devices for carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NO,NO2, NOx), beta attenuation gauges to measure PM2.5 and PM10 pollution levels, and a BTX analyser to measure atmospheric concentrations of other pollutants including benzene, toluene ethyl benzene, and three isomers of xylene.They will also be fitted with instruments to measure meteorological parameters such as wind direction, wind speed, ambient temperature, relative humidity, rainfall and solar radiation.Once a year, at three days’ notice, the entire unit and its operations will be subject to audit by MPCB to ensure quality control. Other locations shortlisted for installation of mobile CAAQMS include Chandrapur, Amravati, Kolhapur, Nashik, Aurangabad and Nagpur. VM Motghare, director (air quality) at MPCB, did not comment when contacted on Tuesday. However, a regional officer with MPCB aware of the development said, “These mobile stations will be located primarily outside regional offices of MPCB, where they will operate on a routine basis and take air samples every 15 minutes or so. The data will also be relayed to the Central Pollution Control Board’s servers so that it can be used to generate a more accurate air quality index. At the discretion of regional officers, the units may be deployed elsewhere. For example, if there is a fire somewhere and we want to assess the air pollution, we can move the unit elsewhere temporarily.”The official also said that this is the second time in a year that tenders for the project are being invited. “The tenders for the same were first released in August 2020, and four bidders had come forward, but the commercials could not be worked out. Hence the tenders are now being re-invited and the bid should be awarded sometime in late September-early October. Once awarded, the concessionaire will have a timeline of 180 days to start operations,” the official said.Mumbai’s currently has 30 air quality monitoring stations — 15 under MPCB, 10 under the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), and five under the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). In addition to these, MPCB has proposed to install three more stationary CAAQMS in Navi Mumbai, Kalamboli, Kharghar and Taloja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mpcb-to-install-15-mobile-air-quality-monitors-across-maharashtra-101629224500319.html

International flights are already operating in between two countries like Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. So we should reciprocate the same way,” TTAG president Nilesh Shah said after the meeting with the chief minister.The industry is facing “severe financial constraints” and even a limited reopening of the industry would go a long way in improving the health of the industry, the stakeholders said.They have sought that the Goa government should now announce a conditional reopening of the state for foreign tourists, subject to the coronavirus situation being under control in order that they can plan for the upcoming season.“We request an announcement to be made immediately for the opening of international tourist charters from October onwards so that foreign operators have time to market and prepare for the operations and this coming season is not lost. If by any chance there is any third wave of Covid-19 then the announcement of the cancellation of charter operations can be made by September or October,” the TTAG said.To encourage tourists to travel, the TTAG has suggested a special charter tourist package visa to be worked out which can be issued manually by the local embassies or temporary landing permits can be issued on arrival to tourists, as done in the past.According to industry estimates, the tourism sector employs over 40 million skilled and trained manpower and generates approximately US $29 billion foreign exchange per annum for the country.No new foreign tourists have set foot in Goa since March last year after the country shut its borders to leisure travel and stopped issuing tourist visas.Prior to the pandemic, the state witnessed close to 90-lakh tourists including around 9-lakh foreigners.Goa Tourism Development Corporation had conducted a state-wise survey through a consultant to understand the impact of Covid-19 on the state’s tourism industry. As per the survey, the overall loss of earnings in the tourism industry during lockdown has been estimated at ₹2,062 crores. Potential loss of earning for the 2020-21 season has been pegged at ₹7,239 crores and the potential job cuts were to the tune of 1.22 lakh (58%).Goa’s tourism sector is a big source of revenue for the state with the industry directly contributing 16.43% towards the state Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and also provides employment to nearly 35% of the state’s population that is dependent on the sector, according to official estimates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/goa-tourism-seeks-restart-of-foreign-arrivals-from-safe-countries-101629224320637.html
17-08-2021||Other||JNU academic council approves proposal to establish medical school, 500-bed super-speciality hospital||New Delhi: The Academic Council (AC) of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Tuesday approved the proposal of establishing a medical school and a 500-bed super-speciality hospital on the university campus, amid opposition by some council members who described it as an attempt to change the character of JNU and commercialisation of a public university. The JNU teachers’ association (JNUTA) also opposed the decision and wrote to the union education ministry to register its dissent. HT on Tuesday reported that the university has proposed to establish a medical school and hospital offering super speciality treatment, including critical services in cardiology, organ transplant, neurology, and pulmonology, along with “non-conventional departments” with 50% faculty posts reserved for scientists. The cost of the project is estimated at ₹900 crore.The matter will now be placed before the university’s top decision making body-- the executive council (EC)-- in its next meeting for the final approval, officials said.In a statement issued on Tuesday, JNU rector RP Singh, who is also a member of the committee that prepared the proposal, said, “The Academic Council unanimously approved, as per the provisions of JNU Act 1966, establishing a School of Medical Sciences and an attached hospital with broad and super speciality departments including supporting and non-conventional departments.”The school will offer courses at undergraduate, postgraduate and research levels with an “emphasis on modern medicine integrated with traditional medicine and knowledge systems from humanities and Social Sciences,” the statement added. However, some council members alleged that they were not allowed to register dissent over the matter during the meeting that was held virtually in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. “I was not allowed to speak. In fact, they did not unmute me throughout the discussion over the proposal. This is nothing but another way of changing the character of JNU and commercialisation of a public university. At least two other members raised substantive issues regarding the resources and environmental impact that it might have on the campus. But their concerns were brushed aside,” said a member, who asked not to be named. Later on Tuesday, JNUTA also wrote to union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan raising concerns over the proposal. “The 158th academic council meeting saw the vice-chancellor seeking AC approval for the establishment of a medical school and a super specialty hospital within JNU, without any major prior discussion on the feasibility of such a programme among faculty belonging to the Centre for Social Medicine and Community Health and other related schools. On matters as important as the conduct of JNU Entrance Examinations 2021-22, the vice-chancellor chose to simply inform the AC about the decisions taken already instead of following the procedural norms laid out in the university statutes,” the teachers body said in the letter.The plan to set up a medical sciences school and the hospital involves hiring 259 faculty members and the total estimated budget of the project is ₹900 crore. The project will be completed in three years, officials said.The JNUTA also questioned the delay in appointment of a regular vice-chancellor in JNU. M Jagadesh Kumar’s tenure as JNU V-C was to end on January 26, but the education ministry on January 22 directed that Kumar be allowed to continue in his position ‘until further orders’. Despite several attempts, Kumar and JNU rector did not respond to calls and texts sent for a comment. An education ministry official said, “The recruitment process is going on. A decision is likely to be made soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jnu-academic-council-approves-proposal-to-establish-medical-school-500-bed-super-speciality-hospital-101629224198890.html
17-08-2021||Lucknow||SP members create ruckus over ‘abba jaan’ comment||LUCKNOW Samajwadi Party (SP) members on Tuesday created a ruckus in the Vidhan Parishad and trooped into the well, taking exception to chief minister Yogi Adityanath referring to former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav’s father (Mulayam Singh Yadav) as ‘abba jaan’. He did not name anyone, though. Giving reply to the pandemic related questions raised under Rule 105 in the Upper House, the CM said people who opposed the Covid vaccine calling it “the BJP’s vaccine” must be held accountable for many avoidable deaths of people who got infected and died because of not taking a jab believing the propaganda. “But the same persons, who opposed the vaccine, agreed to take the shot later, after their ‘abba jaan’ was vaccinated,” the CM quipped, evoking a sharp reaction from the SP members who accused Adityanath of using “unparliamnetary language in the Upper House.” Yogi Adityanath said he was surprised to see that the SP had objection to the use of the words ‘abba jaan’ even as the party was always desperate to get Muslim votes. Chairman Kumar Manvendra Singh, who was conducting the proceedings, said there was nothing unparliamentary about calling someone ‘abba jaan’ and succeeded in calming members down after 10 minutes of commotion. Resuming the speech, the CM said the SP members were preaching him on the use of parliamentary words here while one of their MPs (he did not name) was seen in the morning shamelessly defending the Taliban and their barbaric acts. “We are in a parliamentary democracy, but we are supporting acts that are a blot on humanity,” he regretted. Attacking the opposition, the CM said when the state and the Central governments were making arrangements to save lives of people during the second wave of Covid, politicians of opposition camp were busy spreading negativity through twitter. “When the country and the state were in crisis, these people were spreading fears, goading people and creating anarchy through twitter,” he alleged He admitted to problems during the second wave but said the government did its best to deal with the situation. Referring to the opposition’s allegations about bodies found flouting in the Ganga during the second wave, Adityanath said bodies were also found floating in the Ganga in Kanpur and Unnao during the SP regime. Dumping of bodies in the Ganga, he said, was, in fact, a part of the Sanatan culture and tradition. The CM said Covid was not an ordinary disease and people must accept this reality. He said coordinated efforts were needed to deal with this pandemic and advised the opposition to desist from using death statistics to further their political agenda. He claimed that Covid positivity rate in UP (0.01%) was the lowest in the world and recovery rate was as high as 98.6%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sp-members-create-ruckus-over-abba-jaan-comment-101629223899281.html

The call for the two-day strike, that will continue till Wednesday, was given by Delhi University Teachers Association (DUTA) to protest against delayed salary disbursal and the government for not releasing funds. The issues of delayed payments and not releasing funds on time have been a point of contention among the colleges and Delhi government for a while now. Earlier in March this year, the Delhi government announced that it would release ₹28.24 crores for the salaries of the staff of the fully funded DU colleges. Despite the announcement, insufficient grants were released, that delayed disbursement of salaries and other dues, said the DUTA. President of DUTA Rajib Ray said though some principals had called to inform that funds had been sanctioned, this was a stop gap measure that would cover up expenses for a month or two at the most. “The budget sanctioned for colleges should have been increased, but it has not been done. Besides salaries of teachers, colleges have expenses to incur on infrastructure also,” said Ray. In a statement, DUTA said while grant-in-aid had been released earlier for some colleges, the strike will continue. “The second instalment of grants-in-aid released today (Tuesday) is highly insufficient. DUTA finds it is extremely unfortunate that it takes protests to get salaries. All dues of employees remain still pending including against medical bills and salaries of ad-hoc teachers. The grants released are insufficient for the implementation of recent promotions in terms of salary enhancement,” the statement said. Besides boycotting classes, teachers also held an online protest during which they shared their grievances and the challenges they are facing due to delay in payment of salaries. “Teachers shared how employees are forced to take loans because of these delays and are living in constant stress. They demanded that the 12 colleges should be taken over by the UGC to end this repeated crisis,” said DUTA. Hem Chand Jain, principal of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College, said he did not receive any sanction letter or funds, due to which college teachers were going through trying times. The college last paid 80% salaries to teaching staff in May, whereas ad-hoc and contractual teachers were given no remuneration. “Colleges are in a bad shape. The livelihoods of around 2,500 families are at stake. People are unable to pay their EMIs. The college has not been able to pay the electricity and water bill. We are not in a position to pay for expenses incurred under different heads,” said Jain. The Delhi government did not respond to calls and messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/teachers-on-2-day-strike-over-salary-delay-at-12-delhi-university-colleges-101629223838688.html

The callers managed to convince Khan to share his ATM password and bank account information. And within minutes, the money from his bank account vanished to different accounts.Retired sub-inspector, Udai Veer Singh, of Hardoi district, was duped of ₹10 lakh from his bank account. In his case, the callers again posed as treasury officers and managed to procure his ATM and bank account details.Similarly, serving sub-inspector Ram Lakhan Chowdhary and a retired woman constable were defrauded of ₹10 lakh and ₹ 9 lakh, respectively.A retired secretariat official in Lucknow was conned out of ₹53 lakh in the same manner.A senior police official of the UP police Cyber Crime Cell said a notorious cyber fraudster, Vijay Mandal alias Pramod Mandal, who along with his accomplice, Mantu Mandal, was arrested on Sunday, was the mastermind behind all these frauds. He was also behind the fraud with at least 37 retired government officials in the past few months.He said that all victims fell prey to the same trick of unknown callers posing as treasury officers, who offered them government schemes and retirement benefits, after which they shared their ATM and bank account details.The official said that Pramod Mandal and Mantu Mandal, both residents of Jharkhand, had formed a gang along with some relatives and friends after training them about cyber fraud tricks. He said five more members of the gang have been identified and efforts are on to nab them too.He said Pramod Mandal had assigned specific tasks to his gang members like opening false bank accounts for money transactions and obtaining fake SIM cards for making calls to victims. Some members were trained in making calls to victims while some were given know-how in withdrawing money from bank accounts. They were given a certain amount of money based on the importance of their task.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/jharkhand-cyber-cheats-gang-swindled-37-retd-up-police-govt-officials-in-past-few-months-101629223599015.html

Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had had announced in his budget speech in March that the Delhi government will set up virtual schools “from next year” to facilitate easy learning for students from across the country who wanted to benefit from “Delhi model of education”.“Initially, the school will begin with about 200 students in classes 9 and 11, and later expand to other classes. Similarly, at the beginning, the focus will be on students residing within Delhi and it will progressively expand to the other parts of the country at a later stage,” said an official document from the education department on the project, which was reviewed by HT. The document doesn’t state by when the virtual school will be launched.“Teaching-learning in the virtual school will comprise of two elements- synchronous learning, in which students will connect with teachers through live online classes; and asynchronous learning, in which students will refer to audio-visual and textual content to enhance mastery over their subjects of choice,” it further stated.The schools will be governed by the Delhi Schools of Specialized Excellence Society and will be affiliated with the newly formed Delhi Board of Secondary Education (DBSE), which had recently signed a collaboration agreement with the International Baccalaureate board to develop its course curriculum.The education department has issued tenders inviting external partners to bid for the operationalisation process, which includes creating learning management system (LMS), teacher training modules, establishing and maintaining two high-quality production studios for recording or live streaming lectures, along with other logistics and operations. The bids will be closed later this month.Under DVMS, the document said, the evaluation of learning goals will be conducted through “technology assisted assessments, which will be conducted on the LMS and, if necessary, at designated assessment centres across the city”. Students will also be assessed through quizzes, assignments, live assessments, and proctored examinations.According to the plan, the education department will set up a scalable LMS platform which can be accessed on various devices, including phones, tablets and laptops.It will also host an array of teaching-learning functions, ranging from live-streaming sessions which will be saved in a virtual library along with other learning content; creating and sharing documents like worksheets, slides, and projects; assigning and evaluating paperless assignments; maintaining the class calendars; conducting virtual conversations; and creating an artificial intelligence-based interface to create a personalised flow based on the learning level of each student.The plan document said that all teachers and students will have a unique ID provided by the school administration which will be registered on the domain. “All student devices should have AI-enabled applications for online content. This application should have an LMS system to track the learning growth of students,” the document stated.The teacher training programme will include elements on the usage of online platforms and IT infrastructure; lesson planning, content and assignment creation; incorporation of multimedia content in teaching pedagogy; and soft skills for conducting online classes.A senior official of the education department said, “There will a combination of senior experienced teachers of the Delhi government schools as well as external experts who will be roped in to conduct classes for the students. While we will start with 200 students, it can go up to any number in later stages. Admission process will be finalised once we rope in our partner organisations.”Educationist Meeta Sengupta said the Delhi government will have to work on the credibility and acceptance of the school. “The idea behind virtual schools is to create a legitimate option for those students who cannot opt for mainstream education. However, the outcome from the virtual school has to be good enough to attract students who are looking for opportunities after school. The government should also focus on teachers’ training as teachers will have to shift their mindset and value the multi-lens approach of teaching-learning. The government could also link these schools to the new Skill University so that various choices can open up for students,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-virtual-model-school-to-begin-with-200-students-in-classes-9-and-11-101629223538675.html

That led us to an ice-cream vendor near the girl’s house. When we questioned the vendor, he said he found that the SIM card in a ₹500 currency note that the girl had given him. He claimed that he didn’t suspect anything amiss and used the card. With his help, we traced the girl’s house and questioned her and her family and found out about the man’s decomposed body buried in the house,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural).The police said that they the exact age of the girl was unknown.“We exhumed the body in presence of a magistrate and sent it for autopsy. Once we get that report, we will be able to establish the cause of death. The family of the victim has now lodged a murder complaint with us,” said the SP.Officials familiar with the development said that, according to their mobile phone records and statements from other residents of the locality, the victim and the girl knew each other for past two years.The victim’s uncle, Mohammad Babu, said they had no previous grudge against the family.“My nephew was having dinner when he received a call on the night of August 11. He excused himself suddenly and went out and never returned. We searched for him everywhere but to no avail. We knew that he had some connection with the girl, but we had never made an issue out of it. We suspect that her family may have called him through the girl and later murdered him,” said Mohammad Babu.The police said that based on the complaint given by victim’s family, they have launched investigation and were questioning the girl, her elder sister, mother and brother.According to officials familiar with case investigation, the girl told police that the man killed himself in the house and they buried his body out of fear. But the officials said that the manner in which she disposed of the SIM card seemed to have been a deliberate attempt to hide something.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-missing-man-s-body-found-buried-in-female-friend-s-house-101629223298523.html

Police said that the suspects had stolen around 100 motorcycles in the city in the last one year. The suspects were identified as Rupendra Kumar, 24, a native of Aligarh; Sumit Thakur, 25, a native of Purnia in Bihar; and Anup Mishra, 23, a native of Hardoi in Uttar Pradesh. They lived in a rented accommodation in Noida Phase 2, police said. Sujeet Upadhyaya, station house officer (SHO), Phase 2 police station, said that police had received a complaint of motorcycle theft two weeks ago. “We launched an investigation. On Monday night, three men riding a motorcycle near Sector 90 T-Point were stopped for checking by a police team. They failed to produce the vehicle’s registration papers,” Upadhyaya said. During interrogation, the suspects revealed that they had stolen the motorcycle from outside a power sub-station in Noida’s Sector 85 on August 4, 2021, police said. Amit Kumar, an official of the power department, had filed the complaint the same day at Phase 2 police station in this regard. Amit said that his motorcycle was stolen from outside the power sub-station. The SHO said that the suspects also revealed that they had hidden 11 other stolen motorcycles in the bushes in Sector 85. Later, the police team conducted a search and recovered these motorcycles. “The suspects had doctored the registration number plates of some of the motorcycles. In the last one year, they had stolen around 100 motorcycles from different places in the city. They used to steal motorcycles and hide them in buses for a few days. Later, they would sell them to people in Noida villages,” said the SHO. The three suspects were produced in court that sent them to judicial custody, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/three-members-of-vehicle-lifters-gang-arrested-12-motorcycles-recovered-101629223239280.html
17-08-2021||Noida||Soon, Noida to provide e-bikes for last mile connectivity||The Noida Authority has decided to procure 350 electric bikes (e-bikes) that commuters can rent at a cost of ₹2/minute for their last mile connectivity, and launch by next month. The authority has developed 62 parking sites for the vehicles in Sectors 6, 67, 14 and 16A and other sectors, said officials aware of the development. The authority will set up more parking sites once they observe a growing demand for electric bikes among commuters, said officials. “We are talking to firms that deal in e-bikes and have already helped other cities such as Delhi and Gurugram to run similar services. However, the date and other details are still being worked out,” said S P Singh, deputy general manager of the Noida traffic cell, a department of the Noida Authority.The authority will engage an agency that will develop a mobile application for users to engage these vehicles from the parking sites that will also serve as charging points. The authority is yet to decide on the number of e-bikes each station will serve.“The agency will prepare an application that will help commuters book an e-bike, charge rent and maintain records of users with ease,” said another official from Noida authority who was not authorised to speak to media.The official added that the will earn revenue through the renting model and also own the advertisement space at the 50-square feet stations.  “The agency can give the advertising space on rent to any firm to earn revenue and spend it on running the e-bike service,” said the official. The authority came up with the idea following a demand from the public for better last-mile connectivity in the city. Noida has both Metro and bus service to meet the city’s public transport needs, but covering short distances remains a challenge with commuters having to resort to sharing space on e-rickshaws, auto-rickshaws and cycle-rickshaws. What compounds their problem is the unforgiving traffic jams on the city roads. “A commuter can use the e-bike to reach his or her destination and park the bike at the nearest parking site. The hassle-free service will benefit those, who face difficulty in reaching destinations nearby Metro stations and other routes,” said Singh. Residents said they are glad that the authority has finally decided to move on the issue.“We were waiting for an e-bike service for a long time in the city because last mile connectivity is a big issue here. Travelling from Metro Station or arterial roads to internal destinations is a real trouble. The authority must start it at earliest,” said Swarnima Singh a resident of Sector 135.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/soon-noida-to-provide-e-bikes-for-last-mile-connectivity-101629223238590.html

In her complaint, Soni said she connected with a person who identified himself as Raymond Pedro on Instagram in June.“He said he is a resident of the United Kingdom. We chatted for some time. Later, he told me that he was sending a valuable gift to me. He also said that he was sending some foreign currency,” she said. After a few days, the woman claimed she got a call from a person who identified herself as an officer from India’s customs department and said they needed ₹4 lakh to clear the foreign shipment. According to police, the complainant transferred the money into two bank accounts, but she did not receive the parcel. The alleged customs officer demanded more money and that’s when Soni suspected fraud and filed a complaint with the Noida cyber cell on August 13. The cyber cell conducted a preliminary investigation and then directed the Noida Sector 20 police to register a case. Munish Chauhan, SHO of Sector 20 police station, said a case has been registered against the Instagram profile owner under Indian Penal Code Section 420 (cheating) and under Section 66-D of the IT Act on August 14. “The cyber cell and Noida police are investigating the matter.

17-08-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad has only five active Covid-19 cases, all in home isolation||Nearly five months after the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic that struck Ghaziabad in April, the district on Tuesday was left with just five active cases and all of the patients are in home isolation. Officials of the health department said the district registered no new cases in the past five days and the case positivity rate is at an all-time low. According to the official figures, the district till August 17 had a total of 55,625 cases with 461 deaths and five active cases. The figures also indicate that there have been only 14 cases in the month so far as against 65 in July and 324 in June. The district recorded zero new cases on 10 days out of 17 in the current month, shows the data.“With only five active cases and all in home isolation, we can say that the infection has decreased considerably but it is not finished. So, the Covid appropriate behaviour needs to continue. We also have very low case positivity which is about 0.02% in the current month so far,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer. During the second wave, the district operated with 58 hospitals that provided more than 3,400 Covid beds. The official records show that all the 3,410 dedicated Covid beds, including 1,674 beds with oxygen supplies, 569 ICU beds and 229 ventilator beds, in the district are vacant. “The hospitals have resumed their normal operations. But we still have 20 reserved beds at Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital and several others at our L3 facility at Santosh Medical College. We have also started our preparations for dealing with any likely third wave. Several oxygen plants and paediatric ICU beds have also come up,” Dr Gupta added. The second wave of the pandemic started to spike from mid of April and the trend continued till May. It was on June 26 that Ghaziabad registered zero case for the first time since then. Experts said that no Covid patients are coming to hospitals nowadays. “But we have several cases of viral fever that also has Covid-like symptoms, and as a precautionary measure we are getting such patients tested for Covid-19. The infection has decreased considerably but people must observe all Covid protocols,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). “With the positivity rate at lower level, it is now of prime importance that the vaccination must be expedited and coverage should be increased to avoid a third wave,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-has-only-five-active-covid-19-cases-all-in-home-isolation-101629223178555.html
17-08-2021||Noida||GB Nagar’s Child PGI helps find rare blood group of 2-year-old patient||Doctors at Gautam Budh Nagar’s Postgraduate Institute of Child Health, also known as Child PGI hospital, helped save the life of a two-year-old girl from Meerut who had a rare blood group — B+ but with antibodies against the M blood group .According to Dr Satyam Arora, an associate professor at the hospital, the transfusion medicine department received an emergency call from a private blood bank in Meerut late Friday evening. The patient was suffering from stomach infection with acute dehydration and severe anaemia.“Her haemoglobin count was down to dangerous levels and in order to run any primary treatment she required a blood transfusion. However, the blood bank was unable to finalise the patient’s blood group, nor they were able to find any compatible blood unit,” said Dr Arora.The transfusion medicine department’s advanced immunohematology lab that screens and checks rare blood groups is the only government facility available in western Uttar Pradesh, said officials. Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences and King George’s Medical College in Lucknow are the other two in the state that have a similar set up.The sample was brought to the Child PGI Hospital on Saturday afternoon. The department’s analysis showed that the patient had the rare blood group.There are more than 30 blood group systems, and most people have either A, B, AB or O blood group with a “+” or “-” appended to it denoting the presence or absence of antibodies against the Rhesus antigen in their blood plasma. Transfusion requires patient to receive blood only from those with a matching group or O-, which is known as a universal donor.But the girl had antibodies against the M blood group, which is rarely documented.“The condition has not been quantified in any medical literature hence it is difficult to say how rare it is. Patients receiving multiple transfusion like thalassemia patients, dialysis patients and cancer patients often develop these antibodies. Even mothers who have given multiple births also develops these antibodies. However, in this case, it has been found naturally in the patient, which is rare. It is not a disorder,” said Arora.The presence of the antibody, however, affected the ability of the private lab to figure out the blood group.“It took our team over three hours using rare blood group reagents and rare blood groups panels,” said Dr Arora.Dr Anshuman Sharma, in-charge of the blood bank at Nutema Hospital in Meerut where the girl was being treated, the results helped save her life.“She is from a very poor family and her father is a tailor in a small Meerut village. So far, we have only read such cases in books and medical literature but have never seen it in real life,” said Dr Sharma. “Fortunately, Dr Arora was able to identify the blood group and find a compatible blood unit as well. If the wrong blood unit would have been transfused, the girl would have faced even severe complications for life,” he said.Transfusion Medicine department at Child PGI has developed the advanced lab for GB Nagar and is also providing help (via telemedicine) to blood banks in other districts like Agra and Meerut.“The lab was established in 2019 and since then, over 20 rare blood group transfusion have been supported by the transfusion medicine department, with a majority of patients from GB Nagar and Meerut. The department provides regular training to blood banks in UP and gets many calls for such types of difficult cases,” said Dr Arora.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-s-child-pgi-helps-find-rare-blood-group-of-2-year-old-patient-101629223177959.html

17-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: CHB property owner, buyer can jointly seek inspection||The owner and prospective buyer of a Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) dwelling unit can jointly apply for its inspection to obtain a certificate about there being no violation at the time of property transfer.In a clarification issued on Tuesday, Yashpal Garg, chief executive officer, CHB, said: “In cases where misuse/building violations are not reported as per available record, the information furnished by the applicant in the application form of transfer of dwelling units along with the affidavit of the transferor and transferee are relied upon. In all such cases, fresh inspection is not carried out by the CHB at the time of transfer of units.” However, the applicant/transferee are liable for concealment of facts in the affidavit with respect to misuse and violations, and necessary action can be taken as per law/act/rules accordingly. Further, the transferee continues to be liable for all the building violations either existing at the time of transfer or made subsequently. In cases where reports of violations are available in CHB records, the affidavits about non-violation are not accepted and fresh inspection is carried out by the officials.“It has been observed that in some cases transfer of the unit was allowed on the basis of affidavits, but subsequently certain misuse/building violations were observed. When action was initiated against such violations, the transferees felt cheated as such violations existed at the time of transfer. However, as per the CHB’s stand, the existing owner/occupant (transferee) is liable to remove the violations or bear the consequences, like cancellation of allotment,” said Garg.It is to overcome such a situation and protect the innocent buyers that the board has provided an optional mechanism wherein the transferor and transferee may jointly apply for an inspection by CHB and obtain a certificate about there being no violation at that point of time. “For this purpose, the joint application, along with a fee of ₹5,000, can be submitted by the transferor (existing owner) at the CHB reception,” said Garg.An order on relevant lines was earlier issued on August 27, 2019, and is available on the CHB website. In case any inspection is carried out in violation of these instructions, the board has also warned of strict action against the officials concerned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhchb-property-owner-buyer-can-jointly-seek-inspection-101629223058628.html

The protestors also had a showdown with the police on way to the Vidhan Sabha. Three SP legislators – Rajesh Yadav, Sangram Singh Yadav and Narendra Verma – rode a bullock cart to reach the Vidhan Sabha to protest over farm laws and fuel price hike. They waved the national flag and the SP flag, carried sugarcane and placards and raised slogans all along, till the police stopped them at Hazratganj and refused to let the bullock cart go any further. At Chaudhary Charan Singh’s statue on the Vidhan Sabha premises, nearly a 100 SP legislators gathered and staged a dharna protesting against “poor law and order, three new farm laws, crime against women, rising fuel prices, Covid deaths, Covid management and other issues like unemployment, reservations and caste census.” While a couple of SP legislators climbed the front gate of the Vidhan Bhawan and protested, two legislators wearing oxygen masks shouted slogans like “death due to lack of oxygen during Covid second wave.” SP national president Akhilesh Yadav, who had addressed the Samajwadi Party legislature party meeting on Monday where he said that party legislators will raise public issues both on the streets and in the legislature, was quick on Tuesday to tweet the picture of the SP legislators going to Vidhan Sabha on a bullock cart. He captioned it in Hindi: “Will tell BJP’s lies to all; will show the mirror to BJP people.”Simultaneously with the SP protest, Congress state president Ajay Kumar Lallu (MLA), along with others, reached the Vidhan Sabha on cycle rickshaws. “Congress legislators Ajay Kumar Lallu, Aradhana Mishra (Congress legislators party leader), Deepak Singh, Naseemuddin Siddiqui and Suhail Akhtar reached the Vidhan Sabha on cycle rickshaws. All Congress legislators protested over farmers’ issues, unemployment and price rise. They also had a showdown with the police when cops tried to stop a vegetable cart (to protest price rise) they were taking to the Vidhan Sabha. However, the Congress legislators managed to reach the Assembly on rickshaw,” said the UP Congress Committee in a statement. “We are protesting Covid mismanagement, corruption, price rise, law and order, unemployment, flood mismanagement and issues of cane farmers. To protest, we rode rickshaws and were pushing a vegetable cart from the Congress office. We will also raise the issues in the legislature,” said Ajay Lallu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sp-cong-legislators-ride-bullock-cart-rickshaw-to-protest-price-hike-101629221984044.html

17-08-2021||Lucknow||Afghanistan’s Taliban takeover: jitters for LU’s Afghan students as fears for family, future rise||“I don’t know why God is so angry with my people and my homeland. What have we done to bear years of suffering, to inch towards normalcy before being plunged into darkness again and again,” said a visibly anguished Jawad Majeedy, a 27-year-old Afghan national, studying in Lucknow University.For over a month now, Majeedy was busy talking to his relatives in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan that fell to the Taliban on Monday, completing the Taliban takeover of the war-ravaged country. Majeedy had cautioned and warned his brother and sister living in Kabul to take measures for their safety and had pleaded with them to leave, if possible, but in vain. Now, he has not been able to contact them since Saturday. “I don’t know about their whereabouts. I don’t know if they are hiding, or whether the worst has happened to them. The worst which we all have prayed to God to protect us from,” said Majeedy speaking about his fear of losing loved ones in the ongoing conflict.Close to 60 other Afghan students like Majeedy are enrolled in various courses at Lucknow University. The number of Afghan students at Lucknow University has risen in the last couple of years.“The Taliban are against education. We, who have left our country to get higher education, are not less than an enemy for the Taliban. They only understand the language of guns and will execute us if they come to know about us,” said another student from Afghanistan on condition of anonymity.The Afghan students, including Majeedy, frequent places in Delhi where people who have managed to escape the Taliban, have arrived in the last few weeks. “I know close to 300 people who have sold their belongings and fled Afghanistan with no hopes of returning. We try to get them places to stay in Delhi at cheaper rates and help them in getting assistance from the Indian government. We also hope to get some news about our relatives from them,” explained Majeedy.Apart from worrying about family members, their own future worries the students. “I will complete my degree in a few months. I don’t know where I will go then. We cannot call Afghanistan our home till it’s under the rule of the Taliban,” said another Afghan student of LU.The students have intimated the university administration about their concerns. The University administration has assured the students of all possible help while they stay here.Caption:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/afghanistans-taliban-takeover-jitters-for-lu-s-afghan-students-as-fears-for-family-future-rise-101629221558853.html
17-08-2021||Gurugram||Three stormwater outlets on NH-48 to be turned into animal underpasses||The district wildlife department has decided to convert three stormwater outlets on the busy national highway 48 (NH-48) into animal underpasses, officials said on Tuesday. This is the first such initiative being undertaken in the district to provide safe passage to wild animals and reduce man-animal conflict. Officials said that work will start after the monsoon and will be completed within two months. “There are three water outlet points on this highway, which, once cleared, can be used as wildlife underpasses. This road is a busy highway, due to which it becomes difficult for animals to cross and move freely. At present, the areas are choked with silt, boulders and rocks; these will be cleared after the monsoon,” an official of the wildlife department, who did not wish to be named, said. The decision was taken two weeks ago, during a meeting with the principal chief conservator of forests for wildlife, following an inspection of the area. Two of the underpasses are near Panchgaon and one is near the National Security Guard outpost in Manesar. Officials said that two passages are of one metre (m) diameter, and one is a boxed passage with dimensions of 1.5mX1.5m. Talks to use these culverts as animal underpasses have been underway since late 2019. Last year, the wildlife department had also sent a proposal to the state forest department to start developing these underpasses. MS Malik, the chief conservator of forests for Gurugram circle, said, “We are working to clear the underpasses and have decided to set up fences on both sides of the road so that animals do not go on the highway and use the underpass for movement. This will take some time as animals are used to crossing through the highway, but gradually, as the path will be blocked, they will find their way to the underpass.” Due to the fragmentation of wildlife habitat, several cases of leopard and other animal deaths have been reported from this stretch. In October 2019, a one-and-a-half-year-old female leopard was killed by a truck on NH-48 in Manesar. A May 2017 report by Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, titled ‘Mapping landuse/landcover patterns in Aravallis Haryana with reference to status of key wildlife species’, pointed out that the highways passing through the wildlife habitats have adversely impacted the fauna. An excerpt from the WII report read, “Highways passing through the wildlife habitats have adversely affected the fauna in these forests. Fast-moving vehicles kill these animals when they move across these road stretches.” Meanwhile, environmentalists who have been demanding safety measures for wildlife said they are wary of the decision. Vivek Kamboj, a city-based environmentalist, said that it is good that outlets will be converted into animal underpasses, but strict measures need to be adopted to ensure that animals do not go on to the roads. “If fences are to be installed, they should not be made of barbed wires as habitually, the animal will try to cross the fence and cross over through the road, during which it can get injured. Chain-linked fences should be installed as it takes time for their behaviour to change. Further, as these are water outlets, officials should check this area every monsoon to ensure that they do not get choked,” said Kamboj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/three-stormwater-outlets-on-nh-48-to-be-turned-into-animal-underpasses-101629221381739.html

The date for the survey is yet to be announced by the state but it can be expected to be held in the last week of August, officials said on Tuesday.“The plan is to conduct a survey for three days in 75 clusters. Since the sample size is 3,000, as fixed by the state health department, our teams will cover 25 clusters in a day across identified urban and rural areas. From each cluster, at least 40 samples will be collected,” Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer for Gurugram said, explaining the plan. According to Yadav, at least 45 samples will be collected from rural areas and 30 from urban areas.The areas shortlisted for the same are Jharsa, Islampur and Shivaji Nagar, among others, in urban pockets and Daulatabad, Wazirabad, Budhera and Manesar in rural pockets.“For every cluster, a team of three people will be assigned, which will include a medical officer, lab technician and Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM). Also, there will be 12 supervisors to handle 75 ground teams,” said Yadav. The age-wise population to be covered under the survey will be revealed during a training session for health workers that is likely to be conducted at the end of the week by the state team.In the serological survey, blood samples are collected to check the prevalence of antibodies developed against Covid-19 infection. In the last two serological surveys held in 2020, the samples were tested in Gurugram and the results were shared with the state health team. However, Yadav said that this time, the samples will be sent directly to the state in all likelihood.Across the state, the survey will be done among 36,520 participants. According to Yadav, it will be done next week and will be spread across two to three days. The highest number of samples will be collected from Gurugram, while only 800 samples will be taken from Palwal, which has the lowest case count in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-health-dept-to-collect-samples-from-75-clusters-for-third-sero-survey-101629221380472.html
17-08-2021||Gurugram||Four venomous snakes rescued in 24 hours from residential areas||Four venomous snakes were rescued from different parts of the city in the past 24 hours and released in forests by officials of the wildlife department. Two three-and-a-half-foot common krait snakes were rescued from a house in Surat Nagar Phase-2 on Monday evening, while two spectacled cobras, each six feet long, were rescued on Monday night and Tuesday morning. Anil Gandas, a wildlife expert who led the rescue operations, said that of the four highly venomous snakes that were rescued, three were rescued from residences and one from an akhara (training facility) in Daulatabad. “On Monday evening, I received a call from Surat Nagar that there was a snake on the bed in a house. After reaching there, we found that two snakes were hiding near the mattress of the bed where the children sleep. Fortunately, the snakes were rescued before anyone got injured. Two more venomous snakes were rescued and no one was injured in those incidents as well,” said Gandas. He said that as common krait snakes live near areas with moisture and water, they were released near the Najafgarh drain, while the spectacled cobras were released in the Aravallis near Manesar. Snake sightings in Gurugram’s residential areas during monsoon season, particularly inside houses, have become commonplace over the past few years, according to the district wildlife department. This monsoon, over 60 snakes were rescued in Gurugram district in July, according to the wildlife department records. Around 20 species of snakes are native to the Aravallis and four of those, the monocled cobra, spectacled cobra, black cobra and the common krait, are highly venomous. These four snakes are afforded the highest level of protection by law under the Scheduled II species of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/four-venomous-snakes-rescued-in-24-hours-from-residential-areas-101629221379453.html
17-08-2021||Delhi||ED tells apex court Unitech assets worth ₹600cr attached||Money-laundering probe against the promoters of Unitech group, accused of diverting ₹5,000 crore of homebuyers’ money, has led to provisional attachment of their assets worth ₹600 crore, the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) informed the Supreme Court on Tuesday.In a status report submitted to the top court on their investigation carried out so far, the ED represented by additional solicitor general (ASG) Madhavi Divan said the report has been filed in a sealed cover and will require consideration by the court.The bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah agreed to take up the ED report on Wednesday and asked ASG Divan on the details of property attached so far. ASG Divan said, “Property worth ₹600 crore has been provisionally attached while an amount of ₹1,400 crore was found to have been diverted.”The report came at a time when the court is considering a resolution plan submitted by the new board of Unitech group which intends to construct and deliver close to 5,000 of the 15,000 flats in the next two years.A short note prepared by the new board said, “Construction of 15,000 units has to be done by the New Management for delivery of possession to homebuyers. At current prices, estimated cost of construction is ₹5,500-6,000 crores. If construction is not done, the refund claims of homebuyers are approximately ₹11,100 crores.”Seeking urgent order, the new board represented by additional solicitor general (ASG) N Venkataraman sought orders from the court to expedite payments due from homebuyers worth ₹3,354 crore. The bench said, “The whole success of this mission will depend on homebuyers contributing the money. But they will prefer plucking the low-lying fruits. If you first begin with projects which are substantially advanced in terms of construction, there will be greater willingness on part of homebuyers to pay the money.”Venkatraman informed the court that this factor has been considered by the board and the 15,000 flats have been categorized into three grades. The first grade includes projects which are self-sustaining and require the aid of money from homebuyers. Under this, 2,500 dwelling units are proposed to be handed over within a year and another 2,500 units within the second year. The projects under the second grade will require fund resources in addition to the deposit from homebuyers and the third phase will include those projects where only 20%-30% work is complete.The erstwhile Unitech promoters Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra deposited a sum of ₹377 crore with the Supreme Court registry. The new management also intends monetise unsold inventory (in the form of land parcels) in the name of Unitech group which could fetch roughly ₹5,641 crore. In addition, the sale of unsold flats across various Unitech housing projects is also expected to contribute a little over ₹3,500 crore, the note supplied by the board said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ed-tells-apex-court-unitech-assets-worth-600cr-attached-101629220746410.html
17-08-2021||Delhi||12 liquor zones’ auction from Aug 25, govt eyes ₹3,180 crore||The Delhi government has floated fresh tenders for auctioning licences for 12 liquor retail zones in the city, bidding for which will open on August 25 and close on September 2, according to documents HT has seen.The Delhi government has already earned ₹5,300 crore from auctioning alcohol licences for 20 of the city’s 32 zones on August 5 and 6, and looks set to double its excise revenue by netting a record ₹10,000 crore in the first few months of the new liberalised liquor policy.Auction of the 12 remaining zones could not take place because the bidders got disqualified in the last moment on technical grounds, forcing the government to issue fresh tenders.The annual reserve license fee for the zones range between ₹220 crore and ₹225 crore, according to the documents.The government estimates to earn ₹3,180 crore from the auction of licences in the 12 zones, and another ₹650 crore from excise duty, import fees, value added tax and other licence fees, the official added on condition of anonymity.Another ₹900 crore to ₹1,000 crore is expected to come from licensing of new brands, distributor licenses, etc, the official added.“The last auction was successful. In the upcoming auction too, the excise department estimates an average premium of 10% over reserve price of license set for each zone,” said a senior excise department official who asked not to be named.This will mark a new record for the Capital, and push annual earnings growth rate from the current 5-7% to over 30% -- highlighting that a new excise policy, which aims to reform the city’s liquor business by improving user experience, cleaning up the liquor mafia and eradicating pilferage, is making an impact within two months of being adopted.The average revenue of the city over the past three years stood at around ₹5,500 crore annually, according to government data. The new policy was implemented on June 11.The 12 zones to be put up for auction include localities such as Sarita Vihar, Shakarpur, Dakshinpuri, Anand Vihar, Tagore Garden, Vikaspuri, Trilokpuri-East, Badarpur, Timarpur, Nawada, Matiala, Rithala, Pitampura, Paschim Vihar, Lajpat Nagar, Jama Masjid, Paharganj, Najafgarh, Punjabi Bagh, Kasturba Nagar, Shastri Park, Mukherjee Nagar, Alipur, Narela, Ashok Vihar, IP Extension, Abul Fazl Enclave, Laxmi Nagar, Kalyanpuri, Sadar Bazar, Sriniwaspuri, Ballimaran, Deoli and Pratap Nagar.Under the new policy, retailers are free to decide the selling prices in a competitive environment, rather than an MRP being mandated by the government. Each zone will have at least 27 liquor vends — all of which will go to one successful bidder.When the first set of auction opened the reserve bidding price was set at ₹221 crore for each zone on an average but the licences were awarded at an average premium of 20% with the average bid price being ₹265 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/12-liquor-zones-auction-from-aug-25-govt-eyes-3-180-crore-101629220506206.html

In Pune district alone, soybean was sowed on 32,952 hectare as against the allocated 17,481 hectare. Not only Pune but across Maharashtra while soybean used to be earlier sowed on around 28 lakh hectare of land, it is now sowed on approximately 43 lakh hectare of land.Dnyaneshwar Bote, district agriculture officer, said, “The soybean rate is increasing every day. It gives a very good rate to farmers as compared to other Kharif crops. However, good rain too has helped increase sowing activity in the district.”“In major parts of the state, farmers have started focusing on the soybean crop. More farmers have left investing in groundnuts or jawari. Once a major crop in the Pune district, the sowing of jawari has gone down because it does not generate rates like soybean,” Bote said.Apart from soybean reaping more profit, soybean oil too is bringing in greater cash flow for traders.According to the state agriculture department, Kharif crops have been sowed on 11.03 hectare land across Maharashtra in 2021. With adequate rainfall, the sowing activity has entered its last stage. But wherever farming land was washed away due to heavy rain, re-sowing activity has been completed. Rice has been the worst-hit crop.“At many places, farmers suffered greater losses. Fertile soil was washed away due to heavy rain which caused major trouble in terms of re-sowing activity,” Bote said.In the Pune district alone, 97% of sowing activity has been completed with Kharif crops sowed on 184,274 hectare and sowing activity completed on 177,831 hectare.An official who did not wish to be named said, “In a majority of farms, crops have started growing and farmers are focusing on spraying fertilisers and keeping insects and pests away.”Vilas Uike, a farmer from Maval said, “We should not receive very heavy rain now.

It is an offline process that it will begin at railway stations from Wednesday, said officials. The move came on Tuesday when Pune District Collector Rajesh Deshmukh issued formal order allowing local trains for common citizens with double vaccination. Ravindra Binwade, additional municipal commissioner of the PMC, has issued an order and deputed two nodal officers – assistant municipal commissioner of the Dhole Patil road ward office, Dyndev Supe, at the Pune station; and assistant municipal commissioner of the Shivajinagar-Ghole road ward office, Rajendra Rengade, at the Shivajinagar station – as well as 16 primary teachers at the help desks for verification and issuing of passes to railway commuters. The help desks will be operational on all seven days of the week in two shifts namely, 7am to 1pm and 1pm to 7pm.The PMC on Tuesday rolled out standard operating procedures (SOPs) on how the offline system will operate.As per the SOPs, fully vaccinated commuters who have completed 14 days after the second dose and wish to avail a monthly pass can approach the help desks and show their vaccination certificates along with a government-issued photo id (preferably Aadhaar card). They also need to carry a photocopy of their photo id for stamping purposes. The staffers at the help desks will verify the authenticity of the vaccination certificates by scanning their QR codes and accordingly stamp “universal travel pass” on the certificates and photocopies of the photo id’s. Commuters can then use the same to procure monthly passes at the ticket counters. Commuters are required to carry all three – their ticket, vaccination certificate and id card – while travelling.Sunil Indulkar, deputy municipal commissioner, said, “As per state government SOPs, we will verify and approve vaccination certificates and photo id’s of commuters. We have spoken to the railway administration about the space for desks and other necessary facilities. We are providing training to primary teachers.”Rajendra Rengade, assistant muncipal commissioner of the Shivajinagar-Ghole road ward office said, “We are providing training to the staff on how to issue certificates to railway commuters as per the state government order. The offline system will be operational Wednesday onwards.”Indulkar said, “The PMC has also deployed two nodal officers at the two railway stations. Although passengers will get certificates online, they will have to take approval from PMC officials. Without the PMC stamp of approval, the railway administration will not issue tickets or monthly passes.”Manoj Jhawar, public relations’ officer (PRO), central railway - Pune division, said, “We will provide all the necessary facilities to the PMC staff help desk for issuing certificates of approval to railway commuters. We will also provide them with security to control crowding for passes. We will not allow passengers to travel in local trains without PMC certification.”Presently, the central railway’s Pune division is operating eight up and down local trains from Pune to Lonavala with around 4,000 commuters travelling daily, at least 50% of which are monthly pass holders.Jhawar said, “At present, there are eight up and down local trains from Pune to Lonavala and all these trains are operating for emergency services. In normal circumstances, there are 42 up and down local trains from Pune to Lonavala and around 70,000 to 80,000 commuters travelling daily on this route.”Earlier, the chief minister had announced that eligible citizens who have taken both doses against Covid-19 and completed 14 days after the second dose will be able to travel by local trains from August 15. Travel will be facilitated both online and offline however the process of creating a mobile application (app) and starting the online process may take a little more time which is why the offline process will begin from Wednesday, PMC officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-begins-offline-process-to-facilitate-local-train-travel-101629217837004.html

As per the chargesheet, considering all immovable property, LIC policies, and bank balances, the value is around ₹904 crore. Those properties have already been attached. These are all old values which are very low. To get the current value, a forensic audit report is required, and no such audit has taken place and therefore, there is no report.

The husband is being treated at a government hospital in Bikaner, officials said. According to sub-inspector Manak Lal of Churu’s Sardar Sahar police station, Mahendra Dan (32), who is being treated at PBM hospital, Bikaner, said in his complaint that his wife tried to kill him on August 12. According to Lal, Dan said that at around 9 pm when he returned from work, his wife came with food. After eating, he lost consciousness and woke up late at night due to electric shocks. His wife covered her hands with polythene bags and tied electricity wires to his legs to give him shocks. Due to shocks, Dan went unconscious again. On gaining consciousness the next day, he said his father and brother informed that his wife had called them late at night at around 2 am and told them that he got an electric shock. His legs were burnt and he was tied to the bed, he told police. In the preliminary investigation, the wife told police that his husband is an alcoholic and used to beat her. She said her brother recently visited them and her husband got into a heated argument with her brother after both consumed some alcohol. She said she was miffed with the daily torture and thus planned on giving electric shocks to the husband. The police said no arrest has been made in the case and probe is on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-woman-drugs-abusive-husband-to-give-electric-shocks-101629210516051.html

17-08-2021||Lucknow||‘Better turnout of students expected in coming days’||School managements in the state capital are all hopeful that in days to come the attendance rate of students will gradually go up. A day after the schools opened their gates for the students of Class XI to XII, as per the state government mandates, the schools reported a limited improvement in the numbers. On Monday, the schools opened with thin attendance but with a lot of enthusiasm. Mala Mehra, secretary, Unaided Private Schools Association says, “Slowly and gradually student attendance will surely increase.” Mehra also happens to be principal of Hoerner College. Many students have not given the permission letter that was made mandatory by school to rejoin offline classes. Anil Agarwal, president of Unaided Private School Association adds, “About 62% students turned up in schools and hopefully the number will go up in times to come.” Students are the happiest lot. Nav Sri Saxena, student of Class X, Delhi Public School, had to go for a haircut before resuming offline classes but he has no qualms as he is happy to back with his peer group. “I am more comfortable attending offline classes. More than that, I am very happy to meet my friends face-to-face after so many months. Now, I hope we get to hit the ground and get to play my favourite game — football,” he says. The educationists too are equally excited having students back on campus. “With children attending school our premises has become lively once again. There was excitement around- amongst students and teachers. Students did not mind the no recess policy as at least they got to meet their friends,” says Abha Anant, principal City Montessori School, Gomti Nagar. The government has asked schools to strictly adhere to Covid-19 protocol in allowing students into the classrooms. The government has also directed secondary schools to operate two sessions a day with a cap of 50 per cent students in each half. While the first session will be held between 8am and 12noon, the second session will start at 12.30 and conclude at 4.30pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/better-turnout-of-students-expected-in-coming-days-101629207155472.html

The latest Covid eases allows shops, malls and restaurants to operate till 10pm and private offices can operate 24X7 with staggered shift hours. Employees at shops, establishments and offices, however, will have to be fully vaccinated. “Restaurants and eateries have increased staff strength and expanded their list of orders. No price rise is expected. The brighter side of the relaxations is no wastage of vegetables and fruits,” said Vilas Bhujbal, head of traders and commission agents at Market Yard wholesale market. “As an essential service our shops were open during lockdowns as well, however, bulk intake of grains or vegetables which gives more profit was not happening as eateries were closed. Inquiries and placing of orders have now increased by 10%,” said Vishal Piprani, grain wholesaler from Market Yard. “It will take 15 days to see the business impact of new relaxations,” said Kapil Rege, vegetable retailer from Singhad road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/with-patrons-back-at-pune-restaurants-sale-of-veggies-goes-up-101629203614093.html
17-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt allots land for NDRF permanent station at Mahad||To ensure a speedier response during calamities such as floods in coastal areas of the state, the Maharashtra government has allocated a five-acre land parcel to set up a permanent base camp of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) at Mahad in Raigad district. This will help tackle disasters and emergencies like floods and cyclones that have been recurring on the Konkan coastline, causing loss of life and property. The rescuers are also trained to handle calamities like building and bridge collapses and chemical disasters.At present, in case of any disasters in Konkan, rescuers have to be dispatched from the NDRF facility at Talegaon near Pune, or from the Thane Disaster Response Force (TDRF) which falls under the purview of the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC). The distance between these facilities and the site of the tragedy leads to an increase in the response time. After the devastation caused by the recent floods in Konkan, the state government is working on a brownfield expansion of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) by stationing these teams in State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) camps.“We have allocated a two-hectare (five-acre) land parcel at Mahad for a permanent base camp of NDRF or SDRF. Currently, in case of a calamity, rescue teams have to come from either Pune or Thane which takes around 10 to 12 hours to reach the spot. This camp will ensure that these personnel will be able to respond to the crisis in the golden hour,’” said Aditi Tatkare, minister of state for industries and guardian minister of Raigad district. The land, which belonged to the dairy development department, was handed over for the purpose last week.“Developing a NDRF or SDRF permanent base camp there will cut down the response time by around five to six hours. The location of this facility in Mahad will ensure that rescuers can reach many places in Raigad in around two hours,” she said.Tatkare added that they had approached the Union government in November last year for a permanent base camp of NDRF in Raigad. However, if necessary, the state was also ready to station SDRF there for rescue operations. The camp will also function as a training centre for locals, who are usually the first responders in case of any calamities like the collapse of Tariq Gardens building in Mahad last year. These local volunteers will be trained once every six months.The camp will also cover the northern part of Ratnagiri in talukas like Khed and Chiplun. The industrial belt in Mahad, Roha and Chiplun has a number of chemical industries, and NDRF or SDRF units stationed at Mahad can tackle any unforeseen emergencies in these areas.Tatkare said they had also sent a proposal to the Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) to start hospitals on Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) lands at Taloja, Roha and Pen in Raigad.BOX:NDRF has a battalion consisting around 1,149 people stationed at Sudumbare at Talegaon near Pune to cover Maharashtra and Goa.It has stationed three teams consisting of 45 men each, including engineers, technicians, and medical staff, and two sniffer dogs at Andheri sports complex in Mumbai.Modelled on the lines of NDRF, which is a specialised force to respond to natural and man-made disasters, SDRF has two companies at Nagpur and Dhule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-allots-land-for-ndrf-permanent-station-at-mahad-101629203074020.html

The survey started from Garade village in Purandar tehsil. The Pune ring road is a proposed circular outer road for the Pune metropolitan region. The land measurement of western part of the road is 95% complete with only three villages in Maval tehsil remaining to be surveyed, according to MSRDC officials. The eastern part of the ring road will pass through 46 villages and officials plan to complete the land measurement procedure in three months. “We have started the land measurement procedure for eastern part of the ring road from Garade village and are meeting locals to finish the survey within three months,” said Sandeep Patil, sub-divisional engineer, MSRDC. Officials had faced resistance from villagers during the land measurement process for the western part of the project. “In the eastern part, there is resistance mostly from villages near Rajgurunagar in Khed tehsil. We are holding meetings with villagers to seek their cooperation,” said Pati. MSRDC received a formal nod for land acquisition process of the eastern side of the ring road on May 19 this year. The eastern ring road will pass through 46 villages in five tehsils, namely Maval, Khed, Purandar, Bhor and Haveli in Pune district. The western side of the road covers 38 villages and land survey of three villages is remaining. “The three villages are Kelwade, Chandkhed and Bebdohol and it will be completed by the end of this month,” said Patil. The state government had approved land acquisition for the 173.70-km ring road project to be implemented by MSRDC. The project would require acquisition of almost 1,600 hectares of land with estimated cost of road being ₹26,000 crore and ₹5,000 crore for land acquisition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/msrdc-begins-land-survey-for-eastern-part-of-pune-ring-road-aims-to-complete-it-in-3-months-101629202293972.html
17-08-2021||Patna||Bihar’s organ and tissue transplant body alleges state govt’s neglect towards its functioning||Bihar’s State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (SOTTO), responsible for coordination in procurement and distribution of organs and tissues and their registry at state level, says it has become a victim of government neglect. Established in 2016 by the directorate general of health services (DGHS) and ministry of health and family welfare (MoH&FW), Bihar’s SOTTO has not received the Centre’s nod this year for revalidation of funds. As a result, it is unable to spend funds despite having around ₹34 lakh remaining in its kitty, HT has learnt. Experts at SOTTO say this has hampered the organisation’s activities. “We have raised the issue with the health ministry on delay in revalidation of funds for SOTTO. The ministry convened two meetings, one in July when it said the issue will be resolved in 15-20 days. Another meeting was held last week wherein we have been communicated that we will get the nod for utilisation of unspent funds in 10 days,” said SOTTO-Bihar chairman Dr Manish Mandal, who is also the medical superintendent of the IGIMS.So far, the SOTTO has collected only 250 pledges for organ donation in Bihar. This speaks volumes of its information education and counselling activities. Its registry of organ donation and transplant is primarily confined to the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) in Patna, where its office is located. Barring the IGIMS, an autonomous institute under the state government, and the Paras-HMRI hospital in the private sector, the three other facilities in Bihar, registered for organ transplant under SOTTO do not share their data regularly. The organisation’s efforts to prod the state health department into persuading the facilities eligible for transplant to enrol under SOTTO and share their data on transplants have also gone in vain. According to SOTTO officials, they have not been paid for the last four months. The joint director’s post, which is among the four positions sanctioned, is vacant after the previous incumbent resigned on March 31, 2020, allegedly due to unattractive remuneration. Against this backdrop, the SOTTO, together with its national and regional units — the NOTTO and the ROTTO — is expected to contribute to generating 75,000 pledges for organ donation across the country this year. The Centre had initially released ₹116 lakh under its National Organ and Transplant Programme for SOTTO Bihar in 2019. The funds reached in December and the SOTTO could spend only a fraction, about ₹3 lakh as staff salary, before the funds lapsed on March 31, 2020. The SOTTO spent another ₹79 lakh against infrastructure development and salary after revalidation of funds for 2020-21. Almost five months into the next fiscal, it now awaits the Centre’s nod for funds. Efforts to reach Dr Anil Kumar, additional deputy director-general, DGHS, proved futile, as he did not respond to calls and text messages on his cellphone. Hindustan Times also sent him an e-mail on Tuesday and was awaiting his response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihars-organ-and-tissue-transplant-body-alleges-state-govt-s-neglect-towards-its-functioning-101629201756185.html

Prakash said police constable Premlata of state police’s Nirbhaya Squad (an all women unit) was especially deployed at the spot to keep an eye on anti-social elements. “Over 200 objectionable video clips were found in his phone and it was found that many of these were shot in tourist spots, temples, World Trade Park, etc. The accused confessed that he often used to travel to Jaipur to record such videos,” the police officer said. The accused told police that he was making such videos for the last two and a half months ever since his Mount Abu visit, where he was influenced by a group engaged in filming obscene videos. Police said they are now trying to identify and nab the people he met in Mount Abu. A case has been registered under Section 354 and 509 of the Indian Penal Code, and Section 66 of the IT Act.

17-08-2021||Chandigarh||Old soldiers ride into the sunset like a ‘sheh sawar’||“Girtey hain sheh sawar hi maidaney jung mein, woh tifl kya girey, jo ghutno ke bal chaley (It’s only the brave horseman who can fall in the battlefield, not the child who crawls).” That was the opening line of our equitation officer, Major Prithi Singh, as he addressed the morning parade of the cadets at the National Defence Academy (NDA). That was a pretty apt proverb to use, because every day several cadets bit the dust as they were thrown off their steeds. This is pretty true in most walks of life. If you don’t venture, then you will neither fail nor succeed. However, it is most applicable to the military way of life where you must not falter when the day of reckoning arrives. Over the three years of training in the NDA and one year after that in the respective training institutions of the three services, this aspect is inculcated in the young minds of the cadets by various means. You read about the mighty brave men by reading military history. You also get to meet some of the war-decorated officers who are posted in these training institutions. All this has a positive effect on the young cadets. The real deal starts after you are commissioned as officers in your respective service. It is a highly competitive profession. An officer has to attend a number of training courses and it is essential that you get a good grading to add some shine to your profile. Promotion to the rank of colonel and above, are based on a selection process. In a pyramid rank structure, just about 10% of a batch goes up to the rank of major general. Compare this with the IAS/ IPS, where almost everyone makes it to the rank of joint secretary or inspector general, which is equivalent to a major general. This may sound grim but actually it is not. Life in the armed forces is one full of excitement as you move across the country every three years. Opportunity for adventure is immense. You can be a flyer, paratrooper, commando, mountaineer, diver and even an astronaut! Name the sport and the facility is available. Even in a place like Leh, you will find a golf course of sorts. It’s the best environment to nourish your progeny and give them a well-rounded personality. As and when one gets passed over for promotion, one is mentally trained to accept it and move on. A few call it quits to start a successful second career in the civvy street, but a majority stick it out till retirement. The important point is that you must remain a ‘sheh sawar’ through the thick and thin of life. The best that a soldier gets from all this is the great feeling of comradeship. Fauji friendships are lifelong even if you don’t meet each other. There can never be this kind of a relationship in the civil services because their structure is very different. Finally, the day comes when we have to say a farewell to arms. For most, it is a sad moment but there is also the feeling of a life well lived. You become a member of multiple WhatsApp groups of the forces and share your thoughts as also banter around a bit. There are course and regimental get-togethers on a regular basis. But like for everyone, life has to end one day. They say old soldiers never die, they just fade away. I would like it to be different. I would like the old soldier to ride into the sunset like a ‘sheh sawar’. Sit firmly in the saddle, chest out, shoulders back, head high, chin in, knees into the flanks, toes up, heels down, elbows tucked in, and hands together held low over the front arch of the saddle. Now give aid to your steed and walk slowly into the sunset. I think that in the heavens above, Major Prithi Singh would be pleased to see one of his ‘sheh sawars’ ride into the sunset. bullysangha@gmail.com The writer is a Gurugram-based Vir Chakra awardee||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/old-soldiers-ride-into-the-sunset-like-a-sheh-sawar-101629198274027.html

The official said that all the four accused would be charge-sheeted by the end of August."No sign of a short circuit in the water cooler. All the four accused will be charge-sheeted by the end of this month," ANI said quoting the person familiar with the police investigation.The four accused—Kuldeep Singh, Laxmi Narayan, Radhey Shyam and Salim Ahmad — all of whom worked at the crematorium in Purani Nangal village, near Delhi Cantonment, told the parents the nine-year-old that she died of electrocution when she was fetching water from an electric water cooler installed on the premises on August 1. The four also forcibly cremated the child and allegedly threatened her parents from going to the police.The four men were arrested after the victim’s parents alleged rape before she was killed. Police booked the four on charges of murder, rape and criminal intimidation, in a case registered under the Indian Penal Code’s sections 302, 376 and 506, in addition to relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and the SC/ST Act.The mother of the victim had asked her to fetch water from the cooler on the premises of the crematorium, as she often did. The victim’s family, who belong to the impoverished Valmiki community, were acquainted with the accused and they did not suspect any trouble.When the victim didn’t return home for about half-an-hour, her mother went to the crematorium where one of the accused, Radhe Shyam, told her that her daughter died of electrocution from touching the water cooler. “I saw my daughter lying still on a bench. Her hands and feet were stretched out. Her eyes were closed, her lips were blackish, her nose was bleeding and water was oozing out of her mouth.

He has made some objectionable comments against the Prime Minister and recently in the context of Covid-19.”Mishra has been booked under five sections of the Indian Penal Code, including 505 (public mischief), and the Epidemic Diseases Act, according to the First Information Report (FIR) filed in the case. HT has seen a copy of the FIR.“The police came (last week) saying they needed to ask him some questions at the station and that they would send him back in two hours.

Around 250-feet of the bund has been washed away in strong currents of the river Ganga.The river, which has been at its highest level at Hathidah in Mokama of Patna district for the past one week, crossed the highest flood level of 34.72m, registered in 2016, at Bhagalpur and was flowing 3cm above the HFL at 3pm on Monday and was on a rising trend. Ganga waters were at a new HFL of 43.54m at Hathidah.In Patna, the river was flowing at 50.34m against the highest flood level of 50.52m registered in 2016 at Gandhi Ghat and 51.68m at Digha against the 1975 HFL of 52.52m. Other tributaries of Ganga like Sone, Gandak, Kosi, Bagmati, Ghaghra and Burhi Gandak were also reported to be flowing above the danger levels at different stretches of their course.Meanwhile, four persons, including a woman and three children, drowned and two others went missing after a boat carrying them capsized in river Gandak near Kuchaikot of Gopalganj.Enraged by absence of relief, hundreds of villagers, who have been sheltered on an embankment in Khagaria following the flooding from Kosi, blocked vehicular traffic on the nearby national highway 31 for many hours and shouted slogans against the district authorities.

Bihar incurred a loss of nearly ₹500 crore, besides heavy casualties, due to floods in 2019. The Central government has already identified as many as 14 districts vulnerable to extreme weather conditions.Also Read | Woman in Bihar’s Gopalganj brings mushroom cultivation homeChief conservator of forests (CCF) and nodal officer of climate change AK Dwivedi said that the department would start drafting a comprehensive action plan to fight the climate crisis once the United National Environment Programme (UNEP), a voluntary organisation, submitted an action plan to reduce carbon emissions by 2040. The Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) signed an agreement with UNEP to frame a strategy to develop a low carbon emission pathway in February this year.Dwivedi said that the UNEP is supposed to study the impact of the climate crisis on sectors such as education, floods, health, ground water, etc. “Besides, the department will also survey various sectors on its own so that a comprehensive action plan can be prepared this time,” he added.The water resources department (WRD), which is currently grappling with minimising the devastation due to floods, is also working on plans to interlink rivers so that excessive water from swollen rivers can be diverted to less flooded rivers. Around 20 districts out of 38 are facing floods right now. The department has already undertaken an intensive plantation drive and revival of water bodies so that the groundwater depletion can be checked effectively.Officials of the environment and climate change department said that the state will receive monetary help from the Central government to work on mitigation strategies if its action plan is approved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-govt-to-work-on-action-plan-to-deal-with-climate-crisis-101629187292657.html

India Meteorological Department (IMD), Rajasthan, director Radhey Shyam Sharma said the amount of rainfall will increase around August 20 in eastern Rajasthan, and western Rajasthan will continue to witness light rain. “There was less rainfall this monsoon due to the 20-day break monsoon conditions in June. The monsoon has taken a break again,” he said. Sharma said the uneven distribution of rains is a usual phenomenon and happens every year. “Rainfall in some districts in western Rajasthan is likely to remain below normal because no significant rainfall is expected there now,” he said. Also Read | 4 killed in road accident in Hanumangarh district of RajasthanHowever, the amount of rainfall could increase after a couple of days with the possibility of light to moderate rain in the eastern parts of the state with the possibility of heavy rain at isolated areas, he said. He did not rule out another flood-like situation in eastern Rajasthan, where another round of good rainfall is expected. Kisan mahapanchayat president Rampal Jat expressed concern over the weak monsoon, especially in western Rajasthan. He said districts such as Banswara and Dungarpur generally receive excessive rain, but this time the less rainfall is a surprise.“The crops are totally dependent on good monsoon. Already, the Kharif crops (jwar, corn, maize, millet, soybean, pulses) were weak as sowing was affected by the delay in the onset of monsoon. Now, Rabi crops (wheat, gram and millet), which, too, are dependent on rains will get adversely impacted,” he said.The total land under agriculture in Rajasthan is around 18.2 million hectares. The government had set the sowing target of 16.38 million hectares, of which 13.86 million hectares (85%) is achieved. Around 7.5 million hectares of land is part of western Rajasthan, where some districts have received deficient rainfall.Jat said only 20% of the agricultural land in the state is irrigated by canals, the remaining land is dependent on groundwater for irrigation, the level of which is low because of the lack of rain.According to the state water resources department, of the 727 dams in Rajasthan, 118 are completely filled, 308 are partially filled and 279 are empty. The department also said that 11 of the 33 districts in the state faced a deficit in rainfall, 14 saw normal rainfall and four districts received excessive rain from June 1 to August 16. Four districts recorded abnormal rain in the same period. Kota division, which saw floods, recorded abnormal rains with 71.7% more rain than the average for past 10 years. The Bharatpur division recorded excess rain while the Jodhpur division is under the deficit rainfall category. Bikaner, Ajmer and Jaipur are under the normal category. Districts with deficit rain (-20% to -59%) are Banswara, Barmer, Bhilwara, Dungarpur, Ganganagar, Jalore, Jodhpur, Pali, Rajsamand, Sirohi and Udaipur; while Ajmer, Alwar, Bharatpur, Bikaner, Chittorgarh, Churu, Dholpur, Hanumangarh, Jaipur, Jhunjhunu, Nagaur, Pratapgarh and Sikar recorded normal rain (19% to -19%). Districts such as Jaisalmer, Jhalawar, Karauli and Tonk are under the excess rainfall (20% to 59%) category whereas Baran, Bundi, Kota and Sawai Madhopur recorded abnormal rain (60% or more). A senior official of the agriculture department said the assessment of Rabi crops could be made once the rain resumes, till now the monsoon was useful for the Kharif crops. “The sowing for Kharif crops was affected because of poor monsoon in Jodhpur, Bikaner, and Jalore divisions,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/excessive-rain-in-eastern-rajasthan-deficit-in-western-101629186452767.html

On Tuesday, all three accused were sent to 14-days in judicial custody. Police recovered a knife used in the crime, the deceased jawan’s shoes and two mobile phones from Mohammad Fahim alias Raza, a resident of Siliguri in West Bengal, Amit Kumar Yadav and Chhotu Pandey alias Vikash Upadhyay, residents of Rasoolpur in Saran district. Police said Chhotu Pandey owned a local music band named Royal Orchestra and Raza was a bouncer working for him. The third, Amit, was their friend and an active member of Yaduvansi Sena (a political group of Yadav community). 38 year old Arjun Dayal alias Arjun Thapa, a native of Chitwan in Nepal, was found murdered near Gopalganj’s famous Thawe temple, where he was deployed. He served in the elite Gorkha Vahini’s 1st battalion of the erstwhile Bihar Military Police (BMP), now known as BSAP. This battalion is deployed only on special duty like security of the CM, governor and chief justice and anti-Maoist operations. A company of the battalion has been deployed in Gopalganj since March this year. A special investigation team (SIT) constituted led by deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Naresh Paswan first caught Raza, who told police that he had stabbed Dayal with a knife and also revealed names of two of his associates involved in the crime.Gopalganj police chief Annad Kumar told HT that Raza has a criminal record in West Bengal and he killed Dayal due to personal enmity over a money dispute. Raza got into an argument with Dayal, who had come to listen to the orchestra after finishing his duty, at around midnight on August 11 and stabbed him to death with help from his associates.

17-08-2021||Patna||Separate cadre for school heads in Bihar through competition to improve quality||Bihar government will create separate cadres for head teachers in primary schools and headmasters in higher secondary schools who will have to qualify through a competitive examination, possibly resulting in an improvement in the quality of education in schools, chief minister Nitish Kumar said in his Independence Day speech in Patna on Sunday.Implementing the new process will require amending the regulations for school teachers that were announced just ahead of the assembly elections last year and provided for appointment of headmasters and head teachers through promotion of teachers fulfilling the required qualifications.Principal secretary of the department of education Sanjay Kumar said it was a major policy decision.“The guidelines for the appointment of headmasters will be framed first and later we will change the regulations announced last year. Last year’s regulations were for teachers appointed through panchayati raj institutions since 2006, while the cadre of headmasters and head teachers will now be of the state level. All teachers could participate in the competition, subject to qualification. The details will be published soon,” he added.At present, a large number of schools are without headmasters and the matter has been raised in the Bihar legislature time and again.The principal secretary said that the cadre of headmasters for secondary schools will be at the divisional level, while that for head teachers for primary schools will be at the district level. “For high schools, those with requisite qualification could participate in the competition even from outside the government school system. Those working with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) or Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CICSE) schools could also participate. The basic objective is to bring in quality people for quality leadership in schools so that the system improves,” he added.The move is in keeping with the Union ministry of Human Resource development’s suggestion last year to the states to consider filling 50% posts of headmasters in primary and upper primary schools through direct recruitment.The lack of quality education in government schools has often caused a lot of embarrassment despite growing enrolment, incentives and expenditure and even drawn flak from the Patna High Court.With the new move, the government, said a senior official, will provide a platform to meritorious teachers to excel and join the government cadre. The school teachers appointed in the last 15 years have been demanding old prescribed pay-scale and they also fought a long legal battle with the government, but lost.“Now, the government wants to give opportunity to the deserving ones through an open competition, which would require them to compete with the best, even from outside the government system. The modalities are being worked out and it could soon be placed before the cabinet,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/separate-cadre-for-school-heads-in-bihar-through-competition-to-improve-quality-101629179492066.html
17-08-2021||Kolkata||Forced to live in isolation, white-bellied heron inches closer to extinction||Loss of habitat is forcing the white-bellied heron to lead an isolated lifestyle deep inside forests, which in turn is pushing this critically endangered bird more towards extinction, scientists have found in a new study. It is estimated that less than 10 of these water birds are presently living in Arunachal Pradesh, which is its only habitat in India, while around there could be 70 – 400 in the world. The population is critically endangered, meaning that it is just one step away from going extinct. “Due to loss of habitat, primarily wetlands, this bird seems to have changed its lifestyle over years. Unlike most other water birds, which are usually group foragers, the white-bellied heron has been living in remote jungles without much interaction with other water birds. This is pushing it further towards extinction. It is like a viscous trap,” said G Maheshwaran, a scientist from the Zoological Survey of India who led the study. Also Read | Rare orchid species found in India for the first timeThe isolation prevented these birds from gaining experience from fellow foragers about new sites and food sources which could have enhanced their survival. “Earlier studies have shown that water birds, which are mostly colonial foragers, enhance their survival skills by sharing experiences and information about food and suitable habitats. But as these herons lost their original habitats and got isolated inside undisturbed forests inside the Namdhapa Tiger Reserve, they depended on fishes found in fast flowing streams and rivers, which hardly support any water bird community. With no interaction with other foraging birds, they failed to gather experience about new habitats and food sources and are now facing extinction threat,” said Himadri Sekhar Mondol, an expert with the Bombay Natural History Society, who was also a part of the study team. The scientists said that this is the first such study on the white–bellied heron to find out the reasons behind its depleting population. The findings have been published in the peer-reviewed journal Ecological Informatics published by Elsevier. Scientists of the ZSI in Kolkata and BNHS unless efforts are made to conserve the population in northeast India, the birds may move to Myanmar and Bhutan. “There is a need to enhance protection measures in the existing protected areas where the birds are found. More extensive Environment Impact Assessments should be undertaken before large scale developmental activities, including constructing a dam, are given permission in the area. Models have projected that the birds may also prefer riverine habitats along the Kamlang and Lohit rivers. If human activities like mining, garbage dumping and dams impact these ecosystems then it may threaten long term viability of the species,” said Lalit Sharma, a wildlife ecologist with the ZSI specialising in geospatial modelling. Experts said that just like the great Indian bustard has a species recovery plan prepared by the centre for its conservation, such plans should also be made for the white-bellied heron. “It is very shy and critically endangered. We do not have a proper survey for these birds in the river basin where they are found in Arunachal Pradesh and there are no detailed studies as they are rarely spotted. If proper conservation measures are not adopted, they might go extinct. We have such long-term dedicated monitoring programs such as the GIB. Ecologically and evolutionarily, they have adapted to such ecosystems along fast flowing rivers in deep forests. If the river’s flow is disrupted it may take an effect of the toll on the bird’s population,” said GV Gopi, a senior scientist at WII working on water birds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/forced-to-live-in-isolation-white-bellied-heron-inches-closer-to-extinction-101629172651159.html

Fifty-year-old Rekha Kumari cultivates three variants of mushroom in her farmhouse, and trains other women as well.“We have information that Rekha Kumari has trained more than 500 people, mainly women. Inspired by her, at least 50 people have engaged in mushroom cultivation,” said Ved Narayan Singh, district agriculture officer (DAO), Gopalganj. A resident of Hathuwa in Gopalganj district, Kumari started with just ₹1,000 in 2013 and cultivates Button, Oyster and Milky mushrooms in six rooms (about 1,500 square feet), learning nuances from Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University Pusa at Samastipur. Today, she says she earns between ₹3-4 lakh. “There was a slump in the earning during the first two phases of the pandemic but it has not slipped below the five figure yet,” said Kumari from Samastipur where she is undergoing further training for seed generation. She is also focusing on Hericium, Shiitake and Paddy Straw, three other species of mushroom, besides producing seed. “The cultivation mushroom requires a lot of adjustment, judgement, calculation and monitoring of a moisture level, cross-ventilation, and screening the produce from light for good result. It is all about discipline and it does not involve strenuous work,” Kumari said, a graduate in economics from JP university, Chhapra.Over the year, Kumari has learnt to make samosa, pickles, biscuits, namkeen , Gulab Jamun and laddoo with mushrooms to stretch the shelf life of her produce and has employed six women as well.A mother of two daughters and a son, Kumari’s husband Avinash Prasad encouraged her to engage in mushroom cultivation after their children were grown up. Meanwhile, many women have trained under Kumari. Md. Neyaz Ahmad, assistant director, horticulture, Gopalganj said, “We are encouraging her to register her firm and impart formal training.”Chanda Devi, a resident of Haziyapur, who has trained with Kumari, said, “After picking up the basic tips, we have started cultivation in January this year.” Officials put the total number of farmers engaged in mushroom cultivation between 80 and 90 in Gopalganj district alone. “The total production of Oyster mushroom alone is around 320 quintal per annum,” said Md. Neyaz Ahmad, assistant director horticulture. Gopalganj district magistrate Dr Naval Kishor Choudhary said, “In our bid to promote such cultivation by farmers, we are doing everything to ensure assistance to Rekha Kumari, which includes a tie-up with bank and linkage with NABARD. These apart, we are assisting her to develop a project to facilitate her production on commercial scale,” said the district magistrate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/woman-in-bihar-s-gopalganj-brings-mushroom-cultivation-home-101629171150975.html

17-08-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A vanished Afghanistan||You are so wrong if you believe that Delhi’s Sunday book bazaar is dispensable. That place is like a gigantic public library whose used books are oftentimes precious souvenirs of our vanished worlds. Recently, a paperback of Lonely Planet Afghanistan was unearthed from the bazaar. It was a rare copy, the first and the only edition published by the guidebook series. Days later, Afghanistan entered into a new history with the dramatic comeback of the Taliban. Here’s a review of the outdated but historically significant book, as a homage to what Afghanistan could have been (complete with its Lonely Planet-carrying tourists), and also as a pean to Delhi’s irreplaceable book bazaar.Afghanistan for touristsHere’s your chance to finally drive through Afghanistan’s highways, stroll through its cities, enjoy afternoon naps in its mosques, kill time in its chaikhanas, pluck pomegranates from its orchards, and hopefully return home—alive. Just pick up Lonely Planet Afghanistan, published in 2007.Like a poetry anthology that spares you the nonessential prose, the guidebook goes straight to the land’s haunting beauty—the Ka Faroshi Bird Market of Kabul with its narrow lane lined with stalls selling birds, the minaret of Jam looming up high in the mountains, the 800-year-old tile-mosaic mosque of Herat, the orchards of Panjshir valley, the blue domes of Hazrat Ali’s shrine at Mazar-e-Sharif, and the dilapidated cafes of Kandahar decked with posters of Indian film stars. There are also snappy, succulent accounts of Afghanistan as experienced by authors like Christina Lamb and Tamim Ansary.A most poignant destination, other than the ruins of Bamiyan Buddhas, must be Kabul’s OMAR Landmine museum. Exhibiting more than 60 types of landmines that litter the Afghan countryside, the museum gives the tourist a direct understanding of the nation’s enduring tragedy and also explains the presence of very many amputees walking in its wounded cities.The travel naturally entails risk. The person helping you with directions could be a militant; the road barrier could be the work of bandits; the next step while hiking in the Nuristan mountains could trigger a landmine blast. Life is severely uncertain in Afghanistan.This book warns: “Only you are responsible for your safety, so it’s absolutely essential that before considering a visit you assess the security situation from reliable, up-to-date sources.”Perhaps you may want to use the guidebook only for armchair travelling.Until Afghanistan—a mere two hours flying time away from Delhi—becomes a more normal country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-vanished-afghanistan-101629164522939.html
17-08-2021||Delhi||Vax drive picks up pace in the Capital||mmunisation against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Delhi has picked up pace over the last 10 days, with over 100,000 shots being administered on all days except Sundays. In comparison, over 100,000 doses were administered only on six days during the first half of July, with officials blaming tapering supplies by the end of the month.Even as the number of shots administered dropped to 4,046 on Independence Day, a Sunday, on an average, over 97,000 doses have been administered each day in August so far. In comparison, over 68,800 doses were administered each day on an average during July.The number of people receiving the first dose of the vaccine has also increased from August 2, with the government gradually increasing the use of Covishield stock for the first stock.The number of second doses administered became higher than first doses since the third week of July.With 18-45-year-olds who were immunised in May when the vaccination drive opened for them becoming eligible for their second dose after the 84-day window between jabs, and vaccines in short supply, the government had to stop using Covishield for first dose-takers on July 22.“In the beginning of August, the government had directed that only 20% of the doses be used for first shot. This was increased to 40% the next week, and last week it was further increased up to 50% as the supplies stabilised. The districts, however, have the freedom to decide whether or not to use fewer vaccines for first dose, like we are utilising 40% at the moment,” said an official from south-west district.The official added, “There is huge demand for the first dose, whereas the demand for the second dose is low at the moment because fewer people received their first dose in May and have now completed the waiting gap of 84 days.”So far, 8.3 million of Delhi’s 20 million population have received at least one dose of the vaccine, and 3.3 million are fully vaccinated.Another official added that the number of vaccines administered in Delhi is likely to remain high for the month.“Although we come to know about the vaccine supply only around a week in advance, this month the supply has been stable and we are hoping that it will continue the same way. Last month, there were frequent shortages with the state rationing the number of doses given to the districts,” said an official from Shahadara district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/vax-drive-picks-up-pace-in-the-capital-101629164016622.html
17-08-2021||Delhi||Despite issues, city’s free Wi-Fi scheme is still a hit||Minutes after the clock struck ten, 11-year-old Anamika Mahato finished an online mathematics class with her school teacher on the mobile phone of her father, Akhilesh Mahato. She fiddled with the phone for a while, scrolling through few applications she said she downloaded on her own, played Candy Crush for a few minutes, and then handed over the phone to Akhilesh, as he finished his breakfast and left for his shop – a makeshift set-up in east Delhi’s Kondli neighbourhood where he sells hand bags.The next class would be history, scheduled at 11am. Anamika borrowed her mother’s phone, and quickly opened a WiFi log-in page. By now, she said, she has learnt her mother’s Aadhaar number by heart – a mandatory requirement for logging in to the page that enables usage of internet service under the Delhi government’s free Wi-Fi scheme, which was rolled out in December 2019. The Wi-Fi device is installed right outside the Mahato’s one-room residence at a slum cluster in Patparganj.“Mobile internet packages are easily available these days. We get 1 GB free data every day with the prepaid mobile plan we subscribe to. But with schools switching to online classes because of Covid-19, the 1 GB data lasts for a maximum of two online classes. The days she (Anamika) has more than two classes, we have to use the government’s Wi-Fi facility,” said Mithila Mahato, Anamika’s mother.So far, the government has set up 10,561 Wi-Fi hotspots across the city – of which 2,208 are in bus stands that witness high foot fall, and the rest are located in markets and residential areas, including large numbers of slums and unauthorised colonies that are densely populated. The service was launched in December 2019, around the same time when the central government too cleared a proposal to set up public Wi-Fi access network interfaces throughout the country. The pan-India project is yet to materialise though. By March 2020, Delhi turned out to be the first city in India to have such wide public Wi-Fi network, said officials in the chief minister’s office.However, there are a large number of complaints regarding failure to connect to the hotspots despite being located close to it and poor speed even if one manages to connect.Mukesh Kumar, who owns a roadside eatery in south Delhi’s Khirki Extension locality, is not as lucky as Mahato in terms of equal access to the free internet service. Kumar’s 13-year-old son, Ankit, and nine-year-old daughter, Aarshi, are both students of a government school in Hauz Rani. The two have been attending online classes for around a year now but Mukesh’s attempts to connect to the Wi-Fi device near his home at a slum cluster in Shekh Sarai locality yielded no results.“I finally gave up and purchased three SIM cards. Now I get 1.5 GB free data in each which helps my children attend online classes. But that costs me more than ₹750 per month, which is difficult in such times when business is poor. The Wi-Fi often did not connect, and when it did, at times, the quality was so poor that the line got disconnected in the middle of the class,” said Kumar.A senior government official explained, “When the initiative was launched, people doubted if it would be of any use in the age of cheap mobile data. We were the first city to have such a system functional. Till then, there were public WiFi systems available in airports, railway stations, etc but not in slums, markets and residential areas. In the last two years, several cities have launched such projects, which include Bengaluru and Hyderabad. In Delhi, user traffic for the public Wi-Fi system has immensely increased during the Covid-19 pandemic. Most hotspots are more often operating in full capacity now. That is why many often fail to connect and even if they do, they face speed issues.”Each individual Aadhaar number registered under the initiative is entitled to 15 GB internet data per month. In a single day, they can use upto 1 GB. The system works through a network of hotspots. Each of them operates well in a 50m radius. The government has capped the maximum number of users at a point at 200 for each hotspot, said the official.“When too many people are registered at the same time, the speed drops to 1 Mbps. Web pages are too heavy these days and 1 Mbps services do not work at all. It is hardly any different from no connectivity at all,” said Aneesh Yadav, a 22-year-old frequent commuter on the 623 DTC bus route who tries connecting to the free Wi-Fi system at the ITO bus stand.HT reached out to several government officials but they did not share numbers of total complaints received since the launch of the service in December 2019.Despite its shortcomings in terms of accessibility, the system is helping several families, especially in the age of the pandemic.Vinod Jha, 45, was a factory worker who lost his left arm in an accident 12 years ago, and for a decade, his family’s primary sources of income are a makeshift shop he runs near the railway tracks in west Delhi’s Mayapuri, close to the industrial area where he once worked, and the salary of his wife who works as a domestic worker in neighbouring colonies. The family resides in the slum cluster along the railway track which has a Wi-Fi hotspot and their 15-year-old son, Sachin, who is a student in a government school, uses it for online classes.Over the last one week, HT interviewed several users of the service. Most of them have smartphones with data packs for internet service and they often use the government’s Wi-Fi over and above the service they pay for.Most of them said that their usage of the free Wi-Fi service has increased with the Covid-19 pandemic. What they do with the free internet service includes online classes of their children, surfing social media, reading news in vernacular languages, watching news capsules on YouTube, job searches, and connecting with their relatives in villages over WhatsApp calls.Deepak Kumar, a resident of the slum cluster close to the industrial area in West Delhi’s Naraina neighbourhood, said his mobile internet gets exhausted with WhatsApp calls throughout the day with his family who were forced to move to their village in Uttar Pradesh’s Gorakhpur because of the pandemic. “In the village, people sleep early. So, in the late evening hours, I feel lonely. I am used to living with my family in this house. Then I often connect to the Wi-Fi device in the next block and watch a movie on YouTube,” said 40-year-old Kumar, who likes watching Hindi-dubbed versions of Telugu and Tamil movies on YouTube.However, his neighbour, Mantoo Jha, who too is a factory worker, often gets irked when movies get stuck mid-way. “There is no point living close to a Wi-Fi device. The service is poor. I cannot even do a video call with my family back home (in Bihar’s East Champaran district). I had to get an additional SIM,” said Jha.Earlier this month, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal chaired a review meeting and directed officials in the public works department to continue with the scheme, giving it a fresh push to improve the service.The public works department is currently preparing a detailed action plan, regarding identification of areas where new hotspots should be installed and the scale of the second phase of the drive which is likely to be launched in another few months, to improve connectivity issues, said the senior government official.Experts highlighted the importance of the scheme in bridging the digital divide, especially in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic, but they also stressed that the government has to focus on improving the quality of the service.“Bridging the digital divide through free or affordable access to connectivity in urban slums and rural spaces is key to deliver social impact delivery systems at scale. But governments need to also be very invested in building last mile awareness on online safety mechanisms because many users are first generation learners or marginalised children with no support or adult supervision. Free internet shouldn’t lead to an increase in cyber crime cases against children or other vulnerable groups. Immense care has to be taken to balance these two outcomes,” said Sonal Kapoor, founder CEO, Protsahan India Foundation, a leading child rights NGO in India.Debolina Kundu, professor at the National Institute of Urban Affairs, said: “This initiative would help the government localise sustainable development goals which aim to substantially increase the number of youth and adults with relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills needed for employment, decent jobs, and entrepreneurship. Importantly, the proportion of households in Delhi with computer facility was 34.7% and those with internet facility was 55.8% as compared to 23.4% and 42% respectively for urban India (average) as per the 75th round of the National Sample Survey (NSS) data (2017-18) … Interestingly, 28.6% of the very poor households in Delhi had internet facilities, as per the sample survey. The pandemic induced closure of schools since early 2020 has shifted education to the online mode. Accessibility to computers and smart phones with uninterrupted internet facility has become the sine qua non for imparting education to the children. The poor households living in slums and informal settlements are likely to benefit immensely from this scheme.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/despite-issues-city-s-free-wi-fi-scheme-is-still-a-hit-101629163720075.html
17-08-2021||Lucknow||UP BJP playing ‘dirty politics’ over floods, says Mayawati||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Monday slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), alleging that saffron brigade was playing “dirty politics” over floods which was shameful and should be condemned as well. She was reacting to BJP Uttar Pradesh’s Twitter post on Sunday, wherein it was stated that while BJP government and chief minister Yogi Adityanath was busy organising relief and rescue operation in the flood hit areas, the BSP was holding caste conferences instead of helping the flood victims. “Instead of launching ‘Jan ashirvad yatra’ the BJP should have organised ‘flood victims assistance yatra’ to help the flood victims in Uttar Pradesh,” she said. Mayawati said that the success of the Prabudh class conference as well as the large turnout in the meetings were giving sleepless nights to the BJP leaders. “The leaders of the saffron brigade are using all tricks to ensure failure of the conferences organised by the BSP. The people are aware of the tactics of the BJP leadership, they will give befitting reply to the ruling party in the elections next year,” she said. “The BJP leaders are jittery with the response of the conferences organised by the BSP across the state. To hide its failure, the BJP government is indulged in shameful act. It is adopting various ploys to stop the BSP conferences. The BJP is not going to get any political gain by stopping the opposition parties’ programmes, rather it gives an indication that BJP is losing ground fast in Uttar Pradesh,” she said. Mayawati said, in the Monsoon session of the legislative assembly commencing from Tuesday, the BSP MLAs would raise the public issues on the floor of the house. “The BSP will also raise its voice against the three farm laws and ensure that farms laws are not implemented in UP. The BSP will raise the issue of the deteriorating law and order and neglect of the patients during the Covid pandemic,” she added. Third phase of Brahmin conference begins The third phase of the Brahmin conference organised by the BSP commenced at Barabanki on Monday. The conference will be organised at Varanasi on Tuesday. Later, the conferences chaired by party national general secretary, Satish Chandra Mishra, will be held in several districts of Central and East UP till August 24.Addressing conferences at Barabanki and Jaunpur districts, Mishra claimed, “The misrule by the BJP is leading the country to destruction. The people belonging to Brahmin and Dalit communities are being harassed by the BJP government.” Mishra said, the BSP has appointed Dharamvir Chaudhary, Dr MH Khan and Faizan Khan as the spokespersons of the party’s state unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-playing-dirty-politics-over-floods-says-mayawati-101629145168137.html

The petitioner stated that the gram panchayat had put an auction notice for 150 trees in a local newspaper, which was to be held on July 26. But, it was postponed, and before a fresh auction notice could be given, he filed the instant PIL. It stated that cutting the 150 trees will adversely affect the environment and only 3% of the area in Punjab is under forest cover, whereas the national goal is 35%.Advocate Sunaina, who was arguing the case on behalf of advocate HC Arora, stated that sarpanches of various gram panchayats, in connivance with the BDPOs, are auctioning off trees on the gram panchayat land.She further prayed that power to permit cutting of trees not be conferred to an official below the rank of administrator secretary of the department.While issuing notice of motion to the state government; director, rural development and panchayats, deputy commissioner and gram panchayat concerned, the HC Bench restrained them from cutting trees on the gram panchayat land till the next date of hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-hc-passes-interim-restraining-order-on-cutting-of-trees-on-panchayat-land-101629144929756.html

The court also issued notices to executives of such websites allegedly owned by Chinese nationals and involved in online gambling. The bench comprising acting chief justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and justice Rajendra Kumar passed the order while hearing a petition filed by Shimla Shri Tripathi, a social worker. The court fixed September 15 as the next date of hearing in the case.According to the petitioner, more than 500 such websites are operating in India which offer gambling games like colour predicting game wherein a player has to place a certain amount to win an amount greater than the bet placed, guessing the outcome of the colour or the combination of numbers, within the window which opens every 3 minutes and freezes 30 seconds before the declaration of colour.It was alleged in the petition that first such websites let players win easily to lure more players but later on when players in large numbers start putting larger bets, website owners start manipulating the results thereby ultimately most of the players lose in the game while website owners illegally gain from the games.Appearing for the petitioner, advocate Shashank Shri Tripathi argued, “These websites also deduct huge amounts of money from winners in the name of tax on gambling claiming that the same will be paid to the government. Some digital payment apps are facilitating illegal gambling on gambling sites. Therefore, the government must take action against such apps.”“Chinese citizens are owning such gambling websites. Websites are usually controlled from Chinese servers and are a planned scheme of fraud,” advocate Tripathi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-hc-seeks-govt-reply-on-pil-seeking-ban-on-online-gambling-101629144628114.html

Afghan students pursuing courses like MTech, MBA and PhD at Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences (SHUATS) at Naini are offering prayers for the safety of their family members in Afghanistan and making desperate efforts to contact them. “These are tough times for all Afghans. We are offering prayers that our family members remain safe during this transition and we all get to see them in a peaceful environment,” said Zakir Ullah Fazli,a PhD student. With him were other students from Afghanistan including Faruk Ullah (pursuing MTech course), Nawazis Razaye (MSc), Ziaullhaq Zia (MBA), Shafiullah Stankzai (MTech), all of whom hail from different cities of Afghanistan including Kabul, Kunar, Ahmad Aba and Kunduz among others. “We are praying to Allah for better days for our country which has a rich history. I hope everything is peaceful again and we all can visit our homes. I was able to speak to my family members two days back and things were bad there with Taliban heading towards Kabul. I am very worried,” said Zakir Ullah. SHUATS international division’s liaison officer Mohammad Majid said efforts were being made to ensure that all Afghan students of SHUATS get to talk to their family members using the helpline number now made functional. We are extending all support to them, he added. Mohammad Majid shared that till outbreak of Covid-19, 120 students from Afghanistan were enrolled at SHUATS but left. “Presently we have nine students from Afghanistan admitted enrolled with us and out whom four are already in their home country while five are here,” he added.

Malik Mohhammad, a student of MA Hindi at AU and hailing from Kabul shared, “I was able to speak to my family three days back and I am unable to connect to them since Sunday. I somehow managed to talk to one of my relatives who informed me that my parents were safe,” he added. Malik said, “Future of many students like me, who are studying here on fellowship, hangs in balance till the new regime extends the financial support, otherwise we will not be able to continue our studies”. Abdul Rehman, a BCom final year students at AU hails from Laghman province of Afghanistan said “I was able to talk to my family members. All of them are staying at home and scared. I am very worried for their safety as Taliban now controls the entire area where my family lives,” he said.

Addressing a gathering to pay his tributes to martyr Karnail Singh Isru on his death anniversary, senior SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia said Punjabis were surprised at Sidhu’s latest announcement promising to provide power at ₹3 per unit for domestic use. He asked Sidhu to explain who was stopping him from implementing this promise now when the state is being run by his party government. He said the truth was that Sidhu had refused to become power minister of the state two years ago despite having the opportunity to provide relief to people in that capacity.Majithia alleged that Sidhu was never serious about resolving the problems of the people and would never be. The SAD leader also asked the PPCC president why promises made to people by Congress on the eve of 2017 assembly elections were not kept when he was a minister for two and a half years which comprised half of the government’s tenure. “Where is ‘Ghar Ghar Naukri’ and full loan waiver for farmers?,” he asked. He said Sidhu was now again trying to befool people.He also announced that Khanna will be made a district after formation of the SAD-BSP government in 2022 as a tribute to Issru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bikram-majithia-slams-navjot-sidhu-for-misleading-punjab-s-people-101629144268059.html

Following the instructions, SHO Jagjit Singh deputed security, traffic police and a special team to perform the guard of honour for the national flag.This didn’t sit well with the Congress leaders, Ayali alleged, and the SSP was pressured to transfer the SHO.When contacted, SSP Sohal, while refusing to go into specifics, said it was an internal matter. “The SHO has been transferred on administrative grounds,” he said.Congress leaders belonging to the area refused to comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/solitary-transfer-of-mullanpur-dakha-sho-raises-eyebrows-101629144088661.html

The minister of state was in Kathua, part of his Udhampur parliamentary constituency, to inaugurate a high-efficiency oxygen generation plant at Government Medical College, established through the PM-Cares Fund.“There is a change in the thinking of the people (in Kashmir). The residents of Srinagar who are moving around in lanes and bylanes want a change and be part of (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi’s New India like the people in other parts of the country,” Singh told reporters after dedicating the oxygen plant to the public.However, he said there is a “veil of fear” which is stopping the public from expressing themselves openly. “I feel it is the last phase of terrorism there,” the minister said, responding to a question about the large scale Independence Day celebrations in the valley.Flag hoisting ceremonies were held at many places in the valley Sunday.Referring to the setting up of the fourth oxygen plant at GMC Kathua within a short span during the coronavirus pandemic, the minister said the prime minister has a special concern for Jammu and Kashmir, especially the gateway district of Kathua.“The prime minister in his independence day speech of 90 minutes from the Red Fort deliberated in detail about J&K and northeastern states. He talked about the delimitation commission in J&K and assembly elections in the coming months,” Singh said.The BJP government set up District Development Councils (DDC) for the first time and completed the elections to Panchayats in the past two years despite “hurdles”, the minister said without elaborating, but referring apparently to regional parties including National Conference and PDP which boycotted the panch and sarpanch elections besides the local bodies polls. Asked about the developments in Afghanistan, the union minister said the “External Affairs Ministry is taking note of such things”.“I am not supposed to comment on the issue but the concerned ministry has taken note of the happenings there,” he said.The minister reached Kathua, which falls in his home constituency of Udhampur, and attended several functions in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/change-in-people-s-thinking-visible-in-kashmir-jitendra-singh-101629143608205.html
17-08-2021||Chandigarh||Former Punjab minister Anil Joshi, other BJP leaders to join SAD on August 20||Former Punjab cabinet minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Anil Joshi along with other saffron party leaders is all set to join the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in Chandigarh on August 20. Joshi will be inducted into the SAD fold by party president Sukhbir Singh Badal, it is learnt. Former Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha state chief Mohit Gupta, who hails from Bathinda, a former ex-MLA from Hoshiarpur district, a former Ludhiana deputy mayor and a party leader who contested the previous assembly polls from Ludhiana district are among others likely to switch over to SAD. “We found that only SAD can serve the interests of all Punjabis. We have already worked closely with the Akali Dal both at the government and the organisations levels,” said Joshi, confirming his joining schedule. The BJP in July had expelled Joshi for six years after he criticised state and the central leadership for mishandling the farm agitation. Interestingly, Joshi’s relationship with the SAD was not so cordial when he was local bodies minister during the Parkash Singh Badal-led previous government in Punjab. In 2015, Joshi as minister had compared the then SAD-led state government’s rule with that of Aurangzeb’s after his brother was attacked allegedly by Akali workers in Tarn Taran. “These are things of the past now. When you run a coalition government such things happen sometimes,” said Joshi. Also, he will be fielded by SAD from the Amritsar North assembly segment, which he has represented twice, in the 2022 Punjab elections. According to the Akali Dal-Bahujan Samaj Party coalition agreement, the latter is to field its candidate from the Amritsar North constituency but the seat is likely to be taken back by replacing it. Joshi’s switchover to the SAD is seen as a major shot in the arm for the SAD which has dearth of firebrand Hindu faces, especially in urban areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/former-punjab-minister-anil-joshi-other-bjp-leaders-to-join-sad-on-august-20-101629143489658.html
17-08-2021||Chandigarh||Worried over safety, 120 Sikh, Hindu families huddle up in Kabul gurdwara||Concerned over their safety in Afghanistan, particularly after the fall of Kabul to the Taliban, nearly 120 Sikh and Hindu families have taken refuge at Gurdwara Karte Parwan in the national capital, making desperate efforts to be evacuated from the war-torn country. Once a sizeable minority community having historic shrines in the country, the number of Sikhs has been reduced to a few hundred due to back-to-back attacks by the extremists. The fresh situation has triggered fears of their complete exit from the country. Narinder Pal Singh, a member of parliament in Afghanistan, said over phone, “Approximately 100 Sikh families are staying at the gurdwara. Though we are feeling safer here, we cannot say anything as the situation is uncertain. There are no flights for us to be evacuated out of the country but we are trying to make arrangements.” Singh is son of Avtar Singh Khalsa, a member of parliament, who along with other Afghan Sikh leaders and activists was killed in a suicide bomb attack in 2018 at Jalalabad.In a video, the Sikhs staying in the Kabul gurdwara on Monday said, “The situation in Afghanistan is quite critical. We don’t know what will happen next. We urge the Sikhs in the US and Canada to evacuate us and take us to their countries.”Hira Singh, a leader of Afghan Sikhs who migrated to India and now lives in Delhi, said, “I am in touch with our fellow community members in Afghanistan but they are not speaking to us for last two days. I tried calling them twice since today morning, but they are declining my calls. We are also worried.” “As per my information, the Sikhs are safe at the Afghan gurdwara. Fortunately, no untoward incident has happened with them yet,” he said. He said, “The Sikhs left Jalalabad and travelled 150 km to the Kabul gurdwara. They are also carrying saroops of Guru Granth Sahib and sacred gutkas (handy books of gurbani) and pothis (gurbani scriptures) from historic Guru Nanak Darbar gurdwara and another Sikh shrine at Jalalabad.” The sangat staying at the Kabul gurdwara includes about 50 Hindus. The men are guarding the foundry wall of the gurdwara, it is learnt. On the intervening night of Sunday and Monday, some mischievous elements tried to open the gurdwara gate, but those guarding the shrine are learnt to have foiled the attempt.Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president Manjinder Singh Sirsa said, “I am in constant touch with the head of the Kabul gurdwara committee. We have been informed that more than 320 members of minority communities (nearly 50 Hindus and 270 Sikhs) are living in Ghazni and Jalalabad have taken refuge in Karte Parwan Gurdwara Sahib in Kabul in wake of recent developments”, said He said, “The Taliban leaders have met them and assured them of their safety. We are hopeful that Hindus and Sikhs would be able to live a safe life despite political churning in Afghanistan.” “I assured them to take measures to ensure their safety and evacuation”, added Sirsa.Former DSGMC chief Manjit Singh GK also met Delhi-based Afghan Sikh leaders. “We shall do our best to help our brethren there,” he said.“Though the Taliban have assured them of their safety, their evacuation is paramount in such a situation. We are establishing contact with the Centre as well as representatives of the Canada and UK governments to carry them to safety,” said Ravi Singh, founder head of the Khalsa Aid, a humanitarian organisation.Puneet Singh Chandok, president, Indian World Forum, said, “We are in constant touch with ministry of external affairs (MEA), Air India and some international agencies for early evacuation of Indians and Indian-origin people from Afghanistan.” Hira Singh said, “There are a little more than 60 gurdwaras in Afghanistan. Sikh families were earlier staying at seven gurdwaras of Kabul, two in Jalalabad, two in Ghazni among others. But now, most of them are camping at Gurdwara Karte Parwan in Kabul.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/taliban-onslaught-worried-over-safety-120-sikh-hindu-families-huddle-up-in-kabul-gurdwara-101629143489149.html

My govt is willing to extend any help needed to ensure their safe evacuation”.The CM on Sunday had said that there was a need to reman extra vigilant at all borders of the country, saying Afghanistan’s “fall” to the Taliban “does not augur well” for India.“Afghanistan’s fall to #Taliban doesn’t augur well for our country. It’ll strengthen the Sino-Pak nexus against India (China has already sought militia’s help on Uyghur). The signs are not at all good, we need to be extra vigilant now at all our borders,” Singh had said in a tweet on Sunday.On Saturday, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, an apex gurdwara body, had urged the Union government to ensure the safety of Sikhs living in Afghanistan and make unconditional arrangements to bring those Sikhs who want to come to India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amarinder-urges-mea-to-arrange-evacuation-of-indians-stuck-in-afghan-gurdwara-101629143487837.html
17-08-2021||Mumbai||Fashion designer Sabyasachi under fire for recent collection||Fashion designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee and Swedish fast-fashion brand H&M have been under fire since August 12 on two counts: that their newly launched collaboration, a collection called Wanderlust, is a work of cultural appropriation, and that it was supposed to be accessible to a larger audience but the pricing of the items is out of the reach of even the average H&M buyer (a cotton sari is priced at ₹9,999).The cultural appropriation issue stems from the fact that the H&M website states that “a key highlight of this collection is Indian textile and print traditions brought to life by the Sabyasachi Art Foundation, meticulously crafted embroidery and multicultural silhouettes”. But the prints have been rendered digitally. Some, like the Sanganeri print which is GI tagged to a specific community of artisans, have been altered slightly, but remain reminiscent of the original.The designer has now received an open letter signed by 15 Indian crafts associations and collectives, including Crafts Council of India, Crafts Council of Karnataka, and the All India Artisans & Craftworkers Welfare Association. The signatories are concerned that the collection draws heavily from traditional craftsmanship, but it is unclear if artisans were involved in any way or are benefiting from the collection.Incidentally, the collection has sold out. (And Mukherjee issued an apology on August 16, for the fact that the site was unable to cope with traffic, and there was not enough stock to meet demand.)“Given Mukherjee’s long association with traditional craftsmanship and slow fashion, a digitally printed sari costing a large sum could also be mistaken by consumers for the real handcrafted thing and this becomes a concern adding to the crisis of authenticity,” said Meera Goradia, co-founder of Creative Dignity, which is a network of artisans, craft associations and stakeholders, and a signatory to the letter.“This was an incredible opportunity to position India’s design and craftsmanship on the global map,” the open letter states. It goes on to say… “imagine the sheer potential of this story had it only said, ‘Handmade in India’, supporting millions of jobs… in communities that need it the most. Even if half the collection had been made by artisans, it would have made such an impact at a time of economic crisis like this pandemic…”The letters additionally asks: “Have the artisan communities that have the proprietary rights to these designs been credited or compensated in any way? In the case of some of the designs used in ‘Wanderlust’, the Sanganeri print artisans have a Geographical Indication registration.”“We do not have any issue with design collaborations. As a nationwide, multi-stakeholder movement, we do however want to highlight the many gaps in the Sabyasachi x H&M effort as it directly impacts India’s artisan communities and their future,” said Goradia. Approached for comment, Mukherjee told HT that he and his team were framing a response to the letter, but declined to offer any immediate response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fashion-designer-sabyasachi-under-fire-for-recent-collection-101629143372420.html

In the coming days, technologically, we will be dealing with the issue more efficiently. Systems are being put in place,” he said.On cross-border infiltration, Deswal said these incidents have been taking place for long and the security forces have foiled such attempts in the past.He said matters between the two sides are resolved peacefully at flag meetings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/keeping-a-close-watch-on-situation-in-afghanistan-bsf-dg-101629143310212.html

17-08-2021||Mumbai||Degree college 1st list today in Mumbai; 538K applications received||A day before the University of Mumbai (MU) is scheduled to release the first general merit list for undergraduate (UG) degree courses, data revealed that over 350,000 students have submitted 538,000 applications for various courses (one student can apply to more than one course). The first general merit list for UG courses in MU-affiliated colleges will be released at 11am on Tuesday.“Students whose names appear in the first general merit list will have time between 18 and 25 August to pay the fees and confirm their seats at the allotted college,” said a statement released by the university late on Monday. Figures shared by the university shows that once again Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) course has attracted the maximum applications (144,000), followed by Bachelor in Management Studies (BMS) with 115,000 applications. BCom in Accounting and Finance (BAF) has received 71,243 applications, while Bachelor in Arts (BA) has received 44,008 applications. Increasing Covid-19 cases forced most education boards to scrap their Class 12 exams this year and instead assess students on the basis of their performance in Classes 10, 11 and 12. The final result brought forward an explosion of students joining the 90% bandwagon. While the Indian School Certificate Examinations (ICSE) and Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) schools boasted of nearly 50% or more of their Class 12 students scoring above 90-95% this year. The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) announced Class 12 results this week and the number of 90% scorers across the state jumped 12-folds compared to last year. For the first time ever, 46 Class 12 students also managed to score a perfect 100% this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/degree-college-1st-list-today-in-mumbai-538k-applications-received-101629142949238.html
17-08-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana man shoots himself dead with licensed revolver||A 40-year-old spare parts trader ended his life by shooting himself twice with his licensed revolver at his house in Durgapuri, Haibowal, on Monday.A suicide note was recovered from the house in which the deceased blamed two men for driving him to suicide.Named as Rajan Jain of Karol Bagh and Harish Sabharwal of 33 Futta Road in the note, the duo has been booked under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) of the Indian Penal Code. “The deceased’s wife and children were away at Rajasthan to pay obeisance at a shrine, but his elderly parents were present on the ground floor of the house when he took the extreme step on the first floor,” said additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, City 3) Sameer Verma.“He shot himself in the chest with his .32-bore licensed revolver and died on the spot. His elderly parents mistook the gunshots for something falling on the roof. They went upstairs to check and found his room bolted from inside. When he didn’t respond despite persistent knocking, the couple summoned their younger son, who was out for some work,” the ADCP said.When the brother came in and forced the door open, the family was shocked to find the trader lying dead in a pool of blood and immediately called the police.The ADCP, assistant commissioner of police (ACP, West) Gurpreet Singh, along with Haibowal police reached the spot and recovered a suicide note, accusing Rajan Jain and Harish Sabharwal of forcing him to end his life. The deceased also sought forgiveness from his family.“As per preliminary investigation, Rajan and Harish had been harassing the trader over some money that he owed them. He owned a spare parts shop on Gill Road. According to his family, he was stressed for the past few days,” the ADCP said, adding that teams had been despatched to arrest the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-man-shoots-himself-dead-with-licensed-revolver-101629142947855.html
17-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees 10 more Delta Plus cases, tally now 76||Ten more Delta Plus cases have been identified in Maharashtra taking the tally to 76. Of the new cases, six are from Kolhapur, three from Ratnagiri and one from Sindhudurg. All the 10 patients have recovered completely. The Delta variant is now a variant of concern globally and is currently the predominant strain in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Delta variant is more than two times contagious than the previous variants. The Delta has further mutated to B.1.617.2.1 or AY.1 which is known as Delta Plus. There are now a total of 13 sub-lineages identified globally from AY.1 to AY.12 and AY.3.1. “In Maharashtra, we have found at least five sub-lineages including AY.1. AY.2, AY.3 and AY.12,” state’s surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate told Hindustan Times. Of the 76 patients with Delta Plus identified so far, 39 have required hospitalisation, while the rest recuperated at home. Five of the patients have succumbed to the infection. As of July 31, a total of 11,968 samples have been sent for genome sequencing from Maharashtra. Of these, 8,089 were detected with the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) of the novel coronavirus. The state has at least 20 cases are of the AY.3 sub-lineage that has been on the rise in the US for the past few weeks. The state’s samples also have 31 cases of the AY.1 sub-lineage and 10 cases of AY.2 sub-lineage. Medical experts said that it is difficult to analyse the impact of these sub-lineages as the number of samples are few. According to Awate, the sub-lineages- AY.1, AY.2, AY.3, AY.12- found in Maharashtra have all been clubbed under the Delta Plus category owing to the lack of nomenclature attached to these newer mutations. “Data from the UK suggests that the Delta Plus variant is more virulent and can have immune escape response to vaccines and monoclonal antibodies,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the Covid-19 task force of Maharashtra. “But it is too early to comment on its behaviour as we have few identified cases,” he said. In June, the Union health ministry declared that Delta Plus was a variant of concern for the country as it had characteristics like increased transmissibility, stronger binding to receptors of lung cells and a potential reduction in monoclonal antibody response. A recent study carried out by researchers based in Boston that is yet to be peer-reviewed observed that transmission of the Delta variant sub-lineage AY.3 may occur among vaccinated persons even in the more controlled environment of an inpatient medical-surgical ward. “It remains to be determined whether the Delta variant AY.3 lineage is more transmissible than the Delta Variant B.1.617.2,” the researchers said in the paper. “Our findings do raise concern that without stricter risk mitigation, nosocomial (originating in a hospital) transmission of the Delta variant and Delta sub-lineages will occur more frequently than with prior, less transmissible variants, even in vaccinated persons,” researchers said. A state health official said that aggressive contact tracing has been carried out in the identified Delta Plus cases. A few cluster infections have been found linked to the Delta Plus cases. Of the 76 patients identified so far, 10 were fully vaccinated while 12 were partially vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-10-more-delta-plus-cases-tally-now-76-101629142771503.html
17-08-2021||Chandigarh||Fearing Taliban regime, Afghan students seek visa extension||With the Taliban taking over Kabul, several Afghan students studying at Rohtak’s Maharshi Dayanand University are scrambling to apply for visa extension. Fifty-two Afghan students were enrolled in the 2019-20 academic session and 12 in 2020-21, says MDU centre of international academic affairs dean Ajay Rajan. The Visas of most will expire by November-end. “We have extended the visa of one student and will look into other students’ cases as and when they approach us,” Rajan said.Abdul Rahim Wardak, who is pursuing a masters in public administration, said, “My visa expires in a couple of days. All of us are hoping to get a visa extension as the situation in Afghanistan has turned violent. I have been trying to contact my family for a month, but to no avail. We are also facing financial problems as we are unable to contact our families. On Tuesday, a delegation of Afghan students will approach MDU officials and request them to extend our visas for a year.” Wardak has just appeared for the final semester exams and is waiting for the result. “ I want to continue to study at MDU, and will look for a job to meet my expenses,” he added. Around nine Afghan students are still in Rohtak, while many are stuck in Afghanistan. A student of public administration, who is in Afghanistan, said the situation in Mazar-i-Sharif, the fourth largest Afghan city is volatile with people not being allowed to venture out of their homes.“ My family has been asking me to approach MDU authorities to get a visa to travel to India. My visa expired last month. After the Taliban takes charge, it will not be possible to go to the Kabul airport. I urge the Indian government to evacuate all Afghan students who are studying in India,” he said, his voice cracking with emotion during the telephonic conversation. Another Afghan student stuck in Kabul said he will travel to India once the situation improves. “My visa expires in September. I have contacted officials at MDU and they assured me that they will extend my visa for a year. The Indian government is our only hope. Other countries have fled, leaving us in a war-like situation,” the student said over the phone.Indian National Student Organisation (INSO) national president Pradeep Deswal, said they will meet the vice-chancellors of different universities in the northern region and request them to extend the study visa of Afghan students for a year.“ We will also provide financial support to Afghan students, if needed,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fearing-taliban-regime-afghan-students-seek-visa-extension-101629142770326.html
17-08-2021||Chandigarh||Bargari sacrilege: Faridkot court initiates process to declare 3 dera members as POs||A Faridkot district court on Monday started proceedings to declare three members of the Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda’s national committee as proclaimed offenders (PO) in connection with 2015 Bargari sacrilege cases as the special investigation team (SIT) failed to nab them. The court of judicial magistrate Tarjani initiated PO proceedings against three Haryana residents — Sandeep Bareta, Pardeep Kaler and Harsh Dhuri — after three arrest warrants against them in two sacrilege cases wherein torn pages of a “bir” (copy of Guru Granth Sahib) were found scattered in Bargari and three derogatory posters were put up near gurdwaras at Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala villages in 2015, returned unexecuted. “Non-bailable warrants issued against the accused since July 23 have remained unexecuted. They are evading the service or concealing themselves from the execution of non-bailable warrants. Now, proclamation under Section 82 of the CrPC be issued against them for September 20,” the judicial magistrate said. Naming the three as conspirators in the Bargari sacrilege and derogatory posters cases, the SIT had filed a challan in the court last month. They have already been declared POs in three other sacrilege cases as police have failed to nab them since 2018 when they were first named in cases connected to sacrilege incidents in Moga and Bathinda districts in 2015. Bareta, Kler and Dhuri were also named as accused in the Malke and Gurusar cases. Torn pages of Guru Granth Sahib were found at Malke village in Moga district in November 2015 and Gurusar (Bhagta) village in Bathinda district in October 2015. Last year, they were named as accused in the “bir” theft case. The SIT probing the case claims that Bareta, Kler and Dhuri are the key link in Punjab’s five sacrilege incidents that sparked state-wide protests in 2015. “The instructions to execute sacrilege at Bargari, Moga and Gurusar were given by Bareta, Kler and Dhuri to the district dera committee members,” say the SIT.The SIT also claims that derogatory posters were pasted near the Bargari gurdwara on the intervening night of September 24 and 25, 2015, by dera followers on Bareta, Kler and Dhuri’s directions. “Later, on their directions, pages of the bir, which was stolen from a gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala on June 1, 2015, were scattered at Bargari on October 12, 2015. They directed dera’s state committee member Mohinder Pal Bittu to steal a bir from gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village,” claims the SIT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bargari-sacrilege-faridkot-court-initiates-process-to-declare-3-dera-members-as-pos-101629142768119.html
17-08-2021||Mumbai||BMC to raze, rebuild part of Mumbai’s 1st skywalk at Bandra; traffic to BKC to be hit||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to demolish and rebuild a part of the city’s first skywalk in Bandra. BMC has taken the decision owing to the structural defects pointed out by a third-party auditor. Owing to the demolition and reconstruction, traffic on the station road leading to Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) is likely to be hit.The skywalk starts from SV Road in Bandra (West) up to the BKC junction. According to BMC officials, the stretch of the skywalk between the eastern side of Bandra station and the Western Express Highway will be rebuilt at the cost of around ₹16.2 crore. BMC has already floated bids for the work, and the last date for submitting bids is September 13. The civic body has set a target of 18 months, including the monsoon period, for the demolition and reconstruction of the skywalk. The civic body plans to reconstruct the skywalk as the difference in expenditure between carrying out major repairs and rebuilding it is narrow. “For now, we are taking a particular stretch of the Bandra East skywalk [for reconstruction]. A decision on the remaining such structures will be taken in the coming days. We plan to carry out demolition and reconstruction according to the traffic movement on the station road as it is not feasible to shut the road below,” said Satish Thosar, chief engineer of BMC’s bridges department. The skywalk was constructed by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) and later handed over to BMC for maintenance in 2015.During the 2019 monsoon season, a portion of the skywalk at Bandra (East) collapsed, injuring a woman. Following the incident, an audit was ordered into the stability of several skywalks. In August 2019, HT had reported that BMC was considering the demolition of a portion of the skywalk to make it structurally stable, but the execution of the plan was delayed owing to the Covid-induced lockdown.Apart from the Bandra skywalk, 23 more skywalks are due to undergo major repairs or reconstruction. Following the Himalaya Bridge collapse at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus in March 2019, BMC had appointed the Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI) to suggest major repairs for 24 skywalks, including the one at Bandra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-raze-rebuild-part-of-mumbai-s-1st-skywalk-at-bandra-traffic-to-bkc-to-be-hit-101629142708516.html

He has been arrested and has confessed to the crime, the police said.The cold-blooded murder came to light on Sunday morning after Sidhu Kumar, a labourer, visited the house to check on Sapan, who has not been answering his phone calls. Shocked to find Sapan lying dead on his bed, he immediately called the police. Joint commissioner of police (JCP, Rural) Sachin Gupta said the victim, who hailed from Madhepura, Bihar, was a labour contractor and also ran a printing unit on the ground floor of the house. He used to sleep in the printing unit, while his maternal uncle, Sarwan, a labourer, lived on the first floor with his wife and children.When police reached the house on being alerted about the murder, Sarwan initially claimed that an intruder killed his nephew, but kept changing his statements continuously raising police’s suspicion.When cops picked holes in his theory, he confessed that he had bludgeoned Sapan to death with an iron rod while he was asleep. The rod was recovered from the house.Found out about affair getting bail in drug case“Sarwan was serving two years in jail in a drug peddling case. He came out on bail in March this year. At home, he overheard a conversation between his wife and Sapan, and found out about their affair. Furious over his wife’s infidelity behind his back, he decided to murder Sapan,” the JCP said.“But Sapan left for Bihar in April to get married. He came back to Ludhiana in May and again left for Bihar within a week. Since his return to the city on July 27, Sarwan had been lying in wait for an appropriate time to execute the murder. He also confessed that he planned to throw his nephew’s body in a canal, but failed to drag the body,” he added.The victim’s parents and wife were alerted about the incident. The body was handed over to them after their arrival from Bihar on Monday.The accused is facing a murder case under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. He will be produced in court on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-man-discovers-wife-s-affair-with-nephew-bludgeons-him-to-death-101629142588028.html
17-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Demand for IVF treatment on rise in second Covid wave||Fertility clinics in the city that had witnessed a temporary halt in In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) treatments during the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic last year, saw couples starting or resuming their plan of conceiving, despite the second wave. With no end to the pandemic in sight, doctors said the couples who had postponed their fertility treatment in the first wave, are now queuing up at fertility clinics.“We couldn’t wait any longer for the IVF treatment since we realised that Covid-19 is here to stay,” said a 38-year-old Bhandup resident, who is an engineer. She got married in 2015 at the age of 32. The couple delayed their plans to have children since her husband, now 40, who works in the Hindi film industry as an animator, had to go to Chicago for his masters in animation in 2017. When they decided to start a family after his return in 2019, she was diagnosed with abnormalities in her ovulation (the monthly release of an egg from the ovaries). Doctors suggested she undergo ovulation induction (OI) that uses hormonal therapy to stimulate egg development and release for fertility.“In May 2019, I started my treatment. But it wasn’t helpful. So, doctors recommended intrauterine insemination (IUI),” she said. IUI is a procedure for treating infertility in which a small catheter is used to directly inject the sperm into the uterus around the time the ovary releases one or more eggs to be fertilised.The couple was scheduled for the first procedure on April 12, 2020, however, by then Covid-19 had already hit Mumbai city. “The virus was new. Since there were so many rumours that Covid-19 could even infect the foetus, we decided to stop the procedures till the pandemic gets over,” she said. But even after a year, in March, the pandemic showed no sign of receding across the globe with the mutation of the virus.After waiting for almost 13 months, they decided to undergo the procedure in May. To their surprise, she got pregnant on the first cycle. “There is only a 20% success rate in the first cycle for IUI procedure. After waiting for 13 months, I am finally pregnant,” she said. “Compared to the first wave, we were more confident in the second wave for fertility treatment. We were ready to take the risk,” she added.This is not an isolated case where couples postponed their IVF treatment amid the pandemic. Data provided by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) shows that around 8,000 women underwent IVF treatment in the city in 2016, which shot up to over 12,000 in 2019. However, following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, a health official from the civic body said there was a 50% drop in the number of couples opting for IVF treatment.“All fertility clinics were closed. Due to the national lockdown, people couldn’t travel for their regular IVF treatment and follow-up examination. Prospective parents were also scared of the possibility of the virus getting transmitted to the foetus. As a result, IVF treatment hit a roadblock,” said Dr Richa Jagtap, clinical director, consultant reproductive medicine, Nova IVF fertility, Mumbai.IVF treatment is a long-term process that requires multiple visits to the fertility clinic, involving scans, medications, and injections. “In the beginning, there were no clear guidelines and the research on Sars-Cov-2, a new virus, was limited. So, we had to stop procedures for 1-2 months. But now, the union health ministry has issued guidelines. All IVF centres are taking all precautionary measures for the safety of the mothers and babies,” said DrJagtap.Medical experts said couples who had put their plans to conceive a child on hold due to the Covid-19 don’t want to wait for long for IVF treatment since it’s now widely known that the virus will stay longer than anticipated.As per the IVF clinics, they are witnessing over 200% rise in IVF cycles compared to the first wave. For instance, Indira IVF recorded only 107 IVF cycles in April last year. This year in April, they conducted 2,780 cycles.“All patients who had postponed their IVF treatment are coming to clinics for fertility treatment. We are also getting a large number of new patients including single women who are opting for IVF treatment. Their fear about the virus has changed,” said Dr Kshitiz Murdia, chief executive officer and co-founder of Indira IVF.Murdia added, “In the last 18 months of the pandemic, citizens have adapted to it (existence of Covid-19). They know that with proper precautionary measures, the virus can’t infect the mother or the baby.:Dr Smita Mahale, former director, Indian Council of Medical Research- National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (ICMR-NIRRH), Parel said couples over the past year have been able to spend more time together due to lockdown triggered work-from-home life that put a stop to an hour-long daily commute to workplaces for a significant number. This, she said, has resulted in many couples wanting to have a child.“Lifestyles of couples has changed. They are eating more at home and exercising. They are more relaxed at home in the lockdown. Couples who were having problems conceiving are also now getting pregnant naturally, without IVF intervention,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaidemand-for-ivf-treatment-on-rise-in-second-covid-wave-101629142471510.html

Police have also recovered two hand grenades and as many fully-loaded pistols of .9mm. The arrest of the accused, identified as Amritpal Singh and Sammy of Amritsar, has averted a possible terrorist attack on or around Independence Day, said police in a statement.This comes days after the recovery of an improvised explosive device (IED) concealed in a tiffin box along with five hand grenades and 100 rounds of 9 mm pistol from a village in Amritsar. Senior superintendent of police (SSP-Amritsar rural) Gulneet Singh Khurana said: “A barricade was set up near Gharinda on Sunday night. During the midnight, the accused, who were on a motorcycle, were questioned and searched on the basis of suspicion. Following this, a pistol was recovered from one of the two accused. On quizzing, the accused told us that they were on their way to collect some arms and ammunition from near the border.”He said: “At the instance of the accused, a pistol and two hand grenades were recovered from Rajatal village situated along the barbed wire fence. The consignment was concealed underground.” “It is most likely that the consignment was smuggled from across the border. We are yet to investigate if the consignment was dropped by a drone or smuggled by using other methods,” the SSP said. Punjab director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta said the duo was operating on the directions of UK-based terrorist Gurpreet Singh Khalsa, who was also an accused in Ludhiana Shingar Cinema bomb blast case. Khalsa was, however, acquitted in the blast case by a Ludhiana court in 2014. Police sources said Khalsa flew to the UK in 2017.A senior police official, who didn’t wish to be named, said: “Khalsa and Amritpal Singh used to meet in Ludhiana during a movement of Bapu Surat Singh Khalsa in 2015. Khalsa come to limelight for his hunger strike as a form of peaceful protest against illegal and prolonged detention of political prisoners.”Police said Gurpreet had been working as a property dealer while Sammy works as a supervisor in a private company.A case under relevant sections of the Arms Act, and the Explosive Substance (Amendment) Act 2001, has been registered at Gharinda Police Station in Amritsar, said an official spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2-men-linked-to-uk-terror-group-held-grenades-pistols-recovered-101629142469046.html

17-08-2021||Mumbai||HC raps Maharashtra government for keeping crucial MPCB posts vacant for 14 years||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) recently rapped the state government for keeping the posts of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) vacant and not filling them up to the optimum level with expert members for 14 years. The court held that the presence of the expert members was very important to help MPCB maintain ecology and environment and hence, the state should inform within a month as to how much time would it take to fill up the posts. The division bench of justice SV Gangapurwala and justice RN Laddha, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) by non-governmental organisation (NGO) Lokjagar Foundation through its president Pandharinath Sable, was informed by senior advocate VD Sapkal that the state had not constituted MPCB as per law and many posts of expert members had remained vacant for more than 14 years. Elaborating on the vacant posts, Sakpal submitted that five members of the local authority and three non-officials representing the fields of agriculture, fishery and industry or trader were vacant. He added that though the posts of experts – which are honorary and would not cause any financial burden on the government – had also remained vacant, causing loss to the environment and ecology. The state had filed an affidavit admitting that the board was not constituted to its full strength of 17 members. The bench had observed that the affidavit had not mentioned on the steps being taken by the state to make the board functional to its optimum. The bench had then asked the government to provide steps to be taken for appointment of non-official members and the period within which the same could be done.In its order passed on August 5, the bench noted, “The MPCB has an important role to play in maintenance of ecology and environment. The expert members would always be an asset to the board...14 years is too long a period for the board not being constituted to its optimum.” The court then sought a positive response from the government over the time in which it would be constituting the board to its optimum level and inform it in the next hearing on September 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-raps-maharashtra-government-for-keeping-crucial-mpcb-posts-vacant-for-14-years-101629142287871.html

The Pune district administration and Pune railway division are working over the issue to resume the service.Last week, Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh and even both the civic bodies (Pune Municipal Corporation and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation) had allowed people who have been vaccinated with both doses to commute by local trains, but the decision has not been implemented yet.On the other hand, railways have asked the local governing bodies to issue identity cards to people who have been vaccinated with both doses and accordingly railways will issue monthly season tickets for Pune-Lonavala local train passengers.“As the state government has issued new guidelines about local train transportation, we have requested the Pune district administration to issue identity cards to passengers who have taken both the doses of Covid vaccination.Also, 14 days should be completed after the second dose, and only then Railways will issue monthly tickets to such passengers,” said Pune divisional railway manager (DRM) Renu Sharma.Since the countrywide lockdown began on March 23 last year, all the train operations in the Pune railway division were stopped.While in October 2020, the local trains resumed back in Pune which is a major transport mode for working people between Pune and Lonavla stretch. But again in March 2021 the train operations for the common public were stopped due to a surge in Covid-19 cases.Talking about the issue, Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “Instructions have been given to both the civic bodies to issue necessary identity cards, and the local train service would start for common public too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/local-trains-to-open-for-vaccinated-people-in-pune-101629142227286.html

Reacting to SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal’s comments, Manpreet said he (Sukhbir) was uttering gibberish remarks of ideological differences between them, but he had to introspect first before pointing out others. The SAD had failed the two key constituents that it always proclaimed to champion, he said in a statement, adding that it failed the farmers in passing the three farm bills and it was in cahoots with the BJP in destroying the backbone of Indian agriculture. Manpreet said that secondly, the SAD always claimed to be a champion for the cause of the Sikhs, but actually the party had let the community down time and again – be it the 1979 incident in Amritsar that triggered the Punjab crisis, or sacrilege incidents at Bargari and other places in 2015. “So, while I wish good luck to the Akali Dal, people are fully aware that it is an outdated and ideologically bankrupt party and like a failed bank, the cheques issued from their boastful coffers are bouncing and will always be,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-an-outdated-ideologically-bankrupt-party-says-manpreet-101629141987799.html

17-08-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC rejects compassionate appointment plea 26 yrs after death of rly staffer||The Bombay high court (HC), while dismissing the appeal of a woman against an order of the administrative tribunal – which had rejected her 2017 plea for compassionate appointment of her 27-year-old daughter in place of her husband – held that it would be a “mockery of the scheme” if an order contrary of the tribunals order was passed. HC stated that appointment on compassionate grounds scheme was to ensure that the family of the deceased government employee did not suffer poverty and was bound by a period of limitation and hence, the tribunal was right in rejecting the application of the woman who sought appointment under the scheme 26 years after her husband had passed away. The woman’s husband, a railway employee, had died while on duty in 1991. Though the railways had sought to know if she wanted a job after her husband’s death soon after his demise, she had not responded to the offer then. It was only when her daughter turned 26 years old, did she seek the benefit. Hence, HC deemed that as the woman and her daughter had managed to survive all these years without needing a job with the railways, it would be a mockery of the scheme if her appeal was allowed and the daughter was appointed on compassionate grounds after the passage of 26 years. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the appeal filed by Alka Govind Kumbhar, was informed by her lawyer that in December 2016, the woman had come to know about the appointment on compassionate ground scheme after her brother-in-law applied to the railways for the same. In February 2017, she had applied for the appointment under the scheme for her daughter. The advocate submitted that though his client had submitted all the documents sought by the railway officer concerned, in May 2018, she came to know that the application for appointing her daughter on compassionate grounds was rejected. However, the letter rejecting the application, dated March 2018, had not been conveyed to Kumbhar. Hence, she approached the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) in 2019 against the railways’ decision. After hearing all the sides, CAT had dismissed her plea in August 2019. Hence, she had appealed against CAT’s order in HC. Advocate TJ Pandian for the railways, however, opposed the appeal and submitted an affidavit which stated that there was no merit in the appeal and it should be rejected. Pandian submitted that the railways had closed the issue of appointment on compassionate grounds for the deceased, Govind Kumbhar, in 1992 after his wife had failed to respond to a letter issued by them. Pandian further submitted that even if the argument that the daughter was only 11 months old when Govind expired and hence she could not take up the job, she should have approached the railways on attaining the age of 18 years and not when she turned 27 years old. Pandian urged the court to reject the appeal, stating that the scheme was intended to help the family of the employee whose sudden death would have plunged the members in financial difficulties. But as the mother and daughter had survived all these years and the daughter also got married, she was no more in need of the job, HC rejected the appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-rejects-compassionate-appointment-plea-26-yrs-after-death-of-rly-staffer-101629141928583.html

17-08-2021||Mumbai||Viral fever cases in Mumbai on rise amid monsoon: Doctors||Although the number of Covid-19 infections has plunged, cases of viral fever have increased in the city. Doctors have warned against ignoring the symptoms and self-medication.Every year, during the monsoon season, the city records hundreds of viral fever cases. Last year, due to the national lockdown, the number of cases was limited. But this year, with the relaxation of Covid-19 related lockdown restrictions, the movement of people outside has increased, which has led to a rise in the cases of viral fever with cold and cough.“Monsoon provides a suitable environment for the viruses to thrive. After intermittent rain, we have recorded a rise of around 25% cases of viral fever in our outpatient department (OPD). Every year, the number of patients are recorded between the months of July and August,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair Hospital.As viral fever shares similar symptoms with Covid-19, all patients have to undergo a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test to avoid any misdiagnosis.“Flu fever and Covid-19 is difficult to distinguish clinically. We, therefore, recommend RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests for all suspected flu patients,” said Dr Manjusha Agarwal, senior consultant-internal medicine at Global Hospital, Parel.“A blood test is the best way to identify these viruses. There is one more provision of a test called BioFire for respiratory infections, which can give results very quickly and can differentiate between various viral respiratory infections and helps us decide the line of treatment,” Dr Sanjith Saseedharan, consultant and head of the Critical Care, SL Raheja Hospital, Mahim.Doctors in fever clinics have been instructed to check the medical history of patients with flu along with their domestic and international travel history and if they were in close contact with Covid-19 positive patients.“We should not be complacent and lower our testing threshold thinking Covid-19 is regressing. We need to be more careful and vigilant of all fever cases coming to us now, given the reopening of train travel, restaurants and with festivals around the corner, ” said Dr Agarwal.Doctors have warned against ignoring symptoms and opting for self-medication amid the pandemic. “Though Covid-19 positivity rate has gone below 1%, the pandemic isn’t over yet. The virus is still present. Those with flu-like symptoms should get tested or consult a doctor immediately,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/viral-fever-cases-in-mumbai-on-rise-amid-monsoon-doctors-101629141867980.html
17-08-2021||Lucknow||Controversy after BJP leader hoists national flag at Agra’s Jama Masjid||AGRA Independence Day celebrations at the Jama Masjid in Agra led to a controversy after Shahar Mufti Abdul Khubaib Roomi and a local Congress leader Haji Jamiluddin condemned UP Minority Commission chairman and BJP leader Ashfaq Saifi for flag hoisting and singing nation anthem at a madarsa on the premises. The event was hosted by Local Islamia Agency, which manages the affairs of the Jama Masjid. In an audio that went viral on social media, the Shahar Mufti condemned such events at the Jama Masjid, saying they were “against Islamic values and the offenders should fear the Almighty.” But the chairman of UP Minority Commission, who was present there as chief guest, justified the flag hoisting and singing of national anthem on the premises. “This was one of the many events organised on the occasion of Independence Day. I was present as chief guest at the Jama Masjid, where the programme was hosted by a madarsa, which is recognized by the government,” stated Ashfaq Saifi on Monday. “As usual on I-Day, the national anthem was sung, the national flag was hoisted and ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ was chanted. India got independence after contribution from all communities and as such there cannot be a religious divide in it. A controversy is unnecessarily being created over an I-Day event organized at Jama Masjid in Agra,” stated Saifi. Local Congress leader and national vice president of All India Jamaitul Quresh, Haji Jamilluddin Qureshi, stood in support of the Shahar Mufti and condemned the event organized at Jama Masjid. “There was no logic in using the premises of Jama Masjid for holding an Independence Day event. It could have been organized anywhere near Jama Masjid, in the open. The Jama Masjid premises has its own sanctity and has been dragged into controversy needlessly by organizing such an event,” he said. However, chairman of Local Islamia Agency, Haji Aslam Qureshi, the host of the event and the one who invited the UP Minority Commission chairman for it, justified holding the Independence Day event on Jama Masjid compound. He demanded security for himself alleging that he was receiving threats after organizing the event. “Shahar Mufti is not justified in opposing the Independence Day event at Jama Masjid and has used harsh words against us. We would file an FIR and seek security for ourselves in wake of threats being issued for hosting Independence Day event at Jama Masjid,” said Qureshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/controversy-after-bjp-leader-hoists-national-flag-at-agra-s-jama-masjid-101629141808809.html

17-08-2021||Mumbai||Sharad Pawar wants Congress leaders on Pegasus probe committee||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief and former Union defence minister Sharad Pawar on Monday said that issues such as the alleged Pegasus snooping case are dealt with by the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), the home ministry or the security advisor and not by the defence ministry, which had given a clarification on it. Pawar also called for the inclusion of one of three senior Congress leaders in the committee being constituted to probe the alleged Pegasus snooping, so that the investigation gets credibility.While addressing a press conference in NCP’s Mumbai office, Pawar said that if a committee is being constituted under the observation of the Apex court, one of the members should be from among senior Congress leaders P Chidambaram, Abhishek Manu Singhvi or Kapil Sibal. “I cannot interfere in the Supreme Court’s matter, but the inclusion of one of these leaders will help in making the probe credible as they have thoroughly studied the entire issue. I have been told that such a committee is being constituted to probe the snooping,” he said.Pawar said that the though the Centre has been claiming that it had no role to play in alleged Pegasus snooping episode and though the defence minister has said that they did not deal with any Israeli agency in this issue, such types of deals are done by other agencies. “Such deals are not done by the defence ministry, but RAW, ministry of home affairs or security advisors generally handle such things. I am not suggesting they have done it,” he added.He was referring to the alleged surveillance against politicians, activists and journalist using spyware Pegasus, disruption in the Parliament during the recent monsoon session over the issue and the latest developments in the Apex court during hearing over the case.Pawar also termed the disruption in the Parliament and the treatment meted out to the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha as “unprecedented”. “The Opposition, during its meeting with the government ahead of the monsoon session, had clearly said that it wanted to debate on the Pegasus issue, farm laws and the rising fuel prices. The government was non-committal over the timing of debate on these issues, which led to disruption of the houses. What happened on August 11 was unprecedented, which I had never witnessed in 54 years of my life as a parliamentarian. Force was used by security personnel against parliamentarians in an attempt to indirectly attack them inside Rajya Sabha,” he said.Pawar rubbished reports that stated that he had tried to avoid West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee during the latter’s New Delhi visit during the monsoon session of the Parliament. “I had to rush back to Mumbai on the day Mamatadidi asked for an appointment. I told her that I will meet her in Kolkata. It is true that Opposition parties are trying to come together against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), but nothing concrete has happened yet,” he said.Pawar slammed the Narendra Modi government for the 127th constitutional amendment saying it was just hogwash and the Centre has cheated people in the guise of giving powers to state to give reservation to backward classes. “Ninety percent of the states have crossed the limit of 50% in reservation imposed by 1992-SC ruling in Indra Sawhney case. All the states are facing the difficulty of maintaining the reservations given to the backward classes. Instead of doing away with the ceiling on the percentage of reservation, the Centre brought the amendment to give powers to the states. It is not going help any of the states, including Maharashtra, due to ceiling on the reservation. Had Centre’s intend been to give reservation to communities such as the Marathas, it should have done away with the ceiling in the same constitutional amendment,” Pawar said.He also stated that there was a need to build consensus to build pressure on the Centre for the constitutional amendment to remove the cap of 50%. “Even many leaders from NDA (National Democratic Alliance) want caste-based census and the empirical data to be released as it’s necessary for reservation to backward classes. Union minister Anupriya Patel said this in the Parliament. I am sure more leaders will start pushing for it. The Modi government is scared to release the data as it does not want the real picture on the backwardness of people to come to fore,” he said.Reacting to Pawar’s remarks related to the 127th amendment, Maharashtra BJP said that he was misleading the people to cover up the state government’s failure to protect the Maratha reservation. The party said that they will organise meetings to expose NCP on its “attempts to spread lies”. “Pawar has been batting for the removal of the 50% cap on reservations. Our question is why did he not try for it during his tenure as Union minister even after the Nachiappan Committee report in 2005. Maratha reservation was struck down after raising questions over the Gaikwad Commission report, which was on the backwardness of the Maratha community. This means even if the ceiling is removed, it would be difficult to restore the Maratha reservation unless a new report is prepared by the backward commission. The state government is doing nothing for it,” said Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil, adding that his party leaders were ready to openly debate on the reasons over which the Maratha reservation was struck down by SC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sharad-pawar-wants-congress-leaders-on-pegasus-probe-committee-101629141630749.html
17-08-2021||Pune||Parents and schools unhappy over state GR on fee reduction||After the State Government issued notification on Thursday reducing 15 per cent fees in schools for academic year 2021-2022, many parents and activists have expressed unhappiness regarding the same. At the same time, private school association are also unhappy with the decision and intend to object it in the court of law.Mukund Kirdat, education activist and spokesperson of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Pune unit said that the Maharashtra government should have given a 50 per cent concession after considering the savings and profitability of schools in Maharashtra.“Maharashtra English School Trustee Association (MESTA), the school association, had already announced a 25 per cent discount on its own. The government also reduced the amount by 50 percent while giving RTE refunds, citing the reduction in expenditure.” said Kirdat.Various schools have also expressed displeasure about the order stating that the fee reduction will again affect schools who are struggling financially due to the pandemic. Rajendra Singh, president of Federation of School Association of Maharashtra, said the order is not legally binding and has not considered the interest of schools which haven’t received fee from last two years.“Fee reduction is not legal and does not follow the fee regulation act of Maharashtra. The order also does not consider the schools which have not received payments from the last two years. The order also does not consider education as its prime goal. It also does not have a legal stand and hence we will be objecting the order in the High Court,” said Singh.Deputy director of education, Audumbar Ukirde said that there are multiple ways in which the concession in fee will be granted.“We will be issuing a detailed order by August 17 for each school in Pune division regarding how the fee concession is to be carried out. Under this order, all schools are expected to implement fee reduction for this academic year,” said Ukirde.According to the order, school management will have to either adjust the excess fee for the next month or quarter for those parents who have already paid the full fee for this year. The school management can take a call about refunding the fee or adjusting the academic fee, said the GR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/parents-and-schools-unhappy-over-state-gr-on-fee-reduction-101629141627259.html
17-08-2021||Chandigarh||HC makes filing of cancellation reports time-bound; issues slew of directions||The Punjab and Haryana high court has come down heavily on prosecution agencies for dillydallying over the filing of cancellation and untraced reports in criminal cases. Now, the high court has made the disposal process time-bound for investigators as well as courts. “The legitimate expectation that cancellation/untraced reports will be filed by the police and disposed of by the courts/magistrates without any undue delay is frustrated not by any shortage of infrastructure or men power but by causes attributable to apathy, neglect, lack of coordination and proper management, and giving of due attention with requisite determination of serving the cause of justice for all. The cause of justice suffers by delay in filing of cancellation/untraced reports by the police and disposal of the same by courts/magistrates,” the bench of justice Arun Kumar Tyagi observed, issuing a slew of directions to police and judicial officers. The directions came in a criminal case registered in 2016, where proceedings were held up even as the cancellation report had been filed, but the complainant party had gone abroad.

The complete industrial town is divided into eight zones.The PCMC issued a public notice which stated that crowded areas in the city have been witnessing irregular traffic in places such as vegetable-, grocery- and clothes- markets. Along with two-wheelers, standing auto rickshaws, too, are causing big problems. Due to irregular traffic, ambulances and the fire brigade are also facing parking issues. The same goes with residents and customers who come for shopping but cannot find space to park their vehicles. The public notice says that under Article 253 (A) 1 of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act 1949 which permits the civic chief to bring out an order for the regularisation of traffic, space will be allocated to 925 auto rickshaw stands beginning August 13 for the regularisation of traffic.Welcoming the decision, Baba Kamble, president, Maharashtra Auto Panchayat, said, “This is a very good move. Earlier, we had 500 auto rickshaws in Pimpri and Chinchwad but now we have a total 20,000 auto rickshaws so this will regularise the traffic.”Ayub Shaikh, an auto driver, said, “We too don’t want to impede traffic. The PCMC civic body has taken a wise decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pimprichinchwad-to-get-925-autorickshaw-stands-101629141507134.html
17-08-2021||Mumbai||Senior citizens’ tribunal can’t outright evict children, relatives: Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC) has held that the Tribunal for Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens cannot outrightly order the eviction of children and other relatives from common residence without first determining a competing set of claims as regards ownership rights in the residential premises.The division bench of justice Ujjal Bhuyan and justice Madhav Jamdar said in S Vanitha’s case, the Supreme Court (SC) has taken the view that the Senior Citizens Tribunal may have the authority to order an eviction if it is necessary and expedient to ensure maintenance and protection of the senior citizen or parent.“Eviction, in other words, would be incidental to the enforcement of the right to maintenance and protection,” said the bench. “However, this relief can be granted only after adverting to the competing claims in the dispute.”The court was hearing the petition filed by a Malabar Hill resident challenging December 15, 2020 order passed by the Mumbai City Senior Citizen Tribunal ordering her, her husband to vacate their residence on Gibbs Road along with their minor daughter.The order had come on a complaint filed by the petitioner’s widowed mother-in-law in April 2019, complaining of ill-treatment and torture at the hands of her son and daughter-in-law, which had forced her to leave the Gibbs Road residence.The petitioner woman, on the other hand, claimed before HC that her husband was suffering from mental illness and was unable to earn anything and that she alone had to maintain him and her daughter. Apart from refuting the allegations, the petitioner claimed that her mother-in-law intended to dispose of the Gibbs Road flat and therefore wanted them to vacate the premises.It was also argued on behalf of the petitioner that the Tribunal did not take into consideration her husband’s 20℅ shares in the flat and her right to reside in the shared household, under provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence (DV) Act, 2005.HC accepted her contentions and struck down the Tribunal order and remanded the matter back for fresh adjudication. The court said it was essential for the Tribunal to first arrive at a conclusion, as to whether the flat in question was an ancestral property or exclusively owned by the mother-in-law.“Though the procedure contemplated under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 is summary in nature nonetheless the Tribunal is required to find out as to whether the flat in question belongs exclusively to respondent No. 1 (mother-in-law) or it is an ancestral property where the petitioner also has a right to ownership and/or residence through her husband,” court said.HC felt that the tribunal was also required to deal with the contention of the petitioner woman that the flat in question is her shared household wherefrom she cannot be evicted. “It is in the backdrop of the above that the claims of the contesting parties would have to be decided which unfortunately does not appear to be the case in the instant proceeding.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/senior-citizens-tribunal-can-t-outright-evict-children-relatives-bombay-hc-101629141387728.html
17-08-2021||Chandigarh||Pay panel report: Punjab govt to decide on rectification in next cabinet meeting||On the sidelines of Monday’s cabinet meeting, Punjab ministers raised concerns over mass strike by the employees of various state government departments, seeking rectification in the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations. It was resolved that by the next cabinet meeting, the state government will take a decision on the issue and come out with a plan. Top officials of the state finance department, who were also part of the meeting, gave a presentation about financial load on the state exchequer on its implementation. “The finance department says even it 15% hike is given, it will put additional burden of ₹1,500-2,000 crore on the state exchequer in the form of salary and pension bill. We have asked the government to resolve the issues with the employees as state elections are scheduled early next year. Employees are protesting against the government and the trend could cost our party dear,” said a minister requesting anonymity. A three-member sub-committee led by local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra is holding talks with the employees for a resolution. Finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal and education minister Vijay Inder Singla are also part of the committee. Reportedly, all the ministers raised their concerns over the current situation. The state government facing an acute financial crunch and is not in a position to go as per the demand of employees. During a meeting last week, the sub-committee offered a hike of 15% over Fifth Pay Commission recommendations to the employees. But the employees demanded arrears to the tune of 28% and a hike of 20%. The sub-committee gave a fact sheet to the employee union leaders that salaries in state are already higher than most of the states and the central government. Going by the employees demand, the finance department says the state had to bear an additional load of ₹4,000 crore over and above the annual salary and pension bill of ₹27,000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pay-panel-report-punjab-govt-to-decide-on-rectification-in-next-cabinet-meeting-101629141328492.html

The service road along the Katraj-Navale bridge chowk stretch is coming up at a snail’s pace with plenty of bottlenecks such as mud, huge rocks and construction material posing a risk to people’s lives.Sumedh Vanarase who stays near the Navale bridge chowk said, “The bypass highway near the Navale bridge chowk towards Katraj is in a terrible condition and affects the daily commute of thousands of citizens. I travel daily along the bypass highway and many a time, we have to slow down the vehicle as service road construction material comes in the way.”Another resident Priyanka Khente said, “The service road work is going on very slowly and there is no other alternative road through the bypass highway. Many a time, vehicles come in opposite directions causing more traffic jams during peak hours. There are always bottlenecks at a couple of spots and we have to wait for long till the jam clears.”Atul Namekar, secretary of the Sinhagad road- Warje residents’ association, said, “This bypass highway is a major road which connects several parts of Pune and the Pimpri-Chinchwad area. Hence, there is round-the-clock traffic movement along this bypass road. Earlier too, there have been many fatal accidents due to construction and repair works underway. There needs to be a permanent solution, and service road work should be completed fast with proper safety measures.”Meanwhile, public works department (PWD) executive engineer Dhananjay Deshpande said, “The work on the service road of the bypass highway is going on in full swing and we will complete it soon.”The Katraj-Dehu road bypass highway was opened in 1989 especially to facilitate the movement of heavy vehicles from outside the city limits. So, trucks and trolleys headed towards Mumbai and Gujarat from Bangalore and Kolhapur pass through this bypass highway. Along its 40km stretch though, it connects to several residential parts of the city starting from Katraj, Sinhagad road, Warje, Kothrud, Baner, Balewadi, Hinjewadi, Chinchwad and Dehu road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/katrajdehu-road-bypass-highway-work-going-on-at-snail-s-pace-citizens-furious-101629141208627.html
17-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra defers decision on restart of schools; Mumbai sees a dip in cases||The state government on Monday deferred its decision on reopening schools. After earlier announcing that schools will restart from today, the government had a rethink on whether to resume physical classes for students between classes five and eight in rural areas and for classes eight to 12 in urban areas, owing to opposition from the Covid-19 task forces. Officials are not in favour of a restart as the under-18 population is not yet vaccinated.State chief secretary Sitaram Kunte said, “The decision [on the reopening of schools] has been deferred. We will review the situation in the coming days and decide on it.” Education minister Varsha Gaikwad had earlier announced that schools will reopen from August 17. Later, a detailed SOP was issued. However, in view of opposition from a few cabinet ministers and the task forces, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray convened a meeting of education and health department officials on August 11 to discuss the opening of schools and junior colleges.Meanwhile, Mumbai on Monday recorded a significant decrease in the number of new Covid-19 cases after it dropped to less than 200 (195 fresh infections). Also, the state insisted that employees as well as visitors to malls need to be fully vaccinated, barring those below 18 years of age as they are not vaccinated yet. The state has issued a circular that both mall customers as well as staff must be fully vaccinated. However, there was no such order for restaurants and shopkeepers, who have been protesting against the compulsory two-doses requirement, saying that they will not be able to function.The Monday circular on malls, however, clarified that those citizens below 18 years would be allowed in malls upon showing proof of their age.“I will not be able to operate any outlet in the malls as most employees are not yet fully vaccinated. Most of my staff have just taken a single dose and very few have both the doses,” rued Aji Nair, COO – food and beverages division, Mirah Hospitality, which runs 10 hotels in Mumbai and has five outlets in malls. “Apart from the staff, even the mandate for two doses for customers will hurt business,” he added.Maharashtra on Monday recorded 4,145 new cases and 100 deaths. There were 152,165 tests done on Monday, while the number of recoveries clocked 5,811. There are currently 62,452 active patients across the state, of which Pune tops with 14,610 patients, followed by Thane with 6,938 and Satara with 6,909.There were 625,414 vaccine doses administered on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-defers-decision-on-restart-of-schools-mumbai-sees-a-dip-in-cases-101629141207967.html
17-08-2021||Chandigarh||Sidhu appoints Capt-baiter Pargat as Punjab Cong general secretary||Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu on Monday appointed Jalandhar Cantonment MLA Pargat Singh as PPCC general secretary, organisation. “With the approval of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary, organisation, KC Venugopal and Punjab Congress in-charge Harish Rawat, I hereby appoint Pargat Singh as the PPCC (Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee) general secretary, organisation, with immediate effect,” Sidhu tweeted. Considered close to Sidhu, Pargat Singh, a two-time MLA, has been critical of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh for the past more than two years, raising questioning the state government’s failure to fulfil key poll promises in the 2017 assembly elections. His appointment came on a day Jagbir Brar, a senior party leader and former MLA from Jalandhar Cantonment that Pargat represents in the state assembly now, left the Congress to rejoin the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). Brar has been named by the SAD as its candidate from the seat in next year’s assembly polls, which the party is contesting in alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). A former India hockey captain, Pargat had won the 2012 assembly elections from Jalandhar Cantonment on a Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) ticket. He joined the Congress with Sidhu’s wife Navjot Kaur, then a BJP MLA, in November 2016 ahead of the state elections. Sidhu had also joined the party a few days later. Last week, Sidhu, who took charge as the state Congress chief on July 23, appointed Lok Sabha member Dr Amar Singh, retired IPS officer Mohammad Mustafa, Dr Pyare Lal Garg and Malwinder Singh Mali as his advisers to seek their “wise counsel” on party affairs. While Mustafa declined the role, Mali got into a controversy for his strident comments on social media against Capt Amarinder Singh and the Hindu community with several party leaders disapproving of his statements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-appoints-capt-baiter-pargat-as-punjab-cong-general-secretary-101629141087708.html

17-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai crosses rain target despite deficit in August||As of 8.30am on Monday morning, Mumbai had recorded a total of 2,218mm of rainfall this monsoon season (since June 1). This exceeds the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) forecast of normal rainfall of 2,205mm, with six weeks of the monsoon still to go. The monsoon in Mumbai this year has been marked by alternating phases of heavy and widespread rainfall, interspersed with long, subdued dry spells, as opposed to the rainfall uniformly spread out over the season. Between July 16 and 19, for instance, the city saw two back to back high-rainfall events that killed over 30 people and dumped a whopping 30% of the total seasonal rainfall over Mumbai in just three days. The previous month, Mumbai got 43.6% of June’s average rain in just nine hours. This pattern, experts, officials, and even the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on climate change warn, bears not only a climate change signature but is likely to get pronounced in coming years. Officials also cautioned that the chances of heavy rains in Mumbai will increase within the next 48 hours, and IMD has placed the city under a ‘yellow’ category storm alert for Wednesday, indicating that heavy rainfall in isolated locations is “very likely”. However, Mumbai’s rainfall deficit for the month of August so far stands at minus 59%, with just 134.2mm of rain being recorded at IMD’s observatory in Santacruz, as opposed to the normal rainfall of 330mm. Officials said that rains over the next few days are unlikely to make up for the deficit in Mumbai and the rest of the Konkan coast. Parts of Marathwada and Vidarbha – where eight districts are still seeing below normal rains this season – will benefit significantly more than parts of the Konkan during the next few days rains, according to officials and independent experts, who attributed the rains to the formation of a monsoon low pressure system over the Bay of Bengal, which typically strengthens the influence of rain bearing westerly winds. “IMD has issued heavy rainfall warnings for Maharashtra for the coming three days, especially for Marathwada. It will be good for farmers in that region and around, who are waiting for a good spell of rain for their crops,” KS Hosalikar, head of IMD’s surface instrument division in Pune, said. “On August 17, most of Vidarbha, Parbhani, Hingoli, Jalna, Nanded, Aurangabad, Jalgaon, Dhule, Nashik and Nandurbar districts will receive light to moderate rain, which is expected to continue on 18 August, except for regions in east Vidarbha,” Tweeted Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, England. “This low-pressure system is not expected to benefit Mumbai, Konkan, Pune district, most of Madhya Maharashtra and southern Marathwada. From 19 August, rainfall activities in many parts of Maharashtra will once again decrease substantially until the month end,” Deoras added, explaining that the monsoon as a whole remains subdued over the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-crosses-rain-target-despite-deficit-in-august-101629140909757.html
17-08-2021||Pune||With new Bengal tiger couple, Katraj zoo’s pride touches 8||PUNE: Following some relaxation in covid norms, the plan to get two Bengal tigers to the Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park and Wildlife Research Centre at Katraj which was pending since the last few months, has finally seen the light of day with the duo namely Bhakti and Arjun being transported from Aurangabad to the Katraj zoo on Saturday. With this, the total count of tigers at the zoo has gone up to eight, including four tigers and four tigresses. Of the four tigresses, one is a white tigress.The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has got the pair of big cats from the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation-run Siddharth Zoo in exchange for two Nilgai (Boselahus tragocamelus). Siddharth Zoo currently has 14 tigers, including five cubs.Rajkumar Jadhav, director, Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park and Wildlife Research Centre, said, “We have got the pair of tigers from the Aurangabad zoo under the exchange programme. Bhakti, 5, and Arjun, 7, have been quarantined as part of our protocol.”Dyneshwar Molak, additional muncipal commissioner, said, “Due to the covid-19 pandemic, the plan to get the tigers was pending for a few months now. Finally, they have arrived here.”Unlike gardens in the city however, the Katraj zoo hasn’t still been opened by the PMC in the absence of permission from the Central Zoo Authority and the state government. “The pair of tigers will help us in the process of mating with our existing tigers as we want tigers of a different bloodline. At present, we have six tigers including three male, of which two are old. We have a capacity to keep 10 tigers in the zoo. The normal quarantine period of the animal is 21 days. We are keeping the new pair separately from the existing tiger cages. After the quarantine period is over, we will get them to mix with the other tigers,” said Jadhav.The Katraj zoo is spread across 130 acre and is divided into three areas namely, an animal orphanage, a snake park and a zoo overlooking a lake spanning 42 acre. The zoo houses a total 440 animals and gets financial aid from the Central Zoo Authority. The zoo is planned so as to offer a natural habitat to 16 animal species with indigenous natural enclosures created for tigers, white tigers, monkeys, sambar, bears, leopards and an assortment of wild cats, sloth, barking deer, black bucks, crocodiles and the Indian tortoise. At least 2,500 to 3,000 people visit the zoo daily with the number reaching 10,000 to 15,000 people on weekends and holidays. A member of the ISIS (International Species Information System) and a non-profit organisation, the Katraj zoo shares a world-class zoological data collection and software with more than 800 member- zoos, aquariums and related organisations across 80 countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/with-new-bengal-tiger-couple-katraj-zoo-s-pride-touches-8-101629140908302.html
17-08-2021||Lucknow||UP health dept to hire 900 more doctors on contract, pay more for serving in remote districts||The Uttar Pradesh health department has started the process to deploy 900 more doctors on contractual posts for a year to strengthen medical care in view of the possible third wave of Covid-19.“We have received applications from 1500 doctors and interviews have begun to select the best ones from among them for our hospitals across the state,” said Dr Kalpana Singh, director general training who also holds charge of director general medical health.The officials in the health department said they plan to finish interviews by September 1 and, thereafter, the appointment letters will be issued in the first week of September.“Being contractual jobs, the selected doctors will be given the option to work in their home district if there are vacancies,” said a senior health official.“Our focus as well as the vacancies are more in the district hospitals and community health centres in the periphery (remote) districts such as Chitrakoot, Deoria, Banda, Balrampur, Shamli and Hamirpur, where the number of doctors is less. So, doctors joining in these districts, will get more salary compared to metro cities,” said the official.“Increasing the number of doctors in periphery districts will ensure patients do not have to rush to the state capital for treatment. This eventually will reduce the load on health facilities in King George’s Medical University in Lucknow or the Medical College in Prayagraj,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general association of international doctors.The state has less than 14,000 government doctors working on permanent posts in 157 hospitals, 855 community health centres and about 3000 primary health centres, apart from other smaller health facilities. The sanctioned posts of government doctors in Uttar Pradesh is over 18,000.“We expected at least 500 applicants will be specialists, but we got 251 such applications. We hope a good number of them pass the screening and join service,” said Dr Singh.A specialist joining in a “periphery district” will get ₹1.10 lakh as salary per month while the same specialist joins service in a metro city, he or she will get about ₹80,000 as salary. Similarly, if an MBBS doctor joins service in a periphery district, he or she will get ₹60,000 per month and if they join in bigger cities, the pay could be ₹40,000 per month.According to officials, the posts being offered are contractual and hence those joining service will be allowed to work in their home district, which is not the case in permanent posts.“The appointment will, however, be for districts in the periphery or those far off from metros and doctors joining services in such districts will get more pay,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-health-dept-to-hire-900-more-doctors-on-contract-pay-more-for-serving-in-remote-districts-101629140907748.html

He said a screen will be put on the tower to show the air quality index (AQI) in real time.The tower has been built by Delhi-based Pious Air Private Limited without any cost to the administration. Five places were shortlisted before its location was finalised. “Vehicular emissions are a big source of pollution in the city. It was found that the highest volume of traffic is present at this intersection, so it was chosen,” Dalai said.Officials added this will be treated as a pilot project and If it brings a noticeable difference to the air quality, then the administration will consider setting up more such outdoor air purifiers.Two AQI monitoring stations in city so farThe CPCC also recently inaugurated the second continuous ambient air quality monitoring station (CAAQMS) in Sector 22. The AQI in Sector 22, as per the CAAQMS , is usually over 100, which is classified as moderate and causes breathing discomfort to people with lung and heart diseases and asthma. The AQI as per the one installed in Sector 25 has remained around 60-70, which is classified as satisfactory and causes minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people.The CPCC will be inaugurating a third CAAQMS in September in Sector 53, to check for emissions close to the Sector 43 Inter State Bus terminal (ISBT). The Central Pollution Control Board plans to install total five such monitoring stations in Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhair-purification-tower-coming-up-in-sector-26-101629140849619.html
17-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chaos marks second Ambala MC House meeting||The second House meeting of the Ambala municipal corporation on Monday concluded without any productive discussions amid constant disruptions. The meeting that took place after almost six months began at 9am and was marred by confrontation between BJP and Congress councillors. Guards had to be called as BJP members protested and called for the expulsion of Congress councillor Mithun Verma for allegedly “insulting women” after he had a face-off with the saffron party’s Monika Mal. Even as mayor Shakti Rani Sharma intervened and the House was set in order, it failed to discuss any of the nine new agendas and 90 additional agendas. The meeting was finally called off around 2pm as BJP’s Hitesh Jain complained of low sugar level due to a prolonged proceesings, a concern endorsed by his fellow party members. Later, talking to media, the mayor, who belongs to Haryana Jan Chetna Party, condemned such behaviour. Earlier, during the meeting, most councillors objected to the action taken report on agendas of the first meeting presented by an executive officer. The members, mostly from the mayor’s party, also demanded action against an executive engineer for no progress on proposals passed by the House in the previous meeting that was held in February. MC commissioner Dhirendra Khadgata gave the officials two-week ultimatum to take up the pending proposals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chaos-marks-second-ambala-mc-house-meeting-101629140790277.html
17-08-2021||Pune||Measles-rubella suspected cases: Pune City records 74 expected negative, 9 negative cases||Pune: The central government had instructed state governments to increase surveys to detect more cases of measles and rubella as the former has redefined the suspected cases to any age person who has fever and the signature red rashes mark, which was earlier restricted to only those aged under 15 years. This means more people could be monitored for fever and rashes. However, the state has pointed out that all districts and municipal corporations in Akola health division have poor reporting and must ramp up screening. Measles and rubella are contagious viral infection preventable by vaccine and best known by its distinctive red rashes. The disease can spread through direct contact with the saliva or mucus of an infected person or through the air by respiratory droplets produced from coughing or sneezing. Pune district has reported 49 expected negative cases in rural PCMC, 110 in Pune rural and 74 in Pune city and has reported 3, 4 and 9 negative cases respectively. Dr Abhay Tidke, district surveillance officer said, “The higher the expected cases indicates that the surveillance is stronger. The expected number is given based on population estimates for 2021. While earlier only those under 15 years of age were surveyed for measles and rubella symptoms, now this had been redefined to include those above 15 as well which means more number of people would be surveyed. Pune district has performed much better just second in line after Mumbai with expected count at 260 negative cases and 78 confirmed negative cases in the last seven months.” In a letter to the authorities in Akola division and the municipal corporation, deputy director Dr Rajkumar Chauhan wrote to the health officials stating, “Indian government has changed the definition of suspected rubella and measles patients as to anyone who has fever and rashes. Anyone found with such symptoms has to be monitored and samples must be sent for testing in a laboratory. The negative samples must be informed to the government.” He wrote that the fact that the survey is going aptly could be defined for every two negative cases for every one lakh population. “From the data received between January 1 and July 31, it is found that Akola division has a very poor reporting of cases. The areas underperforming are Akola, Akola municipal corporation, Amravati, Amaravati municipal corporation, Wardha, Washim and Yavatamal where the expected non-rubella, non-measles (negative) cases per year are much lower than the population estimates in these regions.” Pune district has reported 49 expected negative cases in rural PCMC, 110 in Pune rural and 74 in Pune city and has reported cases 3, 4 and 9 negative cases respectively. Dr Abhay Tidke, district surveillance officer said, “The higher the expected cases indicates that the surveillance is stronger. The expected number is given based on population estimates for 2021. While earlier only those under 15 years of age were surveyed for measles and rubella symptoms, now this had been redefined to include those above 15 as well which means more number of people would be surveyed.” Pune district has performed much better just second in line after Mumbai with expected count at 260 negative cases and 78 confirmed negative cases in the last seven months, according to a state health report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/measlesrubella-suspected-cases-pune-city-records-74-expected-negative-9-negative-cases-101629140727014.html
17-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Soon, register vehicle theft FIR through mobile app||Soon, residents will be able to lodge FIRs about stolen vehicles through a mobile application without having to visit the police station.The UT administrator, VP Singh Badnore, in his speech on August 15, announced that the Chandigarh Police was in the process of developing a mobile app for registration and investigation of e-FIRs for motor vehicle theft. Sources within the police force said that on an average, 5-6 vehicles were stolen in the city everyday, but because the complainants were required to visit the police station, FIRs would many times get delayed.With the new app, however, complaints can be lodged anytime from anywhere. As per protocol, soon after a complaint is lodged, the investigating officer will visit the complainant once.Superintendent of police (SP, city) Ketan Bansal said, “The residents will also be able to check the status of their complaints. After a stipulated period of 30 days, if the vehicle is not found, an untraced report will be updated on the app, which the complainant can use for insurance claim.”Sources said the police department was now coordinating with the judiciary for integration and once that was done, the app would be launched.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhsoon-register-vehicle-theft-fir-through-mobile-app-101629140667762.html
17-08-2021||Mumbai||Jan Ashirwad Yatra: 4 Maharashtra mins join BJP’s nationwide rally||Four union ministers from Maharashtra joined the Bharatiya Janata Party’s nation-wide Jan Ashirwad Yatra across 22 states, which began on Monday. Ahead of the forthcoming local body elections, the Maharashtra unit of the party is looking at it as an opportunity to take the central schemes to people and “expose” the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray, over its “failures on various fronts”. Elections to 22 municipal corporations, 24 district councils and several tehsil level bodies in Maharashtra are due in the next six months. With more than two-third local bodies gearing up for the polls, which are considered to be the mini assembly polls, the power battle in Maharashtra is expected to heat up in the next few months. The BJP is facing a staunch political opposition after three parties – the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress – joined hands against it in 2019 to form the government. The ruling parties are likely to pose a strong challenge before the BJP, which controls the highest number of local bodies in urban as well rural parts. Of the 36 new faces inducted in the Modi government as part of cabinet reshuffle on July 7, four were from Maharashtra. Besides former Maharashtra chief minister Narayan Rane, who was inducted as MSME minister, Rajya Sabha MP Dr Bhagwat Karad and MPs Kapil Patil and Dr Bharti Pawar were inducted as ministers of state. The ministers of state began their yatra on Monday, while Rane will join on August 19 as per the programme chalked out by party’s central leadership. Dr Karad, minister of state for finance, kicked off his yatra by visiting Vaidyanath temple in Parli in Beed, followed by the flagging of the yatra at Gopinath Gad in the presence of party’s national secretary Pankaja Munde. The presence of Munde is assumed to be significant, as Mundes were said to be upset about PM Narendra Modi’s decision of picking Karad over Pritam Munde, Beed MP and Pankaja’s younger sister, in the cabinet. Karad is seen as a prominent OBC leader. The discontent among the Munde supporters was witnessed during the inaugural function of the yatra. Pankaja’s supporters raised slogans praising her, indirectly indicating that they do not accept any other (Karad’s) leadership. Munde had to intervene and stopped them from doing so. Karad will visit six districts of Marathwada during his yatra till August 21. Kapil Patil, minister of state for Panchayati Raj, is scheduled to hold meetings, get-togethers with party workers and visit Covid centres in parts of Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli, Navi Mumbai and rural parts, including Shahad, Titwala of the districts by concluding in Bhiwandi city. Party MLAs and former ministers, including Sanjay Kelkar, Ravindra Chavan, Niranjan Davkhare, are accompanying him. Dr Bharti Pawar, union minister of state for public health and a tribal leader, has been asked to focus on the tribal-dominated areas of Palghar and Nashik. Dr Pawar took a dig at the state over poor health care services in Palghar. “The Central government released ₹70 crore and number of ventilators for Maharashtra, but it is surprising not a single equipment has reached Palghar. The Centre gave ₹23,000 crore to various states to fight against Covid-19 pandemic. We are taking stock of the implementation of the central schemes in the state, but the approach of the state machinery is indifferent,” she said, during the yatra. Rane, who is considered an ardent critic of the Shiv Sena and its leadership, will begin his yatra in Mumbai on August 19 and conclude it in Sindhudurg on August 26. After first two days in Mumbai, Rane will visit, Vasai-Virar on Saturday and parts of Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg. According to a senior BJP leader, the yatra could be an opportunity to strengthen the base in the districts these ministers are travelling in, keeping the local body elections in mind. “Rane will visit parts of Konkan, while Kapil Patil is in Thane where we are eyeing the corporation and district council elections. Similarly, key Marathwada leaders, including Pankaja, of the party are participating in the yatra,” said a Marathwada leader, requesting anonymity. Maharashtra BJP’s vice-president Madhav Bhandari said the main focus of the yatra was to take the Central government’s programmes and schemes to common man. “The yatra is an outreach programme to take the Centre’s schemes to the people. We will not talk about the state government’s functioning or its failures,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/jan-ashirwad-yatra-4-maharashtra-mins-join-bjp-s-nationwide-rally-101629140550070.html

17-08-2021||Mumbai||53% parents want schools to reopen, staff vaccinated: Survey||Several states in the country, including Maharashtra, recently decided to reopen schools. While parents and students are still anxious about this move, a survey of over 24,000 parents from around the country has highlighted how 53% of participating parents are willing to send their children to school. The survey also reveals that 74% of these parents feel that local administration should ensure the staff and teachers are vaccinated and rapid antigen test kits are made available at schools.“In states where schools have opened in the last 30 days, the response has been mixed. In many private schools, physical attendance has been 50% at best. New Covid cases have been reported from Gujarat, Chhattisgarh and Haryana, which has some parents worried,” said a report made public by LocalCircles, a community social media platform enabling citizens and small businesses to escalate issues for policy enforcement and interventions. The survey received over 47,000 responses from 24,000 parents residing in 378 districts of India. “While 53% parents are in favour of re-opening of schools in August-September, 44% respondents also still maintain that schools should be conducted online until Covid cases are down to zero. Parents who are unwilling to send children to school for in-person classes cite the risk of festivals (Rakhshabandhan, Onam, Ganesh Chaturthi, etc) which could lead to a rise in Covid cases,” adds the survey report.State school education minister Varsha Gaikwad on August announced that offline classes will restart for batches 5 to 8 in rural areas and batches 8 to 12 in urban cities following Covid-19 protocols starting August 17. This, however, is not the first time that such a move has been implemented by the state government. In November last year, the school education department had released a similar circular announcing the reopening of schools for Classes 9 to 12 in a phased manner. By January 2021, another circular was released directing students from Classes 5 to 8 to be brought back to school in groups, and maintain Covid appropriate behaviour on campus. Both these circulars, however, were revoked once Covid cases started rising again and the state government called for another complete lockdown starting mid-April.Parent groups have been actively opposing the idea of physical classes, especially in cities where Covid-19 numbers are still being recorded. “International schools work with 40-50 students in one batch, whereas state board schools have anywhere between 60-70 students per division and in some cases, each grade has three to five divisions. Even if schools divide their batches into smaller groups and spread them across different classrooms, how will the teacher manage to teach all students?” asked Arundhati Chavan, president of Parent-Teachers Association United Forum. She added that before announcing a blanket decision, the state government should first try pilot batches and understand how physical schools could pose difficulties to schools as well as students. “Who will be responsible if one or more students contracts the virus? The state government has taken this decision on an impulse without even discussing the same with school-heads,” she added.Previously, LocalCircles had also conducted another survey of 19,000 parents where 76% of respondents said they are not ready to send their children to school unless Covid-19 cases in their districts go down to zero, or all children are vaccinated first. In the same survey, over 65% of respondents had also approved that their children receive the Covid vaccine if it is made available by September 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/53-parents-want-schools-to-reopen-staff-vaccinated-survey-101629140490962.html

17-08-2021||Pune||Shop timings in Pune rural areas extended till 10 pm||Pune: After the urban parts, Covid relaxations have been announced in rural areas of Pune district. Rajesh Deshmukh, Pune district collector, issued an order on Sunday stating that the relaxations, of shop timings extended till 10 pm, announced by the state government on August 11 would be applicable to rural parts, including gram panchayats and municipal councils. It is the first set of official relaxations in rural parts from Covid-induced curbs during the second wave. As the positivity rate in rural areas was higher than Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), curbs were not eased in rural areas. “The relaxation guidelines by the state government are applicable to rural areas from August 16. This order will be in effect until further orders,” stated Deshmukh. Since last few weeks, rural parts recorded a declining trend in positivity rate. During the week August 9 to August 14, it recorded the lowest positivity rate during the second wave at 3.95%. For the same duration, PMC recorded positivity rate at 2.5% and PCMC recorded 3.5%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/shop-timings-in-pune-rural-areas-extended-till-10-pm-101629140428197.html
17-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Mother and child care centre project delayed||It has genesis in the Chandigarh Master Plan and its architectural plans are in place since 2018, but still the new mother and child care centre to come up at Government Multi-Specialty Hospital in Sector 16 (GMSH-16) has failed to see the light of day.In his Independence Day speech, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore had assured, “We will have a mother and child care centre in GMSH-16 soon.” But the reality is, the proposed project is still restricted to the planning board.“The project and the plot for it, approved in the Chandigarh Master Plan, remains in the planning stage even though the urban planning department had finalised the first draft in 2018. The plan was also submitted with the UT health department, but since then little progress has been made,” said a senior UT official, requesting anonymity.Tallest building on premisesThe 404-bed state-of-the-art centre is planned to come up in the existing building that houses the gynaecology and paediatric facilities. The project entails a seven-storey building, which will be the tallest in the hospital compound.“As per the plans, the building will be ground plus six storeys with two basements. The total covered area on the ground floor will be around 30,000 sq ft. The total covered area will be 5.42 lakh sq ft. It will be a green building. There would be a number of operating rooms, labour rooms, and other related facilities,” said the official.Why the delayThe project was first delayed because there were some issues between the gynaecology and paediatric departments. “As the existing building has to be demolished, there was a question as to where to shift the operational departments from the site. It was decided that these would be shifted to Sector 22. But then came the pandemic and some facilities that are to be demolished are currently being used for Covid management,” said the official.No feasibility study has been done so far and the cost estimates are yet to be finalised, and another obstacle is likely to hit the project delaying it further: “As per rough cost estimates, the project is likely to cost more than ₹100 crore. This would necessitate approval of the Union government, which generally takes a long time,” said the official.There have been several meetings on the subject between the health and the urban planning departments, but the final nod on the plan hasn’t come through. “The plans are still fluid. The health department is unclear about the details of their requirement. There are issues like requirement of beds, number of operation theatres, labour rooms, patient wards and other related wings,” said the official.Another similar project hanging fireAnother mother and child care centre, planned to come up at Government Medical College and Hospital in Sector 32, is also languishing at the planning stage. This is the case, even though it was conceptualised long back, approved in 2019 and ₹38 crore allocated for it.The 334-bed centre will come up in the K block area of the hospital. As per the architectural plan approved, it will spread over 1.11 sq ft area having seven floors plus basement. The administrator in his I-Day speech had also assured that this would also come up “soon”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhmother-and-child-care-centre-project-delayed-101629140427651.html

These include cycles being given to 1,994 ineligible beneficiaries. HT has a copy of the deputy secretary’s letter dated August 3.The matter came to light when the state labour department raised concern over irregularities that the state Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) highlighted in its audit report for 2017-18. According to the CAG, financial assistance of lakhs of rupees were given to around 135 children of registered workers for education in the same class in different years, violating the provisions of the stipend scheme. “Besides, the Moga labour department has also given the benefit of this scheme to nine children of workers, who had not met the requirement of minimum 90-day of construction work over the past year,” the CAG report adds. Under the stipend scheme, children of registered workers are entitled to get financial assistance between ₹3,000 and ₹80,000 depending on class or education type. Likewise, cycles were distributed to 1,994 students of Classes 9 and 10, without ensuring that their parents had completed the key requirement of minimum 90-day construction work, the CAG report adds. The cycle scheme was launched in 2014, but is now discontinued. CAG had also pointed out that the district labour department had given ₹4 lakh to a beneficiary under the ex gratia scheme, who was covered under then Bhagat Puran Singh Sehat Bima Yojna (BPSSBY). A labour department official said, “Under the stipend scheme, financial assistance can be given to students of every grade, from Class-1 to postgraduation level only once. Workers are also required to be engaged in construction work for a minimum 90 days over the last year to get benefit of any scheme of the BOCW.” Moga assistant labour commissioner Baljeet Singh said, “I have joined here just recently. We have submitted a reply to the department’s letter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aid-of-rs-4-lakh-for-labourers-given-to-ineligible-beneficiaries-in-moga-cag-101629140367755.html
17-08-2021||Chandigarh||Need-based changes: CHB considering more relaxations||Pressed by more than 65,000 allottees, Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) is once again considering to revise its policy for need-based changes in the dwelling units. Officials say more relaxations could be allowed in addition to those previously announced.“We will table the issue in the meeting of board of directors later this month to decide the future course of action,” said CHB chief executive officer Yashpal Garg, while not divulging any details.CHB residents’ welfare federation has been demanding implementation of the “Delhi model” for resolving the contentious issue that affects more than 4 lakh city residents.Earlier this year, in a letter to the federation, the board reiterated that it had already allowed need-based changes, and not more relaxations were being planned. The letter had come in response to a memorandum submitted by the federation to the UT administrator, who had then asked CHB officials to examine the issue of allowing one-time settlement policy as requested by the allottees. Delhi model v/s 2019 policyCHB in 2019 issued a policy allowing residents to regularise many of the unauthorised constructions in their flats. Originally, the regularisation policy was announced in 2017, but only 40 applications were received, even as the board’s survey last year revealed that 90% of its 65,000-odd dwelling units had massive structural violations.The nature of violations include excess construction within the dwelling unit, unauthorised floors and encroachments on public land.The 2019 policy is applicable only for additions or alterations within CHB dwelling units and not encroachments. In case violations are not removed, at the allottee’s own cost, allotment may be cancelled and possession resumed. CHB had also directed that a certificate of structural stability of the building has to be submitted. In its April 2021 order, the CHB stated action against additional constructions or alterations will be kept pending till December 21, 2021. However, the allottees who do not deposit the penal charge on the basis of self-certified area may be issued notices of demolition or cancellation thereafter.CHB allottees complain that the need-based changes allowed didn’t resolve their problems. The federation has been demanding that as per the Delhi Model, the covered area should be relaxed. “One-time charges should be taken for this coverage without regularising additional coverage, so that people could get relief. Charges could also be taken to regularise the construction on public land stipulating that the user will have no legal right over these projections,” said Nirmal Dutt, chairman of the federation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/needbased-changes-chb-considering-more-relaxations-101629140247690.html
17-08-2021||Mumbai||Ruling party must ensure new seeds of division are not sown: Shiv Sena||Days after Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi declared that August 14 would now be observed as ‘Partition Horrors Remembrance Day’, the Shiv Sena targeted the PM saying the ruling party must ensure that new seeds of division should not be sown. The Sena on Monday said that mere symbolism will not remove the pain of the Partition of India on August 14, 1947. In a stinging criticism, an editorial in Sena mouthpiece, Saamana, further said like the pain of partition, displacement of Kashmiri Pandits was equally painful, but they have not returned to the valley.It further added, “The pain of Partition will not go away by mere symbolism, but a definite action is needed... If displaced Kashmiri Pandits would have got their rights and homes in the Kashmir Valley, a lot could be achieved... Many Congress and Left leaders, who were involved in the freedom struggle and even staunch pro-Hindutva leader Veer Savarkar was in favour of a two-nation theory. So was Hindu Mahasabha. BJP and Jana Sangh hadn’t seen its dawn then.” The Sena, which shares power with the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in Maharashtra, through the editorial said only former prime minister Indira Gandhi managed to take “revenge” of the pain of partition by dividing Pakistan and destroying the “two-nation concept” on the basis on which Pakistan was formed. As a policy of Maharashtra BJP, its spokesperson said they do not comment on Saamana editorial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ruling-party-must-ensure-new-seeds-of-division-are-not-sown-shiv-sena-101629140194357.html

17-08-2021||Mumbai||Amid Afghanistan crisis, 2,200 students in India stare at an uncertain future||Over 2,200 students of Afghan-origin studying in India on scholarship stare at an uncertain future with the Taliban seizing control of Afghanistan that has forced thousands to either flee or seek evacuation from the country. The Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR), a nodal agency for international students that promotes cultural exchange with other countries by formulating and implementing policies and programmes, will take care of the Afghan students “as usual”, its top official told Hindustan Times on Monday. “The students who are currently in India on ICCR scholarship will be taken care of by ICCR as usual. They will receive their stipends on time and can reside in the hostels in their universities,” said Dinesh Patnaik, director general, ICCR. However, for those students whose scholarship is coming to an end with the close of the academic year, the ICCR did not have the mandate to help them extend their stay, Patnaik said. The ICCR has also been receiving requests from students in Afghanistan for expediting their visas to permit entry into India. “For students, whose scholarships will come to an end soon and wish to stay in India after finishing their course, the ICCR doesn’t have the mandate to decide on whether they can be allowed. Only upon direction from higher authorities can we process such requests for extension of student visa,” he said. “The scholarship offered to foreign students is made to the country they belong to. Now that the government has changed, we don’t know if the new administration will accept the offer. So the visas of students can’t be processed until there’s clarity from the new Afghanistan administration,” Patnaik added. External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said on Monday that there were a number of Afghans who have been India’s partners in the promotion of mutual developmental, educational and people-to-people endeavours and India will stand by them. The MEA has not issued any statement pertaining to students or visas as yet. Visas remain one of the biggest concerns of Afghan students in India, said Nasir Khuehami, the national spokesperson of the Jammu & Kashmir Students’ Association, who launched a helpline for distressed Afghan students in India. “The major problems that students are facing are related to hostel accommodation and visa because their visa tenure is about to expire in the coming months,” said Khuehami, who has been fielding hundreds of calls from students across India in the past week. A 27-year-old Afghan student pursuing his Masters in Public Administration in Chandigarh stayed back in India even as his friends left for Afghanistan earlier this year. “I completed my course a couple of months ago but decided to stay back for my results and degree. I was lucky,” said the student who hasn’t been able to contact his family in Kabul for a week. “The last time I spoke to my family, they were terrified. They said I should stay back in India for as long as possible,” said the student whose visa expires in January 2022. The ICCR, an autonomous agency under the Central government keeps details of students who are on scholarship in the country. “We are in the process of getting details of self-finance students from [various] universities. Our first priority is to take care of the students who are here in India already,” said Patnaik. “Ever since we’ve heard of the upheaval in Afghanistan, we have been trying to connect with our students who have been attending classes online. Sadly we only have their Indian phone numbers and with internet connection down in Afghanistan at present, there’s no way of contacting them,” said Sunil Patil, director of Student’s Welfare, University of Mumbai. According to information shared by the varsity, 42 students from Afghanistan had confirmed admissions in MU in 2019-20. However not a single student from the country has confirmed their admission in this academic session. “There are more than 2,000 students from Afghanistan in India and nearly 50% of them went back home once lockdown was implemented in India last year. Those still in India, are worried because many have not managed to reach out to their respective families. Even our student representative for students from Afghanistan is stuck in Kabul and we have no way of reaching out to him. Students are fearing for their own lives and the lives of their near and dear ones,” said Sanjay Nahar, founder of Sarhad, a Pune-based non-government organisation working with international students. In a stunning rout, the Taliban seized nearly all of Afghanistan in just over a week, despite the billions of dollars spent by the US and NATO over nearly two decades to build up Afghan security forces. Just days earlier, an American military assessment estimated it would be a month before the capital would come under insurgent pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amid-afghanistan-crisis-2-200-students-in-india-stare-at-an-uncertain-future-101629139707631.html
17-08-2021||Noida||Citing CPCB affidavit, Ghaziabad residents say it’ll take 94 years to clear waste at Ghazipur landfill||The Kaushambi Apartments Residents Welfare Association (Karwa) on Monday said that the bioremediation/biomining of the legacy waste at the Ghazipur landfill site is going on at a very slow pace and that the residential body will soon bring this fact to notice of the Supreme Court. Office bearers of the association claimed that it will take 94 years to clear the 140 lakh tonnes of waste from the site if the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) maintains its current pace of bioremediation work.Karwa moved the apex court in September last year over the issue of pollution from the landfill site, contending that it is one of the major sources of pollution affecting the residents. The association first filed a petition with the National Green Tribunal (NGT) over the issue in September 2015. Later, it moved the apex court in September last year and notices were issued to respondent agencies of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh in October last year. “In response to our petition, we recently received an affidavit filed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). They have stated that bioremediation work is going on at Ghazipur landfill, but only 1.5 lakh metric tonnes of waste has been bioremediated/biomined in the past one year out of 140 lakh tonnes of waste dumped at the site. We calculated that with this rate, it will take about 94 years to complete the entire process,” said VK Mittal, president of Karwa. He said that the affidavit was submitted before the apex court by CPCB in January and the association recently got an access to the affidavit. “We will now file a counter affidavit that the court must intervene at the lax rate of bioremediation/biomining at the landfill site. This will lead to polluted air surroundings with which residents of Kaushambi are already suffering and will also affect the groundwater of the area,” Mittal added. HT has a copy of the affidavit filed by the CPCB. “I will have to check the documents before making any comment over the issue,” said a senior officer from CPCB.A senior EDMC official, who did not wish to be named, said, “We cannot comment on the affidavit filed by another agency. However, greening efforts are being made to reduce the height of the landfill as well as process the waste.”The Karwa moved the Supreme Court with contention for stoppage of different sources of pollution affecting the township that has about 22 high-rises with an estimated population of about 20,000. Pollution levels are already high in Kaushambi due to its close proximity to Anand Vihar and Kaushambi inter-state bus terminals, Ghazipur landfill site and Sahibabad industrial area. The residential area is also affected by heavy vehicular traffic throughout the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/citing-cpcb-affidavit-ghaziabad-residents-say-it-ll-take-94-years-to-clear-waste-at-ghazipur-landfill-101629139286942.html

The action came after a video of the incident was shared on social media. It showed Manpreet sitting next to his friend, who could be seen firing in the air while driving a car in Mohali. The video was reportedly shot a couple of days back. The incident comes days after a Youth Akali Dal leader was shot dead in broad daylight in Mohali. Deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan has also marked a magisterial inquiry into the incident and said that “exemplary legal action” will be taken against the guilty. While the singer belongs to Hoshiarpur, his friend has been identified as Jagpreet Singh, aka Jaggi, of Sangrur. They have been booked under Sections 336 (any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life or the personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code besides under the Arms Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohalipunjabi-singer-friend-booked-for-firing-in-air-101629139235712.html
17-08-2021||Noida||Greater Noida: Recovery notice issued against builders over illegal advertisements||The Greater Noida Authority on Monday said that it has started issuing recovery notices against real estate developers and educational institutes that failed to pay the penalty imposed on them for putting up illegal boards, posters and unipoles across the city. The authority said putting up such advertisements on public spaces required its permission and came with a fee. “We have issued recovery notices against 70 agencies including the developers and educational institutions, which were found to be advertising without permission causing revenue loss. Now we will recover the lost revenue by selling their assets as per the rules,” said Salil Yadav, deputy general manager of the Greater Noida authority that has started the process.The official said the authority had issued the penalties against the violators since May 2018. The total penalties add up to around ₹3 crore, he added.“We had issued many notices, but the offenders failed to comply. The recovery notices will now enable the government to sell assets and recover revenue,” said Yadav.The authority had started acting against violators in 2018 following complaints from residents.“Illegal unipoles are not only an eyesore, but also a public safety risk. The authority must act sternly,” said Anita Prajapati, a resident of Gaur City, Greater Noida West.According to the advertisement policy, such hoardings are not allowed on roads less than 80 metres wide, on religious places, monuments, wetlands, forest reserves and bridges. It, however, does not specify the exact penalty or legal action to be taken against violators, but empowers the chief executive officer (CEO) to levy a penalty and remove such hoardings without notice. The CEO may even act against officials who fail to act against illegal hoardings.For advertisements on public land, a committee formed by the authority will first inspect the site for safety before giving its permit, followed by charging the applicable fees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-recovery-notice-issued-against-builders-over-illegal-advertisements-101629139234530.html

The fire department suspects that a short-circuit in an air-conditioner sparked it.Fire department officials said that they arrived at the scene at around 6.05am and the blaze was controlled in 20 minutes. Around 20 people, including those living on other floors, were rescued, they added.The department said Rudrakshi (12) and Kritika (9) were charred to death.Their father Dinesh Solanki (40) suffered serious burn injuries while mother Mamta Solanki (38) and four-year-old brother Shivay suffered minor burns. The injured were admitted to a private hospital in Noida where their condition is stable, police said.Ankur Agarwal, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said, “The police and fire department teams rushed to the spot after getting the information.”NK Singh, fire safety officer, Noida Phase 3, said three fire tenders were pressed into service. “It appears that the fire was sparked due to a short circuit in the air conditioner. Rudrakshi, who was sleeping near the air conditioner, was charred to death. Her sister Kritika too died the same way,” he said.Local resident H P Chaudhury said that people gathered at the spot immediately after they heard the building residents’ cry for help.“We immediately informed the police and also tried to douse the fire ourselves with water from pipes. There is only one entry and exit for each floor through the lobby of the ground floor and the fire had blocked it. Out of fear, an elderly woman jumped from the first floor and was caught by the people on the ground,” he said.Vivek Trivedi, station house officer, Phase 3 police station, said that Dinesh has received serious burn injuries.“His wife and son are recovering at the hospital. We have not received any complaint in this case,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/two-children-dead-three-others-injured-in-noida-fire-101629139233771.html
17-08-2021||Delhi||Safe for now but Afghans in Delhi lament a ‘future destroyed’||New Delhi: Since the past few days, Nazifa Stanikzai has barely slept. The Afghan national who reached Delhi 10 days ago is overwhelmed by fears for the safety of her relatives in strife-torn Kabul. Stanikzai and her family -- her husband and three children -- are among several Afghan nationals who arrived in Delhi in the last few days as Taliban continued their rapid advance across the country.Stanikzai, who came for medical treatment for herself and her son, never anticipated that the Taliban would take over the capital city of Kabul so swiftly. “It’s difficult to process what has happened. Never did we think that the Taliban would capture power so easily and everyone will abandon us. It feels like we are living through a nightmare and at some point, someone will wake us up,” said Stanikzai, as she sat along with her family on the steps of her rented one-room flat in Afghan Colony in Lajpat Nagar-2.A senior government official with the municipal body in Afghanistan, Stanikzai said that returning to Afghanistan is no longer an option as fear looms over the fate of those who worked with the government. “I was a government official with deputy director rank. My husband also worked with the government. All our biometrics and other details must have been accessed by now,” said Stanikzai, whose family lives in Kabul.She said that though she is grateful for being alive, she feared for the safety of her two sisters who were not married and had jobs. “Two of my sisters have jobs but their employers don’t want them to return. They are cooped up inside the house and cannot step out. If they stop working, there will be no one to support our extended family. Since the Taliban doesn’t allow unmarried women to step out, I am filled with dread for the fate of our girls,” she said, pointing to her daughters. “Their future has been destroyed. The future of our kids is destroyed.”Her 16-year-old daughter Misbah Zainab, a Class 11 student, has been receiving worrying updates from her friends since yesterday. Her phone is filled with pictures and videos from from their homeland. “My friend shared this picture last night. You can see the Taliban flag outside her house,” she said, showing one of the pictures.With the rapidly changing situation in Afghanistan, she seems uncertain about her future. “I wanted to become a pilot, but my mother says that I will not be able to become one in the prevailing circumstances,” said Zainab. Among other Afghan nationals who arrived in Delhi in the last few days is a 60-year-old who said that he will return shortly. “Since my family is in Afghanistan, I’ll have to return. Until then, I can only pray for them,” he said, requesting anonymity.Another man, who came to Delhi nearly 40 days ago on a medical visa, said that he is helpless. “People back home cannot step out. They are worried. We are here but worried for them. I have not eaten a morsel of food since yesterday (Sunday) morning,” said the Afghan national, who owns a transport and energy drink company in his country.He said that the future looked bleak, especially for those who had worked with the government and the US army: “I used to work with the American army and help them with transportation. Members of the Taliban came to know about my business and have been harassing my family, seeking my details. They have issued threats and seek donations. Going back will be akin to walking into a death trap but I have no choice. I will be happy even with meagre earning as long as I am with my family.”Abdul Salaam, 35, has been living in Lajpat Nagar-2 for the past three years due to a court case in Delhi and now runs a salon in the area. A native of Herat, he plans to request the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and other agencies to help him procure a visa for his wife and children. “My wife runs a ladies salon in Herat. With the Taliban coming back, she cannot work anymore. She told me that all pictures of women were removed from the salon. Everything is shut. My two children are with her. There is no certainty about what comes next,” said Salaam.Besides Afghans on a medical visa, long-time refugees in the country too are distressed as the Taliban’s rapid ascent to power has extinguished whatever little hopes they had of returning to their homeland. Yaar Mohammad, 40, came to India along with his wife in 2010 as they were compelled to leave Afghanistan in the face of Taliban attacks on his wife, a radio journalist. Since then, Mohammad and his wife are working as translators in the country. “Life in Afghanistan is suspended. There is no work, no hope, nothing to look forward to now. We never thought that the Taliban will return after decades. My family back home is uncertain and fear-stricken. No one knows what to expect anymore,” said Mohammad.Pointing to the ripple effect of the Taliban’s takeover, he said that this will result in more challenges for refugees in India.Translators such as Mohammad were already having a tough time since tourist visas were suspended last year owing to Covid-19 and in the absence of work, many such families are struggling to survive.“With the Taliban coming to power, all our hopes of going back are now over. People from Afghanistan will stop coming here since flights and diplomatic relations will be suspended. We have not earned a rupee since last year. Since we don’t get jobs, it is becoming increasingly difficult to feed our children,” said Mohammad.With moist eyes, he said that it was crucial for India to provide support for Afghan nationals. “India has invested so much in Afghanistan but everything has collapsed now. For the sake of humanity, it should allow Afghan Muslims to get citizenship in the county. If people of other faiths can get citizenship, what crime have we committed? The world has abandoned us,” said Mohammad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/safe-for-now-but-afghans-in-delhi-lament-a-future-destroyed-101629139229720.html
17-08-2021||Noida||Schools reopen for in-person classes, only 20% students turn up in GB Nagar||Government and private schools in Gautam Budh Nagar reopened for in-person classes for students of classes 9 to 12 on Monday for the first time since April when they were shut following the second wave of Covid-19 infections. Dharmveer Singh, district inspector of schools, said only 15%-20% of the total student strength turned up for their first day. “We inspected eight schools for Covid safety precautions and found that the strength of classes in many of them were very low, between 15% and 20%. Today was the first day which is probably why there were fewer students and the numbers may increase over the week. The schools that were inspected were found following instructions of the government on health protocols, such as the use of sanitisers, masks and social distancing, and were conducting classes in two shifts,” said Singh.He said that there are 150 Uttar Pradesh Secondary Board schools, and 200 CBSE schools in the district in which more than 100,000 children study in classes 9 to 12.Students were cheerful of going to the school after many months. Schools had first shut in March last year when the nation went into a lockdown in the face of the first wave of infections. In October last year, there was a gradual opening from October 2020 to March 2021 with many restrictions.This time too many of those restrictions were still in place - a cap on the student strength, in-person attendance only with the consent of the ward’s parent or guardian and online classes should go on.“I was anxious of coming to school but also excited. It feel good to be in a classroom again and be able to meet my classmates and teachers rather than seeing them through a small screen on my mobile,” said Ruchika Joshi, a student of class 12 at the Government Primary School, Sadarpur, Noida.“Out of 350 students, around 20% students came to school on Monday. The classes were held in two shifts- 8 am to noon then 12.30pm to 4.30 pm,” said Indu Sharma, principal of the school.At DPS Noida, practical classes for science subjects were held for students of class 12 from 7.45 am to 11.05 am. “A total of 30 students of class 12 came to school on Monday as we will be holding practical classes for the students till August 20 in batches of 30 students. Tomorrow, the next 30 students of class 12 will be coming. Online classes are resuming for the other classes,” said Kamini Bhasin, principal at the school.At Amity International School, Noida, only 2% of their students in classes 9 to 12 attended in-person.“We have followed all Covid protocols and have informed all 3,500 students in these classes of our schedule for conducting practical classes. Unfortunately, we received a poor response,” said Renu Singh, Principal of the school.Meanwhile, Manoj Kataria from Gautam Budh Nagar Parents Welfare Society said that while parents wanted to send their kids to attend in-person classes, they were scared due to Covid as well.“I had conducted a survey of 155 parents of students studying in classes 9-12 across GB Nagar asking them whether they are comfortable sending their children to school and 87.2% said no. I feel parents will be more comfortable once the government allows vaccines for children,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/schools-reopen-for-in-person-classes-only-20-students-turn-up-in-gb-nagar-101629139230158.html

The drive was carried out at 105 Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) that had facilities to vaccinate those who had booked their slots online as well as those who preferred on-spot registrations. Eight-one of these centres were temporary ones created by the health department for the drive in remote rural areas where most people preferred on-spot registrations.“We had set up these walk-in booths in schools, wedding halls and community centres even in rural remote areas so that people who had internet connectivity issues and so could not book their slots, could get their vaccination,” said Dr Sunil Kumar Sharma, Gautam Budh Nagar chief medical officer.According to official data, the district so far administered 1.8 million doses, of only 367,000 were two-dose vaccinations.For the vaccination drive, the district got over 30,000 doses from the state government on Monday morning, said officials.Dr Neeraj Tyagi, the Gautam Budh Nagar district immunization officer, said the district-wise ranking in terms of vaccinations administered will be released Tuesday morning. “We are just short of 2,000 vaccinations to reach the target. If we include vaccinations done at private CVCs, we will be exceeding the target. The target of 27,500 set by the government is for both government and private centres,” he said.During last mega vaccination on August 3, the district had vaccinated 42,316 beneficiaries, which was the highest ever by the district. GB Nagar had ranked 19th in Uttar Pradesh in that drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-vaccinates-over-29k-people-in-one-day-drive-101629139166893.html

17-08-2021||Chandigarh||Immigration fraud: Chandigarh man facing 377 complaints gets bail||The Punjab and Haryana high court has allowed bail to a Chandigarh resident accused of duping 377 people on the pretext of sending them abroad.The accused, Arvind Ashat, was initially booked in March 2017 on the complaint of one Rupinder Singh Grewal, who alleged that he had paid ₹4.94 lakh to him to arrange visas for students who wished to pursue studies abroad, but was cheated. The case was registered under Sections 420 (cheating) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code at the Sector-3 police station. Ashat had approached the high court on July 19 seeking bail and argued that he was arrested in April 2018 and has remained behind bars ever since.Chandigarh Police told the court that five challans covering 14 complainants have been filed against Ashat so far and another supplementary challan has been prepared after conducting inquiry into three more complaints. In all, there are 377 complaints against him, the court was told. The HC bench of justice TS Dhindsa observed that seeing the tardy pace, wherein only 17 of the 377 complaints have been looked into, it appears the investigation might not be concluded for another couple of years.“The factual premise that investigation is in progress would not be a ground to keep the petitioner indefinitely in custody and particularly keeping in view the slow pace of investigation. The amount of money which is alleged to have been taken by the petitioner on account of having duped the investors/complainants would be a subject matter of trial on the basis of evidence adduced,” the court said. It added that bail can’t be denied to the petitioner on the demand of the complainants that certain amount be first refunded to them, since he has been behind bars for over three years now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/immigration-fraud-chandigarh-man-facing-377-complaints-gets-bail-101629139107598.html

The decision was moved considering the fast-depleting groundwater level in the city. Last month, HT had reported that the groundwater depth had increased to more than 30 metres at many parts of Gautam Budh Nagar. Among the other areas that registered the steepest drops were Gulistanpur Primary school in Greater Noida where the groundwater fell by 8.87m (from 10.65m in 2019 to 19.52m in 2020). In Delta-3 of Greater Noida, the water levels increased by 3.59m, while in the Bisrakh Block the increase was 2.98m.“Once the Ganga water delivery begins these villages will not have to depend on groundwater,” said Deep Chand additional chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority.There are 254 villages under the authority’s jurisdiction. and most depend on groundwater for their daily needs. But other officials said they had received complaints that even this water was salty and unfit for drinking forcing people to rely on expensive water tanker supply. Chand said the authority will deliver piped Ganga water supply to all the urban centres and villages in the next two to three years.The ₹291. 77-crore project to supply Ganga water to Greater Noida households has missed several deadlines since it was first announced in 2010. In January, the Greater Noida Authority had announced it will start supply by April 30, 2021. But the city of 100,000households, needing almost 210million litres a day of water, still relies heavily on ground water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-authority-to-increase-ganga-water-supply-to-111-urban-villages-101629139048722.html
17-08-2021||Delhi||HC to hear parents’ plea for judicial probe into Dalit girl’s rape-murder||The Delhi high court on Tuesday will hear a plea by the parents of the minor Dalit girl, who was allegedly raped and murdered at a crematorium in Delhi Cantonment on August 1, seeking judicial probe into the alleged laxity by the police in conducting the preliminary probe.They parents have also demanded probe by a special investigation team into the incident.The petition, filed through advocate Jitendra Kumar Jha, is listed for hearing before Justice Yogesh Khanna. In their plea, the parents have alleged that the police delayed lodging the first information report (FIR), and that they were made to sit in the police station in between the intervening night of August 1-2.They petition said that even though the police reached the crematorium, they were focussing on “hushing up” the case. They petition said that the girl’s parents were forced by the police to keep quiet about the rape, and say that their daughter died of electrocution.“The petitioners were taken to the police station and throughout the night they were kept there and were tortured and pressured by the police to compromise the case,” the plea said, adding that the police arrested the accused but did not seek police custody for them.The parents have said that despite the case being transferred to the crime branch, they do not have faith in the present investigation and that the truth can only be proved by a court monitored special investigation team (SIT).The police have earlier denied allegations of laxity, saying all actions as per the law were being taken in the case. The police have informed a city court that it is yet to find any evidence to confirm that the girl was raped before she was allegedly murdered and forcibly cremated.The court noted that the investigating officer has admitted that neither any statement of any eye-witness nor any other evidence, including medical or scientific, could be collected so far to confirm as to whether the victim child was raped or not.The police also said that it only had the disclosure statement of two of the four accused admitting to the crime.“..the IO has stated that the disclosure statements of the four accused persons have revealed that accused Radhey Shyam and Kuldeep Singh had raped & killed the minor child victim and that the remaining two accused, namely Salim Ahmad and Laxmi Narayan, had helped them in trying to cremate the deceased minor child,” said court noted.On August 1, the girl was raped and killed allegedly by a priest and three of his male associates at the crematorium in Purani Nangal village near Delhi cantonment in southwest Delhi. The four men then cremated her body allegedly without her parents’ consent or the police being informed.The accused claimed that the girl died of electrocution while fetching water from a cooler but the family alleges that the suspects hurriedly cremated the body after raping her.The accused have been booked under Sections 302 (murder), 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code, along with the relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the SC/ST Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-to-hear-plea-by-dalit-girl-s-parents-seeking-judicial-probe-into-her-alleged-rapemurder-101629139047467.html

Even as the number of shots administered dropped to 4,046 on Independence Day, which was also a Sunday, on an average, over 97,000 doses have been administered each day in August so far. In comparison, over 68,800 doses were administered each day on an average during July. The number of people receiving the first dose of the vaccine has also increased from August 2, with the government gradually increasing the use of Covishield stock for the first stock.The number of second doses administered became higher than first doses since the third week of July. With 18-45-year-olds who were immunised in May when the vaccination drive opened for them becoming eligible for their second dose after the 84-day window between jabs, and vaccines in short supply, the government had to stop using Covishield for first dose-takers on July 22.“In the beginning of August, the government had directed that only 20% of the doses be used for first shot. This was increased to 40% the next week, and last week it was further increased up to 50% as the supplies stabilised. The districts, however, have the freedom to decide whether or not to use fewer vaccines for first dose, like we are utilising 40% at the moment,” said an official from south-west district. The official added, “There is huge demand for the first dose, whereas the demand for the second dose is low at the moment because fewer people received their first dose in May and have now completed the waiting gap of 84 days.” So far, 8.3 million of Delhi’s 20 million population have received at least one dose of the vaccine, and 3.3 million are fully vaccinated.Another official added that the number of vaccines administered in Delhi is likely to remain high for the month.“Although we come to know about the vaccine supply only around a week in advance, this month the supply has been stable and we are hoping that it will continue the same way. Last month, there were frequent shortages with the state rationing the number of doses given to the districts,” said an official from Shahadara district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-vaccination-picks-up-in-delhi-101629138986884.html

The mandi is known for slaughtering birds without having established a system for the same and thus polluting the environment.In the notice, the DPCC has asked the board as to why prosecution proceedings should not be initiated against it for allowing violation of norms both under the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the Delhi high court.“You (referring to the board) are requested to look into the matter and take appropriate measures to comply with the directions of the NGT as well as the Delhi HC, as your unit (Ghazipur mandi) is operating without a valid consent under the Water Act, 1974 and Air Act, 1981, apart from paying an environmental compensation,” said the notice.Last month, the NGT asked the DPCC to stop polluting activities and recover compensation from violators at the mandi.In its order dated July 28, the NGT directed the DPCC, the nodal agency in the matter, to identify, initiate prosecution and stop polluting activities from violators at Ghazipur Murga Mandi. The green panel also asked the pollution watchdog to prevent slaughtering of chickens in a haphazard manner, management of waste generated in the process of slaughtering of chickens and dressing/cutting and selling of fish.The order also stated that silting norms need to be evolved and followed in the complex, which is in the vicinity of Ghazipur landfill site and residential area. It also said the said market is one of the biggest livestock trading markets in Asia as well as the largest chicken slaughter hubs located in the national capital region (NCR).A 2018 Delhi high cout order asked for the closure of the mandi till it works out a system or creates a proper market place, complying with all statutory requirements, particularly the environment and pollution norms.A senior official from the Delhi Agricultural Marketing Board said, “We haven’t received the order yet and will be able to comment on the same only after seeing the order.” The market association could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-anti-pollution-body-issues-notice-over-violations-at-ghazipur-market-101629138927045.html

After the MP’s anticipatory bail was rejected by the Supreme Court the same month, he surrendered in a Varanasi court in June 2019. He is currently in jail.The woman filed another complaint against the MP and his close associate in December 2020 for maligning her image through propaganda on social media. According to the complaint, the woman alleged that ever since she filed the case against the politician, people associated with him have been harassing her and her family. She also alleged that at the MP’s behest, his close associate was running a vicious propaganda against her and a person who is a witness in the rape case.Gopal Rai, a representative of the Ghosi MP, said that the step taken by the woman was a move of “pressure politics” to divert attention of officials from the non-bailable warrant issued by a court in Varanasi recently (first week of August) in a case of forgery against the woman.Recently, a case was registered against the woman on a complaint lodged by the MP’s brother under IPC sections 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will), 468 (purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy).The police said the woman was “stressed” and wanted to protest the alleged harassment by the MP and his associates, inside the top court premises. A senior officer, who asked not to be named, said when she was denied entry into the court premises, the woman and her friend set themselves on fire.A video of the incident was being shared on social media, showing the two after they set themselves on fire. The video also showed some policemen throwing water at them to douse the fire.The officer quoted above said both the victims were unconscious when they were taken to the hospital. The police said they have burns mostly on their legs, but a medical assessment of their condition was awaited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/woman-man-set-themselves-on-fire-near-supreme-court-101629138868175.html

The directorate of education (DoE) issued guidelines and standard operating procedures for schools on August 9, asking principals to follow all sanitization protocols and check overcrowding at the premises. The education department also asked schools to acquire parents’ consent before calling students to school. While a few schools reopened last week, a majority of them are set to open their doors this week. Ahlcon International School in Mayur Vihar Phase 1, one of the few schools to reopen on Monday, said around 50% of its Class 12 students turned up on Monday. Of the approximately 200 students in Class 12, the school had called only three sections (105 students) on Monday.Headmaster Puneet Duggal said, “We have around 34-35 students in each section. Three sections of Class 12 were called in two batches for three subjects. Of them, around 95% turned up. We too were surprised with the turnout. Most of the children were happy to get out of their homes and come to school to interact with teachers and their peers. Teachers gave us feedback that students will take some time to get comfortable with the experiments taught in the practical classes due to lack of practice.”Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, which also reopened on Monday, saw 30% attendance on the first day. Principal Jyoti Arora, who is also a member of the action committee of over 400 private schools in the Capital, said, “We had called three sections of Class 12 and two of Class 11 for their practicals. While the attendance was nearly 30% of the total strength, we expect the attendance to increase in the coming days. We kept staggered timings and ensured there was a gap of 15 minutes before the dispersal of each class. Teachers were asked to remain at entry and exit points to ensure physical distancing. Students have also gotten used to wearing masks and following Covid-19 protocols on their own.”While more schools like Delhi Public School in Mathura Road, Amity International School in Pushp Vihar, The Indian School in Sheikh Sarai are expected to reopen this week, few schools, such as Bal Bharati Public School in Pitampura and Tagore International school, are expected to reopen later.Meenu Goswami, principal of Bal Bharati Public School, said, “We will be issuing the consent forms for parents this week and give them a week to respond. We are looking to resume practicals for only Class 12 students in the last week of August. Since we will be calling a few students and the same teachers will be teaching lessons for classes 11 and 12 students, we have to plan how to balance online and offline timetables and build alternatives for those who choose not to come to school.”Several government schools in Rohini, Tilak Nagar, Mayur Vihar, Chirag Delhi, Sarita Vihar, and Hauz Khas also reopened on Monday with students returning to school for the first time since April.Rakesh Semalty, principal of a government girls’ school in West Jyoti Nagar, said, “Since we have only one section in Class 12, which has 75 students, we have split them into multiple batches. Around 50% of the students turned up today (Monday). We will be getting in touch with school management committee members to encourage more students to join offline guidance classes. We have decided to start practicals next week and will continue with doubt-clearing sessions during school hours. In the meanwhile, online classes will continue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-schools-welcome-classes-10-12-students-some-yet-to-reopen-101629138866846.html

17-08-2021||Other||Monsoon may revive in Delhi, rain likely from August 20: IMD||After a week-long break phase, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted that the monsoon in Delhi may revive with a good spell of rainfall likely on August 20.According to IMD scientists, break monsoon conditions are still prevailing in the northwest region, including Delhi, and are likely to remain till at least August 18. “In the absence of any intense pressure system, the break phase of the monsoon is still continuing. However, a cyclonic circulation is expected over Madhya Pradesh around August 19, with which easterly winds will blow over Delhi and may result in rainfall,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.According to weather experts, a break monsoon is a phase of the south-west monsoon, when there is a stoppage in the monsoon rain. This pause could last a couple of days or even extend for a fortnight.Srivastava added that Delhi is likely to see thunder activity from August 19 night, followed by ‘light to moderate’ rainfall on August 20. “We are constantly watching the movement of the trough,” he said. The first fortnight of August has largely been dry with the city receiving less than half the rainfall considered normal for this time of the year. The monsoon entered a break phase in Delhi from August 9, and the city has not received any rainfall since. The city last received rain (15.4mm) on August 8. IMD records show that the Safdarjung observatory, considered to be representative of Delhi’s weather, has received only 63.2mm rain till August 16, leaving a deficit of 56%. Under normal circumstances, it receives 142.4 mm rainfall by this time.Similarly, the Palam weather station recorded just 55.5mm rain during the same period against the normal of 149.4 mm, recording a deficit of 63%. The Lodhi Road station also has a rain deficit of 70%, as it received only 42.1mm rain against a normal of 142.4mm.“So far, August has a rain deficit of 56%, as there has been little rainfall with a dry spell ranging over a week. This, however, may get covered within just one or two good spells of rain,” said Srivastava.He added that if one looks at the cumulative rainfall received during the monsoon so far, Delhi still has a surplus rainfall of 45%. This is mainly because July received short and intense spells of rain with the cumulative rainfall for the month reaching 507.1mmagainst the normal precipitation of 210.6mm. Since June 1, Delhi has received 605.1mm rainfall. The monsoon season lasts from June 1 to September 30 in the Capital.Explaining that this kind of weather normally does not prevail in August, as Delhi receives maximum rainfall during this month, Srivastava said it was mainly because of the “break” phase that a dry spell occurred during this time. “Break phase is a normal phenomenon during monsoon and at times can occur twice during the season,” he said.While IMD officials said that they are not giving long-range forecasts as they are not entirely accurate, they hinted that Delhi is likely to have a ‘near normal’ monsoon. A cumulative rainfall of 648.9mm during the season is considered a ‘normal’ monsoon. “The few intense spells in July have already covered more than half of the season’s normal rainfall amount. A few good spells during August may help Delhi get normal precipitation or even more,” said a senior IMD official who did not wish to be named.This is the second break phase of the monsoon in Delhi. The monsoon arrived in Delhi on July 13, at least 16 days behind schedule. The IMD had in June predicted that monsoon will arrive in the Capital by June 15. However later, it revised its forecast and said that break monsoon conditions had developed, which delayed the onset.Independent forecasters too said that the second half of the month could be better and may cover up for the first half.Mahesh Palawat, vice president of Skymet, a private forecaster, said the monsoon trough is likely to shift back to south and result in light to moderate showers in northwest India, including Delhi, Punjab and Haryana on August 19. “A low-pressure system is being formed in the Bay of Bengal, which will move over parts of central India such as Madhya Pradesh. With this, the trough is likely to move south and bring rainfall in Delhi and surrounding region,” said Palawat. , for which the weather department has issued an ‘orange’ alert in its forecast update on Monday||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/monsoon-may-revive-in-delhi-rain-likely-from-august-20-imd-101629138746895.html
17-08-2021||Delhi||No respite from traffic jams at Ashram till at least Dec||The traffic mess at the busy Ashram Chowk is expected to continue till December this year with the Public Works Department (PWD) saying that it will miss the August deadline for the construction of a 750-metre underpass at the key traffic intersection, work on which has been going on since December 2019.To be sure this was the third deadline for the project that the department failed to meet. The first deadline for the project was set for December 2020, the second for April 2021. Having failed to finish the project, the PWD last revised the deadline to August 2021.Ashram, which is one of the busiest stretches in the Capital, sees over 350,000 vehicles passing every day during peak rush hours of morning and evening. Even though the work was still on to construct the underpass that connects Nizamuddin Railway Bridge and CSIR Apartments at the Ashram intersection, the government in February simultaneously launched work on extending the Ashram flyover on Ring Road. The two projects running together have made Ashram that connects south and central Delhi, and virtually serves as the connection for two NCR cities Noida and Faridabad — a traffic nightmareBesides prolonged and haphazard construction, poor site management and extension of barricades for building the underpass, have made the situation worse.Senior PWD officials have cited ban on construction activities due to air pollution in November 2019, assembly polls in February 2020, pandemic-induced lockdowns and labour shortage and financial crunch as some of the reasons that delayed work on the crucial project.A senior PWD official expressed the hope that they will be able to meet the latest deadline. “The delay this time has been caused due to shortage of labour. The second Covid wave has impacted our functioning on all the projects and we are lagging behind the deadlines. Now, the new deadlines have been made keeping in mind all parameters and if things go on smoothly, we will complete the construction at Ashram Chowk and underpass weeks before this year ends,” the official said asking not to be named.A Delhi government spokesperson did not comment on the matter.A traffic police officer said, “The traffic plan for the extension of the Ashram flyover includes the placement of barricades on the Kilokri side and on Maharani Bagh side of Ring Road, and this has caused a bottleneck.”People who commute daily through the stretch say it has been a never ending traffic chaos at the Ashram intersection. At first, it was the Metro construction, then the closure of the Kalindi Kunj border because of the Shaheen Bagh protest and now, the construction work has been hampering traffic movement here, said Vaibhav Chadha.“This stretch is always the problem area. I don’t know when and how the problem will be resolved. In order to get to work every day, I have to leave almost home an hour earlier. My whole schedule goes for a toss,” said Chadha.Experts said the situation has turned worse with the work on the underpass and flyover extension projects have overlapped.“The construction work here at Ashram has been a major problem for the commuters and even if the work at the Ashram underpass is completed, I feel it is not going to cause respite to the commuters who take this route until the work for the extension of the Ashram flyover is completed,” said Dr. S Velmurugan, Chief Scientist, Central Road Research Institute (CRRI). He said the the high traffic volume on Mathura Road and Ring Road should have made the completion of the Ashram underpass project a top priority for the construction agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ashram-chowk-underpass-to-miss-yet-another-deadline-traffic-chaos-to-continue-101629138627519.html

Representing the NDMC, its counsel Anil Grover, told the court that the municipal body is functioning properly.However, this did not go well with the court which remarked, “You may be functioning well, but if the Act mandates, then you have to appoint the persons”.Anurag Ahluwalia, the standing counsel for the Central government, said there was fundamental objection to the petition and the petitioners ought to have filed a public interest litigation.To this, Sahni submitted that the petitioners are also aggrieved parties as they are residents of the NDMC area. The matter would be heard next in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-seeks-response-on-plea-to-appoint-four-members-to-ndmc-101629138628309.html

It also expressed shock at the minister’s statement that there are no proposals to make them permanent.DUTA president Rajib Ray said they have been highlighting the plight of ad-hoc teachers in multiple correspondence letters and memorandums with the Union ministry of education. The teachers’ body also said that as per February 2021 data based on electoral rolls published by DU for election of statutory bodies, there are 4,177 ad-hoc teachers, 6,089 permanent faculty members, and 22 temporary faculty members in in DU. Ad-hoc teachers constitute nearly 40% of the university’s teaching strength of around 10,000, which is much more than the target of 10% set by the government.Despite repeated calls and messages, there was no response from the Ministry of Education.Ad-hoc teachers in DU are appointed on a contract basis that is renewable every four months. Despite years of service under their belt, these teachers have not seen an increase in their pay since they started working and are not eligible for other benefits like the paid maternity leave. “It is shameful that the [response] annexure (submitted by Pradhan) states that there are 58 ad-hoc teachers in the University of Delhi as on April 1, 2021, when this is so far from reality... It is a well-known fact that around 4,500 teachers are currently working on an ad-hoc basis in DU, with the number increasing every day as no recruitments have taken place for over 10 years now and many teachers have superannuated in the interim period,” said DUTA president Rajib Ray.The teachers’ body held a press conference on Monday to express shock at the minister’s statement that the government has no proposal for absorbing the existing ad-hoc teachers into permanent service. In December 2019, thousands of DU teachers protested outside the vice-chancellor’s office and went on a strike for over a month demanding absorption and regularisation of these teachers.In a memorandum sent to Pradhan on Monday, DUTA wrote, “Though these teachers perform the same duties as their permanent colleagues, they have been denied basic rights to a dignified life. Despite fulfilling all the requisite academic qualifications like NET/JRF, M.Phil, PhD, post-doctorate, etc. from prestigious universities in India and abroad, and having teaching experience for years, these teachers are yet to be regularised in their respective positions...”“The UGC/MHRD should frame a specific regulation which allows the regularisation of serving temporary/ad-hoc teachers on a permanent basis through a one-time absorption,” they demanded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dutaobjects-to-ministers-statement-says-there-are-over-4-000-ad-hoc-teachers-in-du-101629138626826.html

With the decision, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) will save 20 paise per unit in electricity generation from the thermal plant. This saving will be generated as the distance between the raw material and the user plant has decreased; NCL has coal mines in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and other nearby states, as compared to the SECL’s mines in the deep south of the country. As of now, NPL has been sourcing coal from different Coal India Limited (CIL) subsidiaries under a Fuel Supply Agreement FSA with the SECL. In this arrangement, PSPCL was being billed the actual cost of coal in terms of the much-maligned Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). CIL, however, wants the NPL to enter into a supplementary Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the distribution companies or the PSPCL. This agreement, to be approved by the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission,will mandate the passing on of the savings on account of linkage rationalization to the PSPCL. Punjab has asked for a waiver of this clause, as the entire power that NPL produces is supplied only to the PSPCL through a long-term PPA. PSPCL chairman and managing director A Venu Prasad said the utility was trying everything within its means to reduce power generation cost. “I do hope that with the change of coal linkage, the PSPCL will save between 20 paise and 22 paise per unit of electricity generated from NPL. Not only freight will reduce, but coal quality is also better,” he added. “The savings due to the use of such linkage of domestic coal will automatically be passed on to distribution to companies, and ultimately to consumers. These power plants will use the transferred coal only for generation of electricity for supply to the state,” said CMD, said saying that the PSPCL has asked the coal ministry to waive one of its conditions of a supplementary PPA, as it is not required for NPL and other plants. “PSPCL has sought this waiver as it wants to start coal lifting from NCL, as soon as possible, to reduce power generation cost. We are also trying to get coal linkages from nearby locations, to save freight cost, which has doubled over the past few years,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nabha-power-plant-gets-nearer-coal-linkage-pspcl-to-save-20-paise-per-unit-101629134307230.html
17-08-2021||Kolkata||Sushmita Dev quits Congress, shifts to TMC||Kolkata/Silchar: Former Silchar MP Sushmita Dev quit the Congress and joined the Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Monday, prompting criticism within the principal opposition party and potentially helping Bengal’s ruling party expand its political footprint in the north-east. Dev was the national spokesperson of the Congress and the chief of the All India Mahila Congress.She sent her resignation letter to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in a letter dated August 15 but didn’t mention any reasons for her resignation. “I cherish my three decade long association with the Indian National Congress...I hope I have your good wishes as I begin a new chapter in my life of public service,” she said in the letter that became public on Monday.Later on Monday, she flew to Kolkata and joined the TMC in the presence of the party’s national general secretary, Abhishek Banerjee. The 48-year-oldformer legislator was accompanied by TMC leader of Rajya Sabha, Derek O’Brien. She also visited Nabanna, the state secretariat, and met chief minister Mamata Banerjee. “Met TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee and had a good discussion with him...then the three of us met the (West Bengal) chief minister. She clearly has an excellent future vision for the party,” said Dev in a video message. The TMC welcomed her. “Inspired by @MamataOfficial, she joins us today in the presence of our national general secretary @abhishekaitc & parliamentary party Leader, Rajya Sabha, @derekobrienmp,” TMC tweeted..Dev and O’Brien are slated to address the media in Delhi on Tuesday. Dev’s entry into the TMC comes even as the party is trying to bring together like-minded parties to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), currently the national political hegemon. Since the party’s landslide victory against the BJP in the West Bengal assembly elections in May, party chief and state chief minister Banerjee has sought to work towards this. Dev, a popular leader from the Bengali-dominated Barak valley region of Assam, is likely to help the TMC’s plans of expanding its political footprint beyond West Bengal. The TMC is also hoping to spread its base in neighbouring Tripura.“I cannot predict anything right now but any leader who is sincere about fighting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is welcome on board,” TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh said. Dev is the daughter of former Union minister Santosh Mohan Dev who also represented the Silchar seat as well as Tripura West Lok Sabha in the adjoining state. He died in 2017. Her mother, Bithika Dev, is also a former legislator from Silchar. Leaders in Assam said Dev clashed with the party’s state leadership during the recently concluded assembly elections over ticket distribution. “I am the king maker in Barak Valley and we have performed much better than the Brahmaputra Valley...but APCC [Assam Pradesh Congress Committee] did not give our hard-fought win proper respect...there is a limit, and we cannot continue serving like second class workers in the party,” she said in March. Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal blamed the party for her departure. “Sushmita Dev resigns from primary membership of our party. While young leaders leave we ‘oldies’ are blamed for our efforts to strengthen it. The party moves on with :Eyes Wide Shut,” he tweeted. Sibal is part of a group of Congress leaders who wrote to Gandhi last year, demanding organisational changes in the party. Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said Gandhi had not received Dev’s letter. “I tried speaking with Dev but her phone was off. She was a dedicated Congress worker and perhaps is, even today. Sonia Gandhi has not received any letter from her. She (Dev) is mature enough to make her decisions, and I cannot comment till I speak with her,” he told reporters in Delhi.Former Bengal Congress chief Pradip Bhattacharya said: “I am surprised. Dev held a high post in the Congress. Probably she had some grievances.” Dev’s resignation marks another high-profile departure from the Congress. In June, former Union minister of state Jitin Prasada quit and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/sushmita-dev-joins-tmc-a-day-after-quitting-congress-101629110244999.html

Trudeau said the Taliban seizing the power in Afghanistan by force was the reason Canada won't recognise the Islamist fundamentalist group as the government."Canada has no plans to recognize the Taliban as the Government of Afghanistan," Trudeau told reporters. "They have taken over and replaced a duly elected democratic government by force."Statements from countries like Russia and Turkey have been positive on the takeover, indicating that they may recognise the Taliban as the legitimate stakeholders.(with inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-will-not-recognise-taliban-as-afghan-govt-says-pm-justin-trudeau-101629221046161.html
17-08-2021||World||Withdrawal of diplomats to India’s emergency e-visa move: Key developments in Afghan crisis||India on Tuesday withdrew its ambassador and diplomatic staff from Kabul, flying out some 150 people in a C-17 Globemaster heavy lift aircraft from the Afghanistan capital two days after a Taliban takeover of the war-torn country. Another 45 diplomats and security personnel were brought back by a C-17 aircraft on Monday as part of an extensive evacuation programme that was kept tightly under wraps and put into motion after the Indian side received credible inputs about possible threats from rouge elements and Pakistani terror groups.The two C-17s flew into Kabul using a circuitous route through Iranian airspace and over the Arabian Sea to avoid flying over Pakistan or spending too much time in the uncontrolled Afghan airspace. As the Kabul airport is small and the aircraft were offered slots of limited duration, the C-17s halted in the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe till it was time for them to fly into Kabul to pick up their passengers. “In view of the prevailing situation in Kabul, it was decided that our embassy personnel would be immediately moved to India. This movement has been completed in two phases and the ambassador and all other India-based personnel have reached New Delhi [on Tuesday] afternoon,” the external affairs ministry said.The withdrawal of ambassador Rudrendra Tandon and other staff from Kabul reflected India’s misgivings about the Taliban’s assurances that all embassies and diplomats would be provided security. Taliban spokesman Suhail Saheen had tweeted on Monday night that no problems will be created for diplomats, embassies and charitable workers but this failed to reassure the Indian side. Tandon, who had taken up his assignment in Kabul only in August last year, told reporters during an interaction at Gujarat’s Jamnagar airbase, where the C-17 jet halted to refuel on Tuesday, that some Indian citizens were still in Afghanistan and Air India would continue operating flights from Kabul as long as the airport there remains functional to bring them back. He added, “As you know, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan no longer exists and the situation is quite fluid now.” Air India has temporarily suspended its flights to Kabul because of conditions at the airport, but the external affairs ministry has opened a help desk and will ensure that anyone stuck in Kabul is brought back, he said. Asked about the number of Indian nationals who are still in Afghanistan, Tandon said it would be difficult to give an exact figure as Indians didn’t always register themselves with the embassy in Kabul despite advisories. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that at least 300 Indian nationals, including those working for Western firms and other professionals, were believed to be in Afghanistan. Flights by Air India to bring back these Indians are expected to resume once the civilian side of Kabul’s Hamid Karzai international airport reopens. The airport, currently under the control of US troops, was closed on Monday following chaotic scenes as thousands of Afghans seeking to flee the Taliban entered the facility and marched onto the tarmac. Some desperately clung onto a US military aircraft and at least two people plunged to their death.External affairs minister S Jaishankar was involved in efforts to oversee the timely departure of the two military flights that evacuated the diplomats and other nationals. At almost 3 am on Tuesday, he tweeted about his discussions in this regard with US secretary of state Antony Blinken: “Discussed latest developments in Afghanistan with @SecBlinken. Underlined the urgency of restoring airport operations in Kabul.” On Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security to assess the situation in Afghanistan. The meeting was attended by Jaishankar, home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and ambassador Tandon. Meanwhile, the Union home ministry announced on Tuesday it had reviewed visa provisions in view of the situation in Afghanistan and introduced a new category of electronic visas called “e-Emergency X-Misc Visa” to fast-track applications by Afghan nationals. India has also received requests from Afghan Sikh and Hindu community leaders and is in touch with them.The people cited above said the Indian embassy in Kabul was technically not shut down as it is still being manned by local Afghan staff – an arrangement similar to the one made for the consulates in Kandahar and Mazar-e-Sharif, from where all Indian staff were pulled out in recent weeks as the security situation deteriorated. The local staff have been given specific assignments and are being paid their salaries.The decision regarding the withdrawal of India’s diplomatic personnel and other staff was based on two factors – the security of the personnel and ensuring that their departure was not perceived as abandonment by Afghan partners. An earlier Indian assessment had suggested the Taliban would continue negotiations to gain legitimacy, at least till August 31, when the US drawdown was to be completed, but the situation changed swiftly as the Taliban marched towards Kabul over the weekend.Afghan law enforcement personnel and police forces “simply vanished” and were replaced by the Taliban, one of the people cited above said. That was when the green signal was given to withdraw all personnel from the embassy in Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/withdrawal-of-diplomats-to-india-s-emergency-e-visa-move-key-developments-in-afghan-crisis-101629222100312.html
17-08-2021||World||Embassies, aid organisations will be safe in Kabul: Taliban's Mujahid||The Taliban held its maiden news conference on Tuesday days after taking control of Kabul, in which they assured security of embassies and diplomatic missions in Afghanistan.Addressing the reporters in Kabul, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said the security of foreign embassies is important to them and pledged to keep them completely safe, Afghanistan's television news channel Tolo News reported.Mujahid says that the security of foreign embassies is important to them and they pledge that the embassies will be completely safe. pic.twitter.com/uNf6zOc4lkZabihullah Mujahid reportedly said the Taliban do not have "enmity towards anyone" and have "pardoned everyone" on their leader's orders.Earlier in the day, the Taliban declared an “amnesty” across Afghanistan and urged women to join its government in an attempt to allay the fears of thousands of Afghans who attempted to flee the country. Mujahid says they have pardoned everyone and will not take revenge against anyone, including former military members and those who worked with the foreign forces. "No one will search their house," Mujahid says. pic.twitter.com/JGE6jTgzRNMujahid said the Taliban would honour women’s rights but within the norms of Islamic law. He echoed the voice of Enamullah Samangani, a member of the Taliban’s cultural commission, who said earlier in the day that women are encouraged to join the government."Taliban are committed to providing women with their rights based on Islam. Women can work in the health sector and other sectors where they are needed. There will be no discrimination against women," TOLO News quoted Mujahid as saying.The Taliban spokesperson outlined that they would work a settlement through which an "Islamic government would be established in the country".ALSO READ | Turkey welcomes 'positive messages' from Taliban after 'amnesty' announcementAfter taking over the presidential palace in Kabul on Sunday, and setting the stage for their rule in Afghanistan, 20 years after their ouster, the Taliban attempted to project a less aggressive face by saying no one would be "harmed", assurance thousands of Afghans are apprehensive of.

17-08-2021||World||Taliban vow to honour Afghan women's rights, but within 'Islamic law'||The Taliban vowed Tuesday to respect women's rights, forgive those who resisted them and ensure a secure Afghanistan as part of a publicity blitz aimed at convincing world powers and a fearful population that they have changed.Following a lightning offensive across Afghanistan that saw many cities fall to the insurgents without a fight, the Taliban have sought to portray themselves as more moderate than when they imposed a brutal rule in the late 1990s. But many Afghans remain skeptical — and thousands raced to the airport on Monday, desperate to flee the country.Older generations remember the Taliban’s ultraconservative Islamic views, which included severe restrictions on women as well as public stonings and amputations before they were ousted by the U.S-led invasion following the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.As others have in recent days, spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid addressed these concerns head-on in his first news conference Tuesday.Mujahid, who had been a shadowy figure for years, promised the Taliban would honor women’s rights, but within the norms of Islamic law, though he gave few details. He said the group wanted private media to “remain independent,” but stressed journalists “should not work against national values.”And he promised the insurgents would secure Afghanistan — but seek no revenge against those who worked with the former government or with foreign governments or forces.“We assure you that nobody will go to their doors to ask why they helped,” he said.Earlier, Enamullah Samangani, a member of the Taliban’s cultural commission, made similar promises, saying the Taliban would extend an “amnesty” without giving details and encouraging women to join the government.The capital of Kabul remained quiet for another day as the Taliban patrolled its streets and many residents stayed home, fearful after the insurgents’ takeover saw prisons emptied and armories looted. Many women have expressed dread that the two-decade Western experiment to expand their rights and remake Afghanistan would not survive the resurgent Taliban.Germany, meanwhile, halted development aid to Afghanistan over the Taliban takeover. Such aid is a crucial source of funding for the country — and the Taliban's efforts to project a milder version of themselves may be aimed at ensuring that money continues to flow.While the Taliban pledged not to go after their enemies, some in Kabul allege the fighters have lists of people who cooperated with the government and are seeking them out. A broadcaster in Afghanistan said she was hiding at a relative’s house, too frightened to return home much less return to work following reports that the insurgents are also looking for journalists. She said she and other women didn't believe the Taliban had changed their ways. She spoke on condition of anonymity because she feared for her safety.Samangani addressed the concerns of women, saying a Taliban were ready to "provide women with environment to work and study, and the presence of women in different (government) structures according to Islamic law and in accordance with our cultural values.”That would be a marked departure from the last time the Taliban were in power, when women were largely confined to their homes.In another sign of the Taliban's efforts to portray a new image, a female television anchor on the private broadcaster Tolo interviewed a Taliban official on camera Tuesday in a studio — an interaction that once would have been unthinkable. Meanwhile, women in hijabs demonstrated briefly in Kabul, holding signs demanding the Taliban not “eliminate women” from public life.Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the United Nations’ high commissioner for human rights, noted both the Taliban’s vows and the fears of everyday Afghans.“Such promises will need to be honored, and for the time being — again understandably, given past history — these declarations have been greeted with some skepticism,” he said in a statement. “There have been many hard-won advances in human rights over the past two decades. The rights of all Afghans must be defended.”Germany, meanwhile, suspended development aid to Afghanistan, estimated at 250 million euros ($294 million) for 2021. Other funding separately goes to security services and humanitarian aid. Sweden indicated it would slow aid to the country, but Britain committed to an increase.British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said humanitarian aid could rise by 10%. He said the aid budget would be reconfigured for development and humanitarian purposes and that the Taliban would not get any money previously earmarked for security.Meanwhile, Kabul's international airport, the only way out for many, reopened to military evacuation flights under the watch of American troops.All flights were suspended on Monday when thousands of people rushed the airport. In shocking scenes captured on video, some clung to a plane as it took off and then fell to their deaths. At least seven people died in chaos at the airport, U.S. officials said.By late Tuesday, the Taliban entered the civilian half of the airport, firing into the air to drive out around 500 people there, said an Afghan official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to brief journalists.Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said U.S. commanders at the airport are communicating with Taliban leaders to keep the airlift going, adding that there have been no hostile actions by the Taliban.Still, there were indications that the situation remained tenuous. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul, now operating from the airport, urged Americans to register online for evacuations but not come to the airport before being contacted.The German Foreign Ministry said a first German military transport plane landed in Kabul, but it took off with only seven people on board due to continued chaos. Another left later with 125 people.Across Afghanistan, the International Committee of the Red Cross said thousands had been wounded in fighting as the Taliban swept across the country in recent days, ahead of the planned withdrawal of the last American troops at the end of the month.As U.S. President Joe Biden did, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg blamed the swift collapse of the country on a failure of Afghan leadership. But he added that the alliance must also uncover flaws in its effort to train the Afghan military.Talks continued Tuesday between the Taliban and several Afghan government officials, including former President Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, who once headed the country’s negotiating council.Discussions focused on how a Taliban-dominated government would operate given the changes in Afghanistan over the last 20 years, rather than just dividing up who controlled what ministries, officials with knowledge of the negotiations said. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential details of the talks.A top Taliban leader, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, arrived in Kandahar on Tuesday night from Qatar. His arrival may signal a deal is close at hand.But in a possible complication, the vice president of the ousted government claimed on Twitter Tuesday that he was the country's “legitimate” caretaker president. Amrullah Saleh said, under the constitution, he should be in charge because President Ashraf Ghani has fled the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-vow-to-honour-afghan-women-s-rights-but-within-islamic-law-101629217859737.html
17-08-2021||World||'Shameful': Macron sparks controversy with Afghan illegal migration pledge||French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday faced accusations from the left and activists that he was letting down ordinary Afghans after he pledged a robust European approach against illegal migration in the wake of the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban.His stance however gladdened the right in France in what is due to be one of the most contentious battlegrounds as Macron prepares for 2022 presidential elections that may come down to a duel with the far-right.Macron promised in a televised address on Monday that France would "protect those who are most under threat in Afghanistan" while also vowing Europe would put together a "robust" initiative to thwart illegal migration and in particular people-smuggling networks."We must anticipate and protect ourselves against significant irregular migratory flows that would endanger the migrants and risk encouraging trafficking of all kinds," he said.Macron also said France was ready to help Afghan activists, artists and journalists who risk being targeted because of their work, but it is not immediately clear what numbers this will entail.Green MP Matthieu Orphelin, a former member of Macron's ruling party, accused Macron "of mixing up asylum and irregular migration". Fellow Green Yannick Jadot, a possible contender in 2022, said he was "astonished to hear that people fleeing the "hell of the Taliban could be considered a threat".Prominent Socialist senator Laurence Rossignol called the comments "cynical" and shameful" while centrist MP Aurelien Tache, another former member of Macron's party, said he hoped the "president would not be so tough when it comes to acts"."People who flee war, oppression and death are not irregular migratory flows," said Dominique Sopo, head of the NGO SOS Racisme.The League for Human Rights said with his comments Europe was "sub-contracting asylum for Afghans to neighbouring countries".- 'Firm against trafficking' -France, like several other European countries, has suspended the expulsion of Afghan asylum seekers. More Afghans applied for asylum in France in 2020 than from any other nation."France is very attentive to the situation of the Afghans," said a French presidential official, asking not to be named."But that does not prevent us being very firm in the face of trafficking and networks who profit from misery and fear. This would be proof of naivety and lack of responsibility."Far-right leader Marine Le Pen, potentially Macron's main challenger in the elections, warned that "for our country this situation will mean an increased risk of attacks and the possibility of new waves of immigration".Heavyweight right-wing former minister Xavier Bertrand, who is also standing in the elections, warned: "The Afghan crisis will continue in the form of a migration wave in Europe".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shameful-macron-sparks-controversy-with-afghan-illegal-migration-pledge-101629217510353.html

17-08-2021||World||Afghan crisis: Granddaughter of Frontier Gandhi says world powers must intervene||As Afghanistan plunged into a state of panic and chaos while Taliban fighters poured into Kabul on Sunday, more than 2,000 kilometres away in Kolkata, 50-year-old Yasmin Nigar Khan prayed for the safety and security of the people there. She hopes for world powers to intervene to end the crisis.“What we are hearing and seeing on media is very worrying. I am not sure what’s in store for the future. But this should come to an end. I hope the world powers, the United Nations would intervene and put an end to this,” said Khan.Family members claim Khan’s father, Khan Lala Jaan Khan, who died in 1996, was adopted by Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, better known as ‘Frontier Gandhi’, to continue the struggle for Pashtunistan from India.Khan Lala Jaan Khan settled in Kolkata and formed the All India Pakhtoon Jirga-e-Hind (an organisation of Pakhtoons or Pathans in India) in 1949.“I visited Kabul with my father for the first and last time in 1986 to attend a meeting of tribal leaders from across the world. I have very fond memories of the country. Back then, I saw girls wearing jeans and skirts even though they had their hijab on. But look at the country now. It is shattered. Four decades of war have ruined everything,” said Yasmin.She took over as the president of the All India Pakhtoon Jirga-e-Hind after her father’s death. A laminated picture of Frontier Gandhi and a portrait of him along with Mahatma Gandhi could be seen on the table in her office at Karim Hussain Lane near Park Circus in southeast Kolkata.“Even though I don’t have any relatives in Afghanistan, there are many Pakhtoons in Kolkata and West Bengal who have their loved ones back in that country. They are getting calls every day. What we are seeing on media could be just the tip, as social media has been blocked and people are afraid of saying anything in open,” said Arshad Ahmed Danish Khan, her brother, who is the secretary of the organization.In 1892, Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore wrote the iconic short story, Kabuliwala - a tale of an Afghan citizen living in Kolkata. In 1957, noted director Tapan Sinha made a film on it.“My father was sent to India by Frontier Gandhi and he settled in Kolkata. The Pakhtuns have always had an emotional attachment to Kolkata,” said Arshad, who, along with her sister Yasmin, was born and brought up in Kolkata.The family says that most of the Afghan people would not like the Taliban, as they are not from Afghanistan. They are ‘outsiders’“I am sure 90% of the citizens in Afghanistan would not like the Taliban. When I went to Afghanistan back then there were the mujahedeen. Even they were better than the Taliban. The Taliban fighters are a proxy army created by Pakistan. I am sure if people’s mandate is taken, they would not get even 10% votes. We all want peace,” said Yasmin||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-powers-must-intervene-to-end-afghan-crisis-granddaughter-of-frontier-gandhi-101629211776571.html
17-08-2021||World||Afghanistan's first VP Amrullah Saleh declares himself caretaker president||Afghanistan’s first vice president Amrullah Saleh on Tuesday added a new twist to the ongoing crisis, claiming he is now the caretaker president after Ashraf Ghani fled the war-torn country. Citing the provisions of the Constitution of Afghanistan, Saleh said that the first vice president automatically becomes the caretaker president in the event of the president’s absence, escape or resignation.“Clarity: As per d constitution of Afg, in absence, escape, resignation or death of the President the FVP becomes the caretaker President. I am currently inside my country & am the legitimate care taker President. Am reaching out to all leaders to secure their support & consensus,” tweeted Saleh.Saleh has not accepted the takeover by the Taliban, saying he will never be under "one ceiling" with the Islamist fundamentalists. On Sunday, Ashraf Ghani's former deputy said he'll never betray the "soul" and "legacy of my hero Ahmad Shah Masoud", the late Afghan politician and military commander who fought against the Soviet occupation between 1979 and 1989.Earlier today, Saleh called on anti-Taliban groups to join the "resistance", saying they have not lost spirit unlike the United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato)."It is futile to argue with@POTUS on Afg now. Let him digest it. We d Afgs must prove tht Afgh isn't Vietnam & the Talibs aren't even remotely like Vietcong. Unlike US/NATO we hvn't lost spirit & see enormous oprtnities ahead.

Here's why||After the Taliban pledged general amnesty for those who worked for the previous Afghan government and freedom for women to work, the United Nations on Tuesday said the actions of the insurgents will be scrutinised closely. UN human rights office spokesperson Rupert Colville told reporters in Geneva that given the past history of the Taliban, such promises have been greeted with scepticism.“Nevertheless, the promises have been made, and whether or not they are honoured or broken will be closely scrutinized,” the spokesperson said.The Taliban have made a slew of promises to calm the nerves as thousands of Afghans thronged Kabul airport in a desperate attempt to flee the war-torn country now under the control of Islamist fundamentalists. They have issued statements promising a new era of peace in Afghanistan after decades of war.Also Read | ‘We are not cowards,’ says Afghan soldier who trained at IMA, DehradunColville drew attention to the “chilling reports” of human rights abuses and restrictions on the rights of women and girls in some parts of Afghanistan captured by the Taliban over the past few weeks. He said that such reports continue to emerge but they are not in a position to verify the allegations since the flow of information has been considerably disrupted.Colville said that the Taliban have an obligation to protect civilians and to uphold human rights. Highlighting the hard-won gains on the human rights front over the past two decades in Afghanistan, he stressed that the Talian must respect and protect both international humanitarian law and international human rights law.“We call on the international community to extend all possible support to those who may be at imminent risk, and we call on the Taliban to demonstrate through their actions, not just their words, that the fears for the safety of so many people from so many different walks of life are addressed,” the spokesperson added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-not-convinced-with-taliban-s-promise-of-peace-and-inclusivity-here-s-why-101629202759860.html

"As the situation in Afghanistan continues to deteriorate rapidly, WHO is extremely concerned over the unfolding safety and humanitarian needs in the country, including risk of disease outbreaks and rise in Covid-19 transmission," WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic said during a United Nations (UN) briefing on Tuesday.Reuters reported that Jasarevic also told a UN briefing that the chaos at Kabul international airport where thousands of people gathered, trying to flee the Taliban regime, was slowing deliveries of medical supplies.Also Read: Germany temporarily halts development aid for Afghanistan, evacuation continuesWHO’s statement comes days after reports emerged of Islamist militant group Taliban banning Covid-19 vaccines in east Afghanistan's Paktia. Afghanistan-based radio and television platform Shamshad News had reported on August 13 that a notice in this regard had been put up by the Taliban at the Paktia Regional Hospital.The UN body’s mobile health teams have been on hold in capital city Kabul for the past 24 hours as the city is besieged with chaos and disruptions. WHO, much like other UN agencies, have pledged to stay put in Afghanistan saying they remain committed to their mission. WHO has recorded 152,142 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 7,025 deaths in Afghanistan between January 3 and August 16. The country has administered a total of 1,809,517 vaccine doses till August 10.UN has been urging the Taliban to keep its word of granting “amnesty” to former government employees and allow women and girls access to basic human rights. Some agencies of the UN, such as the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) have been striking a more positive tone and voicing their optimism.“We have ongoing discussions, we are quite optimistic based on those discussions.

17-08-2021||World||New Zealand to enter lockdown after single virus case found||New Zealand's government took drastic action Tuesday by putting the entire nation into a strict lockdown for at least three days after finding a single case of coronavirus infection in the community.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern invoked some of the stirring rhetoric she used early in the pandemic by urging the “team of 5 million” — New Zealand's population — to go hard and early in trying to eliminate the latest outbreak."We have seen what happens elsewhere if we fail to get on top of it," Ardern said. “We only get one chance.”She said Auckland, where the infected man lives, and Coromandel, where he had visited, would go into a full lockdown for seven days and the remainder of the country for three days while health experts tried to find the source of his infection.The developments prompted people to line up outside supermarkets to stock up on essential items and sparked a sharp drop in the value of the New Zealand dollar.New Zealand had managed to stamp out the virus, and the last outbreak was in February. But Ardern had been warning that the contagiousness of the delta variant would likely require more drastic action than previous outbreaks.New Zealand has also been slower than other developed nations to inoculate its population, leaving it vulnerable to outbreaks. Only 32% of people have had at least one shot and 18% are fully vaccinated.And officials have been viewing a growing outbreak in nearby Sydney with alarm, saying they don't want to make the same mistakes by waiting too long to impose strict measures.Health officials said genome testing would not verify until Wednesday whether the infected 58-year-old man had the delta variant, although they were working under the assumption he does.Officials said they could not immediately find a connection between the man and the handful of people who have tested positive while isolating in quarantine after arriving from abroad. The border is seen as the most likely source of any outbreaks.The move into the strictest lockdown underscored the vastly different approach New Zealand has taken to the virus than most other nations, which are attempting to suppress its spread rather than eliminate it entirely.New Zealand has reported just 26 virus deaths since the pandemic began.The lockdown takes effect from just before midnight Tuesday. It requires people to remain at home and avoid others. Most people can leave only to buy groceries or exercise. The nation's vaccination program had been accelerating but has been suspended for two days due to the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-to-enter-lockdown-after-single-virus-case-found-101629199613006.html

It resents any official ties between Taipei and other countries, arguing that such relations violate the “one China” policy.Beijing believes Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has a separatist bent on a formal declaration of independence with the support of the US.Earlier this month, Beijing lashed out at Washington after it finalised the sale of 40 medium self-propelled howitzer artillery systems to Taiwan in a deal valued at $750 million.Beijing will take legitimate and necessary counter-measures in light of the development of the situation, the Chinese foreign ministry said.On Tuesday’s development, the PLA’s ETA said in a statement the deployment was carried out with “joint fire assault and other drills using actual troops”.“Recently, the US and Taiwan have repeatedly provoked and sent serious wrong signals, severely infringed upon China’s sovereignty and severely undermined the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait, which has become the biggest source of security risks across the Taiwan Strait,” the command spokesperson Shi Yi said.“This exercise is a necessary action based on the current security situation across the Taiwan Strait and the need to safeguard national sovereignty,” he added.Taiwan’s defence ministry, according to Reuters news agency, gave a short response, saying, “The nation’s military has a full grasp and has made a full assessment of the situation in the Taiwan Strait region, as well as related developments at sea and in the air, and is prepared for various responses.”Tuesday’s drills took place days after the ETC carried out combat exercises in the Taiwan Straits and surrounding waters to verify and boost its inter-service joint operation capability.Units from multiple services took part in the exercises in the straits, including their northern and southern ends, senior colonel Zhang Chunhui, the command’s spokesman, said in a statement published last week.China Daily quoted Zhang as saying that they were “a necessary move responding to the current security situation in the Taiwan Straits and were meant to safeguard national sovereignty”.The statement did not use a description often employed to describe such operations - “a routine exercise included in the PLA’s annual training plan”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-launches-integrated-assault-drills-near-taiwan-101629199474050.html

Steinmeier said Germany is duty-bound to "do everything it can to bring our people, and all Afghans who stood for years by their side, to safety".It will also extend help to those in Afghanistan who are at risk, including "many courageous women", said Steinmeier, who was previously foreign minister."The failure of the years-long efforts to build a stable and viable society in Afghanistan raises fundamental questions for the past and future of our foreign policy and military engagement," he said.Also read | Taliban were ‘catching and killing us’: Afghan intel officer who fled to Delhi on last flight from KabulGerman forces were deployed for almost two decades in Afghanistan as part of the US-led NATO operation.The 150,000 men and women sent by Germany at various points over the years made it the second biggest contributor of NATO troops there, after the United States.Germany withdrew its last troops at the end of June following Washington's decision to leave the country.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-temporarily-halts-development-aid-for-afghanistan-evacuation-continues-101629197989018.html

Another video, that went viral on social media, showed insurgents riding play horses in a merry-go-round and talking animatedly among themselves.It seems all they wanted was free rides at the theme park #Taliban pic.twitter.com/qh00uk96UKThe Taliban took control of the presidential palace in Kabul on Sunday hours after President Ashraf Ghani fled Afghanistan, reportedly for a central Asian nation, literally establishing its rule in the embattled country two decades after they were ousted by the US military.Monday's scenes from an amusement park in Kabul were in sharp and ironic contrast to chaotic visuals that surfaced from the city's international airport, where thousands of panic-stricken Afghans gathered in a desperate attempt to leave the country, even as the administration shut the civilian airspace over Afghanistan.Horrific videos widely circulated in media showed people running on the tarmac while some clung to the undercarriage of a US military aircraft as it taxied on the runway. Local media reported that at least three people fell to their death trying to escape as stowaways in a C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft of the US air force.ALSO READ | Taliban take control of Afghanistan: Why the country's army melted awayThe chaos at the runway, now under the control of the US troops, prompted a temporary halt in the evacuation process, only to resume early on Tuesday to ferry diplomats and civilians.Even as the Taliban said no one would be “harmed”, and declared an "amnesty" across the country, urging women to join their "government", thousands of people are desperate to flee the country as many Afghans were apprehensive of the Taliban rule and a return of the draconian practices. During the Taliban's previous rule between 1996 and 2001, women could not work and kangaroo courts meted out ‘punishments’ such as public stoning, whipping and hanging.On Monday, the UN Secretary-General António Guterres urged the Taliban to exercise utmost restraint to protect lives and called on the UN Security Council to use all tools at its disposal to suppress global terrorist threats in Afghanistan and ensure human rights are not violated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-taliban-armed-fighters-kabul-amusement-park-takeover-101629191931610.html
17-08-2021||World||Chinese ports choke over 'zero tolerance' Covid-19 policy||Several Chinese ports are facing congestion as vessels due to call at Ningbo are bing diverted and cargo processing is slowed partly due to stricter disinfection measures under China's "zero-tolerance" coronavirus policy.On Tuesday, more than 50 container vessels were queuing at Ningbo port, China's second largest marine centre, Refinitiv data showed, up from 28 on Aug. 10 when a Covid-19 case was reported at one of its terminals.Leading international shipping groups have warned their clients of delays and route adjustments. At least 14 vessels operated by CMA CGM, five Maersk vessels and four Hapag-Lloyd ships have decided to skip Ningbo, while dozens of vessels are adjusting their schedules, the shipping groups said.China's economy is losing momentum as a result of new coronavirus restrictions and global supply chains face further strains with the curbs adding to queues at major Chinese transportation hubs, already stretched by a resurgence of consumer spending, shortage of container ships and logjams at ports.China's Ministry of Transportation has ordered all ports to have special teams to deal with foreign vessels and required their crews to have health certificates or negative tests before allowing them to load and discharge cargos.Ports also have their own rules, with some applying additional precautions to vessels that stopped at ports in high-risk regions, such as India, Laos or Russia, in the past 21 days."China's zero tolerance policy is good for the pandemic but bad for the supply chain," said Dawn Tiura, chief executive officer of Sourcing Industry Group, a U.S.-based association for the sourcing and procurement industry. "This timing is very tough considering the uptick in back-to-school and return-to-work shopping in addition to the upcoming holiday shopping season."Ningbo Zhoushan Port Co said in a statement late on Monday its handling volume has resumed to about 90% of its average daily level in July, following efforts to mitigate the impact of the shutdown of a terminal, which accounts for about 20% of Ningbo's container handling capacity, after a COVID-19 case was detected there last week.Vessels scheduled to call at the terminal are being re-routed to nearby ports. Shanghai port had 34 vessels waiting at anchorage, compared to 27 on Aug. 10, while the number of vessels waiting at Xiamen port - 700 km south of Ningbo - rose to 18 on Tuesday from four early last week."Cargoes have been piling up at port recently due to tight labour force from portside and relevant departments, while increasing shipments also weighed," said a bulk ship operator at China's eastern port city Lianyungang."China is an important component of the global supply chain ... Any shutdowns or delays from China have the potential to delay finished goods two or three tiers out," said Richard Lebovitz, chief executive officer of LeanDNA, a U.S-based supply chain consultancy.The Freightos Baltic Global Container Index (FBX), a weighted average of 12 major global container routes, hit a record high of 9,770 per forty-foot equivalent (FEU) container this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-ports-choke-over-zero-tolerance-covid-19-policy-101629195935949.html

He added that Ankara would continue talks with the US and other allies over the security of Kabul airport and the transition of power in Afghanistan.In a desperate attempt to leave Afghanistan, thousands of people have been thronging Kabul airport, leading to a chaotic situation. On Monday, the United States said that it would deploy 6,000 of its troops to ensure the safe departure of its citizens and allies from Afghanistan. Turkey assured that evacuation flights would continue as the airport was secured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-welcomes-positive-messages-from-taliban-after-amnesty-announcement-101629190042892.html
17-08-2021||World||Taliban announces 'amnesty' across Afghanistan, urges women to join govt||The Taliban declared an “amnesty” across Afghanistan and urged women to join its government Tuesday, trying to calm nerves across a tense capital city that only the day before saw chaos at its airport as people tried to flee their rule.The comments by Enamullah Samangani, a member of the Taliban's cultural commission, represent the first comments on governance from a federal level across the country after their blitz across the country.While there were no major reports of abuses or fighting in Kabul, many residents have stayed home and remain fearful after the insurgents’ takeover saw prisons emptied and armories looted. Older generations remember their ultraconservative Islamic views, which included stonings, amputations and public executions during their rule before the US-led invasion that followed the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks.“The Islamic Emirate doesn't want women to be victims” Samangani said, using the militants' term for Afghanistan. “They should be in government structure according to Shariah law.”He added: “The structure of government is not fully clear, but based on experience, there should be a fully Islamic leadership and all sides should join.”Samangani remained vague on other details, however, implying people already knew the rules of Islamic law the Taliban expected them to follow."Our people are Muslims and we are not here to force them to Islam,” he said.Under the Taliban, which ruled in accordance with a harsh interpretation of Islamic law, women were largely confined to their homes. The insurgents have sought to project greater moderation in recent years, but many Afghans remain skeptical.Meanwhile Tuesday, Stefano Pontecorvo, NATO's senior civilian representative to Afghanistan, posted video online showing the runway empty with American troops on the tarmac. What appeared to be a military cargo plane could be seen in the distance from behind a chain-link fence in the footage.The runway "is open,” he wrote on Twitter. “I see airplanes landing and taking off.”Overnight, flight-tracking data showed a US Marine Corps KC-130J Hercules plane at the airport and later taking off for Qatar, home to Al-Udeid Air Base and the U.S. military Central Command's forward headquarters.The German Foreign Ministry meanwhile said a first German military transport plane has landed in Kabul, but it could only take seven people on board before it had to depart again.“Because of the chaotic conditions at the airport and regular exchanges of fire at the access point last night, it was not possible for further German citizens and other people who need to be evacuated to come to the airport without protection from the German army," the ministry said.A special military flight with some 120 Indian officials separately landed in the western state of Gujarat after taking off from Kabul’s main airport on Tuesday, the Press Trust of India and state TV reported. Another flight made it off the ground Monday as well.Sweden’ s Foreign Minister Ann Linde wrote on Twitter on Tuesday that the staff from the Swedish Embassy in Kabul had returned to Sweden.On Monday, thousands of Afghans rushed into Kabul’s main airport, some so desperate to escape the Taliban that they held onto a military jet as it took off and plunged to their deaths. At least seven people died in the chaos, US officials saidAcross Afghanistan, the International Committee of the Red Cross said thousands had been wounded in the fighting. Security forces and politicians handed over their provinces and bases without a fight, likely believing the two-decade Western experiment to remake Afghanistan would not survive the resurgent Taliban. The last American troops had planned to withdraw at the end of the month.“The world is following events in Afghanistan with a heavy heart and deep disquiet about what lies ahead,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said.A resolute US President Joe Biden on Monday said he stood “squarely behind” his decision to withdraw American forces and acknowledged the “gut-wrenching” images unfolding in Kabul. Biden said he faced a choice between honoring a previously negotiated withdrawal agreement or sending thousands more troops back to begin a third decade of war.“After 20 years, I’ve learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw US forces,” Biden said in a televised address from the White House.Talks appeared to be continuing between the Taliban and several Afghan government officials, including former President Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, who once headed the country’s negotiating council. President Ashraf Ghani earlier fled the country amid the Taliban advance and his whereabouts remain unknown.An official with direct knowledge of the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity as he wasn't authorized to brief journalists, said senior Taliban leader Amir Khan Muttaqi had arrived in Kabul from Qatar. Muttaqi is a former higher education minister during the Taliban's last rule. Muttaqi had begun making contact with Afghan political leaders even before Ghani fled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-announces-amnesty-across-afghanistan-urges-women-to-join-govt-101629188080377.html

The police have detained the man who carried out the act.This is the third time that the Maharaja's statue, located in high security Lahore Fort complex, has been vandalised.Watch video below:The nine-feet statue, made of cold bronze, was unveiled at the Lahore Fort in June 2019 to mark the 180th death anniversary of the Maharaja. Singh, the first Maharaja of the Sikh Empire, ruled over Punjab for close to 40 years. He died in 1839.The statue shows the regal Maharaja Ranjit Singh sitting on a horse, sword in hand, complete in Sikh attire.Just two months after its unveiling, the statue was vandalised by two members of Tehreek-e-Labbaik. Both the men were arrested by the police. They entered the fort as a disabled person and his helper. The man who pretended to have a leg disability hit the statue with the rod he was carrying while the second person helped him. One of the arms of the statue and other parts were broken in the attack.The police said that the attackers were of the view that it's against their religion to erect a statue of a Sikh ruler in a Muslim country.It took eight months to complete the statue of the Sikh ruler sitting on his favourite horse named Kahar Bahar with a sword in hand. The horse was a gift from Dost Muhammad Khan, the founder of the Barazkai dynasty.The statue was built and installed by the Walled City of Lahore Authority (WCLA) in collaboration with the UK-based Sikh Heritage Foundation, which funded the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maharaja-ranjit-singh-s-statue-vandalised-in-pakistan-1-detained-101629185755329.html

17-08-2021||World||Khairullah Khairkhwa, part of 'Gitmo 5' released in 2014, planned Taliban's return: Report||A Taliban prisoner who was released from the Guantanamo Bay prison in 2014 by former US president Barack Obama, is emerging as the key figure who reunited the insurgents and helped them capture the power in Afghanistan. Khairullah Khairkhwa was released along with four others in exchange for captured US Army soldier, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.Others released along with Khairkhwa were Mohammed Nabi, who served as chief of security for the Taliban in Qalat; Mohammad Fazl, who according to Human Rights Watch allegedly presided over the mass killing of Shiite Muslims in Afghanistan in 2000 and 2001; Abdul Haq Wasiq, who served as the Taliban deputy minister of intelligence and Mullah Norullah Nori, who was a senior Taliban commander in Mazar-e-Sharif in 2001.Also Read: Afghan war cost US $2 trillion, interest will pinch every AmericanThe 'Gitmo Five' were labelled "hardest of the hardcore" by US intelligence officials who urged Obama to reconsider his decision. However, those warnings were ignored, with assurance that these five terrorists will be kept in Qatar, so that they are not able to indulge in active politics in Afghanistan.But now, a report the New York Post has claimed that Khairkhwa and the four others released along with him made contact with active Taliban terrorists and vowed to drive American troops out of the country which they ruled 20 years ago. Khairkhwa played a key role in formation of a Taliban regime in exile and became official negotiator for peace talks, the Post report said.In the negotiations that followed with the western countries, Khairkhwa discussed the terms with US President Joe Biden's envoy to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, at a conference in Moscow. However, the team refused to promise they would not launch a spring offensive despite calls from the United States, Russia and China.Al Jazeera has now quoted Taliban fighters to report that Khairkhwa, along with the other members of its regime in exile, will be brought back to Afghanistan.Washington has been at war in Afghanistan for nearly two decades, since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks masterminded by al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden who was based in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. The invasion toppled the Taliban regime, but they never left.As soon as the withdrawal of US forces was announced, the Taliban stepped up their efforts to capture Afghanistan and launched an offensive against the western-trained forces. They started capturing territories at a stunning pace, and completely seized power in Afghanistan on Sunday - two weeks before the US was set to complete its troop withdrawal.President Biden acknowledged on Monday that the collapse of the Afghan government occurred much faster than his administration expected.The president said in remarks at the White House, “The truth is this did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated.” Yet, the president said that the rapid end of the Afghan government only vindicates his choice to end the war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-khairullah-khairkhwa-released-from-guantanamo-bay-planned-taliban-s-return-101629182398683.html

Maxar Technologies recently shared satellite images from Hamid Karzai International Airport in the capital city of Kabul, which showed the desperation of Afghan nationals to flee from their home country.As international governments started airlifting their officials, thousands of people thronged the Kabul airport to break free from the Islamist hardline organisation's rule. Amid the chaos, two armed men at the airport were killed by US soldiers, a Pentagon official said.On Monday, visuals showed that some desperate Afghan nationals held on to a US military aircraft and plunged to their deaths as it took off. At least three people fell off when the aircraft was mid-air and landed straight onto the rooftops of houses and lost their lives. American military officials, on the condition of anonymity, told the Associated Press that seven people have died at the Kabul airport incident so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-crisis-satellite-images-reveal-the-chaos-at-kabul-airport-101629183204483.html

On this day, people also remember those who lost their lives working for humanitarian causes.World Humanitarian Day also marks the day on which the then Special Representative of the secretary-general to Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello, and 21 aid workers were killed in the bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad on August 19, 2003. Five years later, the General Assembly adopted a resolution designating August 19 as World Humanitarian Day.Every year, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs decides on a theme to encourage people to raise awareness about a prevailing crisis. This year, the world body is focussing on the climate crisis and its immediate human cost. With this, it aims to increase pressure on world leaders to take meaningful steps against climate change and save the world’s most vulnerable people."With most climate campaigns focused on slowing climate change and securing the planet’s future, World Humanitarian Day 2021 will highlight the immediate human cost of the climate crisis and pressure world leaders to take meaningful climate action for the world’s most vulnerable people," the UN said in the statement on its website.The UN also highlighted that the climate emergency is wreaking havoc across the world at a scale that the humanitarian community and people working at the forefront of the issue cannot manage. "Time is already running out for millions of the world's most vulnerable people – those who have contributed least to the global climate emergency but are hit the hardest," it also stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-humanitarian-day-2021-history-theme-and-why-it-is-observed-101629182651199.html
17-08-2021||World||Can't forgive him: Afghan central bank chief blames Ghani for chaos, flees Kabul||The head of Afghanistan's central bank has fled Kabul, questioned the loyalty of Afghan security forces and blamed President Ashraf Ghani and his inexperienced advisors for the country's swift and chaotic fall to the Taliban.In a Twitter thread on Monday detailing how he worked at the bank until militants were at the gates of the city, Acting Governor Ajmal Ahmady also said that US dollar supplies were dwindling and described escaping the capital on a military flight."On Sunday I began work. Reports throughout morning were increasingly worrisome. I left the bank and left deputies in charge. Felt terrible about leaving staff," he said."It did not have to end this way. I am disgusted by the lack of any planning by Afghan leadership. Saw at airport them leave without informing others,"Ghani fled Afghanistan on Sunday as Taliban militants entered Kabul virtually unopposed.Their arrival, barely a week after they captured faraway provincial capital Zaranj, was disorienting, said Ahmady, 43.He was appointed acting governor of Afghanistan's central bank just over a year ago, having previously worked at the US Treasury, the World Bank and in private equity, according to a short biography posted on a government website."Seems difficult to believe, but there remains a suspicion as to why (Afghan National Security Forces) left posts so quickly," Ahmady said, referring to claims by some pro-government militia leaders of that the army's capitulation in northern Afghanistan was the result of a conspiracy."There is something left unexplained."Ahmady did not respond to Reuters' emails and messages seeking comment. His remarks were posted from his verified Twitter account. A World Bank source who has been in correspondence with Ahmady said the account was genuine.As the Taliban advanced, Ahmady said Afghanistan's currency markets were in a panic, especially after the central bank on Friday was told it would not receive any more dollars, driving the price of Afghanistan's currency, the Afghani, sharply lower."I held meetings on Saturday to reassure banks and money exchangers to calm them down. I can't believe that was one day before Kabul fell," Ahmady said. He said the currency dropped as far as 100 to the dollar, a fall of about 23%, before stabilising at 86.Ahmady said he boarded a military aircraft amid chaos on the tarmac after a commercial flight he booked was swamped with passengers. It was unclear which military plane he boarded and he did not mention his destination."There was a rush. Some shots were fired. Somehow, my close colleagues pushed me on board," he said. Ghani's lack of planning and failure to recognise the shortcomings of his advisers were the government's undoing, Ahmady said."Once president’s departure was announced, I knew within minutes chaos would follow. I cannot forgive him for creating that without a transition plan."He himself had great ideas but poor execution. If I contributed to that, I take my share of the blame."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cant-forgive-him-afghan-central-bank-chief-blames-ghani-for-chaos-flees-kabul-101629181690641.html

And it took them just a month to defeat the Western-backed forces of Afghanistan and take control of the country again after 20 years.The turnaround happened in the wake of the pullout of United States forces from Afghanistan - its longest combat mission till date. The US forces remained in Afghanistan for about two decades - since 9/11 - and have spent trillions of dollars but all that came to naught in front of Taliban blitzkrieg.And because the US borrowed most of the money to pay for it, generations of Americans will be burdened by the cost of paying it off.Take a look at US-led war in Afghanistan, by the numbers:According to estimates by Costs of War Project at Brown University, United States has spent more than $2 trillion on the war in Afghanistan. This includes the direct funding cost of $800 billion and $83 billion to train the Afghan army.To put the figures in perspective, the amount spent in keeping Taliban at bay is more than the combined net worth of Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Bill Gates and the 30 richest billionaires in America.The Brown University has also made the projection that the cost of interest on the United States' Afghan war debt will go up to $6.5 trillion by 2050. And that will pinch the average American, since it translates to $20,000 for each and every US citizen.The cost is even greater in terms of lives lost. The US lost 2,448 of its service members (figures till April this year) while fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan, and nearly 4,000 civilian contractors. More than 66,000 Afghan national military and police personnel have also been killed in the last 20 years.The civilian cost too is very high - 47,245. The number of Taliban and other opposition fighters killed in the war stands at 51,191, according to university figures.The US has also committed a substantial amount in health care, disability, burial and other costs for roughly 4 million Afghanistan and Iraq veterans. That amount will peak after 2048.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-war-cost-us-2-trillion-interest-will-pinch-every-american-101629179737345.html
17-08-2021||World||Kabul streets turn silent a day after chaos; evacuations continue||Afghanistan plunged into a crisis after the Taliban seized control of the South Asian nation in a military takeover over the last few weeks. The group took advantage of the troops' pullout from the country by the United States and Nato, and the meltdown by the Afghan forces and its government. On Sunday, the group captured the capital city of Kabul and entered the presidential palace even as President Ashraf Ghan fled the country.As panic gripped the country, residents, fearing a repeat of the Taliban's brutal Islamist rule from 1996 to 2001, thronged the Kabul airport in a desperate attempt to escape. On Monday, thousands of Afghans stormed into the Hamid Karzai International Airport and some even clung onto the planes. At least two people lost their lives as they lost their grip and fell afterthe plane took off.Here are the latest developments of the crisis:Situation in KabulA day after the chaotic scenes at the Kabul airport, the number of civilians had thinned out, news agency Reuters reported quoting a security official at the facility. Military flights evacuating diplomats and civilians from Afghanistan have also been resumed early on Tuesday after the runway was cleared of the crowd.Occasional shots are also being heard from the direction of the airport, while other streets of the city remained mostly calm as against the panic and confusion scenes of yesterday.Defiant BidenUS President Joe Biden who is facing flak for abandoning Afghanistan and sparking a major humanitarian crisis in the country rejected blame for the chaos and said, "I stand squarely behind my decision."Biden also acknowledged the Afghan collapse played out far more quickly than the most forecasts of his administration. “This did unfold more quickly than we anticipated," he said in a statement from the White House.The president further placed the blame on Afghan and said he warned Ghani — who was appointed Afghanistan's president in a US-negotiated agreement — to be prepared to fight a civil war with the Taliban after American forces leave the country. "They failed to do any of that," Biden also said.EvacuationsThe US has evacuated its embassy and most of the staff. It is now working to evacuate the rest of the citizens and Afghan staff that was working for them for years.India is also evacuating its diplomats and other staff in the Indian Air Force's C17 aircraft. Indian ambassador to Afghanistan Rudrendra Tandon is on the flight along with 120 other diplomats and officials who were evacuated on Tuesday.The Indian government has also announced a provision of electronic visas to fast-track applications for those who wish to leave Afghanistan and want to come to Pakistan. The government launched "e-Emergency X-Misc Visa" on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabul-streets-turn-silent-a-day-after-chaos-evacuations-continue-101629179380891.html
17-08-2021||World||Taliban seizure of Kabul sparks frenetic global diplomacy||With Pakistan-backed ultra-conservative Taliban seizing Kabul by force on August 15, there is frenetic diplomacy among major powers with US secretary of state Antony Blinken talking to his Chinese and Russian counterparts to find a way forward to stem the present chaos in Afghanistan. It is quite evident that China and Russia have cut a deal with the Taliban in exchange for recognition as the legitimate ruler of Afghanistan. The two powers apparently cut a deal with the help of Pakistan on the assurance that there will be no support for Uighur militants in Afghanistan and no intrusion or Taliban jihad into Central Asian republics bordering Afghanistan.However, the Taliban victory will not be complete till such time Ahmad Shah Massoud's son, Ahmad Massoud, and formidable former Afghan VP Amrulleh Saleh are building resistance in Panjshir Valley. Panjshir Valley that links Afghanistan to Xinjiang via the Wakhan corridor has never been occupied by either the invading Soviets in the 1970s or the Taliban in the 1990s.Blinken also spoke on Monday with counterparts in India, Pakistan, Russia, Britain, the European Union, Turkey and Nato about ensuring regional stability, the State Department said.Also read | EXCLUSIVE: India evacuates second batch of diplomats, officials from AfghanistanChinese foreign minister Wang Yi told Blinken that the hasty pullout of American troops had a "serious negative impact", China's state broadcaster CCTV reported, adding that Wang pledged to work with Washington to promote stability.As there was panic and confusion in Kabul, US President Joe Biden defended his country's decision to withdraw American forces after 20 years of war. Biden insisted he had to decide between asking US forces to fight endlessly in what he called Afghanistan's civil war or follow through on an agreement to depart negotiated by Republican former president Donald Trump."I stand squarely behind my decision. After 20 years I have learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw US forces. That's why we're still there," Biden, who has been facing a barrage of criticism, said. He also blamed the Taliban's takeover on Afghan political leaders who fled the country and the Afghan army's unwillingness to fight.Also read | Taliban take control of Afghanistan: Why the country's army melted awayAfter a day of chaos at Kabul airport, military flights evacuating diplomats and civilians from Afghanistan restarted early on Tuesday after the runway at Kabul airport was cleared of thousands of people desperate to flee after the Taliban seized the capital. Ten Afghan civilians have been killed so far at the Kabul airport amid the ensuing chaos, but it was not clear whether they had been shot or crushed in a stampede. Meanwhile, several reports indicated that there is no aviation fuel left at the Airport.Also watch | Akhundzada, Haqqani, Baradar: Meet the Taliban leaders running AfghanistanThe Taliban are also holding internal consultations on formulating new governance set up in Afghanistan.

He was also a member of a famous South Korean pop band before returning to China a few years ago.The prosecutor’s office of the Beijing district of Chaoyang was quoted in the Chinese state media as saying in a statement that Wu’s arrest was formally approved on Monday.The court gave no details of the charges or the sentencing.Chinese state media has said that Wu, whose Chinese name is Wu Yifan, could be jailed for 10 years. In China, rape usually carries a sentence between three to 10 years of imprisonment.Wu grew up in Guangzhou in south China and in Vancouver, Canada. Police have said he is a Canadian citizen.Wu, one of China’s biggest stars, faces a series of sexual abuse accusations from a 19-year-old student identified as Du Meizhu.Wu, 30, had earlier denied the accusation by a teenager that he had sex with her while she was drunk.Du’s allegations emerged in July on Chinese social media platform Weibo, when she alleged that Wu had sexually assaulted her while she was drunk at his home where she said she had gone for a casting interview.Du said she was 17 at the time. In China, the age of consent is 14.“Du previously revealed to the media that Wu used various methods to identify and lure young girls for sex. Du claimed that the number of victims, including herself, far exceeds eight, among whom two are minors,” The Global Times reported, quoting Du.Du said that she had returned Wu the hush money, about 500,000 yuan ($77,166), in installments and was ready to go through legal procedures, the report said.Global luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton, Porsche and several Chinese ones severed ties with Wu soon after the allegations emerged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prominent-chinese-canadian-pop-star-kris-wu-arrested-for-allegedly-raping-teen-101629177751779.html
17-08-2021||World||Malaysia's king to meet political leaders to find new PM||Malaysia’s king is set Tuesday to meet the heads of political parties as he swiftly began the task of finding a new prime minister amid a worsening coronavirus pandemic.The resignation Monday of Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin after less than 18 months in office followed mounting public anger over what was widely perceived as his government’s poor handling of the pandemic. Malaysia has one of the world’s highest infection rates and deaths per capita, with daily cases breaching 20,000 this month despite a seven-month state of emergency and a lockdown since June.The monarch has ruled out a general election as many parts of the country are Covid-19 red zones and health facilities are inadequate.Muhyiddin was appointed caretaker prime minister until a successor is found.Local media said Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah has summoned party leaders to the palace later Tuesday, all believed to be at the same time. This included parties formerly in Muhyiddin’s government as well as the opposition.The king plays a largely ceremonial role but he appoints the person he believes has majority support of Parliament to be prime minister.Muhyiddin took power in March 2020 after initiating the collapse of the reformist government that won 2018 elections. With a razor-thin majority in Parliament and an unstable coalition, he held office less than 18 months, making him the country’s shortest-ruling leader.Before choosing Muhyiddin, Sultan Abdullah interviewed all 222 lawmakers individually then sought nominations from party leaders in an arduous selection process. His choice of Muhyiddin as the prime minister was disputed by the predecessor he ousted, Mahathir Mohamad, and the opposition.An official from Mahathir's party confirmed it has been invited to the meeting Tuesday.The selection this time will be another tough chore for the monarch because no coalition can claim a majority. The three-party alliance that is the biggest opposition bloc has nominated its leader, Anwar Ibrahim. But the bloc has less than 90 lawmakers, short of the 111 needed for a simple majority. That’s also less than the 100 lawmakers believed to have backed Muhyiddin.Other contenders include former Deputy Prime Minister Ismail who is from the United Malays National Organization, the biggest party in Muhyiddin’s alliance.Local media said another possible candidate is Razaleigh Hamzah, an 84-year-old prince who was a former finance minister. Razaleigh, an UMNO lawmaker, is seen as a neutral candidate who could unite the warring factions in UMNO.A leader from eastern Sabah state on Borneo island, Shafie Apdal, has also been named in the race. It is unlikely as his party only has 8 lawmakers but some say a leader from Borneo may be seen as acceptable to all.But Mahathir, 96, has called for a national recovery council to be formed and led mainly by professionals to resolve the country’s economic and health crises.The Bersih electoral reform group urged contenders to pursue political stability by offering multi-partisan governance and institutional reforms, and not just horse-trading over numbers and positions.“The endless political machination due to winner-takes-all politics in a de facto hung parliament for the past one and a half year must now end to enable a more effective governance of health and economy. The new Prime Minister must quickly convene a special meeting and table a motion of confidence in himself to prove his majority,” it said in a statement.It warned that a short-sighted and self-serving government would be punished by voters in the next election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysias-king-to-meet-political-leaders-to-find-new-pm-101629176913107.html
17-08-2021||World||Taliban take control of Afghanistan: Why the country's army melted away||Afghanistan has been plunged into chaos after Taliban took over in the wake of pullout of American forces from the country. While Afghans living outside the country are angry at world community for "abandoning" them, much of that anger is directed towards the United States.EXCLUSIVE: India evacuates second batch of diplomats, officials from AfghanistanThe Biden administration has been accused by many, like former US ambassador to Afghanistan Ronald Neumann, of giving a "profound shock" to the Afghan army and morale by pulling out. Many Afghans were seen clinging to US military planes in Kabul on Monday in a desperate bid to flee their home country after the Taliban's easy victory over an Afghan military.Akhundzada, Haqqani, Baradar: Meet the Taliban leaders running AfghanistanAmerica and Nato allies had spent two decades trying to build the army, but it easily melted away. Here's a look at what really went wrong:Dollars down the drainWashington spent $83 billion to create a modern army. It meant huge dependence on high-tech communications where 30% of the population can count on reliable power supply. The Afghans, many of them illiterate in a country lacking infrastructure to support cutting-edge military equipment, failed to mount a resistance against an outnumbered foe.Inflated numbersFor months on end, the Pentagon had said there was a numerical advantage held by the Afghan forces - supposedly with 300,000 men in the army and the police - over the Taliban, estimated to number some 70,000. But those army numbers were inflated.As of July 2020, the 300,000 included only 1,85,000 troops or special operations forces, with police and other security personnel making up the rest. And barely 60 per cent of the troops were trained fighters.Unpaid and unfedThe salaries of the Afghan army were paid for years by the Pentagon. But from the time the US army announced its withdrawal, responsibility for payments fell on the Kabul government. Afghan soldiers complained they not only were unpaid for months, in many instances, their units were no longer getting food supplies and ammunition.Illusory promisesUS officials have vowed they will support the Afghan national army after August 31 - the date for completing the withdrawal of American forces - but they have never explained how this would be done. In May, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said help would be provided from afar through "over the horizon" logistics. That vague concept implied the use of virtual training sessions with video conferencing on the Zoom platform - an approach that seems illusory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-take-control-of-afghanistan-why-the-country-s-army-melted-away-101629176790783.html

The state of emergency could be extended till September 12, according to officials.The emergency measures have already been imposed in Tokyo, Osaka, Okinawa and three other regions and were supposed to end by August 31. And now, the number of regions under restrictions has climbed to 13.The above measures include banning restaurants and bars from selling alcohol and instructing them to close at 8pm. The government is also expected to ask shopping malls and departmental stores to limit the number of customers inside their premises at one point in time.“(Infection) is spreading across Japan on a scale we have never experienced before,” Yasutoshi Nishimura, Japan’s Covid-19 response minister, told an expert panel on Tuesday, adding the number of critical patients is rising with each passing day.Even though Japan has a smaller Covid-19 outbreak compared to other countries, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga-led government is finding it difficult to curb the spread of the viral disease fuelled by the Delta variant.According to news agency Bloomberg, the emergency measures are having very little effect on citizens. Despite the threat of fines, bars and restaurants are not closing on time and are still selling alcohol. People are stepping out of their homes unnecessarily and no penalties have been imposed by government authorities yet.Prime Minister Suga has ruled out the possibility of a mandatory lockdown and said he is relying on the vaccination rollout to improve the situation. Bloomberg further reported that a little over 37 per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated till Monday and the government is planning to administer vaccines to all those citizens who want it by November.Japan recently concluded the 2020 Olympics in the capital city of Tokyo amid the pandemic, considered by many as the most challenging Olympic journey.

The quake nearly wrecked some towns in the southwest in the latest disaster to befall the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation.Haitians already were struggling with the coronavirus pandemic, gang violence, worsening poverty and the July 7 assassination of President Jovenel Moise.What makes Haiti prone to quakes?Earthquakes occur when tectonic plates in the Earth's crust move. Haiti sits near the intersection of two of them - the North American plate and the Caribbean plate.Officials said the magnitude 7.2 earthquake left more than 7,000 homes destroyed and nearly 5,000 damaged. Some 30,000 families have been left homeless.The buildings in the country are designed to withstand hurricanes, not earthquakes.What was the epicentre of Saturday's earthquake?The quake that hit Haiti was centred 125km west of the capital Port-au-Prince. Hospitals, schools, offices and churches were destroyed or badly damaged.This year's quake was stronger than the one that hit the country in 2010, but hit a less densely populated area.PM declares emergencyHaiti's Prime Minister Ariel Henry declared a one-month state of emergency for the whole country and said the first government aid convoys had started moving help to areas where towns were destroyed and hospitals were overwhelmed."We must work together to provide rapid and effective responses to this extremely serious situation," Henry said on Sunday.UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said humanitarian needs were acute, with many Haitians urgently needing healthcare, clean water and shelter. Children separated from their parents also needed protection, she said.The 2010 earthquakeHaiti was struck by a 7.0 earthquake in January, 2010, which left more than 2,00,000 dead and Port-au-Prince and nearby cities in ruins.More than 1.5 million Haitians were made homeless and 60 per cent of the country's healthcare system was destroyed.In 2010, it had been more than a century since the last major earthquake had struck.

17-08-2021||World||Billions spent by US on Afghan army ultimately benefited Taliban||Built and trained at a two-decade cost of $83 billion, Afghan security forces collapsed so quickly and completely — in some cases without a shot fired — that the ultimate beneficiary of the American investment turned out to be the Taliban. They grabbed not only political power but also US-supplied firepower — guns, ammunition, helicopters and more.The Taliban captured an array of modern military equipment when they overran Afghan forces who failed to defend district centers. Bigger gains followed, including combat aircraft, when the Taliban rolled up provincial capitals and military bases with stunning speed, topped by capturing the biggest prize, Kabul, over the weekend.A US defence official on Monday confirmed the Taliban's sudden accumulation of US-supplied Afghan equipment is enormous. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and so spoke on condition of anonymity. The reversal is an embarrassing consequence of misjudging the viability of Afghan government forces — by the US military as well as intelligence agencies — which in some cases chose to surrender their vehicles and weapons rather than fight.The US failure to produce a sustainable Afghan army and police force, and the reasons for their collapse, will be studied for years by military analysts. The basic dimensions, however, are clear and are not unlike what happened in Iraq. The forces turned out to be hollow, equipped with superior arms but largely missing the crucial ingredient of combat motivation.“Money can't buy will. You cannot purchase leadership,” John Kirby, chief spokesman for Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, said Monday.Doug Lute, a retired Army lieutenant general who help direct Afghan war strategy during the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations, said that what the Afghans received in tangible resources they lacked in the more important intangibles.“The principle of war stands — moral factors dominate material factors,” he said. “Morale, discipline, leadership, unit cohesion are more decisive than numbers of forces and equipment. As outsiders in Afghanistan, we can provide materiel, but only Afghans can provide the intangible moral factors.”By contrast, Afghanistan's Taliban insurgents, with smaller numbers, less sophisticated weaponry and no air power, proved a superior force. US intelligence agencies largely underestimated the scope of that superiority, and even after President Joe Biden announced in April he was withdrawing all US troops, the intelligence agencies did not foresee a Taliban final offensive that would succeed so spectacularly.“If we wouldn’t have used hope as a course of action, ... we would have realised the rapid drawdown of US forces sent a signal to the Afghan national forces that they were being abandoned,” said Chris Miller, who saw combat in Afghanistan in 2001 and was acting secretary of defence at the end of President Donald Trump’s term.Stephen Biddle, a professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University and a former adviser to US commanders in Afghanistan, said Biden's announcement set the final collapse in motion.“The problem of the US withdrawal is that it sent a nationwide signal that the jig is up — a sudden, nationwide signal that everyone read the same way,” Biddle said. Before April, the Afghan government troops were slowly but steadily losing the war, he said. When they learned that their American partners were going home, an impulse to give up without a fight “spread like wildfire.”The failures, however, go back much further and run much deeper. The United States tried to develop a credible Afghan defense establishment on the fly, even as it was fighting the Taliban, attempting to widen the political foundations of the government in Kabul and seeking to establish democracy in a country rife with corruption and cronyism.Year after year, US military leaders downplayed the problems and insisted success was coming. Others saw the handwriting on the wall. In 2015 a professor at the Army War College's Strategic Studies Institute wrote about the military's failure to learn lessons from past wars; he subtitled his book, “Why the Afghan National Security Forces Will Not Hold.”“Regarding the future of Afghanistan, in blunt terms, the United States has been down this road at the strategic level twice before, in Vietnam and Iraq, and there is no viable rationale for why the results will be any different in Afghanistan,” Chris Mason wrote. He added, presciently: “Slow decay is inevitable, and state failure is a matter of time.”Some elements of the Afghan army did fight hard, including commandos whose heroic efforts are yet to be fully documented. But as a whole the security forces created by the United States and its NATO allies amounted to a “house of cards” whose collapse was driven as much by failures of US civilian leaders as their military partners, according to Anthony Cordesman, a longtime Afghanistan war analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.The Afghan force-building exercise was so completely dependent on American largesse that the Pentagon even paid the Afghan troops' salaries. Too often that money, and untold amounts of fuel, were siphoned off by corrupt officers and government overseers who cooked the books, creating “ghost soldiers” to keep the misspent dollars coming.Of the approximately $145 billion the US government spent trying to rebuild Afghanistan, about $83 billion went to developing and sustaining its army and police forces, according to the Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a congressionally created watchdog that has tracked the war since 2008. The $145 billion is in addition to $837 billion the United States spent fighting the war, which began with an invasion in October 2001.The $83 billion invested in Afghan forces over 20 years is nearly double last year's budget for the entire US Marine Corps and is slightly more than what Washington budgeted last year for food stamp assistance for about 40 million Americans.In his book, “The Afghanistan Papers,” journalist Craig Whitlock wrote that US trainers tried to force Western ways on Afghan recruits and gave scant thought to whether US taxpayers dollars were investing in a truly viable army.“Given that the US war strategy depended on the Afghan army's performance, however, the Pentagon paid surprisingly little attention to the question of whether Afghans were willing to die for their government,” he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/billions-spent-by-us-on-afghan-army-ultimately-benefited-taliban-101629174326895.html

Within weeks, the Taliban swept from province to province until the group reached the presidential palace on Sunday, seizing power in the war-torn country.The stunning military takeover has triggered a massive panic across the capital with thousands of Afghans swarming to the airport in a desperate attempt to flee the country, fearing a repeat of the Taliban's brutal Islamist rule from 1996 to 2001.On Monday, dramatic footage posted on social media showed hundreds of men running alongside a US air force plane as it rolled down the runway, with some clinging to the side of it. In other videos, civilians frantically clambered up an already overcrowded and buckling jetway.President Ashraf Ghani fled as the Taliban reached Kabul on Sunday. Ghani left Afghanistan with the chief of staff, national security advisor and his family, as many on social media called him a coward and said they felt betrayed. However, Ghani said that he left to avoid further "bloodshed" in Afghanistan. As of now, it's not clear where he went.What is next for the war-torn country?The US and international community are piling pressure on the Taliban to reach some kind of deal with the Afghan government. This will likely lead to Ghani stepping down from his post or he will be moved to a figurehead role.The Taliban now control most of Afghanistan’s border crossings, which denies revenue for the government and enables the Taliban to tax trade to fund their fighting.The Taliban might also permit groups like al Qaeda to train and operate from there, which is likely to make the country hotbed of terrorist activities.Controlling the customs posts and border crossings (aside from Kabul airport) and with the Afghan military collapsing, the Taliban hold the cards. Russia and China will be comfortable engaging with the group’s leaders, according to experts.An exodus of people from Afghanistan could include terrorists and Uyghur separatists, worrying the neighbouring countries including Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan on the northern side.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/panic-grips-afghanistan-as-taliban-seizes-control-what-s-next-for-the-country-101629172652664.html
17-08-2021||World||Biden defends Afghan pull-out: ‘There was never a good time to withdraw forces’||US President Joe Biden on Monday defended his decision to pull his troops out of Afghanistan in the face of escalating criticism fuelled by heart-wrenching scenes of Afghan civilians trying to flee the country.“I stand squarely behind my decision. After 20 years, I’ve learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw US forces,” Biden said in an address to the nation from the White House on Monday in a brief return from vacation at the presidential retreat in the state of Maryland.Biden sought to explain the chaotic scenes and the speed of the Taliban takeover, which he admitted happened “more quickly than we had anticipated”.“So what’s happened? Afghanistan’s political leaders gave up and fled the country. The Afghan military collapsed, sometimes without trying to fight,” Biden said. “American troops cannot and should not be fighting in a war and dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves.”The American president has faced intense criticism in recent days as the Taliban rapidly took over Afghanistan emboldened by the withdrawal of US troops and precipitated a sense of desperation among Americans, allies and Afghan partners.Biden admitted being saddened by the events that have followed since, but, he said, “I do not regret my decision to end America’s war-fighting in Afghanistan.”Experts said the part of Biden’s speech that laid out his reasons for withdrawing from Afghanistan seemed familiar, as he has been vocal about it for years. In a nearly 19-minute speech from the East Room of the White House, Biden laid out his reasons, once again, for withdrawing American troops from Afghanistan, saying he has believed for long that the mission should have been to get the perpetrators of the 9/11 terror attacks and to let them never again use Afghanistan to launch another attack on the United States.The US president, who earlier sought to deflect blame for the Afghan debacle on the deal he inherited from former president Donald Trump, was scathing in his attack on Afghanistan’s leaders and the government forces.“We gave them every tool they could need. We paid their salaries, provided for the maintenance of their air force - something the Taliban doesn’t have,” the US president said as he defended his position. “When I hosted President [Ashraf] Ghani and chairman Abdullah [Abdullah] at the White House in June and again when I spoke by phone to Ghani in July, we had very frank conversations,” Biden said. “We talked about how Afghanistan should prepare to fight their civil wars after the US military departed, to clean up the corruption in government so the government could function for the Afghan people. We talked extensively about the need for Afghan leaders to unite politically.”“They failed to do any of that,” Biden said, and proceeded to further attack Afghan partners. “I also urged them to engage in diplomacy, to seek a political settlement with the Taliban. This advice was flatly refused. Mr. Ghani insisted the Afghan forces would fight, but obviously he was wrong.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-defends-afghan-pull-out-there-was-never-a-good-time-to-withdraw-forces-101629173071299.html

He was 69.A university dropout who worked in a printing company before founding Japan's first puzzle magazine, Kaji took hints from an existing number puzzle to create what he later named "sudoku" - a contraction of the Japanese for "every number must be single" - sometime in the mid-80s.The logic puzzle challenges people to fill a grid of 9X9 blocks, with nine boxes in each block so that all columns, both vertical and horizontal, contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition. The number of filled-in figures for a grid at the start of the puzzle determines how difficult it is."Known as the Godfather of Sudoku, he was adored by puzzle lovers around the world and we would like to express our gratitude to all of you," his company, Nikoli, said on its website on Monday.The cause of death was bile duct cancer.Sudoku became popular outside Japan around two decades ago after overseas newspapers began printing it. Praised as a way to keep mental faculties sharp, more than 100 million people around the world are estimated to try the puzzles regularly. A world championship has been held annually since 2006.Kaji continued to create and refine puzzles with the help of readers of his quarterly puzzle magazine. He stepped down as head of his company in July due to ill health and died on Aug. 10."I get really moved when I see a new idea for a puzzle which has lots of potential," he told the BBC in 2007, adding that the secret to inventing a good puzzle was to make the rules simple."It is like finding treasure. It's not about whether it will make money, it is purely the excitement of trying to solve it."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maki-kaji-the-godfather-of-sudoku-dies-at-69-101629166992978.html

"The situation is peaceful and good and everything has calmed down in the city. The situation in Kabul now under the Taliban is better than it was under (President) Ashraf Ghani," Zhirnov said while speaking to Moscow's Ekho Moskvy radio station, according to Reuters."Yesterday the regime fell like a house of cards. There was a feeling of disorder, a power vacuum, and looters came out on the streets," Zhirnov said, reported Reuters. Ghani fled on Sunday as the Taliban seized control of the country with lightning speed stunning countries across the world. The Afghan president said he left the country as he wanted to prevent bloodshed. There is no official confirmation of his whereabouts.Also read | India sets up Afghanistan cell to coordinate repatriation amid chaos in KabulRussia’s state news agency RIA Novosti reported that the Russian embassy in Kabul alleged on Monday that Ghani fled from Kabul with four cars and a helicopter full of cash. "The collapse of the regime ... is most eloquently characterised by how Ghani escaped from Afghanistan: four cars were filled with money, they tried to shove another part of the money into a helicopter, but not everything fit. And some of the money was left lying on the tarmac,” embassy spokesman Nikita Ishchenko was quoted saying in the report.Also watch: Joe Biden defends US exit from Afghanistan amid Taliban takeoverRussian President Vladimir Putin's special representative on Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, said on Monday Ghani’s flight from Kabul was “disgraceful,” and that the Afghan president “deserves to be brought to justice and held accountable by the Afghan people.”Also read | Will decide on recognising Taliban govt based on 'conduct': Russian envoyZhirnov said initially unarmed Taliban units had entered the capital and asked government and US forces to surrender their weapons and their main armed units entered later once Ghani fled and imposed a curfew.

"It's not for nothing that we've been establishing contacts with the Taliban movement for the last seven years. We saw that this force would in the end if not completely come to power would play a leading role in the future of Afghanistan in any case," Kabulov told Ekho Moskvy.Kabulov said Russia would decide on recognising the new Taliban government based "on the conduct of the new authorities" and that his country "established working contacts with representatives of the new authorities".(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabuls-situation-better-under-taliban-than-it-was-under-ghani-russia-101629165185504.html

17-08-2021||World||Haiti earthquake: Death toll rises to 1,419, injured now at 6,000||A hospital in southwestern Haiti, where a powerful earthquake flattened homes, shops and other buildings over the weekend, was so overwhelmed with patients that many had to lie in patios, corridors, verandas and hallways. Then a looming storm expected to bring heavy rains Monday night forced officials to relocate them as best they could given the hospital’s poor conditions.Even those patients were somewhat fortunate. Haiti’s Civil Protection Agency on Monday raised the death toll from Saturday’s earthquake to 1,419 and the number of injured to 6,000, many of whom have had to wait under the burning heat, even on an airport tarmac, for help.“We had planned to put up tents (in hospital patios), but we were told that could not be safe,” said Gede Peterson, director of Les Cayes General Hospital.It is not the first time that staff has been forced to improvise. The refrigeration in the hospital’s morgue has not worked for three months, but after the earthquake struck Saturday, staff had to store as many as 20 bodies in the small space. Relatives quickly came to take most to private embalming services or immediate burial. By Monday only three bodies were in the morgue.The quake, centered about 125 kilometers (80 miles) west of the capital of Port-au-Prince, nearly razed some towns and triggered landslides that hampered rescue efforts in a country that is the poorest in the Western Hemisphere. Haiti already was struggling with the coronavirus pandemic, gang violence, worsening poverty and the political uncertainty following the July 7 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse when the earthquake sent residents rushing to the streets.The devastation could soon worsen with the arrival of Tropical Depression Grace, predicted to bring strong winds, heavy rain, mudslides and flash flooding. Les Cayes began to see light rain Monday evening, but it could reach 15 inches (38 centimeters) in some areas, the Civil Protection Agency said. Port-au-Prince was already seeing heavier rains.“We are working now to ensure that the resources we have are going to get to the places that are hardest hit,” said agency head Jerry Chandler, referring to the towns of Les Cayes and Jeremie and the department of Nippes, which are in the country’s southwestern portion.Injured earthquake victims continued to stream into Les Cayes’ overwhelmed general hospital, three days after the earthquake struck. Patients waited to be treated on stair steps, in corridors and the hospital’s open veranda.“After two days, they are almost always generally infected,” said Dr. Paurus Michelete, who had treated 250 patients and was one of only three doctors on call when the quake hit.Meanwhile, rescuers and scrap metal scavengers dug into the floors of a collapsed hotel Monday in this coastal town, where 15 bodies had already been extracted. Jean Moise Fortunè, whose brother, the hotel owner and a prominent politician, was killed in the quake, believed there were more people trapped in the rubble.But based on the size of voids that workers cautiously peered into, perhaps a foot (0.3 meters) in depth, finding survivors appeared unlikely.As work, fuel and money ran out, desperate Les Cayes residents searched collapsed houses for scrap metal to sell. Others waited for money wired from abroad, a mainstay of Haiti’s economy even before the quake.Anthony Emile waited six hours in a line with dozens of others trying to get money his brother had wired from Chile, where he has worked since Haiti’s last quake.“We have been waiting since morning for it, but there are too many people,” said Emile, a banana farmer who said relatives in the countryside depend on him giving them money to survive.Efforts to treat the injured were difficult at the general hospital, where Michelete said pain killers, analgesics and steel pins to mend fractures were running out amid the crush of patients.“We are saturated, and people keep coming,” he said.Josil Eliophane, 84, crouched on the steps of the hospital, clutching an X-ray showing his shattered arm bone and pleading for pain medication.Michelete said he would give one of his few remaining shots to Eliophane, who ran out of his house as the quake hit, only to have a wall fall on him.Nearby, on the hospital’s open-air veranda, patients were on beds and mattresses, hooked up to IV bags of saline fluid. Others lay in the garden under bed sheets erected to shield them from the brutal sun. None of the patients or relatives caring for them wore face masks amid a coronavirus surge.Officials said the magnitude 7.2 earthquake left more than 7,000 homes were destroyed and nearly 5,000 damaged from the quake, leaving some 30,000 families homeless. Hospitals, schools, offices and churches also were destroyed or badly damaged.Underlining the dire conditions, local officials had to negotiate with gangs in the seaside district of Martissant to allow two humanitarian convoys a day to pass through the area, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported. The agency called Haiti’s southern peninsula a “hot spot for gang-related violence,” where humanitarian workers have been repeatedly attacked.The agency said the area has been “virtually unreachable” over the past two months because of road blocks and security concerns. Agency spokeswoman Anna Jefferys said the first convoy passed through Sunday with government and U.N. personnel. and the U.N. World Food Program plans to send in food supplies via trucks Tuesday.Prime Minister Ariel Henry declared a one-month state of emergency for the whole country and said the first government aid convoys had started moving help to areas where towns were destroyed and hospitals were overwhelmed.UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said humanitarian needs were acute, with many Haitians urgently needing health care, clean water and shelter. Children separated from their parents also needed protection, she said.“Little more than a decade on, Haiti is reeling once again," Fore said, referring to the 2010 earthquake that ravaged Haiti’s capital, killing tens of thousands. “And this disaster coincides with political instability, rising gang violence, alarmingly high rates of malnutrition among children, and the COVID-19 pandemic — for which Haiti has received just 500,000 vaccine doses, despite requiring far more.”The country of 11 million people received its first batch of US-donated coronavirus vaccines only last month via a United Nations program for low-income countries.Medical workers from across the region were scrambling to help as hospitals in Les Cayes started running out of space to perform surgeries.“Basically, they need everything,” said Dr. Inobert Pierre, a pediatrician with the nonprofit Health Equity International, which oversees St. Boniface Hospital, about two hours from Les Cayes.Pierre’s medical team was taking some patients to St. Boniface to undergo surgery, but with just two ambulances, they could transport only four at a time.Working with USAID, the US Coast Guard said a helicopter was transporting medical personnel from the Haitian capital to the quake zone and evacuating injured back to Port-au-Prince. Lt. Commander Jason Nieman, a spokesman, said other aircraft and ships were being sent.At the Les Cayes hospital, Emma Cadet, 41, a carpenter’s wife, hovered over her 18-year-old son, Charles Owen, as he awaited an operation on his broken arm. He was among the lucky patients to have received pain medication.Worse off was Nerison Vendredi, 19, lying quiet but alert. No casts or splint would help her because she apparently had suffered internal injuries and could not move.There were some stories of miracle survivals, but they were becoming fewer as the days passed.Jacquelion Luxama was leading his goats to a watering hole Saturday when a hillside collapsed on him, trapping him amid boulders and a rockslide that stripped skin from his hip.“I started yelling, and luckily some other famers heard me, and they came and pulled me out, ” said Luxama, lying on a mattress at the Les Cayes hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/haiti-earthquake-death-toll-rises-to-1-419-injured-now-at-6000-101629160634104.html
17-08-2021||World||Prince Andrew 'a person of interest' in Epstein probe||US prosecutors probing the activities of British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell and others linked to US financier Jeffrey Epstein consider Prince Andrew a person of interest in the investigation, a source familiar with the US inquiry said.Investigators want to interview Andrew, Queen Elizabeth’s second son, about his friendship with Epstein as part of their inquiry into possible co-conspirators, the source said. As a person of interest he is viewed at least as a potential witness.Prosecutors in 2020 said Andrew had “sought to falsely portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate” but had given no interview to federal authorities and had repeatedly declined requests to talk with investigators.While Andrew remains a person of interest to prosecutors in the office of the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, they do not expect to be able to interview him in the foreseeable future, if ever, according to the source."He doesn't seem to want to talk to us," said the source.Representatives of the Prince declined to comment.Earlier this month, Virginia Giuffre, who has said she was abused by Epstein, filed a civil complaint against Andrew in Manhattan federal court. Giuffre alleges Andrew forced her to have unwanted sexual intercourse at Maxwell's London home.Andrew has denied the allegation.Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of trafficking minors.Ghislaine Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to charges that she procured teenage girls for Epstein to sexually abuse between 1994 and 2004. She is expected to go on trial in November.Prosecutors last year sent the British government a formal request, known as a mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) submission, asking for access to the prince so they could talk to him.The MLAT is a procedure used in criminal investigations to gather material from foreign countries which cannot readily be obtained on a cooperative basis.Giuffre's lawyer had no immediate comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-andrew-a-person-of-interest-in-epstein-probe-101629160077332.html
17-08-2021||World||US may see 200k Covid cases daily soon: Top doctor||Warning of tough days ahead with surging Covid-19 infections, the director of the National Institutes of Health said Sunday that unvaccinated people are “sitting ducks” for a Delta variant that is ravaging the country and showing little sign of letting up“This is going very steeply upward with no signs of having peaked out,” Dr Francis Collins told “Fox News Sunday”.While the US currently is seeing an average of about 129,000 new infections a day — a 700% increase from the beginning of July — that number could jump in the next couple weeks to 200,000, a level not seen since among the pandemic’s worst days in January and February, Collins said.He said the US could decide in the next couple weeks whether to offer coronavirus booster shots to Americans this fall. Among the first to receive them could be health care workers, nursing home residents and other older Americans.Federal health officials have been actively looking at whether extra shots for the vaccinated may be needed as early as this fall, reviewing case numbers in the US “almost daily” as well as the situation in other countries such as Israel, where preliminary studies suggest the vaccine’s protection against serious illness dropped among those vaccinated in January.“There is a concern that the vaccine may start to wane in its effectiveness,” Collins said. “And Delta is a nasty one for us to try to deal with. The combination of those two means we may need boosters, maybe beginning first with health care providers, as well as people in nursing homes, and then gradually moving forward” with others.Areas with low vaccination rates have been particularly hit hard with infections, such as Louisiana, Texas, Florida and Mississippi.The rapidly escalating surge in infections across the US has caused a shortage of intensive care-unit beds, nurses and other front-line staff in virus hot spots that can no longer keep up with the flood of unvaccinated patients.“That’s heartbreaking considering we never thought we would be back in that space again,” Collins said of rising US infections overall. “But here we are with the Delta variant.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/usmay-see-200k-covid-cases-daily-soon-top-doctor-101629158338071.html
17-08-2021||World||Implications of US move for the world||The Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan, including the capital city of Kabul, has triggered concern across the world, and rightly so. Afghanistan would not have fallen to the Taliban had the United States not withdrawn its troops from the country. While the US had announced its troop withdrawal much earlier, the fact that it did not reconsider its decision even in the face of a near meltdown of the Afghan government’s resistance has drawn widespread criticism. The move has left a large section of the anti-Taliban Afghan population at the mercy of the group. As the world, especially India, will have to come to terms with the fallout of the Taliban establishing an Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan, the US’s indifference to the development has raised questions about its role as a global superpower.Many commentators have written that the US withdrawal from Afghanistan is primarily driven by domestic political-economic concerns, even if they undermine its self-proclaimed role as the vanguard of liberalism and democracy.An HT analysis shows that this is a reality which actually goes beyond the US’s willingness (or lack of it) to undertake military commitments outside its borders. The US has been displaying a similar tendency in fulfilling its role as the global capitalist leader, a term which was first popularised by Charles P Kindleberger, an economic historian who gave among the best accounts of the Great Depression of the 1930s. While the humanitarian and strategic implications of the US’s withdrawal from Afghanistan are likely to be catastrophic, the fallout of its economic actions (detailed below) is likely to be equally, if not more, profound for the world as we know it today. Here are three charts which explain this argument in detail.US military spending has gone down with the end of the Cold WarAmong the many things that forced the US to withdraw from Afghanistan was the cost of fighting a war which it could not decisively win even after two decades. According to an estimate by the Cost of War project by Watson Institute at Brown University, the Afghan war cost $2.26 trillion to the US between 2001 and 2021. This is almost 10% of the current annual GDP of the US. While saving dollars might have been a pressing concern in the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the so called “War on Terror” itself was an aberration in the US’s declining military spending from the peak of the Cold War era. World Bank statistics on the share of military spending in US GDP – it came down from just under 10% in the 1960s to just above 3% by the end of 1990s – proves this point. With the US out of both Iraq and Afghanistan now, its military spending is bound to come down further.US trade policy has taken a mercantilist turnKindleberger, among the most influential economic historians of the world, whose work on the Great Depression of the 1930s is considered to be a masterpiece, spoke about the need for a global capitalist leader for the stability of the international economic order. The Great Depression, according to Kindleberger, happened because Britain was not in a position to fulfil this role and the US, the emerging superpower, was not willing to take on the mantle. The US assumed this role in the period after the Second World War, triggering what is described as the Golden Age of capitalism. The US began its hegemonic phase with the Marshall Plan, where it funded reconstruction of war-ravaged Europe and also ran large trade deficits with many countries with anti-communist regimes. Being a “lender of last resort” and providing home market access were important requirements of what Kindleberger described as the role of a global capitalist leader. What began as a “stop the spread of communism” project, eventually culminated in the US aiding the rise of communist China as an economic superpower, emerging the biggest market for Chinese exports.A rise in outsourcing, destruction of domestic blue-collar jobs and the associated economic pain triggered a massive backlash in US’s domestic politics against globalisation, the biggest manifestation of which was Donald Trump’s victory in 2016. While the trend of a falling US trade deficit has stagnated in the past few years, and the post-pandemic recovery has seen a spike in imports, it is unlikely that the US will ever revert to the policy of throwing open its markets to strategic allies as it did during the Cold War. This will matter to countries such as India, whose strategic alliance with the US is stronger than ever today.Wall Street’s dominance, low interest rates and a looming financial sector crisisThe US government has remained unmoved to widespread appeals for reconsidering or even recalibrating the withdrawal from Afghanistan. This is in sharp contrast to the sensitivity the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, displays to criticism from financial markets whenever there is talk of raising interest rates, which are at near zero levels. A low interest rate regime in the US encourages investment in speculative assets such as shares both within and outside the country. Even a little talk of raising interest rates in the US, which will lead to money flowing back from riskier assets to the low-risk ones, can create a huge upset in financial markets, as happened during the “taper tantrum” of 2013.What is also true, however, is the fact that a prolonged cheap money-driven stock market book can sow the seeds of financial sector instability and an economic shock, when a correction finally comes. While it is always difficult to predict when this moment will come, it will not be an exaggeration to say that by encouraging a low interest-driven financial sector boom, the US has become, either by omission or commission, a source of systemic instability rather than being a hegemon which brought stability to the global capitalist system.

After 20 years, I've learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw US forces," he said in a televised address from the White House.He added that the US national interest in Afghanistan was always principally about preventing terrorist attacks from the war-torn nation on the US homeland."The mission in Afghanistan was never supposed to be nation-building," he said.He acknowledged that the Afghan government collapsed more quickly than he expected even as he defended his decision to withdraw troops."I always promised the American people that I will be straight with you. The truth is, this did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated," Biden said in a national address."We gave them every chance to determine their own future. We could not provide them with the will to fight for that future."Biden promised to prioritize the treatment of women and girls under the Taliban in Afghanistan after a US withdrawal allowed the return of the Islamist insurgents."We'll continue to speak out on the basic rights of the Afghan people, of women and girls," Biden said in a national address.He also warned the Taliban not to disrupt or threaten the evacuation of thousands of American diplomats and Afghan translators at the Kabul airport.The response to any attack would be "swift and forceful," Biden said in a televised address from the White House."We will defend our people with devastating force if necessary," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stand-squarely-behind-my-decision-to-withdraw-our-forces-biden-101629145469815.html
17-08-2021||World||Under attack, Biden returns to White House to speak on Afghanistan||US President Joe Biden will return to the White House and speak on Afghanistan at 1.15am on Tuesday in a bid perhaps to address criticism of the chaotic pullout of American troops and personnel and the swift return of the Taliban that he and his administration failed to foresee. Biden’s return from the president’s retreat where he was vacationing and the speech were announced in a revised guidance issued by the White House on Monday morning.CNN news anchor JakeTapper’s first question to US secretary of state Antony Blinken on his Sunday morning show captured the sense of how the rest of the United States was viewing President Joe Biden’s recent decisions on Afghanistan: “How did President Biden get this so wrong?” As morning hour wore on and Al Jazeera news channel began running clips of Taliban fighters walking around inside the President Palace abandoned by former president Ashraf Ghani, Biden was facing similar questions from both supporters and critics, with varying degrees of outrage and frustration. “This is going to be a stain on this president and this presidency,” said Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Relations Committee, on the same programme with Tapper. “I think he is going to have blood on his hands for what they did.” Ryan Crocker, who was president Barack Obama’s ambassador to Afghanistan, could sense the impending disaster. “I’m left with some grave questions in my mind about his ability to lead our nation as commander-in-chief,” Crocker told The Spokesman-Review, a Washington state publication, on Sunday morning, shortly before news came of the Taliban entering Kabul. “To have read this so wrong - or, even worse, to have understood what was likely to happen and not care,” the former ambassador of the Obama-Biden administration added. Biden did not issue any statement or posted a tweet all day. He was vacationing at the Camp David presidential retreat in the adjoining state of Maryland. As questions began to be raise about where was the president at this critical juncture in the nation’s history, the White House released a picture of him at a long table in a room with flags in a virtual conference with his national security team. Dressed in a casual T-shirt, he looked terribly alone. “This morning, the president and vice-president met with their national security team and senior officials to hear updates on the drawdown of our civilian personnel in Afghanistan, evacuations of SIV (special immigration visa) applicants and other Afghan allies, and the ongoing security situation in Kabul,” the White House wrote in the tweet. Barely a month ago, Biden has strenuously discounted any chance of the Taliban gaining early control of Kabul and the country. “Afghan troops have 300,000 well-equipped - as well-equipped as any army in the world - and an air force against something like 75,000 Taliban. It is not inevitable,” he had said on July 8 when asked if Taliban takeover was inevitable. More recently, Biden has said he does not regret the decision to pull US forces out of Afghanistan ending a “forever war”, but as the Taliban advanced swiftly in recent days to take control of the country, he has sought to deflect some of the criticism of his own actions by pointing to the flawed deal he inherited from Trump. “I inherited a deal cut by my predecessor - which he invited the Taliban to discuss at Camp David on the eve of 9/11 of 2019 -that left the Taliban in the strongest position militarily since 2001 and imposed a May 1, 2021 deadline on US forces,” Biden said, referring to a meeting that Trump had wanted to host at Camp David but did not. Trump had also drawn down US forces to a “a bare minimum of 2,500”, Biden, said, adding, that when he took over as president, he had two choices “follow through on the deal, with a brief extension to get our forces and our allies’ forces out safely, or ramp up our presence and send more American troops to fight once again in another country’s civil conflict”. Biden and his officials have since gone on to blame the “hollow” response of the Afghan army and security forces and their inability to hold off the Taliban despite their numerical superiority and better American-supplied equipment. “We would have been back at war with tens of thousands of troops having to go in because the 2,500 troops we had there and the air power would not have sufficed to deal with the situation, especially as we see, alas, the hollowness of the Afghan security forces,” Blinken said in the CNN interview.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/under-attack-biden-returns-to-white-house-to-speak-on-afghanistan-101629142168657.html

His compatriot assisted him in finding the place after Asif escaped Afghanistan on the last commercial flight from Kabul to Delhi.With tears in his eyes and speaking in broken Hindi, the 41-year-old officer said, “I had to run, else the Taliban would have killed me. Everything ends here. I could not bring my family along.”Asif fled the war-torn nation, which was completely captured by the Taliban on Sunday, leaving behind his ailing mother, wife and an 8-year-old son.He said that he “will try” to get a cheaper room in Delhi that costs between ₹200 and ₹300. The officer of the National Directorate of Security (NDS), however, broke down when asked if he had food while departing from Afghanistan. As his hands shook and lips quivered with tears streaming down his face, Asif showed his passport, an NDS ID card and photographs of his family from a bag he carried.He said that the Taliban are “catching [and] killing” them. “They sent us notices, asking us to revolt against the government or die,” Asif added.Stating that all hopes of survival were quashed following Afghan president Ashraf Ghani fleeing the country, the officer informed that hundreds of Afghan officers like him from the security establishments have “fled to Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and other countries.”Also Read | President Ashraf Ghani leaves Afghanistan as Taliban take over KabulAsif said he didn’t know how his family had been doing back in Afghanistan as internet services were affected in certain regions of Kabul, which fell into the hands of Taliban on Sunday. “I got my visa a month ago. Ten days ago, we had intel that the Taliban is going to return,” he added.The NDS officer, looking back at his life in his homeland, pointed out that Pakistan “betrayed [them].”He added that he and some of his colleagues, who also took the last flight to India, had changed into civilian robes before boarding the plane. Notably, the national carrier Air India said on Monday that commercial flights have been suspended to Kabul owing to the closure of Afghanistan’s airspace. As many as 129 passengers were brought back to India on Sunday after flight AI 244 departed from Kabul at 6.06pm. The Monday morning flight was first rescheduled and later cancelled.Also Read | Air India can’t operate Kabul flight as airspace shuts downAsif also highlighted how women in Kabul have already commenced to ditch salwar-kameez for burqas, and have been staying off streets – keeping indoors, adding that they will be killed if they don’t.“Sab khatam (everything is over) …There’s no chance we will ever return to our country. Our beloved home is lost. I don’t even know if my family will be able to make it to India,” he said.Similar to Asif, one of Ghani’s advisors on public health affairs, R Ahmadzai, also arrived in Delhi on Sunday after the Taliban’s entry into the capital city of Afghanistan. He said all Afghan politicians and ministers have fled Afghanistan.“There was a lot of anxiety and depression over the last one month, but now there is not much fighting [in Afghanistan]. People are at peace now,” the advisor said.He added that around 200 such ministers and advisors like him have reached Delhi, and that till 5pm on Sunday, Ghani was in Afghanistan. “We don’t know where Ghani has left for,” Ahmadzai said.Watch here | Afghan president's advisor arrives in India, says all ministers left KabulHe further stated that the Taliban have promised that they won’t impose a brutal rule over the country like the last time, and will especially allow more freedom to women and girls, including letting them work wearing a hijab.Ghani’s departure, leaving behind his country, has drawn major flak with regional social media platforms even calling him a “coward.” However, the former President defended his choice saying that the Taliban made their way back into Afghanistan with their “swords and guns” and that he escaped to prevent a “flood of bloodshed.”Notably, Taliban captured the presidential palace on Sunday itself.Meanwhile, US troops reportedly temporarily closed the evacuation of its diplomats and other citizens from Afghanistan on Monday in order to clear the airfield at the Hamid Karzai International Airport, senior defence officials said.This came after they reportedly fired shots into the air when several Afghans tried to catch the planes at the Kabul airport to flee Afghanistan.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-intel-officer-fled-to-delhi-on-last-flight-from-kabul-to-escape-taliban-101629139600183.html

In the four-seconds-long video, an unidentified man dressed in black clothes is seen shooting at a person who was trying to climb the wall and jump into the airport.The video was shared by Saad Mohseni, who is a director of MOBY Group, the media house which also owns Afghan TV news agency TOLO News.HT could not verify the authenticity of the video. Mohseni, in another tweet, retweeted the same video from the Twitter handle of Miraqa Popal, who is the head of news at TOLO News.According to Popal’s tweet, the civilian was trying to enter the airport by scaling the wall and claimed that the shooter is a Taliban fighter.Kabul continues to witness chaos as civilians try to flee Afghanistan fearing that the Taliban would take the nation back to how it was between 1996 and 2001, when the terrorist group ruled the country. The Taliban have projected a moderate face where they have said that women’s rights will be respected but citizens of Kabul are apprehensive and continued to crowd the Kabul airport in a last-ditch attempt to escape the war-torn nation which fell to the mujahideen in a matter of a few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-shooting-civilians-trying-to-enter-kabul-airport-report-101629139905961.html

It is implemented under the Smart City Mission, urban renewal and retrofitting programme by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs. Any member of the public can access the Wi-Fi in these 49 locations for half an hour at the speed of 2 Mbps for free. “As of now, there is no provision to extend the timing even if people are willing to pay. We may provide that option in the future,” an official of GCC said, not wishing to be named. Some of the key locations where the smart poles have been fitted with wifi routers include railway stations, the Rajiv Gandhi Government General hospital, the judges’ entrance of the Madras high court, parks, and seven locations along the Marina beach stretch opposite which important government offices are also located. “The smart poles were installed in December, but there are barely any users, so we released the list of Wi-Fi locations today to bring this information to the public,” the official said. Users can register from their phones using their full name and mobile number and start using the Wi-Fi after receiving an OTP. The civic body and its technology partners can monitor the number of users at a particular location and the data that they are consuming. The multifunctional smart poles are connected to a Command Control Centre of the GCC, which the civic body modelled after similar integrated systems in Moscow and Singapore. The smart pole also has an emergency call button that will alert the local police station and GCC. They are fitted with CCTVs, rain gauges, and the poles monitor air pollution levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/free-wi-fi-poles-in-49-chennai-areas-101629224800932.html
17-08-2021||India||100 days of DMK: Activities of HR&CE are back to life||On the third death anniversary of his father M Karunanidhi on August 7, chief minister M K Stalin launched a drive to plant 100,000 saplings of Sthala Vruksham (sacred tree for every temple) on lands attached to temples under the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) department. The move is being seen as Stalin’s bid to counter being typecast as anti-Hindu, which has been the Bharatiya Janata Party’s campaign against the ruling party in Tamil Nadu. After the DMK came back to power on May 2 after a gap of 10 years, a large portion of the new government’s first 100 days in office had been devoted to firefighting the devastating second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. Yet, the activities of the HR&CE department, which was almost obscure, sprang to life under the new regime. DMK’s dogmatic rationalist beginnings have been used against it repeatedly, but the party has maintained it respects all religions. Most recently, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) attacked the DMK by labelling it as ‘anti-Hindu’ on the campaign trail for the assembly elections. However, the DMK managed to fend it off as mass politics led the party to be more accommodative. The electorate, too, which is a Hindu majority, has not seen a contradiction as several DMK leaders are practitioners of various religions and faiths. Besides, the women of DMK’s first family are often seen visiting temples. According to political analysts, Stalin is merely taking forward his father’s schemes with respect to temples, appointments of priests and initiatives for devotees, but with discernible display. Careful planning has gone into the public image makeover from the campaign trail to the election manifesto to now in office. Stalin picked a trusted aide and a believer PK Sekar Babu, whose phone rings to a devotional Sabarimala Ayyappa caller tune, as minister of the department. Babu, who sports a horizontal vermillion mark between his eyebrows and is always clad in a white shirt and dhoti, has been crisscrossing the state inspecting temples besides inspecting hospitals when Covid-19 cases were peaking. Babu is also the minister in-charge for Covid-19 control in Chennai and was often seen accompanying Stalin during most of his hospital visits and events. When the DMK was in the opposition, Babu often filled in for Stalin for social events like marriages, housewarming in latter’s Kolathur constituency even though he represented Harbour constituency. “He was the most hardworking person for Stalin in Kolathur,” said a DMK functionary.Given his proximity to Stalin and his own religious beliefs, Babu is both well aware of Stalin’s expectations and of the operations around temples. “He (Stalin) knows a cadre and a leader in the party alike. He analyses what each person is capable of. So, he handed over this ministry with that faith in me,” said Babu.The HR&CE manages 44,121 temples in Tamil Nadu. The government is in the process of a mammoth exercise of digitising papers of properties and assets owned by temples to make them available in the public domain. “The idea is to make everything transparent,” Babu said. It was also seen as an effort to blunt a growing campaign to free temples in Tamil Nadu by the BJP and spiritual guru Jaggi Vasudev. “Yes, we did focus on this department’s initiatives, and it has silenced that (free temples) campaign, but we didn’t expect the HR&CE to gain so much of popularity,” a DMK leader said on the condition of anonymity. The initiatives and announcements that steered this department to prominence include, Stalin appointing 24 non-Brahmin trained priests to temples on completion of 100 days in office. On the same day, a woman Odhuvar (one who chants hymns before the deity), 28-year-old Suhanjana Gopinath, was appointed to a Chennai temple. Stalin was implementing an order passed by Karunanidhi (during his tenure in 2006-2011) in entirety to allow priesthood at temples for people of all castes and births for those who are formally trained in the agamas and the other ritual texts. Babu had earlier announced that the DMK government will take steps to provide training to women who are interested in becoming priests. After the DMK took over the state administration in May, Babu and his team have taken a series of actions to protect the assets of temples. Encroachments have been evicted and 187.9 acres of land, 161.7 acres of vacant plots and more have been retrieved and restored to the control of temples. The revised budget this year allocated ₹100 crore for renovation work of temple this year. An additional corpus of ₹130 crore has been created in the recent state budget to provide assistance to perform one-time pooja in 12,959 temples. According to the budget, training schools will be revived to create a trained pool of Oduvar and Archakas. Master plans are also to be developed for 539 temples to conserve their heritage. After Stalin made 208 new appointments to various positions in the HR&CE department, including 24 priests from various castes, it was welcomed by all parties, including the BJP. However, there were accusations that several serving priests were asked to make way for new entrants. On Tuesday, Babu dismissed the accusations saying the party has no intention to remove anyone. “Hindus who take up Hindutva are left with no job now, so they are involved in these ill campaigns,” Babu said.R Kannan, author of books on DMK founder C N Annadurai and ADMK (later AIADMK founder) MG Ramachandran (MGR), recalls that the shift happened with Anna who famously said “ondre kulam oruvane devan”, meaning one religion, one God. And that Karunanidhi bettered him by allotting funds for temple renovation, enhancing temple cars and more in the 1970s. Despite that Karunanidhi had on several occasions made vocal remarks against believers. “But the assertion of a section of the Hindus in the presence of BJP is now compelling a change in narrative from the yesteryears. So the DMK is boxed into a corner where it’s become defensive and it has to constantly say that it’s not anti-Hindu,” said Kannan.Political analyst Raveendran Duraisamy said, “Stalin is undoing all the anti-Hindu projections made against him in a well-thought-out strategy.”“In doing so, he is also exposing the looters of temple lands who were spared by the previous government and curtailing the BJP’s growth. However, the BJP is taking a different form in Tamil Nadu, we can’t single them out as a Brahmincal party like in other states because they have supported archakas of all castes but they are campaigning for freeing temples,” Duraisamy added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/100-days-of-dmk-activities-of-hr-ce-are-back-to-life-101629224799480.html
17-08-2021||India||Wife booked for torturing alcoholic husband in Rajasthan||A 25-year-old woman has been booked for an attempt to murder for allegedly drugging and torturing her husband, in Rajasthan’s Churu district, police said on Tuesday. The husband is currently undergoing treatment at a government hospital in Bikaner, officials said, adding that the woman accused him of abuse.According to the police, on August 12, when the man, 32, returned home from work, he fell unconscious after his wife served him dinner allegedly laced with sedatives. In his complaint, the victim said his wife covered his hands with polythene bags and tied electricity wires to his legs before subjecting him to electric shocks, said an official familiar with the matter.“The victim alleged that he fell unconscious after dinner and woke up late at night due to the electric shocks,” said sub-inspector Manak Lal. “Around 2 am, the woman called her in-laws and told them that her husband has been hospitalised after sustaining injuries due to the electric shocks,” the official added. Police said the victim has sustained burn injuries to his legs.Preliminary investigation has revealed that the victim is an alcoholic and allegedly subjected his wife to domestic abuse, said a police officer, adding that, “she decided to give him electric shocks to teach him a lesson”. “We have booked the woman under section 307 of the Indian Penal Code. A further probe is underway in the case,” a police official said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wife-booked-for-torturing-alcoholic-husband-in-rajasthan-101629223059147.html
17-08-2021||India||Firing stokes Assam-Mizoram tension||Gunshots rang out at the Assam-Mizoram border on Tuesday, ratcheting up interstate tensions mere weeks after both the governments announced a road map for peaceful negotiations following a violent showdown last month.Police officials from both states said the firing occurred around 2am on Tuesday in the reserve forests of the Darashing Hills area on the Assam side.One person from Mizoram sustained injuries, but not due to the firing, Mizoram Police said.Assam Police claimed that they tried to intercept some unidentified Mizoram residents trying to cross the border and retaliated after being fired on. Assam didn’t clarify whether local residents or Mizoram Police fired the first shots.Mizoram Police said some locals were going to their friends’ house on the Assam side when they were threatened by Assam’s force. Mizoram said it didn’t fire shots.On July 26, police forces of the two states fought a pitched gun battle at the disputed border, killing six Assam policemen and injuring about 40 others. Tuesday’s firing happened in a different section of the border.Assam districts of Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi share a 164.6km-long border with Mizoram’s Aizawl, Kolasib and Mamit districts. The decades-old border dispute stems primarily from a difference in perception. Mizoram goes by an 1875 border agreement but Assam follows a 1933 demarcation.Tensions abated in the first week of August after central intervention. The two states held a peace summit and agreed to withdraw state forces from the border, allow central inspection and initiate talks. But Tuesday’s violence showed that state police forces continued to patrol the border and indicated that decades-old tensions simmered despite the frenetic negotiation efforts.Superintendent of police of Assam’s Hailakandi district, Gaurav Upadhyay, said at around 2 am on Tuesday, police officials noticed some people trying to enter Assam and using “some sort of signal" with torch lights.He said Assam Police officials attempted to confront and question them but received gunfire from the upper side of the hill on the Mizoram side. In return, Assam Police fired 12 rounds of blank shots which forced the people to flee.“First of all, we did not start the firing; our officials were attacked with bullets from upper side of the hill which is under Mizoram. Ordinary civilians do not cross the border silently at 2am, so it appears these people were up to something fishy. Our officials did not fire on them first as we have been instructed not to do it. Some wrong messages are being given from the Mizoram’s side which should not be done,” Upadhyay said.He also said that the area where these three people were stopped came under Assam and was not a disputed part of the border. “If this was a disputed area, higher officials would have intervened by now,” he added.Superintendent of police of Mizoram’s Kolasib district, Vanlalfaka Ralte, said: “In bordering areas, people are friends with each other and they exchange things amongst them. This is unfortunate that Assam Police tried to use bullets on innocent civilians of Mizoram.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/firing-stokes-assam-mizoram-tension-101629222998977.html

17-08-2021||India||India expresses concern over vandalisation of Ranjit Singh’s statue in Pakistan||India on Tuesday expressed concern at the vandalization of a statue of Maharaja Ranjit Singh in Lahore, saying incidents of violence against Pakistan’s minorities are increasing at an “alarming rate”.According to reports from Lahore, a member of the radical group, Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan, vandalised the statue located within the Lahore Fort complex. Police detained the man allegedly responsible for the act after he was held by people in the area.This was the third time the statue, located in a high-security area, was vandalised since it was unveiled in 2019.External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi described the incident as “disturbing” and said, “Such attacks on the cultural heritage of minority communities in Pakistan highlight the growing intolerance and lack of respect for minority communities in Pakistani society.”He added, “Incidents of violence against minority communities, including attacks on their places of worship, their cultural heritage, as well as their private property, are increasing at an alarming rate.”Bagchi noted that just 12 days ago, a mob attacked and desecrated a Hindu temple at Rahim Yar Khan in Pakistan.“The Pakistani state has completely failed in its duty to prevent such attacks. This is creating a climate of fear for the minority communities to practice their faith,” he said.“We call upon the government of Pakistan to ensure the safety, security and well-being of its minority communities,” Bagchi added.The nine-foot bronze statue was unveiled in June 2019 to mark the 180th death anniversary of Ranjit Singh, the first Maharaja of the Sikh empire who ruled over Punjab for close to 40 years.The statue shows Ranjit Singh sitting on a horse in regal attire, sword in hand. Just two months after its unveiling, the statue was vandalised by two members of Tehreek-e-Labbaik. Both men were arrested by police.Video footage of Tuesday’s incident showed a man tearing an arm off the statue and then removing it from atop the horse and hurling it to the ground.The incident was condemned by several Pakistani leaders, including information minister Fawad Chaudhry.Meanwhile, Bibi Jagir Kaur, president of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), also strongly condemned the demolition of the statue on Tuesday.In a statement, she said that Maharaja Ranjit Singh was a Sikh king in whose kingdom all had equal rights and there was no discrimination against anyone. She said the rule of Maharaja Ranjit Singh was based on the principles of the Sikh Gurus which included social equality and religious freedom for all.“Apart from Sikhs, the officials of other religions were also appointed at Maharaja Ranjit Singh's court. He had great respect for other religions and got the work done as per their requirements,” she said.The SGPC president said Maharaja Ranjit Singh was one of the select rulers of the world who did great deeds for the welfare of mankind."Demolishing the statue of a world-renowned Sikh ruler and expressing hatred was an act against humanitarian concerns. I appeal to the government of Pakistan to take stern action against those responsible for desecrating the statue of Maharaja Ranjit Singh so that no such heinous act is committed again," she added.Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president Manjinder Singh Sirsa said in a social media post, "Pakistan’s radicals try once again to hurt Sikh sentiments by vandalising Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s statue. Earlier it was Khadim Hussain Rizvi who spoke ill about Maharaja Ranjit Singh and now his party people do such hateful things. I hope @ImranKhanPTI would take stern action against the culprits to ensure religious harmony in Pak"."I have apprised Jt Secretary, Min of External Affairs (PAI) Mr JP Singh about this incident who has assured me that he would take up this matter with Pak High Commission and ask them to take a strict action to curb such hateful vandalising events," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-expresses-concern-over-vandalisation-of-ranjit-singh-s-statue-in-pakistan-101629213098763.html

The meeting was being attended by senior ministers and officials, including home minister Amit Shah, national security advisor Ajit Doval, defence minister Rajnath Singh and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla.Indian ambassador to Afghanistan Rudrendra Tandon, who came back from Kabul earlier in the day as part of India's emergency evacuation from the war-torn nation, briefed the CCS.According to senior govt sources, the CCS was briefed in detail about the current and evolving security and political situation in Afghanistan. The CCS was also informed about the recent evacuations of Indian Embassy officials and some members of Indian community, as well as some members of Indian media, according to a report in ANI.The PM has been constantly in touch with senior officials over the situation. “He was taking stock of the situation till late in the night on Monday and was updated when the flight (with staff of the Indian embassy in Kabul) took off. He has also instructed that adequate arrangements be made to ensure food for all those who returned at Jamnagar,” a source was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Earlier, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, who is on a four-day visit to the US to attend UN Security Council events, said the movement of the Indian ambassador and the Embassy staff from Afghanistan to India was a "difficult and complicated exercise" as he thanked those who cooperated and facilitated the efforts.Also read | This photo captures how desperate Afghans are to escape TalibanA C-17 Globemaster aircraft of the Indian Air Force carrying around 150 people, including diplomats, officials, security personnel and some stranded Indians, landed at the Hindon airbase near the national capital around 5pm after a brief halt at Jamnagar in Gujarat, in the wake of escalating tension, fear and uncertainty gripping the Afghan capital following the seizure of power by the Islamic militant group, two decades after it was overthrown by the US military.It was the second evacuation flight as another C-17 aircraft brought back around 40 people from the Hamid Karzai International (HKI) Airport in Kabul on Monday as part of India's emergency evacuation mission that was carried out following coordination with relevant authorities, including US officials handling security at the airport in the Afghan capital.The government has been making all efforts for total evacuation of Indian citizens stuck in Afghanistan after the Taliban asserted control over the nation.India has also opened an e-visa facility for Afghans, irrespective of religion amid the crisis.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-chairs-cabinet-meet-on-afghanistan-situation-shah-nsa-in-attendance-101629207449977.html
17-08-2021||India||Taliban can’t be trusted: Abdul Ghaffar Khan’s granddaughter urges Modi, world leaders to help Afghanistan||As mayhem in the aftermath of Afghanistan falling in the hands of Taliban continues to evoke shock across the world, ‘Frontier Gandhi’ Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan’s granddaughter Yasmin Nigar Khan said that the Islamist extremist group “cannot be trusted” because “they might say something now and do something else the next day.”“We can just appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the rest of the world that the manner in which they cared for Syria, Palestine and other war-torn countries, they should look at Afghanistan too,” Yasmin told news agency ANI on Tuesday.Yasmin, who is the president of the Pakhtoon Jirga-e-Hind, and lives in Kolkata, said that Afghans who live in the city are “worried about their families” back home. “The Taliban took over without a fight,” she added, describing the group’s clean sweep over the Afghan Army that was for nearly two decades trained and provided with equipment by the US.Referring to the top leaders of Afghanistan escaping the chaos in the country, Yasmin further said, “The leaders left the country but the common people, the poor, the women, the children are making sacrifices. They should be looked after.”Her remarks come in the backdrop of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and several of his close aides fleeing the country reportedly to take refuge in Tajikistan and other central Asian countries. Ghani, who has been called out for betraying his fellow country people, took to Facebook on Monday to defend his choice.“The Taliban have won with the judgement of their swords and guns, and are now responsible for the honour, property and self-preservation of their countrymen,” the former President’s Facebook post read.Also Read | Afghan president Ghani says left to prevent 'flood of bloodshed'“If left unchecked, countless patriots would be martyred and the city of Kabul would be devastated, resulting in a major humanitarian catastrophe in the six-million-strong city,” Ghani wrote, adding that he left Afghanistan to prevent a “flood of bloodshed.”Meanwhile, the Taliban on Tuesday declared an “amnesty” across Afghanistan and urged women to join its government – in what can be deemed as an attempt to help civilians calm themselves as the latter continue to look for ways to leave their homeland.The statements by Enamullah Samangani, a member of the Taliban's cultural commission, mark one of the first by the extremist group since they gained control over the country and captured the presidential palace as well on Sunday. Although they have projected a relatively moderate view this time around – shying away from the ultraconservative Islamic rule they had imposed the last time, Afghans still dwell in sheer fear and anxiety.Also Read | Taliban announces 'amnesty' across Afghanistan, urges women to join govt“The Islamic Emirate doesn't want women to be victims” Samangani said, adding that they should be in the government structure “according to Shariah law.” Samangani, however, said that the Taliban government’s structure is “not fully clear,” but based on “experience, there should be a fully Islamic leadership” and all sides should join.Meanwhile, India withdrew nearly 200 Indian officials and security personnel, including the Indian ambassador to Afghanistan Rudrendra Tandon, in two batches of C-17 Globemaster III military transport aircraft on Monday and Tuesday – with the planes being operated in secrecy, following the breakdown of the Ghani-led government in Afghanistan.Also Read | IAF's C-17 aircraft with over 120 Indian diplomats from Kabul lands in DelhiSpeaking to reporters during the aircraft’s brief halt at Gujarat’s Jamnagar base before reaching Delhi, Tandon said, “We’re continuously monitoring the situation because there are still some Indian citizens who are there.”He added that the national carrier Air India will continue to run its commercial services to Kabul “as long as the airport in Kabul functions.”(With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/abdul-ghaffar-khan-s-granddaughter-urges-modi-world-leaders-to-help-afghanistan-101629205868715.html
17-08-2021||India||Internal, bilateral: Taliban 'clarify' position on Kashmir||In an apparent clarification of their stance on Kashmir, days after taking over Kabul in a literal powershift of governance in Afghanistan, the Taliban called it a "bilateral and an internal matter", news agency ANI posted on Twitter quoting people familiar with the development.The Taliban is unlikely to focus on Kashmir, the news agency reported attributing it to the official.Amid concerns over increased militancy in Kashmir, the official said that security in the Valley have been increased and Pakistan-based groups in Afghanistan have little capacity to use the evolving situation in the war-torn nation."There are security concerns that #Afghanistan might become the first epicenter of Islamic terrorism which has a state, they have access to all the weapons which Americans have supplied and also the weapons of 3 lakh plus Afghan National Army personnel," ANI tweeted, quoting the official.Those familiar with the fast-changing situation in Afghanistan said Pakistan-based terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi have a presence in Afghanistan and they are known to have built checkpoints in some villages and parts of Kabul, with the help of the Taliban."In the past, there were camps of Pakistani outfits in Afghanistan. So we have to be careful in Jammu & Kashmir," the official told the news agency.Concerns have been raised over the possibility of Pakistani spy agency ISI trying to influence the Taliban. However, the official said such a move by Pakistan is likely to have a very limited effect as the Taliban acquired power in a "position of strength"."The ISI can only influence weak Taliban but it looks unlikely in the present situation," the official said.Afghanistan's takeover by the Taliban, which security experts say would not have been possible without the direct help from Pakistan, complicates the security situation in India's northern and north-western borders.A former Indian foreign secretary said last week that the Taliban establishing its emirate in Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul would not only give "strategic space to Pakistan but also trained terrorist cadre to target their adversaries."Pakistan seldom shied away from expressing its support to the Taliban. On Monday, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said Afghans has "broken the shackles of slavery" in response to the Taliban takeover.In fact, a US Congressman urged President Joe Biden to impose sanctions on Pakistan amid accusations that Islamabad covertly assisted the Taliban and dictating the the insurgent group with its military strategy."At the least, Pakistan is complicit with the Taliban advance and is choosing not to coordinate with the ANSF (Afghan National Security Force). At worst, the Pakistani military and intelligence services may be directly aiding the Taliban offensive," Republican lawmaker Mike Waltz said as he urged the Biden Administration to cut off aid to Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taliban-kashmir-pakistan-terror-groups-insurgency-afghanistan-security-situation-101629204421516.html
17-08-2021||India||Second monsoon ‘break’ leaves large rain deficiency in August||Monsoon in the first half of August has been subdued over most parts of the country, according to India Meteorological Department’s data. In August, there is 33% deficiency in rainfall over the country with 51% deficiency over central India; 22% deficiency over northwest India; 37.7% deficiency over peninsular India and 5% deficiency over east and northeast India.This has also brought down the cumulative rainfall received during the monsoon season so far with a 9% rainfall deficiency from June 1 to August 16 over the entire country. There is 8% deficiency over northwest India; 11% deficiency over east and northeast India; 13% shortage over central India and 5% excess over south peninsula.This was mainly due to “break” monsoon conditions in the last couple of weeks when the monsoon trough was mostly over the Himalayan foothills. There was a “break” in monsoon rain in July also from June 29 to July 11. Monsoon may pick up gradually from Wednesday. “We had break monsoon conditions in August as the monsoon trough remained near the foothills most of the time leading to scanty rain over the plains. The Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) was also at an unfavourable location leading to scanty rains. There was a long break phase in July also. But now there is a new monsoon pulse over southern peninsula which will move upwards gradually. A low-pressure area which has formed over northwest Bay of Bengal will also bring rain in its path,” said DS Pai, senior scientist at IMD Pune.Also Read | Dry spell set to end, IMD predicts rain from August 20In August, rainfall was limited to east Rajasthan and west Madhya Pradesh where flooding was reported due to excess rain. But there was a 56% deficiency over Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi region; 50% deficiency over west Rajasthan; 63% over Punjab; and 90% deficiency over Gujarat region.“The deficiency is mainly due to break monsoon conditions. But with the movement of the low pressure system we are expecting rains to commence over central India including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh etc and then over parts of northwest India from August 19. Easterly winds at lower levels have started picking up over some parts of northwest India,” added RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre, IMD.On Tuesday, IMD said there is likely to be revival of monsoon activity over northwest India with enhanced rainfall activity over Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat region and Chhattisgarh till August 19 and over northeast India and Sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim till August 18.There is a low-pressure area over coastal Odisha and adjoining northwest Bay of Bengal. It is likely to move west-northwestwards during the next 48 hours across interior Odisha, Chhattisgarh and northeast Madhya Pradesh. The western end of monsoon trough is north of its normal position and the eastern end is south of its normal position and passes through the centre of low-pressure area over coastal Odisha and adjoining northwest Bay of Bengal to eastcentral Bay of Bengal. The western end of monsoon trough is very likely to shift gradually southwards towards its near normal position during the next two days. Strong southerly winds from Bay of Bengal to northeast India will continue to prevail till August 18.There is a warning for increased rainfall activity over northwest India from August with widespread rainfall activity and isolated heavy rainfall likely over Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh from August 19 to 23; over Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi on August 20 and 21; heavy to very heavy is also very likely over Uttarakhand on August 19 and 20. “Rains during the second half may help cover the rain deficiency during monsoon season,” added Pai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/second-monsoon-break-leaves-large-rain-deficiency-in-august-101629203734709.html

17-08-2021||India||‘We are not cowards,’ says Afghan soldier who trained at IMA, Dehradun||An Afghan National Army officer, who was trained at Dehradun’s Indian Military Academy and has gone into hiding after the Taliban took over Afghanistan, has said they did not expect the fall of Kabul in such a short time while insisting they are not cowards.“Believe me, our army is strong. They (Taliban) are not that strong to overcome us by military force. It happened because the politicians sold us. They sold out the dignity and values...(of soldiers) who sacrificed their lives for our national flag and nation,” he told HT over WhatsApp from an undisclosed location near Kabul.“A few days ago, the Taliban attacked one of our bases in western Afghanistan. But our commanding officers and political leaders asked us not to retaliate saying it will spoil the ongoing peace dialogue with them. And they then went on to capture all the important military bases of ours.” The officer said he has not eaten anything since Sunday. “Nor have I slept since then. I am only worried about my parents who are alone at home in Kabul…I do not have any ration left. But it is summer and there is lots of grass.”Also Read | Afghan crisis: Satellite images reveal the chaos at Kabul airportHe said he managed to speak to his parents on Monday night. “They asked me to stay away from the city as the Taliban are roaming on the streets, armed. I am miles away from them, but that does not mean I am scared. Never. But till now nothing is clear,” he said. He added he is worried about his father because the Taliban know who he is.“He fought against the Soviets in the 80s. If they carry door-to-door search, then they will find him. But he is a brave man,” he said.The officer said they could not stock any ration because things happened so quickly. “But I have trained in India and know how to survive.” He said the country is looking at Ahmad Massoud, the son of national hero Ahmad Shah Massoud, for leadership. “He has said he will struggle against Taliban as we are not going to accept their rule again. His people in Panjshir Valley have enough ammunition to stand against Taliban,” he said. “There is still hope. We will struggle.”Another Afghan, who worked for the previous government, said he fears for his wife and sister after the return of the Taliban in Kabul. He too has gone into hiding as the Taliban were looking for him. “I was posted in Kohistan province of Afghanistan when Taliban took over. I escaped to Kabul where my family lives. But before we could plan an escape to safety, they captured Kabul also. Now, I have left my home and hiding somewhere else,” he said on WhatsApp. “The Taliban are searching for me, and I do not know if they capture me, what will they do to my wife and sister.” He said he tried to go to Panjshir but failed. “I could not do so because the Taliban blocked all the roads around Kabul. My brother managed to go there. He is safe now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-are-not-cowards-says-afghan-soldier-who-trained-at-imadehradun-101629202834618.html

She said she joined the TMC as she found it to be an “excellent platform” for her purpose to work for the area she belongs to. Following Dev’s resignation, the Congress appointed Netta D’Souza as interim president for the women’s wing until a full-time president is chosen.“My association with the Congress has been 30 years long and I have listed reasons for resignation in my letter. Congress gave me many opportunities as an MP and as president of Mahila Congress too… I believe whatever responsibility was given to me, I worked on it fully. And if there have been some lacunae in my work, I hope its president will forgive me,” she said at a press conference.Dev added that after submitting her resignation to the Congress on August 15, she travelled to Kolkata on August 16 where she met Abhishek Banerjee, TMC’s national general secretary, and had an hour-long conversation with him. “Following this, I met Mamata didi who ratified my membership (in the party),” Dev said.Also Read | Sushmita Dev’s resignation hasn’t come as surprise to Assam CongressShe said that joining the TMC will not, in any way, be “counterproductive” towards the goal that the Opposition was looking at in the future.She also added that while in Congress, Rahul Gandhi gave her ample opportunities to contest elections, to be a national spokesperson, and to be a part of the Mahila Congress. “Not even for a moment, I will be ungrateful for that,” she said.Meanwhile, regarding her conversation with Abhishek Banerjee, Dev added that her meeting with him had been excellent. She said that Abhishek Banerjee has “immense clarity and is confident about his vision”.“He can take that vision to the ground in whichever direction and whichever part of the country (he wants),” she said.Dev said it was utterly wrong to compare Abhishek Banerjee and Rahul Gandhi. “This is against my principles. I have worked under Rahul Gandhi... and shall work under Abhishek Banerjee too.

Dev added that her job will remain the same and it is just the platform that has changed.She said that legacy of Mamata Banerjee was an inspiration. “I have my full faith in Mamata didi. I have joined the TMC without any preconditions because a new relation sustains on trust (not preconditions),” she said.Meanwhile, Derek O’Brien said that the TMC was not “poaching” politicians but were just welcoming those with relevant aspirations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-excellent-platform-to-work-for-the-area-i-belong-to-sushmita-dev-101629199417247.html

India decided to withdraw the ambassador and all other staff from the mission in Kabul – effectively closing the embassy for the second time since 1996 – due to the uncertainty created by the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan following the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government on Sunday. Close to 200 Indian officials and security personnel were flown out of Kabul in two groups on two C-17 military heavy lift aircraft on Monday and Tuesday, with the flights being conducted in secrecy amid the chaotic occupation of Kabul by the Taliban. On Monday, the second group of officials faced problems in getting to the airport from the embassy – a distance of about 10 km – because of checkpoints set up by the Taliban. “We are continuously monitoring the situation because there are still some Indian citizens who are there. That is why Air India will continue to run its commercial services to Kabul as long as the airport in Kabul functions,” Tandon told reporters during a brief interaction at the airbase in Jamnagar, Gujarat, where the C-17 landed en route to Hindon airbase. Also Read | Jailed IS members among Indians freedThe envoy said Air India had temporarily suspended its flights to Kabul because of the conditions at the airport. “However, we continue to ensure that anyone who is stuck there is somehow brought [back], for which the [external affairs ministry] has opened a help desk that is operating already,” he said. He added, “As you know, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan no longer exists and the situation is quite fluid now.” Asked about the number of Indian nationals who are still in Afghanistan, Tandon said it would be difficult to give an exact figure as Indians didn’t always register themselves with the embassy in Kabul despite advisories. “There are some individuals there...I know personally of at least five or six but the figures sometimes that are quoted to us is there could be 40 to 50. But that is not something that I will stand by officially because we don’t have it as registered persons on our database,” he said. Tandon said the Indian side will continue to remain in contact with the Afghan people despite the withdrawal of the diplomatic staff. “It’s not that we have abandoned the people of Afghanistan, their welfare and our relationship with them is very much on our minds. We will try and continue our interaction with them [but] I can’t say in what form as the situation is changing,” he said. The envoy spoke hours after the Indian government introduced a new e-visa category that Afghan nationals, irrespective of religion, could apply for online. After a thorough security vetting, Afghans who qualify are expected to be granted a six-month visa. Tandon also said the Indian personnel were “very happy that it’s finally over and we’re back home safely, securely, without any accidents or harm to any of our people”. India had a large mission with 192 personnel in Kabul, and everyone was evacuated “literally within three days in a very orderly fashion in two phases”, he said. Among those brought back on Tuesday were employees of public sector companies such as Air India. “There are a lot of Indian citizens who found themselves in distress because of the fast-changing situation. So, our policy was that anyone who reached the embassy was taken into the embassy. I don’t know how they managed inside the embassy but we were sure that they were safe and secure and there was an avenue for an exit,” he said. “This would not have been possible without the work of the full embassy, different wings did different jobs. Some of the jobs I can’t even mention, but it all came together and we are finally here safe and secure,” Tandon added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ai-to-operate-flights-till-kabul-airport-remains-functional-indian-envoy-101629192333350.html
17-08-2021||India||Chhattisgarh sends notice to news portal for report citing TS Singh Deo||Chhattisgarh’s public relations department on Tuesday sent a notice to a news portal a day after minister TS Singh Deo sought action against it for citing him as the source for a story claiming chief minister Bhupesh Baghel will resign on August 17. The department asked the portal to issue a corrigendum or else face legal action, an official said on Tuesday.In the letter to the department on Monday, Deo demanded “strict action” against the portal amid speculation about a rift within the ruling Congress over the chief ministerial post. Deo called the story carried on August 15 a “planned conspiracy” to “pollute” the state’s political environment. Baghel is in charge of the department.There have been reports about tensions between Baghel and Deo, who was among the chief ministerial candidates when Congress returned to power in the state in 2018. Baghel completed two and half years as the chief minister on June 17. Deo is believed to have called Baghel and reminded him about the power-sharing formula apparently agreed in 2018 when another minister, Tamradhwaj Sahu, was also among the contenders for the top post.There have been media reports about the formula for sharing the chief ministerial post between Deo and Baghel for two and a half years each.Both Deo and Baghel have maintained the central leadership will take a final decision on the matter. Deo has been in Delhi since Monday and is believed to be meeting top Congress leaders for the implementation of the formula.Deo earlier this month camped in Delhi for five days and insisted he travelled to the national capital for a health check-up.The differences within the ruling party came to the fore when Deo walked out of the assembly demanding clarity from his own government over allegations that one of his relatives was involved in an alleged attack on Congress legislator Brihaspat Singh. Deo was unsatisfied with the government’s statement over the alleged road rage incident involving Singh’s convoy on July 24.Singh alleged his convoy was attacked at the behest of Deo because he praised Baghel and said the latter will continue to be the chief minister.After the intervention of the party’s state in-charge PL Punia, the issue was resolved, and Deo returned to assembly after Singh apologised for his statement against the minister.The Opposition Bhartiya Janata Party said the issue of power-sharing should be resolved for the state’s sake. “The tiff is an internal issue of Congress but as per the statements of party leaders, it seems there was a formula. Leaders of Congress should resolve the issue as soon as possible. Secondly, the people of the state are suffering from this tiff. We all know that Deo, who is also the health minister of the state, was ignored in important meetings of Cabinet due to which people suffered,” said former chief minister Raman Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-sends-notice-to-news-portal-for-report-citing-ts-singh-deo-101629191733375.html

AAP convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who is in Dehradun, said Uttarakhand will be developed by AAP as a spiritual capital for Indians living across the world. Kejriwal said AAP will also generate employment to youth if voted to power.Kejriwal said the decision to pick Kothiyal as the party's CM face was based on the feedback received from people who were fed up with politicians helming the state. "People here want a break from politicians who have only looted the state. They now want an Armyman as CM who will not spend his tenure filling his coffers but serve them," he said at a public rally in the hill town.AAP leader & Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal rallies from Clock Tower to Dilaram Bazar in Dehradun, Uttarakhand.At a public address held earlier in the day, Kejriwal announced Ajay Kothiyal (retd Colonel) as AAP's Chief Ministerial candidate for the Assembly Election 2021. pic.twitter.com/Srgl8IlH7WOn Monday, Kejriwal said that he would visit Uttarakhand the next day and make an important announcement that would turn out to be a milestone in the state’s development.During an earlier visit in July, Kejriwal, who has been on a campaign spree across states as part of AAP’s attempts to expand its base, had announced 300 units of free electricity to the people of Uttarakhand if the party was elected to power. Speaking about replicating AAP’s Delhi model of governance in Uttarakhand, Kejriwal had said if the party won the Assembly election, it would bring in major change in schools and health infrastructure.Earlier, the AAP had said it would field Col Ajay Kothiyal from Gangotri if the then chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat contested from that assembly seat."BJP ruined Uttarakhand in the last five years. I am fortunate that my party gave me a chance to contest from Gangotri in the bypoll. I have toured several villages of Gangotri. People are very unhappy. I am confident that people will win this time," Col Kothiyal had said in a tweet.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ajay-kothiyal-ex-army-man-to-be-aap-s-uttarakhand-cm-candidate-kejriwal-101629191181449.html

The C-17 aircraft carrying the second batch of Indians first touched down at the IAF airbase at Jamnagar at 11:15am, the officials added. “Your welcome has an impact on all of us. Thank you to the Indian Air Force who flew us out under conditions that are not normal,” Tandon was quoted as saying by news agency ANI after landing at Jamnagar.A video tweeted by news agency ANI later showed those airlifted inside a bus and shouting “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” and “Vande Mataram”. Their evacuation came after 24-hour-long negotiations.#WATCH | Evacuated Indians from Kabul, Afghanistan chant 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' after landing in Jamnagar, Gujarat. pic.twitter.com/IqvESz79IO“Those who were aboard the aircraft will be given lunch and taken to their destinations,” Gujarat minister of state for food and civil supply Dharmendrasinh Jadeja said, according to news agency PTI. Jadeja and Jamnagar mayor reached the Jamnagar airbase before the plane landed.PTI reported that the Gujarat government said in a release that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is “personally looking after the evacuation of Indian nationals and officials stranded in Afghanistan” after the Taliban took over the war-ravaged country.The IAF aircraft flew from the Hamid Karzai International Airport around 8am Kabul time with the help of US forces manning the air traffic control. India is now waiting for US forces to allow civilian flights to Kabul for further evacuation. The first batch of Indians came on Sunday via an Air India flight.With no chain of command in Kabul, the Indian ministry of external affairs (MEA) and security officials started bringing evacuees to the Kabul airport from Monday as negotiations were undertaken with sundry Taliban and other terrorist groups manning the 15 check posts from the Indian mission in Kabul to the international airport. India apparently had kept two C-17s on stand-by so that officials could be evacuated as soon as the US manned ATC gave a green signal.According to sources based in Kabul, it was part of the withdrawal deal that the Turkish forces would man the HKI airport but Ankara withdrew at the very last minute leading to utter confusion. With all local staff abandoning the ATC and other positions and illiterate Taliban having no idea about manning the air traffic services, it was left to the US to take control.It was due to the ensuing chaos that led to the death of desperate Afghans at the HKI airport as the civilians feared for their life and limb at the hands of the Taliban. It was only after this that the US decided to stop civilian flights from Kabul on Monday and decided to only allow military flights. Other Indians will be evacuated from Afghanistan after the HKI airport is opened to civilian flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iafs-c-17-aircraft-with-over-120-indian-diplomats-from-kabul-lands-in-delhi-101629189048468.html

17-08-2021||India||Air India pilots fly beyond their time limit to get Indians home from US||Closure of the Afghanistan airspace on Monday led to flight cancellations and diversions. Two Air India flights from the United States that would have normally used Afghanistan air space to arrive in Delhi had to be re-routed and made to halt in the UAE due to fuel considerations. The two flights carrying roughly 600 passengers finally landed in Delhi only a few hours behind schedule since the pilots chose to work beyond their flight duty time limit (FDTL).According to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the flying time limit or the FDTL allows a pilot only one landing in a long haul flight. However, Air India pilots flying AI 126(Chicago- Delhi) and AI 174 (San Francisco to Delhi) decided to go beyond it to avoid inconvenience to passengers and cost to the company, AI Pilots’ union said.“The regulator leaves it to the operating pilots to take a call. It is only on a voluntary basis that the pilots operate beyond their time limit. No one can force them to compromise their FDTL,” an ex DGCA official explained that only the pilots of the two airlines were in a position to extend their FDTLs.Officials aware of the development said the flight from Chicago was informed about Afghanistan airspace being closed late, due to which, it diverted to Sharjah just before entering the Afghan airspace.“However, the flight from San Francisco that landed in Sharjah at around 3pm was given the information on time,” the official said. “The Chicago flight, after being refuelled, took off for Delhi after around three hours and the other flight from the US was in Sharjah for over an hour,” he added.A senior official from the airline said the pilots must have considered the fact that taking a break and obeying their FDTL would only cause complications. “If the pilots would have not taken the decision to fly beyond their FDTLs, then it would have not only cost the airline more (since the passengers would have to be accommodated in UAE) but also inconvenienced the passengers,” he said.While the flight from Chicago landed in Delhi at 6.15pm, the San Francisco flight that was ideally to land in Delhi at 3pm, landed at around 7.40pm.Air India’s Boeing pilots’ union tweeted, “To avoid major inconvenience to the passengers and cost to the company, they opted to extend their FDTL and safely operated another sector. Over 24 hours in uniform, they landed safely in #Delhi. All in a day’s work for @airindiain pilots. The closure of #kabulairport and #Afghanistan airspace caused major disruption. Kudos to our member pilots and the crew of AI126. With limited time to react and with inadequate fuel for Delhi they managed a diversion to #Sharjah.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-pilots-fly-beyond-their-time-limit-to-get-indians-home-from-us-101629187653259.html
17-08-2021||India||Kerala HC allows 9-year-old girl to accompany her father to Sabarimala temple||The Kerala High Court on Tuesday allowed a minor girl to accompany her father to the Sabarimala temple later this month. The order was passed on the plea filed by the nine-year-old, seeking permission to accompany her father to the sanctum sanctorum of the hill shrine. The father will visit the temple on August 23, according to a report by the news agency ANI.During the hearing lawyers, arguing on the behalf of the girl, said that she wished to go to the Sabarimala before she turns 10 years old. After which, the lawyers said that she might not be able to visit the shrine for more than four decades. "We are of the considered opinion that an interim order can be issued permitting the petitioner to accompany her father to Sabarimala for darshan on August 23," the high court reportedly said after hearing the matter.The order was in line with the similar order passed by the court in April this year in which it allowed the children to accompany vaccinated persons in all activities they undertake. The state government also passed a similar order.The Ayyappa temple opened for devotees on August 15 for the annual Niraputhari festival. In view of the Covid-19 restrictions, only 15,000 devotees are allowed for darshan in a single day. The shrine will close after the completion of the monthly pujas by August 23 evening.Since 2018, the temple has been in the middle of controversies after the Supreme Court struck down a law that prevented women aged 10-50 from entering the temple. The order sparked massive outrage across the state with devotees taking to the streets against the judgement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-allows-9-year-old-girl-to-accompany-her-father-to-sabarimala-temple-101629187408063.html

17-08-2021||India||Covid cases decline, Assam allows inter-district movement after 3 months||The Assam government on Tuesday decided to lift restrictions on inter-district movement of vehicles. The curbs were put in place three months ago to contain the spread of coronavirus. The new direction, which will come into force from 5am on August 18, is a part of the fresh standard operating procedures (SOPs) that include decreasing curfew timings by an hour and lifting odd-even formula for vehicle movement. “Inter-district movement of private vehicles and movement of people shall be allowed, except to and from Kamrup (Metropolitan) district. Inter-district movement of public transport will remain suspended for the time being,” said health minister Keshav Mahanta. The state government had imposed restrictions on inter-district movement of vehicles on May 21 this year and only vehicles carrying goods and some categories of exempted people were allowed to travel from one district to another. The new SOP reduces the present curfew timings of 6pm to 5am daily to 7pm-5am daily. “Meetings or gatherings in open spaces would be allowed for up to 200 persons. In closed spaces, 50% of the hall’s capacity or 200 fully vaccinated persons (whichever is lower) will be allowed to hold meetings,” Mahanta said. For marriages and funerals, up to 25 persons will be allowed now. Religious places are allowed to open with entry of 20 fully vaccinated persons per hour --for iconic places such as Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati -- and 10 fully vaccinated persons for other places. Resorts, hotels, and restaurants will be allowed to remain open till 6pm with 50% capacity. However, cinema halls and multiplexes will continue to remain closed. The government directed that final year students of MBBS, engineering, nursing, aeronautical engineering etc. will be allowed to attend physical classes provided they all, and their teachers, are fully vaccinated. Fully vaccinated passengers who can produce a recent RT-PCR negative test report will not be required to undergo and COVID19 test on arrival at any airport in the state. Government employees who have taken at least on vaccine dose have been directed to report for work regularly. Women employees with children below 3 years of age will be allowed to work from home. Assam has been witnessing a gradual decline in the number of fresh Covid cases in recent weeks. The number of new cases recorded daily has dropped to around 700-800 and the test positivity rate (TPR) has also dipped below 1%. At present, the state has around 7,700 active cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-cases-decline-assam-allows-inter-district-movement-after-3-months-101629185013194.html

17-08-2021||India||Won’t allow anyone to use Afghan soil against another country: Taliban||The Taliban won’t allow anyone to use Afghanistan’s soil against any other country, though India is welcome to complete its reconstruction and infrastructure projects in the country, a spokesman for the group has said.The remarks by Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen, made during an interview with Pakistan’s Hum News channel late on Monday night, were the first official comments by a leader of the group since it assumed power in Kabul on Sunday following the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government. India had opened channels of communication with some Taliban leaders and factions over the past few months but New Delhi is yet to take a call on any recognition for the new dispensation in Kabul. On Tuesday, India withdrew its ambassador and diplomatic staff from Afghanistan, reflecting misgivings about Taliban guarantees for the security of foreign missions and their personnel in Kabul. Also Read | Why India must not abandon Afghanistan againAsked about the Taliban’s views regarding India, Shaheen said in Urdu: “We have said that we will not allow any country or any group to use the soil of Afghanistan against anyone. This is clear.” Shaheen, responsible for the group’s interaction with foreign media, added: “Secondly, [India] has made projects, many reconstruction and infrastructure projects, and if they want, they can complete the incomplete projects because they are for the people.” He further said: “But if anyone wants to use Afghan soil for their objectives or for their military objectives or for their rivalries – our policy doesn’t allow anyone to do that.” India recently withdrew all professionals working on hundreds of development projects in all of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces. Besides major infrastructure projects such as constructing the Parliament building in Kabul and the Salma Dam, India was implementing scores of smaller community development projects to build facilities such as schools and health centres. With total pledges of $3 billion, India was also the largest regional donor in Afghanistan. The external affairs ministry recently made it clear that India has no role once projects are completed and it would be up to the Afghan people to protect them. In response to another question on whether the Taliban would ensure that any Indian presence in Afghanistan wouldn’t be used against Pakistan, Shaheen said: “They [India] have incomplete projects in Afghanistan such as roads and dams, they should complete them. But as I said, we will not allow anyone to use [Afghan soil] against any other country. This is our clear-cut policy.” There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Shaheen’s remarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-allow-anyone-to-use-afghan-soil-against-another-country-taliban-101629184292773.html

A sedition case is also pending against him since 2018. Charge sheets have been filed in five cases against him.The affidavit described Erendro as an “influential young social activist” with a huge fan following on social media that raises him to the status of a “celebrity”. “There was no malafide intention…the detention order was passed taking into account the situation that was prevailing at the time when the post was made on Facebook. The detenu was not subjected to any custodial torture. Therefore, ground for compensation is not made out.”A bench of Justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah took the affidavit on record and agreed to consider compensation on August 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipur-refuses-to-compensate-activist-detained-for-fb-post-101629182792391.html

The country reported 25,166 new infections in the last 24 hours, the Union ministry of health and family welfare said. The national recovery rate, which as of Tuesday stands at 97.51 per cent, is also the highest since March 2020. India's Covid-19 tally now stands at 32,250,679, according to the Union health ministry.This new record comes days after Dr Randeep Guleria, director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, said on August 14 that a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic will not be as brutal as the second one, cautioning that his prediction was dependent on the general population abiding by Covid-appropriate behaviour.The country’s Covid-19 positivity rate, which has remained below 3 per cent for the last 53 days, was recorded at a low of 1.98 per cent, after 1,563,985 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours. The World Health Organization (WHO) mandates a positivity rate of 5 per cent for an outbreak to be considered under control.The declining tally of daily Covid-19 cases has, however, failed to dull the apprehension of a third wave even as states like Maharashtra have gone forward with relaxations in curbs. The rise in cases of the Delta and Delta Plus variants of the coronavirus and shortage of vaccines has been a continuous cause of concern for the state. Maharashtra has also sent over 80,000 samples for genome sequencing since the second wave started and about 80 per cent of the samples tested positive for the Delta variant.Also Read: India administers 8.8mn Covid vaccine doses, highest ever in a single dayKerala has also been battling a high number of cases and a positivity rate of 14.03 per cent. As per the latest sero survey, at least 45% of the population do not possess Covid-19 antibodies and are susceptible to infection. Much like Maharashtra, the state government in Kerala too have been asking for more vaccine doses to inoculate its population.Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan met Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on August 16, and cautioned that with 56 per cent of the population still unaffected by the coronavirus disease, more people are likely to be infected in the coming days and vaccinating them is the only possible solution. Mandaviya assured Vijayan that 1.11 crore vaccines will be supplied to the state over the course of August and September.Fear of an imminent third wave also kept the West Bengal government from allowing local trains to operate even as it lifted curbs on theatres, multiplexes, and restaurants. “The Covid situation in Bengal is quite good but the danger of the third wave is still lurking. This is one of the reasons we have not allowed local trains,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee told reporters on August 13. She added that if the state gets vaccines the rural population can be inoculated with at least one dose and trains can then be allowed to operate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-lowest-daily-covid-19-cases-in-154-days-delta-variant-continues-to-worry-101629182270477.html

The National Investigation Agency questioned these women last year.Bindu S, the mother of Nimisha alias Fathima, one of the widows, cited her “contacts in Delhi” and said they told her about the release. She urged the government to get her daughter and grandchild back.“I plead the Union government to save them. Let them come back and face the law of the land. They are desperate to come back,” said Bindu S.Nimisha, a dentist, was seven-month pregnant when she left the country in 2016 with her husband. She later gave birth to a baby girl in Afghanistan. “Let the government punish my daughter for her wrongdoings. But her child is innocent. I can bring up the child as a responsible citizen,” she said.Also Read | Rahul Gandhi to participate in inauguration of farmers’ day programme in Kerala Nimisha was among the 21 people from middle-class backgrounds, who went missing from Kerala in 2016 and were later traced to Afghanistan.

Qureshi is an associate of controversial preacher Zakir Naik.Families of most members of the group have disowned them saying they brought disrepute and shame to the country.In 2020, a video of Nimisha and Merlin, another member of the group, surfaced on social media. In the video, both were purportedly heard saying they were disappointed with their lives in Afghanistan and were keen to return and face the law in India. The government then made it clear it has no plan to bring them back.The IS overran parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014 before it was driven out of its last Syrian stronghold in March 2019.Bindu S said she does not have more information. “I plead the union government to save them before they get into more trouble...they really repent now.”Deputy superintendent P P Sadanadan, who investigated some of the terror modules, in 2019 said more than three dozen people from Kerala joined the IS and a majority of them got killed.One of the relatives of Ijaz, a medical doctor, who also left India in 2016, said they have disowned them long back for bringing shame. “We are not interested to know about their fate either,” he said. Ijaz was reportedly killed leaving behind his widow Rafeela and two children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-widows-from-india-freed-from-afghan-jail-claims-kin-101629181712797.html

The IAF aircraft flew from Hamid Karzai International (HKI) Airport around 8am Kabul time with the help of US forces manning the ATC. Indian ambassador to Afghanistan Rudrendra Tandon is on the flight along with 120 other diplomats and officials.The evacuation comes after 24-hour-long negotiations.The IAF aircraft is expected to reach Delhi around 1pm. India is now waiting for US forces to allow civilian flights to Kabul for further evacuation. The first batch of Indians came on Sunday via an Air India flight.With no chain of command in Kabul, the Indian ministry of external affairs (MEA) and security officials started bringing evacuees to HKI airport from Monday as negotiations were undertaken with sundry Taliban and other terrorist groups manning the 15 check posts from the Indian mission in Kabul to the international airport. India apparently had kept two C-17s on stand-by so that officials could be evacuated as soon as the US manned ATC gave a green signal.According to sources based in Kabul, it was part of the withdrawal deal that the Turkish forces would man the HKI airport but Ankara withdrew at the very last minute leading to utter confusion. With all local staff abandoning the ATC and other positions and illiterate Taliban having no idea about manning the air traffic services, it was left to the US to take control.It was due to the ensuing chaos that led to the death of desperate Afghans at the HKI airport as the civilians feared for their life and limb at the hands of the Taliban. It was only after this that the US decided to stop civilian flights from Kabul on Monday and decided to only allow military flights. Other Indians will be evacuated from Afghanistan after the HKI airport is opened to civilian flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iafs-c-17-aircraft-with-over-120-indian-diplomats-from-kabul-lands-in-gujarat-101629179389404.html

The pandemic changed everything for him last year when schools were shut. Being cooped inside his home for 18 months now, without getting to meet his friends, seeing them only online has taken a toll on him.Manav isn’t an isolated case. Psychologists and education experts say online education has taken a toll on children with special needs. Parents of many children with learning disabilities have expressed concern over the online mode of education. Sneha, a mother of a 16-year-old boy with autism, said that she has observed a lack of sleep and mood swings in her son due to increased screen time.“One of the main concerns for children with special needs is that they have not been included in this struggle; they have been and still are on the periphery,” said Simmi Vasu, Principal of Orane Kids, a Noida-based school for children with autism and intellectual disabilities.For children with special needs, their challenges do not end with online classes. They also have to deal with various neurological and sensory issues that come with their specific disability, making the challenges multi-fold.According to a research by the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuroscience (NIMHANS) in 2020, 29% of children with special needs were not able to access online schooling, one of the possible reasons being their belonging to a lower socioeconomic strata. This figure is from the small portion of children with special needs who attend school and have access to education. This implies that such children will experience an immediate change in routine and loss of a social set-up, with limited resources to then deal with the changes.Children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) find it difficult to sustain their attention through online classes, and it can become difficult for teachers to engage them. Similarly, children with autism can find it difficult to get through the day with a change in routine. The problem arises when these issues are looked at from a normative lens, and not from how these are experienced by children with special needs.Dipti Srivastava, a special educator at Orane Kids, said, “We have not been able to fulfil their needs.” She said since the students now don’t have access to all tools and resources educators use at school, they have to learn through kinaesthetic ways.Further, the support that children with special needs require in terms of occupational therapy and special education may not be available and accessible online, leading to a disruption in their therapy and growth. Conflicts at home have also impacted children with special needs. Varsha KV, a practising psychologist, said parental conflicts can increase emotional concerns among children with special needs, as “the space at home may not feel safe”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pandemic-hit-kids-with-special-needs-as-online-classes-fail-to-cater-to-them-101629178471905.html

Some have tried to flee the country as stowaways, either by clinging on the belly or the wheels of planes. At least three men were seen falling off a US military plane as it took off. An official from the US government told Reuters that their troops fired in the air to disperse people “trying to force their way onto a military flight evacuating the US diplomats and embassy staff.”Singh said his family and five more Indians have been figuring ways to leave Ghazni since the Taliban took over Kabul this week. He told HT over the phone that there have been assurances but no help yet.Also Read | Billions spent by US on Afghan army ultimately benefited TalibanTaliban took over Ghazni after Governor Dawood Laghmani and his police chief surrendered. The road that connects Ghazni to Kabul has since been under the Taliban’s control.“I have a small shop here in Naya Shahar area where I sold spices. There had been a talk among local shopkeepers that the Taliban are just a few kilometres away. Following this, I collected my belongings and along with my wife and daughters, we came to gurdwara last week,” said Singh.“Canada has said it would be taking in 20,000 refugees. Sikh groups there have said that they would be sponsoring our travel and stay. Whatever flight, we are able to catch first, be it to Canada or India, we will try leaving.”Singh said there has been firing at the Kabul airport as well. “So, it is better if we stay in the gurdwara rather than risk our lives by moving out or stay at the Kabul airport.”Singh said the Taliban have taken over the Ghazni completely. “I happened to come across them few times in the last one month as I went to Kabul twice to renew my daughters’ visas. They did not do anything,” he said. “My Afghan partner in the business has been staying home since the Taliban takeover. He too fears coming out. There is a lull; everyone is staying inside as all fear for their lives.”India has said it will repatriate India citizens and also the Afghan Sikhs and Hindus who wish to leave Afghanistan.The commercial operations from the Kabul airport have been suspended which has halted India’s repatriation efforts. Singh shared videos of his stay in gurdwara in which Indians stranded there can be seen eating together. He said they stocked up ration at the gurdwara before the imminent Taliban take over. “There is a school run by the gurdwara which is connected through its rear. It has few toilets attached to it. We are using the same for now.”Singh said Ghazni has over 200 Indians who want to leave the country. “I have been in constant touch with the Indian embassy in Kabul as well as with officials in New Delhi. They have been cooperative but for now, all are helpless... They are asking us not to worry and have said that they will soon make arrangements to get us back,” he said. “I have a large family back in Delhi. My sisters and mother must be really worried about us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-family-stranded-in-afghanistan-hopes-to-leave-soon-101629177571867.html

17-08-2021||India||How India brought back its ambassador, staff from embassy in Kabul||India announced on Tuesday that its ambassador and staff at the embassy in Kabul were being brought back home even as a second C-17 Globemaster heavy lift aircraft took off from the Afghanistan capital with more than 120 people on board. On Monday, another C-17 aircraft had brought back some 40 people, including diplomats and security personnel, before operations at Kabul airport were suspended and control of the airspace over the city was handed over to the military. “In view of the prevailing circumstances, it has been decided that our Ambassador in Kabul and his Indian staff will move to India immediately,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi tweeted. Ambassador Rudrendra Tandon had taken up his assignment in Kabul in August last year, and people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the decision to bring back the envoy and diplomatic staff was made because of the perception that their security could not guaranteed in the Afghan capital. The people said the second C-17 aircraft of the Indian Air Force was bringing back more than 120 people, including officials and security personnel from the embassy and some Indian nationals, from Kabul. The people were brought into the secure areas of Kabul airport late on Monday, they added. Also Read | Taliban must ensure soil not used by terror groups: IndiaOn Monday, the people who were to return on the second military evacuation flight were initially turned back by Taliban fighters guarding Kabul’s diplomatic quarter and later drove to the airport following intense efforts by the Indian side all through the day. External affairs minister S Jaishankar too was involved in these efforts. At almost 3am on Tuesday, he tweeted about his discussions in this regard with US secretary of state Antony Blinken: “Discussed latest developments in Afghanistan with @SecBlinken. Underlined the urgency of restoring airport operations in Kabul. Deeply appreciate the American efforts underway in this regard.” There was no official word on the two C-17 flights. The people cited above said both C-17s had flown into Kabul using a more circuitous route through Iranian airspace and over the Arabian Sea in order to avoid flying over Pakistan and spending too much time in Afghan airspace. The repatriation of the ambassador and other staff from Kabul reflected India’s lack of trust in the Taliban’s announcement that all embassies and diplomats would be provided security. Taliban spokesman Suhail Saheen had tweeted on Monday night: “We assure all diplomats, embassies, consulates, and charitable workers, whether they are international or national, that not only no problem will be created for them on the part of IEA but a secure environment will be provided to them, Inshallah.” There was also no official word on the status of the Indian embassy in Kabul, where many Western countries have shuttered their missions. After the Covid-19 outbreak last year, India had closed its consulates in Herat and Jalalabad, while the consulates in Kandahar and Mazar-e-Sharif were left in the care of local Afghan staff as fighting with the Taliban intensified in recent weeks. In a separate development, the Union home ministry (MHA) announced on Twitter on Tuesday that it had reviewed “visa provisions in view of the current situation in Afghanistan” and introduced a new category of electronic visa called “e-Emergency X-Misc Visa” to “fast-track visa applications for entry into India”. Also Read | Repatriation of Indians hit as chaos clouds Kabul airportThe online portal for e-visa applications was updated and when an applicant selects “Afghanistan” in the drop down menu, the “e-Emergency X-Misc Visa” category shows automatically. Afghanistan is not yet listed among “eligible countries” on the homepage of the e-visa portal, but the application form was updated to include Afghanistan and the new e-visa category, officials said. Jaishankar also tweeted that the Indian side is in “constant touch with the Sikh and Hindu community leaders in Kabul”, and their “welfare will get our priority attention”. India had earlier said it will facilitate travel to India by members of the two Afghan minorities. The minister further tweeted that he was monitoring the situation in Kabul continuously. “Understand the anxiety of those seeking to return to India. Airport operations are the main challenge. Discussions on with partners in that regard,” he added. “Given the Kabul situation, important we have accurate information about Indians there,” Jaishankar said in another tweet and called for such information to be provided to the external affairs ministry’s Special Afghanistan Cell at the phone number +919717785379 and the email ID: MEAHelpdeskIndia@gmail.com. There was no word if any Indian nationals were still in Kabul, which is currently the only way out of Afghanistan as the Taliban have taken over all land border crossings and smaller airports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-bring-back-ambassador-staff-from-embassy-in-kabul-101629174033256.html

The first batch of Indians came on Sunday via an Air India flight.Also read | Jaishankar speaks to Blinken, gets US support for evacuationWith no chain of command in Kabul, the Indian ministry of external affairs (MEA) and security officials started bringing evacuees to HKI airport from Monday as negotiations were undertaken with sundry Taliban and other terrorist groups manning the 15 check posts from the Indian mission in Kabul to the international airport. India apparently had kept two C-17s on stand-by so that officials could be evacuated as soon as the US manned ATC gave a green signal.Also read | Kabul's situation better under Taliban than it was under Ghani: RussiaAccording to sources based in Kabul, it was part of the withdrawal deal that the Turkish forces would man the HKI airport but Ankara withdrew at the very last minute leading to utter confusion. With all local staff abandoning the ATC and other positions and illiterate Taliban having no idea about manning the air traffic services, it was left to the US to take control.It was due to the ensuing chaos that led to the death of desperate Afghans at the HKI airport as the civilians feared for their life and limb at the hands of the Taliban. It was only after this that the US decided to stop civilian flights from Kabul on Monday and decided to only allow military flights. Other Indians will be evacuated from Afghanistan after the HKI airport is opened to civilian flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-evacuates-second-batch-of-diplomats-officials-from-afghanistan-via-iaf-101629170712291.html

17-08-2021||India||Nagaland set for all party government to push peace process forward||Nagaland will form an all party government called Nagaland United Government (NUG) with the aim to speed up Naga peace process.Ruling Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP), its ally Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the party in Opposition, Naga People’s Front (NPF), along with two independent MLAs, signed an agreement on Monday to form the NUG for achieving inclusive, acceptable and honorable solution to the Naga political issue as committed in their respective party manifestos.The 60 member-house has 25 NPF, 20 NDPP, 12 BJP and two independent MLAs. One seat fell vacant after a sitting NDPP MLA passed away on July 1.The terms of the agreement say that the united government will promote the Naga peace talks with a positive approach in the greater interest of achieving peace. It promises to move towards finding a political solution at the earliest time possible; to urge all the Naga political groups to make serious efforts to unite and reconcile; that the political parties shall ensure unity of its members in the legislative assembly on the issue and make all possible endeavours to achieve the objective.The agreement also states that the political parties shall impress upon the Central government and all the negotiating groups to bring about a solution at the earliest. The agreement was signed by the presidents of all political parties.“The Naga political issue... has been pending for decades, and to achieve a peaceful amicable solution, the parties to this resolution which constitutes all the members of Nagaland Legislative Assembly, have resolved to stand united for the said purpose. Thus, in light of the ongoing peace talks, all the political parties to this resolution have endorsed the concept of united government so as to facilitate the Naga political issue to achieve an honourable and acceptable solution,” the agreement said.While the NPF earlier announced that it will join the government without any pre-conditions, people in the know of the developments said a minor reshuffle was likely to induct a couple of senior NPF MLAs including former leader of Opposition and former chief minister TR Zeliang.In 2015, eight Congress MLAs had merged with the then ruling NPF to form the first all party government in the state. In the same year, the Centre signed the “framework agreement” with the Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN-IM) after 18 years of truce between them.While the substantive issues were resolved, the NSCN (IM) has remained firm on its demand for a separate Naga flag and constitution, which is said to be the main reason for the delay in inking a final deal for a settlement on the protracted Naga dispute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-set-for-all-party-government-to-push-peace-process-forward-101629170791235.html
17-08-2021||India||Supreme Court notice to CBI on plea opposing bail to Dabholkar killer||The Supreme Court on Monday issued a notice to Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on a petition filed by the kin of murdered anti-superstition activist Narender Dabholkar opposing bail granted by the Bombay high court to one of the men accused in the case, Vikram Vinay Bhave. The petition filed by Dabholkar’s daughter Mukta and son Hameed challenged the May 6 order passed by the high court allowing the bail plea of Bhave on furnishing a personal bond of ₹1 lakh and two sureties in the like amount. He was also required to report to the local police station every day in the first month of bail, twice a week in the second and third month after release, and thereafter, once a month. Dabholkar was killed in Pune on August 20, 2013 and the accused in question was arrested in May 2019 for his role in conducting a reconnaissance of the area where Dabholkar used to take his walk, and to provide logistical support to the two accused who committed the murder. Also Read | CBI declares ₹5L reward for info on Dhanbad judge’s deathThe bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy issued notice to the CBI, the state of Maharashtra and Bhave. While initially the court was of the view that the role attributed to the accused was small, senior advocate Anand Grover appearing for the Dabholkar kin informed that the crime was committed by Bhave while he was out on bail in a criminal case involving Explosive Substances Act. In that crime, he was convicted and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. He was released on bail on May 8, 2013 and within three months (of bail) he conspired to commit the murder of Dabholkar, Grover said. Considering this aspect, the court agreed to issue a notice. Grover even attributed a larger plot against Bhave accusing the organisation to which he belonged - Sanatan Sanstha – being involved in similar killings of persons opposed to the organisation’s ideology, referring to the murder of Gauri Lankesh in Bengaluru in September 2017. Since Bhave was not named an accused in Lankesh murder case, the bench told Grover, “This is a very dangerous precedent if we start imputing motive to a particular ideology. What you are suggesting will have serious repercussions on other cases.” It was at the instance of the present petitioners that the investigation into Dabholkar’s death was transferred to CBI in June 2014 by an order of the Bombay high court. The CBI named three persons for the crime – Virendra Tavade, Sharad Kalaskar and Sachin Andure In all, there are six accused persons named by CBI.Bhave is charged for murder (IPC Section 302), destruction of evidence (IPC Section 201), criminal conspiracy (IPC Section 120B) and terrorist act (Section 16) of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. Dabholkar’s kin in their petition filed through advocate Krishna Kumar said, “Considering the criminal antecedents of the appellant (Bhave) there is reasonable apprehension of tampering the evidence and witnesses. The charges levelled against the appellant are of grave and serious nature and involves connection series of murders, therefore it has far-reaching consequences on the society at large and involves national interest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-notice-to-cbi-on-plea-opposing-bail-to-dabholkar-killer-101629170011102.html

The yatra will be covering Rishikesh, Haridwar, Udham Singh Nagar and Nainital before concluding in Almora on August 18. BJP leaders will also pay a visit to the shrines of Shri Dakshin Kali and the Shiv temple at Shayampur in Haridwar.BJP district general secretary Vikas Tiwari told Hindustan Times on August 5 that the yatra is meant to be a morale-boosting exercise for party workers ahead of the polls, as they will be spreading information about various policies of the government. “Party workers are gearing up for the yatra. Throughout the route, a grand welcome will be given to the yatra at major points.

Now it seems again to be focusing on party electoral events rather than on improving infrastructure to counter the third wave and ensure mass vaccination.

17-08-2021||India||Jailed IS members among Indians freed||A dozen Indians including several women from Kerala, who travelled to Afghanistan to fight for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in 2016, are among hundreds of jihadis freed by Taliban from Kabul’s two prisons, Pul-e-Charkhi and Badam Bagh, according to an initial assessment by Indian counterterrorism and intelligence agencies.Counterterrorism officials monitoring the situation closely said that with the Taliban now in power in Afghanistan, these highly radicalised men and women, who travelled to the Nangarhar province along with their partners and children to live under the Sharia law, have finally got what they wanted.The rapid collapse of Ashraf Ghani’s government and surrender by Afghan security forces mean that Indian agencies have no means to confirm the exact location of the jihadis. “There is also a possibility that at some point, they will try to enter India via a third country. We have to maintain a close watch now,” said an officer at of the Indian agencies who spoke on condition of anonymity.While at least eight people from the Kerala ISIS module, wanted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), are among those released, an estimate suggests that there were around 24-25 Indians lodged in various prisons in Afghanistan. About a dozen of these were lodged at Pul-e-Charkhi and Badam Bagh.Indian agencies are not clear about the status of the other prisoners.The Kerala women lodged in the two prisons were questioned by Indian agencies last year.The National Investigation Agency was supposed to travel to Kabul last year following an attack at a gurdwara on March 25, 2020, in which 27 Sikh devotees including an Indian citizen were killed. However, it was forced to abandon its plan due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The counterterrorism officials believe terrorists such as Aijaz Ahangar will conspire against India with the help of Pakistan’s spy agency ISI while the widows from Kerala might be married off to Taliban fighters.The biggest threat from India’s point of view, according to the intelligence officers, is Taliban’s deputy leader Sirajuddin Haqqani. He might use Indians for further training to target Indian assets and individuals in Afghanistan.“It is too early to predict anything right now, but Pakistan will try to use Haqqani network for train and launch terrorists in Afghanistan and then launch them in India,” said a second Indian officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jailed-is-members-among-indians-freed-101629152279128.html
17-08-2021||India||Centre mulls single law to supervise all media||The Union government is considering a super legislation for all traditional and digital media companies so as to ensure a level playing field.The idea is to have an umbrella law that will cover print and electronic media, digital media, cinema, even so-called over-the-top or OTT platforms such as Netflix and Hotstar, government officials familiar with the matter said.According to one of the officials, the new law will draw elements from the Cable Television Network Act, Cinematograph Act, Press Council Act, and the new digital media guidelines. “The space is evolving,” added this person. “There is a need for platform-wise self-regulation. But at the same time, the technology is converging, the viewers and readers are converging. Earlier, different platforms were using different technologies, but now increasingly we are seeing them move towards a similar approach.”The process, however, is still at a discussion stage. Amit Khare, secretary, information and broadcasting (I&B) ministry, did not respond to HT’s request for comments.The new law may have been borne from the realisation that while print media has the Press Council, digital news media does not have a corresponding body.The I&B ministry has already amended the Cable Television Network Act and proposed draft amendments to the Cinematograph Act to ensure they are not at odds with the new social media and intermediary guidelines and digital media code of ethics, which were notified by the government under the Information Technology Act in February to bring hitherto unregulated digital platforms under a three-tier grievance redressal system.The new IT guidelines require platforms to appoint grievance redressal officers in case of OTT and digital news media platforms, institute a three-tier mechanism for grievance redressal with an inter-ministerial committee at its apex and give the I&B ministry takedown powers over the content circulated online. The government’s oversight mechanism, however, will also including members from industry bodies such as Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Confederation of Indian Industry and the Press Council. The rules have been challenged in court by several media companies.To create a balance between the regulation of online and offline platforms, the government on June 17 amended the Cable Television Networks Rules, 1994, to mandate that the earlier ad-hoc structure of self-regulation now be mandated under law, with a similar three-tier structure .According to an official at the I&B ministry, there are around 900 channels which are already part of a system of self-regulation and the amendment just added builds on that. The amendment, notified in a gazette notification issued on June 17, states that cable TV channels under the programme rules must have self-regulation by broadcasters themselves, regulation by the self-regulating bodies of the broadcasters, and an oversight mechanism by the central government. Broadcasters also have to acknowledge complaints within 24 hours of being filed.Similarly, amendments have been proposed to the Cinematograph Act, 1952, that will enable the introduction of a broader age-related classification, grant the central government the ability to ask the central board of film certification (CBFC) to re-examine a film, and curb piracy in the industry. The proposed amendments to the Act will introduce an age classification system akin to the one specified under the new intermediary and digital media guidelines. They also grant the government powers to ask the CBFC to re-examine a film on the grounds of national security and threat to public order.Supreme Court lawyer and co-founder of Cybersaathi, NS Nappinai, said a common legal framework would be a good move “but the government should also be cognisant of existing frameworks and see if a complete overhaul is needed”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-mulls-single-law-to-supervise-all-media-101629149955442.html

The petitioner is at liberty to seek other remedies available to him under the Code of Criminal Procedure,” the bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Krishna Murari and V Ramasubramanian said.Deshmukh and his son Hrishikesh are yet to respond to three summons issued by the central agency.The ED had registered the case earlier this year following a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation into allegations of a bribery-cum-extortion racket operated by the former minister.In their plea filed through advocate Avadh Bihari Kaushik, the duo had sought an order of “no coercive action” as it challenged the constitutional validity of certain provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002.Appearing for the ED, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said: “There are serious allegations of money laundering against him (Deshmukh). He was found to be operating 13 shell companies. These are in addition to 11 firms related to Deshmukh’s family which are already under probe. He has much to answer before the Special Judge, PMLA.”Deshmukh’s counsel and senior advocate Vikram Chaudhari, however, told the bench that this is a classic case of “political witch-hunt”.“I stand on equal footing with all other matters where the Court has protected accused facing ED charges.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-denies-interim-relief-to-former-maha-minister-in-corruption-case-101629149157237.html
17-08-2021||India||Mamata introduces ‘one person, one post’ in TMC; splits districts into multiple smaller units||Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee dropped several state ministers from holding the post of district presidents, even as she introduced the ‘one person one post’ policy while splitting some of the larger districts into smaller organisational units in a bid to decentralise the present structure. Prominent among leaders whose names were dropped from the post of district presidents were TMC MP Mahua Moitra who was the district president of Nadia, state irrigation minister Saumen Mahapatra, who was the president of East Midnapore district, state forest minister Jyotipriyo Mullick who was the president of North 24 Parganas, state cooperation minister Arup Roy who was in charge of Howrah and PHE minister Pulak Roy who was the president of Howrah rural. Senior leaders of the party said that the changes were made in view of the civic body election, which are overdue, as well as the 2023 panchayat polls and Lok Sabha polls in 2024. “In July, political strategist Prashant Kishor and chief minister Mamata Banerjee held a meeting in Kolkata to discuss the changes. The meeting, which continued for three hours, was held at the chief minister’s residence at Kalighat in south Kolkata. Her nephew and TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee was also present,” said a senior leader. According to the new set up, the larger administrative districts including Kolkata, were split into multiple organizational units and new committees, with a president heading each of these, have been created. “Even though the party has managed to win 213 out of the 292 assembly seats in some districts the performance was not satisfactory. The new set up has been planned to focus on smooth operation and check infighting among local leaders, something that has affected the party’s image at the grass root level,” said another senior party leader. While West Bengal has 23 administrative districts, the TMC has split them into 35 organisational units. Districts like Murshidabad and Nadia have been divided into two parts, while North 24 Parganas have been split into four areas. Even though the TMC returned to power for the third consecutive time, Banerjee lost to her protege-turned-adversary Suvendu Adhikari from Nandigram in East Midnapore. The district has been split into two parts, Tamluk and Contai. Nandigram from where Banerjee lost falls under Tamluk. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has a similar organizational structure with around 39 such smaller units carved out from larger administrative districts. It has two units in Murshidabad and Nadia. Each of these is headed by a president. In North 24 Parganas, which has 34 assembly and five Lok Sabha seats, the BJP has four units. The BJP refers to these units as organizational districts. “It was not possible for a minister or a MP to look after an entire district. They would be there to guide but the party wants to give more importance to young leaders and local leaders, following Kishor’s advice to shake up the rank and file,” said a TMC leader. The BJP, however, took a jibe at the TMC’s latest announcement saying that the ‘one person one post’ policy doesn’t seem to be applicable for Mamata Banerjee herself, who holds multiple portfolios from party’s chairperson, chairperson of the TMC parliamentary party and chief minister with several departments under her including home and hill affairs, information and cultural affairs and land and land reforms among others. “This is a kind of oligarchy but even an oligarchy requires some kind of consensus. The TMC is like a private limited company which was set up by a woman who takes all the decisions. She is the owner, and her wish is the last word in the party. Hence talking about such changes like ‘one person, one post’ is a waste of time,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson. “Why don’t BJP leaders mind their own business and focus on how to manage their own party? Will they now decide as to who would hold which post in the TMC?” said Chandrima Bhattacharya, senior TMC leader and minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-introduces-one-person-one-post-in-tmc-splits-districts-into-multiple-smaller-units-101629147508431.html
17-08-2021||India||Ready to form probe panel on Pegasus to dispel narrative: Govt||The Union government on Monday refrained from confirming or denying in the Supreme Court, its use of the Pegasus spyware for alleged surveillance of Indian citizens even as it offered to set up an expert committee to look into all aspects of the controversy and “dispel any wrong narrative spread by certain vested interests”.A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta repeatedly during the proceedings whether the government will come clean on the purchase or use of Pegasus. The S-G, however, maintained that a committee of experts should rather be allowed to delve into the issue, adding “whatever interception was done, it was done in the interest of national security”.The bench asked Mehta why the government shouldn’t file an additional affidavit so that the court could have clarity regarding all the averments made by them. “An affidavit of facts can be filed by you. If you don’t want to file the additional affidavit, then only the question of the committee will come up,” the CJI told the S-G.The S-G, however, urged the bench to rather have a technical committee of “some neutral and eminent experts” who could examine all the aspects and submit a report before the court instead of imploring the government to clarify anything on the use of Pegasus.At this point, the bench adjourned the proceedings for Tuesday, asking Mehta to revert if there is a “change of mind” on making a statement on the use of Pegasus.In its three-page affidavit filed nearly an hour before the top court was to consider a clutch of petitions for a court-monitored independent investigation into the alleged snooping, the Union government contended that the petitions “are based on conjectures and surmises or on other unsubstantiated media reports or incomplete or uncorroborated material” and, hence, failed to make out any case to invoke writ jurisdiction.“It is, however, submitted that with a view to dispel any wrong narrative spread by certain vested interests and with an object of examining the issues raised, the Union of India will constitute a committee of experts in the field which will go in to all aspects of the issue,” stated the affidavit, filed by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.While the affidavit said that the government “unequivocally” denies “any and all of the allegations”, it did not answer whether the Union government or any agency authorised by it used Pegasus for surveillance and was in possession of any information obtained using the spyware.The law officer argued that the petitioners were unlikely to withdraw their cases even if the Centre was to state on an affidavit that it did not use Pegasus and, therefore, the court should approve the creation of the expert committee by laying down the terms of references for the panel of experts, who will be given access to all the relevant information available with the government and its agencies.“There will be issues of national security if this court decides to go into it. With all respect, there cannot be an adjudicatory process invoked by the petitioners to seek answer whether Pegasus was bought or not. There cannot be a question like you first tell us whether you bought Pegasus or not... Any debate or deliberation will invoke issues of national security. It is a known fact that lawful interceptions take place,” Mehta submitted before the bench, which also included justices Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose.The S-G emphasised that the government “has nothing to hide” and that the proposal to set up the committee is to show their bona fides in a “sensitive” matter, which he claimed, is being made “sensational” by the petitioners for reasons best known to them. He pointed out that the government’s position on the alleged snooping has already been clarified in Parliament by IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw by rejecting all the accusations.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for senior journalists N Ram and Sashi Kumar, emphasised that the question of a committee or its composition will come only after the government tells the court whether it used Pegasus or not.“I am concerned about two pillars of democracy, judiciary and journalism. These are the institutions which protect the rights of the people. They cannot be penetrated in this manner by spyware. Let the government state on oath they have not used Pegasus. Our future arguments have to be on the basis of their statement,” said Sibal, adding a confirmation or denial on the use of the spyware will not affect national security.On his part, senior advocate Shyam Divan, who represented the Editors Guild of India, argued that issues of violation of privacy and constitutional rights cannot be dealt with by the government through “a skimpy, two-page affidavit”.Appearing for journalist SNM Abdi whose name was reportedly on the list of people targeted for snooping, senior counsel Rakesh Dwivedi also highlighted that the government has said nothing about using the spyware and that the purpose and role of the committee can be examined only after there is a specific answer in this regard.“If the government is reluctant and is saying they don’t want to file an affidavit, how do we compel them?” the bench told the petitioners’ lawyers, adding it will hear them on Tuesday.The petitioners in the case include advocate ML Sharma; former minister Yashwant Sinha, Rajya Sabha MP John Brittas, the EGI, journalists Ram and Kumar, journalists Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, Rupesh Kumar Singh, Ipshita Shatakshi, SNM Abdi, and Prem Shankar Jha, and civil rights activists Jagdeep S Chhokar and Narendra Mishra.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi appeared for WhatsApp in the case and said that the messaging platform has nothing to do with Pegasus.The Pegasus row erupted on July 18 after an international investigative consortium reported that the phones of Indian ministers, politicians, activists, businessmen and journalists were among the 50,000 that were potentially targeted by Pegasus, Israeli company NSO Group’s phone hacking software. According to this consortium, Pegasus can switch on a target’s phone camera and microphone, as well as access data on the device, effectively turning a phone into a pocket spy.In the first hearing of the batch of petitions on August 5, the top court said the allegations were serious in nature if the reports were correct and called for a law officer of the government even as it posed three questions to the petitioners.The first was why they came to the court after a gap of almost two years since the first reports on the use of Pegasus spyware were out back in May 2019. This was a reference to WhatsApp revealing then that NSO’s software was used to send malware to more than 1,400 phones.The second question was on whether any of the petitioners lodged a first information report or a criminal complaint against alleged illegal interception of their phones. The third related to the existence of any empirical evidence to corroborate the claims of the infractions.On August 10, Mehta, representing the Centre, was given time to get instructions on the matter from the government. During that hearing, the court also took exception to a “parallel debate” by petitioners outside the courts on the alleged surveillance of Indian citizens with the Pegasus spyware, saying if they are using the legal system, they must have faith in it. The court asked the petitioners to refrain from debating the issue on public platforms while it was adjudicating the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ready-to-form-probe-panel-on-pegasus-to-dispel-narrative-govt-101629142359717.html

The two BRO officers- -Junior Engineer Rahul Yadav and Subedar Sandesh Pawar- started the initiative about 20 days ago while being deployed in BRO’s Shivalik road project near the Indo-China border. Both are attached to BRO’s 72 Road Construction Company (RCC) working in the area. Speaking on the commendable initiative over the phone from Uttarkashi, Yadav said, “The sole aim of the initiative is to keep the children engaged after their parents go to work in the morning at 8 am.” “While working for the project, I observed that after the labourers leave for the worksite, their children often used to run behind army vehicles or play on the roads amid running traffic. This was greatly endangering their safety and inviting an unfortunate incident. To stop this, initially, we asked one of the female labourers to look after them but she failed. It was then that we decided to start a makeshift school to keep them engaged,” Yadav said. He said that he was soon joined by Subedar Pawar in the project. “We then started three makeshift schools in areas near the international border namely at Jangla, Hondoligarh and Neelapani at an altitude of about 10,000-12,000 ft. The schools are running under tents and boulders are used as seats for the children,” said Yadav. He informed that as the children were “cut off from the mainstream society”, they had to be taught from scratch. “We are teaching them the alphabets of Hindi and English apart from helping them identify various animals, fruits and vegetables. We have also taught them the national anthem and important dates of national importance. Apart from the two of us, we have also involved a few labourers in the initiative who are a little literate to teach the children in our absence,” said Yadav. His colleague Pawar said, “Since the initiative started, there are a total ofabout 75 children studying in these schools.” “The classes start from 8 am and continue till 12 noon. Then there is a two hour recess period followed by resumption of classes from 2 pm- 4 pm. Now, all those children playing on roads are engaged in studies with full dedication. It feels nice that we are able to get them to do something productive,” said Pawar adding, “We have provided them basic stationery like notebooks and pencils.” Their Commanding Officer, Major Binu VS too praised their effort and said, “What they are doing is really praiseworthy because it is providing education to these needy children. The BRO is trying to provide all the necessary items in these makeshift schools so that the children can learn effectively.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bro-officers-serving-near-indo-china-border-build-makeshift-schools-for-kids-of-migrants-101629146189054.html

The court held that since the right of single mothers to conceive through ATR and other procedure is recognised the column regarding the father’s details in birth certificates violates the right to privacy, liberty and dignity of mothers. It directed the government to create separate forms for such mothers at the earliest. The direction came on the plea of a divorced woman, who later conceived through In Vitro Fertilisation procedure. While filling the form for birth certificates, father’s details are must under the Kerala Registration of Birth and Deaths Act (1970). The petitioner contended that she received the sperm from a sperm bank and even she has no idea about the contributor and repeated requests to fill the form in full (with father’s details) intrudes upon her privacy and liberty. She also said the certificate leaving the father’s details as blank will lead to further questions in future and it will affect her privacy and dignity. Later the court agreed to her contention. “It falls within realm of the right of privacy. There is no rhyme or reason to insist to provide the name of the father in the form prescribed for registration of birth and death. Leaving the father’s column blank will later affect the mother and child’s dignity,” the court said directing the government to prepare separate forms for such mothers. “By the passage of time evolution of new technique, change in lifestyle and personal choices recognised by the rule of law need appropriate modifications/changes and additions,” the court observed.

The court held that since the right of single mothers to conceive through ART and other procedure is recognised, the column regarding the father’s details in birth certificates violates the right to privacy, liberty and dignity of mothers.

She also said a certificate that would leave the father’s details blank would raise questions in the future, affecting her dignity. The court accepted her argument. “It falls within the realm of the right to privacy.

Leaving the father’s column blank will later affect the mother and child’s dignity,” the court said, directing the government to prepare separate forms for such mothers. The court added that the rule of law also needs appropriate modifications or changes given the fact that with time, new techniques have evolved and lifestyle and personal choices have changed.

17-08-2021||India||Police action on Bidar school students in violation of juvenile justice Act: Karnataka HC||BengaluruThe Karnataka high court on Monday observed that the police action against students of Shaheen School in Bidar, which included interrogation by weapon-carrying and uniformed law enforcement authorities, amounted to a violation of the Juvenile Justice Act.Basava Prasad Kunale, the advocate on record of the petitioners, told HT on Monday that the interrogation of the school students by uniformed policemen was challenged as only a special officer can do this when any child is in conflict with the law.“The reason (for HC to call it a violation of juvenile justice act) is that the investigating officer himself admits in his affidavit that they went to the school with police uniforms. So since they are admitting it, it is clearly in violation of the Juvenile justice act. It says that the interrogation has to be by the special officer,” Kunale said.A division bench of Chief Justice Abhay Oka and Justice NS Sanjay Gowda on Monday asked concerned higher officials to submit an affidavit on what action they will take against the police officials who interrogated these children.“It (HC) has also directed the state government to come up with guidelines so that those guidelines in the future will be a law for the police, whenever they are interrogating children,” according to the advocates on record for the petitioners.The students of the 4th, 5th and 6th grade of Shaheen School were subjected to interrogation after a local Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) activist, Neelesh Rakshyal, on 26 January 2020 filed a case against the school authorities over organising a play ‘Hum Kaghaz Nahin Dikhayenge’ (We will not show our document), a popular poem penned by comedian Varun Grover, that allegedly portrayed Prime Minister Narendra Modi in poor light, on January 21.One parent’s decision to stream the play on a social media platform exposed the school to intense scrutiny in the border district, about 676 kms from Bengaluru. Rakshyal had alleged that the head of the school had performed anti-national activities by spreading negative opinion about the Parliament’s laws among the students, spreading communal tension and inciting the public to oppose the legislation.The charges of sedition against the school authorities, arrest of two people (a parent and teacher) and the interrogation of students no older than 12 sitting scared on the floor when police questioned them, made national headlines last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-action-on-bidar-school-students-in-violation-of-juvenile-justice-act-karnataka-hc-101629144027421.html
17-08-2021||India||Senior JD(U) leaders skip RCP Singh’s event, Nitish Kumar says all well in party||The factionalism within the ruling JD-U in the state has finally come to the fore with senior party leaders including party national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh and party parliamentary board president Upendra Kushwaha maintaining distance from the programme organized to felicitate former party president and Union minister RCP Singh. Despite the denial by all top leaders, including chief minister Nitish Kumar, the chasm between supporters of Lalan Singh and RCP Singh is increasing. One example of this was the posters put up in Patna to welcome the Union minister. The posters initially didn’t have the photographs of Lalan Singh or Kushwaha, which raised a hue and cry in party circles. The pictures were restored after that. Kushwaha feigned ignorance about any such felicitation programme and said, “I have not been invited.” “’I have not received information about this nor has any letter come, so how can I join. I have to go to Jehanabad for an event. I came to know about his visit through the media,” Kushwaha said. Kushwaha, who joined JD(U) in March this year, however, was quick to add that there was no factionalism in the party. “There is no factionalism in the party. Those who are indulging in such things will fall in their places,” he said. “The disappearance of national president Lalan Singh’s picture from the banner poster made to welcome RCP Singh is intolerable. Lalan Singh is the national president of the party and his role should be understood by everyone,” said Kushwaha. Nitish Kumar on Monday laughed off the talks of factionalism. “If someone becomes the national president, he is welcomed. If someone becomes a Union minister, he is being welcomed. There is no factionalism, no difference in the party,” said Kumar after his Janata Darbar on Monday. Kumar went on to say that it was he who made RCP Singh the national president of the party. “When he became a minister at the Centre, he wanted to pass on the baton to Lalan Babu. So don’t be under any kind of confusion,” said Kumar. With rumours of factionalism in the party surfacing, Union minister RCP Singh said in Patna that he has a very cordial relation with Lalan Singh. “There is only one leader Nitish Kumar in the party while others work under him,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/senior-jd-u-leaders-skip-rcp-singh-s-event-nitish-kumar-says-all-well-in-party-101629143669338.html

If he said India should be tolerant then he behaved in a tolerant way. He said India should be a secular country and he behaved in a most secular manner. He had Gita, Bible, Quran and Guru Granth Sahib as his guide,” he said while unveiling the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Mananthawady. Later he had sadya (rice on plantain leaf with many traditional curries) with tribal students from the district who had cracked the common law admission test. The district was in the news in the first week of August after 9 students cleared the CLAT, seven of them from the Kattunayakkan community, most backward and vulnerable among the district population. “Today we have many people who say the country should be fair and they treat others unfairly. They say they want a secular nation but they themselves view religions differently. For me the statue is much more about the practice than it is about the personality,” he said without taking any names. On his three-day visit (August 16-18), he will be attending many programmes including the inauguration of two drinking water projects. Wayanad turned the first district in the country to vaccinate nearly 100 per cent of the eligible population. Young collector Adeela Abdulla, also a doctor, and a team of committed health officials were lauded by many. Gandhi also called on the collector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-swipe-at-present-day-leaders-rahul-gandhi-says-they-should-learn-from-mahatma-s-actions-101629142467827.html
17-08-2021||India||Parents from Odisha arrested for killing 2 newborns in Goa: Police||Bhubaneswar: Arrest of a 36-year-old man by the Odisha police in a different case led to a shocking revelation of murder of two newborns in Goa, where the accused and two women, all three migrant construction workers, stayed since the nationwide lockdown in March last year until last month, police said on Monday. According to the Odisha police, the three accused, during their stay in Goa, got into a relationship following which the two women gave birth to two children, who were murdered and buried by the trio. Police officials in Kalahandi district on Monday said they arrested the three accused and identified them as 36-year-old Tripal Naik, the two women 30-year-old Gurubari Majhi and 21-year-old Gayatri Nag, all from the same district, on charges of murder of the two newborn babies. “The three took part in the murder and burial of the two newborn male children in Goa. They buried the bodies to hide the heinous crime. Their confessions, post-mortem of the skeletal remains of the newborns by a forensic expert at Goa Medical College and Hospital and DNA fingerprinting cracked the case,” said sub-divisional police officer of Dharmagarh, Dhiraj Kumar Chopdar. Police said the main accused Naik had gone to Goa with Nag and Majhi to work as labours at a construction site before the nationwide lockdown was imposed in March 2020. While several other labourers from Odisha returned home, the trio stayed back at Saper in Goa. “During their stay, Tripal developed physical relationship with Majhi, a widow, and Nag, an unmarried woman, claiming to be unmarried and proposing to keep both of them as his wives. In June this year, Majhi gave birth to a boy. As the baby was not born out of wedlock, she did not go to the hospital and delivered at their home in Goa. As Naik was not ready to raise the child, both of them strangulated the newborn to death and buried the body behind his house. Nag also helped both in disposing of the body,” said Chopdar. After a month, Nag too gave birth to a baby boy. “Gayatri and Tripal then killed the one-day-old baby. After killing her baby, Gayatri covered the body and gave it to Tripal who then buried the body behind his house,” said an official. After few days Naik told the two women that he was already married and suggested both of them to go their own way. On July 4, all of them returned home in Odisha, police said. The murder of the two newborns would have remained a secret if Naik on July 26 would not have come to Borguma village and abducted Nag with assurance of marriage, police said. However, family members of Nag brought her back along with Naik from Brahamaniguda jungle of Kesinga and reported the matter to Golamunda police station. During the interrogation of Naik, police came to know about the murder of the two newborns and subsequently arrested Gayatri and Gurubari. Police exhumed the skeletal remains of the newborns from Saper in Goa on August 5 in the presence of an executive magistrate and also seized the pickaxe used by the accused for digging pit. Postmortem of the skeletan remains by assistant professor at Goa Medical College, Dr Panag S Kumar, proved that the newborns were children of the two women, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parents-from-odisha-arrested-for-killing-2-newborns-in-goa-police-101629140850127.html
17-08-2021||India||Maoism affected districts down to 70 for the first time: MHA||New Delhi The number of districts affected by left-wing extremism (LWE) has declined sharply to 70 in 10 states for the first time in over three decades, with Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand showing the biggest improvement, according to a map of the Maoist insurgency redrawn by the ministry of home affairs. Of these, only 25 districts in eight states are now categorised as “most affected”. Uttar Pradesh is now free of Maoism, according to the home ministry’s revised list, accessed by HT. Until two months back, about 90 districts in 11 states were affected by LWE which received central assistance under the Security Related Expenditure (SRE) while 30 districts in seven states were categorised as “most affected”.“Overall, the incidents of LWE violence have reduced by 70% from an all-time high of 2,258 in 2009 to 665 in 2020. Similarly, the deaths of security forces and civilians have come down by 80% from all time high of 1,005 in 2010 to 183 in 2020,” said an officer, requesting anonymity. The home ministry, upon considering the improved security situation, reduced violence and development work, decided to revise the list from July 1. According to the list, only 70 districts in 10 states are affected and are covered under the SRE scheme. Under SRE, districts affected by left wing extremism get assistance from the Centre for the purpose of reimbursement of security-related expenditure such as transportation, communication, hiring of vehicles, stipend to surrendered Maoists, construction of infrastructure for the forces, etc. People familiar with the development said the shrinkage of geographical spread of LWE influence is evident in reduced violence in the last six years (from 2015 to 2020), with 47% fewer incidents compared with the preceding 6 years (from 2009 to 2014). Subsequently, security forces have opened multiple camps inside the jungles which used to be the stronghold of the Maoists, due to which insurgents are not able to carry out frequent attacks, over 2,300 mobile towers have been installed, close to 5,000km of roads have been constructed, and other infrastructure work is being carried out. Former director general of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) K Durga Prasad said: “The recruitment of Maoists have come down, their leadership is old, and the party ideology is missing among the young cadres due to which the pockets of their activities have been restricted enormously over the years. There is also better intelligence sharing between agencies, disruption of logistics chains like weapons, money and food items and they are not able to recruit cadres from any state other than Chhattisgarh.” According to the revised list, Bihar, where the Maoists once enjoyed widespread support among the poor, has shed the highest (six) number of districts in the latest list, with only 10 districts now affected by LWE as compared to 16 till June this year. Arwal, East Champaran, Jehanabad, Muzzafarpur, Nalanda and Vaishali are no longer affected by Maoism. In Odisha, where the state government has a formidable anti-naxal force, the Special Operations Group (SOG), districts affected by Maoism have come down from 15 to 10. Similarly, Jharkhand has shown significant improvement with only 16 districts now affected by LWE against 19 till June. Koderma, Ramgarh and Simdega have been removed from the list. The most affected districts in the state have also come down from 13 to only 8. Chhattisgarh, where the worst violence has been reported over the years, continues to have 14 affected districts. There is no change in the LWE situation in Kerala and West Bengal, where three districts and one district, respectively, are affected by LWE; while Madhya Pradesh now has three affected districts as compared to two earlier. Uttar Pradesh, which had three Maoist-affected districts – Chandauli, Mirzapur and Sonbhadra – is now free of any kind of LWE-related incidents. The government has, for the first time, classified eight districts as “districts of concern” on the basis of inputs from intelligence and security agencies that Maoists are making serious inroads there. These are – Wayanad in Kerala, Kabirdham, Kondagaon and Mungeli in Chhattisgarh, Mandla in Madhya Pradesh, Koraput in Odisha, Garhwa in Jharkhand and Aurangabad in Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoism-affected-districts-down-to-70-for-the-first-time-mha-101629140788162.html
17-08-2021||India||SC asks petitioner to approach Centre for treatment expenses under Rare Diseases policy||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday directed a woman seeking financial assistance for her husband’s lung transplant to approach the Centre under the National Policy for Rare Diseases 2021 after coming across a news report that talked about a huge sum of over ₹62 crore getting added to the fund under the new policy. This money was reportedly collected as part of a crowd-funding exercise to save a Kerala toddler, suffering from a rare condition, who died recently.The news report that appeared on Monday in leading newspapers caught the attention of the court, which was dealing with the issue of a 31-year-old woman Sheela Mehra hailing from Madhya Pradesh. She approached the court seeking a sum of ₹1 crore to treat her husband, who required a daily expense of ₹1.5 lakh to sustain on an artificial lung-support machine called ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) at Secunderabad-based Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences Limited (KIMS). There was a huge outstanding amount of ₹14 lakh to be paid to the hospital and the woman had already spent close to ₹1 crore on her husband’s treatment.The bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai said, “You (petitioner) can apply under the policy (National Policy for Rare Diseases). We have read it in the newspapers that one boy was in need of finances after a petition for him was being considered by the Kerala High Court. Around ₹62 crore was collected but the boy died. This money is now to be transferred to this fund under the National Policy (for Rare Diseases). We can allow you to file representation. Let the Government consider.”The bench was referring to a report with regard to a toddler in Kerala who suffered a rare disease called spinal muscular atrophy for which he frequently required an expensive injection of ₹18 crore. The news led to people contributing generously for the cause. After nearly ₹64 crore was collected, the boy died. Later, a petition was filed by a 41-year old woman, who suffered a rare illness, seeking part of the money collected for the toddler, which was to become part of the fund under the National Policy for Rare Diseases. It was this news that was reported in newspapers on Monday.The petitioner’s lawyer Mukesh Kumar informed the court that already a representation has been moved before the Centre and the MP government based on which the petitioner was allocated ₹3 lakh under the PM CARES fund and ₹2 lakh from the Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Relief Fund. However, the petitioner still needed ₹55 lakh for conducting a lung transplant for her husband Manish Kumar Gohiya whose lungs suffered 100% damage after contracting Covid-19 in May this year.The bench directed a fresh representation to be moved under the 2021 policy to the Centre, PM CARES fund, PM Relief Fund, Madhya Pradesh government and MP Chief Minister Relief Fund. The court directed the concerned authorities to deal with the representation by passing necessary orders.The petitioner also sought an order from court for immediate release of ₹3 lakh from PM CARES as the disbursal was expected to take about three months. The bench remarked, “We will not pass such an order. It is not that the Government has so much of money that they can distribute to all. We know the condition of several other people suffering in this country.”In order to help the petitioner, the court had last week asked the hospital KIMS to be generous and specify if some amount could be waived off.On Monday, advocate M Shrinivas Rao, appearing for KIMS, told the court that the hospital had agreed to provide a 15% waiver on the total outstanding amount. The bench observed, “You are running such a big hospital. What will this 15% be? Anyway, we will not hold anything against you. We will allow the petitioner to file a representation to you (hospital).”“There is a possibility that the petitioner’s husband could be wheeled out of ECMO. Doctors will be taking a call on it tomorrow since the patient’s condition is improving,” the hospital informed the court. When the bench wished to know if the patient does not require lung transplant, the counsel for KIMS said, “In this sort of condition, we do not know whether a person’s condition improves or deteriorates.”After being diagnosed with Covid-19 during the second wave of the pandemic, Gohiya was admitted at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhopal on May 14. He was later shifted in an air ambulance on June 2 to Hyderabad-based Yashoda Hospital where a CT scan revealed that his lungs had suffered 100% damage. He required ECMO machine to survive and the only hospital having this machine was KIMS Hospital. He was shifted to KIMS on July 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-asks-petitioner-to-approach-centre-for-treatment-expenses-under-rare-diseases-policy-101629140489916.html
17-08-2021||India||Bengaluru lakes degrading due to neglect: VP Naidu||Bengaluru Vice President Venkaiah Naidu on Monday mirrored the sentiments of concerned Bengalureans when he pointed out that the water bodies in India’s IT capital were degrading due to neglect and encroachments.“Bangalore (Bengaluru) is blessed with so many lakes and water bodies. Slowly they are getting degenerated because of people’s carelessness and also encroachments at various levels,” Naidu said, breaking away from his speech to make the observations while addressing scientists and students at the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR) at Bengaluru on Monday. Earlier in the day, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai received the vice president while governor Thaawarchand Gehlot accompanied Naidu to the event.Naidu’s comments comes at a time when lakes continue to disappear in Bengaluru on account of rapid and unplanned growth, encroachments and poor maintenance of these water bodies by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP).Bengaluru, once known as the land of a thousand lakes, now has barely 200 of them which are in pitiable conditions.Though the BBMP and the state government earmark hundreds of crores towards rejuvenation of lakes each year, experts state that this is mostly to beautify the surroundings of the lake than the ecology which is far more important than the aesthetics of such water bodies.Even the Vrishabhavathi river, once a source of water for Bengaluru, has now become nothing more than a flowing drain with toxic water on account of unplanned civic infrastructure which allows sewage water directly into lakes and other water bodies, contaminating soil, underground water and impacting the overall quality of life in a city which is known world over for its prowess in information technology, startups and aerospace among other sectors. At least 19 lakes out of the remaining 205 (out of earlier estimates of at least 250) under the BBMP have been termed as disused lakes due to encroachments according to a February 2021 report by CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI).Some of these encroachments are by big builders who then name these projects “lake view” to attract more interest from potential buyers, Hindustan times had reported on March 21.Bengaluru, experts say, is a victim of its own success as it continues to encroach upon lake beds to build apartments and other commercial spaces which has impacted the ecology, making it prone to flooding and an acute drinking water crisis which has forced successive state governments to deprive several districts of Cauvery river water, about a 100 kms away, and pump it into Bengaluru to quench its thirst.The vice president also said that Karnataka chief minister should focus his attention on the “maintenance and rejuvenation” of water bodies in and around Bengaluru and the rest of the state.Naidu also asked the scientific community to come up with out-of-the-box solutions to address challenges faced by mankind like climate change, promote research in emerging areas like computational biology and artificial intelligence and focus on agriculture among others.He also said that agriculture is the “basic culture of the country” and asked the scientific community to focus their attention on issues faced by the farming community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-lakes-degrading-due-to-neglect-vp-naidu-101629140192911.html
17-08-2021||India||New K’taka Cabinet may help Cong revive AHINDA: Experts||The BJP’s decision to follow a dominant-caste strategy, reflected in the replacement of BS Yediyurappa with Basavaraj Bommai – both Lingayats – as the Karnataka chief minister last month, has made it more conducive for opposition parties and leaders to cash in on efforts at mobilising the extremely backward communities in the state, people aware of the developments said.Former chief minister and Congress’s leader of the opposition Siddaramaiah, who came to power riding on his AHINDA strategy in the 2013 state assembly elections, is most likely to benefit from the regrouping of backward classes, the people said.AHINDA is the Kannada acronym for minorities, backward classes, and Dalits.Experts say the environment is conducive to mobilise the support of smaller and marginalised groups, which due to their numbers have the potential to become deciding factors in close election contests.The efforts for mobilisation include taking the legal route to bring pressure on the Bommai government to release the findings of the Social and Educational Survey-2015, better known as the caste census, which was conducted by the Siddaramaiah-led state government in 2015.“A forum of extremely backward classes has started tours across all districts in Karnataka. They have already done it in Kolar and Tumakuru to pile pressure on the government to release the caste census report. They have also gone to court over the matter,” one person aware of the developments said, requesting not to be named. The newly formed Athi Hindulida Jagruti Vedike (Extreme Backward Classes Awareness Forum in Kannada) had approached Siddaramaiah and the Congress, seeking help for making the caste-census report public.Hundreds of small and marginalised groups in Karnataka are denied political, educational and employment benefits as they are largely unorganised and scattered across the state, leaving them at a disadvantage for availing of government-supported benefits or reservations.Mukya Mantri Chandru, the honorary president of the forum, earlier told Hindustan Times that reservation was being given across the country based on unscientific data and that those with no representation in employment, education or politics are often left out.The initiative for mobilisation of backward classes also puts Siddaramaiah on a collision course with his own partymen, especially those like party president DK Shivakumar, who are from dominant communities like Vokkaligas. The forum has also approached Shivakumar for his support.With the Lok Sabha already passing a bill to give back powers on forming OBC lists to the state, Karnataka, which has seen several communities seeking higher share of reservation, is now trying to make the most for lifting of the upper ceiling, which is 50% according to a Supreme Court ruling.But unlike the Lingayats, believed to be the single-largest caste group in the state, backward classes are not consolidated and do not vote en masse.“How do you categorise people and communities unless you get the data. There are different categories of backward classes that include more backward, most backward, microscopic and invisible,” said one person aware of the developments, requesting not to be named.At least 36 caste groups in Karnataka await their turn for a change in reservation status and category as well as corrections in spellings, among other requests, before the Karnataka Backward Classes Commission, people aware of the developments said.But the limelight has been on the dominant caste groups, especially the Lingayats and Vokkaligas, that have been challenged by smaller and more unorganised groups for similar benefits.Yediyurappa had doled out sops in caste-specific programmes as part of the BJP’s outreach to get the backing of communities which are traditionally not known to support the party.The recent reservation-related demands by Panchamasali, Kurubas, Vokkaligas and Valmikis, among others, have added to apprehensions of smaller communities with scattered populations across the state.Siddaramaiah’s attempt to accord the Lingayats with the a separate religion status and make demarcations on Veerashaivas (a term used interchangeably in many parts but also believed to be the Hinduised version of the community) cost the Congress power in 2018, forcing the party to ally with its rival, Janata Dal (Secular), to keep the BJP at bay.Siddaramaiah has a difficult task to get the backing of such groups over members of his own partymen, BJP and JD(S) who are also trying to reach out to these communities.HD Kumaraswamy, the former chief minister and JD(S) leader, said on Monday that Siddaramaiah claims to be the saviour of backward classes but the reality is different.“During Siddaramaiah’s term, homes that were supposed to be given to Dalits were cancelled and given to other communities. I have the information. He is not the only one who is protecting backward communities,” Kumaraswamy said. “In their (backward classes) name, the atrocities committed are many and I have all the details of this. He is not the only one who can save AHINDA. There are many people who have worked hard to protect this group.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-k-taka-cabinet-may-help-cong-revive-ahinda-experts-101629140191537.html
17-08-2021||India||BJP leadership will decide on my future role: Vijayendra||Vice president of the Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and son of former chief minister BS Yediyurappa, BY Vijayendra, on Monday said that the national leadership would decide his future role in the state.“There is no question of me aspiring to become a minister or the state president. Ours is a national party, not a regional party, so there are state and central leaders to decide on what position or responsibility should be given at what time,” Vijayendra said in Shivamogga, the home district of the former chief minister.Vijayendra was accused of running a parallel administration under the aegis of Yediyurappa, the then CM, that led to simmering dissent within the BJP unit of the state, which openly called out the father-son duo for corruption.It was speculated that Vijayendra would enter the Basvaraj Bommai cabinet after his father agreed to step down, indicating towards the possibility that Yediyurappa and the BJP national leadership had arrived at some understanding to placate the former.“In the past, Yediyurappa when he struggled for the party by organising marches and rallies, he never did that with an idea to come to power, to become a minister or a chief minister. In the same way, Raganna (brother and Shivamogga MP B Y Raghavendra) and I....I’m working within the party framework as the vice- president,” Vijayendra said.Vijayendra has also been put in-charge of three bypolls so far in the state, of which he managed to secure victory in two, including the BJP’s first ever victory in Mandya district, about 99 kms from Bengaluru in 2019.The BJP is looking to make further inroads into the old Mysuru region where it has little or no presence in terms of political representation, to help it come back to power in 2023 on its own.Yediyurappa and Vijayendra have both stated that they will go on state-wide tours as part of efforts to build the party. With the upcoming Grama and Taluka Panchayati elections, the BJP hopes to increase its presence in grass roots that would later help them in the 2023 assembly elections.“It is the dream of both Yediyurappa and JP Nadda. And to realise that dream, the old Mysuru region should be given importance and I will involve myself more in the region,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leadership-will-decide-on-my-future-role-vijayendra-101629140189368.html
17-08-2021||India||2 held in MP for creating fake voter ID cards||With the arrest of two youths, the Madhya Pradesh police are looking at a possible cyber fraud gang allegedly involved in duping people by getting access to their bank accounts by changing their personal details on Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), or Aadhaar, website, a police officer said. There have been instances of fake Aadhaar cards being created by photo-shopping original Aadhaar letter, but this could probably be one of the few cases where a person’s original details on UIDAI website was changed to get control of their Aadhaar details and linked bank account, the police officer added. The MP police on Friday arrested two people from Morena, who were reportedly working for one Hariom Sakhwar, the prime suspect in the case of illegal access to the Election Commission of India (ECI) website for creating fake voter identity cards. Shakhwar, 18, a resident of Ambah town of Morena, is absconding, police said. A police officer, who is investigating the case, said Sakhwar used to send some link to the two arrested accused -- identified as Akash Jain and Ajay Singh Kushwaha, both 19 years old and unemployed -- for making changes in Aadhaar details by changing the mobile numbers, police said. “They used to create a fake identity document of a person using their biometric details on the UIDAI website through that link within a few minutes,” the officer said. He added that for each change, they would get ₹300 to 400 and most of the times the new identity would be used for a cyber crime. Morena superintendent of police Lalit Shakyawar said, “Jain and Kushwaha used to get ₹300-400 for creating fake IDs. We are investigating the case separately and more revelation will be done after the arrest of Hariom Sakhwar as we are yet to know about the link which he used to send to them for creating fake IDs.” The officer cited earlier said they cannot confirm yet whether the UIDAI system was hacked or the accused used to some other mechanism to make changes in the details of a person. “There are many unanswered questions from their interrogation,” he said. The two accused, who operated a small cyber shop, smashed their computers before their arrest, police said. “We are trying to retrieve data from their systems,” the officer said. Elaborating the modus operandi, police said the two accused would swap mobile phone SIM cards to withdraw money from bank accounts of people. Through SIM swap, the fraudsters would obtain duplicate SIM card and get the original card blocked for some time. In the period when the original SIM is blocked, the accused would use the fake one to withdraw money from the person’s bank account gaining access of the one-time passwords (OTPs). The Uttar Pradesh police on Thursday busted a gang involved in creating fake voter identity cards by accessing the Election Commission’s website by using password of a contractual employee of the commission in Saharanpur. As one of the accused was from MP, the state police started separate investigation into the case. Shakhwar, a school dropout, used to run a cyber café, where he came in contact with another accused Vipul Saini and mastermind Arman Malik. They together created about 10,000 fake IDs, police said. MP Police on Friday detained four friends of Shakhwar and released two of them, who were also teenagers. The other two, Akash and Ajay, have been arrested under Section 420 (fraud) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of IT Act, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-held-in-mp-for-creating-fake-voter-id-cards-101629140190046.html
17-08-2021||India||City starts door-to-door survey to tackle Covid||The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body) on Monday rolled out its ambitious initiative to send door-to-door a team of health officials in India’s IT capital to monitor general health of residents, collect information and spread awareness on Covid-19 pandemic. The move comes at a time when Bengaluru and the rest of Karnataka are staring at another wave of Covid-19 infections, which appears to be increasing with each passing day. The scheme – “Palike Vaidyaru Nimma Mane Bagilige”(Palike doctors at your doorstep) – will have one doctor and one paramedical staff to collect information on Covid-19 symptoms and comorbidities by going door-to-door as well as provide advice to residents on health care. “In the first phase, two wards each from assembly constituencies, 54 in total, have been chosen and the survey will start on 16 August 2021,” the BBMP said in a statement on Monday. The questions in the survey will include details of residents and family members, health and vaccination details among other information, which will be entered into the BBMP software each day. R Ashok, Karnataka’s revenue minister and in-charge of Bengaluru’s Covid-19 situation, on Monday said the new programme is part of an initiative to ensure safety of the city’s residents. “The first (intent of the new initiative) is to ensure health for Bangaloreans. If anyone tests positive when our team reaches them, then arrangements will be made to move them to hospitals,” Ashok said. He added that health officials will collect information on vaccination coverage and details of comorbidities--diagnosed and undiagnosed--and provide residents more targeted health care requirements. Ashok said the team will reach 50 homes each day with a set of questions. He added that this will build confidence among the residents and reduce any instance of panic. Bengaluru has seen the Covid-19 infections swing to extremes and was overwhelmed in the past two waves as the number of people requiring hospitals far exceeded the number of beds. The second wave, from around March this year, led to one of the worst crises the city and state has seen, when hospitals ran out of beds, oxygen, life-saving medicines and even space to cremate the dead as casualties increased. Karnataka and Bengaluru reported 1,065 and 270 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, respectively. A total of 28 deaths due to the infections were reported from the state on Monday, taking the toll to 37,007, according to the state health department’s daily bulletin. The former chief minister BS Yediyurappa-led government was criticised for its mishandling of the Covid-19 crisis and prioritising election and politics, adding to the challenges that the state had to overcome since the beginning of the pandemic around March last year. The new government under chief minister Basavaraj Bommai has been trying to prioritise Covid-19 management but has faltered in putting an end to political events where hundreds and thousands of people gather to be part of mega events like distribution of ration kits and, ironically, raising awareness on the pandemic. The Bommai government has imposed strict rules like weekend curfew in districts bordering with Kerala and Maharashtra and a night curfew across the state including in Bengaluru. Gaurav Gupta, the chief commissioner of the BBMP, said the initiative was part of the preventive measures in the city. He said the administration has brought down the threshold of 10 Covid-19 patients to just three to declare it as a micro-containment zone. He said the BBMP was in touch with over 1,000 apartment complexes with over a million homes in total to ensure that there is enough monitoring of the Covid-19 situation. Bengaluru has 198 wards as on date and Ashok said all wards will be part of their drive within one month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/city-starts-door-to-door-survey-to-tackle-covid-101629140187652.html
17-08-2021||India||‘Democracy cannot be held to ransom, Oppn not playing its part’||Bhupender Yadav, the union minister for environment, forests and climate change, and labour and employment,  blamed the opposition for behaving in an autocratic manner and not letting Parliament function during the monsoon session. In an interview,  he said democracy cannot be held to ransom, but works with the agreement, consent and discussion.Edited excerpts: The opposition says the government made no efforts to break the deadlock in Parliament.The opposition did as they pleased. When they wanted a discussion on certain issues such as the OBC Bill they allowed that, when they wanted a division of votes during the passage of any bill, they allowed that, but when the issue did not suit them, or the government wanted to put forth any issue, they did not allow it. People should see this. Democracy cannot be held to ransom; it works on the principle of agreement, consent and discussion. The opposition did not play its part.The opposition also claims that they were not informed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would introduce his ministers on the floor of the house and that this was not listed in the day’s business.The opposition knows that the business is conducted as per the business of the advisory committee’s decision. After that, there is an informal outreach as well. On the OBC bill issue, they allowed the house to run, which means an informal outreach was made. Did they mention the informal outreach when the OBC Bill was taken up or when the division was sought? Ultimately the government could pass some bills but the lawmakers’ right to ask questions was snatched by the protests. They snatched the MPs’ rights to raise questions related to their constituencies, the right of the members to move private members bills. The private member’s bills do not have any government involvement these are selected through the consensus of the House. Then why did the opposition not allow Parliament to run on these issues also? This shows completely autocratic behaviour towards running the house.The opposition also accuses the government of autocratic behaviour. They say despite their demand to send certain bills to select committees for further scrutiny the government does not agree to do so.Even those bills that were sent for further scrutiny were not allowed to be taken up or discussed in Parliament. Ordinances are time-bound; they are taken up as per the urgency of the time, and the opposition has the right to seek amendments to these. There have been instances in the Rajya Sabha when despite having the numbers on its side the government has agreed to (make) good amendments sought by the opposition. When has the government said it will not agree to a good suggestion?What about the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Amendment Bill; even the friendly parties wanted further scrutiny?Bills are sent to select committees when the House takes a decision to do so. But the opposition does not want to follow the first step that is to have a discussion and then agrees or not to move a motion to send the bill to the select committee. Between 2014 and 2019 more bills have been referred to the committees than during the UPA time.Both inside and outside Parliament there is a demand for the caste-based census, even from the BJP’s allies. Will the government agree to the demand since it is expected to come up during upcoming assembly elections?The ministry that undertakes this work (of conducting census) takes feedback from experts. This is still in the discussion stages; no decision has been taken on the issue so far. Unlike some of the parties that have only misled people, we are committed to ensuring social equity and justice through our policies and to the social-economic inclusion of all communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/democracy-cannot-be-held-to-ransom-oppn-not-playing-its-part-101629140128909.html
17-08-2021||India||Meghalaya orders judicial probe into police encounter of militant||Meghalaya chief minister Conrad Sangma on Monday ordered a judicial probe into the police encounter of former Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC) general secretary, Cherish Starfield Thangkhiew, a day after protests by the latter’s supporters led to vandalism and arson, prompting authorities to enforce a curfew in the state capital.The chief minister also said that the government is yet to take any decision on a request by home minister Lahkmen Rymbui to relieve him from the portfolio “with immediate effect”. In his resignation letter on Sunday, Rymbui had expressed shock over the protests and proposed a judicial probe into the encounter.“We have decided to institute a judicial inquiry under the Commission of Inquiry Act to look into the events that took place on August 13,” Sangma told reporters soon after chairing a cabinet meeting on the law and order situation on Monday evening.On Rymbui’s resignation, he said: “I have received the letter from the home minister but I have not yet made a decision. I will be examining the matter and will make a decision at an appropriate time.”The government also decided to extend the curfew in Shillong by 24 hours, till 5 am on August 18. The curfew, which came into effect at 8 pm on Sunday, was initially slated to continue till 5 am on August 17. Internet services in Shillong will also remain suspended for 24 hours, the chief minister said.Data services in the districts of East Khasi Hills, West Khasi Hills, South West Khasi Hillis and Ri-Bhoi were already withdrawn for 48 hours on Sunday.Thangkhiew, who surrendered in 2018, was suspected to be the mastermind of a spate of IED attacks, police said. According to director general of police R Chandranathan, he was shot dead on August 13 after he allegedly attacked a police team with a knife when they tried to arrest him in connection with two IED blasts at Laitumkhrah on August 10 and Khliehriat police reserve on July 14, respectively.During his address to the media, Sangma also revealed that the cabinet has decided to set up a ‘Peace Committee’ headed by deputy chief minister Prestone Tynsong and comprising cabinet ministers H Dohling and R Tongkhar to restore law and order in the state. “This committee will also co-opt members from the civil society organizations, religious organizations, Synjuk Ki Rangbah Shnong and others,” he said.Besides this, the chief minister said he will head a sub-committee with Tynsong and home minister Lahkmen Rymbui to look into the situation.“This committee will look into the different aspects of law and order, future threats that there may be, and at the same time look at the overall strengthening and functioning of the police,” he added.Three companies of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and two companies of Border Security Force (BSF) have already arrived and the state government has sought an additional five companies of Central Armed Paramilitary Forces (CAPF) to assist the state in containing the law and order situation in Shillong, Sangma said.“We have spoken to the home secretary. I (also) had a detailed discussion with Union home minister Amit Shah yesterday twice. He assured us of full cooperation and support,” he said.On the effect of suspension of internet services on students amid online classes, the chief minister said: “We realise the inconvenience that is being caused to the students but the overall law and order situation is our priority. Though they will be having some concerns and some difficulties which are unavoidable at this time, the priority of the government will always be to maintain law and order.”Meanwhile, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma requested Sangma to ensure the safety of people stranded in the hill state due to the curfew clamped since Sunday.Retweeting an appeal for help on Twitter by a person who’s wife and son are stranded in Shillong, he said: “For your information and necessary action @SangmaConrad”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meghalaya-orders-judicial-probe-into-police-encounter-of-militant-101629140127787.html
17-08-2021||India||Congress accuses Centre of evading query on purchase of Pegasus||Opposition leaders accused the Union government on Monday of evading a simple question of whether it used the Pegasus spyware to snoop on Indian citizens after the Centre told the Supreme Court that it will set up a committee of experts to investigate the allegations.The government’s stand came following the week when it had to cut short a torrid monsoon session of Parliament, where opposition MPs were unrelenting in calling for deeper investigations and answers from the government. Gopal Aggarwal, national spokesperson of BJP said the government has already said that “lawful interception is its right” and “no one can deny it the power to combat terrorism and other crimes through surveillance.”“There are two things… government has the right of interception and it is a matter of internal security. Now, if there is an unauthorised interception, only the legal investigation can find it out. Congress is trying to make it a political issue than trying to investigate (it),” Agarwal said.Reacting to Agarwal, Congress national spokesperson Gaurav Vallabh said that the government was just beating around the bush and the magnitude of the problem was so big that it needed a high-level investigation and not just an FIR.“Our question has been same (from the beginning) … that whether government purchased Pegasus or not. Why is this question not being answered simply in yes or no?” he asked.Vallabh added that the defence ministry is saying that we had not purchased it in defence ministry but why does not PM say that this was not purchased for any ministry at all.“Also, why did the budget of national security council secretariat have an exponential increase under the research and development heading? What has the government of India done with that money?” Vallabh questioned.He added that if the government has used it, then there arises another question as to why did they use a terror combating weapon against democracy of the country.“But the government is dodging the question. They are trying to answer it in a way that if one asks them that did they heat up the water, they say no we boiled it. The issue needs a one-line answer that whether they purchased the spyware or not.”CPI (M) leader and Rajya Sabha MP Jhon Brittas who is also a petitioner in the court desisted from commenting over the issue. He said that there have been directions by the court to not speak over this sub-judice matter.TMC did not respond to calls from HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-accuses-centre-of-evading-query-on-purchase-of-pegasus-101629140007595.html
17-08-2021||India||Bengal’s new e-service to clear building plans, mutation, trade licence in 15 days||West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra and urban development minister Chandrima Bhattacharya on Monday launched an extensive e-governance programme under which building plans and applications for mutation of property and trade licence will be processed and cleared online in 15 days in all urban areas. Only the twin cities of Kolkata and Howrah, where these services are already being offered, will be out of the new system, Mitra said at a virtual press conference. “These two urban areas have some exclusive by-laws as well,” he added. Urban local bodies (ULB) of all categories will offer the three services. Applicants will be able to register their complaints online if there is delay or any irregularity. The government will send its feedback through text messages and e-mails. Fees for the services will also be calculated online. “Nobody has to visit government offices anymore,” said Mitra. “The service for building plans will benefit around 15 million people in 60 ULBs of which five are corporations and 55 are A, B and C category civic bodies. The service for mutation will benefit people in 123 ULBs while 20 million people will get trade licence in all ULBs. We will include the 39 ULBs of D and E category in the next three months,” said Mitra. “Transparency is a salient aspect of the service. I have talked to finance ministers from several states. None of them offer these services on such a large scale,” said Mitra In the single-window system, which has been given the catch line, ‘You click, we serve,’ applicants will have to provide only proof of identity and ownership of property. Earlier, they had to physically submit multiple documents, said state chief secretary H K Dwivedi. “An application will be deemed cleared if not processed in 15 days. Clearing building plans sometimes takes time since it involves physical verification of property. However, civic bodies will be liable to pay penalty under the West Bengal Right to Public Services Act if there is excessive delay,” said Bhattacharya. “Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has set an example in e-governance. Government offices, engineers and architects have undergone extensive training over the last few months. The fire services department, the power department, the National Monuments Authority and the Union civil aviation ministry, whose clearances are required for building plans, are integrated in the system. We have a toll-free helpline and an online helpdesk as well,” said Bhattacharya. “Earlier, people had to wait for months although, on paper, these jobs were supposed to be done in 30 days. We now have one centralized system for all civic bodies. The moment an entry is made, it will be checked automatically,” Dwivedi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengals-new-e-service-to-clear-building-plans-mutation-trade-licence-in-15-days-101629139947745.html
17-08-2021||India||Need new birth forms for single mothers: HC||The Kerala High Court on Monday directed the state government to prepare separate birth and death forms for children born to single unwed mothers through the assisted reproductive technology (ART) which did not carry details of the father. The court held that since the right of single mothers to conceive through ATR and other procedures is recognised the column regarding the father’s details in birth certificates violates the right to privacy, liberty and dignity of mothers. It directed the government to create separate forms for such mothers at the earliest. The direction came on the plea of a divorced woman, who later conceived through In Vitro Fertilisation procedure. While filling the form for birth certificates father’s details are must under the Kerala Registration of Birth and Deaths Act (1970). The petitioner contended that she received the sperm from a sperm bank and even she has no idea about the contributor and repeated requests to fill the form in full (with father’s details) intrudes upon her privacy and liberty. She also said the certificate leaving the father’s details blank will lead to further questions in future and it will affect her privacy and dignity. Later the court agreed to her contention. “It falls within the realm of the right of privacy. There is no rhyme or reason to insist the petitioner provide the name of the father in the form prescribed for registration of birth and death. Leaving the father’s column blank will later affect the mother and child’s dignity,” the court said directing the government to prepare separate forms for such mothers. “By the passage of time evolution of new technique, change in lifestyle and personal choices recognised by the rule of law need appropriate modifications/changes and additions,” the court observed. Since the petitioner is in the 8th-month pregnancy the court directed the government to take immediate steps to create separate forms for mothers like her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-new-birth-forms-for-single-mothers-hc-101629139827541.html
17-08-2021||India||Current rulers should learn from Gandhi: Rahul||On a three-day visit to his constituency in Wayanad in north Kerala, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday said whatever Mahathma Gandhi said, he put it into action, and present-day rulers will have to take many lessons from his teachings and actions. “The powerful thing about Gandhi Ji was that whatever he said he put it into action. If he said India should be tolerant then he behaved in a tolerant way. He said India should be a secular country, and he behaved in a mostly secular manner. He had Gita, Bible, Quran and Guru Granth Sahib as his guide,” he said while unveiling the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Mananthawady. Later, he had a Sadya (rice on a plantain leaf with many traditional curries) with tribal students from the district, who cracked the common law admission test. The district was in the news in August first week after nine students cleared the CLAT, seven of them from the Kattunayakkan community, most backward and vulnerable among the district population. “Today, we have many people who say the country should be fair and they treat others unfairly. They say they want a secular nation, but they view religions differently. For me, the statue is much more about the practice than it is about the personality,” he said without taking any names. On his three-day visit (Aug 16-18), he will be attending many programmes, including the inauguration of two drinking water projects. Wayanad turned the first district in the country to vaccinate nearly 100 per cent of the eligible population -- young collector Adeela Abdulla, who is also a medical doctor and a team of committed health officials were lauded by many. Gandhi also called on the collector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/current-rulers-should-learn-from-gandhi-rahul-101629139771695.html
17-08-2021||India||Will fix irregularities before waivers: Stalin||Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Monday said that his government will implement schemes to waive farm loans and gold loans only after they rectify malpractices, which they have found running to the tune of several crore rupees in these schemes. “Though we intend to implement these schemes, there are several irregularities,” said Stalin. “Even when we made calculations for waving farmers’ loans, irregularities run up to several crores. This will be rolled out after the system is rectified.” It was a heated discussion between the DMK and opposition AIADMK during the first day of the debate in the Assembly on the revised budget that was presented last week by finance minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan. Former AIADMK minister R B Udhayakumar accused the DMK of tabling the white paper on the state’s finances ahead of the budget only to wriggle out of its election promises. Stalin assured that the three-month-old DMK government will not back on its election promises and went on a counter-attack blaming the AIADMK for not implementing several of its election promises, such as offering free mobile phones, wifi in public places, Amma mineral water and subsidised ration. “It’s a huge list. But concerning waiving farm loans and gold loans, the cooperation minister I Periyasamy would submit the irregularities in these schemes with evidence during his reply to the debate on the demand for grants in his department,” Stalin said. After the assembly session speaking to HT, Udhayakumar said that they didn’t get into the issue of farm and jewellery loans. “It’s the new government’s opinion (that there are irregularities) and let them do what they have to (by conducting an enquiry). We cannot stop them,” he said. “All we are saying is that they have to prioritise social security schemes the way we did even when the state’s finances were tight. The white paper has not brought out any new information. But they are using it as a reason to delay implementing the schemes. Did they say before elections that they will identify those eligible for the scheme and then implement? Why are they taking a difference stance now? And they haven’t said anything about the criteria for eligibility.”The previous AIADMK regime in February, close on the heels of the model code of conduct coming into effect, had announced a crop loan waiver taken by 1.643 million farmers from cooperative banks. “That government left us with the onerous legacy of meeting the cost of the scheme estimated at ₹12,110.74 crores,” Rajan had said while presenting the Revised Budget Estimates 2021-22 on August 13 and allocated a provision of ₹4,803.95 crores. The irregularities that Rajan listed were: a large number of loans were disbursed just before the announcement of the scheme, violations at the individual beneficiary level, including disbursal of loans without crop details as per the Adangal. At the cooperative society level, some societies have disbursed loans without obtaining sanctions or without the release of cash credit from the District Co-operative Credit Banks. “In some cases, societies retained loan collections and disbursed them again, which amounts to ever-greening of the portfolio,” he said. In the case of agricultural jewel loans to the DMK says that it was found that jewels were not valued properly and were short in weight or poor in quality. “Writing off such loans amounts to rewarding wrongdoers,” Rajan had said. He added that a preliminary assessment shows that it is a similar case regarding jewel loans and they want to enquire so that only the truly eligible beneficiaries are benefitted. Besides, the malpractices in the system, the revised budget had indicated that welfare schemes and subsidies will be provided only after identifying true beneficiaries by taking up a data collation exercise to understand the true economic status of all the households. The white paper had stated that the state will have to reorient to targeted subsidies so that it goes only to the poor for whom it was intended to control overspending. The subsidies, which accounted for 12.6% in 2006, have currently risen to 27% of the state’s total revenue expenditure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-fix-irregularities-before-waivers-stalin-101629139769836.html
17-08-2021||India||Mandaviya announces ₹267-cr aid for Kerala||Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Monday announced a special package of ₹267.35 crore for Kerala to strengthen its health infrastructure to fight the second wave of the Covid-19 outbreak. Having rushed to the state in the wake of high caseload, Mandaviya met Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and state health minister Veena George and officials in the state capital on Monday. “We will provide all possible help to the state. Besides this amount, ₹1 crore will be made available to each district to create a medicine pool. The Centre will also ensure creation of a centre of excellence that caters to telemedicine facilities in every district,” the minister tweeted after his marathon talks with the CM and others. He added the state will be given top priority in allocation of vaccine. In another tweet, the Union minister, said, “Under the visionary leadership of PM @NarendraModi ji, Central Government has assured all possible help to Kerala, including providing vaccines to the State.”“Had an intensive meeting with the CM and health minister and officials. The Centre is committed to help the state. For prioritising health of children, paediatric ICU will be established in each district hospitals with 10 kilo-litre liquid oxygen storage tank facility,” Mandaviya tweeted. Later a senior state health official, who did not wish to be named, said talks were fruitful and the central minister was studious and aware of problems being faced by the state. The state also raised its long-pending demand for an AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Science) in the state, the official added.Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the Union minister expressed satisfaction over the ongoing containment and mitigation measures of the state. “We told we need enough doses to inoculate maximum people in coming months. We sought 1.11 crore doses. The minister assured us the Centre will try its best to send enough vaccines,” the CM said in a Facebook post.For more than a month, the state has been reporting half of the total caseload of the country and its test positivity rate is four times higher than the national average. With only 3% of the nation’s population, the state has been contributing more than half of the total cases for the past few weeks and its case trajectory has baffled medical experts and others. Pointing out that the Union government rushed an experts’ team to the state in the first week of August and it visited eight districts during the week-long tour, minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan, who is from the state, said two days back that the Centre was really worried over the pandemic situation in the state. Meanwhile, the state reported 12,294 cases on Monday with a TPR of 14.03% after 87,578 samples were tested, according to the state health ministry. It also reported 142 deaths, taking the to 18,743 in the state. Malappuram remained top on the Covid-19 chart with 1,693 new cases. The active caseload in the state stood at 1,72, 239. In the last 24 hours, the country reported 32,937 cases with TPR less than 3%. The Kerala government is keeping a high vigil during the ongoing Onam festivities and many experts have warned another surge after the festival.

17-08-2021||India||BJP kicks off Jan Ashirwad Yatra with new ministers||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday launched Jan Ashirwad Yatras from different parts of the country, accusing the opposition of jeopardising democracy by stalling the recently concluded monsoon session of Parliament. Thirty nine ministers, who were inducted into the Union council of ministers on July 7, will be part of these yatras across 22 states.On Monday, close to a dozen central ministers participated in the yatras organised to introduce the newly inducted ministers to the people and tell them the party’s version of the washout of the monsoon session of Parliament. This was decided after Prime Minister Narendra Modi was not able to introduce his council of ministers in both houses of Parliament on account of the opposition’s protest, seeking a discussion on the Pegasus snooping controversy, the farmers’ agitation and price rise.At one such yatra undertaken by Union environment minister Bhupendra Yadav, the mainstay of his speech was the opposition’s alleged efforts to derail the session. “The Parliament is for discussion not dancing on the tables. The books kept there are for reading not ripping apart…” he said at a public meeting organised to felicitate him in Alwar, Rajasthan.Yadav, an OBC leader who before being inducted as minister was the party’s national general secretary, in charge of seven state elections, dubbed the disruptions as “disrespect” and said, “…A big change in India’s polity is about to come, it has begun with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The opposition did not allow him to introduce the ministers, this is an insult to the people. And when the time comes, the people of this country will give them (the opposition) a befitting reply.” The government had earlier alleged that the opposition, by not deferring to the tradition of introducing ministers in Parliament, showed disregard towards the representatives from the socially and educationally backward classes, women and other marginalised sections, who have been given a place at the high table.This was reinforced in Coimbatore on Monday by L Murugan, minister of state for information and broadcasting, when he accused the opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and Congress of not allowing him to be introduced in Parliament as he was a Dalit. “DMK has been in power for 20 years but did they make anyone from a poor and ordinary family a Union minister? No,” said Murugan, who was the former Tamil Nadu BJP president.Taking a dig at the DMK government in Tamil Nadu, Murugan said that through his induction and several others from backward communities as Union ministers PM Modi showed the spirit of social justice. “Modi ji is the true champion of social justice,” said the minister, who had earlier served as the national SC/ST commission’s vice-president. “I’m from a poor and ordinary family. Congress and DMK didn’t want a person like me, who is now a Union minister, to be introduced,” Murugan said while beginning his three-day tour. Union minister of state for education, Annapurna Devi, at her constituency Koderma, called the Narendra Modi goverment an inclusive government that gives representation to all sections of society. “The basic philosophy of the BJP is to work for Antyodaya, that is the last man standing. The Narendra Modi government works with the mantra of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas. I thank the PM for giving me an opportunity. In today’s cabinet, there are 11 women, 28 OBCs, 12 SCs and 8 belonging to the ST community,” she said. Annapurna Devi, the second MP from Jharkhand to join the Modi cabinet after tribal affairs minister Arjun Munda, is a former Rashtriya Janata Dal veteran. She was the Jharkhand president of the Lalu Prasad Yadav-led RJD when she switched sides and joined the BJP ahead of the 2019 general elections. Newly-inducted Union ministers Bharti Pawar (health and family welfare), Kapil Patil (MoS Panchayati Raj) and Bhagwat Karad (MoS finance) also took out their yatras in different parts of Maharashtra.In Gujarat, Union ministers Mahendra Munjapara and Devusinh Chauhan embarked on the yatra a day after Union minister Darshna Jardosh (MoS railways and textiles) started her tour from Karamsad town on Sunday. The vehicle rally of junior women and child development minister Mahendra Munjapara, an MP from Surendranagar, began from Ahmedabad, while Kheda MP and junior communications minister Devusinh Chauhan started his yatra from Palanpur in Banaskantha district.Health minister Mansukh Mandaviya and junior fisheries minister Parshottam Rupala will start their yatras from August 17. In Bihar, the yatra will start from August 19.Following the opposition’s unrelenting protest in both Houses of Parliament that saw proceedings affected, the government has accused the opposition of disrespecting parliamentary etiquette, wasting public money and flitting from issue to issue instead of taking up debates and discussion. A delegation of seven Union ministers on Sunday submitted a memorandum to the Rajya Sabha chairperson Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu to take stern action against what they alleged is “unprecedented, extreme and violent acts” in the Upper House in the final hours of the disruption-hit monsoon session on August 11. That day, there was ruckus in the House following which at least two marshals complained about being manhandled by some opposition lawmakers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjpkicks-off-jan-ashirwad-yatra-with-new-ministers-101629139647995.html
17-08-2021||India||Repatriation of Indians hit as chaos clouds Kabul airport||India on Monday pledged to stand by its partners in Afghanistan following the country’s takeover by the Taliban even as the repatriation of Indian officials and nationals was paused because of chaos at Kabul airport, where thousands of Afghans rushed in, some so desperate to escape the Taliban that they held onto a military jet as it took off, and plunged to their deaths.At least seven people were killed around the airport, with the circumstances not being entirely clear — some likely died in a stampede while gunshots too were heard.All flights at the airport — both military and civilian — were halted until Afghan civilians can be cleared from the runway, a Pentagon official told the Associated Press.Late on Monday, hundreds of people remained trapped between American forces trying to push them out of the airport and Taliban forces trying to keep them in, witnesses said.In India, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said the government was working to facilitate the repatriation of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus who wish to leave Afghanistan as well as some Indian nationals who are still in the war-torn country.“The security situation in Kabul has deteriorated significantly in the last few days. It is changing rapidly even as we speak,” Bagchi said in the first official reaction from the Indian side since the fall of President Ashraf Ghani’s government on Sunday.The sudden closure of Hamid Karzai International Airport threw schedules for the few remaining airlines operating flights to Afghanistan into disarray, including Air India, which cancelled a flight to Kabul scheduled for 12.30 pm on Monday.“Commercial operations from Kabul airport have been suspended [on Monday]. This has forced a pause in our repatriation efforts. We are awaiting the resumption of flights to restart the process,” Bagchi said.Without giving details, he added, “There are also a number of Afghans who have been our partners in the promotion of our mutual developmental, educational and people-to-people endeavours. We will stand by them.”Bagchi said the Indian side is in touch with representatives of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus and will “facilitate repatriation to India of those who wish to leave Afghanistan”.At the same time, the Indian side is “aware that there are still some Indian nationals in Afghanistan who wish to return and we are in touch with them”.Last year, the Indian government helped more than 380 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus to travel to the country.People familiar with the developments said on condition of anonymity that the government is likely to grant refuge to other Afghans who face threats or fear persecution by the Taliban, including civil society activists, journalists and human rights workers.Two NOTAMs or notices to airmen — official notices containing essential information on flight operations — issued by the Afghanistan Civil Aviation Authority said the Kabul airport’s civilian side was “closed until further notice” and airspace over the city had “been released to the military”. The second NOTAM advised all “transit aircraft to reroute” and cautioned that “any transit through Kabul airspace will be uncontrolled”.The storming of the airport raised questions about how much longer aircraft would be able to safely take off and land. The US military and other Western forces continued to organise evacuations, and AP reported the head of the US Central Command met senior Taliban leaders in Qatar and “won their agreement to establish an arrangement under which evacuation operations” can continue without interference.The people cited above said that a few hundred Indians, including diplomats, officials and security personnel posted at the embassy in Kabul, and journalists and citizens were currently in the Afghan capital. Military aircraft have been on standby for evacuation flights and two C-17 Globemaster heavy-lift aircraft of the Indian Air Force have been sent to Kabul via Iranian airspace since Sunday.One of these aircraft returned on Monday, again flying over Iran in order to avoid Pakistani airspace. Officials were tight-lipped about the evacuation flights, citing operational reasons and security concerns, and didn’t give any details, including the number of Indians brought back.Though the Taliban said that fighters in Kabul had been instructed to protect the “life, property and honour” of people, there were reports of the group conducting house-to-house searches to identify people who had worked with the government or US forces, government employees, musicians, reporters and women journalists.Taliban spokesman Suhail Saheen tweeted on Monday night: “We assure all diplomats, embassies, consulates, and charitable workers, whether they are international or national, that not only no problem will be created for them on the part of IEA (Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan) but a secure environment will be provided to them, Inshallah.”However, the people cited above said such assurances couldn’t be taken at face value given the group’s reputation and long-standing links to Pakistan’s security establishment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/repatriation-of-indians-hit-as-chaos-clouds-kabul-airport-101629139232484.html
17-08-2021||India||Concession on 2 daughters rejected in UP draft population bill||The Uttar Pradesh Law Commission on Monday submitted to chief minister Yogi Adityanath a controversial draft population control bill that proposes to bar people with more than two children from local body elections, government jobs, increments and promotions, and restrict their welfare benefits.The 232-page draft of the Uttar Pradesh Population (Control, Stabilization and Welfare) Bill, 2021, was finalised after the commission went through roughly 8,500 public suggestions received over the past fortnight. Some controversial suggestions -- such as keeping people with two daughters outside the ambit of the law -- were rejected.“Rising population is a cause of concern for every nationalist...the commission studied all suggestions in detail and incorporated suitable revisions,” said justice (retired) AN Mittal, chairman of the commission, in a written message addressed to the chief minister.“The state law commission has submitted the draft bill on population control to the chief minister, recommending a specific law for checking population growth,” added justice Mittal, a former judge of the Allahabad high court.The government is likely to table the draft bill in the assembly soon, said people aware of the developments. The monsoon session of the assembly is scheduled to run from August 17 to 24.Uttar Pradesh is scheduled to go the polls early next year.On July 9, the commission uploaded the draft bill on its website seeking suggestions in 10 days (till July 19) from the public. The commission received 8,500 responses on email; out of this, 8,200 backed the draft legislation and 300 opposed it, said the commission.But the draft bill immediately stirred a row, with some experts saying the provisions violated constitutional rights and was aimed at particular communities. Opposition politicians also questioned the timing of the draft bill’s release, alleging it was aimed at vote consolidation ahead of the polls.At least nine other states -- including Rajasthan, Assam and Odisha, among others -- have adopted two-child norms for limited purposes, mainly for limiting candidature in local body elections. The ambit of the draft UP bill has a wider sweep.In its report to the CM, the commission rejected the argument that it violated the right to privacy.“In no way, the right to life and liberty as provided in Article 21 of the Constitution of India is being curtailed. Moreover, if a couple does not want to adopt the two-child norm, then he is free to do so but certain disincentives have been provided under the bill, which cannot be claimed as of right,” the commission said in the report.The draft bill recommends various benefits to public servants and ordinary people who adopt the two-child policy, including financial incentives. It also recommends special benefits to those who have one child and exemption to couples from the two-child policy in case of multiple births out of the second pregnancy and revocation of incentives in case of breach of the two-child norm.Those in breach of the two-child norm may find their government promotions and increments blocked, their ration and other government benefits curtailed, and candidature and nomination to local elections and bodies cancelled -- if the recommendations are accepted. Such people cannot apply for government jobs or receive government subsidies, the draft bill proposes. Exceptions have been carved out for people with disabled children, or in the case of the death of a child.“It shall come into force on the appointed date as may be notified by the state government in the gazette and different dates may be appointed for different provisions of the act,” recommended the draft bill.The commission rejected many suggestions received. Prominent among them were stopping people with more than two children from voting, fighting state and national elections and accessing reservation benefits.It also dismissed a suggestion to allow a third child after two daughters.“The commission has made recommendations for a third child in case there is disability of first or second child or there occurs death of child or any of the child is transgender. It shall be a never ending process to give birth to more children in quest of a male child,” said the commission.The panel also accepted several suggestions, including more incentives for poor families and women from marginalised castes and tribes.The commission expanded benefits for sterilisation from below-poverty-line families to anyone who underwent the procedure voluntarily, and said it was acceptable to link the policy to Aadhaar.On a suggestion that in polygamous relationships, the two children should be counted per man, not woman, the commission said, “Taking into consideration, the large number of suggestions, this aspect shall be reconsidered.”The commission said that if the draft bill becomes law, it should be implemented one year after its notification in the gazette.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/concession-on-2-daughters-rejected-in-up-draft-population-bill-101629139231877.html

A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, added that it has not come across any debate in Parliament or sufficient reason why the same provisions have been brought back by the government in the new Tribunals Reforms Bill when they failed to pass muster in terms of constitutionality earlier. The bench, which included justices Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose, was hearing petitions by advocate Amit Sahni and the Bar Council of Madhya Pradesh when it reproached the Union government for delay in filling up more than 200 vacancies across 15 tribunals in the country even after recommendations made by selection committees, which are usually led by a sitting Supreme Court judge. “We can show you (instances)...Recommendations pending for one year, one year and four months. And we get the same reply every time — ‘It is under process.’ This phrase ‘under process’ means nothing in fact,” the bench told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who represented the Centre. Giving the government 10 days to show progress in appointments, it remarked: “There are tribunals which are on the verge of becoming defunct...It is a serious issue. Just tell us, the tribunals have to function or should they wrap up? This is the only issue now.” The bench also questioned how and why the Union government opted to bring back the same provisions under the Tribunals Reforms Bill which were nixed by the top court on July 14. By its July judgment, the apex court struck down provisions of the Tribunal Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2021, fixing the tenure of members and chairpersons of tribunals at four years. The court said the tenure has to be for five years. However, the new Bill which has been passed by both the Houses of Parliament, re-enacted the same provision, keeping the tenure at four years. Similarly, the minimum age requirement of 50 years, which was quashed by the court in July, still finds a place in the new Bill. The court ruling held that the provision relating to the recommendation of two names for each post by the Search-cum-Selection Committee (SCSC) and further, requiring the decision to be taken by the government preferably within three months, is violative of the Constitution. But the new Bill puts this stipulation back in the statute. Referring to the Bill, the bench pointed out that the Supreme Court has been passing directions regarding the tenure and service conditions of the chairpersons and members of the tribunals since 2017 but the issues were far from being settled. “I have not come across any debate that took place in the Parliament. In spite of all these (court directions), a few days back we have seen, the ordinance which was struck down has been re-enacted. You have come up again with the same rules. We are not commenting on the Parliament proceedings. Of course, the legislature has the prerogative to make laws. At least we must know why the government has introduced the Bill despite being struck down by this Court,” observed the CJI. Justice Ramana referred to a news report which quoted the statements made by Union finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on the floor of the House. “Please show us any debate...what reasons were there? The honourable minister has said just one sentence, that the court has not struck down the provisions on grounds of unconstitutionality. There is no reason given. It is a serious issue. What should we make of this Bill? The tribunal has to function or should they be wrapped up?” the bench asked Mehta. The SG said in response that the Bill has been passed in the wisdom of the Parliament and the new law is not under challenge before the court. “The government introduced the Bill. The ministry must have prepared a note for reasons. Can you show us that?” the CJI asked the SG, who replied that the Bill was yet to be notified as an Act and it will not be proper for him to respond until the notification. The bench then adjourned the matter for August 31 but clarified in its order: “Pendency of the writ petitions and special leave petition before this court shall not come in the way of the Union of India and/or taking an excuse by them for not processing or appointing members in various tribunals.” On August 15, speaking at the Independence Day ceremony, CJI Ramana rued the “sorry state of affairs” in Parliament, where, he said, laws are being passed without constructive debates, leading to legislation with “a lot of ambiguities”. “(Now) we see legislation with a lot of gaps, a lot of ambiguities in making laws. There is no clarity in laws. We don’t know for what purpose the law is made...which is creating lots of litigation, inconvenience, loss to the government and inconvenience to the public.” On August 6, the bench asked the Union government if it wanted all tribunals to be wrapped up since they are unable to function due to a massive shortage of manpower. It had asked the SG to consult with competent authorities and inform the bench about appointments in the tribunals. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-slams-govt-inaction-on-tribunal-vacancies-101629139231402.html
17-08-2021||India||Sisodia writes to HM on O2 deaths panel||Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Monday said that the he has written to Union home minister Amit Shah, urging him to issue directions to lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal to approve expert committee investigation to determine the numbers of deaths due to shortage of oxygen during the Capital’s fourth wave of Covid-19 infections in April-May.Sisodia, in a video statement, said that a file concerning the matter has been resent to Baijal’s office on Monday, and urged that there be more “transparency” in the matter. The Union home minister’s and L-G’s offices did not respond to requests for a comment.In his letter to Shah, Sisodia called it an “irrefutable fact” that shortage of oxygen caused deaths during the recent wave of the pandemic, according to a copy seen by HT. He also alleged that the central government acted in a “hurry” while claiming in Parliament last month that states reported no deaths caused by the shortage.“Deaths caused by shortage of oxygen in Delhi cannot be denied and the Delhi government is in favour of getting it probed. The Delhi government formed a committee for that and the file was sent to lieutenant governor. Today, I have sent the file again to him. We need a probe on the matter. I have highlighted deaths caused by oxygen shortage in a country’s capital in the 21st century is a big thing. As a responsible government, we should not run away from such questions. If needed, we have to improve our systems. Good governance demands more transparency,” said Sisodia on Monday.Sisodia confirmed he had written to Shah. “I have also written about the matter to the Union home minister. We are aware that the central government is also collating data on deaths caused by oxygen shortage. But the numbers cannot be ascertained without a probe. I requested him to issue directions to the lieutenant governor to approve the setting up of an expert committee on oxygen deaths so that we can share accurate details with the central government and use the findings for better governance in future.”The Union home ministry and the lieutenant governor’s office did not comment on the matter.At its peak, Delhi recorded around 28,300 cases in a day on April 20 and the positivity rate exceeded 36% on April 22. Around that time, at least 31 people are believed to have died because of oxygen shortage in two separate incidents in two hospitals – Jaipur Golden and Batra. On May 4, the Delhi government told the Delhi High Court that an expert committee could not ascertain whether 21 deaths at Jaipur Golden Hospital had happened because of oxygen shortage. Later, health minister Satyendar Jain said that it was a “preliminary report”.In June, the Delhi government proposed another expert committee to ascertain the number of deaths caused by oxygen shortage but Baijal did not give it approval, citing a similar committee set up by the Union government – eventually leading to a tussle between the elected government of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi and the lieutenant governor, who is an appointee of the Centre.On July 20, the central government told the Parliament that states recorded no specific cases of deaths caused by oxygen shortage during the Covid-19 pandemic. With that, the AAP government in Delhi, revived its demand for setting up its own expert committee on the matter.“It is an irrefutable fact that during the dreaded second wave of Covid-19 many citizens lost their lives due to shortage of medical oxygen in the country including Delhi during the months of April and May 2021… The Delhi government, realising its responsibilities and accountability towards the family of those who had lost their relatives due to Covid-19 had constituted a high-level committee of medical experts to investigate the incidents in death in Delhi due to lack of oxygen. But unfortunately, the lieutenant governor of Delhi stopped the formation of the high-level enquiry committee at that time,” said Sisodia’s letter sent to Shah on Monday.It further said, “After the issue (of deaths caused by oxygen shortage) was raised in the Parliament, an email was sent by the Union government to all state governments on the evening of July 26 seeking data whether any data is being maintained by them about the deaths due to shortage of medicines, medical equipment, medical oxygen, medical oxygen cylinders, etc… In a hurry on the basis of records made available or non-available, (the) union government in a hurry claimed that no death had occurred due to shortage of oxygen in the country during the second wave of the pandemic. It appears that the government of India does not want to face the truth and somehow hide the deaths that happened due to shortage of medical oxygen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sisodia-writes-to-shah-urges-him-to-tell-lg-to-approve-o2-deaths-probe-panel-101629139048106.html
17-08-2021||India||Indians stuck in Afghanistan struggle to return home||Indian citizens scrambling to escape the Taliban occupation in Afghanistan are facing several challenges, ranging from the inability to get in touch with any embassy official and a sealed airport to difficulties in getting Covid test reports as necessitated by the Indian government for taking a flight, even as the ministry of external affairs on Monday said that the Centre will “ensure the safety and security of Indian nationals in Afghanistan”.A 32-year-old man from Kolkata, West Bengal, working with a local non-government organisationin Kabul for the last two years spent Monday morning in vain trying to reach the Hamid Karzai International airport only to find out that it was shut for commercial flights.Taliban fighters swept into Afghanistan’s capital on Sunday after the government collapsed and President Ashraf Ghani left the country.According to a NOTAM (notice to airmen) issued by the Kabul airport authorities on Monday, the Afghan airspace has been released to the military and any aircraft transit through it “will be uncontrolled”. In another NOTAM, it was stated that the civilian side of the Kabul airport has been shut down until further notice“I managed to reach Kabul airport but there were 8,000 or 9000 people trying to get a flight, none of them had tickets. They were out of control and the airport was guarded by Taliban and they couldn’t control the crowds and so they opened fire. I was running to save my life and later on I came to know that commercial flights are banned and only military flights are allowed,” said this person, who didn’t want to be identified for fear of persecution.India on Monday said it will take all steps for the security of Indians and its interests in Afghanistan and facilitate the repatriation of Sikhs and Hindus who wish to leave the war-torn country.“The security situation in Kabul has deteriorated significantly in the last few days. It is changing rapidly even as we speak. The Government of India has been closely monitoring all developments in Afghanistan,” said external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi.“We had circulated emergency contact numbers and had also been extending assistance to community members. We are aware that there are still some Indian nationals in Afghanistan who wish to return and we are in touch with them,” Bagchi added.While speaking to HT, sirens of police vehicles could be heard behind him. “Even the world’s best analysts couldn’t predict that they (Taliban) will take over so soon... we thought it would take weeks,’’ said this person.He said that he was in touch with several other Indians who were also stranded but they had not heard or got any response from the Indian embassy.“I was supposed to take the last flight out yesterday but couldn’t get a Covid negative report as mandated by the Indian authorities for taking a flight to India. So I booked today’s (Monday’s) flight,’’ he said.“From news reports, we got to know that C-17 flights have been sent by India for evacuation mission but we cannot enter the airport so the embassy needs to respond to our calls and messages... Our lives are in danger,” he said.India had kept C 17 Globemasters on standby for evacuation missions. One of them was sent to Afghanistan on Sunday and a second one took off from the Hindon air force station on the outskirts of Delhi on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indians-stuck-in-afghanistan-struggle-to-return-home-101629139046923.html
17-08-2021||India||Expert panel to review requests for 3 vaccines||Three significant Covid-19 vaccine-related reviews are expected in the forthcoming meetings of the subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Organisation (CDSCO) sometime this week, according to people familiar with the matter.On top of the review list will be Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila’s emergency use authorisation application for its Covid-19 vaccine, ZyCoV-D.The company made the application on July 1 for its three-dose DNA technology-based vaccine, and since then the government’s expert panel has been looking at the rolling review of the trials data that the company submitted as part of the approval process.The interim phase 3 data that the company has presented shows primary efficacy of 66.6%.“The expert panel that is considering the application had sought some more data from the company. It will be difficult to say whether the approval will be granted for sure in the next meeting or not as these are domain experts who follow a thorough process, and need to be convinced about the robustness of the data presented before them. Nothing can influence their decision, so people must rest assured that when approval is given, it is foolproof,” said an official aware of the matter, on condition of anonymity.If approved, it will be the second complete make-in-India Covid-19 vaccine to receive emergency use authorisation after Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, and the world’s first plasmid DNA vaccine for human use.The company had earlier announced that there was enough data to show that the two-dose ZyCov-D regimen also worked equally well as the three-dose regimen that it was originally meant to be. Relevant data was submitted to the regulator for scrutiny.What makes ZyCoV-D an important Covid-19 vaccine is that it has also been tried in about 1,000 children above the age of 12, who were enrolled along with 27,000 other participants at 50 sites across the country for the trial.“If the data supports the claim, it could be the first Indian vaccine allowed for use in children,” said the official.The company’s managing director, Sharvil Patel, last month announced that the company should have a production capacity of about 10-12 million doses per month.Another emergency use application that might be up for consideration with the expert panel is of Serum Institute of India (SII) that applied earlier this month to the national drugs regulator for approval of the Indian version of the American Novavax vaccine that will be manufactured locally under the brand name Covovax.The expert panel may look at the data, but the decision to launch could be hampered by the bottleneck that the vaccine’s developers are facing with the US’ Food and Drug Administration, SII”s chairman and managing director Dr. Cyrus Poonawalla had said last Friday.People familiar with the development said that the trial data could still be reviewed by the regulatory body even if the decision to launch the product is deferred.“Even if the launch of a vaccine is delayed for any technical reasons, the regulators can always look at the data from the trials — both local as well as global — to know about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in general and review. Production process is different from regulatory processes,” said a government official on condition of anonymity.According to SII CEO Adar Poonawalla, the company began clinical trials of Covovax in March and the production of the the first batch began in June.“It is what is called stockpiling which SII also did for Covishield before the vaccine received emergency use approval in January. It is called production at risk,” said the second official.The subject expert committee might also deliberate on the Russian-made single-dose vaccine, Sputnik V, which is being called Sputnik Light. In July, while responding to their application, the CDSCO expert panel had asked the authorised distributors, Dr Reddy’s laboratories, to not go ahead with separate bridging trials for the lighter version and submit the phase 3 data from Russia instead. The data could also come up for review in the upcoming meeting.“The next meeting, whenever it happens, will have some important discussions. The approval process has been streamlined and fast-tracked keeping in mind the pandemic scenario,” said the first official cited above.Meanwhile, also to fast-track quality checks of Covid-19 vaccine batches, the Centre has approved another lab— Hyderabad’s National Institute of Animal Biotechnology— for batch-testing and release of vaccines. Currently, there is a central lab in Kasauli that alone conducts the quality checks.“The move is aimed to strengthen the vaccine supply chain and boost the largest vaccine drive,” said the Union health ministry in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expert-panel-to-review-requests-for-3-vaccines-101629138988893.html
17-08-2021||India||Worried over safety, 150 Sikh, Hindu families huddle up in Kabul gurdwara||AMRITSAR: Concerned over their safety in Afghanistan, particularly after the fall of Kabul to the Taliban, “nearly 50 Hindus and 270 Sikhs” have taken refuge at Gurdwara Karte Parwan in the national capital, making desperate efforts to be evacuated from the war-torn country. Talking over phone to HT, Narinder Pal Singh, a member of parliament in Afghanistan stranded at the Kabul gurdwara said, “Approximately 100 Sikh families are staying at the gurdwara. Though we are feeling safer here, we cannot say anything as the situation is uncertain. There are no flights for us to be evacuated out of the country but we are trying to make arrangements.” Singh is son of Avtar Singh Khalsa, a member of parliament, who along with other Afghan Sikh leaders and activists was killed in a suicide bomb attack in 2018 at Jalalabad. Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president Manjinder Singh Sirsa said, “I am in constant touch with the head of the Kabul gurdwara committee. We have been informed that more than 320 members of minority communities (nearly 50 Hindus and 270 Sikhs) have taken refuge in Karte Parwan Gurdwara Sahib in Kabul in wake of recent developments.”He said, “The Taliban leaders have met them and assured them of their safety. We are hopeful that Hindus and Sikhs would be able to live a safe life despite political churning in Afghanistan.” Hira Singh, a leader of Afghan Sikhs who migrated to India and now lives in Delhi, said, “There are a little more than 60 gurdwaras in Afghanistan. Sikh families were earlier staying at seven gurdwaras of Kabul, two in Jalalabad, two in Ghazni among others. But now, most of them are camping at Gurdwara Karte Parwan in Kabul.”  “I am in touch with our fellow community members in Afghanistan but they are not speaking to us for last two days. I tried calling them twice since today (Monday) morning, but they are declining my calls. We are also worried.” “As per my information, the Sikhs are safe at the Afghan gurdwara. Fortunately, no untoward incident has happened with them yet,” he said. He said, “The Sikhs left Jalalabad and travelled 150 km to the Kabul gurdwara. They are also carrying saroops of Guru Granth Sahib and sacred gutkas (handy books of gurbani) and pothis (gurbani scriptures) from historic Guru Nanak Darbar gurdwara and another Sikh shrine at Jalalabad.”  The men are guarding the foundry wall of the gurdwara, HT has learnt. On the intervening night of Sunday and Monday, some mischievous elements tried to open the gurdwara gate, but those guarding the shrine are learnt to have foiled the attempt. Former DSGMC chief Manjit Singh GK also met Delhi-based Afghan Sikh leaders. “We shall do our best to help our brethren there,” he said. “Though the Taliban have assured them of their safety, their evacuation is paramount in such a situation. We are establishing contact with the Centre as well as representatives of the Canada and UK governments to carry them to safety,” said Ravi Singh, founder head of the Khalsa Aid, a humanitarian organisation. Puneet Singh Chandok, president, Indian World Forum, said, “We are in constant touch with ministry of external affairs (MEA), Air India and some international agencies for early evacuation of Indians and Indian-origin people from Afghanistan.” Meanwhile, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi on Monday said India is also in touch with representatives of the Afghan Sikh and Hindu communities in Afghanistan and will facilitate the repatriation of those who wish to leave that country. “The situation in Afghanistan is being monitored on a constant basis at high levels. The government will take all steps to ensure the safety and security of Indian nationals and our interests in Afghanistan,” Bagchi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/worried-over-safety-150-sikh-hindu-families-huddle-up-in-kabul-gurdwara-101629138686797.html

17-08-2021||Today's||In Kabul, the centrality of Pakistan||The Indian mission in Kabul has been closed. While it may have been for security considerations, it sends out a message about India’s current irrelevance in shaping the political reality in Afghanistan.At the same time, the visual manifestation of Pakistan’s current centrality was manifested, above all, in the visual images of Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi welcoming a delegation of leaders of the erstwhile Northern Alliance at the Pakistan foreign ministry in Islamabad on August 16.For me, these images were far more telling of Pakistan’s success than those of the Taliban in the palace complex of Kabul or occupying the speaker’s chair in the Indian-built Parliament building in Kabul.Also Read | AI to operate flights till Kabul airport remains functional: Indian envoyIn the Afghan delegation were many leaders I had got to know well during the dark years of the Taliban control of Afghanistan in the 1990s, and later as India’s ambassador to the country from March 2002 to January 2005. What was most striking in the Afghan delegation was the presence of two brothers of the legendary leader of the Afghan jihad — the one who had never bowed before Pakistan — Ahmed Shah Masood. He was the most remarkable man I had the privilege to have known in my diplomatic career. Masood was the soul of the Tajik stronghold of Panjshir, a centre of resistance to the Soviets and later to the Taliban. One of his brothers, Ahmed Zia Masood, served for five years as president Hamid Karzai’s first vice-president; the other, Ahmed Wali Masood, was for long years a prominent Afghan diplomat during the anti-Taliban struggle.Also in the group was Yunus Qanooni, Ahmed Shah Masood’s close aide, an astute negotiator, who was a prominent minister in Karzai’s cabinet and his principal rival in the 2004 presidential election. Later, from 2005 to 2010, Qanooni served as speaker of Parliament. The visit to Islamabad in the wake of the Taliban entry into Kabul would have been especially poignant for Qanooni — he was the first Afghan leader to have entered Kabul after the Taliban exit in November 2001; the moment captured forever in an iconic photograph.In the group were also the two great Hazara leaders, Karim Khaleeli and Mohammed Mohaqiq. The latter had shown exemplary courage in staying within Afghanistan to fight the Taliban in the 1990s when it was displaying a special animus against the Shia Hazaras. Khaleeli had served as a vice-president of the Republic and Mohaqiq held ministerial and high executive office. Their present priority would clearly be the safety of their Hazara compatriots.Also, in the group was former foreign minister Salahuddin Rabbani, son of the president Burhanuddin Rabbani whose government held Afghanistan’s United Nations (UN) seat all through the years the Taliban was in Kabul. He was assassinated in 2011 by a Taliban suicide bomber. And now the Taliban had easily overrun the Rabbanis’ Badakhshan stronghold.All these leaders have harboured deep reservations, even anger, against Pakistan. It would not have been easy for them to go to Islamabad to seek its intervention to get the Taliban to conduct itself responsibly in its hour of victory. And they are all doubtless fully knowledgeable about Pakistan’s enormous role in the Taliban’s success. That they have gone to Pakistan and not come to India has a clear message. They are aware that India can now simply play no role at all in the unfolding of events in Afghanistan.India’s statement to the UN Security Council meeting on Afghanistan on August 16 contained elements of a grudging acceptance of Afghan developments. There was no demand that it would not recognise a government formed by force. There was no repetition of the “double peace” formula. It noted, “A broader representation would help the arrangement gain more acceptability and legitimacy”. The key word is “arrangement”. Its use denotes a desire to still keep options open, even though India has no role in working out the political structure that will now be put in place in Kabul.Clearly, India is aware that there are intense ongoing negotiations about the nature of the dispensation that will now take control in Afghanistan. It is particularly noteworthy that the Taliban leadership has shown no great hurry in announcing the new administration. Not only Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar but other either Doha or Pakistan-based Taliban leaders did not rush to Kabul to take charge. This is indicative of the sophistication with which it is approaching its next moves.What seems to have happened is that the Taliban shadow apparatus has moved to take control at the provincial level to prevent total chaos and anarchy. The terrible scenes at Kabul airport should not mask the reality that, in the rest of the country, there is calm, if an uneasy one. The worry of the international community on the human rights front is justified for there have been unacceptable incidents. Yes, what is clear is that the Taliban will not give up its flag or the formulation of the “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan” even if it agrees that the new dispensation will include non-Taliban leaders. It will also keep an iron grip over the security and the intelligence apparatus of the country.The absence of a central authority cannot continue much longer. Will India accept it, irrespective of the nature of this authority? Or will it be sullen? The heightened dangers in its western neighbourhood demand the pursuit of cold realism.Vivek Katju is a retired diplomat The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-kabul-the-centrality-of-pakistan-101629192753509.html
17-08-2021||Today's||Meghalaya: When two wrongs don’t make a right||Last week, Meghalaya’s capital city of Shillong was placed under an extended curfew after violent protests erupted in parts of the city. The protests were the result of the killing of former militant, Chesterfield Thangkhiew, of the banned military group, Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC), during a police operation.According to the Meghalaya Police, it undertook the operation following “irrefutable evidence” that the former militant was involved in the explosion of an improvised explosive device (IED) in Shillong. The raid, which took place in his home, has raised allegations of human rights abuse and has drawn widespread condemnation because of how the operation was conducted.Soon after the operation, hundreds of Thangkhiew supporters marched through the city with black flags to attend his funeral procession. However, the funeral then became a hotspot for extremist militancy, as fringe elements seized the opportunity to whip up support. What initially began as a legitimate demand for accountability after the disproportionate use of force on the accused, eventually developed into a campaign for violence and extremism. Videos and photographs of crowds pelting stones at law enforcement officials went viral on social media. Society looked on in shock as visuals of masked men atop an SUV brandished rifles stolen from police personnel.Also Read | Meghalaya orders judicial probe into police encounter of militantWhile the police operation itself must be condemned for the excessive use of force during the raid, the violence, arson and mayhem that followed are counterproductive, and thereby, a disservice to the cause.The demand for accountability and an independent investigation was fulfilled by the state government, which announced that a magisterial inquiry supervised by the National Human Rights Commission would be conducted. A parallel inquiry by the Meghalaya Human Rights Commission directed the chief secretary to submit a report. These were then followed by the decision to appoint a judicial inquiry to investigate the operation, shortly after the state’s home minister tendered his resignation.The HNLC is responsible for a dark period in Meghalaya’s history, when it reigned over brutal executions and extortion activities. A report from 2004 details how the HNLC received ₹4.2 crore annually from extortion and other illegal activities — which was sent to its leaders in Bangladesh. It was banned twice, first in 2000 (which was lifted), and then in 2019 by the central government. The Centre stated that its activities are detrimental to the sovereignty and integrity of India.Thangkhiew was the founding general secretary of the HNLC, who surrendered in 2018. The IED blast in a market in Shillong injured two people who worked there. The HNLC, which claimed credit for the blast, received flak from across society for targeting innocent citizens, and rightly so.Militant groups such as the HNLC have no place in Indian society. They must not receive societal support and their acts of extremism must be unequivocally condemned. There is no doubt about this. But, as this case has proved, extra-judicial killings are equally damaging to society. Therefore, instead of advocating further violence against law enforcement personnel — which can be harmful to the campaign for an independent inquiry and also to the state — the way forward would be a thorough inquiry into the police raid. This can be a catalyst to ensure that a similar incident does not occur in the future.The state government’s inability to prevent a breakdown of law and order, coupled with the unacceptable actions of extremist groups, has resulted in a huge loss to our society. The state government’s decision to extend the suspension of the internet, following the misuse of social media to spread propaganda and hate speech, hurts citizens across the four districts. It disconnects students from their teachers in a country reeling from the effects of a pandemic, impedes business activities, and stifles individual freedoms. There has to be a better way, for two wrongs cannot make a right.Jade Lyngdoh is a constitutional law honours candidate, National Law University, Jodhpur The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/meghalaya-when-two-wrongs-don-t-make-a-right-101629192273995.html
17-08-2021||Today's||In promotion policies for the military, keep politics out||A recent news report regarding a proposed review of the selection criteria for promotion to the higher ranks of the Indian military (three-star) has elicited considerable attention and preliminary comment in the security community. While details of the review are yet to be formally announced, a muted unease is palpable that this could be the beginning of the gradual erosion of the current system, where each service — the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force — have evolved their own promotion policies for higher ranks leading to appointment as commander-in-chief (C-in-C).The Indian armed forces have a steep pyramid-like structure for promotion to the higher ranks unlike the civil services. In the military, less than 5% of those who are commissioned in a year make it to three-star — while in the civilian cadres, almost 95% reach the top tier of pay and allowances with the introduction of the non-functional upgrade.Thus, peer competition at each selection rank in the fauj is intense, and the professional competence of an officer is evaluated annually by way of the annual confidential report (ACR) that can make or mar careers. Hence, individual merit is the primary metric for promotion in each rank, and this determinant acquires greater salience as the gradient becomes steeper in the three-star aspiration.Also Read | Billions spent by US on Afghan army ultimately benefited TalibanThe practice that has been followed to date is that a combination of merit and vacancies are the deciding factors for promotion. This evaluation is done by promotion boards in each service, with the chief being the final authority. For appointment as C-in-C and service chief, a slate of potential candidates who meet all the criteria is prepared and sent to the defence ministry for final approval. The seniority principle applies only for elevation to four-star (service chief) and has been usually followed, though there have been departures — General AS Vaidya (1983) and General Bipin Rawat (2016) are cases in point.The news report indicates that in the future, promotion to higher rank will be “primarily on merit rather than seniority”, and that the objective would be to evolve “a more progressive, common and merit-based” policy for promotions to three-star rank in general, and C-in-Cs in particular. This is intriguing, for current promotions are based on merit alone, and seniority is invoked only for the chiefs.However, one presumes that with inter-service synergy and theatre commands on the anvil, there is a case for a review and evolving a common template among the armed forces apropos of promotion policies. Tenures in joint formations and units will have to be accorded due weight for promotion and this is a logical tweak of existing procedures.The word “progressive” may connote the ability to discharge tri-service responsibilities. It would be fair to assume that such training of today’s one-star officers (brigadier and equivalent) is imperative as theatre commands become a reality in a phased manner.Merit-based promotions taking into account professional competence and personal integrity are highly desirable in any organisation, and more so in the military. The current model for promotions to higher rank recognises merit as the primary determinant (hence, the centrality of the ACR).But to prioritise “merit” again at the two-star to three-star level (major general to lieutenant general and equivalent in the other services) is incongruous and the trigger for the muted unease — about the objective of the review. However, until more details are made available in the public domain, it may be prudent to note the proposal and flag some major elements of the military hierarchy and the civil-military interface.Hierarchy and seniority are sacred in the military and obeying orders is a deeply instilled characteristic of the uniformed fraternity. Senior officers have an enormous professional responsibility to discharge and, when in command, they are directly responsible for the lives of the personnel under their charge. This is unique to the military and gives the institution its distinctive ethos — the use of force — within the framework of the Constitution and the law, to safeguard national security interests.Nurturing human resources within the military is a rigorous professional calling and each service has its inherited traditions and time-tested procedures. The results were evident in 1971 in the war for Bangladesh, and again in Kargil in 1999.This success on the battlefield was preceded by the debacle of October 1962 against China — and the latter ensued due to unwarranted political interference in professional and operational matters that were in the Army domain. The Jawaharlal Nehru-VK Krishna Menon blunders resulted in an absurd exigency, where a three-star general from the service corps (ASC) was directing the battle in the North East Frontier Agency from a hospital in Delhi.Civilian oversight in military promotions is part of the current promotion template and has its utility in review and redress where required, for there have been aberrations. However, allowing “merit” to become a euphemism for a political endorsement could be a slippery slope for the professional credibility and integrity of the military as an institution.Espousing empathy with the ideology of the ruling party and behaving in an unctuous manner to curry favour with the political apex have become benchmarks for promotion in other institutions. This ought not to be the new template for the Indian fauj.Commodore (retired) C Uday Bhaskar is director, Society for Policy Studies The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-promotion-policies-for-the-military-keep-politics-out-101629191613365.html
17-08-2021||Today's||Why India must not abandon Afghanistan again||I have visited Afghanistan several times in the last decade. One thing that kept my optimism alive since September 2014 — the announcement of the date of drawdown of international forces by United States (US) President Barack Obama — was the sense of unity that Afghans displayed when the Flag Foundation of India gifted Afghanistan its largest flag. Afghans proudly stood under it, as it fluttered magnificently on top of a high mast on the Wazir Akbar Khan hilltop in Kabul.Right before Afghanistan celebrates its Independence Day on August 19, the flag could soon be brought down, to be replaced by one of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, led by the Taliban.The Taliban, though an astonishingly swift and largely bloodless military blitzkrieg, has occupied almost the entire country, including Kabul. The fleeing of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and a host of women parliamentarians marks an abrupt rupture of the democratic experiment in Afghanistan of the last two decades. In a matter of days, the international community will have to swallow the bitter pill and internalise the reversal of its gains in the two-decades-long engagement in the war-torn country.Also Read | Kabul streets turn silent a day after chaos; evacuations continueFor India, which pledged more than $3 billion in development assistance since 2001 and accrued a huge amount of goodwill, Afghanistan is now a dramatically transformed terrain. The impressive parliament building built by India will be occupied by the Taliban. Likewise, the road and other projects built by India will now be under Taliban control.As the US faces now less than a Saigon moment, New Delhi, too, seems to have been caught on its back foot. Having hedged its bets on the Afghan government and led by US assurances, it seems to have stripped off all leverages it had painstakingly built.Historically, Afghanistan has demonstrated the limits of great power interventions. Could things have been different this time around? Could the Indo-US partnership, growing from strength to strength, have provided an answer to the turnaround of events in Afghanistan? Could India have played a greater role inside and outside Afghanistan to prevent the loss of a strategic partner and demonstrate its leadership role at the United Nations? More important, does India have a Plan-B to preserve its gains of the last two decades? These are some of the questions which need long-term thinking and astute diplomacy.US Secretary of State, Antony J Blinken’s visit to New Delhi in July had raised a lot of expectations for both countries to reaffirm their strategic convergence on a host of issues. The critical issue of Afghanistan, however, was clearly not discussed adequately during his meetings with the external affairs minister S Jaishankar and ministry officials.Notwithstanding the fact that both India and the US have tremendous stakes in the future of Afghanistan, policies of both seem to display a sense of forlorn disconnect to influence the unfolding events.With its own select preference and isolated success in promoting and upholding democracy around the world, for the US, Afghanistan has come to represent a classic example of the limitations of great power. The experiment to set up a functional democracy in the last two decades remained extremely fragile, marred by the enduring challenges of insecurity, fraud-marred elections and also by corruption, ethnic divisions and the self-aggrandising political elite. Regional powerplay added fresh complexities. The peace deal with the Taliban concluded by the Donald Trump administration in February 2020 and implemented vigorously by the Joe Biden administration merely ended up enabling the Taliban capture of power.In the new Afghanistan, New Delhi faces disruption to its intense engagement in the country’s development sector. Its gains of the past two decades, achieved through painstakingly built high-value and small-scale projects, face reversal. India, a regional stakeholder and an unwavering supporter of an “Afghan-led, Afghan-owned, and Afghan-controlled” peace and reconciliation process, has struggled to find a place in the numerous groupings that seek to decide the fate of the country. Its last-ditch efforts at opening a channel of communication with the Taliban, as part of its bid to engage with all stakeholders in the Afghan conflict, too, has not yielded much result.New Delhi faces a stark choice of engaging the Taliban or opting to completely disengage from the country. The latter would imply a return to the 1990s, where a contact vacuum facilitated events like the IC-814 hijacking and anti-India groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed finding bases in that country. A realist approach would be to reach out to the Taliban to continue aid and development assistance, and seek to link aid with conditionalities that will help in mainstreaming and blunting the extremist worldviews particularly in dealing with women, minorities and children.Internationally, India must take a leadership role as the current United Nations Security Council chair in framing resolutions, providing relief, setting up humanitarian response teams and conflict mediation mechanisms. India cannot afford to abandon the people of Afghanistan once again without implications for its image as a reliable friend and a major power in the region.Dr Shanthie Mariet D’Souza is founding professor, Kautilya School of Public Policy, Hyderabad and founder-president, Mantraya.

17-08-2021||Editorials||The Centre must shed its ambiguity on Pegasus||The Centre has adopted an opaque approach to the Pegasus revelations. In Parliament, the new information technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw’s defence rested on the fact that there has been no illegal interception. Responding to a written question, the ministry of defence said it had not procured any such software — thus washing its hands of the affair, but this left open the question of whether other government departments and agencies had done so. Another ministry cried off a question claiming the matter was sub judice. And with the Centre avoiding a discussion on the issue as demanded by the Opposition, the entire monsoon session was disrupted.In the Supreme Court, which is hearing a bunch of petitions on the matter, the Centre denied the allegations in the petitions, saying they were based on “conjectures, surmises, unsubstantiated media reports or incomplete or uncorroborated material”. It also offered to set up a committee of experts to go into all aspects of the issue.Also Read | Afghanistan will shape international normsSolicitor General Tushar Mehta, on behalf of the Centre, then used the national security argument, pleading that any public disclosure on whether or not the software was used would harm the security of the State, enable terrorists to take preventive steps, and said that the government was willing to divulge details to a committee. The court has issued a notice to the Centre and will take up the matter in 10 days again.The Centre is tying itself up in knots to evade the central question in this case — did the government of India procure Pegasus, and did it authorise its use? To suggest that disclosing this will help terrorists isn’t a smart argument, for they probably already operate based on the assumption that the Indian State has this technology. More importantly, the State owes an answer to citizens, who do not constitute a threat to it, about whether there has been an invasion of privacy, a fundamental right. The government must shed the ambiguity even if the answer is an uncomfortable one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-centre-must-shed-its-ambiguity-on-pegasus-101629198214757.html
17-08-2021||Editorials||Afghanistan will shape international norms||After the end of the Soviet Union, during the unipolar moment — of United States (US) hegemony — the doctrine of humanitarian intervention picked up. This was based on the notion that sovereignty was not sacred, and that if a regime was involved in human rights violations, the international community was within its rights to intervene in a particular country. This principle was picked up by two different streams of thought. The first were the neo-conservatives who, during George W Bush’s era, argued that promoting democracy and enabling regime change was a legitimate extension of humanitarian intervention. The second were liberal internationalists who extended the principle to evolve a doctrine of the responsibility to protect (R2P) — if a State failed to protect its population from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, then other states could take timely, collective and decisive action.Also Watch |What Taliban Takeover means for India : On The RecordTo be sure, as many states including India had suspected, this principle — either under the pretext of humanitarian interventions, counterterrorism, R2P, or democracy- promotion — was used for strategic purposes by Western states. Interventions were often a function of the power balance that existed at the time; they were also driven by the military-industrial complex, and served ideological and commercial interests. But in itself, the idea that no regime could use sovereignty as an excuse to harm its own population marked an evolution in norms.The fall of Afghanistan may well have eroded the entire architecture of Western interventions. If the US, as Joe Biden’s speech defending the withdrawal on Monday indicated yet again, is not willing to step up to protect minority, women and human rights, and can leave Afghans at the mercy of a brutal regime which has a record of rights violations, it will be hard for Washington to justify its intervention elsewhere in the future on these principles. The rise of China has already added a protective buffer to authoritarian regimes. This does not mean that interventions won’t happen in the future — they will, dictated by narrow State interests, as has always happened. But the abrupt end of an invasion meant to counter terror, create a democratic political order and protect human rights may have ended up eroding the political, moral and legal argument for such interventions itself. The possible dilution of global military interventions is positive. But if it emboldens despotic regimes, like the one taking over Kabul, the world is headed for more turbulent times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/afghanistan-will-shape-international-norms-101629197733963.html
