16-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh tricity: Covid cases climb for second week in row||Even as the tricity had a breather on Monday with just five new Covid-19 cases, the trend in the past two weeks has raised concerns across the three health departments.The number of Covid-19 cases continued to rise for the second consecutive week after showing a constant decline since the second wave peak in May. As many as 86 people tested positive in the tricity in the week ending August 15 (Sunday), as compared to 65 in the previous week. Earlier, the weekly cases had dropped to 50 (July 26-August 1). Medical experts believe the uptick is due to the apathy and complacency on the part of locals, who have stopped following Covid-appropriate behaviour, especially wearing of face masks.Even though cases in Chandigarh and Panchkula are fairly consistent, there has been a significant rise in Mohali. In August, so far, 82 cases have been reported in Mohali, followed by 57 in Chandigarh and 21 in Panchkula. Meanwhile, no death owing to the virus has been reported this month, and even daily positivity rate has mostly remained below 1% across the three jurisdictions. It was on July 31 when the tricity had last reported a death. A breather on MondayThe tricity’s daily tally dropped to a single digit, after a week, on Monday. As compared to 10 cases on Sunday, only five were reported, with two each in Chandigarh and Panchkula and one in Mohali. The active caseload, which had crossed the 100 mark on August 13, stood at 111, with 55 cases in Mohali, 43 in Chandigarh and 13 in Panchkula.So far, 68,537 people in Mohali have tested positive, of whom 67,425 have successfully beaten the virus and 1,057 have died. In Chandigarh, 61,177 out of the 62,031 patients have recovered and 811 have died. Of the 30,661 patients in Panchkula so far, 30,272 have recovered and 376 have lost their lives.‘Keep following protocol’Even though experts say it is too early to declare the third wave, they advised people to keep following the Covid-19 safety protocol.“In Chandigarh, we have not seen a significant rise in cases yet, as most people are already vaccinated. However, we have learnt that people have stopped wearing face masks, especially in restaurants and public places. This attitude is an invitation to the third wave,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director, health services, Chandigarh.Mohali civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur said: “Since cases have started increasing in the district again, we have stepped up daily testing and contact tracing. People must get vaccinated at the earliest and follow the safety protocol to avert another peak.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-tricity-covid-cases-climb-for-second-week-in-row-101629138507981.html
16-08-2021||Gurugram||Lack of space for compensatory afforestation forces officials to look at other districts||The Gurugram forest department has started searching for land in other districts to conduct compensatory afforestation on 700 hectares, officials said on Monday, due to paucity of space for the same in Gurugram.Rajeev Tejyan, the divisional forest officer of the Gurugram forest division, said, “With different projects started in the past few years, almost 700 hectares of compensatory afforestation is yet to be completed. The delay is mainly due to a lack of land availability in the district. There are several conditions that need to be met before starting any afforestation project. We have now started looking for land in other districts such as Panchkula and Faridabad.”At present, Gurugram officials are undertaking compensatory afforestation near Morni-Pinjore in Panchkula district to compensate for the greenery cut for the Gurugram-Pataudi road widening project. Almost 8,000 trees were felled in the district for widening this road to have four lanes. Officials said that compensatory afforestation for some projects was carried out in Faridabad district. According to records, almost 25,000 trees were felled in the district between 2013 and 2018.The afforestation process is carried out through Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA). The funds given under this initiative by the Central government are used for protecting the environment, compensating for losses incurred by deforestation and mining. The law aims to reimburse ecological damage caused due to the transfer of forest land.A senior forest official, wishing not to be named, said, “We cannot carry out compensatory afforestation near roads as the trees would have to be felled if the road needs to be widened. Similarly, there is land available with panchayats in the district, but it cannot be done there too as panchayats can ask for their land back. The purpose is to develop substitute forests for trees that are being cut for infrastructure projects, but due to lack of land, we have started looking outside the district too.”The official further said that the department is not able to carry out plantation in land falling under the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) due to lack of clarity, as in many places, private land also falls under PLPA.According to directives of the Supreme Court, the PLPA attracts protection under the Forest Conservation Act of 1980, which states that “no state government or other authority shall make, except with the prior approval of the central government, any order directing that any forest land or any portion thereof may be used for any non-forest purpose.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/lack-of-space-for-compensatory-afforestation-forces-officials-to-look-at-other-districts-101629138091117.html
16-08-2021||Gurugram||Govt may build check dam around Najagfarh lake: Khattar||Even as the Haryana government is yet to submit an environment management plan pertaining to the Najafgarh lake with the National Green Tribunal (NGT), chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Monday said that the government is considering construction of check dams (bundhs) around the lake to prevent flooding of around 5,000 acres of agricultural land located in its vicinity. Stating that he was aware of the problems faced by villagers, Khattar said, “Activities are ongoing at the state level to resolve the issue. The deputy commissioner has submitted the report to the state wetland authority. Under this, technical and financial subcommittees have been formed. Also, the plan is to build a dam on the slope side of the lake to stop water from inundating the agricultural land.”Khattar was in the city to attend the monthly grievance redressal meeting where the issue was raised by the Badshahpur member of the legislative assembly (MLA) Rakesh Daulatabad. Construction of a dam near the Najafgarh drain to prevent flooding has been a longstanding demand of farmers in the area. In 2019, farmers wrote to the state human rights commission, demanding the construction of a check dam and compensation for losses due to flooding. On June 17 this year, the principal bench of the NGT asked the Haryana government to submit an environment management plan (EMP), which has been pending for the past 10 months. The next hearing is scheduled for October 10.Since sewage water from nearby villages is also drained in the area, the CM said that daily-use water from Dharampur village has to be processed by a sewage treatment plant before it is discharged. According to the district administration officials, sewer lines from Dharampur village will be connected to Jahajgarh village, where an STP of 20 MLD capacity is being constructed and will be functional by March 2022.However, experts were against the construction of a check dam at Najafgarh.Ritu Rao, a PhD scholar at the TERI School of Advanced Studies, who specialises and works on urban water bodies and has been working on the Najafgarh lake, said, “Building a check dam near the lake will block the only outlet for stormwater in Gurugram. With climate change, Gurugram is facing extreme precipitation in a short span of time, which leads to urban flooding; this will only increase in future. Further, to build a check dam, undulated terrain is needed, whereas the area in question is not such a land.”The seven-square kilometre Najafgarh Jheel is an important water body for Gurugram as it acts as a large aquifer to recharge groundwater. Many creeks in the Aravallis flow into the Najafgarh Jheel, which is further carried to the Yamuna. The lake is located in a natural depression in southwest Delhi, close to the Gurugram-Rajokri border on National Highway-48. It is fed by the Najafgarh drain, which has a sizeable catchment area in Gurugram. A portion of the lake falls in Haryana. The Haryana government is yet to submit an environmental management plan for the lake, giving details of how the area along with its ecology will be protected. The Delhi government, in the last hearing, had submitted a draft EMP to the NGT. Experts working for the protection of the lake have been demanding that the Haryana government declare the water body a wetland till 212.5 metres above mean sea level, in accordance with the high flood level of the past 100 years. If it is done lower than that, then there is a risk of flooding and collapse of the buildings constructed on this land as the Najafgarh Jheel is a natural hazard zone. CM IN CITY Besides the Najafgarh issue, at least 12 other complaints were placed before the CM, including issues pertaining to the ongoing construction work at Atul Kataria crossing that is likely to be completed by November 30, availability of differential global positioning system machines to measure land and encroachment of land in villages. Over 33 complaints were to be placed before the CM, of which at least 20 complaints were resolved before the grievance meeting. Khattar, on Monday, also inaugurated the drinking water supply project set up for sectors 81 to 99. The project is a part of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority’s (GMDA) three-phase plan to lay water pipelines in newer sectors, 58 to 115, at a cost of ₹235 crore. Officials said that the first phase was constructed at a cost of ₹76.21 crore and it will cater to around 380,000 people.Giving a presentation to the CM, GMDA chairman Sudhir Rajpal said that at least 229 water licences have been issued in these sectors. Among them, 56 licensees have received occupation certificates from the town and country planning department. Currently, these colonies are dependent on water tankers for their daily water requirement. He said that the department faced hurdles at 47 spots while laying the pipeline, according to the district administration statement. Khattar also virtually inaugurated a waste-to-energy plant worth ₹176.87 crores in Sonepat and Panipat. The project has been set up under a public-private partnership and will produce eight megawatts of electricity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/govt-may-build-check-dam-around-najagfarh-lake-khattar-101629138089977.html

16-08-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19 detection: Third round of serological survey likely this month||The third round of the Covid-19 serological survey that was scheduled to be held in June is likely to be conducted in the last week of August, covering about 3,000 people in the district. According to officials, the estimated sample size for every district has been decided by the state health department, based on which a micro plan has to be submitted on Tuesday.“As directed by the state, the survey will be held in 75 clusters. It includes 45 in rural and 30 in urban areas. Details on the age-wise coverage of the population and the final dates for the survey are yet to be shared by the state health department. But a training session for health workers will be held this week. Blood samples will be collected to check for IgG antibodies. It will provide information on the proportion of the population having antibodies to fight Covid-19 even if they did not have symptoms or receive a diagnosis of Covid-19,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer of Gurugram.Generally, a serological survey is done to detect the body’s immune response to coronavirus infection.Across the state, the survey will be done among 36,520 participants. According to Yadav, it will be done next week and will continue for two to three days. The highest number of samples will be collected from Gurugram, while only 800 samples will be taken from Palwal, which has the lowest case count in the state.As per the plan in June, over 3,520 children of six to 17 years were to be covered in Gurugram, while the total sample size was 8,800. Of this, 5,280 were to be adults, 2,640 children of 10-17 years and 880 children of six to nine years.Haryana conducted two rounds of serological surveys in 2020. During the first round of the survey in Gurugram, the seropositivity rate of the urban areas was 18.5%, while in the second round, it increased to 25.9%. Likewise, in rural areas, it increased from 5.7% in the first round to 10.1% in the second round. In both surveys, over 800 people were tested for the antibodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-detection-third-round-of-serological-survey-likely-this-month-101629138087549.html
16-08-2021||Gurugram||Electric vehicles zone set up, 600 vehicles launched in first phase of project||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Monday launched the city’s first electric three-wheelers zone (ETWZ), where only electric autos and e-rickshaws can ply. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar flagged off these vehicles, as part of the Parivartan project, from Galleria Market in DLF Phase 4 on Monday morning.Officials said that 600 electric three-wheelers are currently on the roads and users can book a ride via an app created by its concessionaire. Around 550 of these vehicles are e-rickshaws while the rest are e-autorickshaws. Fares for the ride will be the same for both vehicles, officials said.In the electric zone, diesel and compressed natural gas (CNG) powered autorickshaws are prohibited. A violation of the rule will lead to traffic police officials penalising the offending driver and also impounding their vehicles, in case of repeated violations.Areas of Cyber ​​City, Golf Course Road, MG Road, Iffco Chowk, Huda City Centre, Galleria Market, Sushant Lok-1, Vyapar Kendra Road and Hamilton Court Road have been included in the electric three-wheelers zone.Khattar said that the high level of air pollution across Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) is a matter of concern and vehicular pollution is a big problem. The CM said that cleaner modes of public transport, such as e-rickshaws and e-autorickshaws, are a priority.“Vehicular pollution has been an issue not just in Gurugram, but across NCR. Through the Parivartan project, the government aims to lower air pollution by switching to a non-polluting mode of travel. The change is necessary,” said Khattar.He said that initially, the ETWZ will be limited to just MCG’s Zone 3, and that it would later be implemented across Gurugram and other Haryana districts as well. “The main aim of this project is to replace 5,000 diesel autorickshaws in Gurugram with e-rickshaws and e-autorickshaws, through subsidies and financial aid to diesel autorickshaw owners and drivers,” said Khattar.The project was launched by the MCG in collaboration with Gurugram traffic police, Haryana transport department, and SmartE, a private electric mobility service and MCG’s concessionaire for the project.The concessionaire is responsible for looking after the operations of the three-wheelers and the recharge stations, said officials.Currently, there are five electric parking and charging hubs, at Udyog Vihar, Wazirabad, Huda City Centre, MG Road Metro station and Sikanderpur Metro station. More charging hubs are proposed to come up in DLF Phase 3, Guru Dronacharya Metro station and Galleria Market.MCG officials said that a fare of ₹30 for the first two kilometres and ₹10 for each subsequent kilometre has been set for private rides that can be booked through the SmartE app. For shared rides, the fare is fixed at ₹10 for the first two kilometres and ₹5 for each subsequent kilometre. However, shared rides cannot be booked through the app.Regarding the financial aid provided to diesel autorickshaw owners and drivers switching over to e-rickshaws or e-autorickshaws, Khattar in his speech said that the MCG, under the Union government’s Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of hybrid and Electric vehicle (FAME) scheme, is providing a subsidy of ₹30,000- ₹35,000, along with scrap cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/electric-vehicles-zone-set-up-600-vehicles-launched-in-first-phase-of-project-101629137907337.html
16-08-2021||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Covid-19 cases on rise again in state capital||In a worrying trend, the number of daily Covid-19 cases is once again on the rise in state capital Ranchi after it recorded cases in double digits on atleast four days last week, as per the latest data shared by the health department on Monday. Prior to this, the city clocked daily cases in single digit over last several weeks. As per the health bulletin, 79 cases were detected in the state capital in last six days of the past week. With this, the number of active cases across the state crossed the 200-mark. Almost 50% of these active cases are in Ranchi district. According to health officials, the recent rise in cases is due to influx of passengers from other states. “Majority of these new cases are being detected at the railway station and the airport. Sporadic cases are being registered among locals as well. However, most cases are those alighting at Ranchi airport and station,” said Dr Vinod Kumar, civil surgeon, Ranchi district. The fact that the health department is unable to do contract tracing of such cases allegedly because passengers were giving wrong contact details is also worrisome.The civil surgeon said they have requested the district administration to take corrective measures. The issue was raised at a review meeting chaired by Patna deputy commissioner, Kumar said. “The passengers are giving wrong contact details. From Tuesday, test centres would test the mobile numbers provided by incoming passengers. A request has also been made to increase police deployment at the airport and station to ensure all passengers are tested,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-covid-19-cases-on-rise-again-in-state-capital-101629133767471.html

The proposal was passed in the first meeting of the panchayat without any opposition with 50 out of 72 members in attendance. “It was a long pending demand to rename Aligarh as Harigarh. The zila panchayat approved the proposal unopposed. It would now be forwarded to the state government for approval,” stated Vijay Singh, zila panchayat chairman for Aligarh. A proposal was also passed to name the airport of Aligarh after BJP leader Kalyan Singh, informed the zila panchayat chairman. Kalyan Singh was a resident of the ‘Lock City’ and chief minister of UP during the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Aligarh division comprises Hathras, Etah and Kasganj districts. Earlier in the day, the zila panchayat of Mainpuri passed a resolution seeking to rename Mainpuri as Mayan Nagar after sage Mayan who founded the present day Mainpuri, said members. “One of the zila panchayat members had moved the proposal for renaming Mainpuri as Mayan Nagar and the proposal was passed on Monday with 23 members supporting the motion and two opposing it,” said Archana Bhadoria, zila panchayat chairperson of Mainpuri.

16-08-2021||Patna||Bihar’s fee waiver policy to boost PG enrolment stuck since start in 2015||On February 3, 2015, the Bihar government took a policy decision to provide free education to all girl students as well as those belonging to SC and ST up to post-graduation level. This meant no fees would be charged from the students of identified categories and the government would reimburse the financial loss to institutions. It was then said the move would cost the state exchequer about ₹29 crore annually and benefit nearly 4.05 lakh students in the three categories spread across 262 constituent colleges, including 28 girls’ colleges.The move was necessitated by the finding that enrolment of the three categories in PG had dropped significantly. More than six years later, none of the girls’ institutions, except Patna University once, has been reimbursed the fees to meet their recurring expenses. Some of the institutions that tried to take fee in anticipation of reimbursement have landed in legal wrangle, with the Patna High Court asking the government to return the fee amount to the students, some of whom had moved court. “The principal secretary, department of education, shall ascertain information with regard to disbursement of the amount recovered from the students from the three categories provided freeship and file his personal affidavit stating the latest position. He shall immediately convene a meeting of vice chancellors of all universities and ensure that the fee illegally recovered is refunded to the students forthwith,” said the bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Sanjay Kumar in July. After that, additional chief secretary (education) Sanjay Kumar held a meeting with the V-Cs to gather information on the issue. “We have reimbursed ₹6 crore to Patna University once, but it has not happened for other universities. We can reimburse only if there is claim presented in the prescribed format. We have asked the V-Cs to submit their claims,” he said. The problem of reimbursement had started surfacing the very first year after the colleges started charging fee on the pretext that it would be refunded on getting funds form the government. Many college principals had then sought reimbursement from their respective universities also, but things remained unattended. “After all, colleges have various recurring expenses and they cannot wait for reimbursement from the government, which has not happened even once in six years. With admission fee and tuition fee structure of 1952, the colleges hardly earn enough revenue to manage the recurring costs on library, laboratory, cleanliness, electricity and telephone bills,” said the principal of a college in Patna who did not want to be identified. A senior official said there was no reason why one university would be reimbursed, and others not. “The problem is that the universities are not sending claims as it should be. For reimbursement, details of students availing waiver with fees are required. Many colleges submitted overall figures, without details. The government has made the policy and it will certainly reimburse, as it happened in the case of PU,” he said.

16-08-2021||Patna||Nitish praises Modi for OBC bill, says keen to meet him on caste census||Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi deserves praise for removing the confusion on state’s right to decide on other backward castes (OBCs).“The states had the right to decide on OBCs earlier also. In Bihar, former CM Karpoori Thakur also created a separate category for extremely backward classes (EBCs). Different states have done it differently, as they were empowered to do so. There was, however, some confusion for the last few years. After the court order, the Centre decide to clear it that states continue to have the right,” he said, reiterating his demand for caste census, saying it would be in the interest of the country and it was for the Centre to decide. Talking to media persons after his weekly “Janata ke durbar me mukhyamantri” programme, Kumar, who unfurled the Tricolour for a record 15th time as Bihar CM on Sunday, said he had received the acknowledgment to his letter from the prime minister on caste census on August 13. “Now whenever he deems fit, he will give time and we will discuss the matter with him. If it has to be done at the state level, it will be decided through a unanimous decision after talking to all sections. At present, we are waiting for time from the PM to discuss the matter with him,” he said.Partition Horrors Remembrance DayOn PM’s announcement to observe August 14 as the Partition Horrors Remembrance Day, Kumar said there was nothing wrong with it, as nobody wanted Partition of the country. “Bapu (Mahatma Gandhi) was also against. He never wanted it, but it happened and the anger resulted in his assassination. The pains of partition are natural. My father was a freedom fighter and he used to narrate us everything. The new generation should also get to know of it,” he said.Ayansh parents go for helpAt the CM’s weekly programme on Monday, the parents of Ayansh, a 10-month-old child from Patna who is suffering from a rare disease called spinal muscular atrophy and needs an injection worth ₹16 crore to get cured of the disease, also reached there to meet Kumar, but officials just took their representation as his registration was not completed. The parents of Ayansh have so far collected around ₹6 crore through donations and have sought the remaining amount in government assistance. Last time, when the CM was asked about Ayansh, he had said that all should support it, but the government did not have any such scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/nitish-praises-modi-for-obc-bill-says-keen-to-meet-him-on-caste-census-101629130646614.html
16-08-2021||Patna||JD(U) chief skips RCP’s function amid talks of rift, Nitish says all is well||Factionalism within the ruling Janata Dal (United) in Bihar came to the fore on Monday when senior party leaders, including its national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh and party parliamentary board president Upendra Kushwaha, stayed away from the programme organised to felicitate former party president and union minister R C P Singh though chief minister Nitish Kumar, the de facto leader and face of the party, “laughed off speculation” of a rift. “I have not been invited. I have not received any information or letter regarding the function. So how can I join? I have to go to Jehanabad for an event. I came to know about his visit only through media,” Kushwaha told reporters. The former union minister, who joined JD (U) in March this year, however, was quick to add that there was no factionalism in the party. “There is no factionalism in the party. Those who are indulging in such things will fall flat,” he said.What further fuelled the talks of a rift between RCP and Lalan Singh on Monday was the initial absence of photographs of the party president and parliamentary board president in the posters put up to welcome the newly appointed union minister on his first visit to Patna after his swearing-in. Their pictures were restored only after their supporters raise a hue and cry, party functionaries said. “The disappearance of Lalan Singh’s picture from the banners and poster made to welcome RCP Singh is intolerable. He is the national president of the party and his role should be understood by everyone,” said Kushwaha. Lalan Singh was not available for comment.CM Kumar, meanwhile, dismissed talks of differences in the party as “laughable”. Referring to the welcome accorded by party workers to RCP Singh in Patna on Monday, Kumar said, “When Lalan Singh arrived in Patna after being made the party president, he was also accorded welcome. Today, the same happened with RCP Singh. Why should there be any differences? When I see such speculation in newspapers, I cannot resist laughing. I was the president. I handed over charge to RCP Singh and when he became union minister, he handed over charge to Lalan Singh,” he said after his weekly “Janata durbar me mukhyamantri” programme.RCP Singh too was quick to dismiss talks of any rift, saying he has very cordial relations with Lalan Singh. “There is only one leader, Nitish Kumar, in the party. Others work under him,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/jdu-chief-skips-rcp-s-function-amid-talks-of-rift-nitish-says-all-is-well-101629130346821.html

Located in Campeerganj tehsil area (50km north of Gorakhpur), Balua village was in the headlines after detection of 17 fresh Covid cases on August 12. Though cases are on the decline in Uttar Pradesh, the sudden Covid surge in this sleepy village drew the state government’s attention and medical teams were rushed to launch containment drive.Interestingly, the village is located in Gorakhpur district, but the health team was sent from the neighbouring Maharajganj district.Newly elected gram pradhan Sambhu said around 8,000 residents of Balua village are trapped in “an administrative dichotomy.” Health care services in 28 villages, including Balua village in Gorakhpur district, are run by the Maharajganj district administration, he said.“When the spread of Covid was reported in the village, we were virtually tossed between the two districts. The officers of Gorakhpur administration told us that health teams from Maharajganj district will launch the treatment, sample collection and contact tracing drive, whereas the officers of the Maharajganj district said that the village is located in Gorakhpur district, it’s the responsblity of the Gorakhpur health department to launch the containment drive,” he said.Medicine distribution and sample collection were delayed. Finally, the health team from the CHC in Dhani town in Maharajganj launched the health services, door-to-door survey and Covid vaccination drive,” said Sambhu.“We are facing the problem since 1989, when Maharajganj district was carved out of Gorakhpur. The area faces flood fury and outbreak of encephalitis every year. While relief and rescue operation operations are carried out by the Gorakhpur administration, the treatment to sick children is provided by the Maharajganj administration,” he added.“The Campeerganj health centre is 11 km away, but we have to cross river Rapti to visit the Dhani health centre in Maharajganj district located 20 km from the village. For over two decades, we have been demanding that health services to the 28 villages be provided by the Gorakhpur health department. We are getting mere assurances from the MPs, MLAs and officers,” said Sambhu.Chief medical officer, Maharajganj, Dr AK Srivastava said no fresh Covid cases have been reported in Balua village after August 12. “Health workers had collected 1,000 samples for laboratory test (between Aug 8 and 12) under the contact tracing drive. The reports of the samples were negative while medical kits have been distributed among the people who tested positive earlier and staying in home isolation under constant surviellance of health teams. A health team is camping in the village to organize the Covid vaccination drive,” he said. Dr Sudhakar Pandey, CMO, Gorakhpur said after report of Covid cases an alert was sounded in the Campeeragnaj tehsil area. “The district health department is monitoring the situation. There is large migration of people to various parts of the country from the area and health teams are collecting details of people arriving from Mumbai, Kerala, Karnataka, West Bengal and Punjab where the spurt Covid has been reported,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-fight-against-covid-up-s-balua-village-caught-between-two-districts-101629128186818.html

16-08-2021||Pune||Pune continues to be a district of concern, RT-PCR positivity rises compared to last week||Pune: Even as the Pune administration has relaxed Covid-19 restrictions since August 8 and allowed shops to stay open till 10 pm and malls for fully vaccinated staff and customers, the district has reported a slight rise in the RT-PCR positivity. Many districts in the state are seeing a drop in RT-PCR positivity than the state average of 3.10% between August 8 and August 14. Among the districts of concern, which have reported a higher Covid-19 RT-PCR positivity rate, than the state average for the same period, are Pune at 6.10%, Ahmednagar 7.1%, Sangli 7.3%, Satara 7.0% and Solapur at 5.5%. The combined positivity rate for the district is 5.5% which is higher than state combined positivity at 2.9%. Pune has been in list of above state average for over two months. The number of new cases from rural area add to the increased positivity rate which is an important criterion to relax restrictions. Pune’s RT-PCR positivity rate which stood at 5.9% between August 2 and August 8 has risen to 6.1% between August 8 and August 14. Although this might seem like a small jump, increase in RT-PCR positivity reflects the spread of infection in the area. Combined positivity rate includes Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) which may also show false negatives. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, state Covid-19 advisor, said, “The drop in cases in Vidharbha is a positive sign and at the same time these districts which continue to remain of concern need to be looked at too. Until now we do not know the role delta-plus variant plays in this, however, all variants of delta are of concern. What can be controlled is people following Covid-appropriate behaviour strictly. People in Pune demanded to open up more commercial activities and also relax restrictions, but at the same time they need to be aware that coronavirus is still around.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-continues-to-be-a-district-of-concern-rt-pcr-positivity-rises-compared-to-last-week-101629124705360.html

Talibani forces have reportedly sealed Afghanistan’s Torkham and Chaman borders with Pakistan, the only two land routes used for trade activities from India to Afghanistan and vice-versa. India traders import dry fruits, onions and apples from Afghanistan. The Integrated check post (ICP), Attari, which facilitates India’s trade with Pakistan and Afghanistan, has been receiving goods only from Afghanistan since New Delhi abrogated Article 370 in August 2019. In 2019-20, the ICP had recorded a business of ₹2,767 crore, which dipped to ₹2,500 crore in 2020-21. Prior to this, the ICP had been recording a trade valued between ₹4,000 crore and ₹5,000 crore trade a year.“We and our counterparts in Afghanistan are worried. Taliban has taken control of Torkham and Chaman borders. We also hear reports that the Taliban has promised to not disrupt any trade activity in transit routes. The situation will only be clear over the next two-three days,” said, Anil Mehra, president, Federation of Karyana and Dry Fruit Association.“It takes around four-five days for a goods truck to reach the ICP after its departure from Afghanistan. On Monday, five trucks with dry-fruit reached the ICP,” said a Customs official, who didn’t wish to be named. He added, “There is one more worry. Trucks transporting goods to India also carry documents that the Afgani government issues. With the collapse of the regime, how will these trucks bring the required documents? Even if the Taliban allows trade, the Centre’s stand will also matter.”“Afghanistan mostly send us dry fruits, which are perishable. There are no arrangements for importing dry fruits via sea or air. We hope that the two land routes are opened for import, as the dry fruit is also not that far away,” he added. Hundreds of porters, working at the ICP, could also be rendered jobless. “We are already suffering as the trade with Pakistan has been shut two years. If import with Afghanistan also stops, our children will die of hunger,” said a porter Lakhwinder Singh.Trade at the ICP has been diminishing gradually since the Pulwama terror attack of February 2019, in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed. After the attack, India had increased duty on items imported from Pakistan from 5% to 200%. In August, 2019, when New Delhi abrogated Article 370 which gave special powers to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan had ceased trade with India. The neighbouring country had also barred India from exporting goods to Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/taliban-takeover-of-kabul-traders-at-icp-a-worried-lot-over-import-from-afghanistan-101629123807054.html

But it all started with Stokes introducing viable apple cultivation at Barubagh in Kotgarh in 1916. The Delicious variety of apples, which Stokes introduced, is now grown in parts of Kullu, Shimla, Mandi, Sirmaur, Kinnaur, Lahaul and Spiti and Chamba districts.“Stokes contribution to the hill-state should be immortalised, “ says Subash Kainthla, a Zila Parishad member from Bhutti-Thanedhar ward in Kotgarh, “Stokes’ statue should be installed on the Ridge. If Yashwant Singh Parmar (the first chief minister of Himachal Pradesh) is called the architect of Himachal, then Stokes’ too revolutionised the state’s economy.” Kainthla was among the 100 farmers paid floral tributes to Stokes, who was born on August 16, 1882, at a small statue installed in his remembrance. A small event was also organised at the Thanedhar panchayat. “Farmers in the region have demanded that Stokes’ birthday should be commemorated as apple day,” Kainthla said. The journey from Samuel Evans to Satyanand A year after the young Christian missionary arrived in Shimla in 1904 to join a leprosy mission, an earthquake ravaged Kangra and killed more than 20,000 people and Stokes walked from village to village, helping the affected. In 1912, he visited Kotgarh and settled there, marrying a local Christian girl, Agnes. Later, he entered Arya Samaj and changed his name to Satyanand.Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, he joined the Congress and fought for India’s independence.Stokes wasn’t the first to introduce apple to the state, but it was his contribution that went a long way in transforming the apple economy. Captain RC Scot of the British army was the first to bring the fruit to the Kullu valley in 1870, but his variety was not viable economically. Stokes’ red, delicious variety was from Louisiana in the US. He planted an apple orchard on his Thanedhar estate in 1919 and taught the techniques to locals.The apple bowlApple is the most important fruit crop of Himachal Pradesh, which constitutes about 49% of the total area under fruit crops and about 79% of the total fruit production. The area under apple has increased from 400 hectares in 1950-61 and 1,12,634 hectares in 2017-18.The area under temperate fruits other than apple has increased from 900 hectares in 1960-61 to 28,369 hectares in 2017-18. The apple economy alone is pegged at ₹2,900 crore.As many as 450 cultivars (plants propagated through stem cuttings, not via seeds) of apple collected from all over the world, a majority from the United States, Italy, China and New Zealand are grown in seven districts of the state, namely Shimla, Kullu, Sirmaur, Chamba, Mandi, Kinnaur and Lahaul and Spiti.Last month, actor Kangana Ranaut, who hails from the hill state, had also urged the Himachal government to build a memorial for Stokes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/himachal-farmers-want-stokes-birthday-memorialised-as-apple-day-101629123508883.html

The UPite has completed a decade in Mumbai and calls it as his learning period than struggle. “Meri pyaas initi gehri hai ki mujhe kabhi pareshani nahi hoti (My thirst to learn is so great that nothing is ever a problem for me). I have gone through very tough times in these last 10 years, but I never felt it was a struggle. This is my dream, and I am on a path to achieve it, so all this is my learning,” says the actor who comes from Lukmanpur Baheda village in Shahjahanpur.The actor has featured in films like The Attack of 26/11, Baby, Special 26, Killing Veerappan and recently in Shershaah.“Sometimes I even wonder how I managed to reach here! In my village, we did not have a radio or TV. We are a family of farmers, and as a child, I remember delivering milk cans. Mine is the first generation in the family which went to school,” tells Rahaao.He recalls watching a patriotic play where freedom fighter Bhagat Singh’s brother, Kartar Singh was present. “I was in Class 5 then and decided that this is what I wanted to do. For graduation, I went to Shahjahanpur where I started doing plays with different theatre groups. I tried for NSD but could not get through. In my third attempt, I got through Bhartendu Natya Akademi (2008), Lucknow. Padma Sri Raj Bisaria saheb and our director Suryamohan Kulshresthaji were my mentors. I did many plays under Rajji including the lead in King Lear.” Soon, he got a play Shifa of which he did 50 shows throughout the country and saving some money, left for Mumbai. “My film role was in Special 26 in which I was in the title of 26 people but technically I was in a crowd. In Ram Gopal Verma ’s Attacks of 26/11 I played Abu Ismail who was the leader of the terrorist gang followed by Killing Veerrapan in which I had a good role. I also acted in Les Cowboys, Neerja, Kissebaaz, Indian’s Most Wanted and Shershaah in which most roles are of Pakistani characters.”He has restricted himself from doing TV and advertisements. “I am focusing on films and OTT. I have played the lead in a 49-minute monochrome film Chalne Do which has gone to many festivals. After the lockdown, I shot for the series Mum Bhai and have also done a role in Akshay (Kumar) sir’s film Raksha Bandhan.”Rahaao is eying big roles but is content with doing small roles in big projects too. “I am fine with small roles in mega projects, as in them, besides acting, I present myself to the cast and crew who later become filmmakers themselves. Be it RGV or Neeraj (Pandey) sir, all have repeated me many times. I am not in a hurry and am here to play a long innings. Trust me, it’s very tough to sustain even today but I never think of quitting and will surely make it big. I believe my time has come,” says the actor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/i-am-here-to-play-a-long-innings-rahaao-101629119725691.html

This comes in the wake of her family alleging foul play. The Goa Police had first said that she died of drowning and ruled out rape or murder when the autopsy found no evidence of sexual assault or injuries.Sawant said, “The Crime Branch will assist in the investigation.” The mother of the deceased said, “We want justice. Whoever has done this needs to come out. If she killed herself by drowning, why was the body not bloated? Even her stomach was not filled with water. It only had the breakfast she had taken.” Her father said, “I dropped her at the bus stop and I saw her board the bus. Then I proceeded my way. I got a call ten minutes later from a cousin who works at the mall (along with her) that she hadn’t reached. I asked her to wait a little more as sometimes the bus is slow, but she never reached.” Also Read | ‘India only G20 nation to meet climate goals’The missing persons report was lodged shortly before 1pm on the day she went missing. Police say they reached out to a bus conductor at Mapusa (that lies in the direction opposite to where the victim was headed) who recognised her and said she was alone at the time. The family has handed over her mobile phone to the police in the hope that it will offer some clue leading to her death. “I have met the SP and I am convinced that the truth will come out,” the father said after a late evening meeting with top brass of the Goa Police on Sunday.Shobit Saksena, Superintendent of Police(North Goa) said, “We are conducting a detailed probe in the matter and have preserved viscera for forensic analysis.”The Opposition has demanded a thorough probe into the death. “I have asked the chief minister for a complete investigation. The case should be handed over to the Crime Branch,” local BJP MLA Glenn Souza Tico said. The incident evokes memories of the death of British teenager Scarlett Keeling who was found dead on Goa’s Anjuna beach in February 2007.

16-08-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: Pune should create more effective youth engagement in climate change||Youth in Pune are definitely aware and receptive about climate change; we don’t need to be convinced that it is happening. However, we need more engagement on what to do about it”, says Aditi Kale, independent researcher and coordinator Climate Collective Pune. Aditi’s view matches the findings of a recent study on young people and drivers and barriers to climate adaptation action (2021 Youth Report) conducted by the Global Centre for Adaptation (GCA) with partners, including Centre for Environment Education (CEE). Understanding how to adapt is essential for young people who will live with these impacts in the coming decades. They are current and future decision-makers. Their local, national, and international engagement is vital for building resilience and developing effective adaptation policies. The purpose of the code red by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) with its Assessment Report 6 is to caution us about the impacts of climate change and spur action. Action is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as to adapt to climate change impacts. Consequences of climate change include the extreme rainfall events and flooding and heatwaves experienced in recent weeks. Youth in India and other developing countries already face difficulties to access education, health services, livelihoods and jobs. The consequences of climate change, such as illnesses, deaths, loss of household assets and livelihoods, come on top of these circumstances. Poorer households are worst-affected and take much longer to recover from such adversities. The 2021 Youth Report says that the failure to include young people in policy processes remains the most critical hurdle for youth engagement in policymaking. Pune should take note and create much broader and more effective youth engagement in climate change and sustainability. In this context, here are two opportunities for young people to be involved in policy dialogue and local actions. The TCS Sustainathon, launched on Independence Day by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) along with challenge partners the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), SWaCH and the Adar Poonawalla Clean City Initiative, is an exciting opportunity for school and college students in Pune. The challenge is to develop creative solutions for zero waste communities, waste to wealth, empowering waste handlers, and taking responsibility for the waste one generates. Strengthening circular economy, livelihoods and work conditions of waste handlers are an integral part of climate action. The second opportunity is the Local Conference of Youth (LCOY) events by YOUNGO, the official youth constituency of the United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Change. LCOY India 2021 is being organised online by the official host Centre for Environment Education in early October, focusing on youth actions for ecosystem restoration solutions. The policy recommendations, outcomes and suggestions of LCOY will be presented at the United Nations Climate Change Conference of Youth (COY). The COY will occur before the Conference of Parties which will be attended by the government delegations in Glasgow in October this year. The 2021 Youth Report highlights the strengths of youth: technology and social media savviness, their desire to connect across age groups, and a strong willingness to step up and act when facing extreme weather events. These characteristics have enormous potential to strengthen adaptation policies and climate resilience. As Harshad Barde from SWaCH said at the Sustainathon launch event on Sunday, “Those who are already working in the system often don’t try new things due to cynicism. Youth can create radical innovations and challenge the old set ways, which are sometimes part of the problem”. The report also cautions that “the burden of coping with climate change impacts and adapting should not be placed on young people alone when serious impediments to their participation in political processes exist in many societies”. As a city with a relatively larger youth population, Pune has the opportunity and the responsibility to foster youth learning, participation in decision-making and action for climate resilience in a free and supportive social environment.

The ANA officers, including cadets in the first and the second semester, are on pre-commission training at IMA for a one-year course as per a strategic partnership agreement between India and Afghanistan signed in 2011 under which India has been providing military training to Afghan military officers. An army officer confirmed there are over 80 Afghan cadets training at IMA. On the recent development in Afghanistan, he said on condition of anonymity, “The young cadets are worried for their families back home...Their trainers and faculty members are constantly supporting them and trying to keep their morale high.” The officer added, “Even as their future seems uncertain as the ANA seems to have collapsed, the IMA is not stopping their training.” Also Read | In Afghanistan, the limits of Indian powerMeanwhile, IMA public relations officer, Lt Col Himani Pant, said the training academy has not received any communication from the Afghan authorities till Monday following the developments in their country. “As of now, we are imparting training to the Afghan cadets in IMA,” she said. Afghan cadets comprise the majority of foreign cadets undergoing training at the IMA. In the last passing out parade held in June, a total of 84 foreign cadets passed out, of whom 43 were from Afghanistan. ANA officers said they were angry at the Afghan political leaders more than anybody else. One of the officers, who passed out from the IMA in December 2018 and was deployed in the ministry of defence of Afghanistan till Saturday, told HT over WhatsApp, “We are angry with the politicians of the country who are political traders. They sold out our motherland and left the people of Afghanistan to their fate. More than any foreign power or Taliban, it is them who destroyed this country. People of Afghanistan will kill them one by one once this crisis ends,” he said. Despite repeated attempts, officials at the Afghanistan embassy couldn’t be contacted till the time of filing of this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/over-80-afghan-cadets-training-at-ima-worry-about-situation-back-home-101629115585400.html

In Bihar, former CM Karpoori Thakur also created a separate category for extremely backward classes (EBCs). Different states have done it differently, as they were empowered to do so. There was, however, some confusion for the last few years. After the court order, the Centre decided to clarify that states continue to have the right,” he said, reiterating his demand for the caste census, saying it would be in the interest of the country and it was for the Centre to decide.

If it has to be done at t he state level, that is a separate issue. It will be decided through a unanimous decision after talking to all sections. But right now, that is not the issue,” he said.Kumar said that he had been advocating the need for caste-based census across the country for a long time. “It was done separately between 2011-13, but the report did not come out. We want it to be with the Census at least once to have a clear picture, as it will help in planning and policy-making for they weaker sections,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/decision-on-state-level-caste-census-only-after-centre-s-response-bihar-cm-101629115525169.html

16-08-2021||Pune||Your Space: Getting ready to tackle possible Covid third wave in Pune||The state government has relaxed Covid curbs again following a drop in virus cases and positivity rate. With reports of new variants of the virus and medical experts predicting a third wave, readers suggest steps that authorities should take to ensure citizens strictly follow prevention norms... Public participation, awareness must to contain virus spread The state is now reopening businesses that were shut down for months due to the Covid-19 lockdown. As daily caseload in the state goes down, the decision to reopen becomes imminent for trade and businesses, as well as for commoners. However, with regard to the chances of a third Covid-19 wave, authorities need to step up to the task of ensuring all safety protocols related to the virus are strictly followed. Till now, the Covid-19 inappropriate behaviour of the public often went unnoticed for the most part due to various reasons. Hence, this time the authorities can take the help of shopkeepers to ensure that citizens follow preventive norms at public places. There must be a consensus between authorities and shopkeepers not to allow anyone in the shop unless they have a mask on and it may also be made mandatory to have taken at least one shot of the vaccine. The authorities can determine the high-risk areas with the help of already available data and create a separate task force to focus on these areas. Setting up Covid-19 testing booths, stepping up vaccination drives in that particular area, and safety protocol awareness are some of the measures that could help contain the spread. Furthermore, it has been seen that the patient with mild symptoms of Covid-19 prefers to take medicines without getting themselves tested. Awareness and efforts shall be made to carry out more tests and the patient should be able to get tested near their house. Apart from that, in housing societies, the onus can be put on the society board members along with the local police station to ensure that no one is flouting the safety protocols. Lastly, the importance of wearing a mask cannot be stressed enough. In Pune itself, police have collected ₹43 crore in fine for not wearing masks in the last 16 months. Tougher restrictions and mandatory quarantines can be levied on those who have found to be regularly violating the safety protocols. Mihir Shete More vaccination and tests needed The second Covid wave was four times more devastating than the first one, according to a study. Kerala, which successfully tackled the second wave, reported 50% new cases last week. The third wave is inevitable, only the scale is not known and the time is unpredictable. All the states and the central government must ensure that the vaccination and testing won’t go out of sight. Children are not vaccinated till date therefore they are the most vulnerable to new variants. Few vaccination of adults will create trouble for children because if children get affected in the third wave then their parents need to be with them in hospitals. And if parents are not vaccinated then they will risk their life for their children. All the state governments have to frame a policy of cooperation, they must not be seen fighting with each other during the time of nationwide emergency. The central government really have to ensure that children won’t gasp for oxygen during the crisis. Prolonged lockdowns have severe impact on the livelihood of people, imposing repeated lockdowns without proper vaccination is an ill-thought policy. Santosh Bhagat Following Covid appropriate behaviour like fundamental duty It has been more than a year that we all have been observing the pattern of Covid. We saw that the wave is coming after every three months of relaxation, but now the Covid has many variants of the virus which have become dangerous. And it is spreading at a higher rate than earlier. Many states, including Maharashtra, have started giving permission to shops and malls to be operational as per regular time. We should never forget that the virus is still among us. We should always keep this in mind that only 13% of the total population in India is vaccinated. So, we can say that 87% are at risk. In order to be safe, following the Covid appropriate behaviour is like a fundamental duty to protect the health of all. Authorities should take following steps to curb the third wave: Vaccination: The only answer available to fight Covid today is vaccination. So, the government should increase the rate of vaccination. Genome sequencing: Authorities should be alert to find if there is any new variant of virus. Testing and tracing people with symptoms and isolating them will help to curb spread of any other variant. Test trace and isolate: Even if positivity rate is reduced, authorities should not reduce the testing rate. It is the main weapon to predict the wave and predict if there is any new variant of the virus. RT-PCR testing at public places will help in curbing the spread. Actions against people not following Covid appropriate behaviour: Authorities should be strict so that people will not forget to follow prevention rules. Public awareness: Authorities should be making the public aware about new variants or rising cases in their area. Housing societies, apartments where cases are increasing should be sealed and patients should be isolated. Though there are many steps that authorities should take to curb the third wave, but the real answer lies with us. If we follow the basics of Covid, we would win this battle. Apurv Londhe Follow the rules or let the virus follow you Many prominent personalities like India’s principal scientific advisor K Vijay Raghavan and medical experts have already told us that a third wave is inevitable - it could only be curbed if people continue to take strong measures. Even in July, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told in a conference that last year we had the same trends of cases rising from Maharashtra and Kerala that lead to a disastrous second wave in India. As we all are already having an experience, we should be prepared mentally, economically and medically to curb the next wave. Steps that authorities should take to curb the third wave include door-to-door vaccination. It would also create awareness about vaccination and help in controlling the spread of virus. Authorities should allow only vaccinated people to open shops or there should be mandatory weekly Covid tests for shop owners and workers. Even though the virus cases have dropped, the government should avoid mass gathering events such as exams, rallies, festivals and such events. The third Covid wave is inevitable, but learning from past experiences we can be prepared for medical emergencies that can arise during this tough times which includes providing oxygen beds and maintaining proper inventory of essential drugs required in treatment of patients. We should have learned this from our earlier experience. It is very straight and simple – Follow the rules or let the virus follow you.

16-08-2021||Kolkata||TMC celebrating ‘Khela Hobe divas’, BJP counters with save Bengal day||The Trinamool Congress is celebrating Khela Hobe Divas (Game on day) on Monday across West Bengal and a few other states including Tripura, following a call on July 21 by party chief and chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s to mark August 16 as Khela Hobe Divas to promote sports.‘Kela Hobe’ was used as a rallying call by the TMC in the recently held assembly elections in the state. Coined by a TMC youth leader, the slogan became immensely popular and was used repeatedly by Banerjee during the campaigning while challenging the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).During the Khela Hobe Divas celebrations, Bengal sports and youth affairs department is handing out more than 100,000 footballs to various sporting clubs and organising football tournaments throughout the state.The BJP, however, plans to counter the TMC with ‘Paschim Banga Bachao Divas’, which translates to Save West Bengal Day. Top leaders of the BJP’s state unit, including the party’s president in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh, and the leader of Opposition in the state legislative assembly Suvendu Adhikari, will hold demonstrations in central Kolkata against post poll violence that allegedly lead to deaths of several BJP workers.“In our childhood, we used to play football with either pomelo (fruit) or a plastic ball. But now sports have a different connotation. It is all politics, hatred and [a] game is going on for cut money [a byword for illegal commission] and syndicate. We want sports and games to return to keep an individual healthy and fit,” said Dilip Ghosh.The BJP has objected to the choice of date for Khela Hobe Divas, saying it was a reminder to Muslim League’s Direct Action Day, observed on August 16, 1946, when a large number of people were killed in communal violence during protests. Last week, Suvendu Adhikari led a delegation of Hindu religious leaders to request for governor Jagdeep Dhankhar’s intervention to change the date for the TMC programme.The TMC however brushed the objections aside claiming that Bengal was saved in 2011 when Mamata Banerjee first came to power.“West Bengal was saved in 2011 when the TMC came to power. In 2024, the TMC will save India by ousting the BJP government at the centre,” said Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-celebrating-khela-hobe-divas-bjp-counters-with-save-bengal-day-101629091943685.html

16-08-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana Police gets new chief, PK Agrawal succeeds Yadava||Prashanta Kumar Agrawal is the new Haryana director general of police (DGP). He succeeds Manoj Yadava, who has sought repatriation to the Intelligence Bureau. The Haryana government announced the appointment of the 1988-batch Indian Police Service officer on Sunday. Agrawal will have a two-year tenure. Also read: Army chopper crash: Pilot’s body recovered, search on for co-pilotThe empanelment committee of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) had last week shortlisted a panel of three senior-most Haryana IPS officers for selection of the new DGP. Besides Agrawal, two 1989-batch officers, Mohammad Akil and RC Mishra, were shortlisted. Yadava sought repatriation to IB The state government had last month set in motion the process to appoint the new police chief after Yadava sought premature repatriation to the IB, citing career consideration and family requirements. Subsequently, a proposal containing the names of eight IPS officers was sent to the UPSC for shortlisting three senior-most officers. Seven IPS officers who have put in 30 years of service and were eligible for empanelment were in the zone of consideration. Besides Agrawal, Akil and Mishra, they included 1990-batch officers Shatrujeet Kapoor and Desh Raj Singh and 1991-batch officers Alok Roy and Sanjeev Kumar Jain. Minimum tenure of two yearsAccording to the directions of the Supreme Court, the state DGP shall be selected by the state government from among the three senior-most officers of the department who have been empanelled for promotion to that rank by the UPSC on the basis of their length of service, good record and range of experience for heading the police force. “Once selected, the DGP should have a minimum tenure of at least two years irrespective of his date of superannuation,” said the 2006 landmark Prakash Singh judgment of the apex court. The court had in March 2019 clarified that the recommendation for appointment to the post of DGP by the UPSC and preparation of panel should be purely on merit from officers who have at least six months of service prior to the retirement. Yadava had been the state police chief since February 21, 2019. His two-year tenure had ended but the Union home ministry on March 2 granted him an extension till February 20, 2022, or till further orders, whichever is earlier. Yadava, a 1988-batch IPS officer, is left with four years of service before he attains superannuation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-police-gets-new-chief-pk-agrawal-succeeds-yadava-101629086543342.html

I called Janani Express (an ambulance service for pregnant women). But when the ambulance driver reached the village, he said he couldn’t drive inside the village due to the poor condition of the road. We were left with no option but to cover around 2km by foot on the muddy road,” Neelam’s husband Pankaj Adivasi, a resident of Bihradongri village in Satna district, said.“Neelam couldn’t hold the baby in her womb [during the walk] and gave birth on the road,” Pankaj added.Pankaj said while he was fortunate that both his wife and child were saved, he felt his family was treated very badly by the “corrupt system” that he said was “apathetic” to common man’s woes. “In every rainy season we face this problem as the road becomes muddy and unmotorable. Many times, we have staged protests demanding a pucca (tarred) road, but nothing has happened,” he said.Block medical officer Dr Sarvesh Singh said the ambulance driver didn’t go inside the village after realising that there was a 100% chance of the vehicle getting stuck in the muddy road. “But after the delivery on the road, the ambulance driver and attendant safely brought the woman and her baby to the hospital. Now, they are absolutely fine.”Satna district collector Ajay Katesaria has ordered an inquiry in the matter.(With inputs from Amit Singh from Satna)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-woman-gives-birth-on-muddy-road-as-ambulance-couldn-t-enter-village-101629081983564.html
16-08-2021||Kolkata||West Bengal to celebrate 'Khela Hobe Divas' today||West Bengal will celebrate ‘Khela Hobe Divas’ on Monday, as announced by chief minister Mamata Banerjee last month. While addressing the TMC annual Martyrs Day rally on July 21, Banerjee announced that the state government would observe ‘Khela Hobe Divas’ on August 16 every year.While addressing a crowd at Kolkata's Netaji Indoor Stadium earlier this month, Mamata Banerjee announced a scheme under the same name. As part of the scheme, the West Bengal sports and youth affairs department will hand more than one lakh footballs to various sporting clubs. "The 303 clubs under IFA (Indian Football Association) are being given 10 balls each, and Mohun Bagan, Mohammedan, and East Bengal are being given 100 balls each as a token," she said.The term 'Khela Hobe' gained prominence during the West Bengal assembly elections this year. The Bengali words translate to ‘game on’ and Banerjee repeatedly used the slogan against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which was the main contender against the TMC during the polls.Banerjee renewed the battle cry she made during the state assembly elections in July, adding the fight will continue till BJP is ousted from power at the Centre. "Khela Divas, which will be marked by the distribution of footballs to needy children," she said on July 21, according to news agency PTI.TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh had said, “Khela Divas will be observed to promote sports among children and youth for character and nation-building. It is condemnable to see that BJP leaders have stopped to such a level that they are even politicizing it."The announcement prompted the BJP to equate it with the Muslim League's Direct Action Day, which began on that day in 1946. BJP Rajya Sabha lawmaker Swapan Dasgupta said that the Muslim League launched its Direct Action Day and began the Great Calcutta Killings in 1946 on August 16. "In today's West Bengal, Khela Hobe has come to symbolise a wave of terror attacks on opponents." he tweeted.Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari met Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar last week with several monks and urged him to request Banerjee to shift the date of Khela Hobe Divas as August 16 coincides with ‘Great Calcutta Killing’ of 1946. Following Adhikari’s request, Dhankhar had also appealed to the West Bengal chief minister to change the date."Expect righteous call @MamataOfficial over date of “Khela Hobe Diwas” Sanatan Sages apprehend that Aug 16’ also known as “1946 Calcutta Killings” as ‘Khela Hobe Diwas” would be grim reminder of worst communal killings of thousands on Jinnah call of ‘Direct Action Day’," Dhankhar tweeted. “Peace and harmony are vital to flourishing of democracy. All steps that have potential to generate divisiveness in society must be contained. Expect @MamataOfficial to rise over partisan stance and take urgent call as regards date #KhelaHobe with public interest in mind,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/west-bengal-to-celebrate-khela-hobe-divas-today-101629074430829.html

This is the first cabinet meeting of the state after Navjot Singh Sidhu took over as the president of the Congress party's Punjab unit.

The last meeting was held on June 18.Though the agenda of Monday’s cabinet meeting is yet to be revealed, news agency PTI reported last week that a new bill which seeks to earmark a part of Punjab’s annual budget for the welfare of Scheduled Castes (SCs) in proportion to their population in the state, is likely to be considered for approval.In July, chief minister Singh gave his approval for putting the ‘Punjab State Welfare and Development of Scheduled Castes (Planning, Earmarking and Utilization of Financial Resources) Sub-Allocation Bill, 2021’ before the state cabinet, to pave way for its enactment in the next session of the assembly, PTI further reported. The bill will enable the Punjab government to put in place an institutional mechanism to formulate and monitor the implementation of the Scheduled Caste Sub Plan (SCSP) and issues related to it.Hindustan Times earlier reported that the cabinet meeting will also see a discussion on bringing an ordinance for the establishment and incorporation of a private university coming up in Mohali along with deciding the date for convening the monsoon session of the assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cabinet-meeting-to-be-held-today-after-nearly-2-months-101629076050263.html
16-08-2021||Delhi||Police: Jatheri was diversifying gang’s operations||Says after arresting gangster Sandeep alias Kala Jatheri, the Delhi Police team interrogating the crime lord has learned that his gang, which was mostly involved in contract killings and extortions, was allegedly diversifying their illegal activities by teaming up with or taking over authorised and unauthorised liquor dealers and those involved in illegal mining in Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab to set up a bigger syndicate, which at present has nearly 200 members in north India and abroad.Jatheri’s female associate, Anuradha Chaudhary, who was arrested along with him from Saharanpur on July 30, was the alleged brains behind the gang’s diversification and was managing everything related to income, expenditures and investments, said Delhi Police special cell sleuths interrogating the two.Jatheri, who topped the list of the most wanted criminals of north India, was arrested on July 30 along with his female associate, Anuradha Chaudhary aka “Revolver Rani”, by the counter intelligence team of the special cell at a dhaba near Sarsawa toll plaza on the Saharanpur-Yamuna Nagar highway.He carried a reward of ₹7 lakh on his arrest, and was wanted in nearly 40 cases of dacoity, robbery, extortion and attempt to murder. A total of 15 of these cases were registered in Delhi, and the rest in Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan.The two are currently in police custody and are being interrogated to establish the crimes they or their gang members have committed since February 2020, when Jatheri escaped from the Haryana Police’s custody in Faridabad, after seven of his associates stormed the prison van carrying the gangster to Bhondsi Jail from the Faridabad court.The police said they were aware that Jatheri’s syndicate were primarily involved in contract killings and extorting money from businessmen after firing “warning shots” at business establishments or homes, followed by extortion calls or leaving threats on paper slips.Though some of his associates arrested in the recent past had hinted that the gang members had also joined hands with people involved in liquor trade, illegal mining and betting to establish more sources of money, police did not have a full picture till now.“Interrogation of Jatheri and his female partner has revealed that they were working on ways to control these businesses in Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab either through intimidation or by securing consent of the key players of the businesses... The two disclosed the names of their gang members and their business partners, who may be asked to join the investigation,” said another special cell officer, requesting not to be named.Police said the income that the group has been earning through extortion and other illegal activities is also transferred to Kala Rana, Goldy Brar and Monty -- who are based in Bangkok, Canada and Dubai, respectively -- to invest in their narcotic drugs business. “Jatheri is not directly involved in drug dealing but the money sent is remuneration for their assistance to his gang from abroad,” added the second officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/policejatheri-was-diversifying-gang-s-operations-101629076491340.html
16-08-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: She’s out of the closet||How could any man be so mean? Could Kate really bear Adam long enough to discover the gentleness he apparently possessed? More urgently, did Rakhshanda Jalil really care?Turns out the highbrow Ms Jalil devoured Adam’s Law with unadulterated pleasure. Now, decades later, the acclaimed author of 30 books outs herself as a devotee of Mills & Boon paperbacks.“Millsies were my escape into romance, travel, and new places,” Ms Jalil, 58, gushes in a voice not at all hoarse with passion, totally unlike the slushy Mills & Boon heroines. Here she pauses, and murmurs more softly—“I haven’t read a Millsie for 30 years.”This afternoon the writing room in her central Delhi home is dignified with classics by Urdu and English literary giants. Poet Ghalib’s portrait hangs on the wall. The room’s heirloom bookrack originally belonged to her legendary grandfather—Professor Aley Ahmad Suroor, poet and Urdu scholar in Aligarh Muslim University.And then there’s the elephant in the room—a row of tatty MBs, each as slim as its female protagonist.“I began reading the Millsies in my final year at school and read them all through BA and MA,”Ms Jalil discloses this side of her past with a slight smile playing enigmatically on her lips. She stayed loyal to the “Millsie” girls even while wading through Chaucers and Spensers in Delhi University’s Miranda House. Living with parents in Nizamuddin East in the early 1980s, the young “Rakshi” would daily walk to the neighbourhood market to borrow a Mills & Boon from the Bawa Lending Library. They charged 60 paise for each novel, plus extra if not returned within 24 hours. “So I would read each book at a gallop!” Subsequently she built a private collection of these romances. Her present-day stack shows creased covers bearing pretty damsels in a variety of situations—receiving a french kiss on one, getting embraced by a shirtless dandy on another. In many homes, such novels were hidden from mummy-papa. In Ms Jalil’s case, the mother herself handed her the first of the Mills & Boon. “Mummy rescued me from being an awfully earnest person. She was a librarian and thought it was important to read all kinds of things.”In time Ms Jalil grew out of these pulpy escapades. But by then she had been affected enough to walk down the aisle with her own handpicked TDH—the romance novel speak for a tall, dark, handsome man.Recently, she culled her library collection by giving away 500 books, but kept the romance stash. “Out of pure sentimental attachment,” Ms Jalil declares in coy defiance, her gaze possessively turning to the Millsies in her hands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-she-s-out-of-the-closet-101629076189083.html
16-08-2021||Delhi||In I-Day speech, CM salutes healthcare, frontline workers||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday announced the roll out of the Deshbhakti (patriotism) curriculum from September 27 in government-run schools in the city and Yoga programme at public parks and community halls on October 2. These programmes were mentioned in the Delhi budget 2021-22 presented by the Kejriwal government.In his Independence Day speech from the lawns of the Delhi Secretariat, Kejriwal further elaborated on Delhi’s experience with Covid-19 pandemic while appreciating the role of healthcare and frontline workers in fighting the pandemic. He also highlighted the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) efforts to enhance public welfare services and act as a role model for other states.“For the last 1.5 years, people are facing the brunt of the Covid-19 pandemic and a large number of doctors, paramedics and frontline workers have lost their lives. India has witnessed two waves of Covid-19. Delhi has witnessed four – in June 2020, September 2020, November 2020 and April 2021. The April wave in Delhi was the most dangerous. There will hardly be any family in Delhi which has not seen infection among relatives. So many of them lost their loved ones. It was an emotional phase for us. Our ministers, MLAs, officers worked 24x7 to save lives,” said Kejriwal in Sunday’s speech.At its peak, Delhi recorded more than 28,300 new Covid-19 cases in 24-hours on April 20 and a positivity rate of more than 36% on April 22. The Covid-19 surge left the city’s healthcare system overburdened, which was worsened by a severe crisis of oxygen, resulting in a high number of deaths.The chief minister further said, “I salute the doctors, nurses and paramedics who served us with utmost dedication. They are no less than a soldier. There was an existing Delhi government scheme to help martyred soldiers’ kin with ₹1 crore in financial assistance. We extended the same scheme to healthcare and frontline workers. Lives of people are priceless. This amount is the minimum token of gratitude for their service to the people of Delhi. Delhi government stands with the patients too.”“The children who have been orphaned are our children. We can’t abandon them. We have made a scheme for them too. We have also made a scheme for those who lost breadwinners,” said Kejriwal – referring to financial assistance schemes under which children orphaned by Covid-19 and households losing their primary breadwinners in Delhi are entitled to a monthly financial assistance of ₹2,500.Highlighting the AAP government’s role in the education sector, the chief minister said: “In 74 years, in schools of our country, we have taught physics, chemistry, maths, history but not patriotism. We assumed that students would learn that themselves. I am happy to announce such a curriculum in Delhi’s schools to encourage our students to take pride in the nation. This will be a completely activity-based programme to make children understand their roles and duties as a responsible citizen. Every child will be prepared to contribute to nation building and sacrifice everything for the nation. There is no better day to start the programme than Bhagat Singh’s birth anniversary. He had sacrificed his life for the nation at the age of 23. I also urge parents to discuss patriotism and responsibilities with children when they are home.” Bhagat Singh’s birth anniversary is on September 27.Kejriwal said he was happy to announce that the Delhi board of school education has signed a MoU (memorandum of agreement) with the international board to offer a much sought after and internationally recognised curriculum in the city schools.Kejriwal also claimed that Delhi had become a good governance laboratory under his party’s rule. He said his government recognised its responsibility to provide quality basic services including education, healthcare, water and electricity to residents and the AAP government’s model was now being adopted by other political outfits.“We are doing experiments on every aspect of governance. Recently we made the regional transport offices provide all services online—no queue, no crowd, no loss of working day, no touts. If one does not know how to use the internet, just call 1076. We started with the transport department. Slowly, we will provide all government services online. In recent years, we launched the doorstep delivery model – which has more than 150 services now. In schools we launched a happiness class aimed at meditation, positivity, encouragement. We launched entrepreneurship classes,” he said, naming a few initiatives of the government.Highlighting the importance of Yoga and meditation along with Gandhian values, Kejriwal said, “We have to make Yoga a part of people’s life. This year from October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we will launch a programme of Yoga classes in parks and community centres. We are training a large number of yoga instructors for the programme. If groups of residents of any colony ask us about instructors, we will help them under the programme.”He further spoke of his ambitions to bring Delhi’s per capita income at par with Singapore’s and bidding for the Olympics in 2048, promises made during the budget session of the assembly earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/in-i-day-speech-cm-salutes-healthcare-frontline-workers-101629074997999.html
16-08-2021||Delhi||The uniform serves even after duty ends||When Major General Ashim Kohli retired from the Indian Army in 2019, he had stacks of different kinds of service uniforms. While he wanted to keep a couple of them as remembrance, he wasn’t quite sure how he could dispose of the rest with the dignity they deserved. He talked to several fellow army officers, who retired before him and most, he realized, had boxes full of old uniforms with no idea what to do with them.On Republic Day this year, Kohli set up a non-profit that collects uniforms from defence forces and upcycles them into a range of products.“Some soldiers like to keep the uniforms intact along with the medals. Others cut it or burn it with a heavy heart to avoid any misuse. Our organization now collects old uniforms from defence personnel and produces masks, aprons, school bags, blankets, and a range of other products from them, which are donated to various army welfare organizations, and to the underprivileged sections of the society,” says Kohli, founder of Sewaj Neesim Foundation, who runs a website named ‘Vardi Ka Samman’, the core cause it espouses. In the past two months, it has collected over 5,000 old uniforms mostly from the retired and serving defence personnel.‘Sepoi’ -- a name from the word ‘sipahi’ meaning soldier--- is another such initiative. Founded in 2019 by Mumbai-based couple Siddharth and Suchi Jaiswal, it turns old defence uniforms into products such as backpacks, tote bags, and laptop bags. Siddharth says the year 2016 marked a turning point in their lives when they read a news about how terrorists involved in the Pathankot attack disguised themselves in Army uniforms.“That is when we realised how old Army uniforms could fall into wrong hands and be used for illegal and even terrorist activities. When I did more research on the subject, I realized that a lot of old, worn-out uniforms end up in the scrap market,” says Siddharth. “I thought if we could repurpose them, we would not only prevent their illegal use but also reduce waste and provide employment to many while maintaining their dignity.”The Indian Army officers use about eight types of uniforms for different occasions during winter and summer, which include general duty uniforms, blue patrol, 6 Alpha/ 6 Bravo, combat uniform, dungarees, smocks. The veterans tell you how their uniforms—with their various insignia, accoutrements, badges of rank, and lanyards of their regiments—represent pride, honour and their very identity as soldiers.The question of the disposal of uniforms in a dignified manner, they say, has bothered them for decades. The Indian army spokesperson declined to comment on whether the Army has any internal mechanism for disposal of old uniforms.“I have 26 sets of uniforms, which were like my second skin, and I cannot express my emotional attachment to them. I cannot dispose them like other old clothes. I feel recycling them is a good solution,” said Lieutenant General R S Salaria, who retired from service in March last year.“Thousands of defence personnel retire every year and it is up to them to decide what they want to do with the uniforms. Even I had 24 uniforms, which I had to shred and dispose most of them. I felt bad but did not have a choice,” said Captain Anoop Vij, who retired from the Indian Navy in 2019.Kohli’s organisation outsources upcycling work to various NGOs. “We are distributing all the products made from these uniforms to army-welfare organizations, orphanages, old-age homes, among others. The idea is to give back to the army and the society,” said Kohli.Sepoi, Siddharth says, shares up to 15% of its profits with various NGOs working for the welfare of women. He sells handcrafted products, designed by professional designers, through Sepoi’s website and other e-commerce platforms. “When we started, we thought that most of our customers would be civilians. Today, 60% of our products are being purchased by those who are in the army or have their relatives in the army,” he said.Interestingly, the bags Sepoi makes has a card or a printed piece of paper with a story about the uniform and the soldier who wore it. “We do not collect old uniforms randomly, but ones whose wearer can tell his or her story. The idea is to educate people about the values, valour and selfless service by the veterans to our country and to enhance the civilian-military understanding,” said Jaiswal.Sepoi’s signature collection combines cloth from old army uniforms and fresh leather to produce fashionable bags. “ I add leather to ensure that our products look premium and competitive in the market. They are high on patriotism and style,” says Jaiswal.Sachin (who uses only his first name), a designer and production head at Swatric--a Delhi-based firm that is currently upcycling old defence uniforms for Sewaj Neesim Foundation--said the fabric used in the army uniform has a twill weave construction, which makes it very sturdy and suitable for making different products.“But making flat fabric from old defence uniform is quite a challenge as these have several tags, buttons, pockets on the base fabric. After making the flat fabric, we send it for washing,” said Sachin. “We can make one school bag or 15 masks from a uniform. I cannot explain the joy of turning these old army uniforms into other useful products. I feel I am doing my bit in helping save the environment and the dignity of the old army uniforms, ” said Sachin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/the-uniform-serves-even-after-duty-ends-101629073899390.html
16-08-2021||Delhi||Winged guests make an early entrance at Delhi zoo||This monsoon, the Delhi zoo has an early winged visitor which usually arrives from eastern parts of the country around mid-August.“This year, painted storks were spotted here as early as on August 6. The numbers have been growing since... Usually they are seen arriving from eastern parts of the country by mid or late August. The zoo is one of the few places in Delhi where painted storks nest and breed, which is one of the major factors for the zoo to be considered a birding spot,” said Ramesh Kumar Pandey, Delhi zoo director.Almost 140 painted storks have already arrived, zoo officials said, adding that the water bodies in the zoo are full of the winged creatures with long, yellow beaks. “By the end of August, the numbers may reach more than 500,” said Pandey.With the season for migratory birds just beginning, the zoo authorities plan to organise guided birdwatching tours for students and bird enthusiasts over the coming weeks.“We plan to organise the first guided trip over the coming week when there will be more number of birds. It will be organised on a day when the zoo is closed for visitors. Initially, we plan to have a group of 20 bird watchers. We will hand over a pair of binoculars to the participants and lead the tour,” said Pandey.According to zoo officials, August to October is the peak breeding season for the painted storks which stay here till March before flying away with their chicks.“A structured bird-watching tour can be good learning for bird enthusiasts as well as students. The zoo does have a good diversity of bird species and could emerge as one of the many birdwatching sites for birders in Delhi,” said Pankaj Gupta, a birder.The zoo has at least 50 kinds of free-ranging avian species most part of the year including herons, white-breasted kingfisher, cormorants, parakeets, yellow-footed green pigeon, brown-headed barbet, black ibis, grey hornbill, jungle babbler and spot-billed ducks.According to a research paper titled “Breeding patterns of painted storks at Delhi zoo” authored by Abdul J Urfi, from school of environmental sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, the Delhi zoo has been an important breeding site for the painted stork since 1960. “Most nesting occurred in mesquite trees (Prosopis juliflora) on islands in the ponds at the Zoo. The breeding season begins in late August. This zoo site may be the only nesting colony site for the painted stork in the Delhi region,” it stated.Birders said that though the painted stork, a wetland bird, is found in many marshes and green patches in Delhi, they have been found nesting only at the Delhi zoo.Close to Delhi’s border, the Sultanpur National Park, essentially a bird sanctuary on the Gurugram-Jhajjar highway, is also known for a huge nesting colony of painted storks. “The painted storks have been spotted there as well,” said Gupta.The Delhi zoo opened on August 1, more than two months after it was shut during the second wave of the pandemic.The Delhi zoo was shut for visitors on March 18 last year, a week before the nationwide lockdown was imposed, and was followed by the avian flu in January this year.The zoo had finally reopened on April 1 this year, only to be closed again on April 15, as the second wave of the pandemic struck the nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/winged-guests-make-an-early-entrance-at-delhi-zoo-101629069170253.html
16-08-2021||Delhi||Paucity of land hits compensatory afforestation plan||With several large-scale development projects requiring “diversion of deemed forests”, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is finding it difficult to make available non-forest land for compensatory afforestation (CA) in the Capital and is currently exploring if such land can be provided in neighbouring states.DDA officials said that for diversion of deemed forests -- process by which the land is reclassified for non-forest purposes -- equivalent non-forest land has to be provided for CA.Of the requests for 136 hectares of non-forest land for CA in the past one year, DDA officials said they have only been able to provide nearly 116 hectares. “The green cover in Delhi is 23% and most of the spaces earmarked as green are saturated. It is difficult to find large land parcels for CA,” said Rajeev Kumar Tiwari, principal commissioner, DDA.Due to paucity of land, the land-owning agency is now exploring if such land can be provided in neighbouring states for proposed central government projects in Delhi.In May this year, the DDA wrote to the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change seeking clarity on the issue, following which the ministry’s forest advisory committee (FAC), which discussed the matter in June end, has asked Delhi authorities to provide additional information about their plan for the Capital’s green cover.“The FAC has been conscious that any relaxation in the compensatory afforestation norms will ultimately lead to reduction in forest cover of Delhi which is not desirable...,” as per the minutes of the meeting.DDA officials said that they are yet to get an official communication in this regard.“Delhi is largely urbanised. Most of the areas identified as recreational green under the Master Plan have already been used either as parks or for plantation. So, availability of Master plan green areas for the purpose of CA are now very limited,” said an official, who did not wish to be named. Another DDA official said the limited vacant land parcels available in Delhi also need to be reserved for planning public utilities.DDA’s plan has also been opposed by many. “This is an ecologically flawed idea. The move, if allowed, will defeat the purpose of compensatory afforestation,” said Vijay Dhasmana, ecologist and curator of Aravalli Biodiversity Park, Gurugram.A DDA official said that with Yamuna rejuvenation work going on at a fast pace, “most of the floodplain area has already been committed to the compensatory plantation requirement of various agencies”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/paucity-of-land-hits-compensatory-afforestation-plan-101629068638201.html
16-08-2021||Delhi||Tales of settlement, displacement from village that came up in forest||In the early 1980s, Mohammad Saleem Khan migrated from Gaya in Bihar to the fledging edges of the national capital. A teenager, Khan found work at a bauxite mine in the forests of the Aravalli hills in Faridabad. For a few months, he commuted to the mining site from a local village but later asked his contractor, a local strongman, for a hut near the mine.“The contractor asked me to return the next day with every penny I had saved. When I brought the money, he pointed to a small cluster of huts and asked me to set up my hut next to it. He said I didn’t need to worry about any other permission or document,” said Khan, now in his early 60s.He remembers giving away some ₹500-700 at the time. Some of the other 2,000-odd labourers at the mine did the same. They had no electricity connection but three local wells served water to the residents there.As the mine grew, more labourers surrendered their life savings to contractors in return for tiny parcels of land and protection. The local strongmen, who were paid off, promised that they’d prevent eviction.Khan recalled how the contractors would demarcate land. “They would simply throw a stone and claim ownership of the land up to the point where the stone fell,” he said. At the time, most of these Aravalli foothills was forestland.Of course, without authorised papers, no one could sell property or land – not legally, anyway. “Till the end, most sale deeds remained primitive in nature and had no legal standing. Property dealers would make the sales on plain pieces of paper, in front of their own four local witnesses. The land sold would be mentioned as a garbage dump yard. People were getting land for cheap, and everyone was happy,” said a local resident who didn’t want to be identified.Over the next three decades, this tiny cluster of huts transformed into a large village comprising thousands of brick houses perched on the Aravalli hills on the southern fringes of Delhi.Khori, a village of dusty narrow streets, cramped houses in the middle of a forest clearing, vaulted into the news on June 7, when the Supreme Court ordered all illegal encroachment on forest land in the area to be cleared within six weeks.Days later, 3,000 policemen arrived at the village. By June 12, electricity connections were cut and water tankers stopped from entering the village. Demolitions began on July 17.In June, the government estimated around 5,100 houses and 10,000 residents lived in Khori. unofficial estimates put the number between 30,000 and 50,000. Today, only a handful of structures remain, and most residents have relocated.Prime locationBauxite mining was first banned in the Aravallis in 1992, according to locals and activists. By then, there were already around 200-300 huts in the mines, and more were on the way, courtesy the proximity of the location to Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.Mining continued sporadically till the Supreme Court issued a blanket ban in 2009, but the migrants – who were bringing their relatives from the hinterlands of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar – easily found other jobs.“By 1998 or so, there were some 600 houses in this colony. It had taken the shape of a proper kachchi (unauthorised) colony. No one bothered to take action and the strongmen and property dealers had patronage of the politicians,” said Jitender Bhadana, who runs an NGO, Save Aravalli Trust, and has been fighting to restore the Aravalli forests.In 1998, the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad moved to clear the encroachment – the first time since Khori came up in the early 1980s – but the demolitions stopped after a few dozen houses, said residents. “It was the first time I feared that there was something illegal in the land I had paid my life savings for,” said Khan, a former president of the Khori Residents Welfare Association.Months later, some residents of the village, who were surviving on stealing from power lines and water tankers, got limited electricity and water connections. “The municipal corporation provided legal electricity connection to some 300 houses and permitted the digging of six borewells”, said Veer Shankar Singh, a resident.Current MCF commissioner Yashpal Yadav did not respond to requests for a comment. His predecessor, Garima Mittal, who was in-charge during the demolition drive, refused to comment saying she has been transferred.Seema Trikha, Bharatiya Janata Party MLA from Badhkal, under which Khori falls, blamed the “mafia of old times” who were “protected” by the (earlier) governments for allowing the illegal occupancy of the forest land.“We have neither been involved in inviting buyers to this land, nor in selling any land in the forest area,” said Trikha.Mahendra Pratap Singh, who served as the MLA of the area (it fell under Mewla Maharajpur constituency until 2004) five times between 1982 and 2014, said that it was wrong to blame any one party or government.“But for the Supreme Court order, the BJP too was allowing the encroachment to continue. It is just that the poor began living on that land and none of the governments bothered to evict them,” said the five-time MLA from the Congress.Rapid encroachmentBy the early 2000s, Khori was thriving and large chunks of the forest on the hillocks had given way to residential plots. Some families sold their ancestral properties to buy land.Mohammad Idris, a 65-year-old tailor, said nine members of his family moved to the village in 2001 after selling his property in UP’s Badaun. “Seven immediate and extended family members of mine followed me over the next decade to sell their ancestral properties and buy land here,” said Idris.Idris and others were told by local touts that Khori, which was technically in Haryana, fell on the Delhi side of the border.Adjacent to Khori is the Lal Kuan village, which falls on the Delhi side of the border. A rusting iron fence marks the border, but the demarcation is visible in only a few stretches. “The builders took advantage of this fact. They sold land to the people saying the Delhi government would eventually regularise the illegal colonies,” said Ishita Chatterjee, a PhD scholar studying the settlement. In the 2000s, the government in Delhi did regularise several low-income unauthorised colonies, giving hope to Khori residents.Sube Singh, the spokesperson of Faridabad Police, said property dealers lured buyers. “To those buying land near the Delhi border, they sold the land saying it fell in Delhi jurisdiction,” said Singh. “The property dealers had strong backing financially and politically, As for the residents, they just followed each other,” Singh added.Some residents who refuse to leave the now-demolished village continue to believe that they are Delhi residents. “I have been voting in Delhi all these years. My children are enrolled in a school in Delhi. What more evidence do you want?” asked Rama Devi, a woman who has set up a tent next to the rubble of her home.Buyers were assured that a property in Delhi meant better access to electricity and water. But on the ground, electricity and water connections were arranged by a network of local strongmen and touts who divided the village among themselves.“The mafia would get commercial electricity metres installed in private homes in Lal Kuan, and then pull illegal connections from there to our homes in Khori,” said Singh.Khori residents eventually ended up paying as much as ₹14 per unit of electricity – the rate in Delhi is between ₹2 and ₹8 and Haryana ₹2 and ₹7 --- and a few relied on stolen connections from Haryana side.Water was sold in tankers for ₹800-900 per 4,000 litres to those who didn’t have access to the six borewells, residents said.A large number of Khori residents got documents made to show they were residents of Delhi.The power of attorney was not only the preferred residential document, but also the only choice. “Residents did some ‘setting’. To execute a power of attorney deal, the property owner would find someone from the village itself to pass him off as the actual owner,” said Singh.Chatterjee said the power of attorney documents wouldn’t stand the scrutiny of courts.Similarly, many residents went on to procure voter identity, ration cards, gas connections and even Aadhaar cards -- most of them on Khori addresses.Chatterjee said this was facilitated by property dealers, which included local residents.Demolition worriesBetween 1998 and 2021, the municipal corporation moved at least five times to demolish houses but since 2010, the Khori Residents Welfare Association got judicial relief. Assisting the petitioners was Nirmal Gorana, general secretary of Bandhua Mukti Morcha. “We are not against the SC order. Our fight is for the rehabilitation of tens of thousands of people being displaced,” said Gorana.Residents believed that the government would never displace thousands of people. Thus, buying and selling of property continued unabated. Until the SC order, a single storey house constructed on a 50 square yard in Khori could cost as high as ₹20 lakh.When the court order came in June, it sparked immediate protests. The police booked over 550 known and unknown persons and arrested about 20 of them.Chetan Agarwal, an independent forest analyst, said the forest had a huge environmental value for the national capital region, but added that the human cost of the demolition was also too high.Many residents have been forced to opt for rented accommodation in the surrounding neighbourhoods – Lakkarpur in Faridabad being the closest.“I had to pay ₹4,000 as rent for a room which usually costs ₹2,000 in Lakkarpur village. Tenants are charging Khori residents double and triple of the usual rates and then treating us like beggars,” said Mohammad Saleem, a painter.A few have stayed back, pitching tents amid the rubble. “Who do we trust now? All these years, politicians and officials kept assuring us that our homes were safe. Now, we have lost everything,” said Gendo Devi, a resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tales-of-settlement-displacement-from-village-that-came-up-in-forest-101629067273651.html

16-08-2021||Other||Covid-19 surge continues to rage in Kerala, TPR at 15.11%||Kerala on Sunday reported 18,582 fresh Covid-19 cases with a high test positivity rate (TPR) of 15.11% after 122, 970 samples were tested, said the state health ministry. Amid high cases the recovery rate however surpassed fresh cases in last five days. On Sunday, 20,089 people recovered. Experts said this is a good sign. “The government and people should be very careful during the Onam festivities. Another spike will land the state in a difficult situation,” warned internal medicine expert Dr NM Arun, who has been following the case trajectory closely. The state also reported 102 deaths and with this toll has gone up to 18,601. Four districts reported more than 2000 cases -- Malappuram 2681, Thrissur 2423, Kozhikode 2368 and Ernakulam 2161 cases. Active caseload is 1,78, 630, statistics show. The ICU occupancy in both private and government hospitals in the state is 2011 and the number of people on ventilators is 790. Hospitalisation of those who are with moderate or severe infections stands stabilised at 28,290. Among total hospitalisations, daily admission is between 10 and 15 per cent. Recovery is also stable so many hospitals are not flooded, health ministry records show. Meanwhile, the state administered around 500,000 vaccines for the second consecutive day. So far it administered 2,39,22,416 doses -- 1,72,66,344 people have govt first dose and 66,56,082 both doses till Saturday). The state has launched a campaign on Saturday to cover all people above 60 years at least one dose of the vaccine. According to the last sero survey, at least 45% of population are not exposed to antibodies and susceptible to infection. Union health minister M Mandaviya is reaching the state on Monday to review the situation. Minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan said the state’s high caseload is a serious concern for the union government. “The state is paying price for ignoring repeated warnings of the union government. We have been insisting institutional quarantine from the beginning itself. But the government opted for home quarantine but records show it flopped,” said the minister. The state is reporting more than 60% of the daily cases of the country for almost a month. The central team which visited eight worst-affected districts in the first week of August also flagged the state over lax home quarantine. It found serious flaws in protocols in home isolation. In districts like Malappuram and Kozhikode family size is big and infected easily passes the virus to other inmates. Though home isolation calls for strict procedure like infected should have a separate washroom and nobody should be allowed to enter the quarantined room but the team found that these measures were never met. This led to increased transmission within homes and formation of small clusters. Fearing another spike the government has tightened restrictions during the ongoing Onam festivities; mass gatherings, public meeting, community feasts and other functions were banned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-surge-continues-to-rage-in-kerala-tpr-at-1511-101629054021336.html

One of the youths succumbed to injuries on Sunday.According to Dindoshi police officers, Armaan Khan, 29, and his friend Asif Shaikh were sitting near their house at Gokuldham around 1.30am on Wednesday when one of the accused, Abhi Pawar, approached them and threatened that he would seek revenge from Khan over a previous enmity. The two men then left the spot. However, the next day, when the duo was near the Dambar Company compound at Malad (East), Pawar, his mother Nagubai, 47, and father Margappa, 48, reached the spot and began abusing Khan. When Khan confronted them, Pawar called his three friends who were nearby and started assaulting the victims. Pawar then picked up a sickle and attacked Shaikh on his head. Margappa, too, assaulted Shaikh with a bamboo stick, injuring his head. Pawar then attacked Khan in his stomach, shoulders and hands.The other accused – Akash Pawar, Hussain Khan and an unidentified person – also began assaulting Khan and Pawar stabbed him with a chopper. The six then fled the spot. Some locals rushed the two to a hospital and they were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). On Sunday, after Khan died, Dindoshi police arrested Pawar, his parents, Akash and Hussain on murder and attempt to murder charges. “We are on the lookout for the sixth, who is absconding,” said an officer from Dindoshi police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/5-held-for-killing-youth-assaulting-his-friend-in-mumbai-101629053601320.html

On Independence Day, Thackeray, in a post on Facebook, said that in the past seven decades, the country has seen progress, but it has not been uniform in all the states, leading to an unbalanced growth that has created other issues for the country.The MNS is known for its tirade and violence against North Indians that started in February 2008.In an indirect reference to the caste politics and unease over the demand for quotas for Marathas and Other Backward Classes (OBCs), Thackeray said that the dreams of the youth must not fall victims to such hatred. “The dreams of this young generation should not become victims of the hateful propaganda going on at all levels in the country and in our state. On the contrary, one must create an atmosphere that will empower them to stand against the rulers who spread social hatred and raise the slogan of ‘Satyamev Jayate’,” he said.Thackeray, in the social media post, said that since independence, the country has made “spectacular progress” in various fields. “[But] have all the states benefitted from this growth? Unfortunately, the answer is no. The unbalanced growth and development has created several issues for the country. Massive rise in population, challenges in the agriculture sector, stress on industries, service sector, lack of coordination between education and job opportunities and the issue of migration — for all these issues, we need solutions, by keeping the country first,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/time-to-save-young-generation-from-power-hungry-people-raj-thackeray-in-mumbai-101629053480700.html
16-08-2021||Mumbai||No illegality in husband having intercourse with his wife against her wish: Mumbai court||There is nothing illegal about husband having sexual intercourse with his wife against her wish, the sessions court said on Friday, while granting anticipatory bail to a Wadala resident booked on a complaint of ill-treatment by his wife.The woman in her complaint said she got married to the Wadala resident last November and her husband and in-laws started imposing restrictions on her immediately after the marriage. She alleged that they demanded money and ill-treated her for failing to meet the demand.The woman further alleged that a month after the marriage, her husband had intercourse with her against her wish. She said he again forced himself upon her when they went to Mahabaleshwar in January and thereafter, she fell ill. She added that on returning from Mahabaleshwar when she went to a doctor, she was informed that she had suffered paralysis below the waist.After her complaint, Wadala TT police booked the man, his brother and brother’s wife, sister and her husband under sections 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (2) (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.All the accused had then moved the sessions court for anticipatory bail, claiming that there was no demand for money nor was any harassment meted out to the complainant and that they were falsely implicated.The accused also pointed out that his sister stayed at Ratnagiri and had visited his house for two days when his wife was around.Though the police opposed the bail pleas, additional sessions judge Sanjashree Gharat granted relief to the five accused on furnishing a personal bond of ₹15,000 each with one or two sureties of the same amount.With regards to the woman’s allegation of forcible intercourse, the court said that there was nothing illegal in a husband having intercourse with his wife against her wish. “Applicant no 1 (husband) cannot be said to have committed any illegal thing,” the court said about the allegation. “It is very unfortunate that the young girl suffered from paralysis. However, the applicants cannot be held responsible for the same,” the court added.The judge, on the allegation of dowry demand, said that the woman had claimed that she was ill-treated at her matrimonial home for non-payment of money demanded by her husband and in-laws, but nowhere specified as to how much money was demanded.When asked whether she agreed with the order passed by the sessions judge, advocate Kalpana Hiray, the additional public prosecutor who represented the police, said she would have to refer to the order before commenting on it.However, the sessions court order does not reflect the opinion of the Supreme Court (SC) which had observed that in a marriage a man and woman are equals and the woman has a right to privacy as well. In a judgment on the issue, SC observed, “Even a woman of easy virtue is entitled to privacy and no one can invade her privacy as and when he likes. So also, it is not open to any and every person to violate her person as and when he wishes. She is entitled to protect her person if there is an attempt to violate it against her wish. She is equally entitled to the protection of law.”Justice JB Pardiwala of Gujarat high court, while passing judgment in a case, had observed, “A woman is no longer the chattel-antiquated practices labelled her to be. A husband who has intercourse with his wife is not using a property, he’s fulfilling a marital consortium with a fellow human being with dignity equal to that he accords himself. He can’t be permitted to violate this dignity by coercing her to engage in a sexual act without her free consent.”While speaking on the issue of marital rape, advocate Aniket Nikam, said, “Today, section 375 (rape) of the IPC needs amendment to the exception which is already suggested by the justice JS Verma committee set up for providing sharper teeth to anti-rape laws. Every woman is a separate individual and the age-old reluctance (exception) can’t be applied every time. But this amendment needs to come up with safeguards to ensure that the new law won’t be misused.”Nikam said, “We’ve borrowed this [law] from the British Common law when women were considered as chattels who lacked decision-making powers. But today they need to be treated as an equal, and individual rights need to be considered. However, we also need to keep in mind that marriage as an institution should not suffer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-illegality-in-husband-having-intercourse-with-his-wife-against-her-wish-mumbai-court-101629053061774.html
16-08-2021||Mumbai||Faculty recruitment: Lack of clarity a hurdle in implementing social, economical quota in IITs, say experts||Lack of clarity on how to implement social and economical reservations in a flexible cadre system and disruption to natural career progression path are hurdles that Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) face in implementing social and economical reservations in their faculty positions. The Government of India mandates a reservation of 10% for candidates belonging to the economically weaker sections (EWS), 27% from other backward classes (OBC) category, 15% for Scheduled Caste (SC) category and 7.5% for Scheduled Tribe (ST) category and 5% for candidates with physical disabilities. However, data accessed under the Right to Information (RTI) Act shows that IITs have fared poorly in implementing these reservation norms in their faculty recruitment.Until 2019 these reservations were applicable at the entry-level — assistant professor— positions. Thereafter the rules were extended to all other positions— associate and full professor positions. Despite these policies, HT had earlier reported, 22 of all the 23 IITs don’t have more than six teachers from the ST community. Eighteen of them have 10 or less candidates from the SC category on their faculty rolls and seven IITs had 10 or fewer faculty from the OBC category. Data for IIT Mandi was unavailable. “It is a difficult task to implement reservations in the flexi cadre system where the total number of positions are not fixed. IITs have the liberty to promote or hire any world-class faculty,” said the director of an IIT, on the condition of anonymity. IITs follow a flexible cadre system for the appointment of faculty. The sanctioned strength of faculty at different grades such as professor, associate professor and an assistant professor is not fixed. Without a fixed strength, applying reservations is a concern.“IITs and other Centrally Funded Technical Institutes (CFTIs) are asking the Ministry of Education (MoE) for providing guidelines for making a reservation roster in a flexible cadre structure... The IITs are taking advantage of this flexible cadre for avoiding the faculty reservation,” said Rajesh Paswan, an associate professor and convener, Joint Forum for Academic and Social Justice. The director of a premier IIT, on the condition of anonymity, said that it will soon ask its board of governors to intervene and issue guidelines on how to apply reservations in a flexi cadre roster.“Another problem with economic reservations like EWS is that the criteria are that the gross annual family income should not exceed ₹8 lakh. While this can be implemented at the entry-level, for associates and professors the family’s income exceeds ₹8 lakh because the candidates have themselves been working. This is a problem while looking for candidates who fit the criteria,” said a senior official of another IIT.Another said that without clear guidance from the central government, implementing the reservation policies will deter the natural career progression path.“If followed to the letter, our current assistant/associate professors in general category will be denied promotion once the roster quota is full, and will have to wait for long periods, as opposed to the current system where promotion is based on merit, post completion of experience requirements,” he said.In April last year, an eight-member committee formed by the MoE to suggest measures to better implement reservations in admission and faculty selection, recommended that IITs should be exempted from caste reservations for faculty appointments as they are institutes of national importance. V Ramgopal Rao, director of IIT Delhi, who headed the committee, declined to comment.Apart from this, the committee had also highlighted the need to increase the talent pool in PhD so that they can be hired by IITs. It has recommended a one-year pre-PhD programme where aspirants get to spend a year with a researcher before getting admission to PhD.Paswan said, “It appears that the instructions issued by MoE to date are insufficient to ensure the effective implementation of faculty reservation in IITs and other CFTIs. Therefore, MoE should either immediately abolish the flexible faculty cadre structure in IITs and other CFTIs or should issue clear cut guidelines for making reservation rosters in the flexible faculty cadre structure. Since the teaching posts being currently filled by IITs are actually those which should be earmarked to SC/ST/OBC according to the Act and law, the ongoing faculty recruitment in IITs should also be stopped till such guidelines for the rosters are issued.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/faculty-recruitment-lack-of-clarity-a-hurdle-in-implementing-social-economical-quota-in-iits-say-experts-101629052461495.html

Yesterday, her condition deteriorated at home and we took her to hospital. Today, in the evening, she passed away. She had cirrhosis of the liver and because of that, many complications arose and she had a multiple organ failure," her elder brother Ranjith Lall told PTI over phone.Her last rites will be performed on Monday.Last year, in an interview to PTI, Sabrina had spoken about her plans to start a foundation in memory of her sister to aid women in similar situations to get justice.She had said that she has forgiven her sister's killer, Manu Sharma, who walked out of jail last year after the Delhi Sentence Review Board recommended his premature release.Siddharth Vashisht, better known as Manu Sharma, was serving life sentence in Tihar Jail here for the 1999 murder."I really do not have anything to say. I am not feeling anything. I feel numb. The only thing I hope and pray to God is that he never thinks of repeating that mistake again," Sabrina had told PTI.She had in 2018 written to the jail authorities that she had no objection to Sharma's release.Jessica Lall was murdered in 1999 at a upscale restaurant in the national capital.Calling Jessica her closest friend, Sabrina had said she missed her sister's presence in her life every day."She was jovial and positive in life. It is not just birthdays and death anniversaries that I miss her, it is every day. I have lots of pictures of hers in my home and not that I need them to miss her, but they are there to remind me of her," Sabrina had told PTI.A film, 'No One Killed Jessica', was made on Sabrina's fight for getting justice for her sister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/jessica-lall-s-sister-sabrina-dies-battling-liver-cirrhosis-101629051111414.html

One year later, the teenager is yet to visit the campus. His second-year lessons, like his first-year, are slated to begin Monday online.“When I got admitted to the college, I was looking forward to visit the campus because it is one of the best colleges in the country. I was expecting some exposure and development but nothing like that has happened. There has been no intellectual growth since graduating school. We have been hearing that classes might resume in offline mode soon in the university. If that doesn’t happen, another year will be wasted,” said Kumar, 18.Several other DU students that HT spoke to expressed similar concerns. Classes for second-year UG students are set to begin from Monday in online mode. Universities and colleges in the capital have been closed since March last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Several stakeholders, including teachers and educationists have expressed concerns over the learning deficits that will arise due to prolonged closure of colleges.Harjeet Kaur Bhatia, former head of department of educational studies at Jamia Millia Islamia’s Faculty of Education, said, “No doubt there will be learning deficits along with emotional and social gaps. Many students do not have access to online learning and access does not just mean devices but also the ability to understand the texts. Students may be able to access certain texts but may not necessarily understand it. A blended mode of learning can be considered for students under which a small number of students could be allowed to visit campus after consulting all stakeholders and connect with teachers and peers.”A few DU principals have also held meetings with their staff to discuss how to proceed this academic year. Bijayalaxmi Nanda, principal of Miranda House, said, “During an academic committee meeting with teachers, we decided that at least partially vaccinated students can come to college for assistance and access the library after taking due permission. We have also been conducting tutorials in open-air areas. If we have a sizeable number of vaccinated students ask for lab access, that too might be arranged. Focus will also be on peer mentoring, providing more detailed lesson plans for the semester so that students know where they are going in the courses, and even greater internet support for teachers on campus.”Several teachers said that adapting the second-year syllabus for the online module helped them prepare for this session as well. Ashok (first name), who teaches Physics at Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma college in south campus, said students faced issues last year while following science experiments in virtual laboratories.“We have been recording videos of teachers performing experiments in college laboratories and sharing with the students. We had adapted the second-year syllabus last year for the then second-year students and the same will be used this year. There is only so much we can do due to the limitation of the online mode. Classroom teaching cannot be replaced with online learning,” he said.Tanvir Aeijaz, who teaches Political Science in Ramjas College, and is also the general secretary of the college staff council, called for holding offline classes once or twice a week for those students who are not able to attend online classes. “During a staff council meeting, we came to a conclusion that there should be a concerted effort to include students who are being excluded from the online teaching-learning process. Even those who are able to attend online classes are facing obstructions due to issues like poor connectivity, lack of internet services, home-based study, and lack of access to university facilities like libraries. Online libraries require a lot of internet data which might not be feasible for all.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/another-year-away-from-campus-for-du-s-second-year-undergraduate-students-101629051740706.html
16-08-2021||Other||Focus on civic literacy, social problems in Delhi govt’s deshbhakti curriculum||New Delhi: Love and respect for the country, tolerance for differences, contribution towards nation-building, and developing value system by introspection rather than coercion – these are among the topics addressed by the newly-launched deshbhakti curriculum which will be launched in government schools in the Capital next month.“Starting from September 27, the birth anniversary of Shaheed-e-Azam Bhagat Singh, Deshbhakti Curriculum will be taught daily for 45 minutes in government schools to students from nursery to class 8. We will instil a sense of pride and love towards the country in our children through the curriculum,” said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday.The curriculum, which has been developed into different stages for classes from nursery to class 8, saw the involvement of 41 mentor teachers, nine NGO partners and experts who played a significant role in the pilot run conducted between June and July.Anju Rohilla, former mentor teacher who was involved in the pilot project, said, “After the pilot run, my students gave me feedback that they had not thought about patriotism in so much detail before these classes. They knew that they love the country but through questions like what do they love about the country and its people, they delved deeper into the concept of patriotism. Through the course of conversation, children started introspecting why some people in the country were fighting or mocking each other if they indeed were patriotic and loved their people.”According to the curriculum framework released by the government on Saturday, a copy of which is with HT, the curriculum builds on interdisciplinary themes of civic literacy, environmental literacy, and global awareness. “Several successful education systems around the world, including countries like Singapore, Japan, Canada, and Australia, have adapted curricula aimed at instilling feelings of pride and responsibility towards the country, building an understanding of democratic values, civic education and citizen engagement and participation to resolve current and future challenges,” it stated.“Deshbhakti curriculum actively seeks to build a sense of belongingness, ownership and responsibility towards the nation amongst students, which would also inspire them to make necessary sacrifices for the country. These values are sought to be developed in students by facilitating critical and creative thinking skills rather than by coercion,” the document stated.The curriculum would cover three broad themes – knowledge of constitutional values, history of freedom struggle, Indian achievements, social problems and inequalities; values like honesty, loyalty, love for the country, sacrifice, and empathy; and behaviour involving scientific reasoning and mindset, standing up against injustice, respect for national symbols, and pluralism, among others.Like the previous two curricula – Happiness and Entrepreneurship Mindset – introduced by the Delhi government, there will be no textbooks or formal assessment system for the Deshbhakti Curriculum and teachers will be given a handbook comprising the different themes and a list of activities to be covered in the classes. The new curriculum also shares several learning outcomes – including problem-solving, self-awareness, self-confidence, and collaboration – like the previous two curricula.Arti Qanungo, who was involved in the curriculum’s content development team, said, “We have included true stories and incidents to help students understand that helping someone needy, avoiding wastage of water, not destroying monuments, planting trees, is also ‘deshbhakti’.”During the pilot runs, teachers said, they focused on instances like making videos of those injured in a road accident as prompts to initiate discussion in class. “After describing the incident, we asked students if they should help the injured or walk away after sharing the video on social media. This helps children introspect. While talking about wastage of food, we urge students to think about where the food comes from and think of farmers who grow them. This way we make them more mindful of the contribution of farmers towards nation-building,” Qanungo said.Poonam Batra, professor of Education at Delhi University, said, “Ideas of patriotism are embedded in our constitutional values of democracy, fraternity, liberty, equality and justice. These can be taught to children by ensuring that they have lived experiences of these values in schools and classrooms instead of teaching them through definitions and sermons. The current political climate encourages a rhetorical view of patriotism and nationalism that is not only narrow but one that glosses over core Constitutional commitments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/focus-on-civic-literacy-social-problems-in-delhi-government-s-deshbhakti-curriculum-101629051622197.html

The officer said just as Dahiya climbed the flyover, a kite string got entangled in his throat, slitting it.Dahiya stopped the bike, and was bleeding profusely. Bystanders rushed him to the nearby Saroj Hospital, where the doctors declared him brought dead.The officer said that a case has been registered against unknown persons and the police were trying to trace who was using the banned string that killed Dahiya.Like the past few years, this time too, ahead of the Independence Day, the Delhi Police issued an order under Section 144 of the CrPC, 1973, banning the sale, use, and purchase of Chinese kite string.The National Green Tribunal in 2017 imposed a nationwide ban on the use of Chinese glass-coated string (manjha) for flying kites, saying it poses a life risk to humans, animals, and birds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhiman-on-bike-dies-after-banned-manjha-slits-his-throat-101629051441674.html
16-08-2021||Delhi||Staggered sessions as Delhi schools reopen for classes 10,12||A week after the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) allowed schools in the Capital to restart physical classes for students of classes 10 and 12, most public and private schools will begin in-person classes in a staggered manner for these students from this week -- for the first time since April when offline classes were suspended following the fourth wave of Covid-19 in Delhi.The education department had earlier directed schools to obtain written consent from the parents of all students who are willing to visit the school, even as it allowed continuation of online classes for those who opt out of physical classes.Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini and a member of an action committee of over 400 private schools in the capital, said that only 40% of the parents have agreed to send their children to school.“We think that once classes begin, gradually attendance will pick up like it did earlier this year. We have decided to go for a blended mode of learning with our online classes continuing till noon in the first half. Our practicals will continue from 12.30pm to 2.30pm with each student coming to school only twice or thrice a week. At any given point, there won’t be more than 12-13 students in each lab,” she said.On August 9, the Directorate of Education issued guidelines to all schools, following DDMA directives allowing students of classes 10 to 12 to return to school for admissions and board exam-related activities.While a few schools, including Modern Public School in Shalimar Bagh and ITL Public School in Dwarka, reopened last week, most private schools, like Springdales School in Pusa Road, Army Public School in Shankar Vihar, Birla Vidya Niketan, Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, Delhi Public School in Mathura Road and Ahlcon International School in Mayur Vihar are expected to reopen this week.With the Capital’s Covid-19 caseload at a nearly 16-month low, schools and parents had been asking the government if schools will reopen for senior students soon. Schools in Delhi have been closed since March last year and briefly opened in January and February this year only for classes 9 to 12. Offline classes were suspended in April due to the rise in Covid-19 cases.Many stakeholders had been calling for reopening schools mainly because of the two-term board examination, introduced by CBSE to prepare for an “unprecedented situation” arising due to the pandemic, next year. The first set of board examinations for classes 10 and 12, based on a bifurcated syllabus and in the MCQ format, is set to take place between November and December this year.Suman Aswal, who teaches Biology at The Indian School in Sheikh Sarai, said, “We will focus on practicals as other guidance can be given online as well... We will also discuss what kind of multiple choice questions students can expect.”Most government schools in the Capital will start classes on Monday and principals have been asked to ensure vaccination of staff on a priority basis.Sukhbir Singh Yadav, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Phase 3 and president of Vice and Principals’ Association of Delhi, said his school started practicals for Class 12 on Thursday and will begin the same for Class 10 students from Monday. “We will be addressing their queries related to theory and practical exams for a maximum of three hours per day. The paper pattern has also changed this year so we need to train our students accordingly. Students slated to appear for their compartment exams between August and September can also visit schools for guidance,” he said.Some schools will also focus on counselling students to ease their transition to offline classes.Rakesh Semalty, principal of a government school in West Jyoti Nagar, said, “Counselling sessions will be of one hour and in small batches of 15-20 students. All subject teachers have one session with each batch in which they will personally interact with students and resolve their issues related to online classes, time management, syllabus splits, examination methods of board, practical classes, record keeping, personal well-being and moving forward with caution, concept and confidence. Practicals and projects will begin next week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-staggered-sessions-as-schools-reopen-for-classes-1012-101629050901681.html
16-08-2021||Pune||Section 144 in force at tourist spots in Pune||Even as weekend restrictions have been eased in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad with rural areas have been upgrated to Level 3 from Level 4 restrictions, Pune rural police have said that parts of Section 144 imposed at the tourists spots in Pune district are still in place. Abhinav Deshmukh, superintendent of police, Pune, said the police personnel would be deployed at the tourist spots to avoid crowding. Anticipating the crowding on weekends, nakabandi has been done by the police on the road to popular tourist destinations in Lonavla. “Our order of imposing Section 144 at the listed tourist spots in the district is a special order and it is still applicable. So, the locations listed in the order will continue to have the restrictions under Section 144. Police deployment would be at these spots for this weekend as well. In rural parts, Level 3 restrictions are in place and tourist spots continue to have curbs,” said Deshmukh. He, however, clarified that the movement of those going to hotels or resorts on pre-booking basis would be allowed. “Popular tourist destinations belong in seven tehsils. People can go to pre-booked hotels and resorts, but crowding at tourist spots is still prohibited,” said Deshmukh. Anticipating the arrival of a huge number of tourists to Lonavla, police put nakabandi at eight spots on Saturday and it would continue on Sunday as well. “On weekdays we don’t have to do nakabandi at so many places. In Lonavla, police bandobast has been put in place at Tiger Point, Lion’s Point, Ekvira Devi temple, Pawana nagar, Varsoli toll plaza, Neelsagar and Bhaje Karla caves. We have been requesting tourists to return,” said Tayuub Mujavar, police inspector Lonavla (rural). Haveli police have also deployed police force at Khadakwasla and Gholewadi chowk. ““Nobody would be allowed at tourist spots. For weekends, extra three officers and 22 police personnel have been appointed. The nakabandi would be at Khadakwasla and Gholewadi chowk,” said Sadashiv Shelar, police inspector Haveli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/section-144-in-force-at-tourist-spots-in-pune-101628965683841.html

Upon visiting the Ranade institute, the minister first met the SPPU vice-chancellor, university officials and student union- and journalists’ association- representatives.At a press conference held at the Ranade institute, Pune, on Saturday, Samant said, “Since the past few days, I have been receiving several letters from across the state regarding the Ranade institute merger. Hence, I came here today to discuss the matter with university officials, student representatives and even the journalists’ association. It was unanimously decided to cancel the decision to merge the Ranade institute department of communication and journalism at Fergusson college road with media and communication studies inside the university campus.”The minister also announced the formation of a committee to upgrade the academic and infrastructural development of the DoCJ aka Ranade institute. “At the same time, we have appointed a one-member committee of Vikas Chandra Rastogi, principal secretary of the higher and technical education department. The merger decision has been cancelled, and now the academic and infrastructural development of this institute will be carried out.

Hence, the district administration has decided to divert all the vaccine stock it got on Saturday for second dose beneficiaries, both Covishield and Covaxin. As of now, second dose vaccines could be given between 84-112 days after the first dose which was increased due to the short supply of vaccines, however, despite this increased gap many are not able to get the second dose as there is an acute shortage of vaccine supply. The rural administration has diverted its entire stock of 50,000 Covishield doses and 3,000 Covaxin doses for second doses beneficiaries. On Saturday, the district received 5,260 doses of Covaxin of which Pune rural received 3,000 doses, PMC 1,260 and PCMC 1,000 doses and also 1,15,000 total doses of Covishield of which Pune rural got 50,000 doses, PMC 40,000 and PCMC 25,000 doses. However, in view of over 0.221 million beneficiaries awaiting their second dose in rural Pune, the zilla parishad has decided to divert the entire fresh stock for only second dose beneficiaries which means that those wanting to get the first dose of their vaccine would have to wait longer. Dr Sachin Edake, district immunisation officer said, “As of August 8, Pune rural has 207,164 people awaiting their second dose of Covishield and 14,498 people awaiting their second dose of Covaxin. We have diverted this new stock of 50,000 doses of Covishield and 3,000 doses of Covaxin for only second dose beneficiaries because they need to get their second shot within the stipulated period after 84 days. It has been delayed already for some of them, but we do not want to delay it any further because it might affect their immunity through vaccines.” Earlier, the zilla parishad had appealed to private hospitals to exchange their existing stock with fresh stock for later in September as the ZP faced shortage of vaccines for second dose beneficiaries. However private hospitals did not respond positively to the appeal. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) too received its fresh stock on Saturday which would be used in its Monday vaccination drive. Dr Suryakant Deokar, PMC immunisation officer said, “Earlier we had reserved 60-40 ratio for second and first dose which is now 70-30 of which 15% would be reserved for walk in first dose beneficiaries and 15% for online slot booking first dose beneficiaries and rest 70% if reserved for second dose beneficiaries. This has been done as per the guidelines set by the state government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/amidst-shortage-of-vaccine-for-pune-rural-admn-diverts-new-stock-for-second-dose-beneficiaries-101628964727066.html

In view of the fact that the Zika virus could be sexually transmitted, the administration is also distributing condoms to young couples and potential mothers as the infection, although asymptomatic for mothers, could lead to microcephaly in foetuses. The survey may go on for months as the central team has asked to ensure zero new cases of dengue and chikunugunya and zero detection of larvae breeding for at least two weeks which means that the survey would go on for months till the monsoon season is over. To continue the survey, the administration is planning to train volunteers from the villages to visit every household regularly. Dr Ujjawala Jadhav, taluka health officer of Purandar taluka, which was ground zero for Zika virus in the state, said, “We are identifying volunteers who could survey households regularly. It would not be possible for only health officials and our staff to survey all the homes in these six villages regularly and so we are training volunteers from each of the villages and they would inspect 20 homes per volunteer and look for symptoms. They would also be responsible for larvae collection and detection. The volunteers would be trained for the same. In case anyone is found positive for any of the symptoms, then the volunteer would inform the nearest primary health centre and then their blood samples would be sent for further tests. The central team has asked us to continue the survey until not even one dengue or chikungunya case is reported or even aedes larvae are found in these villages consistently for two weeks.” The central team has asked to keep a tab on pregnant women. Even though the mortality due to Zika infection is much less and almost 80% of the cases are asymptomatic, they could be potential carriers. The virus also has a great impact on unborn children as it can cause microcephaly. The blood samples of pregnant women have been surveyed and all necessary precautions have been taken. Potential couples who could become pregnant have been asked to use contraception and the district administration has distributed condoms to the young couples. “We have given almost 10-15 condoms per couple which we will give in regular intervals, as per protocol until we can be sure that there is no infection prevalent,” said Dr Jadhav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/belasar-villagers-turn-volunteers-condoms-distributed-to-check-zika-virus-spread-101628964603659.html
16-08-2021||Pune||Pune Curtain Call: Marketing theatre in the new world, the social media way||The play “Amar Photo Studio” was ready to be shown to the world. Its journey from seed to the theatre piece it had transformed into has been witnessed in the articles of the previous weeks. “Amar Photo Studio” had enjoyed a wonderful social media marketing campaign. It was hailed as one of it’s USPs and I feel fortunate to have witnessed the start of social media trend. The actors in the play were extremely popular and were a household name because of the TV series they were a part of. The series had ended recently and the actors had decided to work on this play. While they were popular individually, the audience used to love them more as a unit. So, it was very smart of them to continue working together. While we were rehearsing, none of them put up anything about the play on their social media handles. So, the fact that the beloved unit is working on something was kept a secret from the audience, who were looking forward to seeing them again. Once the date of the opening show was finalised, we decided to start publicity. Traditionally, publicity of Marathi theatre is done through the medium of newspaper. A photoshoot is organised a few weeks before the show. And there are two or three advertising agencies who specialise in designing ads for plays. One of them gets a contract. An ad is put out around a week before the show, usually on the preceding Sunday, announcing that this particular play is coming soon. And then advertisement slots are booked in local dailies for two days before every show. Generally, as the cost of these advertisements kept rising year on year, it started becoming a burden to the producers. Especially for amateur theatre groups, advertisement cost takes up a massive part of the budget. But it has to be done! For the past few years, we started an experiment for our theatre group – Natak Company. We knew that most of our audience was young and on social media. We had generated a good amount of traffic on our online pages too. Two to three team members, led by Gandhaar Sangoram, started taking an interest in social media marketing. They started designing creative advertisements for social media and made full use of the current social media trends. We also shifted our ticketing online rather than the traditional ticket window. We noticed that most of our shows were getting sold out online and one day we decided to not put out an ad in the newspaper and see if it affects our sale in any way. It didn’t. And that just signalled the arrival of a different time in publicity for us. In the case of this particular play, almost all actors had a sizeable social media following and we were confident that word about this play will reach the audience once they upload an announcement. But we thought of doing something quirky before starting actual publicity. Since the play has a large element of time travel and revolves around a photo studio, one of the team members suggested putting up a passport size picture of their childhood with the hashtag of “Amar Photo Studio”. Nothing else will be mentioned. Just the picture and the hashtag. Everyone liked the idea and felt that it was a good teaser before the actual advertisement. It was decided that Amey Wagh will put up the first picture and then all other actors will follow suit in the coming days, which will pique the curiosity of the audience and we will have their attention. Just as Amey was about to upload his childhood passport size picture, I remember that Gandhaar suddenly stopped him. He gave a suggestion to tag three random people in the post, urging them to put up a childhood passport size picture of theirs. We all agreed and Amey posted his picture and tagged three others who had a sizeable social media following with the hashtag of our play. The three friends also put their pictures up graciously, along with the hashtag, and they tagged three of their friends. By evening, the trend had caught up and everyone was speaking about “Amar Photo Studio”, but no one knew what it was! Everyone we knew wanted to be tagged and wanted to be a part of it. Some who weren’t tagged just put up their pictures anyway! It was featured in the news and it was termed “Amar Photo Studio challenge”. When we made the actual announcement, the play was already hyped up because of the social media campaign. The fact that these actors were coming together was a bonus! Traditionally, a play usually starts drawing audience after twenty-five to thirty shows and once word spreads about it. We enjoyed an overwhelming response from the first show itself! Not only was the play a commercial hit, it also laid the foundation of a social media management company for Gandhaar! Whenever I used to visit the theatre, the ticket checkers and other theatre staff used to tell me that they were witnessing a change in the audience demography. Never had they seen young people in such large numbers who have come to watch a play. It felt wonderful to be able to achieve this! Nipun Dharmadhikari is a storyteller and looks forward to telling them on stage, in front of the camera or in person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-marketing-theatre-in-the-new-world-101628944200433.html
16-08-2021||World||‘Their futures are not lost’: Malala Yousafzai’s call for countries to open borders for Afghan refugees||United Nations messenger of peace and Nobel peace laureate Malala Yousafzai on Monday appealed to the countries to open their borders and take in refugees fleeing Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover. In an exclusive interview to the BBC, the Pakistani-origin activist said that every country has a “role and responsibility” to help the displaced people.“We have to take some bold stance for the protection of women and girls, for the protection of minority groups and for peace and stability in that region. I think every country has a role and responsibility right now. Countries need to open their borders to Afghan refugees, to the displaced people,” she told the BBC.Notably, Yousafzai, a Pakistani activist, was shot by the Taliban in 2012 for her campaign supporting girls’ education. She was later treated in a hospital in the UK. She received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 becoming the youngest ever Nobel winner.Also read | Military evacuation flights resume, total anarchy in KabulIn the video of the interview shared by the BBC, she called the situation in Afghanistan an urgent humanitarian crisis. “We are seeing some shocking images on our screens right now. People are just escaping, they are finding a way to keep themselves safe. So, when you see that, you realise that this is actually an urgent humanitarian crisis right now,” she said. “We are living in a world where we are talking about advancements, about equality, about gender equality. We can not see a country going decades and centuries back,” she further said.The comments came as several videos were shared by news agencies showing many people crowding the Kabul airport in a desperate attempt to leave the country. Many countries like the US, the UK and India are currently in the process of evacuating their personnel and diplomats, which is hindered by the closure of Kabul airport earlier in the day.She also said that she had written to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan urging him to take in refugees from Afghanistan. “I have sent a letter to Prime Minister Imran Khan (of Pakistan) asking him to allow refugees but also ensure that the refugee children and girls have access to education and have access to safety and protection,” she said. “Their futures are not lost, they can enroll in local schools, they can receive education within those refugee camps,” she added.Appealing to everyone to take a bold stance supporting the protection of human rights, Yousafzai said that the issue is not just about the peace of Afghanistan but globally. “I have not yet made contact with Prime Minister Boris Johnson (of the UK), but whoever can hear me right now, I think it’s important for them to remember that they have such an important strategic leadership role to play right now. And they must take a bold stance for the protection of human rights right now. It is important not just for the peace in Afghanistan but peace globally,” she told the BBC.Earlier on Monday, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) called for an emergency meeting regarding the situation in Afghanistan, during which the secretary-general Antonio Guterres and the US ambassador to the UN also called for global support. US ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said that the US would resettle Afghan nationals in its country and also called for more countries to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/their-futures-are-not-lost-malala-yousafzai-s-call-for-countries-to-open-borders-for-afghan-refugees-101629135764910.html
16-08-2021||World||Region will feel safer if Afghan soil isn’t used by terror groups: India at UNSC meet||India said on Monday that Afghanistan’s neighbours and the region would feel safer if Afghan soil isn’t used by terror groups to attack any other country as the UN Security Council debated the situation in the war-torn country following a Taliban takeover. Most of the 15 permanent and non-permanent members of the Security Council said the Taliban must ensure the territory of Afghanistan is not used by groups such as al-Qaeda and Islamic State. They called on the Taliban to ensure the security of foreign missions and humanitarian organisations during the second meeting on Afghanistan within 10 days under the Indian presidency of the UN body. However, remarks by the representatives of Russia and China hinted at a greater willingness to engage with the Taliban, who entered Kabul on Sunday after the civilian government collapsed as President Ashraf Ghani fled the country. Russia’s envoy to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, singled out Iran as an important regional player that could work with the “extended troika”, which includes Pakistan. India’s ambassador to the UN, TS Tirumurti, noted the situation in Afghanistan had dramatically changed since the last Security Council meeting 10 days ago, and was of “great concern” to New Delhi. He reiterated India’s call for respecting the rights of Afghan women, children and minorities, and added that a “broader representation would help the arrangement gain more acceptability and legitimacy”. “The current situation in Afghanistan has numerous challenges. However, there are a few opportunities. If there is a zero tolerance for terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and it is ensured that the territory of Afghanistan is not used by terrorist groups to threaten or attack any other country, then Afghanistan’s neighbours and the region would feel safer,” he said. Tirumurti noted that Afghan men, women and children are living in a constant state of fear amid increasing violations of their fundamental rights, and said: “We hope that the situation stabilises soon, and the parties concerned address the humanitarian and security issues. We also hope that there is an inclusive dispensation which represents all sections of Afghan society.” The world community and the Security Council should ensure an immediate cessation of violence and contain any possible crisis, and countries should rise above partisan interests to support Afghans to achieve peace, stability and security, he said. Recalling India’s contributions to the development of Afghanistan, Tirumurti said the country had ongoing development projects in all of the 34 Afghan provinces in critical areas such as power, water supply, road connectivity and healthcare. Russian envoy Nebenzia said Kabul had been “quickly abandoned by the country’s leader” and widespread bloodshed had been avoided as the Taliban entered the Afghan capital on Sunday. “Currently, we believe there is no point in panicking... Russia will interact with the Taliban irrespective of the evolving situation and their specific actions,” he added. Referring to Russia’s “extended troika” group that includes the US, China and Pakistan, Nebenzia said: “We believe that an important role could be played by Iran as well here.” Chinese deputy permanent representative Geng Shuang noted that some Security Council members desired a greater role to be played by Afghanistan’s neighbours, and, in an apparent reference to Pakistan, said: “We learnt that some regional countries and Afghanistan’s neighbours had made a request to participate in today’s meeting. It is regrettable that their requests were not granted.” Pakistan’s efforts to join both the Security Council meetings did not meet with success, with the body’s members turning down the country’s request. Geng further noted that the Taliban had said the war in Afghanistan has ended and that the group will negotiate to establish “an open and inclusive Islamic government” and take “responsible actions” for the safety of Afghans and foreign missions. He hoped the Taliban will unite with all parties and ethnic groups to establish a broad and inclusive political structure for lasting peace. Both Geng and Nebenzia also referred to threats posed to their countries by terror groups based in Afghanistan, such as Islamic State, al-Qaeda and ETIM, but made no mention of organisations such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed that pose concerns for India. US permanent representative Linda Thomas-Greenfield called on all parties to prevent terrorism and to ensure Afghanistan “cannot ever, ever again be a base for terrorism”, while the UK representative noted that the Taliban had pledged at Doha to engage in talks in good faith but “their actions on the ground have betrayed that promise”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/region-will-feel-safer-if-afghan-soil-isn-t-used-by-terror-groups-india-at-unsc-meet-101629137847306.html

To add to their fears, the Taliban is going door to door in Kabul with a list of government officials and journalists who wrote or spoke against them in the past,” said a civilian on phone from Kabul.After the mayhem at the Kabul international airport earlier on Monday, the US have taken control of the Air Traffic Control and technical area and are only allowing military flights to evacuate people with hundreds of Afghans waiting at the tarmac for their turn. The mood is very grim in Kabul with majority Afghans blaming the US forces for abandoning them to the extremists.Also read | After Taliban take over Afghanistan, countries urge for protection of human lifeHowever, diplomats in Kabul blame British Army Chief Nick Carter for blindsiding the US and cutting out a bad deal with the Taliban, leading to the ensuing chaos.

Some countries including Israel have already gone ahead with plans to give booster doses.However, the decision by a few rich countries to buy booster shots has drawn the ire of health activists and the World Health Organisation (WHO), which has called for a moratorium on boosters until at least the end of September.Also Read | WHO calls for moratorium on Covid booster shots as Delta variant threatens lives of unvaccinatedPfizer and BioNTech had said that all patients in the trial received the third shot, BNT162b2, eight to nine months after their second dose.The drugmakers will submit the trial data to the European Medicines Agency and other regulatory authorities in the coming weeks.

He briefed them regarding arrangements made by Pakistan to enable evacuation of diplomats and staff, INGOs, media, and representatives of international organisations, and others from Afghanistan.“The members of the Diplomatic Corps were informed that all requests for evacuation/relocation may be directed to the ministry of foreign affairs, which will be processed expeditiously,” PTI reported quoting a foreign office statement.In the matter of rendering assistance to Pakistani citizens in Afghanistan, the foreign office stated that it was not only contributing in that but the embassy of Pakistan in Kabul was also working to extend requisite consular services for such facilitation.The embassy continued to issue visas on a fast-track basis, and procedures have also been arranged to grant visas-on-arrival at Pakistan’s international airports, the foreign office said according to PTI.A 24/7 special inter-ministerial cell or facilitation centre has been set up in the ministry of interior to aid in such visas on arrival matters, and the telephone numbers of the centre were also shared with the Diplomatic Corps for smooth coordination associated with the evacuation.The foreign office further stated that starting August 15, Pakistan commenced to receive special flights from Kabul. “Pakistan will continue to provide all possible assistance and facilitation to the international community for the smooth and expeditious evacuation from Afghanistan,” the foreign office was quoted as saying by PTI.The statement from the foreign office came after two Pakistan International Airline (PIA) flights on Sunday brought back nearly 500 stranded persons from Kabul, even as more flights are scheduled, officials told PTI.However, quoting a spokesperson of PIA, Geo News reported on Monday that the national carrier suspended flight operations to Kabul for an “unidentified period” after a “large number of people gathered at the runway” trying to flee as Taliban regained control over Afghanistan after two decades.Notably, the carrier had plans to operate three flights between Islamabad and Kabul to bring back several more Pakistanis and other nationals wishing to depart from Kabul.This development comes after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday praised the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan by saying Afghans have “broken the shackles of slavery”. His comments come in the backdrop of Afghanistan blaming Pakistan for providing supplies, including arms, medical aid and logistics to the Taliban.Watch here | Imran Khan praises Taliban takeover, calls it 'breaking chains of slavery'The group had been on a rampage for the past several weeks, capturing almost all the major provincial capitals before making their entry into Kabul on Sunday, and later in the day taking over the presidential palace.Afghan president Ashraf Ghani and some of his close aides fled the country as the Taliban were approaching the capital. Although a few Afghan social media platforms called Ghani a “coward” for leaving his fellow country people in such despair, he took to Facebook on Monday to say that his move was aimed at preventing a “flood of bloodshed.”US troops reportedly fired shots into the air at Kabul airport on Monday after scores of Afghans assembled at the airport, trying to get to the plane in order to leave Afghanistan as Taliban fighters entered the city.Also Read | US forces fire in air to stop jostling Afghans at Kabul airportThe US had earlier shifted its embassy to the airport and has been evacuating its diplomats and other citizens.

Soon after India assumed the presidency of the Security Council, for a month, starting on August 1, UNSC convened a meeting on Afghanistan on August 6 amid stalled talks between the now-defunct Afghan government and the Taliban in Doha and just days before the extended Troika meeting — of Pakistan, China and the US — in Qatar on August 11.Panic gripped Kabul after the Taliban took control of Afghanistan's presidential palace on Sunday following President Ashraf Ghani's escape to a central Asian country. The Islamist insurgents were waiting to take over the Afghan capital.Thousands of people were seen gathering at the international airport in Kabul, the only exit points out of the country not in control of the Taliban yet, in a last-ditch effort to leave the war-torn nation, even as the administration shut the civilian airspace over Afghanistan.ALSO READ | Closure of Kabul airport puts pause on repatriation of IndiansVisuals shared on various social media platforms showed hundreds of people running across the airport tarmac American soldiers fired warning shots into the air, also prompting temporary hold on its evacuation process from Kabul to clear the airfield.Even as the Taliban have said no one would be “harmed”, thousands of people are desperate to flee the country as many Afghans were apprehensive of the Taliban rule.Guterres also urged all countries to be willing to receive Afghan refugees and asked them to refrain from deporting them back to the war-torn nation now taken over by the Taliban."The international community must unite to make sure that Afghanistan is never again used as a platform or safe haven for terrorist organisations," Guterres told the UNSC, according to Reuters.ALSO READ | After Taliban take over Afghanistan, countries urge for protection of human lifeThe UN chief also urged the Taliban to "exercise utmost restraint" to protect lives."The message from the international community to those on the warpath must be clear: seizing power through military force is a losing proposition ... I call on the Taliban to immediately halt the offensive and to negotiate in good faith in the interest of Afghanistan and its people," Guterres said.The rapidity with which the Taliban took over various provinces of the country, 20 years after they were routed, has stunned the US officials.

The Uzbek government also said that the plane had crossed the border “illegally” and the incident is currently being probed.“The military plane illegally crossed the border of Uzbekistan. An investigation is underway,” news agency AFP quoted ministry spokesperson Bakhrom Zulfikarov as saying, earlier in the day.Meanwhile, some news reports showed that the plane was shot down and the pilot ejected out of it. The Uzbek air defences shot the plane down as it tried to violate the border, news agency Reuters reported citing the country’s defence ministry.“Uzbekistan's air defence forces prevented an attempt by an Afghan military aircraft to illegally cross Uzbekistan's border,” Reuters quoted spokesperson Zulfikarov as saying on Monday.Uzbekistan is one of the many countries that share a border with the land-locked Afghanistan. The spokesperson’s comments confirmed the Uzbek media reports about a plane crash that took place late Sunday in the country’s southern province of Surkhondaryo bordering Afghanistan, AFP further reported.Earlier on Sunday, the Uzbek news website Gazeta.uz reported that a plane with Afghan insignia crashed in the Sherabad district of Surkhandarya region and several users had shared pictures and videos of the crash on social media.On Monday, the spokesperson also confirmed the crash to Russian news agency TASS. “Indeed, an Afghan Air Force plane crashed the other day in the Surkhandarya region of Uzbekistan. Currently, the details of the incident are being studied and the relevant information will be reported later,” Zulfikarov had told TASS.Further, Bekpulat Okboyev, a doctor in the Surkhondaryo province, said that two patients wearing Afghan military uniforms were taken in by his hospital on Sunday evening, AFP also reported. Also, one of the patients came in “with a parachute” and had suffered fractures, the doctor added.Uzbekistan’s foreign ministry on Sunday also said that 84 Afghan servicemen crossed the border into their country seeking assistance.

16-08-2021||World||Closure of Kabul airport puts pause on repatriation of Indians||India on Monday pledged to stand by its Afghan partners but said the suspension of operations at Kabul airport has “forced a pause” in the government’s efforts to repatriate its officials and nationals following the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban. The government is working to facilitate the repatriation of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus who wish to leave Afghanistan as well as some Indian nationals, who are still in the war-torn country, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said. “The security situation in Kabul has deteriorated significantly in the last few days. It is changing rapidly even as we speak,” Bagchi said in the first official reaction from the Indian side to the fall of President Ashraf Ghani’s government after the Taliban marched into Kabul on Sunday. “Commercial operations from Kabul airport have been suspended [on Monday]. This has forced a pause in our repatriation efforts. We are awaiting the resumption of flights to restart the process,” Bagchi said. The sudden closure of Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport threw schedules for the few remaining airlines operating flights to Afghanistan into disarray, including Air India, which had a flight scheduled for 12.30 pm. Two NOTAMs or notices to airmen – official notices containing essential information on flight operations – issued by the Afghanistan Civil Aviation Authority said the civilian side of the airport was “closed until further notice” and that Kabul’s airspace “has been released to the military”. The second NOTAM advised all “transit aircraft to reroute” and cautioned that “any transit through Kabul airspace will be uncontrolled”. Chaos reigned at Kabul airport, which was under the control of US troops, as thousands of desperate Afghans entered the terminal building and walked on to the tarmac in hopes of getting on to any of the aircraft taking off. Amid sporadic firing by the US troops, there were reports that five people were killed. At least two more people who had clung to an US military jet fell to their deaths. Bagchi said the Indian side is in constant touch with representatives of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus and will “facilitate repatriation to India of those who wish to leave Afghanistan”. He added, “There are also a number of Afghans who have been our partners in the promotion of our mutual developmental, educational and people-to-people endeavours. We will stand by them.” At the same time, the Indian side is “aware that there are still some Indian nationals in Afghanistan who wish to return and we are in touch with them”, Bagchi said. Last year, the Indian government had helped more than 380 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus to travel to the country. The situation in Afghanistan, Bagchi said, is being monitored on a constant basis at high levels, and the government “will take all steps to ensure the safety and security of Indian nationals and our interests in Afghanistan”. He pointed out that several advisories had been issued for the safety and security of Indian nationals in Afghanistan, including calling for their immediate return home. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that a few hundred Indians, including diplomats, officials and security personnel posted at the embassy in Kabul, and citizens were currently in Kabul. Military aircraft have been on standby for evacuation flights and two C-17 Globemaster heavy lift aircraft have been sent to Kabul via Iranian airspace since Sunday. One of these aircraft returned on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/closure-of-kabul-airport-puts-pause-on-repatriation-of-indians-101629121645840.html

16-08-2021||World||Haiti hospitals overwhelmed by quake victims as death toll hits 1,297||Haiti's hospitals were swamped on Sunday by thousands of injured residents after a devastating earthquake the day before killed at least 1,297 people as authorities raced to bring doctors to the worst-hit areas before a major storm hits.The 7.2 magnitude quake on Saturday destroyed thousands of homes and buildings in a Caribbean nation which is still clawing its way back from another major temblor 11 years ago and is reeling from the assassination of its president last month.Southwestern Haiti bore the brunt of the blow, especially in the region in and around the town of Les Cayes. Haiti's Civil Protection Agency said the toll from the disaster had climbed to 1,297 and the hospitals that were still functioning were struggling to cope as some 5,700 people were injured.In the northwestern city of Jeremie, another badly hit area, doctors treated injured patients on hospital stretchers underneath trees and on mattresses by the side of the road, as healthcare centers have run out of space."We do have a serious issue," Jerry Chandler, the head of Haiti's Civil Protection Agency, told Reuters."There are very important facilities that are dysfunctional as we speak and those that are functional are receiving an overflow of patients," he said.The challenge facing Haiti has been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, a severe economic downturn aggravated by fierce gang violence, and a political crisis that has engulfed the troubled nation after the assassination of President Jovenel Moise on July 7.Churches, hotels, hospitals and schools were badly damaged or destroyed, while the walls of a prison were rent open by the violent shudders that convulsed Haiti. Some 13,694 houses were destroyed, the civil protection agency said, suggesting the toll could rise further.In Les Cayes, a seafront town of some 90,000 people, rescuers in red hard hats and blue overalls pulled bodies from the tangled wreckage of one building, as a yellow mechanical excavator nearby helped to shift the rubble.Haiti's Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who flew to visit Les Cayes, praised the dignity shown by people there even in the midst of their suffering."They are affected but resilient. They fight to survive," he said, thanking international agencies and foreign governments for their support.Nearby countries, including the Dominican Republic and Mexico, rushed to send desperately needed food and medicines by air and across Haiti's land border. Colombia sent search and rescue personnel.The United States dispatched vital supplies and deployed a 65-person urban search-and-rescue team with specialized equipment, said Samantha Power, the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).From the Vatican, Pope Francis urged the international community to show support swiftly. "May solidarity from everyone lighten the consequences of the tragedy," he told pilgrims and tourists at his Sunday blessing in St. Peter's Square.However, Haiti's government appealed to aid organizations against setting up makeshift camps and urged them to work through the planning ministry, an apparent attempt to avoid the mistakes made following the devastating 2010 earthquake https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/haitis-history-violence-rebellion-2021-07-23 that killed tens of thousands of people.Many Haitians prepared on Sunday to spend a second night sleeping in the open, traumatized by memories of that magnitude 7 quake 11 years ago that struck far closer to the sprawling capital, Port-au-Prince.At Port-au-Prince airport, international aid workers, doctors and rescue workers boarded flights to Les Cayes. A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter ferried the wounded.The rescue and aid efforts will be complicated by Tropical Depression Grace, which is expected to lash Haiti with heavy rainfall on Monday. Some 75 to 100 milliliters of rainfall was expected, which may trigger landslides and cause some rivers to flood, Haiti's Civil Protection Agency said."We ask the population to remain vigilant," the agency added.Thousands of people sleeping in the streets would be exposed to the torrential rains amid a rising risk of water-borne diseases, said Chandler, the head of the agency.The death toll is expected to rise as the telephone network has been down in more remote areas. In difficult-to-reach villages many houses were fragile and built on slopes vulnerable to landslides, said Alix Percinthe, from the ActionAid charity.He said one local leader had informed him there were 47 deaths in his area not yet reported to regional authorities. Footage of Saturday's aftermath posted on social media showed residents reaching into narrow openings in piles of fallen masonry to pull shocked and distraught people from the debris of walls and roofs that had crumbled around them.Access to the worst-hit areas was complicated by a deterioration in law and order that has left key access roads in parts of Haiti in the hands of gangs. In a video posted on social media, one gang leader said the armed groups had declared a truce along the route to Les Cayes.Chandler said boats and helicopters were being used to bring in aid but the government was working to establish safe access by road. The first convoy of aid had made it through by land to the region of Les Cayes.The United Nations called for a "humanitarian corridor" to be established so that aid can pass through gang-held territories.Following Moise's assassination, which authorities have alleged was carried out by a group of largely Colombian mercenaries and Haitian accomplices, Prime Minister Henry said officials would aim to hold elections for a new president as soon as possible.However, reports this week suggested that the vote initially earmarked for September would not take place until November. The chaos unleashed https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/haiti-one-month-without-assassinated-president-jovenel-moise-2021-08-06 by Saturday's disaster is likely to make the task of holding prompt elections harder still.Haiti has long been politically unstable and Haitians have also suffered from problems stemming from international aid efforts and peace-keeping deployments during the past decade.A sexual misconduct scandal centering on Oxfam International blighted the record of charity workers in Haiti, while a cholera outbreak linked to U.N. peacekeepers led to thousands of deaths. (Additional reporting by Kate Chappell in Kingston, Sarah Marsh in Havana and Philip Pullella, Olive Griffin; Writing by Dave Graham, Drazen Jorgic; Editing by Daniel Flynn, Chizu Nomiyama and Diane Craft)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/haiti-hospitals-overwhelmed-by-quake-victims-as-death-toll-hits-1297-101629110969475.html
16-08-2021||World||Hope Taliban will lead an inclusive Afghan govt: China||China said on Monday it hopes Taliban will make good its promise to ensure smooth transition of Afghanistan under an open and inclusive Islamic government, hours after the insurgent group swept unopposed into capital Kabul and took control of the presidential palace.It respects the wishes of the Afghan people and is willing to continue to develop friendly ties with Afghanistan, the Chinese foreign ministry said in its first comments on the rapid changes in Afghanistan’s political landscape.Beijing’s expected endorsement of the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan comes a day after Washington-propped President Ashraf Ghani fled the country.“China respects the Afghan people’s right to decide their own destiny and future, and is willing to continue to develop friendly cooperation with Afghanistan. China will play a constructive role for peace and reconstruction in Afghanistan,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said on Monday.Asked whether China will recognise a Taliban government, Hua said China expects that an inclusive political arrangement that is acceptable to all Afghan people will lay the foundation for lasting peace in the country.“Based on fully respecting the national sovereignty of Afghanistan and the will of various factions in the country, China has maintained contact and communication with the Afghan Taliban and played a constructive role in promoting the political settlement of the Afghan issue,” she saidBeijing and its future role in war-torn Afghanistan has been at the centre of much speculation since US President Joe Biden announced in April a full withdrawal of American troops from the country with a 70-odd km border with China.The high-profile meeting between Taliban leaders and Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi in July added to the conjecture. Wang said the Taliban would “play an important role in the process of peaceful reconciliation and reconstruction in Afghanistan”, after the meeting.That diplomatic forecast by the senior Chinese diplomat is coming true. “The Afghan Taliban said yesterday [Sunday] that the war in Afghanistan has ended and they will negotiate the establishment of an open and inclusive Islamic government and take responsible actions to ensure the safety of Afghan citizens and foreign missions in Afghanistan,” Hua said.“China hopes that these statements can be implemented to ensure the smooth transition of the situation in Afghanistan, curb all kinds of terrorism and criminal acts, and enable the Afghan people to stay away from war and rebuild their beautiful homeland,” Hua said.Hua’s statement was a reminder of what the same delegation, which met foreign minister Wang last month had told him: The Taliban would not allow Afghanistan to become a militant base to fuel separatism in Xinjiang, a strategic apprehension for Beijing.China welcomes the Taliban’s promise that they will allow no force to use the Afghan territory to engage in acts detrimental to China and its expression of hope that China will be more involved in Afghanistan’s peace and reconciliation process and play a bigger role in future reconstruction and economic development, Hua said.“The Taliban have repeatedly expressed their hope to develop good relations with China, and that they look forward to China’s participation in the reconstruction and development of Afghanistan,” Hua added.“We welcome this. China respects the right of the Afghan people to independently determine their own destiny and is willing to continue to develop... friendly and cooperative relations with Afghanistan.”She confirmed that the Chinese embassy in capital Kabul was functioning “as usual” and that the majority of Chinese citizens in the country had been evacuated in advance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hope-taliban-will-lead-an-inclusive-afghan-govt-china-101629113306422.html

She took that step after reading that China's Sinovac vaccine had a lower efficacy than the Pfizer Inc shot, developed with German partner BioNTech, and the Moderna Inc shot, both widely available in the United States. She also consulted with her doctor beforehand.Toni is among the group of people coming from abroad who have been vaccinated a second time, or plan to do so, in the United States.Their reasons range from concerns that the vaccines immediately available to them were not effective enough, fears that they require extra protection against the fast-spreading Delta variant, or a need to meet specific requirements for work or travel. Some are seeking medical advice, others are relying on their own research.A few countries are also beginning to offer a third booster dose to their citizens based on evidence that the initial protection from vaccines wanes over time, or that an extra shot may help prevent infection against Delta, particularly for older people or those with weak immune systems.Public health officials have not determined if booster doses are needed for the general population, and there is not yet much data on the relative risks and benefits of complete revaccination."It is probably more than is needed," said Jason Gallagher, an infectious diseases expert at Temple University's School of Pharmacy. "A fourth dose is probably a waste; a third dose is probably unnecessary for a lot of people."The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged countries to hold off on boosters while many people worldwide wait to receive their first doses.Thirty-six-year-old Chilean engineer Ricardo Dayne, who first received Sinovac's vaccine at home in April got his first Pfizer shot in New York in June."Everyone was also talking about the need to have a booster, so I decided to have it."The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last week authorized a third vaccine dose for immunocompromised people. Government health officials have estimated that would apply to less than 3% of the adult U.S. population, but have said that eventually, boosters may be required more broadly.In the meantime, a surplus of vaccines in the United States, along with a decentralized healthcare system, has made it easier for people to show up at pharmacies and vaccination centers for extra doses. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that over 1.2 million Americans have already received at least one extra dose following their initial inoculation.When asked about travelers doubling up on vaccines, Moderna told Reuters its vaccine is not authorized for this purpose and J&J directed Reuters to the FDA and CDC. Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A CVS Health Corp spokesperson said the company's policy is to turn away patients who have been fully vaccinated at one of its pharmacies, or who disclose that they have been fully vaccinated elsewhere. A Walgreens spokesperson said its pharmacies ask patients if they have been vaccinated during the appointment process and have alerts in place to check.Graduate student Jing Wu, 22, said he had no choice. Wu received the Sinovac vaccine in December while in China before moving to the United States to attend Princeton University.He heard Princeton was planning to require proof of an FDA-approved vaccine. The university's health service urged him to get vaccinated again and said it would be safe.He was not reassured."I was nervous and stressed about it, but in April I got vaccinated (again)," he said, this time with the Johnson & Johnson shot.Princeton announced the policy on April 20 but later decided to accept any WHO-approved vaccine, including Sinovac. The university's health website still states that "there is no known harm from taking additional" vaccines.The university did not respond to requests for comment."If I knew back then the Chinese vaccine would be enough, I wouldn't have done it," Wu said.The United States is developing a plan to require nearly all foreign visitors be fully vaccinated, potentially creating similar issues for many people inoculated with vaccines not approved by the FDA.Britain and the European Union's lists of approved vaccines do not include shots made in Russia or China, which have been used in many countries.Governments should standardize their definition of fully vaccinated to include shots that may not be approved in their countries, but which are still effective, said Dr Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security."This whole process needs to be fixed, otherwise, as we get more vaccines and more people traveling, this will only happen more," Adalja said.(Reporting by Ahmed Aboulenein; Additional reporting by Aislinn Laing in Santiago, Carl O'Donnell and Michael Erman in New York; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Aurora Ellis)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-delta-variant-travelers-double-up-on-vaccine-in-us-101629108207762.html

Khan further spoke about how cultural imposition was tantamount to ‘mental slavery’, according to Pakistan news platform Dawn.com.Addressing the launch of a government education programme, Khan further criticised the existence of “English medium schools” that he said led to the adoption of “someone else’s culture” in Pakistan. “When you adopt someone’s culture you believe it to be superior and you end up becoming a slave to it,” the cricketing legend-turned-premier was quoted as saying.In the same breath, he indirectly likened the ongoing upheaval in Afghanistan with the people of the country breaking the “shackles of slavery".The Taliban’s takeover of the war-torn nation was completed on Sunday when their armed troops swept into capital Kabul without minimal resistance after days of rapid advances, said to be powered by Pakistan with weapons, logistics and medical aid.

President Ashraf Ghani has fled to central Asian country of Tajikistan, and western countries are scrambling to evacuate their citizens.There is chaos at the Kabul airport as frantic Afghans are searching for a way out."Today is a great day for the Afghan people and the mujahideen. They have witnessed the fruits of their efforts and their sacrifices for 20 years," Mohammad Naeem, the spokesman for the Taliban's political office, told Al Jazeera TV.It took the Taliban just over a week to seize control of Afghanistan, 20 years after they were ousted by the American and allied forces. The insurgents overran the country in the wake of the withdrawal of US troops.Who are the Taliban?The movement's inner workings and leadership have always been largely shrouded in secrecy. Here is a rundown of what is known about its structure, and other intriguing facts about the insurgents.Haibatullah Akhundzada: He was appointed as the supreme leader of the Taliban in a power transition after a US drone strike killed his predecessor, Mullah Mansour Akhtar, in 2016.Akhundzada's public profile has somehow been limited to annual messages during Islamic holidays.Mullah Baradar: One of the co-founders, Abdul Ghani Baradar was raised in Kandahar, the birthplace of Taliban. The Soviet invasion in the 1970s turned him into an insurgent. Baradar and cleric Mullah Omar later founded the Taliban in the early 1990s.Mullah Yaqoob: He's the son of Taliban founder Mullah Omar. He heads the powerful military commission, which oversees a vast network of field commanders charged with executing the insurgency's strategic operations.Sirajuddin Haqqani: The son of a commander from the anti-Soviet jihad, Jalaluddin Haqqani, Sirajuddin doubles up as deputy leader of the movement while heading the powerful Haqqani network, a US-designated terror group.The rise of TalibanGenesis: The Taliban, which means "students" in Pashto language, emerged in 1994 around the city of Kandahar. They were the main factions fighting a civil war after the Soviets left Afghanistan. They went on the draw members from the "mujahideen" who, with the support of the United States, repelled the Soviets back in the 1980s. Much later, they gained sole control over most of Afghanistan, proclaiming a powerful Islamic Emirate in 1996 and staying firmly in power until 2001.Modus operandi: During their 1996-2001 reign in the country, they enforced a hugely unpopular and internationally condemned strict version of sharia law. Women across the country were strictly barred from working or studying; they were confined to their homes unless accompanied by a male guardian outdoors. Public executions and floggings were also a common sight. Western films and books were banned. Cultural artefacts seen as blasphemous were destroyed.Global recognition: Only four countries, including neighbour Pakistan, formally recognised the Taliban government when it was in power. Other countries around the world, along with the United Nations, instead recognised a different group holding provinces to the north of Kabul as Afghanistan's government-in-waiting. The US and UN imposed strict sanctions on the Taliban. Even now, most countries are showing no signs of formally recogni the group diplomatically.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-taliban-take-control-of-afghanistan-a-look-at-who-s-who-of-the-leadership-101629093873213.html

This will be the second meeting on Afghanistan under India's presidency at the UNSC.UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres, who has repeatedly condemned the violence against Afghan civilians, is expected to speak at the emergency meeting. The meeting is scheduled for 10am (local time) at the United Nations headquarters in New York. Estonia and Norway have requested this urgent session.The United Nations in Afghanistan has maintained extensive aid operations since the early days of the invasion by the US two decades ago. It is not clear how the Taliban will be regarded by the United Nations in case the insurgents declare themselves the legitimate power in Afghanistan. The United Nations has more than 190 countries as members and most of them have condemned the brutality and forced occupation of the South Asian nation.Taliban captured the capital city Kabul on Sunday and seized the abandoned presidential palace, calling it the moment when the long-running war "ends". President Ashraf Ghani and his close associates have left the country after the Taliban's entry into the capital Kabul.Thousands of people flocked to the Kabul airport to flee the violence as several countries rushed to evacuate their diplomats. Residents near the Kabul airport said they have heard sporadic gunfire, however, no information has been received about the loss of life in the firing so far.Chaotic scenes continued at the Kabul airport on Monday morning, leading to heavy traffic on roads, visuals posted on the social media sites showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unsc-to-hold-emergency-meet-on-afghanistan-as-kabul-plunges-into-chaos-101629089892066.html

The US embassy in Kabul has also been completely evacuated, the department also informed hours after the Taliban insurgents captured the presidential palace in the capital city."All embassy personnel are located on the premises of Hamid Karzai International Airport, whose perimeter is secured by the US Military," spokesman Ned Price said in a statement.According to a Reuters report, all Americans in Afghanistan are expected to be evacuated in the next two to three days. For this, the US has approved another 6,000 troops to facilitate the evacuation process of Americans and Afghan citizens who were working for them from Kabul."Over the next 48 hours, we will have expanded our security presence to nearly 6,000 troops, with a mission focused solely on facilitating these efforts and will be taking over air traffic control," the state department said in a statement. "Tomorrow and over the coming days, we will be transferring out of the country thousands of American citizens who have been resident in Afghanistan, as well as locally employed staff of the US mission in Kabul and their families and other particularly vulnerable Afghan nationals," it added.Meanwhile, Nato allies are also sending troops back to Afghanistan to protect evacuations of their own. They had pulled out their forces ahead of the Biden administration's intended August 31 withdrawal deadline.This comes as residents near Kabul airport reported sporadic gunfire. The US also confirmed this and said that it has instructed US citizens to take shelter in a safe place. "There are reports of the airport taking fire; therefore we are instructing US citizens to shelter in place," the US embassy said in a security alert.Afghanistan was plunged into crisis as the US troops started withdrawing from the country in May and the Taliban made rapid advances capturing city after city. And on Sunday, they reached Kabul city and declared that the war is over and captured the presidential palace. President Ashraf Ghani has already fled the country."Today is a great day for the Afghan people and the mujahideen. They have witnessed the fruits of their efforts and their sacrifices for 20 years," Al-Jazeera TV quoted Mohammad Naeem, the spokesperson for the Taliban's political office, as saying. "Thanks to God, the war is over in the country," Naeem also said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-secures-kabul-airport-perimeter-approves-6-000-troops-to-help-with-evacuations-101629085774311.html
16-08-2021||World||US President Biden faces flak at home for Afghan pull-out||CNN news anchor JakeTapper’s first question to US secretary of state Antony Blinken on his Sunday morning show captured the sense of how the rest of the United States was viewing President Joe Biden’s recent decisions on Afghanistan: “How did President Biden get this so wrong?”As morning hour wore on and Al Jazeera news channel began running clips of Taliban fighters walking around inside the President Palace abandoned by former president Ashraf Ghani, Biden was facing similar questions from both supporters and critics, with varying degrees of outrage and frustration.“This is going to be a stain on this president and this presidency,” said Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Relations Committee, on the same programme with Tapper. “I think he is going to have blood on his hands for what they did.”Ryan Crocker, who was president Barack Obama’s ambassador to Afghanistan, could sense the impending disaster. “I’m left with some grave questions in my mind about his ability to lead our nation as commander-in-chief,” Crocker told The Spokesman-Review, a Washington state publication, on Sunday morning, shortly before news came of the Taliban entering Kabul.“To have read this so wrong - or, even worse, to have understood what was likely to happen and not care,” the former ambassador of the Obama-Biden administration added.Biden did not issue any statement or posted a tweet all day. He is vacationing at the Camp David presidential retreat in the adjoining state of Maryland. News reports suggested he is expected to address the nation in the next few days, which in itself is odd given the urgency of the situation.As questions began to be raise about where was the president at this critical juncture in the nation’s history, the White House released a picture of him at a long table in a room with flags in a virtual conference with his national security team. Dressed in a casual t-shirt, he looked terribly alone.“This morning, the president and vice-president met with their national security team and senior officials to hear updates on the drawdown of our civilian personnel in Afghanistan, evacuations of SIV (special immigration visa) applicants and other Afghan allies, and the ongoing security situation in Kabul,” the White House wrote in the tweet.Barely a month ago, Biden has strenuously discounted any chance of the Taliban gaining early control of Kabul and the country. “Afghan troops have 300,000 well-equipped - as well-equipped as any army in the world - and an air force against something like 75,000 Taliban. It is not inevitable,” he had said on July 8 when asked if Taliban takeover was inevitable.More recently, Biden has said he does not regret the decision to pull US forces out of Afghanistan ending a “forever war”, but as the Taliban advanced swiftly in recent days to take control of the country, he has sought to deflect some of the criticism of his own actions by pointing to the flawed deal he inherited from Trump.“I inherited a deal cut by my predecessor - which he invited the Taliban to discuss at Camp David on the eve of 9/11 of 2019 -that left the Taliban in the strongest position militarily since 2001 and imposed a May 1, 2021 deadline on US forces,” Biden said, referring to a meeting that Trump had wanted to host at Camp David but did not.Trump had also drawn down US forces to a “a bare minimum of 2,500”, Biden, said, adding, that when he took over as president, he had two choices “follow through on the deal, with a brief extension to get our forces and our allies’ forces out safely, or ramp up our presence and send more American troops to fight once again in another country’s civil conflict”.Biden and his officials have since gone on to blame the “hollow” response of the Afghan army and security forces and their inability to hold off the Taliban despite their numerical superiority and better American-supplied equipment.“We would have been back at war with tens of thousands of troops having to go in because the 2,500 troops we had there and the air power would not have sufficed to deal with the situation, especially as we see, alas, the hollowness of the Afghan security forces.” Blinken said in the CNN interview.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-faces-flak-at-home-for-afghan-pullout-101629085823368.html

16-08-2021||World||Anthony Fauci says US can move quickly to offer 3rd vaccine shots||Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, said the U.S. will be “absolutely prepared” to distribute a third shot of the coronavirus vaccine quickly to a wider population if needed.He gave no timeline but said health officials are evaluating various groups “on a daily and weekly basis.”“So if it turns out, as the data come in, we see we do need to give an additional dose to people in nursing homes, actually, or people who are elderly we will be absolutely prepared to do that very quickly,” he said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”The issue of extra, or booster, shots has become more pressing, amid questions about “breakthrough” infections among the fully vaccinated, particularly with the more contagious delta variant now prevalent in the U.S., and whether the shots’ efficacy declines over time. Last week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved a third shot for people with compromised immune systems.The New York Times reported on Saturday that, with 100 million doses stockpiled, the Biden administration has begun drawing up plans to offer booster shots to some Americans as early as this fall.‘Nasty One’Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said no decision had been made “because right now the data we have from the U.S. says people who are vaccinated are fully protected, even against delta.”But, Collins said on Fox News “Sunday,” “there is a concern that the vaccine may start to wane in its effectiveness over months. And delta is a nasty one for us to try to deal with. The combination of those two means we may need boosters, maybe beginning first with health care providers, as well as people in nursing homes, and then gradually moving forward.”Fauci also raised the issue of possibly stronger mandates either to wear masks or to get inoculated, at a time when he said 90 million in the U.S. who are eligible remain unvaccinated. He has in the past advocated voluntary vaccine mandates at the local level and in businesses.“We’ve got to do mitigation, put aside all of these issues of concern about liberties and personal liberties and realize we have a common enemy, and that common enemy is the virus,” he said. “And we really have to all pull together to get on top of this otherwise, we’re going to continue to suffer as we’re seeing right now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-says-us-can-move-quickly-to-offer-3rd-vaccine-shots-101629081359019.html

The quake was followed by a series of aftershocks, and Tropical Storm Grace is forecast to hit the crisis-prone nation on Monday.The quake hit 7.5 miles northeast of the town of Saint-Luis du Sud on the country’s southwestern Tiburon Peninsula.Prime Minister Ariel Henry declared a state of emergency, and pledged to “mobilize all the resources of my administration to help victims.”The quake and the aftershocks damaged churches, hotels, hospitals and homes. It also caused a large landslide that blocked the main road from Les Cayes to Jeremie on the southwestern tip of the island.

16-08-2021||World||Pentagon to send 1,000 troops to help in evacuation||The Pentagon authorized another 1,000 troops to help evacuate US citizens and Afghans who worked for them from Kabul, a US official said on Sunday, after the embassy warned the security situation at the city's airport was changing quickly.The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the addition brings the total number of troops in Afghanistan temporarily to 6,000. The soldiers would come from the 82nd Airborne Division, which had been on standby.Residents reported sporadic gunfire in the area of the Hamid Karzai International Airport, the main point of evacuations out of Afghanistan, as US troops aided the departure of US personnel after the Taliban entered the Afghan capital."There are reports of the airport taking fire; therefore we are instructing US citizens to shelter in place," the U.S. embassy said in a security alert.Two sources familiar with the situation at the airport could not confirm the reports of firing there, amid an exodus of Americans, their local allies and other foreigners.Secretary of State Antony Blinken had said earlier on Sunday that US embassy staff were ferried by helicopter from the diplomatic compound to the airport, about 5 km (3 miles) away on the northeastern side of the city."We're working to make sure that our personnel are safe and secure. We're relocating the men and women of our embassy to a location at the airport," Blinken told ABC news.Asked if the evacuation was evocative of the US departure from Vietnam in 1975, he said: "Let's take a step back. This is manifestly not Saigon."President Ashraf Ghani confirmed he has left the country, leaving it unclear how power would be transferred following the sweep across Afghanistan that brought the Taliban back to the capital two decades after it was overthrown by US-led forces.Sources told Reuters that most US staff were expected to be evacuated from Kabul in the coming day or two.A NATO official said all commercial flights had been suspended and only military aircraft were allowed to operate. The alliance said it was helping to keep the airport running.France and Germany, members of NATO, said on Sunday they were moving their diplomats to the airport and sending military transport planes to Kabul to evacuate their citizens and their Afghan helpers.'NOT SAIGON'A U.S. intelligence assessment earlier in the week had said Kabul could be encircled in 30 days and could fall to the Taliban within 90 days, but the insurgents captured most of Afghanistan's major cities in less than a week and entered the capital on Sunday.Some 4,200 people remained in the US embassy until Thursday, when the Taliban's rapid gains forced the Biden administration to begin flying in thousands of troops to help pull out many of the remaining diplomats.The deployment included an additional 1,000 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division, who President Joe Biden said on Saturday would help evacuate citizens and ensure an "orderly and safe" drawdown of U.S. military personnel.On Sunday, U.S. officials said they were weighing whether more troops were needed. Another 3,000 are on standby in Kuwait.Washington invested billions of dollars over four U.S. administrations in Afghan government forces, giving them advantages over the Taliban, but they were unable to defend the country in the face of the militants' advance, Blinken told CNN.The United States' original mission in Afghanistan, launched to oust al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, had been fulfilled, Blinken said, saying Washington had prevented further attacks by militants harbored by the Taliban.But Biden has faced rising domestic criticism after sticking to the plan to withdraw, which was agreed under his Republican predecessor Donald Trump. On Saturday, Biden defended his decision, saying an "endless American presence in the middle of another country's civil conflict was not acceptable to me".Republican lawmaker Michael McCaul said a Taliban takeover would revive the threat to the United States."We are going to go back to a pre-9/11 state. A breeding ground for terrorism," he told CNN on Sunday.Biden met with his national security team on Sunday by secure videoconference from the presidential retreat at Camp David to hear updates on evacuations and the security situation, a White House official said.US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat like Biden, said at a news conference that the safety of U.S. personnel and of Afghans who supported the Americans should be Washington's top concern."Job number one is for us to bring back, first, all American personnel ... But second, all of the brave Afghans who helped our military, they have to be provided an exit to come to America," Schumer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-to-send-1-000-troops-to-help-in-evacuation-101629066460804.html
16-08-2021||World||Won with the judgment of their swords, guns: Ghani flees as Taliban take Kabul||Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said Sunday after fleeing the country that the Taliban had won, as the militants entered Kabul -- nearly 20 years after they were ousted from power by a US-led invasion.Ghani left as the insurgents closed in on the capital, before ultimately entering the city and taking over the presidential palace, sealing a nationwide military victory in just 10 days.The Taliban have carried out a lightning sweep of the country, with government forces collapsing without the support of the US military, which is finalising its withdrawal in alignment with an August 31 deadline set by President Joe Biden.The insurgents' imminent takeover triggered fear and panic in Kabul among residents fearful of the group's hardline brand of Islam, which it imposed during its 1996-2001 rule."The Taliban have won with the judgement of their swords and guns, and are now responsible for the honour, property and self-preservation of their countrymen," Ghani said in a statement posted to Facebook, his first since fleeing."They are now facing a new historical test. Either they will preserve the name and honour of Afghanistan or they will give priority to other places and networks," he added, saying he left to prevent a "flood of bloodshed".Ghani did not say where he had travelled to, but leading Afghan media group Tolo news suggested he had gone to Tajikistan.'Ensure security'After initially ordering fighters not to enter the capital, a Taliban spokesman confirmed the Islamist insurgents had entered several districts in Kabul to "ensure security."Three senior Taliban sources also told AFP that their fighters had taken control of the presidential palace and were holding a meeting on security in the capital.Fighters inside the palace said they had been "victorious," in footage aired on Al-Jazeera."The former Afghan president has left the nation, leaving the people to this situation," Abdullah Abdullah, who heads the peace process, said in a video on his Facebook page.Ghani's departure from office was one of the key demands of the Taliban in months of peace talks with the government, but he had stubbornly clung to power.The insurgents said they want a "peaceful transfer" within the next few days.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged the Taliban and all parties to "exercise restraint" and said that the rights of women and girls, who suffered under the previous Taliban regime, be protected.The UN also said the Security Council would meet over Afghanistan on Monday.Mass evacuation effortThere are fears of a security vacuum in Kabul as thousands of police and other armed services members have abandoned their posts, uniforms, and even weapons.The United States began moving its citizens and Afghan staff to Kabul airport, with the help of thousands of troops deployed to the capital to assist with the evacuation.A US defense official said several hundred embassy employees had already been evacuated from Afghanistan, and that the airport remained open to commercial flights.The US embassy said there had been "reports of the airport taking fire" but those were not immediately confirmed.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the Western alliance was working to keep the airport running "to facilitate and coordinate evacuations", as foreign nationals and Afghans converged on the facility to attempt to leave the country.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken nevertheless dismissed comparisons with the chaotic American departure from Saigon in 1975."The fact of the matter is this: We went to Afghanistan 20 years ago with one mission in mind," he said Sunday."That was to deal with the people that attacked us on 9/11. That mission has been successful."More US troopsThe scale and speed of the insurgents' advance have shocked Afghans and the US-led alliance that poured billions into the country over the past two decades.President Joe Biden ordered the deployment of an additional 1,000 US troops to help secure the evacuation of embassy employees and thousands of Afghans who worked for American forces and now fear Taliban reprisals.That brought the total expected in Kabul in the coming days to 6,000.Biden's decision to stick to his withdrawal timetable has come under increased scrutiny given the collapse of the Afghan armed forces, but he insisted there was no choice and he would not "pass this war" onto another president.IsolatedGhani's government was left completely isolated on Sunday after the insurgents overran the anti-Taliban northern stronghold of Mazar-i-Sharif and the eastern city of Jalalabad.Like with most of the other captured cities, the seizure of power came after government forces surrendered or retreated.Videos posted on pro-Taliban social media accounts showed the group's heavily armed fighters in cities across the country, waving white flags and greeting locals.In Kabul, many resident were already resigned to the Taliban taking power."My only wish is that their return leads to peace. That is all we want," said Kabul shopkeeper Tariq Nezami.For the tens of thousands who have sought refuge in Kabul in recent weeks, the overwhelming mood was one of apprehension and fear."I am worried there will be a lot of fighting here," one doctor who arrived with his 35-strong family from Kunduz told AFP, asking not to be named."I would rather return home, where I know it has stopped."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/won-with-the-judgment-of-their-swords-guns-ghani-flees-as-taliban-take-kabul-101629065858093.html
16-08-2021||World||Commercial flights suspended from Kabul airport||Afghanistan’s embattled president left the country Sunday, joining thousands of his fellow citizens and foreigners in a stampede fleeing the advancing Taliban and signaling the end of a 20-year Western experiment aimed at remaking the country.The Taliban fanned out across the capital, and an official with the militant group said it would soon announce the creation of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan from the presidential palace in Kabul. That was the name of the country under Taliban rule before the militants were ousted by U.S.-led forces after the 9/11 attacks. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media.The Al-Jazeera news network later aired footage showing a group of Taliban fighters inside the presidential palace.The city was gripped by panic, with helicopters racing overhead throughout the day to evacuate personnel from the US Embassy. Smoke rose near the compound as staff destroyed important documents, and the American flag was lowered. Several other Western missions also prepared to pull their people out.Afghans fearing that the Taliban could reimpose the kind of brutal rule that all but eliminated women’s rights rushed to leave the country, lining up at cash machines to withdraw their life savings. The desperately poor — who had left homes in the countryside for the presumed safety of the capital — remained in parks and open spaces throughout the city.Though the Taliban had promised a peaceful transition, the US Embassy suspended operations and warned Americans late in the day to shelter in place and not try to get to the airport.Commercial flights were suspended after sporadic gunfire erupted at the airport, according to two senior US military officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations. Evacuations continued on military flights, but the halt to commercial traffic closed off one of the last routes available for Afghans fleeing the country.Still, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken rejected comparisons to the US pullout from Vietnam, as many watched in disbelief at the sight of helicopters landing in the embassy compound to take diplomats to a new outpost at Kabul International Airport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/commercial-flights-suspended-from-kabul-airport-101629054363217.html
16-08-2021||World||Explained: What does Taliban mean? Who are their leaders and what do they want?||With the second- and third-largest cities of Afghanistan having fallen to the Taliban in the last 24 hours, the control of insurgents over the war-torn country looks imminent even as the international community has asserted that they won’t recognise any government imposed by military force.The Taliban, which was ousted by US forces in 2001, now controls over half of the provincial capitals and is gradually encircling Afghanistan’s national capital Kabul, a city whose fall will signal a complete control of the Islamist fundamentalist group over the country. In their latest blitz, the Taliban fighters have reportedly taken control of Logar province, which is about 80 kilometres away from the capital.Amid deteriorating situation, the United States and Britain are deploying thousands of troops, only to evacuate their citizens before Washington officially declares the end of its two-decades-long war. The Indian mission in Kabul has also issued separate security advisories over the past few weeks, urging its citizens to leave Afghanistan as soon as possible on the earliest available commercial flight options.The United States has expressed concerns that the hardline Islamist group could topple the Ashraf Ghani-led government within three months, according to a US media report, which would see the return of the Taliban at the helm after nearly two decades.Also Read | Taliban near gates of Kabul as embassies prepare for evacuationsWho are the Taliban?In 1994, Mullah Mohammad Omar founded the Taliban with dozens of followers to challenge the rampant crime and corruption during the civil war. Taliban literally means “students” in Pashto, a reference to the founding members being the students of Mullah Mohammad Omar.The group originally drew members from the so-called “mujahideen” fighters who pushed the erstwhile USSR forces out of Afghanistan in the 1980s. It then went on to take control of most parts of the country by 1996 and ruled for about five years until the group was uprooted by the US forces in 2001. Mullah Mohammad Omar went into hiding after US-backed forces toppled the group.The hardline Islamist movement has since been fighting against the Western troops to regain control of Afghanistan.Who are the main leaders of the Taliban?Haibatullah Akhundzada, the Islamic legal scholar, is the Taliban's supreme leader who holds final authority over the group's political, religious, and military affairs, according to news agency Reuters. He took over the leadership after his predecessor, Akhtar Mansour, was killed in a US drone strike near the Afghan-Pakistan border in 2016.Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar heads the political office of the Taliban and is part of the team negotiating for a political settlement with various stakeholders in Doha. While the Afghan government has reportedly offered a deal to end violence in Afghanistan, Baradar is yet to respond as the Taliban continues its offensive back home.Believed to be in his early 30s, Mullah Omar’ son Yaqoob oversees the military operations of the Taliban. Yaqoob was seen as a successor of Mansour but he himself proposed the name of Akhundzada because of his young age and lack of experience in the battlefield, reported Reuters citing a Taliban commander.Also Read | Kabul in Taliban’s cross-hairs make Doha peace talks redundantWhat do they want?The Taliban, which grew in popularity in its initial days because of its promise to curb crime and corruption, later became notorious for brutally imposing their harsh version of Sharia. The girls and women of Afghanistan particularly bore the brunt of the Taliban regime, which banned them from schools and workplaces. Reports suggest that the group has resorted to its old tactics of oppressing women in the name of a “genuine Islamic system.” The Taliban has again promised to restore peace and security to its followers while hundreds of thousands of civilians get displaced fearing persecution.So, what happens now?According to an analysis published in The Washington Post, the Taliban tactics suggest their interest in seizing border crossing and contested territories during its previous rule. “Taking control of these areas might enable the Taliban to repress its political opponents while generating tens of millions in revenue before the end of the year,” the report says, indicating the group taking the control back from the elected Afghan government in coming days.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-does-taliban-mean-who-are-their-leaders-and-what-do-they-want-101628873902226.html
16-08-2021||India||Taliban must ensure soil not used by terror groups: India||India said on Monday that Afghanistan’s neighbours and the region would feel safer if Afghan soil isn’t used by terror groups to attack any other country as the UN Security Council debated the situation in the war-torn country following a Taliban takeover. Most of the 15 permanent and non-permanent members of the Security Council said the Taliban must ensure the territory of Afghanistan is not used by groups such as al-Qaeda and Islamic State. They called on the Taliban to ensure the security of foreign missions and humanitarian organisations during the second meeting on Afghanistan within 10 days under the Indian presidency of the UN body. However, remarks by the representatives of Russia and China hinted at a greater willingness to engage with the Taliban, who entered Kabul on Sunday after the civilian government collapsed as President Ashraf Ghani fled the country. Russia’s envoy to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, singled out Iran as an important regional player that could work with the “extended troika”, which includes Pakistan. India’s ambassador to the UN, TS Tirumurti, noted the situation in Afghanistan had dramatically changed since the last Security Council meeting 10 days ago, and was of “great concern” to New Delhi. He reiterated India’s call for respecting the rights of Afghan women, children and minorities, and added that a “broader representation would help the arrangement gain more acceptability and legitimacy”. “The current situation in Afghanistan has numerous challenges. However, there are a few opportunities. If there is a zero tolerance for terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and it is ensured that the territory of Afghanistan is not used by terrorist groups to threaten or attack any other country, then Afghanistan’s neighbours and the region would feel safer,” he said. Tirumurti noted that Afghan men, women and children are living in a constant state of fear amid increasing violations of their fundamental rights, and said: “We hope that the situation stabilises soon, and the parties concerned address the humanitarian and security issues. We also hope that there is an inclusive dispensation which represents all sections of Afghan society.” The world community and the Security Council should ensure an immediate cessation of violence and contain any possible crisis, and countries should rise above partisan interests to support Afghans to achieve peace, stability and security, he said. Recalling India’s contributions to the development of Afghanistan, Tirumurti said the country had ongoing development projects in all of the 34 Afghan provinces in critical areas such as power, water supply, road connectivity and healthcare. Russian envoy Nebenzia said Kabul had been “quickly abandoned by the country’s leader” and widespread bloodshed had been avoided as the Taliban entered the Afghan capital on Sunday. “Currently, we believe there is no point in panicking... Russia will interact with the Taliban irrespective of the evolving situation and their specific actions,” he added. Referring to Russia’s “extended troika” group that includes the US, China and Pakistan, Nebenzia said: “We believe that an important role could be played by Iran as well here.” Chinese deputy permanent representative Geng Shuang noted that some Security Council members desired a greater role to be played by Afghanistan’s neighbours, and, in an apparent reference to Pakistan, said: “We learnt that some regional countries and Afghanistan’s neighbours had made a request to participate in today’s meeting. It is regrettable that their requests were not granted.” Pakistan’s efforts to join both the Security Council meetings did not meet with success, with the body’s members turning down the country’s request. Geng further noted that the Taliban had said the war in Afghanistan has ended and that the group will negotiate to establish “an open and inclusive Islamic government” and take “responsible actions” for the safety of Afghans and foreign missions. He hoped the Taliban will unite with all parties and ethnic groups to establish a broad and inclusive political structure for lasting peace. Both Geng and Nebenzia also referred to threats posed to their countries by terror groups based in Afghanistan, such as Islamic State, al-Qaeda and ETIM, but made no mention of organisations such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed that pose concerns for India. US permanent representative Linda Thomas-Greenfield called on all parties to prevent terrorism and to ensure Afghanistan “cannot ever, ever again be a base for terrorism”, while the UK representative noted that the Taliban had pledged at Doha to engage in talks in good faith but “their actions on the ground have betrayed that promise”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taliban-must-ensure-soil-not-used-by-terror-groups-india-101629138387324.html

Challenging the norm under the Kerala Registration of Births and Deaths Rules, 1970, which makes it mandatory to mention the father's details, the woman said in her petition that she cannot disclose the father's name on grounds that the identity of the sperm donor is kept anonymous and the information has not been disclosed even to her. The woman also appealed to the court that the requirement violates her right of privacy, liberty and dignity.Upon hearing the plea of the woman, the court observed that rights of a single woman to conceive through ART procedure was recognised and accepted in the country and contended that in such procedures, the identity of the sperm donor cannot be disclosed except in circumstances as may be compelled for, under law."It falls within the realm of the 'right of privacy'. The said right has also been recognised in the guidelines for ART clinics, with very little exceptions. Under the circumstances, there is no rhyme or reason in requiring the petitioner to provide the name of the father in the form prescribed for registration of birth and death,” the court said, according to news agency PTI.The Kerala high court also agreed with the petitioner in her argument that leaving the column regarding the details of father as blank — and issuing certificates of birth or death by leaving the space provided therein regarding the details of the father as blank — affects the right of dignity of the mother as well as the child.The court said while the concept of conceiving through ART was alien to India a few decades back till the first 'test tube baby' was born, "by the passage of time, evolution of techniques, change in lifestyle and personal choices recognised by the Rule of Law, appropriate modifications, additions and alterations need to be made in statutes, rules and the forms prescribed thereunder”, as it directed the government to provide appropriate forms for registration of births and deaths of children born through such procedures.However, the court said applicants can be asked to furnish an affidavit they are single parent who conceived through the ART procedure and produce copies of medical record, to prevent misuse of such forms for settling scores in 'family feuds'.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/asking-father-s-details-for-ivf-born-child-harms-women-s-privacy-kerala-court-101629133514808.html
16-08-2021||India||Odisha, Andhra in fresh face-off over disputed border village||The ongoing border dispute between Andhra Pradesh and Odisha over the contentious Kotia Gram Panchayat in Koraput district resulted in a fresh conflict on Monday, after the local administration foiled an attempt by Andhra Pradesh MLAs to host a series of political events in a village under the panchayat.Officials in Koraput said MLA of Salur assembly constituency Rajan Dora was due to host several political and cultural events at Phatusineri village under Kotia Gram Panchayat on Monday. The Project Director of Integrated Tribal Development Agency at Parvatipuram was supposed to join the programme. But before the MLA could start his programme, local politicians as well district administration and police personnel were deployed at the spot. The political leaders led by former Koraput MP Jayram Pangi as well as Congress leader Taraprasad Bahinipati and BJD MLA Pritam Padhi opposed the events.BJP leader Jayram Pangi who helped the police and district administration to keep the intruders away said, Kotia is an integral part of Odisha. “I want to send a strong warning to the Andhra Pradesh government that they will never be successful in taking over Kotia panchayat,” he said. It is an integral part of Odisha and nobody can deny it.”Congress MLA Taraprasad Bahinipati said all the political parties in Koraput are supporting the state government burying their political differences. “We are one for the cause of our motherland. We have decided that all MLAs will donate ₹1 lakh for the development of the panchayat,” he said. Bahinipati also who joined BJD and BJP leaders in sloganeering against Andhra Pradesh.Koraput district collector Abdaal M Akhtar said the district administration received information that some political people from Andhra Pradesh are trying to organise cultural programmes at Kotia.“We deployed police personnel at the spot to ward off any potential law and order situation. We are in touch with the Vizianagaram district administration. Since the issue concerning Kotia is already sub-judice, we asked them to resolve the dispute in a peaceful manner. Any unilateral action on the ground will never be acceptable for Odisha,” he said.It was in Phatusineri village under Kotia Gram Panchayat where the AP government in February this year had conducted panchayat polls despite Odisha and Andhra being locked in a legal battle over territorial control of the area since early 60s. The Kotia Gram Panchayat has 28 revenue villages; Odisha mistakenly did not survey 21 villages during its formation in 1936. At the time of creation of Andhra Pradesh in the year 1955, those 21 villages were also not surveyed by Andhra resulting in perpetual dispute over these bordering villages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-andhra-in-fresh-face-off-over-disputed-border-village-101629132386900.html

Sharma’s meetings in New Delhi will focus on India’s role in helping to ensure the success of the climate change summit to be hosted by the UK in Glasgow in November. With fewer than 100 days to go until the summit, Sharma’s in-person visit represents the UK’s commitment to raise global ambition on climate action for a balanced and inclusive outcome at COP26, the UK high commission said in a statement. Sharma said: “India has a vital role to play as the world comes together in Glasgow to demonstrate renewed action under the Paris Agreement. India’s leadership, including through the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), is hugely important as we look to build global resilience ahead of COP26 and beyond.” All countries, including the UK and India, have an opportunity to build back greener from the Covid-19 pandemic, and providing climate resilient jobs that also promote economic growth and will lead to a “green industrial revolution that also makes financial sense”, he added. During his meetings with key stakeholders, Sharma is expected to point to the role India can play at the summit “through profiling its ambitious domestic plans and by joining the growing number of countries who have updated their 2030 emissions targets under the Paris Agreement”, the statement added. The UK has called on all G20 countries to sign up to net zero, set out clear plans to cut emissions by 2030, and commit to ending coal power, transitioning to electric vehicles, and restoring nature, with the richest nations providing financial support to the rest of the planet to go green. The UK and India currently work closely together on issues such as research and innovation for a clean energy transition and to improve global resilience through bodies such as ISA, CDRI and Green Growth Equity Fund. Sharma holds the post of minister of state at the UK Cabinet Office and this is his second visit to India in 2021. He is expected to meet environment and climate change minister Bhupender Yadav and power and new and renewable energy minister RK Singh. UK high commissioner Alex Ellis described the COP26 summit as “our last best chance to set the world on the path towards a global warming limit of 1.5 degrees”. He added, “India is already taking impressive action, for example on renewables. With most of the infrastructure that India will need by 2040 yet to be built, it can lead the way in new clean technology and infrastructure.” The UK will host the UN climate change conference in partnership with Italy. The UK is already setting an example on climate action with a legally binding target to cut emissions to net zero by 2050, and it has committed to doubling its international climate finance to at least £11.6 billion over the next five years to help developing countries to take action. Climate is one of the pillars of the India-UK 2030 roadmap, and the two countries co-chair CDRI and promote disaster resilient infrastructure planning, development, policy and financing across the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cop26-chief-alok-sharma-begins-3-day-visit-india-s-role-at-climate-summit-on-radar-101629128066282.html
16-08-2021||India||Mansukh Mandaviya announces special package for Kerala to fight Covid-19 pandemic||Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Monday announced a special package of ₹267.35 crore for Kerala to strengthen its health infrastructure to fight the Covid-19 pandemic effectively. Sent to the state in the wake of a heavy virus caseload, the Union minister met chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and health minister Veena George and officials in the state capital. “We will provide all possible help to the state. Besides this amount, ₹one crore will be made available to each district to create a medicine pool. The Centre will also ensure creation of a centre of excellence that caters to telemedicine facilities in every district,” the minister tweeted after his marathon talks with the CM and others. He also said the state will be given top priority in allocation of vaccine. “Had an intensive meeting with the CM and health minister and officials. The Centre is committed to help the state. For prioritising health of children, a paediatric ICU will be established in each district hospital with 10 kilo-litre liquid oxygen tank facility,” he tweeted. Later a senior health official, who did not want to be named, said talks were fruitful and the central minister was studious and aware of problems being faced by the state. He said the CM’s office will release details of the conversation later. Kerala also raised its long- pending demand for an AIMS in the state. For more than a month now, the state has been reporting half of the total caseload of the country and its test positivity rate is four times higher than the national average. With three per cent of the nation’s population, the state has been contributing more than half of the total cases and its case trajectory has baffled medical experts and others. Worried, the Union government had rushed an experts’ team to the state in the first week of August and it visited eight districts during their week-long tour. Minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan, also from Kerala, said two days back that the Centre was worried about the pandemic situation in the state.

An earlier notification had said malls would remain open till 10 in the night every day and only individuals, including staff, with vaccination certificates of both doses against the virus and a valid identity card would be allowed in.Now, those below 18 years of age for whom the vaccination drive has not yet been started can visit the malls with age proofs to be shown at entry points, according to the new government order issued under "break the chain" guidelines."Since vaccination for the population below l8 years has not yet started, all children below 18 years of age need to show documents for their age proof at entry points of malls," the letter reads.In Mumbai, the civic body had announced earlier in the day that all playgrounds, gardens, beaches and seafronts will remain open for the public from 6am to 10pm.The new relaxations came a day after the Maharashtra government allowed fully vaccinated citizens to travel by Mumbai local trains after a gap of four months. This was one of the key demands of the people of Maharashtra as only government employees and those engaged in essential services were granted permission to travel in local trains.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had said on August 8 to keep the economic cycle moving, the government is imposing certain criteria and restrictions to allow ordinary passengers to travel locally.The pandemic situation has been slowly improving in the state, one of the worst affected in the country. At its peak, Maharashtra was registering more than 60,000 daily cases. On Monday, the figure was 4,145, while the capital city of Mumbai saw 195 new infections during the day. Fatalities from the viral disease have also fallen massively with 100 patients losing their lives to the infection on Monday in the state.The authorities have, so far, inoculated a large number of beneficiaries in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-those-below-18-yrs-can-now-visit-malls-in-maha-with-age-proof-101629125103967.html

16-08-2021||India||Centre gets 4-week extension on framing ex-gratia for Covid-19 deaths||The Supreme Court on Monday allowed a month’s extension to the Centre for framing ex-gratia compensation for Covid-19 deaths but asked the Government to indicate within two weeks steps taken to issue death certificate guidelines in Covid-19 cases and a national insurance scheme for disaster-related deaths, that formed part of the Court’s order passed on June 30.A bench of Justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah said, “The time for framing of guidelines for ex-gratia compensation under Section 12(iii) of the Disaster Management Act 2005 is extended by four weeks. However, the Centre shall place on record its response setting out compliance effected of other guidelines.” The bench posted the matter after two weeks.By its June 30 order, the Court had held that the government was required to pay ex-gratia compensation for Covid-19 deaths since Covid-19 was declared a notified disaster under the 2005 Act. The order came on two PILs filed by advocates Gaurav Kumar Bansal and Reepak Kansal who said that in case of death on account of a notified disaster, a sum of ₹4 lakh had been fixed as ex-gratia payment by the Ministry of Home Affairs by a letter of April 8, 2015. However, the Court did not fix the quantum of compensation but left it to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to fix the amount while framing the guidelines within six weeks.As the period of six weeks expired by mid-August, the Centre moved an application for extension of time saying, “The exercise to frame appropriate guidelines for payment of ex-gratia payment to the victims of Covid-19 disaster under Section 12(iii) of the DMA is in active consideration of the NDMA and going on. This exercise, though at an active advance stage requires a little more in-depth examination before the same is finalized and implemented.” The Centre was of the view that any “accelerated formulation may result into undesirable results” and if four additional weeks are available, NDMA can come out with a “comprehensive and robust formulation” on ex-gratia compensation.Having gone through the application, the bench observed, “We have no difficulty to extend time. But a number of directions had been issued by us. There is no mention about those orders in your application.”Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati appearing for the Centre informed the Court that a suitable affidavit shall be filed bringing on record the steps taken pursuant to the Court’s judgment.The June 30 judgment came as a landmark decision where the Court extended a helping hand to more than four lakh people who died due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Apart from compensation, two other directions were passed by the Court, which included issuance of simplified guidelines for issuance of death certificate stating the exact cause of death as “Death due to COVID-19”. Such guidelines, according to the Court, were to consider a person who has died within two to three months after he was found COVID-positive, to be also included as having “died due to COVID-19”. In the event, persons who have already received death certificates wished to make amends to their death document, the Court directed the Centre to provide a suitable remedy for family members of the deceased to get the same corrected.In addition, the judgment asked the Centre to take appropriate steps in line with the recommendations of the Fifteenth Finance Commission providing for a National Insurance Scheme for disaster-related deaths. As per the Finance Commission, this could work as a Social Protection Scheme without increasing the administrative burden on the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-gets-4-week-extension-on-framing-ex-gratia-for-covid-19-deaths-101629119545503.html
16-08-2021||India||Sushmita Dev’s resignation hasn’t come as surprise to Assam Congress||Former member of parliament from Silchar, Assam, Sushmita Dev officially resigned from the Congress on Sunday and sought good wishes from party chief Sonia Gandhi for her “new chapter of public service”. She also resigned from the post of All India Mahila Congress President on August 15. But this did not happen overnight, she had hinted at this on July 26 during a press conference in Silchar. Recently when her Twitter account was blocked for a while, she unofficially said, “Wait for 2-3 days, something big is coming.” The move to quit Congress started during the Assam assembly election this year when Dev and then APCC president Ripun Bora disagreed on seat distribution for Barak Valley region of the state. According to Dev, out of 15 seats in Barak Valley, APCC president wanted to give 8 seats to Congress, allowing alliance partner All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) to contest from the rest. Later, Congress contested from 11 seats winning in four of them. “If six to seven seats were given away in Barak Valley, why should grassroots level workers remain in Congress in tough times? I raised this question on behalf of each and every party worker in Barak Valley,” she said in March. She also hinted at her resignation just before the Assam-Mizoram conflict when she said, “I have already talked to Sonia ji regarding my decision to quit some big responsibilities in Congress party. My decision will be in public soon.”Also Read | Sushmita Dev joins TMC a day after quitting CongressShe pointed out that APCC did not give her proper respect during the state assembly elections. She said, “I am the kingmaker in Barak Valley and we have performed much better than the Brahmaputra Valley. In alliance with the AIUDF, we won 9 out of 15 seats in Barak Valley. Sonia Gandhi ji is happy with our performance, but APCC did not give our hard-fought win proper respect. Some APCC leaders treat us as if we are nobody. My family has contributed towards the party...We cannot continue serving like second class workers in the party.”She also said that some senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders were suggesting her to join their party before assembly election this year. “Some ministers tried to influence me to join the BJP before the election. Politics is a part of my life and I need to feel comfortable while taking decisions. I turned down their requests.”Congress leaders in Barak Valley are not surprised by Dev’s decision. Her childhood friend and former president of Silchar District Congress Committee, Tamal Kanti Banik, said, “We are not shocked...She chose her own career over her father’s legacy and the Congress itself...We are bit sad that a family (Santosh Mohan Dev’s family) which has almost five decade-long relationship with the Congress is no longer a part it.” APCC working president Kamalakhya Dey Purkayastha said, “Sushmita Dev was upset since disagreement on ticket distribution before the assembly election. I cannot support her decision of quitting. The Congress has given everything to her family -- from making her father a Union minister to selecting her as the president of All India Mahila Congress. I am yet to talk to her but I feel that she has preferred her career over the party.”He also said Dev’s absence won’t be a big factor. “During the Emergency in 1970s, the Congress was almost finished, but we came back stronger...We are going through another tough phase and this will also end. Sushmita Dev should have realised that a person’s absence doesn’t make [much of a] change because thousands of dedicated people are working for the party.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushmita-dev-s-resignation-hasn-t-come-as-surprise-to-assam-congress-101629118106462.html

Air India flight number 243 took off on time, a little after noon, Sunday, but the ground reality changed in just the two hours that the plane took to reach Afghanistan airspace. Just as the crew prepared for landing and the pilots tried to coordinate with Air Traffic Control, it got no reply. “Zero reply. We were just met with silence,’’ said one of the crew members who did not wish to be named. According to another, there was no other aircraft in the vicinity and the pilots had no choice but hold their descent into Kabul. In the meantime, other airlines were directing their pilots to turn around and not land in Kabul. Several airlines, including United Airlines and British Airways, stopped using Afghanistan on Sunday. Lufthansa, KLM and Air India stopped operations Monday, after the war-torn country’s civil aviation authority issued NOTAMs or notices to airmen, closing its airspace to all civilian flights. Also Read | In Afghanistan, the limits of Indian powerAI 243 stayed in the hold position for over an hour. It could do so for another few minutes. As one official, interviewed for this story said, “The flight had holding fuel for 10 to 12 minutes.” Unknown to the pilots, the Taliban had reached the gates of Kabul and were preparing to take over the Palace. That was also the time Afghan President Ashraf Ganai was preparing to flee. Would AI 243 be able to land and bring back Indians stranded in Kabul? The pilots were not sure. They could not have asked to land at a nearby airport. Their standard operating procedure required them to return to Delhi. An hour’s silence from the ATC is excruciatingly long. In that hour, American troops were operating their helicopters to evacuate their staff out of their embassy in Kabul. They were also helping President Ghani flee. The Taliban had made it clear: they were not willing to settle for an interim government. They had reached the outskirts of Kabul and were waiting to enter the Palace. After a long, one hour, the Americans took over the air traffic control and IA 243 finally got a reply: they could land but after the Americans had airlifted their envoys out of their embassy. The drama did not end after Air India finally managed to touch down on Kabul’s runway. The airport neither had ground handling staff nor security personnel. The flight needed to refuel for its journey back to Delhi. The fuel bowser driver was nowhere to be found. The turn-around flight took three hours to depart the Taliban-controlled country; but only after the Americans helped find a driver for the bowser and the Air India crew doubled up to safety check the passengers and their baggage. The last civilian flight finally landed in Delhi and the crew relaxed after a harrowing day but only after being grilled by senior management officers and officials from the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security. Their main worry: did anyone other than a passenger make it back on the last flight out of Kabul?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/werent-sure-will-be-able-to-bring-back-stranded-indians-ai-kabul-flight-crew-101629117205232.html

On July 11 this year, when Kejriwal had visited the state, he had announced 300 units of free electricity to the people in the state if AAP was elected to power in the hill state. Talking about replicating AAP’s Delhi model of governance in Uttarakhand, Kejriwal had said if the party comes to power, it will bring in major change in schools and health infrastructure. “Our leaders here are talking to youth, within a month or so, we will make a big announcement about employment for the state’s youth”, he had said. “Going to Uttarakhand tomorrow. Aam Aadmi Party will make an important announcement. It will prove to be a milestone in Uttarakhand’s progress and development,” he wrote in a post on Twitter.

Over the last eight to nine months or so, it has been attacking the ruling BJP on various issues including corruption, unemployment and health through various political events and on social media.

16-08-2021||India||‘Sonia Gandhi hasn’t got any letter from Sushmita Dev’: Randeep Surjewala||Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said on Monday that party president Sonia Gandhi has not received the resignation letter of Sushmita Dev, the former president of the Congress’ women’s wing. Calling Dev as a dedicated Congress worker, Surjewala said he tried calling her but her phone was switched off. “Congress president Sonia Gandhi has not received any letter from her. She’s mature enough to take her decisions, can’t comment until I speak with her,” Surjewala was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Dev, the daughter of late veteran Congress leader Santosh Mohan Dev, stepped down from the party and wrote to Sonia Gandhi saying she “cherished” her three decade -long association. “Madam, I thank you, personally, for the guidance and the opportunities you gave me. I value the enriching experience,” she said in her letter to Gandhi on Sunday but didn’t specify any reasons for her resignation.Sushmita Dev’s resignation intensifies the internal crisis in the Congress and it is very likely expected that several leaders or G-23 members will reiterate their demand for a major organisational revamp in the party. Senior leader and former Union minister Kapil Sibal, who is one of the G-23 members, reacted sharply to Dev’s exit and said the Congress was moving on with its eyes wide shut. “Sushmita Dev resigns from primary membership of our Party. While young leaders leave we ‘oldies’ are blamed for our efforts to strengthen it,” Sibal wrote on Twitter.On the other hand, Congress leader Manish Tewari said that Dev has to give a better explanation for her exit considering her long association with the party and its leaders.Though it has not been clear where Sushmita Dev will go from here on, people familiar with the development told Hindustan Times on Monday that she might join Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress (TMC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-hasn-t-got-any-letter-from-sushmita-dev-randeep-surjewala-101629096330942.html
16-08-2021||India||Ahead of 2022 assembly polls, BJP ministers embark on Jan Ashirwad Yatras in UP||Ahead of the 2022 assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, Union ministers from the state kicked off seven ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatras’ on Monday with the aim to spread awareness about achievements of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led governments at the Centre and the state while touring about 120 assembly segments and covering nearly 3500 kms. The mass connect drive comes about seven months before the crucial UP assembly elections.“We are working to ensure that all those who don’t have a roof on their heads get them by August 15, 2022. We will tell the people about it, update them on various initiatives and naturally would seek people’s blessings too as the yatra itself is named ‘Jan Ashirwad’,” said Kaushal Kishore, the Mohanlalganj MP, who is the Union minister of state for housing and urban affairs. He was referring to PM Awas Yojana (PMAY) which aims to construct 21.4 million houses in rural areas and 11.2 million units in urban areas by 2022. A Dalit by caste, Kishore started his yatra from Unnao and his yatra will culminate at Sitapur on August 18 after touching various assembly segments in Unnao, Rae Bareli and Barabanki. During the welcome function for Kishore, Ajay Mishra, the Lok Sabha MP from Lakhimpur Kheri and Union minister of state for home and Pankaj Choudhary, the Lok Sabha MP from Maharajganja and Union minister of state for finance, social distancing protocols were thrown to the winds and majority of the part workers were seen without face masks.“Abhi tak lagaye thhey, bas abhi hataye (I had it on all through, have just removed it),” said one of the cadres when asked about violation of the Covid containment protocols. Ajay Mishra, before embarking on his yatra from Sandila, Hardoi, said, “We will meet the masses and seek their blessings. Sensing people’s mood, we are confident that based on the various initiatives of our government and pro-people measures, we will form our own majority government [in the state].”Mishra’s yatra will pass through Hardoi, Lakhimpur, Bahraich, Gonda, Ayodhya before culminating at Ambedkar Nagar on August 19.Pankaj Choudhary said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always described himself as the pradhan sevak (chief servant) setting the template for us. Naturally, the yatra is aimed at connecting with the masses and seeking their blessings.”Choudhary’s yatra will move from Basti via Barabanki, Siddharthnagar and Ayodhya. It will conclude at Choudhary’s Lok Sabha constituency of Maharajganj in eastern Uttar Pradesh on August 18.Party leaders said these yatras were thought of after Prime Minister Narendra Modi was prevented by the Opposition from introducing the new ministers inducted into his cabinet on July 8 in the Lok Sabha.UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev said the party’s state general secretary and member of legislative council (MLC) Govind Narayan Shukla has been made in-charge of these yatras covering several religious cities, including Ayodhya, Mathura, Kashi (Varanasi) and Chitrakoot. BL Verma, minister of state for development of northeastern region and cooperation, will lead one of the seven yatras from Vrindavan, Mathura. Verma is the protégé of former UP chief minister Kalyan Singh. After covering Mathura and various assembly constituencies in Agra, Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddh Nagar and Bulandshahr, Verma’s yatra will conclude at Budaun on August 19.Union minister of state for law and justice SP Singh Baghel will start his yatra from Firozabad and conclude it in Mathura. On August 17, Union minister of state for micro, small and medium enterprises, Bhanu Pratap Verma will start his yatra from Lalitpur and reach Fatehpur on August 19 via Jhansi, Mahoba, Banda before it ends in Chitrakoot.BJP ally and Apna Dal (S) leader Anupriya Patel, the Union minister of state for commerce and industry, will start her yatra from Prayagraj on August 18 and it will end on August 19 in Mirzapur, her Lok Sabha constituency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-2022-polls-bjp-ministers-embark-on-jan-ashirwad-yatras-in-up-101629099324353.html

Two NOTAMs or notices to airmen – official notices containing essential information on flight operations – issued on Monday morning by the Afghanistan Civil Aviation Authority said the civilian side of Hamid Karzai International Airport or Kabul airport was “closed until further notice” and that Kabul’s airspace “has been released to the military”.The second NOTAM advised all “transit aircraft to reroute” and cautioned that “any transit through Kabul airspace will be uncontrolled”. Also Read | As Taliban take control of Afghanistan, a look at who’s who of the leadershipAn Air India spokesperson said the airspace over Afghanistan had been declared closed and no commercial aircraft could operate there. “Our scheduled flight to Kabul also cannot go,” the spokesperson added. The development came after thousands of US troops took over Kabul airport to ensure the evacuation of American diplomats, officials and citizens. There were reports of US troops firing in the air at the airport after thousands of Afghans seeking to flee the country walked on to the tarmac and began gathering in large numbers. There were reports of three people being killed by gunfire at the passenger terminal of Kabul airport, raising questions about the security of the facility despite the presence of US troopsKabul airport is currently the only way to leave the country as the Taliban have taken over all the important land border crossings with neighbouring countries such as Pakistan, Iran, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Air India, Emirates, FlyDubai, Pakistan International Airlines and Turkish Airlines are among the few airlines currently operating flights to Kabul. On Sunday, the scheduled Air India flight from New Delhi to Kabul had to hover over the Afghan capital for almost an hour as the sudden advance of the Taliban to the city created chaos for flight operations and there was no clearance from air traffic control for the aircraft to land. The flight returned late in the evening with 129 passengers, including officials and security personnel from the Indian embassy and Afghans fleeing their country. Indian officials had said the Air India flights will continue to operate, though there was no clarity when the restrictions on Kabul airport would be lifted. The Indian side has already put military and civilian aircraft on standby for special flights to evacuate all Indian nationals from Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sudden-closure-of-kabul-airport-throws-schedules-of-remaining-flights-into-disarray-101629096984056.html

The doodle depicted Chauhan donning a white sari with a brown stripe at the edges. She is shown holding a pen and paper in the illustration in a contemplative pose. The doodle also shows young Jhansi ki Rani on her white horse in the background. On the right side, the illustrator also drew a huge crowd of satyagrahis carrying banners.Born in 1904, Chauhan hailed from the Allahabad district, now known as Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh. She initially studied in the Crosthwaite Girls' School in Allahabad and cleared the middle-school examination in 1919. In 1921, Chauhan joined the Non-Cooperation Movement led by Mahatma Gandhi. She was jailed twice for her involvement in the protests against the British in 1923 and 1942.Chauhan's writing highlighted the struggles and hardships of Indian women. She has also written about "gender and caste discrimination" in society. At the time of the independence movement, Chauhan wrote a lot of poetry to boost the morale of the countrymen. Subhadra Kumari Chauhan is widely known for her iconic poem on Rani Laxmibai, the queen of Jhansi. Besides Jhansi ki Rani, her notable works include 'Khilonewala', 'Tridhara', 'Mukul' and 'Yeh Kadamb Ka Ped'.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/google-doodle-celebrates-poet-subhadra-kumari-chauhan-on-her-117th-birthday-101629094024679.html
16-08-2021||India||'Congress moves on with eyes wide shut', says Sibal after Sushmita Dev resigns||Shortly after Sushmita Dev resigned from the Congress, the party's senior leader Kapil Sibal accused the leadership of moving on with "eyes wide shut". Sibal is one of the 23 leaders (called G-23) who wrote an open letter to party president Sonia Gandhi last year demanding sweeping changes in the Congress."Sushmita Dev Resigns from primary membership of our Party. While young leaders leave we ‘oldies’ are blamed for our efforts to strengthen it. The Party moves on with:Eyes Wide Shut," the Rajya Sabha MP said on Twitter.Dev sent her resignation letter to Sonia Gandhi on Sunday saying she is resigning from the primary membership of the party, but did not give any specific reason.In her letter to Gandhi, Dev said she was beginning a "new chapter in my life of public service". Dev has also changed her Twitter bio to former member of the party and former head of Congress' women's wing.Dev is the daughter of late veteran Congressman Santosh Mohan Dev and came to Parliament for the first time in 2014 from the family seat of Silchar in Assam.With his comments, Sibal has once again highlighted the crisis brewing in the Congress party. It is facing troubles on multiple fronts.Congress has been functioning without a full-time president - Sonia Gandhi is the working president of the party. Sibal and the other 22 Congress leaders had demanded elections to appoint a new president. Rahul Gandhi, who took over as Congress president, resigned after the party's second consecutive loss to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2019 General Elections.Then there is the issue of defection. In June, two-term Lok Sabha MP and former Union minister Jitin Prasada joined the BJP, more than a year after Jyotiraditya Scindia switched sides. The Congress has also been facing trouble in states like Rajasthan, where former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot rebelled against the state leadership. The party's high command has been making several attempts to placate Pilot.It has, for the time being, handled the situation in Punjab where Navjot Sidhu revolted against chief minister Amarinder Singh. But the rumbling is a matter of concern for the party which is looking to retain power in Punjab in next year's assembly election. In 2017, the Congress, under Singh, won a comfortable majority, displacing the BJP-Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) government in the process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-moves-on-with-eyes-wide-shut-says-sibal-after-sushmita-dev-resigns-101629089802709.html

16-08-2021||India||Patnaik relaunches flagship healthcare scheme with enhanced cover for women||Ahead of next year’s panchayat polls in Odisha, the Naveen Patnaik government on Sunday relaunched Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana, its flagship health scheme offering health cover up to ₹5 lakh annually to each family and ₹10 lakh cover, up from ₹7 lakh, to every woman in the family.Announcing the relaunch on the 75th Independence Day, Patnaik said 35 million people in the state’s 9.6 million families will be provided smart health cards under the scheme that aims to transform the health service delivery system.“People of Odisha are my family. The news of people selling land, jewellery or taking children out of school to manage [illness] treatment costs pains me. Therefore I decided that this type of distress must go. People should get hassle-free quality treatment at best available healthcare facilities. So, Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana was redesigned to provide Smart Health Cards that will double up as debit cards for withdrawal of a certain amount. The move will usher in a new era in the state’s health sector,” said Patnaik.9.6 million families in the state will get two chip-based cards carrying the beneficiary’s name and a 12-digit unique registration number. The cards will be distributed first in Malkangiri, Balangir, Sundargarh, Mayurbhanj and Gajapati districts before covering the remaining 26 districts by November.As per the first component of BSKY, the entire population of the state is being provided free treatment in government hospitals in the state. The second component will extend cashless health coverage to smartcard holders in more than 200 empanelled hospitals in the country. No document will be required for cashless healthcare services in government hospitals. However, the beneficiaries will have to produce the smartcard or food security card at the empanelled private hospitals for availing cashless care up to the limit.Odisha started the scheme in August 2018 to lessen the out of pocket (OOP) expenses which were very high as per the national health accounts estimate for 2016-17, released by the Union health ministry. It revealed that OOP expenditure made up 76% of the total health expenditure in Odisha and around 70% of OOP expenditure was on drugs and diagnostics services. The scheme allowed convergence of erstwhile Rastriya Swasthya Bima Yojana, Biju Krushak Kalyan Yojana and Odisha State Treatment Fund without anypremium contribution by the beneficiary or insurance intermediary.While all government hospitals provide free services under BSKY, the scheme has also empanelled 197 private hospitals across 30 districts, which were previously empanelled with various schemes like Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), Biju Krushak Kalyan Yojana (BKKY) or Odisha State Treatment Fund (OSTF). The state government has also empanelled some top hospitals out of the state.An analysis of the scheme between February 2019 and February 2020, done by researchers Sudha Chandrashekar, Dhananjay, Sarit Kumar Rout, Upasona Ghosh, Vivek Panwar and N Devadasan revealed that the scheme received 17,010 pre-authorization requests, of which 97.7% were approved. Secondary level hospitalisations were a major part of the claims. The most sought after speciality treatment in private empanelled hospitals was in ophthalmology 35.58 % and general surgery 22.42% departments and the most common procedure within the specialties was cataract, haemodialysis, deliveries, hysterectomy and fissurectomy.The average number of claims made per month under the scheme is 3,425 and the average length of hospitalisation was 1.62 days with an average claim size of ₹7,396.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naveen-patnaik-relaunches-flagship-healthcare-scheme-with-enhanced-cover-for-women-101629087083345.html

16-08-2021||India||Meghalaya home minister quits amid stir||Meghalaya home minister Lahkmen Rymbui on Sunday resigned from his post amid vandalism and arson over the police encounter of a top militant last week, even as the state government announced a curfew in Shillong and suspended internet services in at least four districts to contain the situation.In his letter to chief minister Conrad Sangma, Rymbui expressed shock over the protests and proposed a judicial enquiry into the death of banned Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council general secretary, Cherish Starfield Thangkhiew, who was killed in a police encounter on August 13.“I hereby express shock at the incident where (L) Chesterfield Thangkhiew was killed following the raid of police at his residence exceeding the lawful tenets of the law. Considering the gravity of the situation, I would request you to relieve the Home (Police) Department from me with immediate effect,” he said.Thangkhiew, who surrendered in 2018, was suspected to be the mastermind behind a spate of IED attacks, police said.According to the director-general of police R Chandranathan, he allegedly attacked police with a knife when his home was being raided, provoking a retaliatory shot in which he was killed.Earlier in the day, hundreds of Thangkhiew’s supporters carried black flags as the militant’s body was being taken to the cemetery. Police said the protesters vandalised government vehicles and set a police vehicle afire in Shillong’s Jaiaw area.A curfew in the Shillong Agglomeration area of the state capital was imposed from 8 pm on Sunday till 5 am on August 17.

16-08-2021||India||Bolster collective power of small farmers: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day speech said his government’s agriculture policies were pivoted to meet the needs of small farmers, who must be turned into “pride of the nation”.Modi said that it was high time the country needed to apply “scientific research and suggestions” to the agriculture sector to provide food security to the nation and to increase food production. He also said that the country must increase the collective power of small farmers.“Our mantra is ‘Chhota kisan bane desh ki shaan’ (small farmers must become the pride of the nation) . It’s our dream. In years to come, we’ve to further increase the collective strength of small farmers of the country, we will have to provide them new facilities. ‘Kisan rail’ runs on more than 70 rail routes of the country today.”Small farmers have less than two hectares of land. Additionally, farm holdings are getting smaller and smaller in villages with rise in population and division in families, he said during his speech.“Now, keeping these farmers in mind, farm policies and reforms are being made,” the PM said, adding that schemes like PM-Kisan and Fasal Bima Yojana will strengthen these cultivators.Modi also announced that the government would fortify the rice distributed to the poor through different schemes such as midday meals to improve nutritional outcomes.“Malnutrition and lack of micro-nutrients are affecting the growth of poor children. Looking at this, it has been decided to fortify the rice given to the poor via different government schemes,” the PM said.The PM’s focus on small farmers during his I-Day speech comes amid a nearly year-long agitation by farmers, especially from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh etc, against three agricultural laws enacted last year in September. Talks between the central government and farmer unions have stalled since they last met on January 22; the two sides have held 11 meetings thus far. In the January 22 meeting, the unions rejected the government’s proposal to put the laws on hold for up to 18 months. The Centre has repeatedly stated it won’t take back the reforms.Modi also said his government would launch an e-commerce platform for trading of the products made by women self-help groups (SHGs) in villages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bolster-collective-power-of-small-farmers-modi-101629062447093.html
16-08-2021||India||‘India fighting terror, expansionism’||In his 88-minute Independence Day address from the Red Fort on Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi drew the nation’s attention to the challenges India faces from terrorism and expansionism, in a veiled reference to Pakistan-sponsored terrorism and China‘s expansionist policy in Ladakh and its resolve to strengthen the capabilities of the armed forces.The PM said India was fighting terrorism and expansionism with courage, and the government would take all steps to strengthen the capabilities of the armed forces. “Today, the world is looking at India from a new perspective and this vision has two important aspects...One terrorism and the other expansionism. India is fighting these two challenges and responding to them astutely and with great courage,” the PM said.He said that the 2016 surgical strikes and the 2019 air strikes against terror pads in Pakistan sent a strong message to the country’s enemies about the emergence of a ‘new India’ and its resolve to take tough decisions. “India has given a stern signal to its enemies by conducting surgical and air strikes. This tells us that India is changing and can take the most difficult decisions and isn’t reluctant to implement them,” he said.While the 2016 strikes against terror pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir were India’s first direct military response to the suicide attack on an army camp in Uri, the air strikes against a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror facility in Pakistan’s Balakot followed the Pulwama attack.The comments came a day after the government announced the country’s highest and second-highest peacetime gallantry awards — the Ashok Chakra and Kirti Chakra — for two Jammu and Kashmir personnel killed in encounters with terrorists.The reference to the fight against expansionism assumes significance in the backdrop of the border row with China in eastern Ladakh where the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army are in talks to disengage their front-line troops from flashpoints on the contested Line of Actual Control.The Army announced on August 6 that the two armies had pulled back their forward deployed troops from Gogra or Patrol Point-17A, which was one of the friction points on LAC, with the breakthrough coming after the 12th round of military talks held on July 31. Problems at Hot Springs and Depsang are yet to be resolved. India and China are locked in a border row for more than 15 months, a phase that witnessed a deadly skirmish in the Galwan Valley last year.The PM made a mention of aircraft carrier Vikrant, locally made light combat aircraft and submarines, underlining that the projects highlighted India’s indigenous manufacturing capability. India’s first indigenous aircraft carrier (IAC) Vikrant, the largest warship to be built in the country, kicked off critical sea trials on August 3 ahead of its planned induction into the Navy in less than a year.The PM also underlined India’s growing prowess in defence manufacturing and the government’s full commitment to boost Atmanirbharta (self-reliance) in the defence sector.He also said Sainik Schools across the country would open their doors to girl students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-fighting-terror-expansionism-101629061069879.html
16-08-2021||India||Three research scholars discover new plant species in Western Ghats||Three research scholars, one from the United States among them, have discovered a new plant in Ponmudi hills in Kerala which is part of the Western Ghats, one of the eight hotspots of biological diversity in the world. They named the plant after Dr N Mohanan (Symplocos Mohananii), former principal scientist and now scientific adviser of M S Swaminathan Research Foundation in Wayanad, north Kerala. They said the tree was named after the scientist for his outstanding contribution spanning 37 years in the field of taxonomy (classification of plants) and conservation of biodiversity. He discovered more than 33 new species from the Western Ghats and also six species were re-discovered many years later (some of them were written off as extinct). Three researchers-- Stephan J, Akhil R, both from the Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden and Research institute (JNTBGRI) in Palode (Thiruvananthapuram) and Peter W Fritsch (curator and scientist) from the Botanical Research Institute of Texas, USA formed part of the team. They have been doing research on ‘Symplocos Mohananii’ for more than four years. “The tree is very endemic in nature and we could spot only five of them during our research. Though it looks like other plants of the genus Symplocos, critical analysis of micro and macro characters of it later revealed the Symplocos Mohananii is a different species,” said one of the scholars R Akhil. The plant was spotted from a hill which was about 3000 feet above sea level and they spent days together in forests, said Fritsch. He said the plant carries white coloured flowers and they could not record opening of flowers so far. White- coloured flowers usually open at night. “Plants of this family are commonly known as sweet leaf plants locally and the bark of a few species were used to treat skin diseases by tribals and also for dye-making. ‘Symplocos Mohananii has also got some medicinal properties but detailed study is needed,” said another team member J Stephen. Since the number of plant is limited they said their next task is to find a large collection in deep forests. Rich in endemic flora and fauna, the Western Ghats, stretching from Gujarat to Kerala, also a UNESCO heritage site which plays an important role in climatic condition of the country, still remains a mystery for scientists. They periodically discover new plants, frogs, reptiles and other species there. Following grave concerns over the depletion of its green cover due to human interference, the Union government had set up an expert panel under eminent ecologist Madhav Gadgil. In 2011 he had submitted his report. When all six states (Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu) coming under the shadow of the Ghats opposed the Gadgil Panel recommendations, a working group was constituted under Dr Kasturirangan, former ISRO chief. A watered down version was done, it was also opposed. Now both expert reports are gathering dust in government cupboards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-research-scholars-discover-new-plant-species-in-western-ghats-101629059661807.html

In an apparent bid to come closer to the masses, the CPI(M) central committee, which virtually met recently, decided to celebrate the 75th Independence Day by hoisting the national flag at its state and district offices across India. During Independence, the undivided Communist Party of India (CPI) raised the slogan, ‘Yeh azaadi jhoota hai” (This is false independence). The CPI(M) was formed in 1964 after a split in the CPI. The national flag was never raised at CPI(M) offices in any state although some of the frontal organisations of the party observed the custom like most of the other partners of the Left Front. “The central committee decided that the party will observe the 75th anniversary highlighting the role of the Communists in the freedom struggle, the Communist party’s contributions to building modern India and consolidating the ‘Idea of India’…,” the central committee said in a statement on August 9. It, however, did not mention the decision to raise the national flag. Octogenarian Biman Bose, a member of the central committee and chairman of the Bengal Left Front on Sunday raised the flag on the roof of the state party office at Alimuddin Street in central Kolkata. “We decided to celebrate because this is the 75th anniversary of Independence,” said Bose without getting into the old controversy. The national flag was also raised at A K Gopalan Bhawan, the CPI(M) headquarters in Delhi, and party offices across the nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpim-hoists-indian-flag-for-first-time-in-57-years-101629054501453.html

Total hospitalisation of those who are with moderate or severe infections stands more or less stabilized at 28,290. Among total hospitalization daily admission is between 10 and 15 per cent. Recovery is also steady and so many hospitals are not flooded, health ministry records show. Meanwhile the state administered around 5 lakh vaccines for the second consecutive day. So far it administered 2,39,22, 416 doses-- out of this 1,72,66,344 are first dose and 66,56,082 second doses (till Saturday). The state has launched a campaign on Saturday to cover all above 60 years with at least one doze of the vaccine. According to the last sero survey at least 45 per cent of the population is not exposed to antibodies and susceptible to infection. Union Health Minister M Mandaviya will visit Kerala on Monday to review the situation. Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan said the state’s high caseload is a serious concern for the Union government. “The state is paying the price for ignoring repeated warnings of the Union government. We have been insisting on institutional quarantine from the beginning itself. But the government opted for home quarantine but records show it flopped,” said the minister. Kerala is reporting more than 60 per cent of the daily cases of the country for almost a month. The central team which visited the eight worst-affected districts in the first week of August also flagged the state’s over lax home quarantine system. It found serious flaws in protocols in home isolation. In districts like Malappuram and Kozhikode, the size of the family is big and those infected easily pass the virus to other members. Home isolation calls for strict procedure like the infected person should have a separate washroom and nobody should be allowed to enter the quarantined room, but the team found that these measures were not followed. This led to increased transmission within homes and formation of small clusters. Fearing another spike the government has tightened restrictions during the ongoing Onam festivities-- mass gatherings, public meetings, community feasts and other functions have been banned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-logs-another-surge-with-18-582-new-covid-19-cases-tpr-crosses-15-101629053541373.html
16-08-2021||India||New plant species discovered in Western Ghats||Three research scholars, one from the United States, have discovered a new plant in Kerala’s Ponmudi hills which is part of the Western Ghats, one of the eight hot spots of biological diversity in the world. They named the plant ‘Symplocos Mohananii’ after Dr N Mohanan, former principal scientist and now scientific adviser of MS Swaminathan Research Foundation in Wayanad, north Kerala. The scholars said the tree was named after the scientist for his outstanding contribution spanning 37 years in the field of taxonomy (classification of plants) and conservation of biodiversity. Mohanan discovered more than 33 new species from the Western Ghats. Stephan J, Akhil R, both from the Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden and Research institute (JNTBGRI) in Palode (Thiruvananthapuram), and Peter W Fritsch, curator and scientist from the Botanical Research Institute of Texas, US, have been doing research on ‘Symplocos Mohananii’ for more than four years. “The tree is very endemic in nature and we could spot only five of them during our research. Though it looks like other plants of the genus Symplocos, a critical analysis of micro and macro characters of it later revealed that the Symplocos Mohananii is a different species,” said R Akhil. Fritsch said the plant was spotted from a hill which was about 3,000 feet above sea level. “The plant carries white flowers but we could not record opening of the flowers so far. The white flowers usually open in night.” J Stephen said, “Plants of this family are commonly known as sweet leaf plants locally and the bark of a few species were used to treat skin diseases by tribals and also for dye-making. Symplocos Mohananii has also got some medicinal properties, but a detailed study is needed.” Since the number of plants is limited, they said their next task is to find its large collection in deep forests. The researchers revealed their discovery last week, but the research, they said, was published in New Zealand-based Phytotoxa International magazine in March. Rich in endemic flora and fauna, the Unesco heritage site Western Ghats stretching from Gujarat to Kerala, which plays an important role in climatic condition of the country, still remains a mystery for scientists. They periodically discover new plants, frogs, reptiles and other species. Following concerns over the depletion of the Ghats’ green cover due to human interference, the union government had set up an experts’ panel under eminent ecologist Madhav Gadgil. In 2011 he had submitted his report. When all six states (Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu) coming under the shadow of the Ghats opposed the Gadgil panel recommendations, a working group was constituted under Dr Kasturirangan, former ISRO chief. The group submitted a watered-down report, but it was also opposed. Now both the expert reports are gathering dust.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-plant-species-discovered-in-western-ghats-101629053181215.html

The government had earlier scrapped three global tenders for the ambitious project.Hyderabad-based engineering firm Medha, which in February secured the contract to supply the electrical systems for the 44 trains, has now been told to advance its production plan so that at least two prototypes can be rolled out by next March following all trials.The indigenous semi-high speed train set, also known as Train 18, is being given a boost with the Railways gearing to roll out at least 10 of them, linking around 40 cities by August 2022, according to officials aware of the development.The maiden run of a Vande Bharat train was flagged off by Modi on the New Delhi-Varanasi route on February 15, 2019. The second such train service between New Delhi and Shri Mata Vaishnodevi Katra was flagged off by Union home minister Amit Shah on October 3 in the same year.Besides this, the Prime Minister also talked about boosting rail connectivity in the northeast region, saying it is significant for the entire country. “Today, we are in the process of writing a new history as far as connectivity to the northeast is concerned. This connectivity is both between hearts and infrastructure. Very soon the job of connecting the capital cities of the northeastern states by rail will be completed,” Modi said.As of today, except Sikkim, all northeastern states are connected to the rail network. The capital cities of Assam, Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh are already connected, while the work to link the capital cities of Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Meghalaya is underway.Referring to the regional connectivity scheme in the aviation sector, Modi said it is unprecedented the way UDAN scheme was connecting far-flung areas of the country and the speed at which new airports are being built.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/75-new-vande-bharat-trains-to-connect-all-parts-of-india-pm-101629051980658.html
16-08-2021||India||Parliament session over: After break, fuel prices may begin rising once again||State-run fuel retailers have kept automobile fuel rates frozen for almost a month in a departure from the policy of aligning petrol and diesel rates daily by tactically using minor gains of falling international oil prices to offset the need for raising pump rates, three people aware of the development said.The strategy was to stop the surging streak of fuel prices to avoid the attention of the Opposition when Parliament was in session, a government official and two company executives said, asking not to be named. As the session is now over, the oil marketing companies may gradually resume the policy of daily price revision, they added.The monsoon session of Parliament started on July 19 and ended two days ahead of schedule on August 11. The companies, however, stopped the daily aligning of pump prices of petrol and diesel days ahead of the session. First, the retail price of diesel was frozen on July 15 at ₹89.87 per litre in Delhi and petrol followed suit after two days, at ₹101.84 a litre.Meanwhile, international oil prices saw wide fluctuations in the last one month. Benchmark Brent crude, which was at $73.47 per barrel on July 15, first fell to $68.62 on July 19 only to jump by over 10.8% at $76.05 on July 29. Oil prices slumped again in the international market and Brent fell to $69.04 a barrel, a drop of over 9.2% from July 29. It, however, bounced back to above $70 mark last week and closed the last trading session on Friday at $70.59 a barrel with a fall of about 1%.Despite international oil prices being highly volatile in the last one month, state-run retailers neither cut nor raised pump rates of petrol and diesel in the country, even as the government reiterated that they follow the daily pricing policy.In a written reply to the Rajya Sabha on August 4, minister of state for petroleum Rameswar Teli said: “Effective June 16, 2017, daily pricing of petrol and diesel has been implemented in the entire country... to bring more transparency and efficiency in pricing to benefit consumers.”Email queries on this matter sent to the three state-run retailers – Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) – and the petroleum ministry did not elicit any response. The three companies enjoy a monopoly in the domestic fuel retail market with about 90% combined market share.Domestic petrol and diesel rates had been moving up since May 4, a day after the results of five assembly polls were declared. The price rally saw petrol becoming costlier by ₹11.44 a litre and diesel by ₹9.14 since May 4. Fuel rates jumped to a historic high and petrol crossed the ₹100 per litre mark in several places for the first time. While Indian Oil rates in Delhi are the benchmark for the entire country, retail prices of the two fuels differ from place to place because of variations in state taxes and local levies.While international oil prices impact pump rates of automobile fuels because India imports more than 80% of the crude oil it processes, steep taxes are the other reason for high rates of petrol and diesel.In Delhi, central levies account for 32.3% of petrol’s price and state taxes 23.07%, according to official data of August 1. On diesel, central taxes are over 35.38% while state taxes are about 14.62%. Through 2020, as global crude prices fell, the central government raised excise duty on fuel to shore up its finances. States, too, followed suit as revenues were hit on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. According to official data, the petroleum sector contributed ₹3,71,726 crore central excise revenue in 2020-21, and ₹2,02,937 crore state levies or value-added tax or VAT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-session-over-after-break-fuel-prices-may-begin-rising-once-again-101629051801245.html
16-08-2021||India||Can’t wait for years to take action: COP 26 president Alok Sharma on climate crisis||The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) last week warned in a key report that the planet has only a small window left to prevent worsening effects of the climate crisis.United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) president Alok Sharma, who will chair the crucial meeting in Glasgow later this year, spoke to HT’s Jayashree Nandi about the IPCC report, net-zero emission targets, and the possibility of still limiting global warming. Sharma, who is set to visit India this week, also said he expects world leaders to finalise a delivery plan for the $100 billion/year pledge for developing countries before the COP26 meeting. Excerpts:The IPCC report has indicated that it is possibly now inevitable that we will breach the 1.5 degrees C goal. Do you think the global community has done so little and so late that we have now reached a point of no return?The IPCC report is a real wake-up call for the whole world and what it does say, of course, is that the door is still ajar, if I can put it like that, but it is likely to close very fast unless we collectively take more ambitious action on cutting emissions. The next decade is going to be absolutely decisive in terms of taking action, so what we cannot do is to wait two years, five years, 10 years before every country comes forward and sets out ambitious plans and actions to deliver them. We need to take action right now.The IPCC report has spelled out that it is critical that parties move to net zero emissions by 2050 to even attempt keeping global warming under 1.5°C or 2°C. Are you expecting developing countries like India to also commit to the target?I was in India some months ago and I am coming again (this week). The message that I delivered to ministers in Delhi is entirely consistent with the message I deliver to every government — that we must do everything we can to keep (warming under) 1.5°C within reach. Part of that is to come up with ambitious commitments to cut emissions by 2030, (then) there are 2030 NDCs (nationally determined contributions), but also countries have to commit to net zero by the middle of the century. Now when we (UK) took on the COP 26 presidency, less than 30% of the global economy was covered by net-zero target, we are now at 70%. You have seen China set out its plan for net-zero by 2060; Brazil has come forward with 2050, so you are seeing countries moving forward. But we want every country to set out plans to go to net-zero by the middle of the century.India and other developing countries believe that the Paris agreement principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities are undermined because the promised finance of $100 billion per year hasn’t come through. How will you gain their trust now?I have been very clear since I took on the role of president for COP 26 that delivering the $100 billion a year from 2020 to 2025 is a matter of trust for developing countries and for me, this is a totemic figure... Now, the good news is that we saw new money coming forward from Germany, from Japan and from Canada at the end of the G7 leaders’ summit (in June) and also the UK... I also held a ministerial meeting where we had around 50 ministers coming together on July 25 and 26 in London and one of the issues that is being taken forward is a clear delivery plan on the $100 billion funding. I am working on that with ministerial colleagues from the German government and the Canadian government, and I hope that we can set out a delivery plan before COP 26, so it will inject confidence into the developing countries.In comparison to top emitters, India’s per capita emissions are far lower than that of the US, China and the EU. Do you think it’s fair to ask countries with extremely low per-capita emissions to switch to net zero?I think the key issue here is about clean growth. I have always been very clear that we cannot ask any developing country, which is growing its economy rapidly, to not grow. What I think we can do is to support a country to leapfrog the dirty power (fossil fuels) and move towards the clean energy revolution. I am incredibly impressed... from all the conversations I had with friends and ministers in India, there is this real desireto push forward on renewables and I think that is what we need to see across all countries.COP26 is a make-or-break conference. Do you have any worries that some countries may block progress?We have been working as a team. I have been very pleased with the overall feedback that I get from governments... that they want to see COP 26 be successful. But at the end of the day, this is going to require compromise on some of the outstanding matters that have to be resolved. I think there is still a lot of hard work to do between now and COP26. I believe this is our last best hope of ensuring that we keep the 1.5°C (target) within reach. The decisions that this set of leaders take will impact younger generations and future generations... This is about the future of humanity and we need to do everything we can to avoid the catastrophe that would otherwise engulf all of us if we don’t make progress at Glasgow.The Bloomberg NEF fact sheet released last month said some G20 countries provided $3.3 trillion support for coal, oil, gas and fossil-fuel power between 2015 and 2019. Eight countries -- Australia, Canada, the US, Brazil, France, Indonesia, Mexico and China -- increased their support to the fossil fuel industry. How will this be addressed when you are expecting developing countries to cut coal?I want COP26 to be the COP that consigns coal power to history and if you look at what the G7 countries have done... and one of the commitments made there was that G7 nations would from this year end the financing of international coal projects overseas. We have the same commitment from South Korea, which is very welcome, and I think more broadly... the private sector investors are increasingly reluctant to invest in coal because from their perspective they can see that in the next few years they may end up with stranded assets. If you look at the market itself, it is moving in the direction of renewables. For example, India has got a real ambitious plan to go to 450GW of renewables and I think you are seeing that across the world as well. The market is moving against coal and there is a desire among countries to move forward with renewables — one of the key issues in terms of financing is how do we will help and support the developing countries access to private finance when it comes to money coming into renewables and that is part of the work we are doing.Several countries, including the UK, have announced net-zero targets. But, when you look at data from Climate Action Tracker, several countries such as Russia, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Brazil, Canada, Australia and even UK are not 2 degree C compliant. This is mainly because the pathways to achieve their climate targets are not clear. How will you ensure countries achieve what they promise?For the UK, we now have an NDC which has reduction of emissions of at least 68% by 2030 on a 1990 base year and we have an independent committee on climate change, which says this is compatible with net-zero by 2050. At the G20, a climate and energy ministers’ meeting in Naples in July, there was commitment from all G20 states to submit ambitious NDCs before COP 26. And they will submit commitments on long-term strategies as well. What we want to see is that every country comes up with its long-term strategy and sets out a clear plan. The UK will be setting out its net-zero strategy before COP26 and then we need to see all countries follow through on actions. One of the areas that we want to try and resolve from the Paris Agreement rule book is transparency, and if we are able to do that, I hope that will also allow people to track what each of us as individual countries are doing to cut emissions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cant-wait-for-years-to-take-action-cop-26-president-alok-sharma-on-climate-crisis-101629051560600.html
16-08-2021||India||PM spells out vision for Independent India@100||In a speech that began with an acknowledgment of the contribution of India’s freedom fighters including Jawaharlal Nehru, outlined recent steps India had taken to ensure the “ease of living” and “ease of doing business”, highlighted current governance challenges including the pandemic and the climate crisis, and laid out a future vision for India at 100 in 2047, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that no obstacle could stop the country from achieving its dreams in the 21st century and declared that India now has the political will to undertake major reforms. Importantly, he said everyone has to do their bit to achieve all this, adding “sabka prayas” (everyone’s effort) to his government’s slogan.Addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on India’s 75th Independence Day, PM Modi unveiled a national blueprint with limited State interference in the everyday life of citizens; a focus on small farmers and rural economy; energy independence with the announcement of a National Hydrogen Mission; a boost to manufacturing, technology, infrastructure and start-ups; employment generation for the young with a ₹100 lakh crore PM Gati Shakti master plan; equity for women and vulnerable sections of society; and balanced regional development with a focus on Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh and the Northeast.In a reference to national security challenges from Pakistan and China, without naming the two countries, the PM underlined India’s battle against “terrorism” and “expansionism” and said the country would do all it needed to strengthen the armed forces. He did not, however, mention the evolving situation in Afghanistan, where the Taliban reached the gates of Kabul on Sunday, after a successful military offensive across the country.India’s Olympic contingent was present at the Red Fort, with PM Modi hailing the success of Indian athletes — with seven medals across six sports, India had its most successful run in Tokyo this year.The Opposition has criticised the speech, with the Congress accusing him of only making announcements about schemes in his Independence Day speeches and not implementing them. “He announces new schemes but these are never implemented or seen on the ground. He says a lot of things but never adheres to them,” senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters.The Congress also took a swipe at the PM for his announcement of ₹100 lakh crore for the infrastructure sector, saying he has been talking of it since 2019. “It has been two years since August 15, 2019. At least, the 100 lakh crore figure could have been changed,” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said in a tweet.In his speech, the PM focused on the past, present and the future.Looking back, he hailed the contribution of a range of freedom fighters from across different strands (both non-violent and revolutionary) of the national movement, spoke of India’s struggle for the “motherland, culture and freedom”, and reiterated that August 14 would be henceforth marked as the Partition Horrors Remembrance Day. “It was one of the biggest tragedies of the last century and the memories of the pain persist… people went through inhuman times... and many didn’t even get a proper farewell. It is important for them to be alive in our memories.” The government’s announcement to this effect on Saturday triggered a mixed response, with many hailing it as a much-needed effort at acknowledging the past while others criticising it for reopening old wounds which may aggravate the politics of division.Turning to the present, the PM spoke of the Covid-19 pandemic as a huge challenge, hailed Corona warriors for their contribution, and highlighted India’s vaccination programme, the world’s largest such exercise. “India doesn’t need to be dependent on others for vaccines. Imagine what would have happened if India didn’t have its own vaccine? Where would we have got it?” While both Covishield and Covaxin are manufactured in India (the latter has also been developed in India), the government has come under criticism for not ensuring timely clearance to foreign-made vaccines which would have helped meet the supply deficit.But the PM also acknowledged the scale of the devastation without directly referring to the second wave this summer, which saw daily cases climb up to over 400,000 and deaths cross 4,000 — widely seen by experts as a conservative estimate. “It is true that fewer people in India have got infected, that we have succeeded in saving more people in terms of population ratio compared to other countries. But to say that we didn’t face challenges would be to close doors for development in the future. We have fewer resources, our population is higher, our lifestyle is different. Despite all our efforts, we couldn’t save many people and this intolerable pain will stay with us.”A large part of the PM’s speech was focused on welfare delivery, justice for vulnerable segments and steps undertaken for rural economy and farmers.While outlining the various welfare measures in the past seven years — for instance, provision of gas cylinders through the Ujjwala scheme, rural roads and housing, toilets, electrification, health insurance through Ayushman Bharat, and financial inclusion — the PM said it was now time to move towards saturation coverage. “The pace of government schemes has increased, they are meeting their targets, the poor are benefiting directly now. But we now need to move towards 100% coverage.”The PM made it clear — at a time when the debate on reservations, caste census, and categorisation of Other Backward Classes (OBCs) has made its way back in political discourse — that there had to be “handholding” of the marginalised. Beyond facilities, this meant continued reservations for Dalits, tribals, OBCs and poor of general categories.He also spoke of the need for development to be all-inclusive and all-encompassing, touching all regions. “India’s east, Northeast, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Himalayan region states, coastal areas, the tribal belt will become the basis of India’s development in the future.” The PM said there has been balanced regional development in both Jammu and Kashmir after the effective abrogation of Article 370 and referred to the establishment of the delimitation commission and plans to hold assembly elections; spoke of Ladakh’s development potential; highlighted the enhanced connectivity in the Northeast and between the Northeast and India’s neighbours to the east; and focused on improved development indicators in 110 aspirational districts.In terms of the rural economy, the PM spoke of enhanced facilities and connectivity in villages giving rise to digital entrepreneurs, the value of cooperatives in the backdrop of the formation of a separate ministry of cooperation at the Centre (led by Amit Shah), and the role of self-help groups, announcing a new e-commerce platform to enable such groups to market and sell their products elsewhere.But the PM’s focus was on agriculture — in the context of prolonged opposition to the new farm laws pushed by the Centre last year. The PM spoke of the need to incorporate scientific feedback to enhance production, and why India must frame policies keeping in view the interests of small farmers, even coining a new slogan of how small farmers are the “pride of India”. “80% of India’s farmers own less than 2 hectares of land each; there is increased fragmentation of land. Past policies did not prioritise these farmers. Agricultural reforms are meant to benefit these farmers”. The PM highlighted the government’s insurance scheme, Kisan credit card, farmers producers organisation, construction of warehouses at the block level, the PM-Kisan scheme under which farmers get an income assistance of ₹6000 each annually, Kisan rail links, and steps to boost export potential of agriculture as evidence of a shift in policy.But along with this, with an eye on the future, the PM also flagged the role of sectors which are essential for India’s future development trajectory — “next generation infrastructure... world class manufacturing... cutting edge technology... new age technology”.In this context, he referred to Make in India (singling out electronics manufacturing and indigenous defence production as successes), the role of infrastructure (with a focus on the ₹100 lakh crore national infrastructure pipeline), the success of startups (with a reference to how they are the new “wealth creators”, with many have turned into unicorns of a valuation in excess of $1 billion), and exports (with an appeal to Indian exporters to focus on quality with an eye on global markets). “Major reforms and decisions need political will. And in India, there is no shortage of political will. The world knows we are writing a new chapter of governance”.Redefining the idea of next generation reforms, the PM focused on the need to make service delivery more accessible for citizens till the last mile. “Earlier, the government was in the driving seat. Now, times have changed. We must end the unnecessary interference of the government and government processes in the lives of citizens. We have liberated people from unnecessary laws... 15,000 compliance requirements were ended... Liberation from laws is good for both ease of living and ease of doing businesses.”The PM also spoke of the role of education, in light of the New Education Policy, with a focus on how education in one’s mother tongue is a weapon in the fight against poverty and need not be an obstacle. Taking off from the success of women athletes in the Tokyo Olympics, the PM highlighted how women were excelling in each field and ready to take their space and it was the duty of citizens, police, the criminal justice system and all stakeholders to ensure women were secure and had respect. He also announced that Sainik schools will now be open for girls too.With climate emerging as a key governance challenge — with new warnings about how the climate crisis is already straining environment and will have huge implications for India’s political economy and livelihoods — the PM said environmental security was now a part of national security.He said that India was an energy dependent nation, spending ₹12 lakh crore for its energy needs every year — and declared a goal of making India energy independent by the 100th year of Indian independence. The PM also announced the launch of a National Hydrogen Mission, a mission circular economy, and highlighted attempts in areas of recycling, organic farming, energy conservation, protection of wildlife and increase of forest cover, renewables.“India is changing... it can take difficult decisions and doesn’t hesitate,” said PM Modi, referring to the decisions on Article 370, the rollout of the Goods and Services Tax, implementation of one-rank-one-pension, peaceful resolution of the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute, constitutional status to the backwards commission, district elections in Kashmir, record foreign direct investment , and surgical and air strikes across the border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-spells-out-vision-forindependent-india100-101629051500646.html

The ministry said the question was sensitive in nature.“The Rajya Sabha Secretariat is requested to refer to the Provisionally Admitted Question... raised by Smt. Shanta Chhetri, M.P., due for answer on 22 Jul, 2021 on “Indian Position in Democracy Index... In this regard, it is to state that question raised by the Hon’ble Member is very sensitive in nature. As per the report of the Economic Intelligence Unit, United Kingdom (the publishing agency), the primary cause of the democratic regression, inter alia, was an erosion of civil liberties and the authorities handling the coronavirus pandemic in the country,” the letter said.

The delegation, consisting of Union ministers Piyush Goyal, Pralhad Joshi, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Dharmendra Pradhan, Bhupender Yadav, Arjun Ram Meghwal and V Muraleedharan, alleged that the marshals in the House were prevented from discharging their duties after furious Opposition leaders stormed the Well and protested against the passage of the general insurance bill.The memorandum was handed over to Naidu in the presence of Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh. According to an official familiar with the matter, Naidu told the delegation that he will examine the matter for deciding on the appropriate course of action.As per a report by the Rajya Sabha secretariat on the pandemonium, opposition MPs tore papers, obstructed ministers from taking their seats, choked and suffocated one marshal, dragged and pushed another, took videos and even climbed on a LED TV stand during the session on August 11. The Opposition denied these contentions, and blamed the government for the unruly scenes in the House, which, they said, were sparked by “outsiders” acting as marshals. Fourteen Opposition leaders had also met Naidu on Thursday to condemn the government’s actions in the recently concluded monsoon session.Meanwhile, Naidu also held a meeting with panel vice chairman Sasmit Patra, who was in the Chair when the above incidents took place in the Upper House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-ministers-meet-naidu-seek-action-against-oppn-mps-over-house-ruckus-101629049461242.html
16-08-2021||India||India rushes to secure citizens in Afghanistan||As Taliban fighters began entering Kabul on Sunday following the collapse of President Ashraf Ghani’s government, Indian authorities scrambled to pull out hundreds of diplomats and citizens still in Afghanistan.The speed of the Taliban’s advance into the capital again took most countries by surprise, though people familiar with developments said the Indian side was well prepared for all contingencies. The Indian Air Force’s heavy lift aircraft, especially the C-17 Globemasters, have been on round-the-clock standby for several days and could be pressed into service at short notice for an evacuation.The Indian side had been anticipating the Taliban advance into Kabul would take a few more days, and reports about the entry of fighters into the city on Sunday as Ghani and his close aides reportedly fled to Tajikistan triggered hectic consultations, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.The government is closely monitoring the rapidly evolving situation in Afghanistan to decide on the evacuation of diplomatic personnel from Kabul, the people said.Specific plans for all contingencies are already in place and all steps will be taken to ensure that the staff of the Indian embassy in Kabul and Indian nationals are not at any risk, the people added.Plans are also in place for the destruction and retrieval of documents and computers at the Indian embassy, which is the only functional mission in Afghanistan following the withdrawal of staff from the consulates in Herat, Jalalabad, Mazar-e-Sharif and Kandahar over the past year. There was no official word from the external affairs ministry to the latest developments in Afghanistan. New Delhi has consistently said it is opposed to any attempt to forcibly capture power in Kabul.Taliban fighters began entering Kabul from all sides without facing any resistance by late on Sunday afternoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rushes-to-secure-citizens-in-afghanistan-101629049222011.html
16-08-2021||India||In a first since 1979, Assam celebrates I-day sans bandh call: CM Sarma jubilant||Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma expressed his gratitude on Sunday as Independence Day was celebrated in the state for the first time in decades without any rebel outfit calling for a shutdown of the day. He said it was significant and historic as it had happened for the first time since 1979. The chief minister also appealed to Paresh Barua, the chief of rebel outfit United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I), to come to the negotiating table. He had made a similar appeal after assuming power in May this year.Taking to Twitter, Sarma said the major milestone was a reflection of the “Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas” campaign of the Union government and relentless efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bring peace and stability in the northeast. He further said the development marked a fitting tribute to the Centre’s government-led Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav celebrations that kicked off to commemorate 75 years of the country’s independence.This major milestone is a reflection of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas through #SabkaPrayas and relentless efforts of Adarniya PM Shri @narendramodi ji to bring peace and stability in entire NE. 3/3“I salute the people of Assam for commemorating our 75th year of Independence truly on the principles of Jan Bhagidari. It is significant & historic that there was no bandh call by any organisation this Independence Day,” he wrote.The ULFA (I), which had been calling for Assam Bandh on Independence Day and Republic Day for several decades, refrained from the practice for the first time for Independence Day this year. The outfit had declared a unilateral ceasefire in May this year in view of the pandemic situation.Around the same time when Sarma took charge as CM, he had urged Barua to come for peace talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-since-1979-assam-celebrates-i-day-sans-bandh-call-cm-sarma-jubilant-101629041852209.html
16-08-2021||Today's||30 years ago, the world discovered the web. And life changed||In March 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, a young software engineer working in the European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN submitted a proposal titled Information Management to his superiors, meant for scientists to document and share their work through a network.The initial proposal received a lukewarm response with his boss Mike Sendall noting on its cover – vague but exciting. Though not accepted as an official CERN project, Tim Berners-Lee did get some time allotted later next year to work on his idea which was refined and renamed as the WorldWideWeb project. Within a few months, the language, protocol, and rules for data transfer in the network including HTTP and HTML that are still the foundations of the web were developed. Soon afterwards, the web server and a browser were devised. On August 6, 1991, the world’s first website was launched. It was dedicated to information on the WorldWideWeb project. Berners-Lee did not patent his invention. Instead, he offered it as royalty-free software, and invited those outside the CERN community to join and collaborate on the web community.Also Read | IT Rules: Bombay HC stays 2 clauses, says people would be starved of liberty of thoughtThe internet, which had started as a United States defence project in the 1960s, had already connected millions of computers by then through which files and even the first forms of e-mails were exchanged. However, the web resulted in an explosion of the digital space.The years from 1989 to 1991 had a fair share of momentous events including the fall of the Berlin wall that resulted in the unification of Germany, the dissolution of the Soviet Union that restructured the world order with the United States as the lone superpower, and economic reforms in India which have unshackled our potential towards becoming an economic powerhouse. The events that led to the development of the web, received little fanfare then, but would increasingly be mentioned with these epochal events in the digital age.Currently, there are over 1.8 billion web pages, and 4.8 billion internet users. The initial web pages were just pinboards of information. Various services were integrated with time. The advent of smartphones and higher-speed internet accelerated digital transformation. Social media platforms and aggregators exponentially increased the capacity to form digital communities and markets. The world’s largest financial, health and education service providers, shopping spaces, publishers are all now from the digital realm. Indeed, five of the six largest corporations in the world are from the tech sector. They derive the bulk of their value from the internet. Their cumulative market cap is over $8 trillion which would make them the third-largest economy in the world by themselves. None of this would have been possible without an altruistic web founder’s decision 30 years ago to gift the world its open-source code that enabled anyone with a computer and an internet connection to create a browser or webpage on their own. Led by technologies including 5G and quantum computing, we are on the cusp of a new tech wave. Data has already become the engine that drives the digital economy. Big tech firms and the State are harvesting terabytes of data and are locked in power struggles across the world over rights to be the gatekeepers of the internet and of innovation.Meanwhile, the interests of the people who contribute most of the data have become secondary. There are several ongoing projects across the world attempting to change this. Blockchain technology would enable micropayments to every person who provides value on the internet. This could make the digital economy fairer and more redistributive. Berners-Lee himself is working on an open-source web decentralisation project with MIT, called Solid, that enables individual internet users to control the access of data and content they generate.The success of some of the projects would transform the internet as we know it. It would become participatory and democratic. The balance of power will then, hopefully, shift towards the biggest drivers and value creators in the digital space, the people.

16-08-2021||Today's||From India, a note of concern about South Africa||South Africa rocked by mass violence? Over 300 dead, shops gutted, highways blocked, and trucks set ablaze? Hard to believe, even harder to accept.That Nelson Mandela’s rainbow nation should have to experience a dance of death with fire — spewed from petrol bombs — being its chosen weapon, is not something that the world expected. In July, the country was gripped by violence and rioting, with the armed forces being deployed in several regions to quell protests and bring back a sense of calm.Analyses of the causes and the nature of the flash are cautious and tentative, for observers are not quite sure yet if President Cyril Ramaphosa will be able to control the situation or not. Crossed fingers do not write easily. And yet, some meaning has to be made out of the situation.Why?Former President Jacob Zuma (79) is central to the “why”. In his rise to the nation’s presidency in the mid-2000s, KwaZulu Natal saw itself at the pinnacle of power in the new South Africa. However, in his recent trial and arrest, that gradient was seen and portrayed by his supporters as having tilted down. This is where the “why” becomes crucial.Not everyone in KwaZulu Natal has been enraged by the turn in the former president’s fate. With details of accusations of corruption piling up, South Africa saw a sign of “no one is so high as to be higher than justice”.Then, why the blood and bedlam?With inequalities reigning and riling the poor, and Covid-19 sharpening the endemicity of misery into an epidemic of hitherto unknown scale, South Africa was already afflicted. But areas with high concentrations of Zuma supporters now had something else that could be added to the crisis — a sense of being wronged. And in this, political players saw an opportunity and used it. As Greg Arde wrote in a South African online newspaper, Daily Maverick, on August 2, “It was as though the unrest became a lightning rod for frustration around many things.”Also Read | Black Sunday in Africa: 51 die in Mali attacks, 12 troops killed in Burkina FasoHow?The violence did not erupt “just like that”, as in some seismic happening. Close observers of the South African scene believe that KwaZulu Natal, where most of the violence for over three days has been located, the areas of Gauteng and Mpumalanga would not have reacted as they have, had it not been for political players, chagrined by Zuma’s fate and liable to lose out by his imminent jailing, orchestrating the unrest — with deadly invisibility. A group, violent in intent and adept in the methods of violence, focused on enriching itself through the capture of State resources and key ministries, and swiftly and skillfully got into the act of planning retaliation to the process of law. The Zondo Commission on State Capture, a public inquiry launched by Zuma, points to this.The whole process starting with roadblocks, the burning of trucks on the highway, the looting of supermarkets and malls, then factories and industry, and later, warehouses and key installations such as oil manufacturing plants was not the work of poor people suddenly angered. Strategists with ground-level operatives, using a group of criminal elements — a familiar pattern in India — planned the havoc with technological prowess and precision, and used the poor to come in and do the actual looting.Affected communities organised themselves into vigilante groups to safeguard their neighbourhoods through street watches and the like, only to be infiltrated by criminal elements who then got the vigilantes to go beyond self-defence and attack people, with some 20 people reportedly killed. Which is when the term “ethnic” was given to the riots. And “racism” was heard.Kwazulu Natal as a whole did not back the violence. The Zulu king and Inkatha veteran Mangosuthu Buthelezi distanced themselves from the grim happenings. It is important to note this.As an uneasy and traumatised calm returns, we ask, “What does the future hold for that great country?” At the time of writing, no one can answer that with confidence.Two serious issues need to be considered. First, the opportunities given by freedom have been used by some in South Africa’s new elite to turn iron handcuffs into gold cufflinks. This is tragic and dangerous.Second, while it would be factually wrong and unjust to dub these tragic events as “ethnic”, who can deny that fault-lines exist in South Africa, as they do in South Asia, and can be deepened, sharpened, and exploited?The poor are invariably co-opted by power-seekers who then glide out of sight. Hope lies in President Ramaphosa restoring order by immobilising the inciters. And there is another great sign of promise. Communities all over are now coming together to work on peace processes without waiting for the government to show the way. The trauma has awakened a spirit among the people to work towards a togetherness that transcends ethnic boundaries.South Africa is meant for healing, not hate. For greatness, not greed.Gopalkrishna Gandhi is a former administrator, diplomat and governor The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/from-india-a-note-of-concern-about-south-africa-101629113365666.html
16-08-2021||Today's||Young Indians distrust China, Pakistan; rate pandemic, economy as big challenges||Foreign policy is considered the domain of the elite, and public opinion on international relations has rarely been documented in India. While there have been efforts to assess public opinion on foreign policy issues, they suffer from limitations due to scope, regularity, consistency, and methodology. There is a dearth of systematic data collection and analysis on how Indians feel about the government’s key foreign policy interventions, India’s relations with other countries, and major global developments.When the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) first conceptualised the foreign policy survey last year, it aimed to build on the existing strand of polling research in India. The idea was to bridge the gap between policymakers and the public. As India frames policies to respond to the geopolitical realities of the 21st century, it must ensure that its policies reflect the will of its citizens. Since around 60% of the population comprises the young, the survey assessed the opinion and perceptions of this demographic.In December 2020, the poll sampled 2,037 Indians aged 18-35 from 14 cities. It was administered in eight regional languages, and in English. The urban youth had a positive assessment of the conduct of the country’s foreign policy, with 72% of respondents rating it as either very good or good. While a majority supported the government policies on China, Pakistan and the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), the policy with the least support was the government’s withdrawal from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).This demographic felt that the biggest foreign policy challenges facing India were the pandemic, terrorism, the border conflict with China, the climate crisis, and border conflict with Pakistan, in that order. The high ranking of the pandemic is a reflection of the current global health crisis. In terms of foreign policy goal setting, strengthening the Indian economy received the highest priority at 89%, perhaps an acknowledgment of how far the pandemic has adversely affected the economy.Also Read | In Afghanistan, the limits of Indian powerThe survey responses on China and Pakistan are illuminating on how young urban Indians view India’s neighbours. The respondents displayed low levels of trust towards Pakistan, with only 10% displaying positive trust ratings. On China, there is a high level of concern regarding its rise as a global power, its growing economic and military superiority, as well as Beijing’s possible interference in India’s neighbourhood. The survey also found that 62% were of the view that India should abandon non-alignment in case of rising US-China tensions.Among major powers, China is the least trusted country (77% expressed distrust), while the United States (US) was the most trusted country (77% expressed trust). Resultantly, the government’s recent ban of Chinese mobile apps received the highest level of endorsement (86%), followed by controlling illegal immigration (74%), the Balakot airstrike (68%) and strengthening Quad (64%).The urban youth displayed a high level of awareness for older multilateral institutions such as the United Nations (UN), and three of every four respondents (74%) felt that India’s quest for a permanent seat at the UN Security Council was a very important goal. Two-thirds of those surveyed said that they had not heard of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), surprising given that NAM is connected to India’s historical approach towards foreign policy.The urban youth are deeply divided over the impact of globalisation on India and its economy, society, and culture, their standard of living, travel to and from other countries, and education opportunities overseas. While the opportunity to study abroad is viewed positively, optimism regarding moving abroad is markedly much lower.This poll has given both predictable and unpredictable results, providing insights into the understanding of Indian youth on critical issues related to India’s foreign policy. This, and future editions of the survey, will help policymakers, academics, researchers —and the public itself — understand and appreciate the importance of democratising foreign policy in India.Harsh V Pant is professor, King’s College London, and director of studies, Observer Research Foundation.

16-08-2021||Today's||In Afghanistan, the limits of Indian power||The suddenness with which the Taliban has seized control of Afghanistan seems to have caught most analysts off-guard. Regrettably, most Indian writings are limited to how India has lost, and how it has allowed Pakistan an easy ride to victory. That all India did in Afghanistan over the last two decades is lost. It is also argued that India should both have publicly called on the United States (US) not to withdraw and simultaneously built a coalition of the willing to frustrate a Taliban victory. Some have even argued that India should have done more militarily to help the Afghan National Army, with suggestions that, even at this stage, India should aim to stop the Taliban from seizing the reins of power.We have let a sense of panic take over the public narrative. National interests are secured over years and decades, but it is never one-way traffic and reverses should be expected. A reality check is the best way to understand what is happening that would allow us to craft the best way forward.One, Afghanistan was never India’s to lose; the losers sadly are the Afghan people. If anything, India’s efforts should be centred on helping them escape the tyranny that is poised to take over their lives. Afghans see India as their friend, and not without reason. India allows them access to education and health facilities, but this is not charity from our side; the Afghans pay for these at commercial rates. India serves as a relevant political and development model, which they prefer to those offered by countries to their East and West.Strategically, good relations with India allow Afghan rulers much greater agency in dealing with Pakistan, on which they are dependent for reasons of geography and social relations. India was on the opposite side of the Mujahideen during the anti-Soviet jihad. However, the Mujahideen were quick to reach out to India once they left Peshawar and reached Kabul. History may not repeat itself in exactly the same way, but it does point to possibilities. But yes, our past efforts have not gone to waste.Second, could India have persuaded the US to stay on? This is extremely unlikely, given Joe Biden’s long-held view that the US had no business doing nation-building or even getting involved in counter-insurgency. He had opposed Barack Obama’s surge and once Osama bin Laden was eliminated, his resolve strengthened. Donald Trump held the same view and not for electoral reasons.The US army’s Afghan deployment has not featured in the top 20 political issues in any survey over the past decade. What is less well known is that since 2016, the US army effectively stopped operating, except to give air support to Afghan forces. Over this period, the US army suffered an average casualty of one per month. Could the US have maintained a low-cost, minimal presence in Afghanistan? Yes perhaps — but could India have told the US to do so? That’s not how diplomacy works.Three, should India not have built a coalition of wary neighbours to stall the Taliban? Unlike the post-1996 period, when the Taliban was opposed by the Northern Alliance, and India could work with Russia and Iran to support this armed group, the circumstances are completely different at present. For geopolitical reasons that have nothing to do with India, these two countries have allied themselves with the Taliban to embarrass the US, and as part of an anti-Islamic State (IS) alliance.Russia did the political heavy-lifting to legitimise the Taliban by organising peace conferences where representatives of the Afghan leaders sat with the Taliban, often with international participation. Representatives of the government could only attend in their private capacities. The Taliban terminology of referring to the government as “Kabul/ puppet regime” was legitimised.Four, should India not have militarily strengthened the Afghan army? This ignores both geostrategy and geography. For much of the war, the US had made it clear that India’s footprint in Afghanistan should be civilian only, so as not to annoy the Pakistani army. Indian support to the Afghan army was limited to training and supply of light weaponry. Later, four helicopters were supplied, but from Ukraine and not from India. The fear that any supply would land up in the hands of the Taliban has been borne out. Media reports suggest that the Taliban have seized control of hundreds of Humvees and heavy weaponry from the government forces, including one helicopter given by India.In terms of the ground situation, it is clear that most Taliban gains have come from local deals and not through fighting. The elected provincial council members and the government machinery handed over cities to the Taliban, with the army melting away without a fight. There is no appetite anywhere for any coalition to stop the Taliban from taking over. The only point of dispute is whether the Taliban would settle to stay in the background and allow a more acceptable administration to nominally take over as an interim measure. Or would they defy their Pakistani army mentors and assert direct control?In these confusing times, it is best to calmly view the situation, show flexibility to adapt to the fast-changing situation and not let panic numb Indian decision-making.Shakti Sinha is honorary director, Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Policy Research and International Studies, MS University, Vadodara.

16-08-2021||Editorials||The fall of Afghanistan||Twenty years after the United States (US) militarily invaded Afghanistan and ousted the Taliban from power, the Taliban is back in Kabul as the US fled in scenes reminiscent of its exit from Vietnam. Notwithstanding the spin from Washington, this is a strategic defeat. The US exit was understandable. But the way it was managed is unpardonable. The US misread the Taliban’s intentions and capabilities, didn’t act against Pakistan enough to deter support for the Taliban, and carried out a farcical peace process where the Taliban walked away with international legitimacy without giving up on its ideological agenda and coercive machinery. Taliban is much stronger than it was in the 1990s, and the US has left democratic Afghans, women, and minorities at peril.This is also Pakistan’s win. Notwithstanding the differences that exist between Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and the Taliban, ISI’s strategy of waiting for the US exit while supporting the Taliban has paid off for now. Pakistan’s aim of securing “strategic depth” is close to being met. Its objective of eroding Indian presence in Afghanistan is in motion. And it will be the centre of a new arrangement where China, Russia, and others will use Islamabad’s good offices to deal with Afghanistan. At some point, Pakistan will have to deal with resurgent Afghan nationalism — but that’s in the future.Also Read | As Nibri crosses 100, reading the economic signalsIndia, like the US, overestimated the power of the Afghan government. It delayed contact with the Taliban till it was too late. There is no Northern Alliance to support, and cobbling together an anti-Taliban coalition will not be free of costs. India’s connectivity projects across the region will be hit. The ability to covertly hurt Pakistan will diminish. And jihadi attention may well shift to Kashmir. An under-appreciated trigger for India’s decision to revoke Kashmir’s constitutional status was the calculation that a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan could lead to a repeat of the early 1990s in the Valley. But whether this move has cemented Indian control in Kashmir or created an even more fertile ground for the resumption of terror is to be seen. Delhi must first evolve a short-term policy to deal with the rescue of Indians still in Afghanistan; refuge to Afghans seeking exile; terms of engagement with the Taliban; and enhanced security threats. It must also have a medium-term policy on whether to lie low and recognise the Taliban regime or invest in weakening the Taliban and instruments that can be used for the purpose. What is certain is that August 15, 2021, will have a profound impact on geopolitics across South, West, and Central Asia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-fall-of-afghanistan-101629112705119.html
16-08-2021||Editorials||As Nibri crosses 100, reading the economic signals||The Nomura India Business Resumption Index (Nibri) has crossed 100 (pre-pandemic base) for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. Nibri, which has emerged as one of the most popular high-frequency indicators of economic activity in the post-pandemic period, is based on Google mobility indices, driving mobility from Apple, power demand, and the labour force participation rate. There are three key takeaways of Nibri crossing 100 in the week of August 15.One, vaccinations are crucial to restore economic activity. The V-shaped recovery in Nibri after the second wave would not have been possible without vaccines. As of August 15, India has given at least one jab to 427 million people out of the estimated 940 million adults. The pace should have been better, but the scale isn’t insignificant. As people get vaccinated, economic activity will resume.Also Read | In Afghanistan, the limits of Indian powerTwo, partial lockdowns are preferable to blanket lockdowns from an economic point of view. The second wave was far more severe than the first. The fact that the Centre did not impose a hard lockdown like the 68-day phase beginning March 25, 2020, ensured that the economy did not suffer like last year. This is an important lesson to remember in case of a third wave. And finally, Nibri crossing 100 should not make us complacent. Nibri is not meant to capture challenges such as weakness of aggregate demand. This newspaper has consistently argued that lack of demand is the binding constraint on the economy regaining its momentum. Fiscal policy must do all it can to address this challenge to prevent any further damage to the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/as-nibri-crosses-100-reading-the-economic-signals-101629112045155.html
