08-08-2021||Mumbai||Chhota Rajan henchman ran extortion racket from jail||An investigation by the anti-extortion cell (AEC) of the Mumbai crime branch has revealed how gangster Chhota Rajan’s former henchman, Yusuf Suleiman Kadri alias Yusuf Bachkana, who has his own gang, was running an extortion racket from Hindalga central jail in Belagavi district of Karnataka, where he is serving a life term.Bachkana, police officers said, ran the racket with the help of two people from Mumbai — 57-year-old Tilak Nagar resident Habiba Khan, a widow of a Rajan gang member, and Prakash Kunchikurve, a sweeper employed with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Born and brought up in Dharavi, Khan was married to Hussain Ahmed Khan alias Hussain Ustara, a smuggler and member of the Dawood Ibrahim gang, who died in 2002 due to cardiac arrest. Rajan used to visit his residence in Tilak Nagar with his other henchman DK Rao.According to joint commissioner of police (crime branch) Milind Bharambe, Dharavi resident Kunchikurve was also on Bachkana’s payroll since long.Both Khan and Kunchikurve were arrested by the AEC after Bachkana was booked in Mumbai on June 8 for threatening a Ghatkopar-based builder, and then arrested and brought to Mumbai on July 22.Their interrogation revealed the modus operandi. Khan used to visit offices and new project sites of builders in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai, pretending to be a prospective flat or shop purchaser and used to collect all information about the builder, the firm, its partners, their old and new projects, and also look into their financial status and political links. She used to pass all the information, including personal contact details to Bachkana, who would then threaten the builder and force him to pay them a ransom.In case of the Ghatkopar builder, Khan had visited the site in May 2021, pretending to be a flat purchaser. As usual, she visited the site alone and took an auto to reach the site. After gathering information about the developer, she contacted Bachkana through WhatsApp. Police officers said she also used other mobile apps to send messages and communicate with Bachkana. The builder started getting calls from May 19. Fed up with the calls, he lodged a police complaint on the basis of which Ghatkopar police registered an FIR on June 8. The case was later transferred to the AEC for further probe.Initial investigation revealed that the threatening calls originated from Hindalga central jail in Belgavi where Bachkana was lodged. The extortionist had called the builder many times and sent his recorded clips and also threatened the builder with dire consequences if he failed to pay him Rs50 lakh.“We then wrote to the jail authorities and the Karnataka government as well and obtained a production warrant for arresting and bringing Bachkana to Mumbai,” said deputy commissioner of police Prakash Jadhav, of the crime branch. “We have also asked the jail authority to investigate as to how Bachkana was allowed to use a mobile phone inside the jail and recover the used phone and send it to the AEC for further probe. But they have not yet recovered the phone,” added the crime branch officer.During interrogation, Bachkana revealed the name of Kunchikurve who used to go to meet him in the court on hearing dates and on his direction, Kunchikurve had procured Khan’s latest mobile number and gave it to him. Bachkana also revealed that he spoke to Khan on the phone from jail. As per his instructions, Khan gathered information of the builder and passed the same on to him. Police officers said Bachkana has confessed that Khan had passed the Ghatkopar builder’s details and contact number to him, said police inspector Yogesh Chavan of the AEC. The AEC then arrested Khan on July 22 from her residence and Kunchikurve was also arrested on July 24. Now both are in police custody till August 6.A crime branch officer said Bachkana had also threatened a Navi Mumbai-based builder for extortion and part of the ransom was collected from the builder.Kunchikurve’s role was to visit the court whenever Bachkana came to court on hearing dates in Mumbai and provide food, clothes as well as information to him and handle his finances. Police sources also said Kunchikurve was allegedly on Bachkana’s payroll and was paid ₹200,00 every month by Bachkana. He was said to be the right-hand man of Bachkana for several years. Police officers said Bachkana had worked as a sharpshooter for the Rajan gang, and it was Rajan’s close aide Ravi Mallesh Bora aka DK Rao who had introduced Habiba Khan to Bachkana. At that time, the Tilak Nagar resident was arrested with Rao for trying to extort from a Badlapur-based builder and Bachkana was arrested for allegedly planning to kill filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt. DK Rao and Bachkana were old friends as both had worked for Rajan. Six months after her arrest, Khan was let out on bail and during court visits for the case, Rao had introduced her to Bachkana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/chhota-rajan-henchman-ran-extortion-racket-from-jail-101628447233184.html
08-08-2021||Lucknow||JP Nadda’s message to Uttar Pradesh BJP: Performance will matter, not profiles||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief JP Nadda laid down the blueprint for the 2022 state assembly elections during his two-day visit to Uttar Pradesh on Saturday and Sunday, making it clear that only performance would matter, and profiles won’t, leaders privy to the development said. Nadda concluded his visit to UP, holding party meetings in Lucknow and Agra, before flying back to Delhi on Sunday evening.While tickets to sitting lawmakers would be decided on the report of the party in-charges of all 403 assembly constituencies and ground level feedback, the BJP leadership has also decided to ensure “collective responsibility” by getting ministers and senior leaders to attend booth-level campaigns and take ownership of associating voters with the party at the booth-level, party leaders said. From Monday, the BJP unit in UP, as well as the government, would set in motion a series of voter-connect initiatives through the meeting of panna pramukh or in-charge of a page in voters list. The experiment of panna pramukhs was tested in Gujarat in 2007.“The booth adhyaksh and panna pramukh (booth president and in-charge of page on voters’ list), our lowest representatives at the grassroots are going to be the key in the party campaign. To ensure that the cadres are galvanised at the local level, even ministers and senior leaders could be made panna pramukh in their regions,” a BJP leader said.“Senior leaders would also visit booth presidents to ensure that the top leadership is connected with the ground level cadres,” party leaders said. To continue the engagement with villages, the BJP is thinking of newer ways to engage with state’s countryside, party leaders said.The party had organised a get-together of all the new district panchayat and kshetra panchayat chairpersons in Lucknow on Saturday and tasked them with specific assignments.On August 23, the party would launch “booth vijay” campaign. To supplement this rural engagement, the Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), would launch a month long “ek gaon, ek tiranga (one village, one tricolour)” campaign from August 15. The UP BJP unit and the Yogi Adityanath government would regularly undertake people-connect campaigns as well as initiatives. The party leadership would also ensure that before his big rallies begin, Prime Minister Narendra Modi would keep connecting virtually with the people of the state on a regular basis, BJP leaders said. While the UP BJP leaders would undertake a campaign to clean memorials and statues of great leaders across the state on Monday, PM Modi would virtually transfer the next installment of PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi to beneficiaries and also interact with some of them from Kasganj.On August 5, the PM had interacted with poorest of the poor beneficiaries of PM-Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PM-GKAY) in Varanasi, Sultanpur, Jhansi, Kushinagar and Saharanpur. On August 10, the PM will launch Ujjwala 2.0 from Mahoba in Bundelkhand. Ujjwala, the free gas connection scheme, was earlier launched from Ballia in UP in 2016.“Modi is the party’s lifeline and so he would continue to interact with UP in some way or the other before his big rallies start happening closer to the elections,” a party leader said. The statue and memorial cleanliness campaigns would conclude on August 15. They would be followed by party meetings in all assembly segments till August 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/jp-nadda-s-message-to-uttar-pradesh-bjp-performance-will-matter-not-profiles-101628446992666.html
08-08-2021||Mumbai||Personal Finance: Common investment mistakes||While investment is necessary, not all people know the right way to do it. The idea behind parking money in various market instruments is to financially secure your future while saving enough for needs like higher education or health or retirement. But the road to successful investment is filled with errors. Here are some common ones: Lack of clarity: Why have you chosen a particular financial instrument over another? Do you have investment goals? How much return would you like to earn after a specific period? Have you divided your financial goals into long-term, mid-term and short-term before deciding on your investments? These four questions about investment decisions are crucial. Past performance: The past may have an impact on your future financial decisions, but it cannot become the sole consideration. People often check past returns to gauge particular stocks or funds, and while assessing the working of a financial instrument helps, any decision regarding its purchase must be rooted in the present context and in its future possibilities. A financial instrument’s returns depend on myriad factors including inflation and current economic conditions. Also, changes in management and business policies could cause the price of a particular stock to increase. Exaggerated expectation: Timely and regular investments can get you handsome returns, but to expect becoming filthy rich within a year amount to extremely high expectation of earnings and profits. While you may be making your investments after considerable planning and research, be ready to face any adverse situation too or realize that not all stocks and investment options may yield you expected returns. Not diversifying: Investment diversification is essential to risk management. Allocating investments in different channels or to different categories helps mitigate the risk associated with investments that may be volatile or subject to extreme market movements, but still are worthy enough to invest in. People refuse to look beyond debt funds and fixed money market instruments to earn fixed returns, and wile While this shields them from possible market losses, it does not give access to good returns needed to beat rising inflation. No period reviews: A common and avoidable mistake that most people make is not reviewing their investment portfolio regularly. While you may have invested in myriad market instruments, your inability to check their performance regularly will keep you bereft of the necessary information needed to make your investment goals and decide the right balance of equity and debt funds in the long run.Personal Finance is a weekly feature that aims to provide our readers pertinent and helpful financial information||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/personal-finance-common-investment-mistakes-101628446991470.html
08-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s Delta Plus cases surge to 45, from 21 in June||Amid the relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions, the number of Delta Plus cases has surged to 45, from 21 in June. The highest number of cases has been recorded in Jalgaon, followed by Ratnagiri and Mumbai, among others. The variant has also been identified among young adults below 18 years. Almost 80% of the samples sent for the sequencing has tested positive for the Delta variant. However, public health officers have observed no significant surge of the variant in these districts.The Delta Plus (AY.1) is a mutation of the highly transmissible Delta variant of Sars-CoV-2 (B.1.617.2) and detected in the state during the second wave. In June, the Union health ministry declared it as the variant of concern.As per the recent data provided by the state health department, Jalgaon has recorded 13 cases, Ratnagiri 11, Mumbai 6, Thane 5, Pune 3 and one each in Palghar, Beed, Aurangabad, Sindhudurg, Nandurbar, Akola and Sangli.In the second wave which started in the middle of February, medical experts observed higher infection rate compared to the first wave. Since then, on a monthly basis, the public health department has been sending samples for genome sequencing. “So far, we have sent more than 8,000 samples for genome sequencing. Although the positivity rate of the Delta Plus variant is below 0.05%, almost 80% of the samples have tested positive for the variant,” said Dr Awate. In the 42-60 age group, 14 patients have been identified. Also, five patients above 60 years of age have contracted the variant.Genome sequencing is an exercise to study the changes in the structure of the virus over time. A combination of changes in the ribonucleic acid of the virus can give birth to a new variant. The samples from the state are sent for genome sequencing to the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB). “We have sent more than 8,000 samples for genome sequencing. Though the positivity rate of the Delta Plus variant is below 1%, almost 80% of the samples have tested positive for the Delta variant,” said Dr Awate.However, there is a silver lining as medical experts haven’t observed any sudden surge in Delta Plus variants in the districts like Palghar, Thane, Sindhudurg, Mumbai, among others, where the variant has been recorded.“The variant has already spread to over 80 countries across the world, including the United Kingdom, United States of America, Singapore and southern China. It’s more transmissible and causes group infections. But so far, we haven’t observed any major spike in Delta Plus cases in any districts,” said Dr Subhas Salunke, state advisor to Covid-19 treatment. “So, it is essential that people get fully vaccinated and keep following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Keep wearing masks and before travelling, get fully vaccinated,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtras-delta-plus-cases-surge-to-45-from-21-in-june-101628446931449.html

08-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Chimbai fisherfolk clash over infrastructure development||Fisherfolk from Chimbai village in Bandra (West) have gotten into a heated dispute over the ongoing infrastructure development work along their waterfront executed by the fisheries department. The ₹8.5-crore project, which involves expansion of an existing jetty, construction of two new boatyards and two new net mending shelters, has also drawn the ire of environmentalists who said the work is in violation of permissions granted under the Coastal Regulatory Zone (CRZ) rules.The Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) had, on February 26, 2019, recommended the fisheries department’s proposal for CRZ clearance while the construction work commenced in August 2019. The project is being funded by the Central government and involves developing “infrastructural post harvesting facilities” at 10 different fish landing sites in the state. A rapid environment impact assessment (EIA) report carried out for the same noted that the work would “fulfil long-standing demand of about 2,525 fisherfolk residents in Chimbai”.While the project has faced opposition from a majority of fisherfolk, a smaller group of Chimbai residents — recently organised into the government registered Chimbai East Indian Koli Samaj Sanstha which claims to represent around 85 individuals — have supported the project. Revamping the existing infrastructure, they said, is necessary to revitalise trade in the village, particularly during the economic downturn after Covid-19.Residents highlight environmental concernsThe majority of residents HT spoke with maintained that they have never made such a demand in the first place. “There are not even 150 fishing boats left here anymore. This project will only damage our small beach further,” said Prakash Chimbaikar, whose family has been fishing at Chimbai for at least three generations. “Because of the jetty expansion and blasting of rocks to make way for the boatyard, the water is already coming further into the village during high tide. The boatyard is being constructed over rocks that halt the water from reaching our homes. Even the jetty expansion has been done in a way which does not allow water to flow back out as quickly during low tide,” he added.In a petition filed earlier this year before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) by Chimbai resident Maria Thelma against MCZMA, it has been noted that the scale of proposed amenities are “entirely disproportionate to the needs of the local community”, and are best “avoided at all costs due to the fragility of the geomorphic features of the intertidal rocky areas and mangroves in the region”. The petition also alleges that construction debris and raw materials are being dumped wantonly inside CRZ-I areas, which an HT team found to be true during multiple site visits in the past month.Speaking to HT, Thelma also said construction material was being stored in a common area that was earlier used for net mending and fish drying. “Ever since the work began, we are not able to use the area for drying fish. The area also touches a mangrove patch. The contractor has made sheds there for his staff and parks his machinery on site. Who has allowed our common areas to be taken over like this? Where is the permission?” she said.Project violates terms of clearance: ActivistsThe ongoing work in Chimbai has also come under the scanner of environmentalists who first wrote to authorities in January this year, pointing out lapses in the governance and execution of the project. The two proposed boatyards, as per the fisheries department’s layout plans, will involve reclamation of 45,000 sq ft of intertidal zone on the sea-ward side of Chimbai village, which is a CRZ-III area.These areas are marked as no development zones as per the CRZ Notification, 2011, and exceptions may be permitted only for reconstruction of “dwelling units of traditional coastal communities”, as per the CRZ rules. “About 190 metres of the 300-metre beach will be taken up by the project. This leaves very little open space left, and there has not been any detailed study on how the tidal influence will change. The way the project has been executed is quite shabby. Even MCZMA when granting clearance did not seem to be aware of the scale of the project. This increases room for violations which, as we can see, has already happened. Old, natural rocks which act as protective barrier between the sea and people’s homes have been destroyed,” said environmentalist Zoru Bhatena, who had first written to MCZMA in January this year, highlighting the project’s ecological impact. A perusal of the rapid EIA report prepared for the project, too, shows glaring lapses in the consultant’s risk assessment methods. For example, the report uses tidal pattern data not of Chimbai village but that of Apollo Bunder in Colaba when assessing the project’s risks on flow of tide water. “This is a blunder. Changes in the tide can completely change how we park and anchor our boats. If the flow becomes more intense, our boats will get damaged in choppy weather,” said Brian Falcon, a fisherman from Chimbai.Despite attempts, HT was unable to reach Narendra Toke director, environment and member secretary of MCZMA, for a comment. A fisheries officer privy to the project, requesting anonymity, said, “We have all permissions for the project. NGT has not stayed the work either, and has appointed a monitoring committee with members of the environment ministry and state pollution control board. Any queries should be taken up with them.”Infrastructure needed to revitalise fishing communityDespite the attendant environmental repercussions, not all residents are opposed to the development. Daven Kandoriya, chairman of Chimbai Matsyodyog Vividh Karyakari Sanstha and president of Chimbai East Indian Koli Samaj, said the development was essential for reviving the practice of artisanal fishing among the local community.“A boatyard will enable us to buy bigger boats, and we can also earn revenue by renting out the area for cultural events and festivals. We could start our own Koli food festival, establish a fish market and so on. It’s not as if we do not have adequate infrastructure today, but given the economic downturn and job squeeze, more people are coming back to fishing instead of doing other kinds of jobs. We need to be able to provide them with support,” said Kandoriya.Alan Misquita, 40, a fisherman from Chimbai, said the village currently suffers from a shortage of public space where the community can gather to conduct trade and discuss related affairs. “What is being built will continue to belong to the entire community. We have also asked for a third dhakka to be built. Each of the three Koli communities — Catholic, Maharastrian and Kathiyawadi — can have their own fish landing. We are acting in everyone’s interest,” he clarified.Asked if they were cognisant of the possible ecological ramifications of the proposed works, Kandoriya, Misquita and other members of the Samaj expressed faith in a recent order of NGT which allowed the work to continue while disposing Thelma’s petition. “The matter has been dismissed once earlier by the high court in January. If the courts had seen merit in their argument, we would have accepted. What some residents do not seem to understand is that if we cannot show enough infrastructure, tomorrow the village may get placed in some slum rehabilitation scheme. We are only trying to protect the koliwada,” said Valley Quadros, 46.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-chimbai-fisherfolk-clash-over-infrastructure-development-101628446812353.html

The site in question is opposite the Metro-3 casting yard on Jogeshwari-Vikhroli Link Road between Powai and SEEPZ. Initially flagged by Save Aarey activists in March this year, it is alleged that at least four acres of land along Mithi have been buried.“After we complained in March, the work stopped. It has now started again today. What was already reclaimed is expanding, and grasslands which fall in the catchment of Mithi are being buried. CMO has now directed the forest department to look into the matter. It’s reassuring that the forest department can now be roped in for protecting Aarey, but it remains to be seen whether they can stop the damage,” said Stalin D, director of NGO Vanashakti. On June 8, 812 acres of Aarey land were handed over to the forest department for protection.Sanjiv Valsan, an activist with Save Aarey and Rewilding Aarey movements, said scores of trucks have once again started coming to the plot which is marked as a green zone in development plans and have been dumping debris and mud in an organised manner. Valsan also shared videos taken on Sunday which show construction material being offloaded by labourers. “We have been told that the land was reserved for a 200-square metre petrol pump, but the landfill extends over a larger area than that. This will worsen flooding. There is no board outside the project either. We have filed a complaint with Aarey police but no action has been taken. This is illegal. Authorities should clarify who the contractor responsible for this is,” Valsan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cmo-asks-forest-department-to-look-into-landfilling-allegations-in-aarey-101628446631507.html

A meeting of the general manager (GM), Jal Sansthan, and the project manager, Jal Nigam, was organised to prepare a project report of the plan last week.Confirming this, general manager, Jal Sansthan, SK Varma said: “The Jal Nigam will start a survey of these villages from next week for laying pipelines. Besides, more than one lakh houses in the old city, which don’t have any water connection, will also be given water connection by laying new water lines in different areas of Lucknow. A plan for this is also being prepared. Presently, these areas are getting water supply through handpumps and submersible pumps.”Project manager, Jal Nigam, GC Srivastava said, “A proposal to lay water lines in those areas which still don’t have piped water supply is being prepared.” Besides, Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) is also planning development of all the 88 villages.The committee constituted by Lucknow Municipal Corporation has submitted the report recommending development of these villages with ₹100 crore. The report recommends laying of pipelines for piped water supply, installation of streetlights, development of parks, establishing community centres and laying of sewer lines.Chief tax superintendent, LMC, Ashok Singh said, “The good thing is that these villages have come with a good land bank for LMC which can be used for LMC projects in days to come. The area of LMC has increased from 310 sq km to 568 sq km . And this has come with added responsibilities.

08-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Over 1.2 million voters likely to be deleted from electoral rolls||Around 1.2 million registered voters are expected to be deleted from the electoral rolls for being absent from their residential address for various reasons. The district collectorates have been directed to ‘purify the rolls’ by following the due process.Maharashtra has 90.08 million voters registered to the electoral rolls across the state. Around 1.2 million voters were found missing from their registered residential addresses during the verification visit by the booth level officers appointed by the chief electoral officer of the state. Most of them had no photographs on their election cards. The chief executive officer (CEO) of Maharashtra on direction from the Election Commission of India (ECI) has asked district authorities to delete the names.Of the 90.08 million registered voters, many believed to have multiple entries in rolls because of the shifting of the residences. The migration from big cities like Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Pune to neighbouring cities is more resulting in duplicate entries of the voters. “This results in the drop in the voting percentage as it is taken on the registered voters and not on the actual living in the constituencies. One of the reasons for the low voting percentage in Mumbai and Thane is the duplicate voters prevailing in these cities. We call them ADS (absent, dead and shifted) voters and take a regular drive to purify or cleanse the electoral rolls. This is one such drive,” said an official from the CEO’s office.At 550,000, the highest ADS voters are in Thane, the district with a high migration rate. Mumbai suburban and Pune have more than 200,000 such voters, while Mumbai city and Nagpur have over 100,000 ADS voters.By using software, the ECI delete the demographical similar names from the rolls from time to time after due verification. “We conduct two summary revisions per year for the addition and deletions of the voters and insist on the photographs of voters in the rolls. Dead persons are deleted from the list by obtaining data from the authorities concerned. Most of these ADS voters have no photographs in the rolls, which clearly indicate that they have not been staying at the address for long. They have been given due time to comply with the discrepancies and on their failure to respond, we have been deleting the names,” the officer said.“We had 118,000 names without the photographs on the election cards in Mumbai city. On verification we found them missing from the address. After an appeal, around 1,000 of them have responded with their photographs and details within the deadline. For remaining voters, the deletion process has started. The names are being deleted by conducting punchanamas and verification from the neighbours and booth level agents appointed by political parties. Even if any valid voter is deleted erroneously, he/she will always have an opportunity to re-register by filing Form 6,” said Rajeev Nivatkar, collector, Mumbai city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaiover-1-2-million-voters-likely-to-be-deleted-from-electoral-rolls-101628444831536.html

To keep 30-year-old Jitpal Singha alive, they have had to pay ₹1.5 lakh every day for the Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation or ECMO machine for the last one month, according to NDTV. Doctors have said that Singha needs to remain on the machine, which pumps and oxygenates his blood outside the body so that his heart and lungs can rest, for another 30 days.But his family is concerned about funds drying up. His mother, Alpana Singha, said that when she last met her son he showed her a victory sign. She said that her son keeps asking about returning home. "He can't speak as he has all these pipes in his throat. But as I was leaving, he indicated I should take a photo of him," she told NDTV.The report said that his father has been unable to face the problems presented due to his son’s hospitalisation and has been visiting an ashram to cope up. Jitpal Singha’s cousin Debanjan Burman along with his friends is racing against time to secure the funds for his treatment. Jitpal's friends have chipped in generously to ensure his recovery and raised nearly ₹40 lakh. But now Burman said he worried because they will not be left with any money within 10 days.Nitish Vyas, a childhood friend of Jitpal, has also started a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for his treatment but points out the difficulties. "No family is prepared for this. It's a difficult scenario, an impossible scenario we are in, but we are not giving up," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/covid-patient-needs-rs-1-5-lakh-daily-for-treatment-family-expresses-concern-101628442749633.html

08-08-2021||Patna||Patna’s Ganga pathway to partially open in March next year||The 5.50km-long Digha-AN Sinha Institute stretch of the ambitious Ganga Pathway, considered Patna’s version of Mumbai’s famous Marine Drive, will be opened for vehicular traffic by March next year, officials said on Sunday. This is part of ₹3,390 crore signature project coming up on the southern bank of River Ganga to minimise traffic load on the congested Ashok Rajpath. Envisoned by Nitish Kumar during his second stint as the chief minister, the road construction department (RCD) in 2013 laid the foundation stone of the 20.50km four-lane expressway, that connects National Highway-30 and AIIMS-Digha elevated corridor in the west with the upcoming six-lane Kacchi Dargah-Bidupur bridge over River Ganga in Patna City in the east. The project, however, got delayed inordinately owing to multiple reasons, including procedural wrangle in land acquisition and design modifications. Founded in 2013, the project was scheduled to be completed in 2017. However, as all the issues affecting the project are now tackled with, the RCD is now aiming to complete the project by June 2023. RCD additional chief secretary Amrit Lal Meena said efforts were on to open the Digha-AN Sinha institute stretch, which connects with Ashok Rajpath through a bridge, by March next year. “Most of the construction on this stretch is being done at grade level, while a short span of it is on elevated structure,” he said, adding that fund issues have also been resolved as the state Cabinet gave its nod for taking ₹2,000 crore as loan from Housing and Urban Development Corporation (Hudco). The RCD has arranged rest of the project cost from the state government’s resources, Meena said after a Cabinet meeting, which cleared the department’s proposal at its meeting chaired by chief minister Nitish Kumar on Friday last. In another important decision to empower youths with industrial skills, the state Cabinet approved the industries department’s proposal for launching vocational training institute of Central Institute of Petrochemicals and Engineering Technology (CIPET), and building premises of Bhagalpur co-operative spinning mill at a cost of around ₹40.10 crore. An assistance grant of ₹10 crore has also been released to start the project in the current fiscal. The Cabinet also gave its approval for release of around ₹30,000 crore to be spent by urban and rural local bodies towards development work. The allotment of fund will be made by the finance department to Panchayati raj and urban development departments in the light of the sixth state finance commission. The state government has also decided to frame rules, including qualifications, for appointment of chairman, members and member-secretary of Bihar state pollution control board. Currently, the board is running on an ad-hoc arrangement, as terms of present office-bearers expired last year.

The two-member commission includes Justice (retired) Jainarayan Patel and former chief secretary of Maharashtra, Sumit Mullick. Some of the claims made by a retired income tax officer from the family that claims to be a descendent of Dalit warrior Govind Gopal Mahar, created some loopholes in the narrative of events that occurred in the run-up to the violence in January 2018, and its immediate aftermath.Pralhad Ishwar Gaikwad (63), the man who claims to be a descendant of Govind Gopal Mahar, has claimed that he is not aware of who affixed the board whose vandalism led to unrest in Vadhu Budrukh village in December 2017. The board credited Govind Gopal with performing the last rites on the mortal remains of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj. The contents of the board disputed an opposing belief of the Maratha community that it was their ancestors, and not Mahar, who had performed the last rites on Sambhaij Maharaj, after his body was desecrated by Mughal emperor Aurangazeb.The Gaikwad family and the Maratha community got into a fight after the desecration of the board and the memorial. Rekha Shivale, the former sarpanch of Vadhu Budrukh has submitted a video of the fight that ensued between the Dalit Gaikwad family and members of the Maratha community.Additionally, Gaikwad blamed the then deputy sarpanch of Vadhu Budrukh village, Santosh Shivale, for misleading him into signing an affidavit that claimed that the memorial was only two-three years old.He claimed that he had been visiting the samadhi since his childhood, even though there is no record of its existence before the unrest happened in 2017.During his cross questioning by Advocate MV Deshmukh on August 2, Gaikwad claimed that the memorial and his family house were washed away in the 1997 floods, and that it was reconstructed, without his permission, in 2015-2016, on a site that was different than its original location.On August 3, during cross-questioning by Advocate BG Bansode, he said, “Govind Gopal Mahar was our ancestor. His samadhi is situated near the open plot, ie, in the buffer zone of CTS No 283. I am seeing the samadhi since my childhood. My father and grandfather used to tell us that in our family, Govind Gopal Mahar was a well-known warrior.”This statement went directly against the claim that was made in his earlier affidavit in June 2018, and in a hand-written letter he had submitted to the gram panchayat in May 2018. A revised affidavit was submitted by him in October 2018, rectifying this claim.Furthermore, Gaikwad added that he was not aware of who had reconstructed the memorial in 2015-16, or who had installed the board on the night intervening December 28-29, 2017. However, he does stake a claim on the sole ownership of the land on which the current memorial stands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bhima-korgegaon-commission-narrative-of-events-disputed-by-dalit-s-testimony-101628442550595.html

The posters put up by youth JD(U) president Abhay Kushwaha had pictures of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, RCP Singh and other leaders. The conspicuous absence of Lalan Singh’s picture from the poster did raise eyebrows and sent across a message about internal friction within the party between the newly elected JD(U) president and his predecessor.The posters came up just two days after JD(U) national president Lalan Singh was given a rousing welcome in the state capital, which was seen more as a show of strength by the Munger MP.However, most of the posters were removed from the party office and other places by the afternoon after the party’s state leaders took strong exception to it. Umesh Kushwaha, JD(U) state president, said that the absence of JD(U) national president from the posters was a breach of protocol and those responsible for it would be facing action. “We will send show-cause to the persons responsible for this. If their reply is not satisfactory, they will face action,” the JD(U) state president said. On his part, Abhay Kushwaha called the incident a mistake.Tejashwi missing from RJD postersMeanwhile, some eyebrows were also raised over posters put up outside the RJD state office by the youth wing of the party, in which large images of former health minister and Hasanpur MLA Tej Pratap Yadav were visible while pictures of the leader of the opposition Tejashwi Yadav were missing. There are speculations that Tej Pratap, who has been critical of the state president Jagdanand Singh, is keen on playing more assertive in the party and trying to increase his clout to compete with his younger brother Tejashwi who has gained acceptance as the party’s face.Tej Pratap, during a party’s youth wing meeting, took potshots at the state president Jagdanand Singh again, saying that some people are acting on their whims and fancies and have introduced a ‘system’ in the party due to which people are not able to come freely to the state office. “This party belongs to all and not a fiefdom of few people. That is why I have become active to bring in the same old vibrancy in the party so that people do not act arbitrarily,” he said.About the missing photo of Tejashwi Yadav from the party’s posters, Tej Pratap said, “Why are you all bothered about pictures. Tejashwi is in my heart. He is our chief ministerial face,” Yadav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/party-posters-without-jd-u-national-chief-s-pictures-trigger-row-101628442371249.html

Citizens having illegal water connections need to file a written application with their name, address, property details and contact number mentioned. Only water connections having a width of less than one inch will be regularised.” Upon submission of the application, the concerned zone will verify the documents and initiate the regularisation process, as per the water department.With the PMC fixing nominal charges for regularisation, the civic body is expecting more citizens to come forward to regularise their illegal water connections.

Dissatisfied lots are requested to take part in the written examination as decided by the board.Every school was in a state of complete helplessness due to the instructions issued by CBSE. “Many good and meritorious students had to be marked less based on the CBSE evaluation formula this year because of the board’s direction to refer to the results of last three years before granting the marks,” alleged many speakers at the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cbse-results-row-all-schools-were-bound-to-follow-board-s-guidelines-say-pscwa-officials-101628441831127.html

The caller told the complainant that her SIM card was going to be deactivated unless she completes some procedure, according to her complaint.“The man first asked them to transfer a small amount, so she transferred ₹10.

Once the woman realised that the SIM card was functional, she approached the police.A case under Sections 419 (personation), 420 (cheating), 34 (Common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) along with Sections 66(c) and 66(d) of Information Technology Act has been registered at the Deccan police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/65yearold-woman-duped-of-5-lakh-by-caller-who-told-her-sim-card-about-to-expire-101628441770519.html

Patna’s contribution was 27% of the state’s achievement of 509,447 doses administered on Saturday. “We surpassed Bengaluru (88,327), Ahmedabad (55,988), Mumbai (53,988), Belgaum (49,513), Kurnool (49,203), Surat (48,691), Dehradun (44,495) and Chennai (41,357) in terms of Covid jabs on Saturday,” said Patna’s district magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh. “We also earned the unique distinction to join the elite club of five districts in India to cross the 1 lakh mark of Covid-19 vaccinations in a single day,” he added. Indore, with 227,349 doses in a day, tops the list of such districts, followed by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (173,960), Bhopal (156,137) and Ujjain (105,314). Patna has now administered 95% first dose vaccination to its urban adult population and 33% to the rural masses. The district’s first-dose achievement was 53% against the state’s 32%. The district has administered 1,361,533 doses to its 4,349,131 target population so far. Patna had achieved 18% full immunisation against the state’s 6% coverage of the target population of 7.22 crore to have taken both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, said Dr SP Vinayak, Patna’s district immunisation officer. The 17 special vaccination centres in Patna, incepted in May and June, had administered 902,277 doses of the 1,361,533 doses till Saturday. Of this, the three vaccination centres at the Patliputra Sports Complex, Patliputra Ashok hotel and the Government Polytechnic college in Patliputra that operate 24x7 accounted for 41% (370,845) doses. These three centres are managed by Care India, which provides technical support to the state government in the implementation of the health programme. Patna had 262 vaccination sessions on Saturday. “There is no hesitancy anywhere now. People from rural areas are calling up our field officers to know about the availability of vaccines in their respective areas. Now that we have almost saturated the urban areas, we shall turn our attention to vaccination in rural areas from August 10,” said Singh, in response to the vaccine hesitancy in rural areas, which had led to low first-dose coverage (33%). “In addition to the 86 “Teeka Express” or mobile vaccine vans, we have four special vans, which will have vaccinators, data-entry operators, as well as artists who will perform street plays to sensitise people about vaccination in a handful of remote areas where people are delaying taking their jab. In addition, we will also take help from NGOs working in those areas,” he added. Though chief minister Nitish Kumar has set a target for his officers to complete Covid-19 vaccination in the state by December, Patna hopes to do it before the given deadline, subject to the availability of vaccines..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/patna-is-fifth-in-india-to-complete-1-lakh-covid-jabs-in-a-day-101628441531032.html

Fire brigade officials needed one-and-a-half hour to douse the fire, according to an official. The incident happened in Kopare gaon, Uttam nagar.The deceased have been identified as Brijesh KEshavnagarayn Sahani (21), and the injured man is Sanjay Rampreet Sahani (37). Sahani owned and ran a welding and painting business, according to said senior police inspector Vaishali Chandgude of Uttam nagar police station. They were both natives of Uttar Pradesh.The two were rushed to Sassoon General Hospital while the fire brigade department doused the fire. While the 21-year-old died of burn injuries, the other man is undergoing treatment for burns.“They both lived in that shed. They owned and ran a painting and welding business. The chemical is suspected to be thinner used for painting. There were around 8-10 barrels but, we are not sure how many of them contained the liquid. The younger one was a cousin of the injured man. We registered an accidental death report, but now we have begun the process of registering an offence,” said senior PI Chandgude.The fire that started in a shed, consumed a car that was parked in a garage, and two luxury buses which were parked in an open space adjoining the garage, according to Gajanan Patrudkar, official of the fire department.“There was a shed of around 1200-1500 square feet in which there were multiple barrels full of petro-chemical liquid. No idea what they were doing with it in that shed or how the fire started. When we reached, the people had already pulled them out and taken them to the hospital. There were two fire tenders from Pune city and two from PMRDA. We needed two tankers. The barrels were individually causing explosions and the shed was blocking our dousing foam. So, we had to pull the fallen roof and then pull out the burning barrels before the fire could be doused completely,” said the fire brigade official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/1-dead-1-severely-burnt-after-shed-with-petro-chem-products-catches-fire-101628441290572.html

We cannot stop people who have hotel bookings and that is one reason we are witnessing a heavy rush,” said Dilip Pawar, senior inspector, in charge of Lonavla city police station.The demand to re-open specific tourist spots in Lonavla and Khandala, currently closed to visitors due to Covid restrictions, has also begun to be made by businesses and tour operators in the area.On Sunday, the district administration recorded three fresh Covid cases in Lonavla, taking the total number of active cases in the city to 39.“Covid-19 is not increasing in Lonavla. The aim of the administration is to bring the number down to zero. It is very hard to determine whether tourists who are visiting hill stations are spreaders or not. They could only be mild spreaders, because if one has been detected with the symptoms then the person is not allowed to enter city,” said Dr Sourabh Gharde, medical officer, urban primary health centre, Lonavla.“More people will visit if Section 144. Business has been hugely affected. Now the situation is under control and the administration should support the locals from the hill station,” said Samir Ingale, member, Lonavla- Khandala hotel association.“We are appealing people to follow Covid protocols strictly since there is an anticipation of a third wave.

Cases of heart attack or heart failure in Covid-19 recovered patients within three months of recovery are rising, say doctors. To keep the heart healthy, post-Covid, patients should go for a regular cardiac screening every six months, stick to a healthy diet, stay physically active and take medication, as suggested by the doctor.Experts have often found that although Covid-19 is primarily a lung infection, it is known to leave an impact on other organs as well, including the cardiac system. The high levels of inflammation in the body during covid19 treatment as the body’s immune system fights the virus can cause complications outside the lungs too. In some cases it was found that those who had not reported any cardiac issues before the Covid-19 infection reported cardiac issues after recovering from the infection.Dr Pramod Narkhede, cardiologist at Apollo Clinic said, “After getting infected with coronavirus, patients encounter chest pain, myocarditis (inflammation of heart muscle), heart attack, heart failure, blood clotting, arrhythmia (abnormal heartbeat), and stroke. These problems may be seen after recovery from the Covid infection. It was observed that 78 of 100 patients diagnosed with the infection reported symptoms of heart damage and inflammation.” “Mainly young adults and elderly patients are suffering from this. Many people experience shortness of breath, chest pain or palpitations. Any of these problems could be related to the heart, but they could also be due to other factors, including the aftermath of being very ill, prolonged inactivity and spending weeks convalescing in bed. Six of 10 patients seen in the OPD, who did not have pre-existing heart problems, have post-Covid cardiac symptoms. Those who have pre-existing heart problems should be cautious and have regular medications and follow ups. Regularly checking and medical attention can prevent lethal complications,” said Dr Narkhede.Dr Keerthi Prakash Kotla, consultant pathologist at a city laboratory in Pune said, “Those who have developed chest pain post-Covid recovery or those who have already suffered from heart problems and have got infected with Covid-19 should go for cardiac tests to know the functioning of the heart. ECG, X-Ray chest and lipid profile and should be repeated after six months in high-risk individuals with pre-existing conditions like diabetes and hypertension .These tests will help to determine whether there is any damage to the heart. Don’t forget to go for regular follow-ups too”.Dr Amit Sinkar, cardiologist at Lokmanya Hospital in Pune, said, “Currently, many post-Covid patients are encountering various heart problems. Heart beat irregularities and heart failure are seen in patients usually within three months of recovering from Covid. Heart failure can develop due to myocardial inflammation (Which can happen after any viral infection), or worsening of existing Cardiomyopathy (impairment of heart pumping function). Incidences of blood clots in blood vessels of heart and brain are increased after getting infected with Covid-19. This often leads to heart attacks and strokes (Paralysis) due to poor blood supply to the heart and brain, respectively. Currently, we have patients with increased heart rates after recovering from Covid. These patients need constant monitoring and follow up.”Dr Dhanesh Kamarkar, consultant cardiovascular surgeon at Ruby Hall Clinic said, “Yes we are seeing a rise in the number of complaints related to clotting in the legs, abdomen and arteries among Covid-19 recovered patients. Clotting problems in the arteries are among those with predisposed factors like diabetes, high cholesterol, and chronic kidney disease. This rise in numbers is more evident following the second wave as we did not see so many cases in the first wave. Also during the second wave we did see use of steroids. Most of the clotting cases are reported in middle-aged or senior patients, but a few also in younger patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/doctors-report-spike-in-cases-of-covid-recoveries-with-heart-problems-101628440270450.html

These 79 villages fall in 12 different talukas and have been listed as hypersensitive to the infection given a rising number of confirmed cases of Dengue and Chikungunya in the last three years. As of Saturday, the district administration has surveyed six villages, including Belasar, which reported the first Zika virus case on July 30. As pregnant women are thought to be most affected by the infection, 99 pregnant women in these villages have been surveyed till now, with blood samples sent to the NIV,The collector in his order issued on August 5 states that these 79 villages would be on a list of surveillance for the infection. The administration will keep a tab on all these villages which are located in Junnar, Khed, Ambegaon, Shirur, Daund, Indapur, Haveli, Velha, Mulshi, Baramati, Purandar and Bhor. A total of 158 blood smear samples have been sent to the NIV. None of the pregnant women who have been surveyed has been found to be symptomatic. As of now, only one confirmed case of Zika virus has been reported. A survey of all the houses located in six villages, including Belasar is ongoing. Samples of anyone reported to have the flu are being sent to the National Institute of Virology for further testing. These six villages include Belssar, Kothle, Walunje, Nilunje, Khanwadi and Pargaon in Purandar tehsil. The symptoms of the Zika infection include fever, rashes on the body, conjunctivitis, weakness, and headache which could last for up to seven days. Eighty per cent of the patients infected are asymptomatic. If pregnant women are infected with Zika virus then it could lead to microcephaly, a condition where the baby’s head is much smaller than expected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/79-villages-hypersensitive-to-zika-virus-dist-collector-101628440090445.html

Dr Awate said, “We sent 8,000 samples for genome sequencing of which only 45 have tested positive for this variant, which is not even one per cent. We have also found that the districts of concern have reported only one sample each, except for Ratnagiri, which has reported 11 samples.

Along with Pune, Ahmednagar is also becoming a district of concern, reporting an RTPCR positivity rate of 7.0%, the highest in the state for that week.Experts have repeatedly said that the RTPCR positivity rate gives the right picture of the spread of the infection, as rapid antigen tests could give false negatives at times. Pune’s RTPCR positivity at 5.8% is still a matter of concern.

He said that he takes Pune-related decisions with the chief minister’s permission and on being asked about Pune-related decisions, “Pune’s guardian minister will decide after discussing with the CM,” said Pawar.“While taking decisions related to Pune I ask the CM. So if someone asks others (ministers) anything about Pune, they can say that the guardian minister will take a decision after consulting with CM,” said Ajit Pawar. Pawar also asserted that when it comes to analysing Covid indicators, the state government recognises Pune as a single district and not as three different administrative units. “In Maharashtra, every district is known as a district. Pune district is very diversified in terms of geography. The state government considers it a single district. When I got to know about the situation, I spoke to the CM and requested him to consider the ground situation in Pune. Then CM spoke to the divisional commissioner, collector, municipal commissioners, and commissioners of police. Then he again talked to me. After all this, we have arrived at this decision. The population of the Pune district is huge as compared to the other districts. Now also, we have kept the rural parts at level 3,” said Pawar. The state’s government’s order on the five-level unlock plan had categorically mentioned the municipal corporations were to be considered as separate administrative units, including Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC). Based on the Covid indicators given in the order, level 3 restrictions were put in pace for PMC and PCMC, and level 4 restrictions were imposed in rural parts. As the positivity rate further declined in PMC, more relaxations were offered only in PMC for a brief period, before level 3 was made the baseline for restrictions, fearing the transmissibility of delta plus variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/i-take-decisions-related-to-pune-consulting-the-cm-ajit-pawar-101628439310423.html

As our Covid cases have drastically gone down, there should be relaxation given and it has finally happened. State government officials told us to get both doses of the vaccines given to our staff, but it is not possible as there is gap between two doses. Whereas 90 per cent of staff has taken the first dose, we strictly follow all the SOPs given by the state government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/huge-sigh-of-relief-as-pune-traders-welcome-easing-of-curbs-101628439130575.html

With an exceptional journey, Mishra has inspired film maker Manoj Tiwari to direct her biopic. The 49-year-old athlete says, “The director, who had earlier made P se Pyaar F Se Faraar based on a javelin player, has come down to sign a contract with me for the biopic. Scripting is on and now they are zeroing on an actor who can essay my role as mine is a sports journey of a fat to fit so it needs a lot of transformation.” She feels Alia Bhatt, Taapsee Pannu, Anushka Sharma or any newcomer can play her character. “Initially I was 54 kgs which reached to 89 kgs due to illness and then reduced to 62 kgs.” Giving an insight of her journey she says, “I belong to Basti and before marriage (1995), I played 12 nationals and my record for inter-university in UP of 100 m in 12 seconds is still unbroken. Then, I left sports and got busy with my family, son and government job. After miscarriage, I developed medical conditions and nearly had a kidney failure, sugar, BP, asthma with heart and intestine problem.” Warned by doctors, in 2008, she realised that she really wants to be back on track. “In three months, I made a turnaround. In January 2009, I bagged gold medal in national game (35 plus age category) held at Hissar and in July won bronze medal in World Masters Athletic Championship, Finland.” Currently, she plays in 45 plus category and from next year will play 50 plus. She has won 79 medals and feels had lockdown not happened the tally today would have clocked 100. She last won 2 gold and 1 silver in Imphal (2020), while in Malaysia (2019) she bagged a gold medal. Mishra inspired many in the city too. “I started my club and soon girls and boys started joining in, even from Naxalite area. Many of them have won medals, got government job and some had opened academy and even become coach. It was tough as I had to convince family and answer patriarchal society, but I had to do it,” says the Rani Laxmibai awardee. Elated with the India’s performance in Olympic she says, “I am very happy that men did well but happier that girls have made us so proud. Being a sportsperson, I know besides sports they have to put up a fight in every stage of life. The medal haul will be an inspiration for female sportsperson and parents.” Mishra is working hard for national championship to be held later this year and the Asian and World Championship next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/coming-up-biopic-on-athlete-s-comeback-story-101628431151576.html

08-08-2021||Pune||Curtain call: One scene, one set-change and a watershed moment for Marathi theatre||The opening day of ‘Amar Photo Studio’ was only a few days away. We had been rehearsing for nearly three months now and were eager to show the play to the world. But, I was still dealing with one problem.As mentioned in my previous articles, the story of the play was about time travel. The story of the play was pretty unique when it came to commercial Marathi theatre which is usually confined to a single location – the living room of a house. We had made some unusual choices, in all departments. But, they weren’t made for the sake of being unusual. That is what the play required and I had the full support of my producers.The extensive rehearsal allowed me to experiment with the format of the play and also its technical aspects. We had tried to make hydraulic sets and had also toyed around with the idea of using a projector. There were many magical moments in the play and I did not want to lose them or change them only because I couldn’t execute it. Everything else had fallen in place. We had left the idea of hydraulic sets behind after realising that the infrastructure of our auditoriums was not ready for it. With my previous experience of working with projectors in plays, I had given up on that idea too. I had found simple, elegant solutions to every other problem. And these solutions only underlined my love for the beauty of theatre. It was during this process that I realised that it was only in this medium that I could pass the onus of believability to the audience when it came to complicated scenes. I need not “show” everything, but make the audience “believe” that they have seen it. And that made a world of difference.And that is how gradually I came to the solution of the last problem – changing the set mid- scene. As mentioned before, the set was changed during blackouts by backstage artists. This particular scene warranted that the set be changed while a scene was being performed and seeing the set changed by backstage artistes would have taken away its essence.In the previous scene, the protagonists are being chased by the police. So at a specific cue, when they are being chased, I asked the actors to climb down the stage. The remainder of the scene was performed with the audience! Since there wasn’t any important dialogue in that sequence, the audience sitting in the last rows wouldn’t miss any information too. The actors were told to improvise while they were in the audience. So naturally, everyone was looking at the scene unfold.Meanwhile, backstage artistes would come on stage in dim light and change the set. But nobody would be looking at them! Again, on cue, the actors would go on stage to a changed location. It was that simple and hardly took a minute. Also, while improvising, the actors were told to interact with some members of the audience while staying in character.When the play opened this particular segment received a tremendous response. I was pleasantly surprised to see the audience accept this with open arms. They loved the fact that the actors were performing so close to them. And the actors interacting with them was a cherry on the cake.When the play opened, it received an extremely positive response. Both, from the audience and the critics. Its marketing strategy was also regarded as a gamechanger for advertising Marathi plays. We all noticed that some audience members were still terming the play as “bold”. We knew that it was a different play, but did not understand this particular tag. Sunil Barve, our producer, rightly identified one instance in the play, that was hardly a few seconds long, but made a majority of the audience think that. More on that next week.Nipun Dharmadhikari is a storyteller and looks forward to telling stories, on stage, in front of the camera, or in person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-one-scene-one-set-change-and-a-watershed-moment-for-marathi-theatre-101628423230874.html
08-08-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan Asha worker rows boat in tough condition to vaccinate island residents||No hurdle is too big for Corona warriors such as Kamla Rot, an ASHA (accredited social health activist) know as ‘Sehyoginis’ in Dungarpur district of Rajasthan, who rowed a boat fighting unfavourable conditions to reach a tribal village located on an island in the middle of swollen Mahi river to ensure that the inhabitants were vaccinated against the deadly coronavirus.33-year-old, Kamla’s official duty was limited to informing and motivating tribal villagers about the need to attend to health and family welfare, but she went beyond to take four nursing staff to the island village by rowing the boat in challenging conditions without any help for about 45 minutes. After about 90 residents of Odaphala village were vaccinated, she rowed the staff back safely. It was her commitment to the cause that ensured that residents of the two islands - Odaphala and Betphala in Salakhadi village area under Seemalwada block of Dungarpur district, who were finding it difficult to reach the nearest primary health centre due to increased water level in the river and were also a bit hesitant about the vaccination drive, were vaccinated in time. There are 23 houses on Odaphala island and nine on Betphala. Medical officer at [which] primary health centre Dr Chandraveer Parmar said the medical team’s bid to reach Odaphala island failed in its first attempt due to strong winds upsetting the boat’s balance in the river swollen due to monsoon rains.In such a challenging situation, Kamala offered to row the boat on the second attempt the following day, when the rest of the team was apprehensive of taking the boat trip. She took them safely to the island after paddling the boat for close to an hour and then played her part in motivating several hesitant villagers to get vaccinated, clearing their misconceptions about Covid vaccines. Mother of two, Kamla said she too had to overcome fear before taking the trip under the circumstances but she realised that vaccinating people was a big responsibility. “The people on the Island had their misconceptions related to the vaccine, but we also had to overcome increasing water level in the river, which was threatening to derail the vaccination drive. But once the health staff was prepared to take [the trip] then there was no turning back,” she said. Not much of a smooth talker, Kamla said she learnt to row a boat from her fisherman husband after her marriage in 2006. “Even I have relatives on the island. They were refusing to get vaccinated, so I took the nurses there and they had to get it done.” “I have never had a bad experience in the river but during the monsoon and when water is released from the dam, few incidents have happened in the past. I know how to swim and we live near water (river bank) and sometimes also go fishing,” she said. Block chief medical officer, Simalwada, Dr Narendra Prajapat said a total of 137 people live in 32 houses on Odaphala and Bedphala islands that are surrounded by water throughout the year. While people routinely travel by paddle boat, high volume of water and strong winds in the rainy season stops their movement. It was a challenging task to reach the people living on both the islands for vaccination in these conditions but the Corona Warriors were still doing it with full dedication, he claimed. District collector Suresh Kumar Ola said the spirit shown by Kamla was commendable. Her effort was also lauded by chief medical health officer (CMHO) Dr Rajesh Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-asha-worker-rows-boat-in-tough-condition-to-vaccinate-island-residents-101628415249512.html

Not just that, the police said at least three more assassinations in Bihar were linked to plots hatched inside the national capital’s Tihar jail.A member of Santosh Jha’s gang has told Bihar police that the plan to eliminate the property dealer was chalked out by Vikash Jha alias Kalia, a gangster lodged in Tihar Jail who was once a close associate of dreaded gangster Santosh Jha, who was killed while serving a life term in the murder case of two engineers while appearing in a Sitamarhi court on August 28, 2018 in connection with one of the 20 criminal cases he faced.Police said Kalia used Whatsapp to contact other key members of the gang outside the jail, Vishal Jha alias Raja and Vijay Jha, from inside the Tihar jail. His associates created a Facebook Page “Book-Bro” to chat with each other and Kalia frequently spoke to them using Whatsapp since February this year.Police said that two sharp shooters later identified as Kanhaiya Singh and Abhishek @ Mukul Mishra gunned down Nawal on June 30 on the busy Sitamarhi-Muzaffarpur national highway after forcing him to stop his bike in Ahiyapur police station area of Muzaffarpur district. The assailants spent about a minute at the spot after the first shot, firing repeatedly to make sure that Nawal was dead.Muzaffarpur police chief (SSP) Jayant Kant told HT that three criminals including one Ayush Singh of Sitamarhi, who were involved in the murder, have been arrested and sent to judicial custody.Ayush confessed that he was tasked with tracking Nawal’s movement by Kalia’s men identified as Raja, Abhishek and Kanhaiya, who had rented a house in March near the Medical overbridge at Muzaffarpur to carry out his killing. He also named some other criminals identified as Babul and Raghu, who he claimed were also placed by a tea stall near zero mile on the Sitamarhi-Muzaffarpur national highway for two months to track Nawal Singh’s movements, police said.Nawal’s wife Sadhana Devi later told police that her husband and son used to receive threats from a Facebook page named Book Bro, which carried pictures of AK-47.SSP) Jayant Kant said police had written to Facebook requesting information about the page used to issue threats and allegedly plot the murder. “So far, the conspirators and shooters, numbering around 10-15, are absconding. Raids are on,” the SSP added.Jayant Kant also revealed that Kalia was also a prime accused in the murder of Nawal’s brother Srinarayan Singh, a JDR candidate. JDR was part of the Upendra Kushwaha-led political alliance that included Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM and BSP. Srinarayan was shot dead along with a supporter in Sheohar’s Hathsar village during the assembly poll campaign on October 25, 2020. Nawal Kishore Singh was apparently a witness to his brother’s murder and had vowed to avenge it.The then Sheohar superintendent of police (SP), Santosh Kumar, currently posted at Saran, said his investigation had revealed Vikash Jha’s hand in Srinarayan Singh’s murder and he had twice written to Tihar authorities with mobile number, apparently used by Jha to plot the murder from behind the bars.During the probe into Nawal’s assassination, police claims to have also got clues to the murders of advocate Rajesh Ranjan alias Mani Jha, who was killed on June 16 at Sitamarhi, and the son of a school owner Awadhesh Jha, who was gunned down on May 16 at Dostiyan village under Purnahiya police station in Sheohar district. They say both these murders were also planned from inside the Tihar jail, however, they were not ready to divulge the details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-police-s-murder-probe-reveals-a-string-of-killings-planned-from-tihar-jail-101628404809485.html

08-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi CP wants DCPs to visit crime spots, dominate streets against urban crime||Delhi Police Commissioner Rakesh Asthana has directed that district DCPs must visit the crime spot in case of heinous crimes and has asked for police domination of streets to prevent urban crimes like chain snatching and robberies. Within days of taking over as CP, Delhi, Asthana has plans to rationalise higher ranks and bifurcate law and order, and criminal investigation so that police officers have specific tasks and not shunted around on the basis of tasks.No policeperson shall face any difficulty for bonafide discharge of duty and the senior leadership has to take care of the force as mentors and not find faults with them unnecessarily Asthana said. In a video address which was attended by 14,000 police staff, the new CP said Delhi Police have taken several initiatives on technological intervention in field policing. Time has come for evidence-based policing and scientific investigation as that's how cases would result in a conviction, he said.Briefing the force ahead of Independence Day, the CP said that Delhi police should draft in a big way the cooperation of street vendors, small shop keepers, auto drivers, rickshawalas etc to be the “eyes and ears against terrorist or criminal designs." These common people on the ground can be vigilant to act as our ‘force multipliers’ and form a part of our community policing to keep the city safe and secure with greater public cooperation and participation, Asthana said. Talking about communal harmony in the national Capital, the new CP said that this is an issue of utmost importance and the police have to engage with leaders of all communities. There should be no partial treatment to criminals of any community, Asthana said reminding the force that criminals do not have any religion or community.In his address, he also hinted that on a pilot basis law and order and investigation functions can be separated in police stations. Three duty shifts in select police stations will also commence on a pilot basis, the CP hinted.Complainants, victims and visitors to police stations should be treated politely and empathetically by giving time and attention to them, Asthana told the SHOs. Visitors to the city get their first impression from the traffic situation and hence the traffic department has the responsibility to give the best impression of the Delhi Police, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cp-wants-dcps-to-visit-crime-spots-dominate-streets-against-urban-crime-101628401567093.html

08-08-2021||Chandigarh||Nutritional awareness needed among lactating mothers, finds PAU study||The department of food and nutrition of the College of Community Science of Punjab Agricultural University surveyed 120 children and their mothers during World Breastfeeding Week. Breastfeeding week is celebrated every year in August from 1 to 7 to create awareness among mothers about the importance of breastfeeding.During the survey, it was found that 6.5% of children had low weight for height, 40% had low weight-for-age, and 61.5% had low height-for-age which reflects under nutrition.The results depicted that 41% of the total number of mothers exclusively breastfed their infants for the first six months, while only 5.5% of mothers introduced complementary foods at the age of six months, and 59% of mothers continued breastfeeding up to two years.Dr Jaswinder Kaur Brar informed that the department surveyed 120 mothers including, 60 from rural and 60 from urban areas of the district.Out of the total 120 mothers, it was found that only 32 knew about complementary feeding practices and most of them did not apply the knowledge they have.The study recommends that it is important to impart knowledge and create awareness regarding breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices.“The department observed that the practice of giving honey, glucose, jaggery as first feed (Gurti) was still prevalent in both rural and urban areas. It causes infections like diarrhoea in the new-borns and delays the early initiation of breastfeeding,” said Dr Brar.She added that poor hygiene is another cause of infection among children during breastfeeding.DMC&H observes World Breastfeeding WeekThe gynae seminar room of Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMC&H) observed World Breastfeeding Week.During the programme, health benefits of breastfeeding for mothers were discussed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nutritional-awareness-needed-among-lactating-mothers-finds-pau-study-101628375587500.html

The residents of street numbers 7, 8, and 9 rued that they have been facing trouble due to accumulated sewer water in the streets for the last few months but, the authorities have failed to resolve the issue despite repeated complaints. They stated that the filthy sewer water also enters the houses in the area, and its accumulation is turning the area into a breeding ground for mosquitoes.Deepak Uppal, councillor Kitty Uppal’s husband, said,” A dyeing unit is situated in the area, and the sewer lines overflow due to waste being dumped by the owner of that unit into the MC sewer lines. We have submitted complaints with MC but to no avail.”“We were also working on installing a sewer line at Shingar Cinema Disposal Point, but the councillor of the adjoining ward is not allowing us to do that, as the sewer line has to be installed through his ward. I will again take up the matter with mayor Balkar Sandhu and MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal,” he added.MC SDO Samarvir Singh said that he is not aware of any protest as he was in the field on Saturday. “There was some issue regarding a disposal point from where the sewer water is pumped out, and it has been resolved,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-residents-take-to-streets-over-clogged-sewer-lines-101628375048226.html
08-08-2021||Chandigarh||Councillor seeks razing of unsafe industrial building in Ludhiana||Lying in a dilapidated condition since a massive fire broke out in May last year, the multi-storey building of RT Woollen Mills in Industrial Area- A is posing grave danger to the lives of residents and workers in the neighbouring buildings.Fearing that the building might collapse during the rainy season after its boundary wall shifted by around two feet from its original place, the municipal corporation (MC) sealed it on Thursday.The move came a day after Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) councillor Swarandeep Chahal submitted a complaint with mayor Balkar Sandhu.Chahal, who owns the adjoining building, demanded that the MC should get the building razed to avoid any untoward incident, as apart from the labourers working in the nearby factories/commercial establishments, over 200 of them live in the quarters situated in the area around the damaged building.Chahal said,” I came to know about the condition of the building after its boundary wall (rear side) shifted from its original place and led to the collapse of our plot’s boundary wall on July 29. The building situated on around 2,000 square yards is unsafe. Even though the pillars on its rear side are broken and the concrete slab of the first floor is supported by wooden piles, its owner was trying to resume operations there claiming that the building is safe.”“If it collapses, it might result in a large number of casualties. The owner is putting the lives of residents at stake. Even the MC officials were not paying heed to the problem until I went to the mayor on Wednesday. I have been complaining about the building since July 29. Even now, the MC has just sealed the building instead of forcing the owner to demolish it,” said Chahal.Kulwant Singh, the owner of Manjit Timber situated behind the damaged building, said, “The boundary wall of the fire-ravaged building is also expanding towards our side due to which the plaster of our boundary wall also got damaged.”“I will submit a complaint regarding the same with the mayor,” said Singh. Meanwhile, the MC officials stated that a few employees were present inside the unsafe building, which has now been vacated and sealed. MC assistant town planner (ATP) Mohan Singh said that the MC had earlier declared the building unsafe, and a report has now been sent to higher authorities for further action.Mayor Balkar Sandhu said,” It is now the responsibility of the owner to raze the building or else he can submit a fee with MC for demolishing the same. The MC is looking into the legal aspects and the owner will be responsible for any accident that takes place.” A fire broke out at the woollen unit on May 24 last year. The fire-fighting operation continued for over 12 hours. In total, 14 fire tenders were deployed at the spot, which was refilled over 100 times to douse the flames. No casualty was reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/councillor-seeks-razing-of-unsafe-industrial-building-in-ludhiana-101628374988014.html
08-08-2021||Chandigarh||Kotkapura firing case: Deficient probe by SIT chief delayed action, says Tewari||With his party facing flak over delayed action in the Kotkapura firing case, Congress MP Manish Tewari has alleged that justice in the case had been delayed due to the deficient investigation conducted by the then SIT chief and now Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Kunwar Vijay Pratap, whose report was also quashed by the Punjab and Haryana high court in April.Addressing a press conference at the Circuit House on Saturday, Tewari said the state government had to face embarrassment due to the deficient inquiry and conduct of Pratap, and thereafter he had joined the AAP. He said the new SIT will soon submit the chargesheet and justice will be served in the case.On the tussle between chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, Tewari, who is also senior spokesperson of the Congress, said in his 40 years of experience, he had learned that no party can form a government if the CM and the state party chief did not work together. So, they both will work together to form the government in 2022.Lambasting the Union government over the Pegasus spyware row and the three farm laws, he said the sheer arrogance of the BJP government was responsible for the prolonged parliamentary logjam that could wash out the entire monsoon session. He also flayed the Union government for renaming the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award after legendary hockey player Major Dhyan Chand: “If the government wanted to honour the hockey wizard, it should have announced a new award in his name.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kotkapura-firing-case-deficient-probe-by-sit-chief-delayed-action-says-tewari-101628374807950.html

His body was buried deep in the debris, and it took rescue teams over three hours to recover his body.The fire department said six fire tenders reached Nand Nagri’s Block E soon after the Delhi Police informed them about the collapse around 1.30pm on Saturday.Three people — Dhani Ram (65), Anaro Devi (65) and Raj Kumar (64) — were rescued from the wreckage and taken to the nearby Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, where they are being treated for their injuries.

The morning rains could have led to the collapse,” said an investigating officer, asking not to be named.“The house is owned by Dhani Ram who lived with his family members there. It was a two-storey building with shops on the ground floor. At the time of the collapse, he was inside with the other victims who are his relatives.

To bolster the industrial sector and create jobs, she said the upcoming hi-tech cycle valley at Dhanansu village should be made fully operational by February next. The valley has already attracted prominent industry players such as Hero Cycles, Aditya Birla Group and JK Paper Limited. Hero Cycles Limited has already set up their anchor unit with a production capacity of 4 million bicycles per annum, especially e-bikes and premium bikes. Similarly, Aditya Birla Group has proposed to invest around ₹1,000 crore in the hi-tech valley. However, she evaded questions on the exit of Adani Group-led Adani logistic plant, which had rendered over 500 employees jobless. “It was a local issue and all are aware of it,” she said.Mahajan said the land acquisition process for the construction of new national highways – Delhi-Katra expressway, four-laning of Talwandi Bhai to Ferozepur, Ludhiana-Talwandi NH-95, Kharar-Ludhiana and Ladhowal Bypass – at a total cost of ₹5,700 crore should be completed by October 15. ‘Covid‘Testing ramped up among students’Leaving nothing to chance, especially with schools resuming physical classes, the health department is collecting nearly 10,000 samples from school children daily to monitor the spread of the infection, shared Mahajan She said the state government had also urged the central government to increase the supply of vaccines under the government quota. Besides, for early identification of new Covid variants, a new genome sequencing laboratory will soon be set up at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) in Patiala.

08-08-2021||Lucknow||Don’t elect people with a ‘narrow mindset’ to power: Nadda in UP||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president JP Nadda, who is on a two-day visit to poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, launched a fresh attack on the Opposition on Saturday, saying people with “narrow mindset” should not be elected to power.“On April 20, 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modiji constituted a task force and he gave the country two vaccines (against coronavirus) in nine months... It is a separate matter (that the Opposition said) we will not get vaccinated. This is a vaccine of the BJP. Now, you have been vaccinated with the BJP vaccine. This tells the mindset of the leaders. Those who have a narrow mindset, how will they lead UP? This is something to think upon,” said Nadda, as he urged the people to “bless the BJP again” in the 2022 assembly elections.Nadda’s visit comes at a time Uttar Pradesh is gearing up for the next year’s assembly polls, in which the ruling BJP will be pitted against the Samajwadi Party, the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Congress and other regional fronts.Addressing a meeting of the newly-elected chairpersons of zila panchayats and block panchayats, the BJP chief directed the officials to launch a mega awareness campaign about the initiatives and achievements of the Narendra Modi government at the Centre and the Adityanath government in the state. “Visit your vicinity and check if anyone has not taken vaccines, if there is any house that doesn’t have a toilet, or free gas connection? It’s our duty to ensure that these benefits reach one and all, without any discrimination,” he said.Attacking the Opposition, Nadda claimed that while the BJP cadres were helping the poor and the needy at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, Opposition leaders were busy criticising the government and questioning the indigenous vaccines.“They are working to mislead (people). They have damaged the country by saying ‘do you think that we are guinea pig’. Today, when I meet them, and ask whether they have taken the vaccine, they say ‘yes’,” said Nadda.Hitting back at Nadda, Akhilesh Yadav said: “People are distressed with BJP. Samajwadi Party will win the elections by bagging the number of seats I had predicted and form the next government”.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/dont-elect-people-with-a-narrow-mindset-to-power-nadda-in-up-101628371475153.html
08-08-2021||Lucknow||Nadda says Yogi govt has taken everyone along, people will bless BJP again in UP assembly polls||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda on Saturday said the people would bless the party again in the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly polls and criticised those who questioned the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination campaign.Nadda, who arrived on a two-day visit to the state, also said, “There was a time when it was said that this community was ruling UP or that community was running UP. It appeared as if there was no rule of the society. Now, under the leadership of PM Modi, chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s government in UP has been able to take everyone along.” He tasked the newly elected district panchayat and kshetra panchayat chairpersons in the state with launching a mega awareness campaign about the initiatives and achievements of the Narendra Modi government at the Centre and the Yogi Adityanath government in the state. The 2022 UP assembly elections are due in about seven months’ time. He asked 67 of the 75 district panchayat chairpersons and 648 of the 826 kshetra panchayat chairpersons, who won on the BJP’s backing, to set the party’s agenda in rural UP. BJP national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh, who has been regularly visiting UP since June to fine-tune the party’s preparedness, gave Nadda company from Delhi.Nadda addressed the elected representatives at Lucknow’s Indira Gandhi Pratishthan about the same time as Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav held a press conference to criticise the BJP government over what he alleged was its “failure on all fronts”.Nadda, too, targeted Yadav in a veiled fashion. He raised the “BJP ki vaccine (BJP’s vaccine)” comment to target Yadav. “In UP, record vaccination has been done. Now, some said that it was BJP ki vaccine. Our scientists had worked hard to develop the vaccine as a safeguard against Covid and here such comments were made which depict the kind of mindset people have. How can such opposition (think of) running UP?” Nadda said.On January 2, Akhilesh Yadav had said he would not take the Covid vaccine jab as he did not trust the BJP’s vaccine. He later clarified that he had faith in scientists.At an event on Friday, Yadav said he had not taken the vaccine yet and would take it only after the needy received it.Nadda told the rural representatives to visit each household and check if the benefits of the government schemes were reaching them. “Visit your vicinity and check if anyone has not taken vaccine, if there is any house that doesn’t have a toilet, or free gas connection? It’s our duty to ensure that these benefits reach one and all, without any discrimination,” he said.Nadda claimed that while the BJP cadres were helping the poor and the needy during the height of the Covid surge, the Opposition leaders had “quarantined” themselves and had limited themselves to criticising the government through virtual press conferences.Nadda also held a meeting with the in-charges of all the 403 assembly constituencies. Later, he, along with chief minister Yogi Adityanath and other top BJP leaders, met ministers and party functionaries for feedback about various initiatives and poll preparedness.He is scheduled to visit Agra on Sunday before flying back to Delhi.Ensure better coordination: Yogi to panchayat chiefsUttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday asked the newly elected gram pradhans (village heads), district panchayat and kshetra panchayat chairpersons to ensure better coordination so that development activities could be undertaken in rural areas of the state.“You are going to be the main agents driving change and development in rural areas. Remember while our government has done record vaccination and undertaken a successful test-trace and treat campaign, the threat of Covid-19 is still not over. “We will have to be cautious and focus on sanitisation,” he said.UP BJP chief tasks panchayat reps with working for party’s win in assembly pollsUttar Pradesh BJP president Swatantra Dev asked the newly elected representatives in the rural areas to ensure party’s win in the 2022 UP assembly polls.“Abrogation of Article 370, the bhoomi pujan for Ram temple in Ayodhya, the fight against Covid-19 have been among several landmark initiatives of the BJP. It’s clear that only the BJP has the policy, leadership and the vision to fuel the development of the country and the state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/nadda-says-yogi-govt-has-taken-everyone-along-people-will-bless-bjp-again-in-up-assembly-polls-101628366827674.html
08-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra will take calculated risk on relaxations: Uddhav||Maharashtra recorded 6,061 fresh Covid-19 infections on Saturday, pushing the count to 6,347,820, even as the government mulls further relaxations within a few days. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday said a decision on further relaxations, including reopening local train services for all citizens, will be made in the next few days. Thackeray said that the government will take a “calculated risk”, so that a possible third wave does not hit the state hard, like it did in the previous wave. The tally of active cases reduced to 71,050 as 9,356 recoveries were reported in the past 24 hours. The state recorded 128 new casualties with Pune district reporting the highest (17) deaths, followed by Satara with 15 fatalities. The state government is planning to further ease lockdown restrictions in 25 districts where the growth rate as well as positivity rate is much less than the average. Speaking at an event in Mumbai, Thackeray said he is consulting health experts, health department officials and civic officials over putting further relaxations. The state government is considering opening up local train services for fully vaccinated people. “We are in the process of making a decision regarding restaurant/eateries and local [trains]. I am speaking to experts, health officials in the state and in BMC. In the next two to five days, the government will announce what further relaxations will be provided,” Thackeray said. Thackeray, who is under pressure from all quarters to provide additional operational hours for restaurants and eateries, allow fully vaccinated people to use trains, said that the government has to move ahead “cautiously” to ensure that the Covid-19 situation that has bettered in Mumbai does not reverse like it did in the second wave. The chief minister said, “We have to move ahead cautiously so that while the take steps [towards unlocking] we don’t make any wrong moves. We have to take calculated risk. Covid situation is now better in Mumbai but we have to ensure that it does not reverse. The first wave had receded and the second wave hit us so fast. The chaos it led to is something I don’t even want to recall. Therefore, in the next few days, we will take more decisions [towards giving relaxations].” Thackeray said that gradually things are getting back to normal again across the state as the state is easing restrictions in the state in phases. “Yesterday, representatives from hotel and restaurants associations met me. There is a demand from all to start the local trains. We have not locked up everything and misplaced the key. We have the key, and gradually we are turning it and reopening looking at the Covid situation,” he said. State health minister Rajesh Tope also said they are working on crowd management at railway stations which will be required after allowing fully vaccinated people to travel through local services. “No one is opposed to allowing those fully vaccinated in local trains, but discussion is going on over its proper implementation. Checking certificates and allowing them to enter in the railway stations will require a separate system as we all know the number of people traveling in local trains in Mumbai is huge and the chief minister is working on the same,” Tope said. On August 2, the state government provided relaxations from the lockdown restrictions to 25 districts where growth rate and positivity rate is less than the state’s average. It has allowed all essential and non-essential shops to stay open till 10pm, while restaurants are allowed to operate at 50% seating capacity till 4pm. As the state government is likely to ease down curbs, the state is looking at a slight drop in the graph of Covid-19 cases. The daily cases are between 6,000 and 7,000 for the few days. In the last seven days, it has recorded 41,774 cases which is much less compared to the first week of the last month when 61,489 cases were reported. On the other hand, there are also many districts and cities that have not reported a single case on Saturday. Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Malegaon, Parbhani, Akola and Nagpur cities reported zero cases whereas districts such as Dhule, Hingoli, Yavatmal Wardha, Bhandara and Gondia also found no cases. On Saturday, Mumbai clocked 332 cases and reported a total 737,192 cases till date. It also recorded five fatalities, taking the toll to 15,942. In the last 24 hours, the state tested 199,681 samples and had a positivity rate of 3.03%. However, the overall positivity rate of the state stood at 12.86%, according to the data issued by the state health department. It has also vaccinated 304,009 people on Saturday, according to the data available on Co-Win portal. It has administered 46,682,776 doses in the state till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-will-take-calculated-risk-on-relaxations-uddhav-101628366766863.html

Since the scam came to the fore, the department’s teams have been checking all four godowns in the sub-division since Friday. If calculated at the minimum support price (MSP), the value of the siphoned of grain comes out at more than ₹16 crore. The volume of the missing wheat may grow further as checking is still underway, said department officials. In the police complaint, food and supply inspector Raj Rishi Mehra said, “Assistant food and supply officer (Jandiala Guru) Arshdeep Singh brought it to my notice on August 3 that they were not able to establish contact with Jasdev Singh since July 31 and he was also keeping his mobile phone switched off. Neither he nor any of his family members were found at his house. Arshdeep expressed an apprehension that Jasdev Singh may have been involved in certain misdeed.” “As per records, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) was to get a “special load” of wheat at the Gehri railway station in the district. It is mandatory for the custodian inspector to be present in the godown at the time of a “special load”. But Jasdev Singh was not duty that day,” Mehra said. “So it was decided to get the godowns under the supervision of Jasdev Singh check so as to ascertain the actual status of the stock. During the checking, a total of 1,93,343 bags of wheat were found missing from the godowns in the sub-division,” he added. The Pungrain, an undertaking of the department of food and civil supplies, looks after the purchase, storage and dispatch of the grain in the state. A case was registered against the custodian inspector and unidentified persons under sections 409 (criminal breach of trust by a public servant, banker, merchant or an agent), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), and 120 (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code at the Jandiala police station, said investigating officer Durlabhdarshan Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/87100-quintal-wheat-missing-from-pungrain-godowns-in-jandiala-guru-101628366226552.html
08-08-2021||Other||Wildbuzz | Owls! Phantoms of eerie hours||As a child budding in a verdant Sector-7 bungalow in Chandigarh, I would awake to a haunting bird call in the eerie hours when the human spirit is at its lowest ebb. The call went as a single, mellow, interrogative note, ‘wuat?’, jerked out unhurriedly and monotonously every three seconds or so. The call’s acoustics startled the bungalow’s brooding atmosphere. I was versed enough with Nature’s ways to discern it was an owl’s vocalisation.I searched for the owl in the trees the next day and my eyes picked a silent spotted owlet in just the second one I scanned, a fig tree. I presumed it was the phantom of the opera well past last midnight. As luck would have it, the legendary birdman of India, Dr Salim Ali, was on a tour during summer 1982 and was staying with us. I went up to him and grandly announced I had heard an owl call, ‘wuat?’, had searched for “many exhausting hours” the next day in “every single tree” and pinpointed the spooky songster as the Spotted Owlet. Dr Ali was very patient and encouraging with children. Ever so gently he pricked my ballooning birding ego. He identified the species from my description of the call as the Punjab Collared Scops Owl, which is currently known as the Indian Scops Owl (ISO). In Dr Ali’s words, the Spotted Owlet’s calls were very different: “A harsh, screechy ‘chirrur-chirurr-chirurr’ etc followed by or alternated with ‘cheewak, cheewak, cheewak’ and a variety of equally discordant screeches and chuckles.” As a child, I had heard the ‘chirrur’ calls umpteen times but since they were not spooky enough for a young mind mired in detective fiction and ghost thrillers, I had not stretched a limb to pinpoint the caller.He went on to explain that there was every chance of both species perched close by but a keen and uninitiated eye noticing only the more conspicuous of the two, the head-bobbing Spotted Owlet. The ISO was a master in camouflage, remained frozen as a statue during the day and could hide in some obscure, dark nook of the foliage by taking the shape of a tree snag such as a decaying leaf. Dr Ali prodded me to redouble my efforts and locate the perch of the ISO, the true ‘wuat?’ caller. Following his gentle rebuke, I was desperate to deliver an atonement to the globally-renowned birdman and then PM Indira Gandhi’s favourite conservationist. Much to my consternation, I was never able to find the wily ‘wuat?’ phantom. Despite the many honest hours I invested in neck craning and feverishly scanning leafy boughs as if they held out the promise of a furtive glimpse of misting limbs and appendages of a perching Bo Derek or Zeenat Aman.I recalled the anecdote with a wry grin just a few days back on August 4, celebrated as International Owl Awareness Day. Nocturnal species such as owls and nightjars prove arduous to spot during the day due to their cryptic habits, plumages and enigmatic silences. At night, one may trod upon an irate serpent if one chooses to randomly poke the eye up the dark chambers of foliage looking for an owl. The saving grace is that owl lingo is more distinctive than the faces that subtly set them apart. The owl species is identified by keeping the ears peeled from dusk to dawn while knowing precisely which owl makes which particular call. The night listening enables us to assess the owl’s rough location and makes it easier to locate the perch the next day. In other words, an owl’s call is virtually its nightly face.So, know your owls, if not by the scowls of the day then by their drawls in the dark. You will find they are wondrous creatures whose real lives are not at all governed by the presumptions of superstition.

On Saturday evening, a few kilometers away from Bindra’s house, fans and media persons swarmed the Tau Devi Lal Stadium in Panchkula to watch Neeraj Chopra claim India’s second individual gold medal, this time in javelin throw at the Tokyo Olympics. Neeraj, a native of Khandra village in Haryana’s Panipat district, had come to this Panchkula stadium a decade ago to learn the nuances of javelin throw from his first coach Naseem Ahmad. Ecstatic scenes were witnessed at the stadium where the men’s javelin throw event was being live streamed on a big screen, and coach Naseem was hooked to it along with around 1,000 fans. As soon as Neeraj’s claim to the gold medal was confirmed, an emotional Naseem said: “My boy did India proud, finally winning the first medal for track and field events for India in the Olympics. I knew Neeraj would do it. He was confident ahead of the final.” Naseem, who had trained Neeraj from 2011 to 2015 before he got into the Indian camp and also joined the Indian Army, said: “I remember him as a sharp kid. Coming from rural Haryana, he had the hunger to do well and become a top-notch athlete. Three-four young javelin throwers had come from Panipat with him to excel in the sport as there was no javelin equipment in Panipat academies. He had previously won two to three tournaments at the district and state level.” The 58-year-old coach, who is posted at the stadium that is run by the Haryana sports department, also praised Neeraj for dedicating his gold medal to the legendary sprinter Milkha Singh, who died recently, and other Indian athletes like PT Usha.Neeraj has another connect with Chandigarh. In 2015, he had enrolled at DAV College, Sector 10, an institution that has produced Kapil Dev and Yuvraj Singh (cricket), Anjum Moudgil (shooting), Sukhbir Singh Gill (hockey) and Gurpreet Singh Sandhu (football) among other Indian sportspersonsNeeraj had taken admission in BA and in just one year broke the meet record in the all-India inter-varsity competition.“It was so inspiring to have Neeraj at our college. Other athletes learned so much from him. I spoke to him the day before the final and told him to not be nervous and just be fearless. And he was focused and not at all nervous,” said Ravinder Choudhary, associate professor, physical education department, DAV College, and also secretary of the Athletics Federation of India. College students and the staff celebrated Neeraj’s feat, with Anjum Moudgil joining them too.Neeraj made his international debut in 2016, when he won the World U20 Championship in Poland, with a world junior record throw of 86.48 metres. He won gold in the 2016 South Asian Games with a throw of 82.23 metres. At Tokyo, his 87.58-metre throw got India the gold. “This gold will change the Indian athletics for good,” said Naseem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/olympic-gold-medalist-neeraj-chopra-has-chandigarh-connect-101628365146284.html
08-08-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column | The joy of putting pen to paper||I am not a writer by the yardstick of professionals, author or even a regular columnist. However, I write everyday, even if it is a letter to the editor. The act of expressing my views freely infuses me with happiness. It does not matter if the piece is rejected as it has been written from the heart to voice one’s convictions. Of course, if a letter or article is chosen for publication, it lifts one’s spirits, as it helps one to connect to more people. Whenever I get a rejection slip (I have dozens), I smile, and delete it so that the e-mail does not stare at my face.My journey started in 1965 with my contribution to our school magazine ‘Shu -Zen’ at King George’s School, Belgaum, when I was in the seventh standard. My first piece was published in a children’s magazine ‘ Sun Shine’ in 1966. Thereafter, the pursuit of reading, writing, and speaking continued hand-in hand, thanks to our principal RS Mani, who passed on good books, and encouraged me to speak in morning assemblies. My father, an avid reader of Urdu journals, also encouraged me.In college too, I continued writing for newspapers and magazines. I would painstakingly prepare a speech for an inter-college debate and declamation contest and deliver it with passion. One had to work very hard, as one rubbed shoulders with Sushma Sharma (former minister of external affairs Sushma Swaraj) from the PU law department, Vivek Katju (who went on to become the foreign secretary) from the St Stephen’s college, Vikram Vohra (breakfast show host), Ish Kapoor, ML Verma, Jyotsana Pandit, Harvinder Kaur and many other top PU debaters. After the event was over, I would convert my speech into an article and send it to a newspaper or magazine. Many times, the article was not published, but some editors were encouraging and publishing some of these in the form of letters or comments on a current topic. This was thrilling in itself as friends and teachers complimented me. DAV College, Chandigarh, principal Triloki Nath would call me and say ‘ shabash’ whenever he read my contributions. I donned the uniform as a commissioned officer in 1974. While I picked up the gun , I did not drop the pen. It now flowed for service journals and magazines. After hanging my uniform in 2012, I started writing as a hobby. Apart from delivering lectures on communication skills to the youth, and conducting INTACH activities, writing keeps me busy and satisfied. It does not allow time to weigh heavy on me as a senior citizen, and one feels relaxed after expressing oneself. It is like a daily diet for the mind and spirit. I do not write to provoke or vent negative energy. Writing has healing properties for me. It allows me to say what I feel strongly about, rather than cribbing or sulking. The aim is to be constructive, and chip in one’s bit towards a better society. I mingle with people from villages, daily wagers, and safai karamcharis to understand their frustrations and write meaningfully. I must feel the pain to be worthy of some healing.Writing proved to be a boon during the lockdown period. It kept me occupied at home, and my mind stimulated. The urge to write cannot be locked. It will flow, and no power can stop it. Social media has given another opening to writers, and they can now share their views with a wider audience.Recently, my wife decided to organise my written work, and put my published pieces, year wise, in separate files. Lo and behold! She counted over 1,100 letters to the editor and comments, and over 125 articles published in different newspapers, magazines, and service journals. The treasure is a result of this creative hobby and our whole family has inculcated the habit of reading and writing. What a joy!ripu_d2003@yahoo.co.in(The writer is an Ambala-based freelance contributor)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-the-joy-of-putting-pen-to-paper-101628365026305.html
08-08-2021||Chandigarh||Covid: Hospital owners held for negligence in Punjab’s Zirakpur||Owners of a private hospital in Zirakpur have been arrested for alleged overcharging and negligence that led to the death of a Covid-19 patient. They have been identified as Dr Manish Goyal, owner and director, and Pravir Goyal, owner and managing director, of New Life Line Hospital. “The complaints were lodged by the wife of deceased. After inquiry, the hospital was indicted for violation of Covid-19 guidelines, overcharging and negligence,” said Omkar Singh Brar, station house officer, Zirakpur. The two were produced in court and sent to one-day police custody. In May 2020, Paramjit Singh, a resident of Noida, died while undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at New Life Line Hospital. His family had accused the hospital management and staff of negligence and overcharging. In two separate complaints, lodged by Singh’s wife, it was alleged that patients inside the hospital were treated without PPE kit and were not given timely meals. The complainant also alleged that the hospital had not provided bills and medicine receipts and had overcharged for the treatment. A three-member committee was constituted that indicted the hospital. Initially, only Dr Manish was booked but later his brother Pravir was also named. Initially, a case was registered under the Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Disease Act, but after the committee report, Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code were added too, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-hospital-owners-held-for-negligence-in-punjab-s-zirakpur-101628364846642.html
08-08-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column | When legendary sprinter Mann Kaur caught the tech bug||While working at a local college, I had the opportunity of interacting with several senior citizens seeking to admit their grandchildren in different courses. I soon realised that most of them were not tech savvy.Catching some of them gazing at the computer labs hesitantly, in awe of the contraptions within, got me thinking and I pitched the idea of imparting free-of-cost computer training to senior citizens in the tricity area to the management as part of its social responsibility initiative.The college labs were equipped with around 150 computers and the machines as well as trainers were made available to senior citizens after 3pm. The course was advertised in newspapers, and my steno received around 200 calls on the very first day. The callers included a former chief secretary and his wife, a retired director general of police, doctors, engineers and retired officers from the armed forces.A syllabus was designed, and basic study material was prepared. The first batch had 40 pupils, all of whom were over 65 years of age. The course was inaugurated by justice SS Sodhi (retd) in November 2004.One of the participants was Mann Kaur, the legendary sprinter who went on to break several centenarian track-and-field records. She was 87 at the time.An unmatched zeal to learnAfter a break-in session on the opening day, all of us moved from the mini auditorium to the IT department. I couldn’t help noticing a short grey-haired lady leading us all. After reaching the lab, she stood in the first row in front of the computer where I had planned to explain the basics. The zeal of the eager pupil in the 45-minute class was something to be seen. She refused to leave the machine after the allotted time was over and insisted on more time. In the computer lab, the octogenarian, was like an eager teenager trying hard to impress her teacher. On the final day, we had a tea party and a feedback session. Kaur immediately took charge and regaled everybody with humorous anecdotes. Later, whenever I read about her achievements in athletics, I attributed it to her undying spirit for learning, trying and experimenting. She redefined the word “passion” for me. It is true that those blessed with wings, never stick to their nests. It is never too late to follow a passionIt is a well-known fact that most great achievers scaled new heights and reached the pinnacle of success after crossing the half-time of life. These achievers believed that there is no such thing as “too late” in life. What is common between Bertrand Russell, George Bernard Shaw, Michelangelo, Somerset Maugham, Winston Churchill and Peter Drucker? Two things: they lived a long life and were sharp, witty and creative. They left the world richer through their contribution. For instance, even at the age of 99, author Khushwant Singh was mentally sprier than most and his contributions were acknowledged and recognised by his worst critics.Such people do not let their biological age as defined by the dates on a calendar define them. Real age is determined by perception and attitude. One may not be able to stop the wrinkles and creases from deepening but advancing in age does not have to mean having a weak mind in a weak body. In fact, engaging in productive activities helps one live longer.People like Mann Kaur do not let opportunities go by because they are too old to avail them. They take to their passion like duck to water. They understand that the mind and spirit never age. The cells which decay due to advancing age are replaced by newer and younger neurons. Old age, in fact, is the dawn of intellect and creative powers and one has so much to give to the younger generation. May the clan of Mann Kaurs continue to inspire us!colcheema1942@gmail.com(The writer is a Panchkula-based freelance contributor)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-when-legendary-sprinter-mann-kaur-caught-the-tech-bug-101628364666265.html
08-08-2021||Chandigarh||Tricity buzz: Congress high command wary of Mail Mantri||Many in the Chandigarh Congress had nicknamed former city unit chief Pardeep Chhabra “Mail Mantri”. “Whenever we talked to our senior leaders in Delhi or went to the party headquarters, we were told to stop our Mail Mantri from sending a trail of emails. Chhabra had been relentlessly writing emails to Delhi, airing his grievances against local party leaders,” said a local Congress leader. Incidentally, in his resignation letter to the party, Chhabra cited how the high command had not responded to his multiple emails as one of the reasons for calling it quits. Breather from infighting in city Congress for now Last week saw the Congress fighting infighting in Chandigarh. With the former city unit chief, Pardeep Chhabra, quitting the party, many insiders were relieved. “Now the party will not get bad publicity,” said a party leader, requesting anonymity. But he was quick to add: “Things should be peaceful at least till the party starts distributing tickets for the municipal corporation elections. Then we may see another round of ruckus.” A glass half full: Chandigarh MC’s novel way to save water The Cutting Paani campaign seems to have found favour with the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation, particularly after it came to light that the MC loses at least 30% of drinking water to leakages in supply. The MC’s water and sanitation committee came up with a novel way to save water the other day. It asked MC officials to ensure that councillors at the monthly general house meeting are served a glass half full each. This, it hopes, will help tide over its water woes. Well, each drop counts. Mohali mayor takes jibe at Azad group councillor During the monthly house meeting in Mohali on August 3, city mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu took a jibe at a councillor of the Azad group, Sukhdev Singh Patwari. Patwari said work was still to start in some development projects approved in his ward in 2020. The mayor, who is from the Congress, hit back, saying: “During your tenure, no development works were started. But don’t worry, we will soon start work.” Patwari, who was with the Shiromani Akali Dal, joined the Azad group, led by former mayor Kulwant Singh, after the civic elections in February. When UT education dept was caught off guard While there was talk about reopening school for students of Classes 7 and 8 on the lines of senior classes, when the date for this was fixed on August 9, it came as news to many. While UT adviser Dharam Pal issued an order in this regard on Wednesday, personnel in the education department claimed not to know about it. However, the department was involved in making arrangements on how the classes would function and a detailed order regarding this was issued by the UT education department on Friday. Campaigning for senate poll in full swing now After the Panjab University senate elections finally started on August 3, campaigning is on in full swing. When the poll schedule was announced last month, a number of candidates and voters were apprehensive whether polling will take place or not. This was the third time since last year that PU announced the poll schedule. Not much enthusiasm was seen among candidates when the schedule was announced in July but now, they are campaigning in the campus even during weekends.

08-08-2021||Chandigarh||Our Take: Should Chandigarh have an exclusive administrator?||With VP Singh Badnore set to complete his five-year tenure on the gubernatorial post later this month, speculation is rife that the Centre could divest the next Punjab governor of the charge of UT administrator and appoint a separate executive head for Chandigarh. Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal has spoken against any such purported move, bringing the spotlight back on whether the existing system should continue or Chandigarh should revert to the chief commissioner system. Until 1984, the UT was helmed by a chief commissioner at the top of the bureaucratic hierarchy in the joint capital of Punjab and Haryana. But, turmoil of the 1980s in the border state led to a new system in which Punjab governor was also designated as the administrator of Chandigarh.The dual charge, introduced at the beginning of a five-year-long President’s rule in Punjab, was necessitated by law and order exigencies of coordination between Punjab, Chandigarh and the Union government. However, what was a stop-gap system of governance has continued even two decades after peace returned to Punjab. Over the time, Chandigarh has evolved as a vibrant city with high-level of civic aspirations. Classified as a smart city, the UT has however been suffering from governance deficit that is attributed, in major part, to the duality of Punjab Raj Bhawan also steering the UT’s complex and challenging issues. The extra powers to Punjab governor in affairs of a shared capital has also led to heartburn for Haryana.There has been growing feeling, both in the bureaucracy and political class of Chandigarh, that the city would be better off with an exclusive administrator at the top to deal with complex and challenging issues that the UT faces. That, in effect, means return to the chief commissioner system which, many believe, was much more effective with direct powers in the affairs of administration.The redesignation of the adviser as chief commissioner and more power to elected municipal corporation may pave the way for a hands-on governance that Chandigarh direly needs to realise its potential as a world-class city and live up to its residents’ high expectations.What is your opinion? Should Chandigarh revert to the chief commissioner system or is the existing system working fine?

08-08-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column | Chandigarh Housing Board at odds with its objectives||On July 15, the Chandigarh Housing Board invited the public to submit suggestions on how it could simplify its processes and minimise regulatory compliances, which was surprising in itself as many of my representations are buried beneath the files at the CHB office. The CHB was established in 1976 with the primary objective of providing affordable and quality housing to UT residents, particularly the less affluent sections of society. However, all of it is water under the bridge, with the housing board charging a small fortune for its flats.This is evidenced by the board’s 2016 self-finance scheme for Sector 51, which garnered a poor response due to the unrealistically high price of the flats. A mere 225 applications were received for 200 units. However, the CHB remained undeterred and pitched a costlier housing scheme for Sector 53, where a three BHK (bedrooms, hall and kitchen) flat was offered for ₹1.8 crore, a two BHK for ₹1.47 crore and one BHK for ₹95 lakh. To nobody’s surprise the CHB found few takers and the prices had to be revised twice. The final pricing for the three categories was ₹1.5 crore, ₹1.28 crore and ₹86 lakh, respectively, which was still way over the market price. The scheme drew so poor a response that it had to be scrapped.This raises questions over how the CHB determines the price for its flats and shows that the board has deflected from its professed objectives over the years.Hefty fee for recording transfersMoreover, the CHB recovers the complete cost of its housing projects from the allottees. Once possession is handed over to an allottee, the CHB owes no duty to the allottees. The cost of all repairs, and maintenance work falls to the allottee.The board also charges a pretty penny for recording the transfer of flats and houses. For instance, in Sector 63, the flats were initially allotted on leasehold basis. If an allottee sold his high-income group (HIG) flat after the lock-in period by way of a registered sale deed and the purchaser applied to CHB to transfer the flat in his name, then the purchaser had to pay a transfer fee of ₹3,75,000, with an additional 18% goods and service tax (GST). The same fee is charged each time the flat is sold, generating a handsome income for the CHB. Interestingly, the CHB earlier charged a mind-boggling sum ranging from ₹7 lakh to ₹10 lakh, depending on the category of flat. Is charging so high a fee for merely recording transfers in CHB records commensurate with the ‘affordable’ housing objective of the CHB in any manner?At each step one has to pay arbitrary charges and a hefty fee for the most nominal of services. For example, it is mandatory to pay ₹10,000, plus GST, for publishing a notice for each sale in newspapers. Every sale and transfer of property is published in newspapers for no rhyme or reason on the dime of the purchaser. This also applies to legal heirs who have to pay around ₹12,000 for the same despite there being no ambiguity in the chain of title.Legally, publishing neither creates rights in favour of the transferee nor does it extinguish anybody’s interest in the property. Thus, publishing every transfer in the newspaper is a futile exercise. The common man has to shell out money to satisfy the whims of the babus at the helm.Arbitrary, exorbitant pricing In case, a purchaser takes a home loan, the bank sends a letter to CHB intimating it of its charge over the property. The CHB only has to put that letter in the concerned property file for record purposes. However, it charges ₹7,500, plus GST, for the same. These are just a few ways by which the CHB unreasonably and arbitrarily charges allottees. Charging property owners for the meanest of services when the CHB does not take any responsibility for maintenance of flats after handing them over to the allottees is hardly fair.It is unfortunate that 45 years after its inception, the board has mutated into, yet another public sector behemoth bent on milking its allottees for all they are worth.amitjaiswal.adv@gmail.com(The writer is an advocate in the Punjab and Haryana high court.

08-08-2021||Chandigarh||Private schools in Chandigarh unlikely to reopen for Classes 7-8 yet||Even as the Chandigarh administration has allowed schools to resume physical classes for students of Classes 7 and 8 Monday onwards, it is unlikely that private institutions will reopen for the two classes just yet. The schools are mulling talking to the parents and arrive at a consensus before reopening. On July 19, schools were allowed to reopen for Class 9 onwards, but not many did so immediately. Most schools reopened towards the end of July and even now, some private schools are conducting just online classes.President of the Independent Schools Association (ISA), HS Mamik, said, “We will consult the parents and would plan on reopening if we get at least 50% positive response. We have also asked parents regarding any inhibitions they have so that we can discuss and resolve them with the authorities.” Mamik, who is also the chairperson of Vivek High School in Sector 38, said their school reopened in August after an extended summer vacation and they recorded around 30% attendance. St Kabir Public School in Sector 26 was one of the only private schools in the city to reopen along with government schools when the restrictions were lifted. However, administrator Gurpreet Bakshi said they might not reopen from Monday. “We have sought the parents’ opinion. For Class 9 onwards, around 40% parents had said yes, but the attendance is still around 30%,” Bakshi said, adding that they are using hybrid classrooms to conduct online and offline classes at the same time and will be adequately prepared to reopen for the younger classes as well. While St Stephen’s School in Sector 45 opened in the end of July owing to summer vacations, they are likely to delay the resumption of primary classes as well. “We will wait for the parents’ decision on this. However, it becomes taxing for our teachers to teach online and physical classes simultaneously,” he said, adding that around 30% of classes 9 and 10 students are coming to school as of now.Not all private schools have resumed the offline classes yet. One such school is St John’s High School in Sector 26, whose principal Kavita Das said, “Earlier, the children had exams and now we are waiting for them to clear their online backlog while we design a timetable and ensure the school is ready. We expect to reopen after the Independence Day.”Meanwhile, the education department on Friday issued a detailed order for the reopening of Classes 7 and 8. It is identical to the one issued for Classes 9 onwards. Schools will be open from 8:30am to 1pm for students and 8am to 2pm for staff. It has also called for ensuring vaccination of teaching and other staff.Around 15 children will be allowed per class and they’ll have to follow all Covid-safety protocols. Signed permit slips will be needed to enter the schools while online classes will continue side-by-side and attendance won’t be mandatory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/private-schools-in-chandigarh-unlikely-to-reopen-for-classes-7-8-yet-101628363466186.html
08-08-2021||Chandigarh||Nishan Sahib removed by Taliban at Afghanistan gurdwara restored||The Nishan Sahib, which was removed by the Taliban from Gurdwara Thala Sahib in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktia province, was restored with its “proper dignity” on Friday night, said president of Indian World Forum Puneet Singh Chandhok. Chandhok said he talked with the local caretaker of the gurdwara, who informed him that several Talibs revisited the gurdwara on Friday evening and agreed to its “functioning as per customs”.They also directed the caretaker to restore the Nishan Sahib, a Sikh religious flag, immediately in their presence. On Friday, it was reported that armed men had forced the caretaker to remove the Nishan Sahib from its assigned place and tied it to a tree so that it could not be viewed as a distinct symbol from afar.“I have been personally informed a few minutes back by Rahman Chamkani, local caretaker at the gurdwara that Nishan Sahib has been restored with its proper dignity at the roof of historical gurdwara last night,” Chandhok said.“He further said that Taliban officials, including their forces, revisited the gurdwara yesterday evening and conveyed their assent for the functioning of the shrine as per its customs,” he added. The gurdwara, located in the Chamkani area of Paktia, was once visited by Guru Nanak.The restoration of the Nishan Sahib comes after India condemned its removal.“We condemn this act and reiterate India’s firm belief that Afghanistan’s future must be one where the interest of all sections of Afghan society including minorities and women are protected,” government sources said.Chandhok appreciated the efforts of the Indian government and the international community for ensuring that the rights of minorities are well protected. Sikhs not safe in Afghanistan: BJP Chandigarh: The Punjab BJP on Saturday said the recent incident of sacrilege by Taliban forces of removing the Nishan Shaib in Afghanistan gurdwara is not only unfortunate but a precursor that the minority community of Sikhs will be targeted more ones the American forces leave the country. In a statement, BJP national spokesman Iqbal Singh Lalpura said a granthi was abducted from the gurdwara a few days ago, which clearly reflect how unsafe was the Sikh community Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nishan-sahib-removed-by-taliban-at-afghanistan-gurdwara-restored-101628363288706.html

The agency alleged that Saini acquired the house in a fraudulent deal with fake documents and questionable financial transactions.“Contribution made by the petitioner in the discharge of his official duties does not give a licence or permit to the him to indulge in the alleged shady financial transactions/deals after his retirement as alleged in the FIR,” special judge Parminder Singh Grewal said to an argument that Saini has been in the forefront in terrorism days and served as the DGP. The court observed that Saini transferred ₹6.4 crore to the owner Jaspal between August 2018 and August 2020 and the amount has not been paid in accordance with the condition of the rent of ₹2.5 lakh per month as claimed in the rent agreement. The sale agreement of October 2019 was not written on a stamp paper and is unregistered. Besides, it has no witness to it, the court observed, adding that the rent agreement has been executed as a cover-up to their earlier financial transactions, which have been performed in a clandestine manner to give undue benefit to one another with respect to alleged shady deal. It also took note of submissions that the rent was in excess to ₹50,000 but according to norms, 10% TDS deduction to be made by Saini as per the income tax laws was not done. “Thus, the custodial interrogation of the petitioner is required in this case to ascertain the mode and manner of the commission of the alleged offence,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-court-rejects-ex-dgp-saini-s-bail-plea-in-corruption-case-101628363106059.html

Addressing a press conference in Srinagar, People’s Conference chairman Sajjad Lone said, “In a democracy, we will not endorse any action where shops are opened or closed forcefully.” Traders in Srinagar alleged that police broke locks of several shops in the city. On Wednesday, president of retailers’ association Farhan Kitab had alleged that traders have been getting calls from the police and district administration not to observe a shutdown on August 5. “The administration told us that the shops from Lal Chowk to Polo View are on ‘nazool’ land (government land) and the traders have not renewed the legal formalities and are hence liable for legal action. Four of our shops were sealed on Wednesday,” he said. Kitab said that police also held a meeting with them, asking them not to indulge in any “anti-national’’ activity on August 5. “We are a traders’ body and can’t force anybody to keep their business open,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/admn-threatening-traders-with-police-cases-for-aug-5-shutdown-mehbooba-101628362446818.html
08-08-2021||Lucknow||BJP to highlight schemes of Modi, Yogi govts in run-up to Uttar Pradesh assembly polls||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Uttar Pradesh has launched a massive campaign to highlight the initiatives of the party’s governments at the Centre and in the state. The campaign would be run both physically and virtually, party leaders said, adding innovative folk songs to popularise the schemes would also be played in the rural areas. The steps to market these initiatives include putting a booklet detailing various government schemes in waterproof bags provided by the Yogi Adityanath government to all beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PM-GKAY) and asking cadres to visit rural households to enlist beneficiaries.A booklet titled ‘Iradey nek, kaam anek (honest intentions, several achievements) prepared by chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s government too has been distributed to party lawmakers for ready access, “recall and repeat” among the masses.Besides, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to virtually launch phase 2 of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjawala Yojana from UP on August 10, officials indicated. Uttar Pradesh is due for assembly elections early next year. The first phase of the Ujjawala Yojana, too, was launched from UP (Ballia) in 2016, a little ahead of the 2017 state assembly polls. This time, the scheme could be virtually launched from Bundelkhand, people familiar with the matter indicated. During his interaction via video conference with five beneficiaries of PM-GKAY in UP on Thursday, PM had listed many of his schemes, a strategy that BJP chief JP Nadda has now directed the party’s state unit to adop ahead of the polls. “Of the nearly eight crore beneficiaries of the Ujjawala Yojana, 2.54 crore families benefitted in UP alone,” Nadda told party workers in Lucknow and asked them to popularise these schemes. The BJP leadership has been telling the cadres to highlight how UP has been the biggest beneficiary of the various initiatives of the centre and how UP has also launched a campaign to cover all eligible poor, still not enlisted in the various social security schemes. For instance, under Ayushman Bharat, Nadda said more than 50 crore people across the country had got annual ₹5 lakh medical insurance cover and 2.54 crore benefitted from it.“In UP, 1.83 crore people have benefitted so far,” Nadda told cadres. He also added: “Those left out of the scheme so far are now being covered under Mukhyamantri Jan Arogya Yojana of the Yogi Adityanath government.” The emphasis on a state scheme launched with the idea of covering those who were left out of Ayushman Bharat is part of the party plan. “We are going to talk about how UP is changing. The state is now number two on the ease of doing business. That in itself is a big achievement for a state that was part of BIMARU states not very long back. From vaccination, Covid testing, hospital beds, oxygen availability, we have made rapid progress. So, we will of course tell the people that while the world praised India, the opposition was happy criticising us,” a BJP leader said.“The statements of opposition leaders too would be shown to the people,” he added. “Talk of agriculture where we have raised the spending from ₹1.21 lakh crore to ₹2.11 lakh crore. The Modi government is giving subsidy of ₹1200 on each sack of DAP fertiliser. The cadres are being trained on how to reply to the Opposition,” a senior BJP functionary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-to-highlight-schemes-of-modi-yogi-govts-in-run-up-to-uttar-pradesh-assembly-polls-101628362386093.html

Since then, his party has slowly but surely grown, particularly in north Kashmir.Laway, former Rajya Sabha member from south Kashmir, was expelled from PDP after he had attended the swearing-in ceremony of new J&K lieutenant governor GC Murmu in November 2019 months after J&K’s special status was revoked and the region split into two UTs.Fayaz, whose Rajya Sabha tenure ended in February, had become distant from his party and would of late praise PM Narendra Modi for the schemes implemented in J&K.Safina Baig, who won the DDC chairperson post in Baramulla with the help of PC, is wife of former PDP leader and former deputy chief minister Muzaffar Baig.Baig had recently fallen foul of the PC after his utterances during the all-party meeting with the PM on June 24.Laway said after Mufti Mohammad Sayeed’s death, PDP ‘scattered’.“I did not leave PDP but was expelled. After Sayeed’s death, the party dispersed. After his death, there was no direction where to go and hence I decided join PC,” he said.Murtaza Khan said they were the founding members of PDP. “We gave our blood to PDP but with time, the misery against which we had raised our voice hit the party and hence we separated,” he said.Lone, in a statement, said the organisation will immensely benefit from the leaders’ political experience and expand the outreach of the party beyond its strongholds.“They are experienced leaders with a huge base of supporters and will in the coming years play a crucial role in shaping the politics and welfare of J&K. People’s Conference is growing stronger with each passing day. The party is emerging as a formidable political force to reckon with,” he said.He said PC will play a constructive role in the region to create an enabling environment for engagement.Laway said: “There is a leadership deficit in J&K. J&K politics needs new ideas and energy. Lone is the only leader who can take us out of this impasse and restore the rights of people.”Safina Baig said PC is the only party standing for the interests of people of J&K.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/five-members-join-sajad-lone-s-party-101628362326084.html

The government had recently announced austerity measures to ensure availability of sufficient funds to fight against Covid-19 and carry out other necessary work in the state. A need for getting a supplementary budget passed in the state legislature has been felt to finance the new schemes announced in recent months and also provide funds to complete important development projects that chief minister Yogi Adityanath may like to showcase as major achievement ahead of the 2022 assembly elections. “The state government will present the first supplementary demands for grants for 2021-2022,” said minister for finance Suresh Khanna without giving any details about day for presenting the supplementary budget or its size. The Uttar Pradesh government had presented its largest ever annual budget for ₹5,50,270.78 crore on February 22, 2021, despite constraints of adverse impact the Covid-19 has had on the state’s economy. So, the state government will obviously face the challenge of funding the largest size UP budget that incorporated new schemes worth ₹27,598. 40 crores. Yogi had recently announced a new scheme to provide financial assistance to children who lost both or one of their parents in the fight against Covid-19. He also announced a scheme to provide financial assistance to women who lost their husbands and were left with no means to sustain them. The state government may also like to allocate more funds to more such schemes, if any, that may have been announced after the presentation of annual budget for 2021-2022. Will this be the last supplementary budget of BJP government before Uttar Pradesh goes into poll mode 2022 assembly elections? The Samajwadi Party government had presented the second supplementary budget along with a vote on account for the first five months of 2017-2018 in the state legislature on December 21, 2016, before going for 2017 assembly elections in the state. “Since this may be the last budgetary exercise of the state government before announcement of 2022 assembly elections in the state, the focus is likely to be more on welfare measures for different sections of society. The state government will provide budget for schemes that it may like to showcase in 2022 assembly elections. The state government had recently announced austerity measures. It will have to strike a balance between providing enhanced budgetary support to its favourite projects and ensuring that no extra burden is put on the state exchequer as is evident from the austerity measures,” said professor Yashvir Tyagi, former head, economics department, Lucknow University. Tyagi further said, “The state government had presented its annual budget of ₹5.50 lakh crores and under the prevailing circumstances it may not be able to achieve this level of expenditure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-faces-challenge-of-balancing-finances-amid-austerity-measures-101628362147604.html

08-08-2021||Mumbai||NEP: Amid major push for vernacular languages, English still favourite||Even as the National Education Policy (NEP) aims to promote education in mother tongue, the English language continues to be a favourite among parents and students, according to experts.The NEP, passed by the Union cabinet last year, emphasises that at least up to Class 5, students will be taught in vernacular languages wherever possible. In his address last week on NEP’s anniversary, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that 14 engineering colleges in eight states would offer the courses in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi and Bengali.However, English continues to hold an aspirational value for parents, particularly in tier-2 and 3 cities, said Aarti Gupta, co-founder of Qin1, an online learning platform for children in the age group of five to 14 years. “After coding, English is the most sought-after course on our platform. We’ve learnt that parents are willing to invest in their child’s ability to speak and read English well. This is particularly so in the middle-income group families, which is almost two-third of our entire user base,” said Gupta. Qin1, a start-up backed by the Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi, also offers personalised live classes across disciplines such as spoken English, coding and robotics. Parents believe that basic English knowledge increases their children’s chances of employment, said Gupta. Mumbai-based educationist and co-founder of School Leaders Network (SLN) Francis Joseph agreed with Gupta. “You can go to any part of the country and you will find that parents assign an aspirational value to English. It gives the child the confidence to interact at a global level. While there is no harm in learning one’s mother tongue, knowledge in English provides the child access to multiple courses worldwide. The child can get access to global content and resources.”“In school, everybody speaks in their mother tongue, and English is only learnt, not practised. We want our children to be able to read and speak grammatically correct English, which has become essential these days. It will bring a lot of prospects for him,” said the parent of a 12-year-old from Aligarh. They’ve enrolled their child for an English course in Qin1, paying around ₹1,000 a month for the course.Joseph said that one of the reasons for the high demand for English is the higher education system in the country, which is primarily taught in English. However, the Centre is making efforts to address this. The Joint Entrance Exam, which is taken by hundreds of thousands of students every year, is currently being held in English, Hindi and Gujarati. The ministry of education has said that from this year, the exam would be held in more regional languages.Joseph said, “A ‘this’ or ‘that’ approach won’t work. Balance is very critical. Policies should allow both languages to survive. It is expected that NEP will grow into that balance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nep-amid-major-push-for-vernacular-languages-english-still-favourite-101628362086078.html

Narvekar put up the advertisement in Sena mouthpiece Saamana on Tejas’s 25th birthday on Saturday, in which the Sena functionary likened him to Caribbean cricket legend Vivian Richards. In the advertisement, Narvekar wished Tejas and said that he is the “Vivian Richards of the Thackeray family”. Narvekar also posted a tweet describing Tejas’s nature, sparking a buzz in the political circles of another Thackeray family member joining active politics. However, Narvekar, while speaking to TV channels, said that the advertisement should not be linked to politics as he merely wished Tejas on his birthday. He said that while Thackeray’s elder son and state minister Aaditya has qualities of former Indian cricketing great Sunil Gavaskar, Tejas is aggressive like Richards. Senior Sena leaders maintained silence on questions surrounding the political debut of the youngest Thackeray family member. “He [Tejas] has been carrying out his work in wildlife, discovering species, and is being recognised for it... Whatever responsibilities Uddhav ji gives him, he will fulfil them,” said Sena parliamentarian Anil Desai, when asked if Tejas will make his political debut.A senior Sena leader, on the condition of anonymity, said, “So far, there are no discussions within the party on him joining active politics. Apart from Tejas’s, it will also be the family’s decision.” Tejas had accompanied Thackeray for the 2019 election campaign in Sangamner, Ahmednagar, but the Sena chief had ended speculations of his political entry and said that he is keen on wildlife. Tejas is a wildlife enthusiast and has been instrumental in discovering gecko, snake and crab species. Within the party circles, Tejas’s entry is seen as a move that would give a new dimension to Sena’s leadership. “Uddhav ji and Aaditya ji are calm and patient, whereas Tejas does not hide his emotions. He has traits similar to what Balasaheb [Sena founder late Bal Thackeray] had, with measured aggression, decision making, etc,” another Sena functionary said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/close-aide-sparks-buzz-on-maharashtra-cm-s-younger-son-joining-politics-101628361607779.html

Another portion is occupied by her daughter-in-law, while a domestic help and her family is staying in separate quarters on the premises.

08-08-2021||Delhi||At current pace, Delhi will vaccinate its adults by July or August: Govt||At the current pace of the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination drive, Delhi will be able to fully inoculate its entire adult population of 15 million only by July or August next year, the state health department has informed the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).The matter was discussed in a DDMA meeting chaired by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal on Friday, during which the health department said that in order to administer both doses of vaccines to all the adults of the city by December this year, it will need 20 million more doses of Covid-19 vaccines in batches of at least about 4.5 million jabs a month.“But, it is unlikely that the doses will come at this pace every month. In August, Delhi was allocated 1,679,660 doses. At this pace, complete vaccination of the national capital’s entire adult population will be over only by July or August, 2022,” said a senior official, who attended the meeting, on condition of anonymity.“If we have to expedite the vaccination drive, we also have to focus on completing the first dose for every adult, which means around six million doses will ideally be needed for the purpose by next month. But, that seems unlikely, because the Centre’s allocation to states are different depending on the case load,” said the official.A shortage of supplies has forced the Delhi government to regulate the use of doses in all its vaccination centres. The administration has reserved 80% slots for those who have their second dose of Covishield vaccine due, and the remaining 20% are for for first doses. For Covaxin, 60% of the slots are reserved for the second dose, while 40% are for the first. This is because the gap between two doses of Covaxin is shorter (one month) compared to the 12-16-week gap for Covishield.Documents seen by HT showed that so far, Delhi has received 9,376,300 doses of Covid-19 vaccines of which 7,082,270 were Covishield and 2,294,030 were Covaxin. As on Friday, the state government had 745,010 doses of Covid-19 vaccines in stock.Till Friday, Delhi administered at least 10.47 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines. Of these 7.6 million are first doses and 2.8 million are second doses.At least 3.84 million of Delhi’s population aged between 18 and 45 have got their first doses, the highest among the inoculation age groups.But when it comes to those who are fully vaccinated with both the doses, the highest numbers (1.88 million) are among those aged 45 and above. Only 400,000 people aged between 18 and 45 have been fully vaccinated so far.“This is also because the vaccination for those aged 18 and above started much later, in May, whereas jabs for the 45+ group started in April. If doses are given in enough quantities from time to time then Delhi is capable of administering 300,000 doses every day,” said a health official.Delhi government officials said they are simultaneously focusing on enforcing Covid-19 appropriate behaviour in public places, and added that the city’s district administrations have put in place 156 enforcement teams with 129 vehicles.So far in August, teams under the 11 district magistrates in Delhi have issued 25,102 challans, registered 735 FIRs and imposed fines worth ₹4,57,05,300. When compared month-wise since May, the highest prosecutions were made in July, when 211,267 challans were issued, 6,424 FIRs registered and fines worth ₹36.21 crore imposed.The Delhi Police also carries out enforcement drives and in August so far, the force has issued 1,767 challans, arrested 350 people and registered 389 FIRs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/at-current-pace-delhi-will-only-vaccinate-its-adult-population-by-july-or-august-next-year-govt-101628360826137.html

These common people on ground can be vigilant to act as our force multipliers and form a part of our community policing to keep the city safe and secure with greater public cooperation and participation.”“ Our chief said that there should be fear of police among criminals and a sense of security among the law-abiding citizens. The criminals should have fear of law and it can only be instilled if we ourselves are disciplined to core... Insisting on fairness and impartiality, the CP said that criminals have no religion or community and ordered unequivocal strict action on criminals,” Biswal said, adding that Asthana told the force that communal harmony is of utmost importance in the national capital and that it has to be maintained by the police through engagement with leaders of all communities.During the meeting, Asthana told officers that he will also see if duties of law and order and investigation can be separated for all officers at police station. Currently, 30 police stations are trying this model where officers are either posted on investigation or law and order duties, in an effort to ensure productivity and leave no room for clash of tasks.Asthana further said that he is exploring the feasibility of eight-hour shifts for personnel. “We never had shift system in Delhi Police though Mumbai Police,which implemented it, noted an increase in productivity. Maybe he will start shift system at a few police stations and see if it works well, “ said a senior police officer who attended the meeting.During the briefing, Asthana also assured the force that he will hold an open session at his office every Friday to address grievances of police personnel.To be sure, this is the first time that Asthana, a Gujarat cadre IPS officer, is working in the Delhi Police. Senior officers in Delhi Police are from the AGMUT cadre of the Indian Police Service (IPS).The last officer from outside AGMUT cadre to be appointed as Delhi Police chief was Ajai Raj Sharma, an Uttar Pradesh cadre IPS officer, who was commissioner from 1999-2002.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/asthana-hints-at-rejig-of-delhi-police-force-to-improve-productivity-101628360285997.html

08-08-2021||Delhi||Waterlogging, snarls return as rain ends Delhi’s week-long dry spell||After a week-long near dry spell, the national capital on Saturday received “light to moderate” showers in several areas which led to reports of waterlogging and traffic snarls at key stretches in the city.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) initially predicted only light rainfall in some parts of the city, but revised it to an Orange alert for the day on Saturday morning.The weather agency further predicted more showers late on Saturday evening and extended the Orange alert to Sunday when it said there will be “moderate to heavy rainfall” in isolated pockets.According to IMD records, the Safdarjung Observatory, considered representative of Delhi’s weather, received 6.9mm rainfall till 5.30 pm; Delhi Ridge weather station recorded 50.8mm rainfall; Aya Nagar received 2.1mm rain; Lodhi Road received 1.1mm; and Palam witnessed 0.6mm rainfall till 5.30pm.As per Delhi traffic police data, waterlogging and traffic snarls were reported from areas including Vikas Marg (near ITO), Dhaula Kuan, Nizamuddin flyover, AIIMS flyover, Pul Prahladpur underpass, Zakhira underpass, Saket, Malviya Nagar, Karol Bagh and Shahdara, among others.“Even with little rain, Vikas Marg, a major route connecting east Delhi, gets jammed. This has been the issue for years. The government must fix this problem now,” said Ankit Tiwari, a commuter.On Saturday, the maximum temperature was 33.2°C, a notch below the season’s average, and the minimum settled at 27.3°C.Met officials said that light rain is likely over the next two days, after which break monsoon-like conditions are expected to set in, resulting in a significant decrease in rainfall.“From August 10 break monsoon-like conditions will prevail, as the monsoon trough is expected to shift to the Himalayan foothills. The break will remain for four-five days. Monsoon is likely to revive from August 15-16,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.He added that in the absence of rainfall, both day and night temperatures are likely to increase with high humidity levels adding to the discomfort.Independent forecasters too said that break monsoon conditions, that are usual during the monsoon, are likely from next week.“The monsoon trough is in a transition phase. It will move north from August 10-11. The break may last five-six days. Monsoon is expected to revive thereafter from August 16-17,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, Skymet, a private forecaster.Monsoon arrived in Delhi on July 13, at least 16 days behind schedule. Though IMD had predicted that monsoon will arrive in the Capital by June 15, it later revised its forecast and said that break monsoon conditions had delayed its onset.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/waterlogging-snarls-return-as-rain-ends-delhi-s-week-long-dry-spell-101628360047001.html
08-08-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana govt to buy land from farmers to prevent distress sale||To stop distress sale of land by farmers, Haryana has decided to buy it from farmers and create a landbank for planned development and prevent exploitation from middlemen, said a government spokesperson on Saturday.Under this policy, farmers can submit proposals to the government for a potential sale, the spokesperson said.The policy was approved by the Haryana cabinet on Thursday. It would make land available to government departments, including boards and corporations, for development projects. The government also plans to form committees to oversee the implementation of the policy.“Landowners, especially those living outside the country, at times have to make a distress sale of their assets due to slump in the market, due to pandemic, pressure from middlemen in the market or various other reasons, “ said the spokesperson. Such cases make it difficult to provide land for essential services such as waterworks, power sub-stations, colleges and other specialized institutions of higher learning including universities, medical colleges and other hospitals and polytechnics etc, the spokesperson said.The policy also calls for unutilised land from all departments and boards to be clubbed under the revenue and disaster management departments. The revenue department will also make a landbank of evacuee land (lands formerly owned by people who left for Pakistan following partition) and nazul land (a technical term referring to unused government land), while it will also club land categorised as ‘shamlaat deh’ (common areas) and vested with panchayats. All these lands, plus those offered by landowners will be utilised in an optimum manner through this policy, the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/haryana-govt-to-buy-land-from-farmers-to-prevent-distress-sale-101628360045347.html

08-08-2021||Pune||Metro belongs to Pune, not to any party: Fadnavis||PUNE Former chief minister, the BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis tells his party workers and members of the opposition in Pune, not to politicise the Metro project, saying the project belonged to the city and not to any political party. His comments came days after deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar flagged off a trial run of the Metro in Pune on July 30, prompting comments from BJP leaders that Fadnavis was deliberately not invited for the trial run. The Pune Metro carried out its first trial run on a three-km stretch from Vanaz to Anandnagar, on a route that will go all the way to Ramwadi. Fadnavis said it was obvious that Pawar, as guardian minister of Pune district, flagged off the trial run. The former chief minister also clarified that while kick-starting commercial operations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi should be invited for the official launch. Fadnavis, on Saturday, visited the Metro sites at the civil court and Swargate. After the visit he interacted with media. Recently, the BJP’s state unit president, Chandrakant Patil, expressed anger that BJP MPs and MLAs were not involved with the metro trial. Patil alleged that the Metro project was being implemented under pressure from the ruling party in the state, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). “The Metro project is owned by the citizens of Pune. No single party can take credit for it. As Pawar is deputy chief minister, as well as guardian minister of Pune district, it is obvious that he would flag off the trial run. As per progress of the project, the priority stretch would be ready by October this year. While launching the commercial operations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi should be invited, as the Centre has given the maximum funds for this project. International financial institutions also funded the project.” On the the Centre reducing its share in the expenditure for the proposed Katraj-Swargate stretch, Fadnavis said he will try and get maximum finance from the Union government. “Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has already given the nod for the Swargate-Katraj stretch, and it is ready to do the funding. We will also help to get funding from the central government,” Fadnavis said. ‘Pune should get relaxation’ Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has demanded relaxations for Pune city as the positivity rate is constantly coming down. Fadnavis said that the state government took a policy decision to have restrictions where the positivity rate s above 5%. “Pune’s rate is coming down and considering, that traders need to be allowed to run their business for maximum hours.” ‘PPP metro plan will pick up pace soon’Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, in Pune on Saturday to review the Metro project, accepted that one section of project, the route to be developed with public-private partnership (PPP) is far behind the main project being undertaken by Maha-Metro.He said that he expects the PPP metro route from Hinjewadi to Shivajinagar is pick up pace in the coming days.“Metro work in Pune and Nagpur is the fastest in the country in terms of completion. It is true that we had given approval for a third line between Hinjewadi and Shivajinagar, but due to Covid the work was affected. The PPP model gets a little difficult because of land acquisition. I am sure it will speed-up as it is an important corridor,” said Fadnavis.Fadnavis also batted for the HCMTR (High Capacity Mass Transit Project). He said that the decision to have neo Metro on the HCMTR corridor has been taken and it will help improve the city’s traffic.On the hyperloop project, Fadnavis, who introduced the project between Pune and Mumbai during his tenure, did not offer any further information. “The state government will be able to give more information about the project,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/metro-belongs-to-pune-not-to-any-party-fadnavis-101628356325135.html
08-08-2021||Pune||Bleeding woman carried down 11 floors after power cut in Pune||PUNE: A blame game has started between residents of a slum rehabilitation authority (SRA) scheme building and the Maharashtra State Electricity Distributor Company Limited (MSEDCL) after a woman - bleeding from a miscarriage in the eighth month of her pregnancy - had to be manually carried down from the eleventh floor of the building on Friday night after the MSEDCL cut off power due to non-payment of bills for several months.According to residents of the SRA society, the MSEDCL employees kept the power shut even after being informed about the presence of many pregnant women in the building. Whereas MSEDCL employees claim that they turned the electricity back on within 10 to 15 minutes of learning about the bleeding woman having to be carried down manually despite the bills of the society running into Rs6 to 7 lakh.Sachin Mujumale, member of the SRA society and worker at a social organisation called Madat Pratishthan, said, “We get a common bill for the entire building for electricity- and water- usage. The society management kept changing so we could not pay the bill but we managed to clear Rs4 lakh worth of bills while bills to the tune of Rs3 to 3.5 lakh were remaining to be paid. I have a recording of a call I made to a MSEDCL employee, pleading with him for an extension of one week as there are many pregnant women in the building but he did not listen.”However the MSEDCL official Mujumale was referring to said that he got a call from another person who explained the situation and promised to get a cheque of Rs1 lakh payable towards the society’s bill on Saturday morning.Sayas Sopanrao Darade, executive engineer, Parvati division, MSEDCL, said, “I turned on the electricity within minutes of the call by Nilesh Chavan from the society. We are not monsters. For the sake of humanity, we did not shut the power of 60 private home meters in the building even though some of them have bills worth Rs50,000 pending.”“They have been getting reminders for several months but neither the residents, builders nor the government have responded to our warnings. We were told to cut-off power supply for pending bills of more than Rs1 lakh which we did. But Pune is now under pressure as there are around 1 lakh people who have not paid their bills and the state government has directed us not to collect from places such as Sangli, Kolhapur and Ratnagiri due to the floods,” Darade said.Purva Jadhav – who started bleeding on Friday night while she was with her elderly mother-in-law - had to be manually carried down from the eleventh floor of the 13-storeyed building. She was put in a rickshaw at around 10.40pm and taken to Godbole hospital from where she was ferried to Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital in an ambulance. Calls and messages to Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director, Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital, went unanswered on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bleeding-woman-carried-11-floors-down-sra-bldg-after-power-cut-due-to-bill-nonpayment-101628355245019.html
08-08-2021||Other||‘Puaada first Punjabi film to hit the theatres after pandemic’||Punjab’s beloved onscreen couple Ammy Virk and Sonam Bajwa are set to recreate their magic in upcoming romantic comedy, Puaada, which will hit theatres on August 12, post-Covid pandemic. The stars talk about their film, upcoming projects, coping during the lockdown and adjusting to the post-Covid world. Excerpts:Tell us about your character in Puaada?Sonam: My character’s name is Ronak. She is almost done with her masters and falls in love with a milkman, Jaggi (played by Ammy), who comes to the college to drop milk. She has a defense background and the family is not in favour of the relationship. That’s where the conflict starts. There is also a cute surprise for the viewers. It is a refreshing film after almost two years being affected by the pandemic. It can be enjoyed with the family. We had a blast while shooting.What was the most challenging aspect of filming?Ammy: We mostly shot the film in the same clothes. The characters were not particularly challenging as we have played similar roles earlier as well but the plot is that of ‘pange pe panga’ following the characters at each step. It’s a unique story.This is your fourth film together. After delivering three successive hits did you feel the pressure of recreating the magic?Sonam: Rather than feeling the pressure, it gives us a sense of confidence. We do feel a little nervous as a lot has happened since early 2020. We are slowly and steadily trying to return to normalcy, and this will be the first Punjabi film to hit the theatres after the pandemic. We feel a lot of responsibility as many people depend on the film industry and need work to keep rolling it. In fact, I want to congratulate our producers for deciding to go ahead and release the film. I want everything to stay smooth so that people can come and enjoy our film with their families in a happy frame of mind.Ammy, you produced around 20-23 covers during the lockdown. Would you say you were at your creative best?Ammy: Usually, even if we think that we will take a month or two months off that never happens. This time it was God’s way of telling us to take a break. In the first five days of the lockdown, I downloaded all OTT apps and caught up on many shows. After that, I would go to the studio late at night. There would be no one there and I would just start making covers to entertain people as there was no way to earn money. I reasoned that at least it will increase my followers, thus helping with endorsements. My Instagram followers increased by 2.4 million through covers and videos. Then, I shot three to four songs.Were you stressed out when the movie’s release was pushed indefinitely from June 2020 due to lockdown?Sonam: I’m still away from all of this. People who put in their money were going through a lot. I was grateful to be healthy as we heard people were not even getting beds in hospitals. Some people were cribbing about being bored (during the lockdown) but life is about much more than that. We are so privileged as we have food of our choice, television, internet, electricity, etc so I had absolutely no complaints. However, when the lockdown went on for months I was scared and anxious as to when this will end. I haven’t met my parents for two years and was very nervous about my mom. I started waiting for the day when I could hug them after a shoot. It’s also made me a bit paranoid. But I also got some me-time after years and learnt photography, attended some online acting workshops, and learnt meditation.What’s your favourite song from Puaada?Sonam: Mine would be ‘Dil Mera Ponda Boliyan’.Ammy: (sings) ‘Aye Haye Jattiye Kamaal Laggi Jandi Hai’What were the challenges of shooting in Covid times?Sonam: It is difficult but all precautions have to be followed. We had to apply masks after applying makeup. It was more difficult for the team as they had to be in full PPE kits while doing the hair and makeup. I was already a hygiene freak, now I keep reminding people to wash their hands.Ammy: I have done three films after the Covid breakout. While our immunity is relatively good, it was scary returning home due to the fear of transmitting the virus to the elderly and the children.Are you excited about your Bollywood debuts?Ammy: I am very excited. I worked on Bhuj: The Pride of India with Ajay Devgn, and on 83.Sonam, you turned host with Dil Diyan Gallan. How was the experience?Sonam: I had not met so many people in last few years. So, I got an opportunity to meet friends, make some new ones, and meet people I admire such as Satinder Sartaaj and Gurlez Akhtar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ours-is-first-punjabi-film-to-hit-the-theatres-after-pandemic-101628334123625.html

They accuse the federal government of exploiting the natural resources of the province.Chief Minister of Balochistan Jam Kamal Khan has condemned the incident."Terrorist elements want to ruin the province's peace. [We] will never allow terrorists to succeed in their nefarious plans," he was quoted as saying in a statement.A Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) spokesperson said that the police van was targeted via an improvised explosive device (IED) attached to a motorcycle.Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) chief Shehbaz Sharif said that the government must put in place measures to ensure the safety of lives and property of the people.Pakistan People’s Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, who is on a visit to Quetta, also condemned the blast and said that the government "must stop appeasing terrorists and implement the National Action Plan."The attack comes more than three months after a powerful bomb exploded in the parking lot of the Serena Hotel, killing five people and wounding a dozen others.The Chinese ambassador was staying in the hotel but was out at the time of the attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-blast-near-serena-hotel-in-quetta-leaves-2-cops-dead-12-injured-101628443506039.html
08-08-2021||World||Russian president Vladimir Putin to attend Modi’s UNSC debate||Russian President Vladimir Putin, Democratic Republic of Congo President Felix-Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo, who is also president of the African Union, and US secretary of state Antony Blinken are among the top dignitaries who are expected to attend the UN Security Council (UNSC) debate on maritime security that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will chair on Monday.UN diplomats familiar with the organisation of the meeting said confirmations are still coming in and the list of those likely to participate in the debate could grow.The Monday meeting will be the first UNSC debate to be chaired by an Indian prime minister, though this is the eighth time India has the rotational presidency of the top world body as a non-permanent member. Modi will chair the debate virtually in view of the continuing Covid pandemic.The maritime security debate is the first of three signature events India is holding as UNSC chair for August. The other two are debates on UN Peacekeeping, to which India has been a generous and steadfast contributor, and counter-terrorism, which is a subject India has championed at the world body for decades as a leading victim, specially from state-sponsored groups and individuals across its western border. Indian external affairs minister S Jaishankar will chair the other two, and in-person at the UN headquarters in New York City.President Putin’s participation was noted as a significant gesture as he rarely attends such debates; the last one, people familiar with the matter, said was possibly 15 years ago.DRC’s President Tshisekedi is participating in the debate as a briefer on behalf of the African Union, 54 of whose members are part of the 55-member Africa group, which is the largest group of geographically categorised groups that UN members are divided into. Prime Minister of St Vincent and Grenadines Ralph Gonsalves was confirmed to participate as well but has pulled out for health reasons and will be represented by his son, who is a member of the cabinet.India’s presidency of the UNSC, meanwhile, faced its first pushback and from expected quarters. Pakistan has reacted strongly to the UNSC’s rejection of its formal request to attend the Friday briefing by the UN Assistance Mission on Afghanistan (UNMA) on the evolving security situation in the country as US-led international forces end their 20-year presence.“It is a matter of deep regret that, as the closest neighbour of Afghanistan, whose contribution in the ongoing peace process has been recognised by the international community, Pakistan’s request to the president of the Security Council to address the council’s session and present its perspective on the Afghan peace process and the way forward was not acceded to,” Pakistan’s ministry of foreign affairs said on Saturday.Pakistan had indeed made a formal request, but people familiar with the matter said, it was turned down because, one, neighbours do not automatically qualify to attend or address under rules, as are affected countries - as Afghanistan which attended. And, two, “where do you stop if all neighbours make the same request, to attend”.Some of Afghanistan’s other neighbouring countries had indeed expressed the desire to attend and address the meeting, but they were politely turned down as well, citing the same reason.Pakistan took aim in the comment at the president of the council, which for August is India. But, the people cited earlier insisted, the decision to keep out neighbours was taken collectively by the UN Security Council as a body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-president-to-attend-modi-s-unsc-debate-101628440871129.html

Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar III, the Sultan of Sokoto and the president general of the Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA), has asked Muslims to look out for the new moon of Muharram on Sunday. Abubakar issued the directive on Saturday, according to a Guardian report."Muslims are, therefore, requested to start looking out for the new moon on Sunday and report its sighting to the nearest District or Village Head for onward communication to the Sultan," he said.Authorities in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and other regions in the Middle East will decide the date for Muharram.Khaleej Times reported citing the Astronomy Centre that the moon is unlikely to be sighted on Sunday and therefore, the first of Muharram will fall on Tuesday across most Islamic countries. The Islamic new year will also begin on August 10 in the UAE, Khaleej Times said citing Dubai's Islamic affairs and charitable activities department calendar.Last week, the UAE's ministry of human resources and Emiratisation announced that the Hijri New Year holiday for the year 1443 would be marked by the public and private sectors on Thursday, August 12, this year.Muharram is the first month in the Islamic calendar and is one of the four sacred months mentioned in the Quran, along with the seventh month of Rajab, and the eleventh and twelfth months of Dhul-Qadah and Dhul-Hijjah, respectively. The Islamic New Year is based on the lunar system unlike the Gregorian New Year, which is based on the solar system. Islamic Hijri months also have either 29 or 30 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/muharram-2021-announcement-on-islamic-new-year-likely-today-101628432713161.html

The US Air Force Central Command is using heavy-duty B-52 bombers and AC-10 Spectre gunships to attack Taliban positions in Pashtun strongholds of south and east Afghanistan. US planes have also bombed Sheberghan in Jowzan and Lashkar Gah in Helmand. The US forces are to exit Afghanistan on August 31.According to diplomats based in Kabul, it is evident that the Taliban, despite public assurances from neighbouring Pakistan, is in no mood to share power through negotiations and the entire western strategy of the US and the UK has gone to pieces. A peace process meeting scheduled to be held in Islamabad from August 17 to August 19 now stands postponed indefinitely. Primarily, the Islamabad meeting was the brainchild of UK army chief General Nick Carter and the US-Afghan Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad.Also watch | 'Stop Taliban or...': Afghanistan warns world as US, UK ask citizens to exitNow efforts are being made to call Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani on a state visit to Islamabad and have a discreet one to one meeting with the Taliban military council on the sidelines.

The Afghan troika meeting is also scheduled on August 11 at Doha with the UN, the EU, Qatar, Turkey and Iran joining the confabulations as special invitees.

It's a pretty cruel disease," said Diego, who did not want to give his full name.He is one of 16 coronavirus patients being treated in the same hospital in Coacalco.Unlike during the first two waves of the pandemic, most of the sick are in their 20s and 30s.Mexico's official Covid-19 death toll of more than 244,000 is the fourth highest in the world, and the actual figure is believed to be significantly higher.The government says that is partly a reflection of the country's large population, but is also due to the prevalence of underlying health problems, including obesity, hypertension and diabetes.The country has registered nearly three million confirmed cases since the pandemic began, of which around 138,000 are active.- No lockdown -Experts say the latest wave of infections is due to the arrival of the Delta variant of the virus, as well as reduced social distancing, particularly among younger Mexicans.The Mexico City authorities on Friday ruled out imposing any new lockdown measures, despite the health ministry raising the capital's alert status to the highest level."Right now it seems that neither the government nor anyone is interested in making people stay at home again," said Jesus Victoria, the head of nursing at the hospital in Coacalco.Although people aged between 18 and 29 began to be vaccinated in late July, it was too late for some of the patients at the clinic, he said."We've been able to discharge most of them, but we have also had many deaths of young people," Victoria said."I don't know if as a society we are failing, if the government is failing. Shopping centers are open, cinemas, sports centers. It complicates things," he added.Thanks to vaccinations, hospitalizations remain far below a peak seen in January when occupancy rose above 90 percent.Now around half of general beds and 58 percent of those equipped with ventilators are available, according to the government.Almost 50 million people in the country of 126 million have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and 27 million of them are fully vaccinated, the health ministry says.- Bars, parties -Hector Lopez, a 26-year-old computer programmer who is also hospitalized for Covid-19, said that in hindsight his family was not careful enough."Usually I don't go out. The problem is that my relatives do," he said."I had been taking care of myself. I hadn't gone out unless it was necessary," he added, as machines monitored his vital signs.Lopez, who is expected to be discharged soon, said he had seen on social media that friends were going out more, despite the risks."It was very easy to see that they were in a bar or at a party as if nothing was happening," he said.Mayra Jimenez, another patient, believes the Delta variant is so infectious that anyone who has avoided catching it without taking extra care is very lucky."We didn't go to parties or gatherings," said the 39-year-old, who is using a medical device to help her lungs recover."Fortunately I came through it okay, but there are people who are in a really bad way," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-variant-no-joke-young-mexicans-warn-from-hospital-101628404448930.html

It was celebrated for the first time in 2002 by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), an animal welfare organisation, one of the largest in the world, based out of Canada.International Cat Day is celebrated to help raise public awareness about cats, to learn about ways to keep and protect them. Many countries also celebrate national cat days to raise awareness about feline adoption. Canada and the US also celebrate national cat day in their countries on August 8 and October 29, respectively. Japan marks national cat day on February 22 and Russia on March 1.In 2020, the custodianship of International Cat Day passed on from IFAW to British non-profit International Cat Care, a charity founded in 1958 by feline lovers working to spread information about cat health and welfare. The organisation states their “Aim is to enable and inspire people to understand cats’ individual needs and perspective, and to act in the interests of each cat’s welfare. We do this by creating and sharing knowledge, insights, skills and current best practice so people can feel confident in their ability to help cats and to challenge ignorance and misconceptions,”Theme of International Cat Day 2021International Cat Care has decided on the campaign ‘Be cat curious’ to celebrate this year’s International Cat Day. The campaign encourages cat owners to spend quality time with their pets and learn more about them. The organisation says 95% of cat owners want more advice on training their cats, with at least half saying they struggled to get their cat into the cat carrier. Hence, this year’s International Cat Day will be celebrated to encourage training for cats and their owners. Cat owners have also been invited to share their experiences of training their pets||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-cat-day-2021-theme-and-significance-101628401004540.html

That person's condition was not released.The officers were taken to University of Chicago Medical Center where one of the officers — a woman — died. The other officer was “fighting for his very life,” Carter said.A large crowd of officers had gathered outside the hospital's ambulance entrance after the shooting. Carter gave the news conference with the gathering as a backdrop, flanked by Mayor Lori Lightfoot who gave her condolences.“The officer who succumbed to her injuries was very young on the job, but incredibly enthusiastic to do the work,” Lightfoot said.Two of the people who were in the vehicle were in custody, Carter said.

08-08-2021||World||Canada relaxes norms for entry of US citizens, permanent residents||Canada is proceeding with its plan to drop restrictions for discretionary travel for American citizens and permanent residents starting on Monday despite a steep surge in Covid-19 cases in the United States.The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) has reiterated the easing of those border measures despite new daily cases in the US crossing 100,000 and Canada itself recording an increase from 250 two weeks earlier to 517 on Saturday .The United States has also not reciprocated and restrictions remain as they were till at least August 21.The Canadian announcement of relaxing norms for Americans came on July 19 and was described as “a first step” towards allowing non-essential travel into the country with easing for all international travellers who are fully vaccinated with a vaccine authorised by Health Canada, and completed their full series at least 14 days prior to entering Canada.At that time, however, the Public Health Agency of Canada said, “Border measures also remain subject to change as the epidemiological situation evolves. As Canada looks to welcome fully vaccinated travellers from the U.S., the federal government will continue to monitor the situation and provide updated travel advice to Canadians.” Cases in America have increased nearly tenfold since that statement.Starting Monday, Canada is doing away with the requirement for air passengers to take an RT-PCR test on arrival in Canada and then quarantine at a government-mandated hotel till the result was available.Canada still requires travellers, including those from the US, to provide a valid pre-arrival molecular test result. Children below 12 are exempted from quarantine as jabs for them are not approved in Canada or America.Meanwhile, direct flights from India remain banned till August 22, though travellers can still come to the country via a third nation but provide the result of an RT-PCR test from the port of departure for their Canadian destination.A release from the CBSA underscored that the US hasn’t placed similar relaxations for Canadians, as it said, “While Canada is moving forward with these measures, it’s important to note that the US is not opening its land border to Canadians for discretionary (non-essential) travel at this time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-relaxes-norms-for-entry-of-us-citizens-permanent-residents-101628399708742.html

The development comes weeks after Pakistan banned TikTok for the fourth time in the country on account of "inappropriate content" on the platform and its failure to take down such videos. Athar Minallah, the chief justice of the IHC, has reportedly asked the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to reconsider the ban on TikTok, especially since the telecommunication regulator has "failed to justify blocking the video-sharing app"."The TikTok app is a source of income for the underprivileged," the report quoted an extract from the judgment passed by the Islamabad high court on Saturday. According to the agency, the telecom regulator has also been asked to submit a report to the court regarding the matter on August 23.The Pakistan Telecommunications Authority had notified on July 21 that it had blocked ByteDance's video-sharing platform TikTok in the country. The ban was imposed under relevant provisions of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016. This was reportedly the fourth time that the app was shown the door in the country. All the earlier bans were reversed when the app promised to moderate its content.The first time TikTok was banned in Pakistan was in October 2020. However, the ban was lifted 10-day later after the company assured that it would block accounts "spreading obscenity".The Peshawar high court had imposed a ban on Tiktok in March which was lifted in April. In June, the Sindh high court asked the telecommunication authority to block TikTok as it was spreading immorality and obscenity. This order was also lifted after three days.TikTok is much popular in Pakistan, though protests against the app have also grown louder over time. The app, which is banned in neighbouring India, has been downloaded almost 39 million times in Pakistan.TikTok has said that more than 6 million videos were removed from the app in Pakistan in the last three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/source-of-income-for-underprivileged-islamabad-high-court-asks-pak-authorities-to-review-tiktok-ban-101628397297375.html

That brings the number of local infections since the latest outbreak began in mid June to 5,169.“Vaccination is the key,” Berejiklian said. She’s aiming to have 6 million people in the state inoculated by the end of the month, up from about 4.4 million ast present.Victoria, whose state capital Melbourne is in its sixth lockdown, announced 11 new cases on Sunday, down from 29 on Saturday. State Premier Daniel Andrews urged Victorians to get vaccinated, saying that’s “critical to us being open and staying open.”There were nine new cases in Queensland, where state Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said a lockdown will ease in the southeast on Sunday. New stay-at-home orders were imposed for three days in the northern city of Cairns.The highly contagious delta variant has caused shutdowns across Australia’s eastern coast, its most populated area. Delta is placing increased pressure on the nation’s so-called “Covid-zero” strategy, which has relied on closed international borders and rigorous testing to eliminate community transmission of the virus.The central bank estimates household spending drops about 15% during lockdown and has acknowledged the economy will likely contract this quarter. Still, it expects a robust recovery to resume, and decided to stick with plans to taper bond purchases for now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-delta-outbreak-continues-as-vaccination-push-ramps-up-101628390165761.html
08-08-2021||World||'Closest neighbour': Pakistan issues statement on India's snub at UNSC meeting on Afghanistan||Pakistan Foreign Office has issued a statement regretting that it was not invited to the United National Security Council meeting on the situation in Afghanistan, despite being the closest neighbour of the conflict-ridden country. Under India's Presidency, the 15-member council held a meeting on the situation of Afghanistan on Sunday where India took a veiled dig at Pakistan for providing safe havens to terrorists. "For enduring peace in Afghanistan, terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries in the region must be dismantled immediately and terrorist supply chains disrupted. It needs to be ensured that Afghanistan’s neighbours and the region are not threatened by terrorism, separatism, and extremism," Indian Ambassador to the UN T S Tirumurti said."Pakistan is the closest neighbour of Afghanistan whose contribution in the ongoing peace process has been recognized by the international community. Pakistan’s constructive efforts with the support of the international community led to important milestones in Doha peace process. Pakistan calls upon all sides in Afghanistan to eschew the military approach and work together to secure an inclusive, broad-based and comprehensive political settlement. It is equally important to remain cognisant of spoilers, both within and outside," Pakistan's foreign office said.Won’t accept a govt imposed by force in Afghanistan: UNSCAt the UNSC discussion, Afghanistan's Permanent Representative to the UN Ghulam Isaczai launched a scathing attack on Pakistan, saying it was providing safe haven and logistical support to the Taliban.Pakistan foreign office, in its statement, said the request to present the country's perspective on the Afghan peace process was not acceded to but the platform was "made available to enable the peddling of a false narrative against Pakistan". "Pakistan categorically rejects these accusations. Pakistan's position on the issue has been shared with Security Council members,” it said adding that its stand on Afghanistan situation remains the same as it believes that there is no military solution to the Afghan conflict and the only way to long-lasting peace lies in political compromise.Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan earlier said Taliban are normal citizens and not any military outfit that the Pakistan army can hunt them down. At the UNSC meeting, the Afghan Ambassador to the UN, Ghulam Isaczai, said Afghanistan is prepared to provide evidence in support of its claim that Pakistan is ensuring a supply chain to the Taliban."Should members of the Security Council want that evidence, we are ready to provide them," Ghulam said adding that evidence was provided to Islamabad as well. "In a deliberate act of barbarism Taliban isn't alone. They're assisted by foreign fighters from transnational terrorist networks. Together they are threatening peace, security and stability in Afghanistan and also in our region and beyond," Isaczai said.The UNSC said the council will not support political structure in the name of the Islamic Emirate (Taliban rule) in Afghanistan again. The UN body also expressed its concern over reports of growing human rights violations in Afghanistan, ANI said quoting Pajhwok Afghan News.As the conflict is going on in Afghanistan, Zaranj, the capital city of Nimroz province, and Shiberghan, the provincial capital of Jawzjan, had fallen to the Taliban and fighting is underway currently in Helmand's capital Lashkargah, Kandahar City and Sar-e-Pul City.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/closest-neighbour-pakistan-issues-statement-on-india-s-snub-at-unsc-meeting-on-afghanistan-101628387308996.html

Democrats hold a narrow majority there, and the party's centrist and liberal wings have butted heads over the content of the bill.Final passage by both houses would represent a major victory for the Democratic president, who has been betting his political legacy on economic recovery and the fight against the ravages of Covid-19.Biden's Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, issued a statement Saturday calling the bill "a disgrace."Trump, who was unable to bring an infrastructure bill to passage during his four-year term, added that it would be "very hard" for him to "endorse anyone foolish enough to vote in favor of this deal."His position could make a final vote more problematic for Republicans looking ahead to the 2022 midterm elections.But Republicans also know that the spending in the bill is very popular among voters, according to polls.elc/bbk/sw/bgs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-1-2-trillion-infrastructure-bill-passes-key-hurdle-with-senate-vote-101628385262428.html

08-08-2021||World||Taliban seize 2nd provincial capital||The Taliban seized the capital of northern Afghanistan’s Jawzjan province on Saturday, a provincial lawmaker said, the second provincial capital to fall to the insurgents in under 24 hours.The deputy governor of Jawzjan province Qader Malia told AFP he was with government forces who had abandoned Sheberghan city and retreated to the airport on its outskirts, where they were preparing to defend themselves.He said Sheberghan had “unfortunately fallen”, but the government denied the claims.Interior ministry spokesman Marwais Stanikzai insisted the insurgents held only parts of the city. “The security forces, backed by reinforcements and the uprising forces, will once again clear the city from the terrorists,” he said in a video message to media.Sheberghan is particularly strategic because it is the stronghold of US-allied Uzbek warlord Rashid Dostum, whose militias are among those resurrected to aid the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces.Aides said he was meeting with President Ashraf Ghani on Saturday in an attempt to persuade the country’s leader to fly in reinforcements.Heavy airstrikes were reported by residents of Sheberghan who also said the Taliban had freed prisoners from the city jail. One resident of Sheberghan contacted by AFP said people were staying behind closed doors, fearful for their future.On Saturday, the US and British embassies in Kabul repeated a warning to its citizens still there to leave “immediately” as the security situation deteriorated. The US air force continues to aid the Afghan air force’s bombing of Taliban targets in southern Helmand and Kandahar provinces as Afghan security forces try to prevent a Taliban takeover.In a report to the UN Security Council on Friday, the UN envoy for Afghanistan urged the council to demand the Taliban immediately stop attacking cities in their offensive to take more territory. Deborah Lyons also called on the international community to urge both sides to stop fighting and negotiate to prevent a “catastrophe” in the country.On Friday, Taliban fighters assassinated Dawa Khan Menapal, the chief of the Afghan government’s press operations for local and foreign media. It came just days after a coordinated attempt was made to kill acting defence chief Bismillah Khan Mohammadi in Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-seize-2nd-provincial-capital-101628380000826.html
08-08-2021||World||Expedite process of issuing visas to international students: Senators to US govt||A bipartisan group of influential senators on Friday urged the Biden Administration to accelerate the process of issuing visas to international students, a move likely to benefit thousands of Indians who want to join their classes this Fall.In India, for instance in Delhi, only emergency visas are currently being issued by the US Embassy, as a result of which a large number of Indian students are uncertain about their academic future for the next session beginning this Fall.There are over 100,000 Indian students in the US and they contribute significantly to the American economy.“We write to express our concerns regarding the slow pace of processing student visas as we continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic,” two dozen senators wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Tony Blinken.“In order to welcome international students and scholars in the Fall, as competitor countries are doing, we urge the State Department to provide predictable and consistent consular services, maximise alternatives to in-person visa interviews by providing waivers and virtual interviews, extend visa eligibility waivers, authorise staff overtime and increase hiring, and initiate meaningful engagement with outside stakeholders and agencies,” they said.“We are at a critical point in the academic calendar when international students and scholars must make visa appointments and plan their travel to the United States,” they added.The senators further said while some US consulates are reopening, most are still operating at lower capacity levels and there remains limited access to visa appointments.Prospective students cannot be certain about whether their visas will be processed in time for them to travel to the United States to begin their studies, the senators wrote.“While we appreciate that a National Interest Exception for international students has been created, the processing of these visas in a timely way continues to be a challenge. International students coming to the United States provide significant and essential value to the higher education system and our economy,” they stressed.Data from the Association of International Educators shows that more than one million international students at US colleges and universities during the 2018-2019 academic year contributed USD 41 billion to the country's economy.Furthermore, bringing international students to the United States enriches the educational experience of domestic students that would be more difficult to achieve through online formats.There are also practical barriers to online learning by international students while physically outside the United States such as not all countries have reliable electricity or internet access and time zone differences require some students to appear online for classes in the middle of the night, the senators said.There are also countries that limit access to certain information or websites while the US also bars the sharing of certain information with other countries, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expedite-process-of-issuing-visas-to-international-students-senators-to-us-govt-101628379795237.html
08-08-2021||India||Patna completes 1 lakh Covid-19 vaccinations in a day, ranks fifth in India||Patna administered 1,36,560 doses of Covid-19 vaccines on Saturday, the highest achieved on the day by any district in India, and also became only the fifth in India to cross the 1 lakh vaccination mark in a single day, officials said. Patna’s contribution was 27% of the state’s achievement of 5,09,447 doses administered on Saturday. “We surpassed Bengaluru (88,327), Ahmedabad (55,988), Mumbai (53,988), Belgaum (49,513), Kurnool (49,203), Surat (48,691), Dehradun (44,495) and Chennai (41,357) in terms of Covid jabs on Saturday,” said Patna’s district magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh. “We also earned the unique distinction of joining the elite club of five districts in India to cross the 1 lakh mark of Covid-19 vaccinations in a single day,” he added. Indore, with 2,27,349 doses in a day, tops the list of such districts, followed by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (1,73,960), Bhopal (1,56,137) and Ujjain (1,05,314). Patna has now administered 95% first dose vaccination to its urban adult population and 33% to the rural masses. The district’s first-dose achievement was 53% against the state’s 32%. The district has administered 13,61,533 doses to its 43,49,131 target population so far. Patna had achieved 18% full immunisation against the state’s 6% coverage of the target population of 7.22 crore to have taken both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, said Dr SP Vinayak, Patna’s district immunisation officer. The 17 special vaccination centres in Patna, set up in May and June, had administered 9,02,277 doses of the 13,61,533 doses till Saturday. Of this, the three vaccination centres at the Patliputra Sports Complex, Patliputra Ashok Hotel and the Government Polytechnic College in Patliputra that operate 24x7, accounted for 41% (3,70,845 doses). These three centres are managed by Care India, which provides technical support to the state government in implementation of the health programme. Patna had 262 vaccination sessions on Saturday. “There is no hesitancy anywhere now. People from rural areas are calling up our field officers to know about the availability of vaccines in their respective areas. Now that we have almost saturated the urban areas, we shall turn our attention to vaccination in rural areas from August 10,” said Singh, in response to the vaccine hesitancy in rural areas, which had led to low first-dose coverage (33%). “In addition to the 86 “Teeka Express” or mobile vaccine vans, we have four special vans, which will have vaccinators, data-entry operators as well as artistes to perform “nukkad-natak” or street plays to sensitise people about vaccination in a handful of remote areas where people are delaying taking their jabs. In addition, we will also take help from NGOs working in those areas,” he added. Though chief minister Nitish Kumar has set a target for his officers to complete Covid-19 vaccination in the state by December, Patna hopes to do it before the given deadline, subject to availability of vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/patna-completes-1-lakh-covid-19-vaccinations-in-a-day-ranks-fifth-in-india-101628445371412.html

The Zayed Talwar exercise came amid rising tensions in the Gulf region where a drone attack on a merchant vessel led to the death of a British and a Romanian citizen a week ago. The UK and the US blamed Iran for the attack on the merchant vessel MV Mercer Street, a charge denied by Tehran.During the exercise on Saturday, the Indian Navy deployed warship INS Kochi and two Sea King MK 42B helicopters. The UAE deployed Baynunah class guided missile corvette, Al Dhafra and an AS-565B Panther helicopter.“As part of the exercise, the ships undertook tactical manoeuvres, over the horizon targeting, search and rescue and electronic warfare drills to enhance interoperability and synergy between the two navies,” Commander Vivek Madhwal, the Indian Navy’s spokesperson, told news agency PTI.Madhwal said helicopters practised search and rescue operations during the military drill and passing of targeting data to ships for simulated missile engagement drills.The exercise also came a week after Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria’s visit to the UAE. In December last year, General MM Naravane visited the UAE and Saudi Arabia in a first-ever visit by the head of the Indian Army to the two important Gulf countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-uae-carry-out-naval-exercise-deepen-military-cooperation-101628443058494.html

Gogoi had earlier met TMC chief and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee at Kolkata. Three rounds of meetings between Raijor Dal and TMC have already taken place. People aware of the development in Gogoi’s party said that they have decided not to merge with TMC. “If we have to remove Prime Minister Narendra Modi from power, a confederation of regional parties will play an important role. Hence under the leadership of Mamata Banerjee, all regional parties of India have to come together,” he added. Gogoi mentioned that Raijor Dal has started talks with Congress to discuss the coming by-polls in Assam and the prospect of opposition parties, except All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) joining hands. “We’ve had initial discussions with Congress. Some of their leaders are saying that they want to part ways with AIUDF, which was part of the ‘grand alliance’ for the assembly polls,” By-polls in at least five seats are to be held in the coming weeks after two newly elected MLAs died due to Covid-19, two Congress MLAs quit the party and joined BJP and former CM and Majuli MLA Sarbananda Sonowal joined the Union Cabinet last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-wants-my-party-to-merge-with-tmc-says-raijor-dal-chief-akhil-gogoi-101628441651503.html

On one side they talk about austerity measures, reduce expenditure, while committed expenditure is 102%. They (government) say that it has become difficult to pay interest, salaries, pensions and subsidies and on the other hand they are doing this,” Siddaramaiah, former chief minister and leader of the opposition said.He, however, said that it was a good thing that Yediyurappa was giving up the cabinet rank, which has never been accorded to anyone who has held the position in Karnataka before.Bommai tried to show his loyalty to Yediyurappa in more ways than one and meets the latter on a regular basis, indicating that the 78-year-old continues to remain in charge of the functioning of the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yediyurappa-asks-karnataka-cm-bommai-to-withdraw-cabinet-rank-assigned-to-him-101628438051221.html

The serpent was found before the flight was to leave for Mumbai.According to the report, passengers were yet to board the aircraft, which had landed at the airport from Raipur, and was parked at a secluded bay area, when the incident occurred. A baggage handler saw the snake, which was curled around a baggage belt in the plane. The ground staff immediately cleared the area and informed airport authorities who, in turn, informed the forest department. The snake was rescued by forest department officials, who took it away for rehabilitation.The massive reptile, officials said, was a non-poisonous rat snake, which, they speculated, made its way into the plane while baggage was being off loaded from the flight upon arrival from Raipur.The incident took place on August 5. Journalist Tarun Shukla took to Twitter to share a video and a photo of the snake. “Perhaps the snake wanted an IndiGo flight as a belated 15th birthday offer yesterday. Thankfully taken away by the Kolkata forest department. But just look at the speed,” Shukla tweeted on August 6. IndiGo, which is headquartered in Gurugram, commenced operations on August 4, 2006.And when it was inside.. 🐍 pic.twitter.com/1h8L8FdWm7Meanwhile, passengers who were due to board the Mumbai-bound flight, were sent to their destination on another aircraft, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/snake-found-onboard-mumbai-bound-indigo-flight-at-kolkata-airport-101628435860470.html
08-08-2021||India||Kerala to enforce new Covid-19 containment rules from August 11||Amid a steep hike in Covid-19 cases, the Kerala government has decided to implement new guidelines from August 11 allowing only those who have taken at least one dose of the vaccine or who are in possession of RT-PCR negative certificates taken 72 hours before to enter shops, markets, banks and tourist spots.This is applicable for both workers and visitors and the state disaster control management authority said it will deploy its personnel in malls and other places to ensure this. Though traders’ bodies and opposition parties opposed the new restrictions, state health minister Veena George justified it saying in critical situations such measures are needed.On Sunday, Covid-19 cases came down to 20,000 after a week. Kerala reported 18,607 cases with a test positivity rate of 13.87 per cent after 1,34,196 samples were tested, said the state health ministry. It also reported 93 deaths taking the total death toll to 17,747. The intensity of the situation in the state can be gauged if compared with national statistics-- in the last 24 hours the country reported 39,070 cases and 491 deaths and out of 4.06,822 active cases the state’s share is 1,76,572.Kerala had announced fresh guidelines on August 4 as coronavirus cases continued to rise exponentially. According to the new guidelines, only people who have taken at least one dose of the vaccine before two weeks, or who are in possession of RT-PCR negative certificates taken 72 hours before or who are in possession of Covid-19 positive results more than a month old, will be allowed inside shops, banks and other establishments. But traders opposed it and asked the government to provide enough vaccines before enforcing such rules.“There are many loopholes. If a person wants to buy two packets of milk he has to take a test costing ₹500 or a vaccine worth ₹600. What about people below 18 years of age? These measures are without any thinking or logic,” said a trader M Pankajan in the state capital. Opposition parties also said such steps will lead to more harassment from law-enforcement agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-to-enforce-new-covid-19-containment-rules-from-august-11-101628435050804.html

In a Facebook post, the CM said special Covid-19 vaccination camps were organised in five schools in the panchayat and nearby areas to provide vaccines to all residents. People staying in remote areas were brought to these schools by vehicles provided by the tribal department. Those who could not reach camps were inoculated in their colonies, the CM said while lauding all involved in the task. For some of the residents who did not have identity cards or Aadhaar, a special provision was made available in Cowin App to register them using the reference of an individual in the same colony, the CM said in his post. Home to four primitive tribes, Noolpuzha is the second largest tribal-populated local body in the state and it now flaunts cent per cent vaccination status. Out of 30,000 people of the panchayat 22.616 are above 18, of them 21,964 have already been vaccinated. Some of the inhabitants who are working in other areas have also been inoculated, a senior officer of the tribal department said. The CM had said earlier the state will a launch a massive campaign from August 9 to 31 to vaccinate maximum people. He said the Union government was asked to provide the maximum doses of vaccines as almost half of the population is not infected by the virus. The state’s low sero positivity rate is another serious concern-- around 50 per cent of the population is still susceptible to the virus, says the latest sero survey conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-tribal-village-in-kerala-s-wayanad-is-india-s-first-fully-vaccinated-hamlet-101628431690520.html

He threw a distance of 87.58m in the javelin throw event to win the gold medal.In the video, PM Modi who was then the chief minister of Gujarat, is heard lamenting the fact that despite India’s vast population, the country has struggled to win medals in the Olympics. The Prime Minister, while addressing the students of Fergusson College in Pune, pitched that newly recruited army personnel interested in sports can be trained for the Olympics.“Can a nation of 1.2 billion people not win gold in the Olympics? People often heard lamenting and asking this question every four years when the Games are played. I understand there are issues but have we taken any initiative to link (sports) to our education system? Have we given enough opportunities to our youth?” PM Modi asked the audience.“If only people in the army were given this duty, the newly recruited ones who are interested in sports if trained well can bring 5-10 medals easily,” he added. The video can also be found on PM Modi’s official YouTube channel.Social media users also referred to this video citing the Indian Army’s Mission Olympics Wing behind the success of the Indian contingent at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

08-08-2021||India||PM Modi to launch free gas connection with refill and stove ahead of UP polls||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch the second version of Ujjwala free cooking gas connection scheme along with “a free refill and a stove” on Tuesday from Mahoba district of poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, replicating the success of its first version that had earned immense political goodwill for the BJP in the 2017 UP assembly polls, two people aware of the development said.Under the Ujjwala 2.0, the Union government will distribute about 10 million gas connections this financial year to the poor along with a free refill and a stove, they said requesting anonymity. About five years ago, ahead of the crucial UP polls, PM Modi had launched the first version of the scheme (Ujjwala 1.0) in Ballia, a district in the state on May 1, 2016.Ujjwala 2.0 is also expected to give a free refill worth over ₹800 and a free stove, one of them said. “Earlier under Ujjwala 1.0, only a deposit-free LPG connection was provided to the beneficiary amounting to a financial assistance of ₹1,600, where beneficiaries also had an option to take a loan at zero interest rate from the public sector oil marketing companies for the hot plate (stove) and the first refill,” the person added.The intent of the scheme was announced in the Budget this year. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1 announced extending the scheme to 10 million new beneficiaries in 2021-22. “Ujjwala Scheme which has benefited 8 crores [80 million] households will be extended to cover 1 crores [10 million] more beneficiaries,” she said in her budget speech.Besides the free first refill and a stove along with a deposit-free gas connection, the scheme in its new form will have provision for online application. A migrant family can also get separate gas connections, the person said.“Preference would be given to poor families belonging to the scheduled castes (SCs) and scheduled tribes (STs) and also for families residing in areas with lower LPG [liquefied petroleum gas] penetration than the national or state average,” he said.Applicants will be required to fill a simplified form for know-your-customer (KYC), which would not require any notarized affidavit. Migrants can provide self- declaration if they don’t have proof of address, he said. People can apply online through the dedicated portal or common service centres CSCs, or through local gas agencies belonging to the state-run OMCs – Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), he added.Ujjwala 1.0, also known as the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) was launched in 2016 to provide only deposit-free LPG connections to the women of poor households.Initially, the target was set to provide 50 million LPG connections with the budgetary provision of ₹8,000 crore over a period of three years starting from FY 2016-17. Subsequently, considering the success of PMUY in providing access of clean cooking fuel and its resultant health, environment and economic benefits, the target was revised to 80 million connections with the total budget of ₹12,800 crore up to FY 2019-20, the second person said.The target beneficiaries were initially selected from the Socio-economic Caste Census of 2011 (SECC Data) and the scope was later expanded to more categories to include deprived women in poor households.“The target to distribute 8 crore [80 million] LPG connections under the scheme was successfully accomplished in September, 2019, seven months ahead of the target date. Implementation of PMUY has resulted in increase in national LPG coverage from 61.9% to 99.99 % as on July 1, 2021,” he said.As there has been a gap of about 18 months since the last connection under Ujjwala 1.0 was given, the petroleum ministry is using the term Ujjwala 2.0 for this phase of the scheme, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-launch-free-gas-connection-with-refill-and-stove-ahead-of-up-polls-101628428030542.html

08-08-2021||India||Centre set to launch digitized platform to benefit migrant workers||The Union government is likely to launch by next week a digitized platform for migrant workers that will enable authorities to direct state-run benefits to them and intervene during crises. The Supreme Court had, earlier, set July 31 2021 as the deadline to so do. In the summer of 2020, tens of thousands of low-paid workers fled major cities, such as Mumbai and Chennai, under traumatic conditions without much food or money following a stringent national lockdown during the first wave of coronavirus infections. These workers walked down highways to reach their native villages, exhausted. The government wasn’t able to respond with any immediate help because there was no database of who these people were. The then labour minister, Santosh Gangwar, told Parliament in September 2020 that there was no data on how many migrant workers left cities or how many died. The migrant workers’ portal is supposed to address this gap. It is a joint venture between the labour and employment ministry and common service-centres (CSC) run by the electronics and information technology ministry. The platform will allow migrants to register themselves. Registered workers will get a unique ID. The CSCs are points of access to a host of government digital services across the country. There are nearly 400,000 CSCs countrywide. The Supreme Court, while dealing with a case on the plight of unorganized workers, had on June 29 set a deadline of July 31, 2021 to “prepare a mechanism” for registration of unorganized-sector workers. Similar deadlines were issued in 2018 and 2019. Once it goes live, migrants can access the portal at the nearest CSC. “The (unique identity) number can be used to access government schemes and services, irrespective of their place of stay,” an official of the IT ministry familiar with the matter said. Workers in the informal economy are estimated to contribute nearly 50% to the country’s gross domestic product or GDP, a measure of incomes and output. “One is not clear given the humungous task of registration whether this project will be completed in the near future. The first part is registration of course,” said KR Syam Sundar, an economist with the Xaviers Labour Relations Institute, Jamshedpur. According to Sundar, the Supreme Court has been seized with “governments’ apathy in complying with critical procedural requirements concerning unorganized workers over the (past) decade and a half”. Registration of workers could take time because workers will be registered as and when they apply. “But we will launch a big awareness drive so that nobody is left behind,” a labour ministry official said, requesting anonymity. While there are no official estimates of migrant workers, a novel statistical tool developed by former chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian had revealed an annual “interstate migrant population of about 60 million and an inter-district migration as high as 80 million” between 2001 and 2011. According to the first official cited above, the portal is similar to a platform launched last month by the Gujarat government for ‘building and construction’ category workers so that they can access the state’s welfare schemes. The Gujarat portal saw a registration of over 100,000 workers within a fortnight of launch, the official said. While the unique identification number allotted to migrants will be similar to the biometric Aadhaar, Aadhaar will not be made mandatory to register on the portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-set-to-launch-digitized-platform-to-benefit-migrant-workers-101628423590133.html

The night curfew will remain in effect between 6pm and 5am.State chief secretary Dr Rajesh Kumar, also the chairman of the state executive committee of the disaster management authority, issued an order in this regard on Saturday night.“Unavoidable customary and religious rituals can be performed in open sheds by restricting the number of invitees to 20 only,” the order said. “Micro containment zones shall be strictly monitored by dedicated police department teams and health department teams.”The order stated that the fresh cases of Covid 19 infections should be isolated as soon as possible and brought to Covid care centres and the health department should arrange mobile medical teams for regular health check up. It also asked the health department to scale up the vaccination drive, contact tracing and testing by providing additional manpower, mobility support and IEC (information education and communication) advocacy.Earlier, while reviewing the complete curfew which was enforced since July 18, the state cabinet decided to adopt a micro containment zone approach in line with the Central government’s advisories to maintain a balance between the twin objectives of saving lives and livelihood through economic activities.The government also appealed to residents to adopt Covid appropriate behaviour to contain Covid-19 in Manipur.On Saturday, Manipur reported 12 Covid 19 fatalities recorded in the last 24 hours, taking the state’s Covid-19 death toll to 1,640, according to official records.The state also reported 699 new Covid 19 positive cases among the 4,941 samples tested in the preceding 24 hours, taking the infection tally to 103,588, it said.

According to an order signed by state chief secretary and SEC chairman Arun Kumar Mehta, a maximum of 25 people will be permitted to attend gatherings now. "However, this sealing will be temporarily relaxed on August 15 on account of Independence Day celebrations, subject to Covid-appropriate behaviour," the order stated.The SEC has decided to continue with various pandemic containment measures like night curfew and closure of educational institutions across the Union territory till further orders. The night curfew will be enforced in the UT everyday from 8pm to 7am. “There is a need to continue with the existing Covid containment measures in all the districts in view of the uneven trend in the daily cases,” the order read.The SEC further asked deputy commissioners to focus on Covid positivity rates, testing for coronavirus, tracking and treating of infected individuals in the medical blocks under their jurisdictions, with a renewed focus on panchayat-level mapping of cases and effective micro-containment zones in case an unusual spike in cases is noticed. “The three 'T' protocols of testing, tracking and treating, besides vaccination, need to be strengthened in these blocks. The proportion of RT-PCR tests in the total mix should be scaled up, on a best effort basis, to 70 percent or more, excluding travellers,” the order said.The deputy commissioners were directed to pay attention to implementing strict virus-control measures in closed spaces like offices, markets, malls, community halls in case the positivity rate pushes past 4 per cent.Meanwhile, district magistrates were asked to ensure compliance to Covid-appropriate behaviour by constituting joint teams of police and executive magistrates for enforcement of established norms. Those who fail to abide by the norms should be firmly dealt with, the order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-admin-relaxes-curbs-on-gatherings-for-independence-day-celebrations-101628419911434.html
08-08-2021||India||CBI arrests 5 people in a month for derogatory remarks against judges, judiciary||Two days after a bench headed by Chief Justice of India N V Ramana lamented that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and other agencies “are not helping the judiciary at all”, the agency said it has arrested five people in the last one month for allegedly posting derogatory content on social media against judges and the judiciary. The arrests have been made in an unrelated case, in which a probe was launched by the CBI in November last year on the orders of the Andhra Pradesh high court. Officials who didn’t want to be named said they have also examined a Lok Sabha member – N Suresh and a former MLA – Amanchi Krishnamohan, both belonging to YSR Congress, in the matter to unearth a larger conspiracy. The five people arrested by the premier agency include - Pattapu Aadarsh and Lavanuru Samba Siva Reddy from Andhra Pradesh (arrested on Saturday); Dhami Reddy Konda Reddy and Pamula Sudheer (arrested on July 28) and Lingareddy Rajasekhar Reddy (who was arrested on July 9 on his arrival from Kuwait). “We were monitoring Lingareddy’s movements. The moment he landed in India, the officers took him into their custody,” said one of the officers cited above. CBI spokesperson R C Joshi said – “It was alleged that the accused, by intentionally targeting the judiciary, made derogatory posts on social media platforms against judges and the judiciary, following some court verdicts delivered by the judges of the high court of Andhra Pradesh”. After registration of the case, the CBI traced 13 of the 16 accused named in the first information report (FIR) on various digital platforms, he said. Two accused are said to be based in the US while another person is also abroad somewhere, said a second officer. “We have so far examined 11 out of the 13 accused people and arrested five out of them. Evidence against the remaining six accused is being evaluated for further necessary legal action. CBI is pursuing the case to secure the presence of two other accused said to be abroad for their examination,” Joshi added. Without divulging the date, Joshi added that teams carried out searches at the premises of the accused that led to the information that one of them was allegedly using a passport in a different name. Subsequently, the CBI also got the objectionable posts removed from social media platforms. Joshi said the CBI has sought cooperation through the channels of MLAT (mutual legal assistant treaties) and the Interpol to collect evidence from abroad. The CBI had taken over 12 First Information Reports (FIRs), registered by the Andhra Pradesh Crime Investigation Division (CID) from April to July 2020 on the complaint of the Registrar General of Andhra Pradesh high court, and clubbed all these into one case. According to the CBI FIR, it was alleged in the complaint that key persons who were occupying posts of prominence in the state of Andhra Pradesh, by intentionally targeting the Hon’ble judges, made interviews/posts/speeches attributing motive, caste and corrupt allegations to some of the Supreme Court judges and high court judges in delivering orders/judgements. The CJI, on Friday, rued that judges are not on priority for investigating agencies and that their complaints are not heeded despite specialised agencies like the CBI getting roped in. “In one or two places, the court ordered a CBI inquiry. I am very sorry to say that the CBI has done nothing in more than one year. At one place, I know, the CBI has done nothing. I think we expected some changes in CBI’s attitude. But there is no change in the attitude of the CBI. I am sorry to observe this but this is the situation,” the CJI told attorney general KK Venugopal, who was called by the bench for assistance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-arrests-5-people-in-a-month-for-derogatory-remarks-against-judges-judiciary-101628419329974.html

He does not attend even marriages or other important functions in the village,” she said, referring to Chopra’s training schedule mostly keeping him away from home.Saroj added that Neeraj was a very simple and polite man but was very strict about his health and fitness. According to the family members, Neeraj worked a lot on his fitness since his childhood. They said he weighed around 90kgs at the age of 11, when his uncle took him to a gym to lose weight and fat. “In the gym, he met a javelin thrower Jaiveer from Bhinjhol village who asked him to choose Javelin throw as his sport,” said Neeraj’s uncle Bhim Chopra.Bhim said Neeraj could not speak to the family immediately after his win as he was very busy on Saturday but spoke to his father on Sunday morning over phone. “Neeraj spoke to me only for a few seconds and he was very happy and excited,” said Bhim.Neeraj’s family members and villagers are making preparations for his grand reception.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gaad-diya-papa-lath-neeraj-chopra-told-father-after-winning-olympic-gold-101628418670655.html

Many leaders like Rahul Gandhi visited the victim’s family. The BJP does not approve of the meetings and calls it a sham. A few years ago BJP, [then] as an opposition party, launched an agitation across the country after the Nirbhaya case and paralysed the Parliament holding the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s government responsible. However, today after nine years, when they are in power, they are shrugging off their responsibility by undermining the incident,” Raut said, reminding that the BJP-led Central government was responsible for law and order in Delhi.Raut was referring to a three-cornered political slugfest in Delhi over the incident between BJP, Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) led by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Raut’s party is ruling Maharashtra in an alliance with the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) after having severed ties with BJP.Raut said that BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra’s defence of the party by citing figures of atrocities against women in Congress ruled states such as Punjab, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh was off the mark. “Does that mean that BJP should condone such incidents [in states] where they are ruling just because similar incidents are happening in Congress ruled states,” questioned Raut.Raut also accused the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) of bias for having issued a notice to Twitter India for hosting a picture posted by Rahul Gandhi, in which he is with the suspected rape victim’s family. The NCPCR said the image revealed the identity of the minor’s family members violating provisions of the (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) POCSO Act and Juvenile Justice Care and Protection of Children Act.Raut also said that the Uttar Pradesh government, ruled by BJP stopped Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi from meeting the Hathras rape victim in October 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-accuses-bjp-of-double-standards-in-delhi-dalit-girl-rape-murder-case-101628410389287.html
08-08-2021||India||Covishield, Covaxin mix can give better results, says ICMR||The Indian Council of Medical Research has revealed that a mix of Covishield and Covaxin, the two main vaccines of India's Covid vaccination programme, can actually yield better results, news agency ANI reported. The study was only conducted on 18 people of Uttar Pradesh's Siddharth Nagar, who by mistake received two doses of two separate vaccines. According to the finding of the study which is yet to be peer-reviewed immunisation with a combination of an adenovirus vector platform-based vaccine, followed by inactivated whole virus vaccine was not only safe but also elicited better immunogenicity. Covishield, manufactured by Pune's Serum Institute of India, is the adenovirus vector platform-based vaccine and Covaxin, developed and manufactured by Bharat Biotech and the ICMR, is the whole virus vaccine. Covishield and Covaxin belong to two different types.The study titled ‘Serendipitous Covid-19 Vaccine-Mix in Uttar Pradesh, India: Safety and Immunogenicity Assessment of a Heterologous Regime’ has been uploaded on medRxiv. Under this study, 18 people received two doses of two different vaccines, the reaction of which was compared to 40 receipients of two doses of Covishield and 40 recipients of two doses of Covaxin, news agency PTI reported. The study duration was from May to June 2021, it said.Mixing of vaccines is being discussed globally all studies are in favour of mixing two vaccines to increase the protection against future infection. The subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation has in July recommended a trial of mixing Covishield and Covaxin, which will be conducted by the Christian Medical College in Vellore on 300 healthy volunteers.While that will be a proper clinical trial to investigate the effectiveness of the cocktail of Covishield and Covaxin, the ICMR's study was based on the goof-up that took place in May. There was no immediate adverse impact of the mix-up of the beneficiaries. Now, further study has revealed that the mix-up has actually worked in favour of protection as these people have more protection than those who have received two shots of the same vaccine.The issue of mixing vaccines is sensitive as World Health Organization has warned that individuals should not decide on mixing vaccines. Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul had earlier said that theoretically there is no problem in mixing two vaccines as the second dose in such a case will work as a booster shot. But as the government started its vaccination drive on January 16, it asked health workers to exercise extreme caution to make sure that the beneficiaries receive the second shot of the same vaccine that they received as their first shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishield-covaxin-mix-can-give-better-results-says-icmr-101628406840131.html

08-08-2021||India||'Hope I made Kalpana Chawla proud', says Sirisha Bandla||Sirisha Bandla, who dreamed of going to space as a child, finally fulfilled it last month when she visited the edge of space on board a Virgin Galactic spacecraft with billionaire Richard Branson.The 34-year-old, who is an aeronautical engineer and works at Virgin Galactic, spoke to Hindustan Times' Kumkum Chadha on 'The Interview' about her India connect and what inspired her to pursue her dreams.Bandla also talked about how her dream came true, what her family thought when she went to space and what she wants to do in the future.Here are the excerpts from the interview:'My comfort food is mom's chicken curry'Bandla said she always had this dream of going to space one day. When she visited her grandparent's house in Andhra Pradesh, she would stare at the dark night sky and wonder what lies beyond the stars."When I was around 15-16, my eyesight got pretty bad, past the requirements that were allowed for being an astronaut through Nasa. At that point, I was trying to figure out where I'd go. And around that same time, the contest happened which would award the prize money to a company that could build a reusable spacecraft that could go to space twice. Spaceship One did that. Around the same time, Richard Branson announced that he is creating Virgin Galactic which will open space access for all. I remember thinking that that's just incredible, I can still be an astronaut and I'll be working for Virgin Galactic and that's how I'm gonna get to space," she said.Bandla said she was able to get a job at Virgin Galactic and her flight to space is just a testament to the company's mission. "The company's goal is to open space access for all and fly people from different backgrounds, different geographic regions and cultures to space," she added.When asked about her Indian roots and whether she now enjoys the food in the US, Bandla said, "I do love pizza but my comfort food is my mom's chicken curry and lentil curry."So when did she start dreaming about becoming an astronaut? "I don't know where it exactly manifested. I think it started with me sitting on the roof (at my grandparents' house) and looking out at stars and wondering what's there, what's beyond Earth. I also love science fiction, so that definitely played a part. Star Trek - watching the crew of The Enterprise go into the unknown and make all these discoveries - I think that played a part. I did grow up a few in Houston, very close to the Johnson Space Centre. I was able to visit the space centre, listen to how astronauts described about being in space. All of that combined really instilled in me that I wanted to go and see it for myself."'Went to my husband's office cheering and jumping'Bandla said when she got the news that she had been chosen to go to space, she was really excited. "When I got the news, I ran to my husband's office, cheering and kinda jumping around. He actually had this in the back of his mind that I was going to share some incredible news. He has been hearing me talk about nothing else but space for years and has been so supportive of the journey. He was happy for me," she said."He has been absolutely great in supporting everything that I need to reach my dreams. I have been travelling quite a bit, and these last few weeks, he has been taking care of everything. He has been a part of my ground support crew here on my way to space," Bandla added.'Call came on weekend, I thought something was wrong at office'"When I first got the call, I assumed something went wrong at work because the call came a little bit late, and on a weekend. I picked up the phone and our president asked if I'd be interested in being part of one of the crews that's going to space. Without hesitation, I said yes. He said 'Take some time, think about it'. I said 'Okay, I've thought about it. Yes'," recalled Bandla."It was an incredible news to get and very unexpected at the time. Besides saying yes, I couldn't formulate any other words to encompass my feelings of excitement at that moment," she said further.'Weightlessness incredible experience, we were flying'Bandla said the entire crew had prepared for the launch and described how the hybrid vehicle system worked. "It consisted of an aircraft and a spacecraft. On the day of the flight, both were mated and then it took off together. We got up to about 45,000 feet, and the aircraft released the spacecraft. A few seconds later, the spacecraft started its rocket motor for about 60 seconds. And that's when we felt the booster shot. We felt around three times our weight on that boost. But it was a very comfortable ride," said Bandla."The rocket boost took us to our apogee, and once it shut off, we felt the microgravity environment. It was an environment where Gs were very close to zero. At that point, you feel like you are flying. That's when we unbuckled and were floating around the cabin. I also did a few somersaults, and carried out the science experiment which I was carrying with me. We then looked out of the window and that was really an incredible view and experience in itself," the astronaut said.She said that though the experience was surreal, it made her realise the things that she has as part of her life on Earth. "Looking at the black sky gave me a renewed appreciation of everything I'm seeing on Earth, whether it's the blue sky or the trees on my block when I am walking," said Bandla.'Kalpana Chawla was an inspiration'"I saw Kalpana Chawla's career very early. I looked at what she did to go to space and really tried to model my career. That is the reason I went to Purdue University to pursue aeronautical engineering. So I think she was an inspiration. She was one of the first people that I saw that had the same skin colour that I had and came from the same country. That kind of identity that I shared with her helped reduce mental barriers I had. I hope to do the same for young women who are thinking if they can pursue a career in aerospace," she added."I hope I have made Kalpana Chawla proud. I am sure she inspired many women, that was part of her legacy in addition to incredible technical achievements she's done at Nasa and in her career," said Bandla.Walking on the moonBandla said she really wants to walk on the moon. "Maybe go to Mars too. But I also really believe in the vision of making space available for all. It has changed my life, and I think there's a lot of other people that would like to have that same experience and may think that they do not have the opportunity. I think we're gonna see more change in perceptions when more people go into space, people that are more diverse," she said.'Hope to be a mentor'Bandla also talked about the under-representation of women in the field of space research. She said that just about a 100 women have actually gone to space "and the number of women of colour is even less". The 34-year-old said that she wants to change the situation and be a mentor to women who actually dream about going to space. "The way I got through it was having mentors, especially women that are in the field and have gone through a lot of what I have gone through. I hope to be that mentor for a lot of women. It's one of the biggest piece of advices I give to women - find yourself a mentor."On future missionsBandla said that one of the objectives of the Virgin Galactic mission was to study how future space expeditions can be carried out efficiently. Speaking about the comment of Nasa's Bhavya Lal about finding clean clothes to lessen the burden of space ships, Bandla said these are the issues the entire industry is looking to tackle. "There are a lot of problems that we need to address before we go to farther destinations. Laundry is definitely one of them."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sirisha-bandla-on-her-space-sojourn-india-connect-and-astronaut-dream-101628313299549.html
08-08-2021||India||Why India-UK flight tickets have become so costly||A round trip between New Delhi and London by Air India in general cost somewhere between ₹55,000 to ₹70,000, but the prices skyrocketed just before August 8, the day the UK moves India from the Red list to the Amber list, and thus allowing Indian travellers to visit London. Airfares between India and the UK rose up to ₹4 lakh, as senior IAS officer Sanjeev Gupta pointed out on Twitter on Saturday. Not only Air India, Vistara, British Airways fares in August are also as high as over a lakh.As Air India clarified that its current fare for the Delhi London sector is around ₹1.15 lakh, it was found out that the application programming interface from airlines being consumed by travel portals is fetching the fare of business class in case economy class is not available. But ₹1.2 lakh for a one-way, direct flight is exorbitant.What has led to the price rise?The pent-up demand for travel is being seen as the primary reason for the fare to skyrocket. The UK government placed India under its Red list barring Indians from travelling to the UK in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic in India. Now that India has been moved to the Amber list, Indians are allowed to travel to the UK but will have to follow the home quarantine guidelines even if they are fully vaccinated as neither Covishield nor Covaxin is recognised by the UK authorities. But the relaxation will now ensure that students and professionals can now travel to the UK and can quarantine at home or in any place of their stay.The relaxation has come just at the time when a huge traffic is expected in the Delhi-London line because of the admission session.The airlines do not have an unlimited quota of flights between the UK and India which has pushed the demand. As of now, there are 30 flights permitted between India and the UK per week. Once more flights are added, the situation may ease. From August 18, Air India will operate direct service between Heathrow and Kochi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-india-uk-airfare-has-skyrocketed-as-embargo-on-indian-flyers-got-lifted-101628400111753.html

Till now, manure and other products made of cow dung worth ₹5 crore have been sold to help the women of the district. Online sale, which started a few days ago, has sold products worth ₹1 lakh so far. The aim is to further increase makers' profits by expanding the market leading to increase in production. The online sale has increased in the last few days,” said Taran Prakash Sinha, collector Rajnandgaon.The collector added that around 365 Gauthans or cowsheds are engaged in this work using 66,400 quintals of cow dung procured by the administration under a state government scheme this year.Chhattisgarh had earlier initiated a scheme called ‘Godhan Nyay Yojana’, to buy cow dung from dairy farmers at ₹2 per kg to offer them financial support.“Till now, 53,000 quintals of vermicompost worth ₹1.5 crore, made by women self help groups, have been sold. Earlier, manure was being sold only at the cowsheds, but now it is selling online on platforms such as Amazon due to the increasing demand for manure from other states as well. So far, orders worth lakhs of rupees have been received from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, West Bengal and other states,” the collector said.Mehtareen Yadav, a woman engaged in Jai Maa Vaishnavi Swayam Sahayata Samuh- a self help group, claimed to have earned ₹8,000 by selling cow dung made products in the last 6 months.“I have been told that the administration is selling our cow dung products online now.

On Saturday, Bengaluru reported 357 fresh Covid-19 infections, which was a slight decrease from Friday's number of 441 new infections. Bengaluru's daily rise in Covid-19 infection remains higher than that of Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata.According to the latest Covid bulletin, there are 162 micro-containment zones in the city including over 100 apartments and individual homes being sealed. The number is on the higher side as the civic body has tweaked the rules for containment so that maximum alertness can be exercised in a short period of time. According to the earlier regulations, a micro-containment zone was declared when over 10 Covid-19 cases were reported in an area. Now the number has been reduced to 3.Bengaluru's Mahadevpura has the highest number of micro-containment zones, followed by the east zone.Districts bordering Kerala are on high alert as several fresh infection cases have been reported in the state, which apparently came from Kerala. 100 nursing students from two colleges in Karnataka's Hassan, 182 kilometres from Bengaluru, tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday. They were tested after 21 nursing students from Kerala who came to Hassan for an examination were found positive.Bengaluru civic authorities have already tightened restrictions in the city so that this fresh rise seen in the districts does not affect Bengaluru's graph. The R-value in the city is already above 1 which means every 100 infected people in the city are spreading the virus to more than 100 people.Bengaluru Police have imposed Section 144 in the city which bars the assembly of four or more people, which will remain in place till August 16. The night curfew which was from 10pm to 5am has also been extended and it will now start at 9pm. The night curfew timing is for the entire state while some districts will also observe weekend lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-has-162-containment-zones-sees-slow-but-steady-rise-in-covid-cases-101628391538433.html
08-08-2021||India||Unofficial economic blockade of Mizoram ends following Assam’s intervention||Hundreds of trucks carrying essential items to Mizoram, stranded in Assam for over 10 days following a deadly clash over a border dispute between the two sides that resulted in death of 6 Assam cops and one civilian, finally started moving after two Assam ministers convinced the locals to let them go, ending the undeclared economic blockade of Mizoram since the July 26 clash.Several rounds of talks between the local administration of the two states had failed to end the impasse, which was finally lifted after the guardian minister of Cachar district Ashok Singhal and forest minister Parimal Suklabaidya arrived at Lailapur border area on Saturday evening and spoke with the locals, who were refusing to let the trucks pass through Assam.Some vehicles that attempted to move before the deadlock was resolved were vandalised by a group of locals, who pelted them with stones before Cachar superintendent of police (SP) Ramandeep Kaur and officer in charge of Dholai Police Station Shahabuddin rushed to calm them down. However, the horrified truck drivers instantly took a U-turn and started returning towards Silchar.“We cannot forget the killing of 6 Assam police officers so easily. We have suffered enough and we want a permanent solution. We have seen several tweets from both governments talking about peace, but on the ground, nothing has changed. Mizoram did not withdraw its forces from Assam’s land and no action has been taken against the Mizoram cops who killed our cops. We are not against anyone but are demanding justice. We don’t understand why our government didn’t bother talking to us before allowing the vehicles to go,” one of the agitated locals said.It took more than two hours for the ministers and the police officers to convince the locals to allow the vehicles into Mizoram’s territory.“Considering the situation in Mizoram, chief minister Himanta Biswa Sharma asked us to go to the border and make transportation normal. People in Assam are angry and pained because Mizoram police have killed six Assam police officials. But respecting the decision taken by the Assam chief minister, locals allowed the vehicle to move,” Ashok Singhal said.The ministers also appealed to the Mizoram government to take strict action against policemen allegedly responsible for the killing of Assam cops. “We have already appealed to the government of Mizoram to take appropriate action against the police officers responsible for the firing that day. People in Assam are emotional and both the governments have to take necessary steps to convince the people so that they do not rebel.”Assam minister of excise, forest & environment and fisheries, Parimal Suklabaidya said, “ We want justice and if required we will move the Supreme Court of India against this. But as the big brother of Mizoram, we need to make some efforts to bring peace between the two states.”Two ministers, one each from Assam and Mizoram locked horns on Twitter on Saturday evening blaming each other. Mizoram’s minister of state Robert Romawia Royte tweeted saying, “Mizoram bound vehicles & innocent people escorted out from Silchar MZ house by @assampolice were mobbed and vandalised at Lailapur, Assam. Where were the policemen escorting them? Is this another deadly drama?”Ashok Singhal replied saying, “The trucks’ movement started at 9.04 pm today and this tweet is posted at 9.05 pm. What are your intentions dear Minister @robertroyte. Why are you creating hatred among people and derailing the process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unofficial-economic-blockade-of-mizoram-ends-following-assam-s-intervention-101628391248102.html
08-08-2021||India||States tighten Covid-19 curbs in view of surge in cases. All you need to know||With a renewed surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in certain parts of India, multiple states have tightened their respective pandemic-necessitated restrictions. While Karnataka has imposed renewed curbs on the movement of people travelling to the state from Kerala, the existing coronavirus lockdown in Tamil Nadu has been extended by two more weeks.Here's a brief rundown on some of the renewed restrictions imposed across India, with an eye on a potential third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic:Tamil NaduThe Covid-19 lockdown in Tamil Nadu was extended for two more weeks till August 23. The MK Stalin-led state government has proposed to resume physical classes for school students of standards 9 to 11 from September 1. There is also a provision to allow the re-opening of medical colleges in the state from August 16, according to reports.Thermal screening and sanitisation before entering commercial establishments have been made mandatory.KeralaStarting from August 5 (last Thursday), all commercial establishments in Kerala were allowed to operate from 7am to 9pm, from Monday to Saturday. However, not everyone can enter those establishments; only those who have received at least the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, or those who have a negative RT-PCR test report (not more than 72 hours old), or are in possession of Covid-19 positive results more than a month old will be allowed to enter.Shopping alls will function solely for online delivery. Social distancing will be mandatory in religious places and while travelling in public transport.KarnatakaKarnataka has imposed strict restrictions on the movement of people from Kerala, with an eye on the potential third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the inflow of people crossing the state border on foot or on two-wheelers remained unhindered. Following this, earthmovers were deployed at specific border areas to dig up the road so people from bordering villages and bikers cannot cross over.Bengaluru has imposed Section 144 (curfew) till August 16; meanwhile, the existing night curfew will also remain imposed in the area. As many as 12 check posts have been set up along the Kerala-Karnataka border, where people coming in from Kerala are being admitted only after they show a negative RT-PCR test report.MaharashtraMaharashtra issued a fresh 'Break the chain' order earlier this week on Monday, under which the Level-3 restrictions remain effective in 11 districts, including Pune.Religious places, cinema halls, multiplexes, and theatres will still remain closed. The movement of people in the state will also be restricted from 9pm to 5am, according to the new orders. The ban on birthday celebrations, political, social, and cultural events will continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-tighten-covid-19-curbs-in-view-of-surge-in-cases-all-you-need-to-know-101628387567877.html
08-08-2021||India||Abhishek Banerjee to rush to Tripura after alleged attack on youth TMC leaders||Trinamool Congress (TMC) national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee said he is rushing to Tripura on Sunday following an alleged attack on the party’s youth front leaders by workers of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday. Three TMC youth leaders, Debangshu Bhattacharya, Sudip Raha and Jaya Dutta, who were visiting Tripura to prepare for assembly polls in 2023 and pose a challenge to the BJP, alleged that their cars were stopped and attacked on Ambassa Road. They also alleged that shots were fired and a TMC office was vandalised at Dharmanagar, Tripura’s second biggest town after Agartala. The alleged attack took place five days after Abhishek Banerjee was shown black flags in Tripura and a BJP worker hit his car with a bamboo stick. Banerjee went to Agartala after employees of I-Pac, the company formed by election strategist Prashant Kishor, were stopped by the local police from leaving their hotel. The BJP denied the allegations on Saturday while the Tripura unit of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the main opposition force in the state, issued a statement condemning the alleged attack. While Raha and Dutta alleged that they suffered injuries in the face and head, Bhattacharya posted videos on social media that purportedly showed stones being thrown by some youth and a few others who appeared to be wearing uniforms similar to the police. “The attacks took place in the presence of the police. Is there no rule of law in BJP-ruled Tripura?” Bhattacharya said in one of the videos. BJP leaders in Tripura and Bengal rubbished the allegations, dubbing the alleged attack as staged. “TMC believes in the politics of violence. Why will anybody want to hurt TMC leaders in Tripura where they have no significance? This is a drama to draw media attention,” said Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh. “Anybody can come to Tripura to see how the government is performing and replicate the model in Bengal. The BJP was not involved in any attack,” Nabendu Bhattacharya, a BJP leader from Tripura, told a Bengali news channel in Bengal. Abhishek Banerjee reacted on twitter and posted photos of the youth TMC leaders. “The GOONS of @BJP4Tripura have shown their TRUE COLOURS! This barbaric attack on Trinamool workers reveals the ‘GOONDA RAJ’ in #Tripura under @BjpBiplab’s Govt.! Your threats and attacks only prove your inhumanity. DO WHAT YOU CAN.. Trinamool will not budge an INCH!” Banerjee said in his first tweet. In the second tweet he wrote on Saturday night, Banerjee tagged Tripura chief minister Biplab Deb and wrote, “Tomorrow, I am coming to #Tripura to stand by every Trinamool worker who were (sic) brutally attacked by @BJP4Tripura goons today. It is my promise that I shall continue fighting till the very last drop of my blood. STOP ME IF YOU CAN @BjpBiplab! #TripuraDeservesBetter.” On August 3, the BJP alleged that two of its workers were murdered in Bengal by members of TMC a day after Banerjee, while on a day-long trip to Tripura, posted a video showing BJP workers shouting slogans against him and a man hitting his car with a bamboo stick. Although Samik Bhattacharya,the Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson said on August 2 that the attack was uncalled for and BJP workers were not involved in it, the issue snowballed when Udayan Guha, a senior TMC leader from Dinhata in north Bengal’s Cooch Behar district, wrote on his Facebook page that BJP workers and leaders in Dinhata would be “well taken care of” after what happened in Tripura. On Saturday, Guha made a similar statement at a party meeting in Cooch Behar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/abhishek-banerjee-to-rush-to-tripura-after-alleged-attack-on-youth-tmc-leaders-101628388847894.html

They allegedly conducted roughly 100,000 fake tests during Mahakumbh. All three firms have been booked under the Indian Penal Code, disaster management act and epidemic diseases act.The owners of Max Corporate Services, Sharad Pant and his wife Mallika Pant, had earlier sought protection from the Uttarakhand high court from arrest.“After the period of court’s protection ended on August 4, two police teams left for Delhi and Nainital to arrest the accused couple.“Their last phone location was traced to Noida on Friday noon, but after that their mobile phones are switched off,” an SIT officer, aware of the developments, said on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kumbh-fake-testing-sit-sends-teams-to-nab-lab-owners-101628387814203.html

All vaccines, including Pfizer, Moderna, Sputnik V, Oxford-AstraZeneca earlier claimed to be effective against Delta. Several studies have been conducted in this regard. This week, the Indian Council of Medical Research has come up with their findings of Covishield and Covaxin, the two main vaccines being administered in India.Here is what they foundAn ICMR study recently revealed Bharat Biotech's Covaxin is effective against Delta Plus, a mutation of the Delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is driving the resurgent wave of the pandemic across the world. Delta Plus was first detected in India in April 2021 and since it is a variant of Delta, it was classified as a variant of concern. This variant has been found in several other countries.The ICMR study found that the variant, to some extent, neutralised antibody titer in vaccinated individuals but that will not be detrimental for the vaccination programme. Covaxin is effective against Delta Plus, the ICMR study revealed.A similar study conducted by ICMR on Covishield revealed that Covid-19 recovered individuals with both doses of Covishield have higher immunity against the Delta variant. The vaccine induces a robust hormonal and cellular immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, it has been found.These are real-life studies conducted on people vaccinated either partially or fully.Breakthrough cases where vaccinated people got infected have also been examined in these studies. Delta was considered responsible for the peak of the second wave of the pandemic. The present spike of Covid-19 cases in some states is also attributed to Delta. However, experts have said that the variant alone can not be the reason for a third wave of the pandemic in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-and-covishield-against-delta-delta-plus-what-recent-studies-revealed-101628383361196.html

Here's what it means for travellers||The United Kingdom has announced that it is moving India, which was so far on its high-alert 'red list' for entering England, to the medium-risk 'amber list' from today (i.e. August 8, Sunday). According to foreign travel advice issued by the Government of UK, the changes came into effect from 4am on Sunday, August 8. This means that people travelling from India to the UK will have a relatively easier time than before, with fully vaccinated passengers no longer obligated to adhere to the 10-day hotel quarantine rule.Also Read | UK, Spain, UAE: Countries that have eased travel restrictions for IndiansHere's what the new changes mean for travellers flying to the United Kingdom from India:UK's traffic light systemThe United Kingdom incorporates a 'traffic light' system for international travel, under which there are separate coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-related rules and protocols for each of the coloured lists, classifying zones according to the risk they pose:Red listWhen a certain country is on the United Kingdom's 'red list' (like India was till now), passengers from that country cannot freely travel to England. Only British and Irish nationals, or those who hold residency rights in the United Kingdom, are allowed to enter the country from places on the red list. Moreover, British citizens are also advised to not travel to countries on the red list.In the context of quarantine rules, passengers travelling to England from any of the red-listed countries are required to go under quarantine at a hotel for 10 days and take a total of three Covid-19 tests, which includes one before departure from the origin country.Most of India's neighbours, with the exception of Bhutan, are on the United Kingdom's 'red list' for travel. This includes Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.Amber listCountries on UK's 'amber list' (where India has presently moved to) are categorised as medium-risk zones and passengers can find it relatively easier, as far as travel guidelines are concerned. Although entering England from the amber-listed countries still require a passenger to take three Covid-19 tests in total, the hotel quarantine rule is not mandatory.Passengers from India, which is now on the amber list, can now quarantine at home or a place of their choice for 10 days after arriving in the UK. They will retain the option to 'Test to Release' after five days of quarantine.For passengers from amber-listed countries, the first coronavirus test must be taken at least three days prior to departure. The second is to be taken on the day of arrival or before the second day of stay. The third must be taken on or after the eighth day of stay in the UK, according to the official foreign travel advice. If the said passenger is a UK national, they are also not required to take the eighth-day Covid-19 test.India and Bhutan are currently on the United Kindom's 'amber list' for travel.Green listThere is another category in the United Kingdom's traffic light system for international travel -- the 'green list'. As is apparent from the name, this includes countries in zones that the Government of UK considers relatively the safest in terms of travel amid the Covid-19 situation.Passengers travelling from green-listed countries to England have to take a total of two coronavirus tests. The first one must be taken before entering the UK, while the second has to be taken on before the second day of arrival. The passenger will be asked to undergo quarantine only if the Covid-19 test result returns positive.Click here to read complete instructions and foreign travel advice on the Government of UK's official website for passengers from India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-moves-to-uk-s-amber-list-today-here-s-what-it-means-for-travellers-101628379855608.html

A nationwide lockdown was implemented on March 24 to curb the spread of the virus.“During the lockdown, people weren’t able to go and get themselves tested. There was also a lot of fear of exposure to the virus, because of which no one wanted to go to the hospital. Even our staff had faced problems in reaching the centre and the daily testing was reduced,” Dr KK Chopra, director of New Delhi TB Centre, said.Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) is the mainstay of the TB programme where medicines are given under the supervision of a healthcare worker at the health centre. However, during the pandemic, patients were given medicines for one month together to help them continue with their treatment and teleconsultations were held to ensure compliance.All DOTS centres were allowed to give medicines to patients from other states or areas who were stranded in various places during the lockdown. Non-governmental organisations were also roped in to deliver medicines to those who were unable to visit the centres.“We also collaborated with private medical practitioners to collect sputum samples from patients for testing. We were much better prepared during the second wave and are also well-equipped in case of any surge in Covid cases in the future,” Dr Chopra said, adding that more TB cases were gradually reported towards the latter half of 2020.“Covid-19 is an acute infection and there is a lot of fear in people too, prompting them to visit hospitals each time they experience any of the symptoms. People usually do not do that with TB which is chronic. Cross referral of patients from TB and Covid-19 clinics actually helped in detecting more cases,” he said.A drop in TB cases was reported also because out-patient clinics remained shut during and even after the lockdown. “The impact of Covid-19 was seen not only on TB but other diseases as well; the out patient departments or OPDs had stopped running for months together,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.Experts fear that the undiagnosed cases of TB could facilitate the spread of the infection, but wearing of masks by a majority of the population might have an unintended but pleasant impact.“TB is a droplet infection so people wearing masks will prevent the spread of the infection. The current dip in numbers is not because of that – the incubation period of TB is longer – but we will see an impact in the future,” Dr Khilnani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/25-dip-in-tb-cases-in-2020-experts-cite-low-screening-amid-lockdown-101628378557456.html

Addressing party workers and later interacting with the media Singh said, “JD-U will no longer be sitting in the hope of allies. The party will fight on its own and try to expand further.” In a statement which is seen as a message to its alliance partner, the BJP, which of late has been sending vibes that it has made Nitish Kumar the CM despite a smaller number of MLAs, Singh said, “If other parties want to partner with us then it is fine. Otherwise, we will fight on our own. And we will win. Look at Arunachal. In the last assembly elections, we fielded candidates on 15 seats and won on seven.” Singh also spelt out his party plan. “We aim to make JD-U a national party and expand further. I’ve held discussions with party leaders in Manipur and UP. We’ll hold discussions with NDA partners. If they don’t make us a partner in these states, we will fight and win the elections alone,” said Singh and added “That is why our party got recognition in Arunachal. Similarly, gradually we will field candidates in other states. Our target is to get recognition in two more states and then get recognized as a national party.” The party national executive held recently had also passed a resolution in New Delhi and expressed its willingness to contest the UP assembly polls in alliance with BJP provided it gets a respectable number of seats or else it would contest independently on no less than 200 seats. The Munger MP also asked party workers to take to the public the work of Nitish Kumar in the last 15 years. “I will also talk to the state president and district president in this regard. The main point of the work done in the department should be conveyed to the public. For this a booklet has also been printed. Now only they should keep taking it to the public. The Chief Minister’s message will reach every household,” he said. Singh also met Chief Minister Nitish Kumar at his residence on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jdu-will-not-sit-idle-waiting-for-allies-will-contest-on-its-own-lalan-singh-101628364727762.html
08-08-2021||India||Former Odisha hockey player languishes in poverty as country celebrates bronze win||The bronze-winning performance of the Indian men’s hockey team at the Tokyo Olympics has certainly rekindled popular interest in hockey, but a 26-year-old former full-back from Odisha who once represented the state in senior national men’s championship has been working as a migrant labourer to make ends meet.Playing for Gangpur-Odisha hockey team (one of the associate teams of Hockey India) in 2013 and 2014 senior men’s hockey championship, Santosh Majhi, a tribal from Lulkidihi village of Sundargarh district stood like a rock defending his team’s goals from the marauding forwards of the opponent teams. But 7 years later, Majhi’s world is far removed from the world of hockey as he migrated to Goa last year to work in fishing vessels for ₹6000 a month.“I have no other alternative than to go out to work. I have no future left in hockey though I would have loved to play,” said Majhi from his home in Lulkidihi village that has produced at least two Olympians Deepgrace Ekka of the women’s hockey team and former Olympian Ignace Tirkey. With at least 7 international players, Lulkidihi is considered as the nursery of hockey in Odisha along with Saunamara village from where former captain of the Indian hockey team, Dilip Tirkey hails.Like most tribal children in Sundargarh district, Majhi took to hockey at the age of 11 when he joined the sports hostel at Panposh. For his daily wage earner father, sports promised a getaway from the drudgeries of life. In the hostel he shone as a defender and played for the Hockey Gangpur team in 2013 and 2014. After leaving the sports hostel in 2015, he played for Paradip Port Trust in All India Major Ports Hockey Championships in 2016, 2017 and 2018, but could not get a job there.Majhi said in 2016, he had tried for a job in the Indian Army through the sports quota, but was disqualified during the medical test over a varicose veins issue. His problems have also been compounded as he could not complete his higher secondary exam in 2016 after suffering a fracture in his hand.Arun Kumar Sahu, a social activist of the area, said it is disturbing to see players like Majhi struggle for a living. “While the state government and the Centre are spending crores for hockey, it would be good to rehabilitate players like him,” said Sahu.Odisha sports secretary Vineel Krishna said though Majhi represented Gangpur Odisha in senior nationals, he did not secure any position. “Though the state government has a policy of giving government jobs to all medallists, He is not eligible for a job as per the notification of the home department,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-odisha-hockey-player-languishes-in-poverty-as-country-celebrates-bronze-win-101628363289767.html
08-08-2021||India||Understanding TN’s resistance to NEET||This September 12, M Chatriyan will be proceeding towards his fourth attempt at the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), a uniform annual entrance examination to gain entry into India’s undergraduate medical courses in the government and private colleges. His desire to become a doctor has kept him trying consistently despite his family’s meagre means to afford such time and expense. This isn’t uncommon in Tamil Nadu, which has one of the highest medical aspirants and doctors in the country. Following a Supreme Court ruling, the NEET became a reality in 2017 in the state. Since then, the state has tried to exempt itself from the exam through an ordinance, inside court halls and negotiations with the Union government, and civil society protests spilt over to the streets, but nothing has worked. Now the state has renewed its fight to be exempted once again since the DMK government took over in May this year. The new government constituted a committee, chaired by Justice A K Rajan, to study the adverse impact of NEET on socially and economically backward students. After submitting the report to chief minister M K Stalin on July 14, Rajan said that a majority among the 86,343 stakeholders in the exercise were against NEET. And the government, as promised in its election manifesto, is working to annul NEET by introducing legislation and obtaining the consent of President Ram Nath Kovind. The staunch resistance to NEET originated from the plight of disadvantaged students like Chatriyan from Tamil Nadu’s hinterlands, who have to compete with urban and affluent students across the country with more access to resources to crack the exam. Like any other exam, NEET is marred by the tragedy of students dying by suicide. Chatriyan is a Dalit student, who hails from the Ariyalur district, which lags in development, and people depend on agriculture and work in cement factories. His family, too, engaged in cashew business from agricultural lands, but after plunging into debt, his parents became coolies when he was a child. A few months after completing his board exams in 2018, in his first attempt, he scored only 99 out of 720. “I didn’t know the answers to questions in NEET,” says Chatriyan. “We didn’t know what to study for the exam. We had no reference books. The school teachers didn’t have any knowledge about the exam, either.” He says that he was misinformed by his friends, who also wrote NEET, that even if they passed theycould get admissions given the quota for SC/ST. The cut off for SC/ST category in NEET is 42% or 147-113 score range. Chatriyan had qualified with minimum marks but it wasn’t enough for admission. This was the case in his two subsequent attempts, but he improved each time scoring 216 and 265. Commercialisation of NEET Only one among Chatriyan’s five friends cleared NEET. That friend lived and learnt at a private institute for a year which helped him get into a private medical college in Coimbatore. Private coaching institutes charge anywhere between ₹2.5 lakh and ₹5 lakh for a single year and some offer crash courses. Tamil Nadu began offering free coaching to government and government-aided school students to prepare for NEET. Last year more than 25,000 students enrolled in this online due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Rajan panel is yet to make its report public but it has noted the turnover of all private coaching centres put together in Tamil Nadu. “It’s a big business but this isn’t solely because of NEET,” a panel member said on condition of anonymity. “Even if NEET isn’t there, these centres will be coaching for some other exam.” According to the Tamil Nadu government’s data submitted to the Madras high court in 2019, only 2.1% who got admitted to all medical colleges that year didn’t have private coaching. Out of this only, 1.5% entered into government medical colleges. Merit or Injustice? Before NEET, Tamil Nadu considered the class 12 board exam as a parameter for admissions to medical colleges. In 2018, Tamil Nadu revised its erstwhile basic state board syllabus and began introducing updated textbooks. An analysis of the NEET question paper, which covers Biology, Chemistry and Physics as multiple choice questions with negative marking, showed that 97% of the questions in 2020 were covered in the updated textbooks. Educationist Jayprakash Gandhi was initially an advocate for NEET and over the years its functioning made him question its purpose. “Before NEET came in, Tamil Nadu students who joined MBBS with just class 12 scores had outperformed other states in the NEET postgraduate (PG) exams. This shows that the argument that NEET produces better quality doctors is false,” says Gandhi. “More than 70% of those writing NEET (UG) are repeaters.” The state has a doctor for every 253 people, a ratio, which is on par with Scandinavian countries and above norms of the WHO. One in eight doctors from India is from Tamil Nadu, based on data from the Medical Council of India provided by former union health minister Harsh Vardhan in the Parliament in 2019. Combined with the social justice politics of the Dravidian movement, the state established educational institutions in every district and its 69% caste-based reservation system made education accessible to its various sections. With a 51.4% gross enrollment ratio (students enrolling in higher education) in 2019-2020, Tamil Nadu is twice the national average (27.1%), and has also surpassed Nation Education Policy’s target of 50% enrollment by 2030. While there was no Common Entrance Test (CET) when professional courses were introduced in Tamil Nadu, a government order in May 1984 established CET for medicine, engineering, agriculture, etc. In 2006, Tamil Nadu appointed a committee to study its impact, based on which the state abolished the CET as it favoured city students who could access private coaching. The same argument has been repeated with NEET. Former health minister and physician in the MG Ramachandran (MGR) cabinet Dr K V Hande is in support of the exam and says it requires the right coaching. “In my view, when the entire country is going in one direction, why should Tamil Nadu be going in a different direction?” asks the 94-year-old. He says if he were the health minister now he would open multiple coaching centres with one in each taluk. Tamil Nadu government presently has 400-odd coaching centres across the state. Suicides Chatriyan lives 10km away from the village of another Dalit teenager, who died by suicide in 2017 after failing in NEET, though she was a school topper with 98%. The girl’s death led to widespread protests across Tamil Nadu. Since then, the word NEET became a symbolised evil and she became the face of the struggle against the exam. Similarly, another student from Ariyalur died by suicide in 2020 after failing to clear NEET twice. More than a dozen students have died by suicide across the state either due to fear of taking the exam or failing the exam. The politics It was in 2010, under the UPA 2 when the country’s medical education regulator the Medical Council of India amended regulations to make way for NEET. It was meant to roll out by 2021 but nationwide protests from states such as Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh delayed the implementation until 2016. Successive chief ministers M Karunanidhi and J Jayalalithaa opposed NEET. It’s in one of the few issues where the two warring Dravidian parties concur. Since there is no data from the NTA on the configurations of medical college admissions, different sections share different data to argue their stance. Dr Ezhilan, Naganathan a physician and DMK MLA from Chennai filed a range of RTIs related to NEET through which he says they found that before 2017, 90% of students who got into government medical colleges were from government schools, government-aided schools or small, private schools showing that the previous admissions method offered opportunities for the most marginalised students to become doctors. The BJP, which is the only party in Tamil Nadu that is pro-NEET, paints a different picture. Only 100 students from government schools got admissions into MBBS for ten years (2007-2017) before NEET, says state BJP general secretary Karu Nagarajan from RTIs and surveys they have collated which Ezhilan says is incomplete information. “It is NEET that’s supporting government students,” Nagarajan defends. Their alliance leader the AIADMK last year during its regime introduced a 7.5% horizontal reservation in medical colleges for government school students who clear NEET. This ensured that government school students got 405 seats in the 2020-2021 academic year as opposed to six seats earlier. “Before NEET poor students were being cheated because those who could afford paid up to a crore under the management quota,” Nagarajan says. Senior advocate and DMK MP P Wilson is confident that the state can avail an exemption within legal provisions. He uses the example of jallikattu (bull-taming traditional sport in Tamil Nadu) which was banned under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 by the Supreme Court but Tamil Nadu brought in an ordinance to allow the sport and the President gave his assent in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/understanding-tn-s-resistance-to-neet-101628361669649.html
08-08-2021||India||NIA raids 7 K’taka locations over 2020 B’luru riots case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Saturday conducted searches in seven locations in Karnataka as part of the investigations into the attacks on the two police stations in Bengaluru’s DJ Halli and KG Halli in August 2020. “Today (07.08.2021), NIA conducted simultaneous searches at 7 locations in Bengaluru City, Karnataka. Searches were conducted at premises of seven absconding charge-sheeted accused persons in RC-34/2020/NIA/DLI and RC-35/2020/NIA/DLI,” read an official statement. During the searches, various incriminating documents and electronic devices were seized from the premises of the absconding accused persons, read the statement. On June 16, the Karnataka High Court granted default bail to 115 people arrested in the case, while keeping on hold a trial court’s order extending the time to complete the investigation by another 90 days, saying it was legally unsustainable. The NIA, after it could not complete the probe within the stipulated 90 days, had filed an application in the trial court for an extension under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), 1967. The trial court allowed extension of further 90 days in November last year and the applications filed by petitioners for default bail were rejected in January this year. Subsequently, Pasha and other accused moved the high court. The HC noted that the application filed by the prosecution requesting an extension of time for completion of the investigation, without notifying the accused, would frustrate their indefeasible right for statutory bail. The riots were triggered by a Facebook post by Naveen P, nephew of Congress MLA R Akhanda Srinivas Murthy from Pulakeshinagar constituency. On August 11 last year, a mob gathered in DJ Halli and KG Halli areas after police sought time to take action over a complaint filed against the post, which was termed derogatory to Muslims, as per the police complaint filed on August 11. Pasha, an accused in the case, had approached the DJ Halli police station with this complaint against Naveen at 7.45 pm on August 11. The attacks began at 9.30 pm and ended in the early hours of August 12 after MLAs and other senior leaders gathered at the spot, according to the FIR. Four people were killed in the riots, according to police. Police filed 68 FIRs in this case. In two FIRs, they invoked sections 15 and 16 (punishment for terrorist activity), section 18 (conspiracy to commit a terrorist act) and section 20 (being members of a terrorist organisation) of the UAPA. This was the largest number of people ever charged under the UAPA for a single incident of violence in Karnataka. The Bengaluru Police slapped the stringiest charges against the accused just days after a fact-finding committee, led by Bharatiya Janata Party leader Aravind Lambavalli, demanded an investigation by NIA. The central agency then took over the investigation into the case on September 11, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-raids-7-k-taka-locations-over-2020-b-luru-riots-case-101628361667882.html

The state also reported 139 new deaths, taking the total fatalities to 17,654. “Going by the case trajectory it will take two more weeks for cases to subside in the state,” said medical expert Dr N M Arun.The situation is complex in some of the densely-populated districts like Malappuram, where the average TPR is above 15 per cent. The state is also witnessing a spate of suicides, majority of small-time traders and farmers. Desperation is quite visible as cases continue to rise and many say the government’s packages are cosmetic in nature. “My kidney and liver are intact. They are up for sale,” a street vendor put up a board recently in Thiruvananthapuram while a bus owner pasted a notice on his stationary bus that it is for sale for scrap in Kozhikkode -- such scenes are not rare in Kerala these days. In the last two months, the state witnessed more than 30 suicides during the Covid-19 pandemic. ‘On sale’ boards before shops are a regular sight. Two days ago, the government was forced to re-look its pandemic control measures as cases went up manifold. But these measures aggravated the situation than solving any, ground situation shows. “How long do we have to suffer like this? is the most heard question in markets, tourist spots and other places. And nobody has any answer to offer. According to the new regulation, shoppers and employees at shops and malls will have to flaunt their Covid-19 vaccination certificates and many agitated traders have threatened to close down their establishments. “We can’t remain lax now. We have taken strict measures in view of a possible third wave,” said state health minister Veena Geroge justifying recent regulations. “We expected a soothing balm from the government but we got enough brickbats. Many traders have committed suicide. If the situation remains like this, you can count more,” said merchants association leader T Nasaruddin, blaming the government. “The government is not pragmatic in its approach. It goes by the advice rendered by bureaucrats. Its ears are not on the ground,” said opposition leader V D Satheesan, criticising the government’s knee-jerk reactions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20k-new-cases-raises-concerns-in-kerala-101628361666735.html
08-08-2021||India||Yediyurappa’s cabinet-rank facilities, perks to remain: govt||Hours after allowing 18 ministers from the previous government to retain their portfolios, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Saturday ordered that the former chief minister BS Yediyurappa will receive all facilities at par with Cabinet-rank ministers.According to a notification from the Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms (DPAR), these perks will be applicable till the time chief minister Basavaraj Bommai is in office. As per the current protocols, apart from the salaries, a cabinet minister is entitled to a sumptuary allowance of ₹3 lakh per year, house rent of ₹1 lakh per month, fuel allowance for up to 1,000 liters per year, ₹10 lakh for purchase of furniture, vehicle facility with a limit of ₹21 lakh, free telephone connection at home and office among other things. Officials in the know of the developments said that following this notification, Yediyurappa will continue to live in Cauvery, the official residence of the Karnataka chief minister. “Congress-JD(S) government too had tried to give Cabinet-rank status to former chief minister Siddaramaiah. In Siddaramaiah’s case, the coalition government could not do it because it would be a conflict of interest since he was heading that committee (in 2018-19). Despite this, they let him stay in Cauvery. In the case of Yediyurappa ji, there is no such conflict of interest, since he is not holding any other office profit,” said senior BJP office-bearer. A congress spokesperson said that the BJP’s decision to provide cabinet rank to Yediyurappa is a waste of taxpayer’s money. “In their attempt to settle internal party politics, they are wasting taxpayers’ money. When he isn’t part of the cabinet why are they spending lakhs of rupees on him,” asked the spokesperson, who didn’t want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yediyurappas-cabinet-rank-facilities-perks-to-remain-govt-101628361606030.html
08-08-2021||India||India approves J&J’s single-dose vaccine||India has granted Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose Covid-19 vaccine emergency use authorisation, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said on Saturday, making it the fifth vaccine and the second foreign-made shot to be cleared for use in the country.The pharmaceutical company, however, said it was too early to give a delivery timeline for the vaccine. It said earlier on Friday that it applied for emergency use approval. The vaccine will be brought to India through a supply agreement with homegrown vaccine maker Biological E Ltd, J&J has said.“India expands its vaccine basket! Johnson and Johnson’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine is given approval for Emergency Use in India. Now India has 5 EUA vaccines. This will further boost our nation’s collective fight against #COVID19,” the Union health minister tweeted on Saturday.Apart from the J&J vaccine, the four other Covid-19 shots approved for emergency use in India are Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, the Russian-made Sputnik V, and the Moderna vaccine.“While we look forward to meeting our delivery commitments, it is premature for us to speculate on the timing of our vaccine deliveries,” the company told Reuters.The J&J vaccine, which has shown 66-72% efficacy in different trials, has been approved by regulators in the US, UK, Europe and the World Health Organization. The company in May applied for a permission to carry out bridging trials – smaller clinical trials that are meant to assess if the findings are similar to larger trials carried out elsewhere. But it withdrew the request last week and filed for emergency approval directly, making use of a change in policy in India that allows coronavirus vaccine makers to do so if they have received approvals by certain regulators around the world.In a statement issued on Saturday, the American pharma major said: “We are pleased to announce that on 7th August 2021, the Government of India issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 single-dose vaccine in India, to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 18 years of age and older.”“This decision was based on topline efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE clinical trial, which demonstrated our single-shot vaccine was 85 percent effective in preventing severe disease across all regions studied, and showed protection against COVID-19 related hospitalization and death, beginning 28 days after vaccination. This is an important step forward in accelerating availability of our COVID-19 vaccine to help end the pandemic,” the company said.The company applied for the grant of emergency use authorisation to the central drugs standard control organisation (CDSCO) on Thursday.“On 5th August 2021 Johnson & Johnson Pvt. Ltd applied for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of its single-dose COVID-19 vaccine to the Government of India. This is an important milestone that paves the way to bringing our single-dose COVID-19 vaccine to the people of India, and the rest of the world, through a collaboration with Biological E. Limited,” the company’s India spokesperson said on Friday.The vaccine is developed by the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, to prevent the viral infection in individuals 18 years of age and older.Experts have welcomed the approval.“Yes, single dose vaccine works better; we may need a booster later, but it’s a great addition,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, the country’s senior vaccine expert, from Christian Medical College, Vellore (Tamil Nadu).In April this year, the government announced that Covid-19 vaccines cleared for use in western countries and Japan will get fast-track approval in India, throwing open the market for possible imports of Pfizer, Moderna and J&J doses.The accelerated approval applies to doses authorised by the US’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) Japan or by WHO.The US FDA authorised J&J vaccine for emergency use in February 2021.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-approves-j-j-s-single-dose-vaccine-101628361485430.html
08-08-2021||India||Key report on climate crisis may issue stark warnings||A key document on the state of the climate is on Monday expected to issue stark warnings to world leaders about the climate crisis and its consequences, experts said, in a development that comes after hundreds of scientists and government representatives reviewed the report.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will release its ‘Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis’ report on Monday. The 40-page IPCC report, which has been thoroughly reviewed by hundreds of experts, scientists and representatives of 195 governments, including India, has emerged as one of the most significant documents informing political leaders on the state of climate ahead of the UN climate negotiations (COP26) in November.The report is expected to provide the most updated physical understanding of climate crisis impacts – how and why climate has changed, whether it is caused due to human influence; future scenarios like how quickly we are likely to breach the 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C thresholds, and what that would mean in terms of extreme weather events such as floods, sea-level rise, and glacial retreat, particularly in the Arctic. The findings will be crucial for India because IPCC will, for the first time, provide a localised outlook, with maps, atlas and others.Over the last couple of monsoon months, India has been facing severe impacts of the climate crisis,including devastating floods in the Konkan region, a spate of cloudbursts and floods in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, and nearly 100 deaths due to lightning incidents.IPCC was established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1988 to provide political leaders with periodic scientific assessments concerning climate change, its implications and risks. This time, the IPCC findings will be significant on two counts, according to experts.One is that climate models and statistical methods have improved greatly in the past few years since IPCC’s fifth assessment report in 2014. “The present assessment report (sixth assessment) is based on much improved climate models and also using more observed and paleoclimatic data. Therefore, future projections of the climate could be considered to have reduced uncertainty,” said M Rajeevan, former secretary, ministry of earth sciences. So, we are likely to see more “high confidence” assessments in the report giving people a very realistic picture of how climate change will impact lives.The second reason is because it is widely understood now by the scientific community that we are very close to breaching the 1.5 degrees C global warming threshold. According to highlights of the Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update by the UK’s Met Office and WMO released in May, there is a 40% chance of the annual average global temperature temporarily reaching the tipping point of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels during the next five years. The findings of the report prompted Petteri Taalas, the WMO secretary general, to warn the world is getting “measurably and inexorably” closer to that threshold.But, nationally determined contributions made by countries are currently woefully short of meeting the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 degree C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5 degree C.According to United Nations Environment Programme’s Emissions Gap Report 2020, the world is heading for a temperature rise of over 3 degree C this century. The ambition of various nationally determined contributions (NDCs) will have to be tripled to meet the 2 degree C target and increased by at least 5 times to meet the 1.5 degree C goal and that current pledges under the Paris Agreement are inadequate and could only limit global temperature rise to 3.2 degree C, the report had warned.“The climate plans submitted by more than 90 countries so far will reduce only 2.3 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. What we need is ten times that emission reduction, otherwise our planet will warm by more than 1.5 degree Celsius. IPCC science warns us that even small degrees of average warming can lead to more heatwaves, floods, cyclones, and sea level rise,” said Ulka Kelkar, director of the climate programme at the World Resources Institute.“One of the key takeaways from this report will be whether the mitigation strategies submitted by nations through the Paris Agreement are sufficient to keep the global temperature rise within the 1.5°C or 2°C limits or not. Based on the current commitments and emission scenario, it does not seem so. We have better data and higher resolution climate models since AR5, and they indicate that we might break the 1.5°C limit in the current decade or next and the 2°C during 2040–2060,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, climate scientist, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-report-on-climate-crisis-may-issue-stark-warnings-101628360167734.html

One policeman was injured in the attack & attained martyrdom. Area has been cordoned off,” Kashmir police said in a Twitter post.The deceased, identified as police constable Nisar Ahmad, succumbed to injuries while being taken to the hospital, said the official.The attack evoked strong condemnation from political leaders, with J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha terming it a “cowardly’’. “I strongly condemn the cowardly attack on the security force in Kulgam in which our brave police jawan, Nisar Ah Wagay attained martyrdom. Terrorists will never succeed in their nefarious designs, those responsible for such heinous acts shall be brought to justice,” he said.Peoples Democratic Party chief Mehbooba Mufti, too, expressed her grief in a Twitter post. “Deeply saddened to hear about the policeman shot dead by militants in Kulgam today. Condolences to his family & may his soul rest in peace,” she said.Ahead of the Independence Day on August 15, the Valley has recorded a spurt in terrorist attacks.On August 5, a grenade blast took place in Old City Srinagar; two days after a cop and a civilian were injured in a suspected terrorist attack in the same area.On June 22, Inspector Pervaiz Ahmad, who worked with the Criminal Investigation Department wing of police, was killed in a terrorist attack near his residence in Nowgam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-constable-killed-in-kulgam-terror-attack-101628360048123.html

Until then, he will stay connected with you all through his other SM platforms & continue to raise his voice for our people & fight for their cause. Jai Hind,” the Congress’ official handle posted on Twitter. It, however, clarified later that the account was temporarily locked.“He (Gandhi) was not able to post on his page since morning,” said a Congress functionary familiar with the matter. “That is why the message was put out from the Congress party’s handle,” the functionary added, asking not to be named.According to Twitter, the account was never “suspended” as such an action would entail making the account inaccessible across the globe. HT reached out to the company to check whether the account was temporarily “locked” but did not immediately receive a response. The social media company has a range of enforcement polices for content that violates its terms of service or in response to a properly scoped request from an authorised entity in a country.Saturday’s development came after the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) asked the Delhi Police and Twitter on Wednesday to take action against the leader over a photograph he posted after meeting the family of a nine-year-old girl who was killed after allegedly being raped.The child rights body said the Twitter post violated the Juvenile Justice Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. Gandhi met the girl’s family on Wednesday and assured his support. “Parents’ tears are saying only one thing – their daughter, the daughter of this country, deserves justice. And I am with them on this path to justice,” Gandhi tweeted in Hindi and posted the photo of his meeting with the girl’s relatives. Twitter has restricted the post from public view.According to Twitter’s enforcement page, it can restrict a person who has violated Twitter rules from posting until the tweet in question is deleted. “When we determine that a Tweet violated the Twitter Rules, we require the violator to remove it before they can Tweet again. We send an email notification to the violator identifying the Tweet(s) in violation and which policies have been violated. They will then need to go through the process of removing the violating Tweet or appealing our review if they believe we made an error,” the enforcement page says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-alleges-rahul-s-twitter-account-temporarily-suspended-firm-denies-101628359865988.html

A peaceful and stable Afghanistan requires that the rights and interests of all sections of society are promoted and protected,” Jaishankar added.Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla also met Al-Qahtani and discussed the Doha peace process on Afghanistan and “concerns over the deteriorating security situation”, according to a tweet from external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi.Joint secretary JP Singh of the external affairs ministry’s Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran (PAI) desk was also present at the meeting between Shringla and Al-Qahtani, who has played a key role in the Afghan peace process. Singh is the external affairs ministry’s pointperson for Afghanistan and had held a separate meeting with Al-Qahtani on Friday.The security situation in Afghanistan has rapidly deteriorated in the wake of the Taliban shifting their violent attacks from rural areas to key cities and provincial capitals such as Herat, Kandahar, Lashkargah, Zaranj and Sheberghan.Since Friday, the Taliban have reportedly captured Zaranj, the capital of Nimroz province that borders Iran, and Sheberghan, the capital of Jawzjan province.The US and the UK have asked their citizens in Afghanistan to leave the country because of the worsening security situation. The embassies of the two countries issued alerts asking their nationals to leave on commercial flights.“If you are still in Afghanistan, you are advised to leave now by commercial means because of the worsening security situation,” said the alert from the British embassy.The US embassy urged Americans to leave Afghanistan immediately, adding that the mission’s ability to assist US citizens is “extremely limited even within Kabul”.Al-Qahtani travelled to India before two key meetings to be held in Doha next week on the situation in Afghanistan. Russia has convened a meeting of the “extended troika”, which includes China, the US and Pakistan, on August 11, while Qatar will host another meeting between the Afghan side and its regional and international partners.The world community is looking to these meetings to help revive the Afghan peace process, which has been stalled for several months as the Taliban have shown no inclination to resume peace negotiations with the Afghan government.In June, Al-Qahtani had confirmed that Indian officials were engaged in talks with the Taliban – a development first reported by Hindustan Times. He told a webinar at the time that he believed the Indian side is engaging the Taliban as the group is seen as a “key component” in any future government in Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deterioration-in-security-situation-in-afghanistan-is-serious-says-jaishankar-101628338024551.html
08-08-2021||India||Income Tax dept launches dedicated emails for taxpayers’ grievances||The Central government has created three dedicated email addresses for income taxpayers to register grievances related to faceless tax assessment, penalty and appeals, the Income-Tax (I-T) department said on Saturday.The three email addresses are samadhan.faceless.assessment@incometax.gov.in; samadhan.faceless.penalty@incometax.gov.in; and samadhan.faceless.appeal@incometax.gov.in, it said.The move is aimed to further improve services in alignment with the taxpayers’ charter, the department said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had released India’s first charter of taxpayers’ rights and duties on August 13, 2020 ahead of the 74th Independence Day.Launching the ‘Honouring the Honest’ platform on August 13 last year, PM Modi said: “This platform consists of major reforms such as faceless assessment, faceless appeal and taxpayers’ charters. The faceless assessment and the taxpayers’ charter have been implemented from today, while the facility for faceless appeal will be available to the people of the country from 25 September, which is the birth anniversary of Deen Dayal Upadhyay ji.”Meeting the objectives of the charter, the I-T department adopted technology-driven faceless schemes to make tax administration transparent and to end overreach by officials.The faceless tax processing system was first proposed by the Prime Minister in 2017 and received a mention in the first budget tabled by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 5, 2019. The system enables a random selection of tax cases through artificial Intelligence and machine learning, with reduced discretion of tax officials.The objective of faceless assessment is to completely eliminate physical contact between the taxpayer and the taxman to make tax administration objective, transparent and corruption-free.The faceless appeal was launched by the government on September 25, 2020 to eliminate discretionary powers of the taxman, curb corrupt practices and provide ease of compliance to taxpayers. Under the new system, I-T appeals are being finalised in a faceless manner with the exception of appeals relating to serious frauds, major tax evasion, search matters, international tax issues and matters pertaining to the black money.After implementing faceless assessment and faceless appeal systems on income-tax matters, the government also set up a National Faceless Penalty Centre (NeAC) to have an unbiased and transparent digital faceless mechanism for imposing penalties on tax defaulters. The system provides adequate opportunity to income tax payers to be heard and also have provisions for review on legal and technical grounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/income-tax-department-launches-dedicated-emails-for-taxpayers-grievances-101628326144042.html
08-08-2021||India||Bombay high court rejects Raj Kundra’s plea against arrest, police remand||The Bombay High Court on Saturday rejected the pleas, filed by actor Shilpa Shetty’s businessman husband Raj Kundra and his associate Ryan Thorpe, challenging their arrest and police remand in the case of alleged production and publishing of pornographic content.Kundra was arrested on July 19 and Thorpe, who was employed as the head of department of Information Technology in Kundra’s firm, was arrested on July 20. They are currently in judicial custody.In his petition, Kundra contended that his arrest was illegal as the mandatory provision of issuing notice under Section 41A of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) was not followed. He said a number of people were arrested in connection with the pornographic content case and later released on bail before the crime branch officials searched his office on July 19. His petition said he was called by the police to their Byculla office on the pretext of recording a statement but was arrested instead.The petition stated that not only was Section 41A of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) violated by not issuing a notice but the magistrate court also ignored his application opposing his “unlawful” detention by sending him to police remand till July 23.The petition further stated that despite the Supreme Court’s order against arresting and detaining persons accused of offences with punishment of less than seven years due to the Covid situation, the magistrate failed to take cognisance of the highest court’s order and remanded him to custody.Kundra’s petition demanded that the police remand order should be quashed and he should be released.However, taking note of the prosecution’s allegation that the duo had tried to destroy evidence, justice AS Gadkari said the petitioners did not deserve any relief at this point. The court also upheld the magistrate’s decision to remand them in police custody twice.On July 20, Mumbai Police said that Kundra and 10 others had been arrested for alleged involvement in the creation of porn films and publishing them through mobile apps. Mumbai Police Commissioner Hemant Nagrale then claimed that Kundra seemed to be the key conspirator and there was sufficient evidence corroborating that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-high-court-rejects-raj-kundra-s-plea-against-arrest-remand-in-porn-case-101628317383379.html

08-08-2021||Today's||The limits of the subjudice rule||The Union government, as reported by this newspaper on Friday, has said that since the Pegasus issue is before the Supreme Court (SC), the matter is subjudice and, therefore, a question on it ought to be disallowed in Parliament. This principle is also being used to block a discussion on the issue in the House. It is another matter that when a discussion on the issue was first demanded, the issue was not before the court.Res subjudice is a legal term which, in simple language, means that if a matter is before a court, the same matter cannot be brought before another court by the same parties. This rule is contained in section 10 of the civil procedure code. The purpose of the rule is to prevent contradictory orders on the same issue being issued by two different courts. Various rulings by courts, however, indicate that this rule is not invoked liberally while admitting suits.The subjudice rule has found a place in the rules of the Houses of Parliament and also the state legislatures. This rule prohibits the admission of motions, resolutions and questions for discussion in the House on the ground that the matter is before the court. But it is not applicable to bills or an issue of privilege. The point is that the rule does not have universal application to all types of business of the legislature.When the rule of subjudice was incorporated in the House Rules, the rule-makers had taken a rather strict view of this, and did not want a discussion in the House to influence the proceedings in the court in any way. But, over a period of time, the legislature gradually changed its approach to the rule.The problem it encountered was that the moment an issue was brought before the court, the legislature would find itself unable to discuss it, howsoever important it may be from the point of view of public interest. A legislative House, which is the highest representative body of the people, could not be placed in such a helpless situation.The legislature began finding ways around it. In 1955, Lok Sabha (LS) Speaker GV Mavlankar, while dealing with a subjudice matter with regard to the prize competition bill, 1955, said that what the House would discuss would be different from the point the court might deal with. Mavlankar said: “Whatever law might have been discussed there, in the appellate judgment or the first court’s judgment or if going to be discussed before the Supreme Court is not the point which we are going to discuss here at all.”But as the issue persisted, in 1967, the then LS Speaker appointed a committee under VS Page, chairman, Maharashtra Legislative Council, to examine the scope of rule of subjudice in a legislature and suggest guidelines to be followed in the application of this rule.An important recommendation of this committee was that the “freedom of speech is a primary right whereas the rule of subjudice is a self-imposed restriction, so, where need be, the latter must give way to the former”. Thus, the primacy of the freedom of speech of members of the legislature was recognised as against the restriction imposed by the rule of subjudice.In 1968, the LS Speaker explained the approach to be adopted in the application of this rule. He said, “While on the one hand the chair has to ensure that no discussion in the House should prejudice the course of justice, the chair has also to see that the House is not debarred from discussing an urgent matter of public importance on the ground that a similar, allied or linked matter is before the court of law.” The main concern among legislators was that the House should not be hobbled by undue restriction imposed on its freedom to discuss matters of great public interest.As a matter of fact, the rule of subjudice was introduced in the rules of the legislature as a matter of caution. The legislature wanted to avoid a situation where a debate on a subject in the House may influence the court, which may impair the fairness and objectivity of a judicial decision. But there has been no evidence so far to prove that this has happened. On numerous occasions, Parliament has discussed issues which were before SC. Major financial scams were debated by the Houses although they were before the court. Thus, the freedom of the House to discuss all issues of public importance was accorded primacy.Further, the rules of procedure contain a rule which empowers the House to suspend any rule to facilitate a discussion. The rule of subjudice can also be suspended, if need be. This underscores the fact that the rule of subjudice is not immutable or inviolable. Since it has been imposed by the members on themselves, it can be changed when there is an urgent necessity to do so.Parliament should be able to debate all issues of public importance. If the rule of subjudice is rigorously followed, any person can stymie a debate in the House by just filing a case on the subject in any court in the country. Therefore, the plea of subjudice need not be stretched to absurd lengths.PDT Achary has served as secretary-general, Lok SabhaThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-limits-of-the-subjudice-rule-101628429650441.html
08-08-2021||Today's||Restoring governance and normalcy in J&K||In Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), on August 5, the second anniversary of the effective abrogation of Article 370, nothing of the kind that separatists were expecting happened. To be sure, there were some protests. But rallies with the Tricolour were also held at various locations across the Valley. This was unimaginable in the past, for these were the same spots where Pakistan’s flag used to be visible and its national anthem could be heard.Though shops did not open in the old markets on August 5, was it a symbol of mukhalifat (resistance), fear or doubt? On a recent visit to the Valley, two weeks before the August 5 anniversary, I met a man who was trembling on his numb legs and moving with the help of a stick. He said that he was returning home after shopping in the evening, and it was getting dark. “Suddenly two people stopped me and asked, ‘Is your name…?” I said yes. As soon as they heard me, one of them hit me on the back of my neck. When I fell down, one of them asked me, ‘Did you vote?’ I said yes. He drew a pistol. I begged for mercy, but he could not be dithered. I was shot in the legs and they disappeared.” I asked him if the attackers were caught. He said that since they had covered their faces, he couldn’t recognise them.The victim said that he had visited several leaders for help, but no one had listened. He then went to the authorities, and got an assistance of ₹75,000 and a promise of job for his brother in the police.While he preferred to remain anonymous, the man’s story can answer questions about today’s Kashmir. The terrorists wanted to make him a moving pamphlet against Indian democracy but they failed miserably. After casting his vote, without being distracted by threats, he is now fighting for his rights under the Indian Constitution. His story tells us that how Kashmir is changing now, after going through all the ups and downs. The painful stories of common people don’t go unheard anymore. The victim told me, in detail, how bureaucratic decisions and attitudes under previous governments, run by two political dynasties, were contingent on whether they would be of personal gain and loss to the chief minister. Later, explaining this lack of grievance redressal in the past, J&K’s Lieutenant-Governor, Manoj Sinha, said that there used to be two types of Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs) — one of the people, and the other of the collector. The district administration used to do what collector’s MLA wanted. It was this political-bureaucratic nexus that led the Valley to misery.During the visit, I also met a top intelligence official who said terrorists nurtured by Pakistan could be divided into three categories. “The first are those who carry guns and regularly announce on social media that they are mujahideen. Second, those who are partly involved in terrorism due to unemployment or as a pastime. These are the people who carry out grenades or other small attacks. There is another category, those who use social media to provoke the masses” He added that it was those from the second and third categories who were more dangerous. “They live a normal life but pursue the attitude of a terrorist. No one knows their deeds, that is why the neighbours support them when they are raided…It is difficult to overcome their duplicity, but we are on the right track.”Pakistan wants at least 200 armed terrorists to be active in the Valley and the police are still looking for around 180 of these. But this does not mean that terrorism is still as widely prevalent. The empowerment of the J&K Police has increased its ability to communicate with the villagers. And security forces are able to nab most youths even before they become trouble.According to Inspector-General of Police Vijay Kumar, 1,394 incidents of stone-pelting were recorded between August 2017 and July 2019, which dropped to 382 in the next year. In those two years, 27 civilians and four security personnel were killed. In the last year, this figure has reached zero. Similarly, there has been a significant decline in terrorist incidents.Is that enough? No, there are more problems in the Valley. The separatist sentiments have been fed by the syllabus of primary schools and madrasas in Kashmir. A new syllabus is being implemented from August to reverse this. At the same time, a list of teachers, state workers, and officials with a separatist attitude or those who are nurturing terrorists has also been compiled. So far, action has been taken against more than 100 people.Despite all these efforts, it will take some time to win the trust of the masses in the Valley. There are many wounds on the hearts and minds of this land and its descendants, which need to be healed with the efforts of the government.Shashi Shekhar is the editor in chief of HindustanThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/restoring-governance-and-normalcy-in-jk-101628429290718.html
08-08-2021||Editorials||Tokyo 2020: A new era begins||India has an Olympic track and field gold. In itself, that is breathtaking. But Tokyo 2020 has been a landmark Games for India in more than one way. Even the medal tally — India’s best ever with seven — doesn’t do justice to the breakthroughs India’s athletes have made, the number of medal contenders India had, and those who opened new routes. So, along with Neeraj Chopra, Mirabai Chanu, Lovlina Borgohain, Ravi Dahiya, PV Sindhu, Bajrang Punia and the men’s hockey team — all champions — it is important to remember others. Bhavani Devi, the first fencer from India to compete at the Olympics; Nethra Kumanan, the first Indian woman sailor to qualify for the Games; Aditi Ashok, who, in a star-studded field of the world’s best women golfers, missed out on a podium finish by one shot; or the Indian women’s hockey squad who made a giant leap that almost took them to a medal. All these names suggest two heartening trends. One, it symbolises a welcome shift where women are overcoming social obstacles to shine. Two, it highlights the difference that proper training in the right kind of environment makes. India’s sport governing bodies have done well to step back from seeking to control every aspect of an athlete’s career and allowing them the freedom to choose their coaches and training bases. The federations must now build a wide base for their sport by creating infrastructure, but of the right kind, and giving access to the maximum number of young people possible. Devi almost gave up on fencing because in India, the sport has almost no presence. This is understandable— fencing’s cultural roots lie in Europe and it is expensive. But what about running tracks? Astroturfs? Wrestling mats? Punching bags? Javelins?Neeraj Chopra, a truly gifted athlete who has made the nation proud, also got lucky in some ways. He was spotted early, at 16, by a great coach; he had time to build on the fundamentals, and was then carefully nurtured by a succession of great coaches. Most athletes in most sports in India don’t get that care till they have already reached an elite level of performance. But as challenges persist, there is little doubt that India’s success at Tokyo is both visible — in terms of the medals — and invisible — in terms of progress across disciplines. The stage is set for Paris and beyond.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/tokyo-2020-a-new-era-begins-101628429237243.html
08-08-2021||Editorials||There will be more floods. Be prepared||The number of people exposed to floods worldwide has increased by almost a quarter over the last two decades, according to an analysis of satellite-based data by Columbia University’s Earth Institute. The report, published in Nature last week, has three main findings. One, nearly 86 million people, driven by economic necessity, moved to flood-prone regions between 2000 and 2015. Two, the majority of flood-prone countries are in South and Southeast Asia, but satellite data showed previously unidentified increases in exposure across Latin America and West Asia. Three, most flood events were caused by excess rainfall, followed by storm surges, snow or ice melt, and dam breaks.Floods happen due to both heavier than normal rainfall, and the limited capacity of rivers, drainage and water harvesting structures to withstand and discharge excess rainwater. The climate crisis is causing substantial disruptions in monsoon patterns, and scientists warn that floods will only become more frequent and powerful. To minimise loss, planners need to combine traditional knowledge (which saw floods as a natural process one had to find ways to live with), robust data, and innovative strategies.Conventionally, hard infrastructural solutions — such as embankments and dams — have been popular to reduce the impact of flooding. But there is now a shift towards nature-based solutions due to their co-benefits. For example, while mangroves protect coasts, they also support fisheries and food security, and act as a carbon sink. Cities are also trying out new methods such as developing a network of small- to medium-sized green areas, which can absorb and store excess water, and porous pavements to tackle urban flooding. To reduce the impact of flooding, it is also critical to go back to basic practices: Plant more trees, restore water bodies, improve soil cover with plants, and stop destroying and encroaching on the floodplains of rivers. India needs to pay heed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/there-will-be-more-floods-be-prepared-101628429111319.html
