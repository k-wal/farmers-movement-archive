09-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Foreign national held with drugs worth ₹7 crore||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Sunday intercepted a foreign national at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) who had allegedly swallowed capsules containing drugs worth at least ₹7 crore to deliver it in Mumbai. The suspect is connected to an international drug cartel. He was admitted to Sir JJ Hospital and after conducting medical procedure around 50 capsules of narcotics have been retrieved from his abdomen, said zonal director Sameer Wankhede of the NCB. As per the medical reports, there are more capsules inside the suspect’s abdomen and a medical process is underway to retrieve those capsules. The suspect came via Qatar and he is currently under medical observation. “He seems to be carrying multiple drugs, but mostly appears cocaine and heroin. It will be confirmed after the test,” added Wankhede. “In such cases, during preliminary inquiry, we offer them food, and if they refuse, our suspicion gets fortified. The X-ray and CT scan tests were carried out in this case, following a court order,” said an NCB officer. This is an old modus operandi, mostly used by smugglers to avoid being caught at airports. The drug supplier does not eat anything because the movement in the abdomen could rupture the capsules, leading to death, added the officer. In a similar case, the NCB had arrested a Nigerian national outside a five-star hotel at Juhu in January, this year, and allegedly recovered 10-12 cocaine-filled capsules from his mouth. The suspect used to carry a bracket in his mouth where he hid the capsules filled with cocaine and then waited outside five-star hotels for customers, an NCB officer said. In 2013, in another similar case, the Air Intelligence Unit (AIU) of Mumbai customs had arrested two Tanzanian nationals at Mumbai airport for allegedly smuggling cocaine by ingesting capsules. One of them died on the way to hospital after the capsules exploded inside his abdomen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-foreign-national-held-with-drugs-worth-7-crore-101628533636865.html
09-08-2021||Mumbai||CM Uddhav Thackeray takes stock as fresh Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra dip to 174-day low||Maharashtra on Monday recorded its lowest one-day spike in Covid-19 cases in nearly six months (174 days) as it added 4,505 fresh infections, taking its tally to 6,357,833. The state had reported 3,663 cases on February 16. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray met the state’s Covid-19 task-force members to deliberate over further relaxations, including opening up malls, cinema halls, auditoriums, places of worship, and increased operational hours for restaurants and eateries. Besides that, CM discussed preparations for a possible third wave. The active case count in the state stood at 68,375 on Monday. The state also reported 68 deaths, pushing the toll to 134,064. Mumbai added 218 new cases, taking city’s tally to 737,715. Mumbai added three fatalities, pushing its toll to 15,954, and active cases were 4,599 on Monday. Thackeray took stock of the Covid-19 situation and sought a view from experts on further unlocking in restrictions, senior officials said. Last week, minister Aaditya Thackeray had hinted that not just local trains, the state will look at easing curbs for people, who have taken both jabs, in other activities as well. A statement from the Chief Minister’s Office said, “In the task force meeting, discussions were held on the possible third wave, the requirement of oxygen, increasing the pace of vaccination, boosting testing-tracking as well as on how to ease restrictions in the coming days, while maintaining caution, in other sectors.” The task force has been directed to prepare rules based on the instructions given by the CM, the statement added. A decision on further easing of relaxations are expected this week.An official said, “The task force has recommended caution as reopening now could hasten the third wave. The relaxations, if they are announced next, will be for double-vaccinated people in the first phase. The idea is to postpone the reopening of all activities for everybody. At the same time, they have recommended speeding up the vaccination drive.”A task-force member said that there was a discussion on whether malls should be allowed to reopen only after all the mall employees have been fully vaccinated. “Besides that, for extending restaurant timings, it was suggested that the staff should be fully vaccinated at the earliest,” said the member who attended the meeting.Meanwhile, state health department officials have partially attributed the decrease in daily numbers to lower tests. In the last 24 hours, the state tested 157,175 samples and had a positivity rate of 2.86%. State health department officials said as the tests have gone down by around 40,000 owing to the weekend, the number of cases have dipped correspondingly.Maharashtra is seeing a dip in emergence of Covid-19 cases on a weekly basis between May and August. As per the data analysed, the dip in state’s cases between May and June was 75.88%, while it dipped by 35.35% between June and July. Between July and August, it saw a decrease of 28.32%.Maharashtra added 95,108 fresh cases between June 1 and June 7, which dropped to 61,489 between July 1 and 7-- drop of 35%. Mumbai on the other hand saw a dip of 33.34% during the same period as it added 4,056 new cases between July 1 and 7. In the first seven days of August, the state added 44,075 new infections, while Mumbai added 2718, a drop of 28.32% and 32.99%, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/uddhav-takes-stock-as-fresh-covid-19-cases-in-maharashtra-dip-to-174-day-low-101628533580104.html

In its order of July 29, 2021, the apex consumer court held the bank guilty of providing deficient service and said the consumer was entitled to refund of the amount deposited by him, penalty paid to the tax authorities, travelling expenses incurred on account of his visits to the income tax offices, cost of litigation and in addition, compensation for the physical and mental harassment undergone.The case dates back to the income tax assessment year 2007-2008 , when Santosh Kumar Sethi, a resident of Noida, deposited ₹13,880 at one of the branches of Punjab National Bank towards advance tax, to be remitted to the tax authorities. The amount however was never deposited with the income tax, resulting in Sethi being asked by the tax authorities to pay penalty. First, in response to Sethi’s complaints in 2012, the bank alleged that it was not allowed to credit the amount by the tax authorities. Subsequently, to his repeated letters in 2012 and 2013, the bank insisted that the amount had been deposited with the income tax, but hinted that there could be some error in the assessment year in the challan and advised him to have it corrected. Consequently, Sethi travelled to Deoghar (where he was being assessed) and Dhanbad, Jharkhand, to meet the assessing authority and the income tax commissioner respectively, but was told that the amount had not been deposited at all. In 2014, after he got a demand notice from the tax authorities, the bank informed Sethi,, in response to an RTI query, that the amount had been deposited, but there was a clerical error on its part in the assessment year in the challan! While upholding the order of the Delhi District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, awarding ₹50,000 as compensation and ₹10,000 as costs of litigation, the apex consumer court pointed out that the bank had not provided any evidence in support of its claim that it had paid the amount to the tax authorities. On the other hand, the consumer had placed on record the letter of the Income Tax Commissioner dated September 18, 2014, stating that the money had not been deposited by the bank. (Santosh Kumar Sethi Vs Punjab National Bank, RP NO 1172 of 2017)The apex consumer court thus held the bank liable for the consequences of its failure to deposit the tax amount. However, I must point out that even if the bank had made the deposit, it would still be guilty of negligence for making a mistake, as per its admission, in the assessment year in the challan! Because first and foremost, when the consumer deposited the advance tax to be credited to the income tax authorities, the bank was duty bound to credit the amount without any mistakes. Failure to do so constituted deficiency. Next, having committed that error, the bank should have borne in mind its consequences and immediately informed the customer of it. Failure to do so was also sheer negligence. Third, the bank should have immediately made the effort to rectify the mistake in the assessment year made by it. It did not do that.Fourth, if for any reason the bank could not make the necessary corrections, it should have again informed the customer and made a fresh deposit, at its cost, after getting the customer’s approval. Or, it should have informed the customer of its failure to make the correction, refunded the amount along with consequent damages. In other words, the bank could easily have made amends for its mistake and ensured that the customer was not put to unnecessary harassment and made to pay penalty. It did not do any of those things, despite repeated letters from a distressed customer.Lastly, to an honest tax payer, any accusation of having evaded payment of tax would not only come as a shock, but also cause utmost anguish. The bank should have been sensitive to that. Thus the bank failed on many fronts and in fact it should have paid a bigger price for its negligence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/negligence-on-part-of-banks-may-prove-costly-to-customers-101628533036281.html
09-08-2021||Other||Make sure you give correct details for buying insurance policy||Whenever you buy an insurance policy, make sure that you do not misrepresent facts, as that could really jeopardize your claim and cause you immense financial loss. A recent decision of the consumer court, upholding the repudiation of a claim pertaining to a motor vehicle insurance, drives home this point really hard. The central point in this case was the rejection of a claim made by Vinod Kumar, a resident of Mysore, following an accident involving his vehicle- a Volkswagon Jetta, on September 16, 2014. Purchased in 2012, the vehicle was insured with Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company from January 8, 2014 to January 8, 2015. Kumar had paid ₹30,003 towards the premiumIn response to Kumar’s complaint before the consumer court, the insurance company argued that the policy was vitiated on account of the policyholder giving false information at the time of purchasing the policy. The insurer’s case was that the policy holder had claimed that the car was insured the previous year with Reliance General Insurance and that he was entitled to a 20 per cent discount as ‘No Claim Bonus’ (NCB). However, the cheque issued by the consumer to Reliance General Insurance the previous year had been dishonoured and so the insurer had not issued the policy at all. Thus he neither had a vehicle policy the previous year nor was he entitled to NCB. So on grounds of misrepresentation and suppression of material facts, the policy stood vitiated and the insurer was not liable to indemnify the loss.The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission agreed with the lower consumer courts’ view that the insurer was justified in not honouring the claim. Quoting the Supreme court in Life Insurance Corporation of India Vs. Smt. Asha Goel, and Reliance Life Insurance Co Vs. Rekhaben Nareshbhai Rathod , the Commission said there was no illegality in upholding the repudiation of the claim .(Vinod Kumar Vs Manager, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company, RP No 2277 of 2019, decided on August 4, 2021)Thus the consumer not only lost the huge premium he had paid towards the insurance, but also the insurance money for repairing the car. On the other hand, if he had spoken the truth, he may not have got the 20 per cent discount on the premium, but his policy would be intact and the insurer would have had no ground for rejection of his claim.Consumers may not be aware that in case of lapse of motor vehicle policy by even one day, the vehicle has to be inspected by the insurer before issuing a policy. And even if the policy holder has not made any claim previously, if a comprehensive policy is allowed to lapse for over 90 days, the accrued benefit of ‘No Claims Bonus’ is lost. In other words, if you have a good NCB to your credit, it is important to ensure that there is no break in your vehicle insurance.So always pay your premium on time , preferably through an electronic payment mode and ensure that the policy is issued immediately. Under the Motor Vehicles Act, you cannot take your vehicle on a public road without a third party liability insurance. And remember, the contract of insurance is a contract of utmost good faith and both the parties to the contract have to ensure that there is no misinformation or non-disclosure of material facts.Usually when you change your insurer during renewal or take a fresh policy on a new car, in order to claim the NCB discount, you need to produce a certificate of proof from your previous insurer. In fact, if you look at the insurance regulator’s web page meant for policy holders, it says that the proof can be the renewal notice from the current insurer or your original expiring policy along with a certification from your previous insurer, saying that you have lodged no claim on the expiring policy. Obviously, in this case the insurer did not do due diligence and insist on that proof from the consumer! And in the bargain, earned a hefty premium, without having to fulfill its part of the contract of insurance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/make-sure-you-give-correct-details-for-buying-insurance-policy-101628532736304.html

09-08-2021||Mumbai||May ease more curbs from Sept 1 if Covid cases fall: Maha task force member||A senior member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force said on Monday said if cases continue to witness a decline in the state, the government will consider easing more curbs starting September 1.Dr Shashank Joshi also spoke about the need to conduct a state-specific serosurvey to gauge the presence of antibodies among people of Maharashtra.“It is necessary to have a Maharashtra-specific sero-survey to have a better understanding of the situation in the state. Maharashtra is still dealing with a thick tail of COVID-19 cases and it is very notorious," he was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.He further said the presence of antibodies, however, does not mean people can mingle among themselves and evade social distancing norms. To prove his point, the endocrinologist said in Brazil – one of the worst-affected countries, besides India and the United States, due to Covid-19, 70 per cent of its population developed antibodies and yet they “suffered severely in the second wave” of the pandemic.Referring to India’s single-day Covid-19 case count, Dr Joshi said it is ranging between 35,000 and 40,000, of which, Maharashtra is accountable for nearly 6,000. “Our state is still on the second spot (after Kerala) in terms of daily Covid-19 cases,” he added.Stating that the Maharashtra government’s efforts are aimed at “reducing the thick tail” of the coronavirus, he said the people are expected to be “more patient.”“We need to avoid the mistakes made between the first and second waves,” Dr Joshi said, adding that the state government is taking each step slowly and with utmost caution due to the above-mentioned reasons.Addressing the issue of reopening schools at a time, he said that it is “globally proven” that schools and religious gatherings have worked as “super spreaders” of the virus outbreak.“The US prematurely reopened schools and (now), it is not just reporting a higher number of cases, but deaths are also increasing there,” the doctor further said.Notably, Maharashtra education minister Varsha Gaikwood on Friday said that schools in both rural and urban areas of the state will reopen for physical classes on August 17. While offline classes in rural areas will resume for classes 5 to 8, the same in urban regions will commence for students in classes 8 to 12, news agency ANI reported.He also spoke about Maharashtra not having enough Covid-19 vaccine doses to administer to its citizens. Dr Joshi said the state government’s goal is to inoculate maximum (adult) population with both the doses of coronavirus vaccines. “(More) relaxations in Mumbai could be introduced after 70 per cent of its population is covered,” Dr Joshi added.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said fully vaccinated people will be permitted to travel on Mumbai suburban trains from August 15. However, people who have taken the second dose of the vaccine must wait for 14 days before availing of the local train services.Also Read | Maharashtra will take calculated risk on relaxations: UddhavIn a tweet, Thackeray said the government is trying to maintain a balance between containing the virus spread and opening up financial activities. “I know that people are running out of patience due to the lockdown curbs, but we should not lower our guard as the Covid-19 crisis is not over as yet,” the tweet added.Maharashtra reported 4,505 new coronavirus cases and 68 fatalities on Monday, taking the respective toll to 63,57,833 and 1,34,064, according to data shared by the health department. This is an improvement when compared to Sunday’s figures when the state recorded 5,508 fresh cases and a total of 151 deaths. The state has 68,375 active cases and the total number of recoveries has reached 61,51,956, the health department data showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/may-ease-more-curbs-from-sept-1-if-covid-cases-fall-maha-task-force-member-101628531692554.html

They have been put in isolation and their contacts are being traced and tested, said officials on Monday.The officials said that 26 of the total 28 travellers traced by the department since August 1 have tested negative. While the focus has been on nine high-risk states identified by the Uttar Pradesh government, travellers from all the states are under scrutiny, according to the officials.“Surveillance teams are at their toes to identify and trace travellers entering Gautam Budh Nagar...,” said Dr Sunil Kumar Sharma, chief medical officer (CMO), GB Nagar.The surveillance drive started in the district on July 24, 2021, after the state government mandated travellers coming from other states having a weekly Covid-19 positivity rate of 3% or more to carry a negative RT-PCR report not older than four days, or a vaccination certificate indicating that they had been administered both the doses. The measures have been taken to prevent a possible third wave of Covid-19, the officials added.The Directorate of Medical & Health Services, Uttar Pradesh, had issued the last advisory for travellers entering the state on July 19, 2021. According to the advisory, travellers from Kerala, Maharashtra, Manipur, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura and Sikkim have been asked to follow the rules.The health department is relying on 600 surveillance teams comprising ASHA and Anganwadi workers. It has also asked various resident bodies in the district to inform about such passengers between August 1 and August 15. Health officials said that the apartment owners’ associations (AOAs) and residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) can share information on WhatsApp number (9971208271). An option for self-notification of travellers on Integrated Command Control Centre helpline (18004192211) of the district has also been added.“A passenger from a high-risk state, who wants to notify himself to the district health department, can call on the ICCC helpline from Thursday,” said a health department official.Meanwhile, GB Nagar on Monday reported two fresh cases of Covid-19 and five new discharges, according to the state’s health bulletin.

On Friday, this Sector 135 resident booked on the Co-WIN portal a vaccination slot for Monday at the community health centre (CHC) in Bisrakh. But come Monday, no vaccination was taking place there and he had to return home disappointed. Thirty-two-year-old Govind Paswan, who resides in Sector 22, also could not get his first dose vaccine at the employees’ state insurance corporation (ESIC) hospital in Sector 24, despite booking a slot there for Monday. The statewide shortage of vaccines affected the inoculation drive in Gautam Budh Nagar district on Monday as shots were available at only 16 government centres in the district, as opposed to at least 42 till last week. With the limited stock of vaccines, the district health department could administer only 3,868 shots on Monday – of which 1,805 were first doses. The situation is unlikely to improve this week, the district health officials said, as the state is only supplying limited quantities currently. Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said with the present supply, it will be impossible to run the vaccination drive at full swing. “At present, the district health department is left with around 10,000 doses of vaccines. With this available stock, we can run the drive for two more days, and that too not full-fledged. However, we’ve sent our requisition for vaccines to the state and hope to get adequate supply very soon. After that, we’ll be able to restart the drive in the district at full swing,” he said. Echoing similar views, Dr Neeraj Tyagi, said till adequate vials arrive in the district, the vaccination will take place with reduced number of booths, about 16 of them. “The reduction or increase in the number of booths is directly proportional to the stock of vaccines. There is nothing to panic about as getting slots on the Co-WIN portal is not in our control. Notice has been displayed at all booths where the vaccination is not taking place about the drive being curtailed on account of a supply shortage,” he said. Tyagi further said so far 1,737,103 people have been administered the vaccine in the district. “While 1,408,011 have taken the first shot and as many as 3,29,092 have received both the doses,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-reduces-vaccination-sites-to-just-16-as-supply-runs-low-101628531416160.html

The latest review article published in the Journal of Endocrine Society has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the Covid-19 disease is not only affecting the pancreas, but also other endocrine glands, even leading to male sexual disorders, said professor Gyan Chand of SGPGIMS.Giving more details, he said, “The department of internal medicine at Loyola University Medical Centre, Maywood, Illinois (USA) and the department of medicine, division of endocrinology, Loyola University Health Care System, and endocrinology section, medical service, VA Hospital, Hines, Illinois have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) virus is causing moderate to severe disease in about 15% of post-Covid patients.”“It has widespread effects throughout the body with myriad clinical manifestations, including the endocrine system. It is having an impact on the pathophysiology and management of diabetes (both outpatient and inpatient) as well as pituitary, adrenal, thyroid, bone, and gonadal function,” he added.The gonadal hormones were more affected in males resulting in altered sperm quality and reduced testosterone.He said these patients required proper treatment for four to six months.“In some cases, patients returning for treatment have reported widespread effects throughout the body with lesser-known clinical manifestations,” he added.Dr Gyan Chand also said, “It is known to everyone that Covid virus sticks to ACE-2 receptors. Hence, it is affecting all the endocrine glands.” [ACE2 receptor is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. It provides the entry point for the coronavirus to hook into and infect a wide range of human cells.]“There are several reports of scrotal discomfort, even severe scrotal pain in people once infected with Covid-19,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/postcovid-patients-suffer-hormonal-imbalance-lucknow-s-sgpgi-opd-gets-10-such-cases-daily-says-expert-101628531116726.html

These farmers from 26 villages of Ghaziabad have been agitating for the past several years for an equal rate of land compensation and also demanding a service road along the expressway from Modinagar to Mohiuddinpur. The DME phase 4 is 32km long and connects Dasna in Ghaziabad to Meerut. BKU leader Rakesh Tikait, who is spearheading the farmers’ protest at the UP Gate in Ghaziabad against the Centre’s three new farm laws, addressed a gathering of around 800 farmers at a panchayat near DME’s Bhojpur toll plaza. “We have been protesting against the farm laws for the past nine months. We will also support the farmers of 26 villages and pursue their demands for equal land compensation and the service road. You (the farmers) should continue the fight against the UP government and should ‘treat’ them when they come to seek votes,” Tikait said while addressing the panchayat. “This fight will be taken forward and this road (DME) will help us to take our fight (of demand for rollback of three farm laws) to different parts of the country. This region (western UP) has always helped us in our agitation. We will, along with affected farmers, meet NHAI officials and district administration officials,” he added. Officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said that they have no issues if farmers come for discussion about the points raised on Monday. “The land compensation has been given in accordance with the Land Acquisition Act. The expressway manual guidelines have been followed for the DME and there is no provision of service road near to the expressway,” said Mudit Garg, project director, NHAI. Ghaziabad district magistrate RK Singh was not available for a comment on the issue. The phase 4, along with phase 2 (UP Gate to Dasna), were opened to the public in April this year.

The Faridabad Metropolitan Development Authority has started working to develop a restoration plan for the area. Officials said that talks are underway with experts to understand the species of plants and trees that can be planted in this region to restore the natural ecosystem of the Aravalli forests.Garima Mittal, the chief executive officer of FMDA, said, “A nagar van (city forest) was already approved by the state government, which will be built here as encroachments from the land have been cleared off. The urban forest will be developed over 150 acres, which will help us regain forests in the city. We are in talks with forest officials to identify what species of plants should be planted here so that the original ecosystem of the Aravallis can be restored.” Over the past few weeks, around 10,000 houses in Khori village were demolished after the Supreme Court on June 7 had ordered the eviction of thousands of slum dwellers encroaching on the Aravalli forest area, holding that “there cannot be a compromise or concession on forest land.” Meanwhile, debris from the village is still to be cleared completely. Officials said that the demolition drive in the village has been mostly completed, but as people are still taking their belongings to other places, it will take some time for the restoration work to start. As a part of the eco-restoration plan, the authority also released a helpline -- 01140844855 -- for citizens to contact and help with the restoration project as well as provide inputs. “Several NGOs [non-governmental organisations] and concerned citizens are interested in helping with the eco-restoration in Khori village. We have issued a number where people can share their ideas and all the inputs and ideas will be taken into account while making the final plan,” Mittal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/following-demolition-urban-forest-to-come-up-on-150-acres-in-khori-village-101628530461591.html

Of the total beneficiaries, 22 women reported symptoms such as fever and headache after taking the first vaccine shot, according to the data available with the health department.Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said, “At least 22 women and 11 other people among general population reported minor side effects, such as fever and headache, which is a common symptom after taking the first shot of vaccine. Our health workers will be in contact with the (pregnant) women who reported symptoms.”As per an advisory issued by the union health department, pregnant women can get their vaccine jab at any stage of pregnancy. Officials said that in case a woman is infected with Covid-19 after taking the first shot, the second shot will be administered only after the delivery.Officials said that as part of a statewide initiative, vaccines will be administered to pregnant women on the ninth day of every month through special drives under the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan. Under the government programme, all pregnant women registered with the health department get a free anti-natal check-up on the ninth day of every month.Officials said that the Covid-19 vaccination during the monthly check-up will help in the immunisation of women against the coronavirus infection. “At all the 34 designated government health centres, pregnant women were inoculated with Covaxin. On September 9, they will receive the second dose of Covaxin, which will complete their vaccine schedule under the Covid-19 immunisation programme,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer.In July, the central government extended the vaccination drive against the Covid-19 to pregnant women while acting on the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation’s (NTAGI) recommendations. The health ministry issued guidelines for administering the Covid-19 vaccine to pregnant women, stating that after getting the vaccine injection, beneficiaries can get a mild fever, pain at the injection site or feel unwell for one to three days. It also stated that the side effects post-vaccination may include mild discomfort and soreness at the injection spot, accompanied by chills.On Monday, over 15,363 vaccine doses were administered, including 7,258 at government facilities and 8,105 at private hospitals.

The tree falls under corporation land and one needs to take permission for trimming. We will make sure no other trees are cut or trimmed in this locality without permission.”Ravikant Waghchoure, a tree activist from the locality, said, “Such trimming only for the sake of housing society construction work should not be allowed.

Why real development did not reach tribal pockets? And this has not been a case in India only but also across the world. We need to find solutions to these problems and then only these kind of events would have any meaning,” said Munda, who was conferred the Padma Bhushan by the Narendra Modi goverment in 2019.The former deputy speaker of Lok Sabha further said that lack of developement helps “anti-social groups in influencing the youth” in joining their cadres. “The reality is that it’s not politics but socio-economic reasons that pushes tribals towards Maoism. Their settlement areas lack in basic development and opportunities, and when interest groups brainwash them with benefits, they join such forces,” said Munda. Deliberating on the way forward, Munda said while the academia need to research and come out with solutions, those in governance need to change their approach in implementation of schemes. “The current approach is target-oriented, while it should be result-oriented. For example, Swachh Bharat Mission scheme. Several districts were declared open defecation free, but the reality is that many toilets in rural areas did not last. The roads and bridges get washed away within a year of construction. So, every well-meaning person will have to ponder and contribute if we want to uplift the tribals,” said Munda. Speaking on the occasion, KB Das, who recently took over the charge of CUJ vice-chancellor, underlined that tribal lifestyle that is more sustainable. “There are around 500 million tribals across 90 countries. Out of that, 100 million live in India. The value system and living in consonance with nature and their indigenous wisdom has in fact given us a new model of sustainable development,” said Das.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/socioeconomic-reasons-behind-spread-of-maoism-in-tribal-areas-says-kariya-munda-101628526018004.html

Locals’ miseries in state capital Patna have burgeoned further, as gushing currents of rivers Sone and Punpun engulfed fresh areas of diara and low-lying villages along its course. Hundreds of families of Nakta diara and Bindtoli in Patna have already shifted to safer places after their houses were completely submerged with floodwaters of Ganga. A senior officer of water resources department said those living along the banks of Ganga have been asked to evacuate fast, as the river has been maintaining a rising trend. Ganga was reported flowing around one metre above the DL at Gandhi Ghat in Patna, 33cm above DL at Buxar, 88cm at Hathidah and 73cm at Kahalgaon. Punpun was flowing around 50cm above the DL at Sripalpur. Sone was flowing above the DL at Maner. In Bhojpur district, dozens of villages have been disconnected from the district headquarters, as floodwaters from Ganga and Sone inundated a vast stretch of land. Standing crops and vegetables on the land along the rivers have also been washed away. The rising water from Ganga is also threatening to disrupt traffic on Ara-Buxar road, which is barely a few feet above the turbulent water. Executive engineer of Ara flood control department, Shambhu Kumar, said that the DL of Ganges is 53.08m, but on Monday, it reached up to 53.78m. “River Ganga has crossed the DL. The department and administration is keeping a strict watch,” he said. The floodwaters have also started to reach in dozens of villages spread over Barhara, Shahpur, Ara, Udwantnagar, Bihiya and Koilwar blocks, with Barhara block being the worst affected.

This will pinch the consumers as they would not only lose the rebate, which the discoms extend for timely payment of energy bills, but also have to pay delayed payment surcharge (DPS) for payment after the due date. The discoms are yet to take a decision on waiver of DPS on energy bills in this case, rued consumers.However, the NBPDCL, on a contingency basis, has initiated door-to-door collection of the power bill.“We have extended the door-to-door collection of payment for energy bills even in urban areas. Earlier, this arrangement was confined only to rural areas, but following the snag in the server, we have extended the facility even to urban areas,” said an officer who requested anonymity.“This will facilitate payment of consumers whose bills have already been generated,” he added.Efforts to reach the top brass in the Bihar State Power Holding Company and the two discoms proved futile. Sanjeevan Sinha, managing director, SBPDCL, and Arvind Kumar, SBPDCL general manager (revenue) did not respond to phone calls or text messages.“We are trying to recover our server. We will let you know once it has been done,” said Chaturbhuj Mishra, chief data-based administrator of the SBPDCL, before he hung up.Box:Consumers across 63 towns in 35 districts, excluding Muzaffarpur, Gaya and Bhagalpur have been affectedSnag affected 5-6 lakh consumers under NBPDCL It affected 10-12 lakh consumers under SBPDCL .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/snag-in-billing-server-affects-15-lakh-consumers-in-bihar-101628525656426.html

My letter has also reached the prime Minister on August 4 itself in this regard,” he said, after his weekly “Janata ke durbar me mukhyamantri” programme to listen to people’s problems directly and address them. “If the PM gives time, we will also meet him. Other states are also discussing it. Our MPs also wanted to meet PM, but they were asked to meet the home minister and they met and presented their views,” he said. Kumar said only the Centre could decide on a caste-based census . “If we have to do it, it will be counting, not Census to get information. Census is done only at the national level. Some states have done it at their level. Karnataka did it. If we have to decide on caste census in Bihar, we will do it later after discussing. But we want it to be done at the national level so that it happens across the country,” he said. The last caste census was done in 1931, as per which backward castes consisted of 51.3%population in the state.In 2017, the Centre had set up Justice Rohini Commission, which favoured sub-categorisation of reservation for other backward castes (OBCs) in the government sector by splitting 27% quota into different categories of OBCs for equitable distribution of benefits among different sub-castes. After several extensions, it submitted its report, dividing 2633 OBC sub-castes in the central list into four sub-categories with 2%, 6%, 9% and 10% quota to add up to 27%. Before that, in 2011, socio-economic and caste census was done in 2011, though caste data could never be made public due to several discrepancies. To date, Census only makes count of population based on religion and of SC/ST population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/nitish-reiterates-demand-for-caste-census-says-it-s-in-interest-of-all-101628525536555.html

An autopsy has ruled out rape. Police have arrested four people and charged them with kidnapping (Section 363 of the IPC) and murder (Section 302) .Munger superintendent of police (SP) JJ Reddy told reporters that Parvez Alam, who claims to be a tantric, told local villager Dilip Kumar Choudhary that he needed to sacrifice a girl to avert the possibility of his pregnant wife’s miscarriage.Choudhury, who was present at the press conference and is one of the four accused, said he had four children -- two sons and two daughters -- but wanted a fifth. He said he got in touch with Alam, a resident of Khagaria district.Alam, Choudhury claimed, asked for the eye of 10-year-old boy or a girl so that he could prepare an amulet for the woman “consecrated” with the blood and eyes of a minor. “We committed the crime on the instigation of Alam,” said the main accused, Dilip to police.The other two arrested accused people are Tanvir Alam and Dasrath Kumar who allegedly were accomplices of Alam and Choudhury, police said.The girl, a student of class 3, went missing on the evening of August 4 and her mutilated body was found on the banks of Ganga the next day.According to police, Choudhary, Tanvir and Dasrath assembled near a brick kiln and caught the girl when she was returning home after delivering lunch to her father, who is a fisherman.A complaint was lodged on August 4 evening when she did not reach home. Her body was found the next morning.The three dragged her inside the brick kiln and thrashed her before strangulating her and gouging her right eye. Her body also bore injury marks, giving rise to initial suspicion that she was raped, police said.The SP said police recovered bloodstained cloth and a pendant and sent it for forensic examination. “The medical board report did not confirm rape,” said Reddy.The police earlier detained 12 people in the case but all were freed after questioning. Alam was arrested from his home at Khagaria after Dilip Choudhary confessed to his crime.The girl’s mother and father trashed the police theory, claiming their child was raped before being killed.. “Police have cooked up a story. We need justice,” the father said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/munger-minor-s-killing-4-arrested-police-say-a-case-of-human-sacrifice-101628524696427.html

09-08-2021||Delhi||Zero waste kitchen: reduce, reuse, recycle||With the global pandemic bringing many changes in our life, many individuals are moving towards more responsible and sustainable food practices. Hence in an attempt to embrace the thriftiness and cut down on food wastage, the notion of zero waste kitchen is gaining popularity and finding more takers. “Wastage at the kitchen can be lowered through a variety of options, such as – buying local and seasonal fruits and vegetables, reducing, reusing, recycling, and proper planning and execution of both raw materials and food scraps and leftovers. I was encouraged to come up with recipes and menus to work on the concept. We have been conscious of reducing carbon footprints from all our kitchens from recycling waste and peels, to innovative recipes to ensure a sustainable and zero waste kitchens,” says Madhumita Mohanta, executive chef, The Lalit Great Eastern Kolkata.The term zero waste may sound intimidating but it is technically just a shift of habit – from buying to storage, from finishing food to recycling leftovers. “Each and everything can be used. It is the awareness which is important to ensure zero wastage. Potatoes are a commonly used vegetable in Indian kitchens. Its peels can be converted into an awesome pakoras or bhajiya. Crush the peels with garlic, chilies, fresh green coriander and seasoning. Dip in a light batter and fry. For beetroots, roast the peel and create a powder. If stored well, it can be used for a long duration. One can also make an aromate out of the same with beetroot peel garam masala. Raw banana peel can be used for chutney, watermelon skin for tutti frutti,” says chef Nishant Choubey.Moreover, adapting such practices cab also help gain more nutrition from your everyday food as there are many vegetables and fruits whose skin have nutritious value. “Potato skin contains B vitamins, vitamin C, iron, calcium, potassium and other nutrients. It gives crunchiness to the dish. There are many other fruits and vegetables which should be consumed with skin for the nutritious value. Most peels contain fiber, vitamins and minerals in them,” says Mohanta.On order to achieve zero waste kitchen, one can start with simple methods such as reducing the usage of plastic. Carry bags and jars while shopping. Super markets are convenient but the packaged food means a lot of waste. Buy fresh. “Introduce compost bin in your homes. Reuse vegetable and fruit peel for garnishing or some healthy recipes. Try eating whole foods and avoid packaged food. In case of gatherings, pass on the leftovers to NGOs or distribute it to the people who are in need,” says Mohanta. Even while preparing non-vegetarian food, one can use the leftovers. “If you are left with chicken/mutton pieces, grind it, add leftover daal and convert them into sumptuous Shami kebabs. Hari Mirch Keema can be made out of minced mutton Koftas. One can use gosht keema to fill bottle guards and believe you me they taste nostalgia. Prepare Yakhni with leftover mutton bones and then relish Yakhni pulao,” says Shazia Bukhari, culinary expert from Sheikh Shack.You would be surprised to know the fruit waste can be used to make disinfectant and soaps. “Our juice centre in Bangalore is a waste engineering centre. Our purpose has always been to engineer the waste. We do waste segregation and use separate bins to keep fruit pulp, skin peel, seed and other waste. Similarly, there is a collection bin only for citrus peels. We make bio enzymes out of all the citrus peels and use them to sanitize the place. As a result we do not buy any chemical disinfectants. The pulp from filtered fruit waste is used to make fruit soaps and use banana leaves, areca leaves and many other natural leaves to package these natural soaps. We are also exploring the idea of using seeds to make jewellery,” says Anand Raj, founder of Eat Raja, zero waste juice bar.

09-08-2021||Lucknow||Like Kakori martyrs, people should unite for self-reliant India, says Yogi Adityanath||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday paid tribute to the martyrs of the Kakori train action in which a train was robbed by freedom fighters at Kakori on the outskirts of Lucknow on August 9, 1925 during the struggle for India’s independence.Irrespective of caste, colour and creed, people should stand united just like in the freedom movement and help in making “aatmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India), he said.The chief minister also said the Kakori train action was the perfect example of unity where bravehearts from different religions came together under the leadership of Ram Prasad Bismil and fought in the nation’s interest.“In the same way, taking a cue from such patriotic acts of bravery, we should stand united and help India in achieving the goal of aatmanirbhar Bharat. The Amrit Mahotsav that is being observed to commemorate the 75th anniversary of freedom is all about celebrating this unity. I appeal to people, irrespective of their religion and caste or occupation to work together, in their own capacities and in the nation’s interest, to help in building aatmanirbhar Bharat,” he said.The chief minister was speaking at a programme organised to mark the anniversary of the Kakori train action.The function was organised under the Chauri Chaura Mahotsav that the UP government is observing to mark the Chauri Chaura incident which is going to complete 100 years on February 4, 2022. The incident was reported on February 4, 1922, when a large group of protesters barged into a police station in Chauri Chaura town of Gorakhpur and set it on fire, killing 22 policemen during the freedom movement. Three civilians also died.The chief minister said the Chauri Chaura Mahotsav was all about paying tribute to the freedom fighters who laid down their lives for the country.“I believe that our country never bowed before the British government. At some point or places, there were regular incidents of retaliation. Be it the Chauri Chaura episode, the Kakori train action, the freedom fighters of Meerut or so on. It’s time to pay tribute to the brave freedom fighters and we assure all possible support to their family members,” he added.Uttar Pradesh governor Anandiben Patel appreciated Amrit Mahotsav and blamed previous governments for burying such events and for manipulating history.“I am thankful to PM for introducing Amrit Mahotsav and the UP government that played an important role in paying tribute to the freedom fighters and for highlighting their acts of bravery in order to make the present generation aware of their selfless contributions,” the governor said.She said people should shun casteism and imbibe patriotism.The event also witnessed various cultural programmes where students from different schools and colleges performed, highlighting the Kakori train action episode.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/like-kakori-martyrs-people-should-unite-for-self-reliant-india-says-yogi-adityanath-101628520796052.html

Sidhu, who has been critical of the state government headed by Capt Amarinder Singh on this issue, said that punishing the culprits behind drug trade was the priority of the Congress under the 18-point agenda. The party’s central leadership has a given a to-do list to chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh for implementation before next year’s assembly elections in the state. He also asked what action had been taken against SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia. In a series of tweets, the PPCC chief said that the STF headed by ADGP Harpreet Sidhu had in February 2018 filed a “status report” in Punjab and Haryana high court, investigating statements and evidence recorded by ED that were submitted before the court in case of Bikramjit Singh Majithia and others. “What investigation had Punjab police done? What action has Punjab govt taken? Must be brought into public domain. Since submission of reports, what further action did the state take in 2.5 years? Govt must make itself accountable to the public with complete transparency,” he posted on Twitter. Sidhu said that he held a press conference in 2018, asking the government to immediately act upon the information shared by STF with the court, after investigating into incriminating evidence produced before the court by the Enforcement Directorate. “The high court had asked the Punjab government to proceed as per law on the STF report. On May 23, 2019, the government filed before the court an opinion-cum-status report that still awaits the light of day in sealed envelope. After 2.5 years of delay, how much more the people of Punjab should wait,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-attacks-capt-govt-over-inaction-in-stf-reports-on-drugs-101628516115189.html

09-08-2021||Pune||Monday musings: Relaxations given, but has the MVA government learnt its lessons?||PUNE After a back-and-forth for over two weeks, Pune has been unlocked again with the rider that a rise in Covid positivity rate beyond 7% will result in all relaxations rolled back immediately without any notice. The announcement came on the day when Pune reported three cases of the Delta plus variant, known for spreading faster than other coronavirus variants. As part of relief from Monday, Pune, along with Pimpri-Chinchwad, will see timings for essential and non-essential services extended up to 8 pm, while hotels and restaurants can operate till 10pm. The most distinct element of this announcement by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar is that weekend lockdown has finally gone away. This will be second time within two months that the government has had to relax restrictions that were brought back in July, days after the second wave waned, though the danger of the Delta-plus variant persisted. However to be able to get relief, traders had to fought hard and resorted to defiance, keeping shops open past the stipulated deadline of 4pm for the past four days. The entire issue could have been handled by the government in a much better way. It highlighted multiple things - starting with lack of coordination, shrugging off responsibility, and an inconsistency at the policy level. Initially, citizens were told that the government will take a call, although health minister Rajesh Tope announced that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will decide on relaxations for Maharashtra, based on a proposal sent in by his department. The proposal, however, considered Pune city as part of the district, even as the government’s previous orders clearly considered Pune, PCMC and the rural parts as three separate administrative units. The government’s original directive, as Tope had explained, was areas with a positivity rate less than that of state average would get relief. This was not followed in the case of Pune city. So when traders began a civil disobedience movement in Pune defying the 4pm deadline, the government changed tack saying that if the local administration recommends relief, the government will consider it. The government did not apply the same rules to Mumbai or other places where relaxations were given. This was a readymade issue for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to lap up and target the Maha Vikas Aghadi government. When asked, Ajit Pawar’s response to this was – anyone when asked about Pune should say the guardian minister will decide in consultation with CM. His response indicated one thing: Pawar asserted his position by sending the message to others that he will take the final call on Pune. Three constituents (Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress) form the MVA government, and it has adopted a specific working method with decisions related to Pune and rest of the western Maharashtra largely taken by Ajit Pawar, while the chief minister has largely remained silent about issues here. Even during the peak of Covid (Pune saw two peaks during the first and second wave), Thackeray visited the city only once. The MVA also largely ignored its own notification related to different levels, the purpose of which was to offer relaxations or bring back curbs based on which level – between 1 to 5 –districts fall under. If the government is pro-decentralisation, why then it did not allow PMC to decide for itself, when the local body had recommended relaxations two week ago, and Pawar too, had agreed to it. Finally, the confusion and delay resulted in discontent among citizens and the business community. The government realised this and offered relief. The responsibility now rests on shop keepers, business establishments and citizens to adhere to Covid appropriate behaviour. Any laxity in following the norms can cost Pune dearly, especially when only 21 per cent of the population here has been vaccinated fully. At the current speed, it may take four more months for the district to vaccinate its population with both doses.

09-08-2021||Chandigarh||Toy story: We carry a piece of childhood, innocence within||“Mere saare khilone kahan hain (Where are all my toys)?” exclaimed my son. “I can’t see any of mine either,” said my daughter, who had followed him into the room. I had been spring cleaning in autumn, giving away stuff, story books, building blocks, board games and stuffed toys. The things that, it now seemed, I had wrongly assumed they had outgrown. My kids were home on an overdue visit, and we had decided to play Ludo, the real kind, with the colourful board, the six-faced dice and the flat round pawns. That’s when the outburst happened. My son had gone to retrieve the board game from his room. Luckily, I had not dispensed with it, knowing that it was a family favourite. They were still disappointed with the way it was relinquished to a corner of the cupboard, alone, with all its companions gone. To console them, I pointed out the stuff I had retained. I had kept my daughter’s first designer kit which had templates to draw outfits with prints, my son’s mechanical toy set that enabled him to screw together a truck and helicopter. Despite the space it occupied, I had kept my daughter’s life-size stuffed lion and my son’s oversized dog. I had preserved some of their notebooks and all their certificates. But to them, the room was half empty not half full. This is a familiar scene in households around the globe, albeit there might be a minuscule difference here. My daughter is a much-married designer and my son a software engineer at Mountain View! Long after they had left, I kept wondering what makes us cling to certain childhood paraphernalia. Psychologists opine that the fundamental difference lies in the perspective. For adults, all toys are store bought objects that engage and harness creativity, but children associate the entire experience of fun with some of them. They imbue these toys with joyful memories, making them more meaningful. So, the reason is partly nostalgia and partly “essentialism”, or the idea that objects are more than just their physical properties. Further research showed that they are aptly called transitional objects. Paediatric psychoanalyst Dr Donald Winnicott placed them in the “intermediate space” that opens up between mother and baby, once the baby is able to differentiate itself as an independent entity, separate from its mother. Whenever we feel vulnerable, insecure or anxious these cherished objects have the ability to reassure and provide a sense of security, which is why kids never outgrow them. Which brings me to the next question: Do we parents truly outgrow them? Frankly, we, with all our cynicism and disdain for childish sulks, are no better than our kids. Have you ever wondered why we choose toys for our kids with so much care? Why we linger in toy stores, touching and feeling the merchandise? Why we need to ‘try out’ the crazy ball or frisbee before handing it to our child? We are using toys to live our unfulfilled dreams. All of us carry a piece of childhood within; an innocence that refuses to be tainted by the business of living. Toys are our connection with that inner child. Do we need toys? Well, of course, toys are us! dr_manjugupta@icloud.com The writer is a Gharaunda-based gynaecologist||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/toy-story-we-carry-a-piece-of-childhood-innocence-within-101628502435120.html

In the Varanasi discom, as many as 105,306 meters were never read while the number of such meters was 47,421 in Agra discom, 33,816 in Lucknow discom and 8,794 in Meerut discom.It was further found that 606,915 consumers with defective meters have never paid even a single electricity bill since 2006. “This means that consumers are either not paying bills, or the power connections do not exist on the site or these consumers have subscribed to fresh connections,” Kumar said in the circular.As per the provisions, bills to a power consumer can be issued only for two billing cycles, after which the defective meter must be replaced within 15 days of the testing report. Moreover, consumers are also entitled under the same provisions to a compensation of ₹50 per day if the defective or the burnt meter is not replaced after 15 days of it being tested.Kumar mentioned all these provisions in the circular, asking MDs to fix the timeframe to replace all the faulty meters in keeping with the provisions that also say that not more than 3% of the meters vis-à-vis the number of consumers should be defective at one time. UPPCL has 29.7 million power connections in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-faulty-power-meters-go-beyond-permissible-limit-101628486533959.html
09-08-2021||Patna||Bihar’s AKU awaits fulltime V-C since September last year||The vice chancellor (V-C) post in Bihar’s Aryabhatt Knowledge University (AKU) has been vacant since September 20, 2020.AKU’s advertisement seeking applications, issued by the Raj Bhavan, has been cancelled twice through the process, the latest being last month. Set up in 2010 to regulate all technical institutions by bringing them under one umbrella, AKU has been without a regular V-C since the term of Arun Kumar Agarwal ended. Former AKU pro-V-C Syed Mohammad Karim held the additional charge till his retirement a couple of months ago.Now, Lalit Narayan Mithila University V-C SP Singh holds the additional charge along with that of other universities.The Raj Bhavan invited applications for the appointment of V-C in January this year after cancelling the September 2020 advertisement “due to unavoidable reasons”. But before the process could be completed, the advertisement was cancelled and a fresh one issued on January 14, 2021 through a notification from Raj Bhavan. The last date for submitting applications was March 1.Also Read | Bihar to acquire documents in private collections linked to Quit India movementNow, the second advertisement has also been cancelled without any further notification. “The re-advertisement datedJanuary 14, 2021regarding submission of application form for the appointment of V-C in AKU is cancelled due to some unavoidable reasons,” said a July 10 letter from Robert L Chongthu, principal secretary to the governor.Sources in the department of education said that a lot would depend on the trifurcation of the AKU, regarding which Bills were also passed by the Bihar assembly during the just concluded monsoon session. After governor Phagu Chauhan’s nod, AKU would no more be a university like before to regulate all technical institutions -- there would be separate universities for health and engineering, besides one for sports with the chief minister, not the governor, as the chancellor of the proposed universities. “After the gazette notification, the process for the appointment of V-Cs in the new universities could begin afresh,” an official added. However, all the four Bills related to universities are yet to get gubernatorial nod. If the Governor does not approve of it, as had happened in 2015 when former Governor Keshri Nath Tripathi refused to give his nod to a Bill for the constitution of a university and college tribunal on the lines of the Central Administrative Tribunal to deal with the growing number of court cases, it could cause further delay. Despite former Advocate General and then education minister PK Shahi meeting Keshri in this regard, he remained unconvinced. The tribunal was in the pipeline for over six years. The only difference was that in 2015, the governor’s nod was sought ahead of placing the Bill before the Cabinet and the House and once refused, it could not be placed. However, sources said that such a requirement was restricted to money Bills only. At present, the government is keeping its fingers crossed, as none of the seven Bills passed during the monsoon session have been signed by the governor yet. “It usually comes after a week. The session ended on July 30 only,” said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihars-aku-awaits-fulltime-v-c-since-september-last-year-101628486053879.html

However, two friends of the deceased Madhushree Kursange who are also feared drowned remain untraced even four days after the incident, they said. "Kursange's body was brought to her residence in suburban Borivali to perform her last rites," her kin said, adding some of them had gone to Haridwar to claim the body. A group of five friends, including Kursange, Apoorva Kelkar, Melroy Dantes, Karan Mishra, and another girl, had gone to Tapovan in the northern state on a picnic last week.Mishra, who had witnessed the incident on August 4, had told PTI over the phone from Haridwar that he and another girl took a dip in the river and came out, but three others, including Kursange, entered the deep water to take another dip. "They couldn't return to the river bank due to the strong current of water and swept away. One of them shouted for help, but we couldn't do anything," he had said. All the students are residents of Mumbai and extended suburbs. Mishra also said that Kelkar and Dantes are yet to be traced in the Ganga river.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/body-of-mumbai-student-who-drowned-in-haridwar-recovered-2-others-remain-untraced-101628481985100.html
09-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra allows fully vaccinated to use Mumbai locals from August 15||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday announced that people fully vaccinated against Covid-19 will be allowed to commute in local trains in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) from August 15, but only 14 days after taking the second dose. A decision over relaxations for malls, theatres, restaurants and religious places will be taken on Monday, he said.Thackeray spoke about relaxations in Covid restrictions, the threat of the third Covid wave and the need to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour in his tweets on Sunday evening.“The second wave of Covid-19 has not fully subsided. The threat of the third wave is still looming large. I know that people are running out of patience due to the lockdown curbs, but we should not lower our guard as the Covid-19 crisis is not over as yet. We are trying to strike a balance between keeping the virus in check and opening up financial activities,” Thackeray said in his tweet.The general commuters were banned from local trains in the first week of April after the second wave hit, only two months after the services had resumed on February 1 after nearly a year of the network remaining off limits for the general public beginning march 2020, due to the outbreak of the first wave of the pandemic. Only a few categories of emergency and essential services workers were allowed during the period.As per the new arrangement, fully vaccinated people will have to register themselves on a mobile application that is being developed by the government before they can travel on the local train network. The registration facility will also be available offline at the offices of the civic bodies and railway offices. In Mumbai, 1.9 million people will be eligible for this relaxation on August 15, having completed two weeks after receiving the second dose of the vaccine before August 1.The fully vaccinated commuters will be issued passes through the mobile application after registration and submission of their vaccination certificates. The passes will bear a QR code, which will enable them to access the local train network, a government official said.Maharashtra recorded 5,508 Covid cases and 151 deaths on Sunday, while Mumbai added 305 new cases and nine deaths, taking the city’s death toll to 15,951. The state tally of Covid-19 cases stands at 6.35 million and the death toll has touched 133,996.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-allows-fully-vaccinated-people-to-use-mumbai-locals-from-august-15-101628477653374.html

09-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi's weekly markets to re-open from today||All weekly markets in the national capital will re-open from Monday, as the Delhi government eased Covid-19 curbs followin a decline in the number of cases. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal made the announcement on Saturday, explaining that this is because his government is worried about people's livelihoods. No weekly market is allowed to function on roadsides, according to the current guidelines."Weekly markets are being opened from Monday. These are poor people. Government is quite concerned about their livelihoods. However, everyone's health and lives are also important. I urge everyone to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour after these markets are opened," Kejriwal tweeted.These markets were closed in the national capital after a lockdown was imposed on April 19 due to the spike in cases during the second Covid-19 wave. Later on, one weekly market in each municipal zone was allowed to open with proper adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour and official guidelines.The decision from the Delhi government came a day after the meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA). Under DDMA guidelines, district authorities are expected to carry out random RT-PCR and rapid tests of vendors as well as customers thronging the markets.Delhi reported 66 fresh Covid-19 cases and zero deaths due to the infection on Sunday, while the positivity rate stood at 0.10 per cent, according to data shared by the health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-weekly-markets-to-re-open-from-today-101628468739187.html

This follows an order from the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA). Officials on Sunday said that the state education department is expected to release detailed guidelines and reopening protocol for schools and students."Students of class 10 to 12 in the city are permitted to visit their schools from August 9 (Monday) for admission-related work including counselling, guidance and practical activities for board exams. Health checkups and referral services situated in schools or conducted from there can resume. Children of all ages may visit these centres accompanied by their parents or guardians," the DDMA said in its order.The DDMA has specified that schools, coaching centres and colleges will remain closed for teaching purposes and online learning will be encouraged in all circumstances, except the exempted activities.The educational institutions in Delhi have been closed since March this year, when Covid-19 wreaked havoc in the national capital.The DDMA has also allowed the opening of weekly markets across Delhi from Monday with a rider that the vendors and visitors shall follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. "All weekly markets are allowed subject to strict compliance of guidelines issued by the government. No unauthorised weekly market is allowed to function,” the order read.

There is also a system for those who don’t have smartphones. We will have an offline system too. We are also making this appeal to offices -- to stagger work timings and allow those who can WFH to continue,” he said during a live webcast.Mumbai has, so far, fully vaccinated 1.9 million people.Currently, local residents, except for those employed in a few essential sectors and government services, are not allowed to board Mumbai suburban trains.The CM also warned people against lowering their guards.“It’s (Covid) still here. We have seen Covid waves too. What we have learnt is that if we need to arrest the spread, we have to follow Covid protocols and increase vaccination. We have a capacity to vaccinate up to 15 lakh (1.5 million) in a day too as we have already vaccinated 8 lakh (800,000) in a day. We are improving on our health infrastructure.

09-08-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Barfi with mask||No, you don’t commonly spot this delicacy on the streets. Certainly not with this combination—brown barfi with face masks.“I used to sell only barfi, and then the bimari arrived,” says stall owner Raju Kumar, referring to the pandemic. “Since I had some vacant space on my stall, I thought why not sell masks on the side?”The grey-haired seasoned street hawker sure knows how to make the tiny inches count. His stall is a mere wicker stand, topped with a metal platter containing the sweetmeat, each piece cracked at various places due to its brittle texture. The masks are clipped to the stand by plastic hooks. The idea isn’t original; his pandemic-era entrepreneurship is shared by many pavement traders. These days almost every paan kiosk in town has masks hanging beside long strips of sachets of fresheners. The barfi, though, is something unique, especially in this area of east Delhi’s Dilshad Garden, where no other stall owner boasts this tempting treat.“I make it myself, from the khoya of Aligarh… this khoya is of pure buffalo milk,” he reveals. Mr Kumar says it with hushed pride, as if suggesting that the khoya sourced by him is superior to made-in-Delhi khoya. These 20 kg of Aligarh import are delivered to him once every three days. The barfi seller lives with three other men, they all sell barfi, and the khoya is divided equally between themselves. “Each of us makes his own barfi, we all are from Darbhanga in Bihar.”The barfi that Mr Kumar sells on any given day are made the evening before “over the course of two hours.” The good thing is that there’s no old stock in his stall, for he starts his transaction at 7 in the morning and stays on the streets until the stock finishes. “Sometimes all gets over by afternoon, sometimes by 4 or 5 in the evening.”Now a masked customer arrives. He’s not buying mask but the other thing—one big-sized barfi is for 10 rupees, and two smaller versions are for 7 rupees. Mr Kumar uses cuttings of old newspapers as a serving plate. He places a barfi on one cutting and hands it over to the customer. The customer throws away the print edition remnant after finishing. The barfi has the shade of dark wet sand and is embedded with fat raisins. It is super-addictive and gives an instant sugar high.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-barfi-with-mask-101628457500170.html
09-08-2021||Delhi||Time stands nearly still for DDA’s plot allottees||In 1981, then 30-year-old Rakesh Khurana applied for a 90 square metre plot in the Delhi Development Authority’s (DDA) Rohini Residential Scheme, that was part of the agency’s plan to develop the area as a residential hub. He was among the 80,000-odd successful applicants who were to get a plot in the next five years.Four decades later, Khurana, now in his 70s and has retired from a bank job, said the dream is all but over due to inordinate delays in allotment and lack of development in Sector 29, pocket D1, where he was allotted the plot in 2015.Like Khurana, nearly 25,000 applicants were given plots in Sectors 29-37 in Rohini between 2014 and 2018, almost 33 years after the scheme was launched. But very few allottees have constructed houses over the years.“There is no hospital or dispensary, local shopping complex, school etc nearby. They have erected poles but there are no streetlights,” said Raj Kumar Jain, 67, a chartered accountant, who took possession of his plot in Sector 30, pocket C1, in 2015.Another issue the allottees, most of whom are in their mid-60s or 70s, are facing is the cumbersome process to convert their plot from leasehold to freehold.Captain (retd) M S Uppal (76), who was allotted a plot in Sector 37 in 2018, said the plots were given on lease deed and to get complete ownership of the plot, allottees will have to get a freehold deed executed. For this, Uppal said, allottees have to construct a structure on the plot.“We are senior citizens and it is not possible for us to get a room or two constructed there, especially now during the Covid-19 pandemic. We have requested the DDA to simplify the process by taking conversion charges for the freehold process. Some special provisions should be made for us,” said Uppal, who is the president of the Rohini Residential Scheme 1981 Association that was formed in 2015, and has over 500 members.A senior DDA official said, “The freehold process has been streamlined and made online. We are making efforts to bring down the pendency. As for relaxing the norms for freehold process, no decision has been taken as yet.”The schemeThe Rohini Residential Scheme was part of the DDA’s larger plan to develop Rohini as a sub-city. The DDA had close to 1.17 lakh plots in the area in 1981. The agency received 82,384 applications, of which 80,587 applicants were found to be eligible.The plots were to be allotted within a period of five years. Till 1991, the DDA allotted 41,179 plots in various sectors. And between 1991 and 2002, just 1,248 people were allotted plots.Rahul Gupta filed a PIL against the DDA in the Delhi high court in 2009, when allotment to over 25,000-odd applicants was still pending. Gupta said, “Earlier, very little information about what went wrong with the scheme and what DDA was doing about it was available in the public domain. I filed a lot of RTIs regarding the scheme. We gave several representations to the central government, DDA etc. When nothing happened, I decided to file a PIL.”He added, “As DDA failed to fulfil their commitments made in the Delhi high court, I filed a PIL in the Supreme Court in 2012 demanding that developed plots be given to allottees, who have waited for nearly three decades.”DDA officials said the development in sectors 34-37 could start only in 2016 due to legal disputes.A K Jain, former planning commission at DDA, said, “It is a complex problem. The DDA received an unexpected number of applications for the scheme, as the cost of plots was less. DDA kept the scheme open ended and when it did try to close the scheme, it was challenged in the court. The DDA has done a lot to develop these sectors. Things will improve once people start moving in.”Poor planningAllottees say the development (or rather lack of it) in sectors 28-37 is an example of the agency’s poor planning.“They are planning for the city’s development in the next two decades, but DDA couldn’t develop just a few sectors in the last four decades. My plot is in an area which was developed in the last few years. It’s condition is better than most other sectors but I still can’t live there as there is no basic infrastructure,” said Uppal, who lives in Noida, while referring to the Master Plan 2041.Charanjit Singh, who was allotted a plot in Sector 28 in 2003, said, “Even today, very few houses have come up here. The situation has improved after the DDA constructed group housing complexes (with over 5,000 flats) here. But transportation is still a big issue. The nearest Metro station (Rithala) is almost 5-7 kms away.”A DDA official said, “Basic civic work, such as sewer and water pipeline, road network, streetlights etc have been done in all the sectors. But people have not started construction in these areas. Once people start living in these sectors, we will improve the facilities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/time-stands-nearly-still-for-dda-s-plot-allottees-101628457072787.html
09-08-2021||Delhi||Structure at New India Garden may hit green hurdle: Experts||The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) recently relaunched a design competition for an “iconic structure” to be constructed at the proposed New India garden on the western bank of Yamuna, although this could run afoul of both a 2015 National Green Tribunal ruling and a 2016 notification by what is now the Ministry of Jal Shakti.The garden and structure are part of the Central Vista project, which includes a new Parliament building, government offices, residences for the Prime Minister and the Vice President, and the relocation of the National Museum in North Block and South Block.The design competition was first launched last November and has received in excess of 100 entries -- these are displayed on its website -- but CPWD wants more “creative ideas” a CPWD official said on condition of anonymity.Located near the Purana Qila, the garden will be spread over 25 acres on the western bank of the river and have infotainment facilities, a “sphere of unity”. a walkway, an exhibit titled “Journey of India”, a “tech dome“ and an open-air theatre.The last date to submit the entries is October 18 and CPWD plans to complete the construction of the structure before August 15, 2022, which will mark India’s 75th year of independence.The plan could run into some problems arising from a NGT ruling of 2015, though.The National Green Tribunal in its judgement dated January 13, 2015 prohibited any construction activity in the demarcated floodplain area. It added that the floodplain needs to be defined on the basis of a so-called once-in-25-years-flood in the “ “interest of ecology, biodiversity and the river flow.” This basically means all area in the river bank, flooded by the river in the worst flood in the past 25 years will be declared part of the floodplain.NGT directed the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to prepare a map and physically demarcate the entire floodplain.Interestingly, the floodplain criteria is not rigid and subject to change if any public authority challenges regarding it in future, the bench headed by then NGT chairperson, Swatanter Kumar clarified — something that could provide a way out for CPWD.A senior DDA official who asked not to be identified, claimed that a major portion of the proposed gardenis not within the 25 year flood line. This according to its draft master plan MPD 2041There’s another issue — a ministry of water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation notification of October 7, 2016 which applies to all of Ganga’s tributaries including the Yamuna. It defines “flood plain” as that on the bank flooded in a once-in-100-years-flood. It says the floodplain shall be a construction-free zone.In response to HT’s queries, a Union ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) spokesperson said that the proposed site doesn’t fall in the floodplain. A senior MoHUA official “The site is outside the floodplain. All necessary permissions will be taken before construction work starts.”The current zone ‘O’ or river zone regulations of DDA also state that recreational activity with construction not exceeding 0.5% of the area (with the permission of competent authority) will be allowed.Environmentalists fear that the Navbharat Udyan (or New India garden) could be detrimental to the Yamuna floodplain and also make the structures being built unstable because of the floodplain topography.As per the design brief available on CPWD’s website, the iconic structure can be maximum 134m in height. This is the Airport Authority of India’s height restriction in the area.In its design brief, the CPWD has cited locational constraints that participants should keep in mind while proposing the design. “It will be located on the western bank of river Yamuna. Hence, the foundation is to be sited in sandy soil with high water table.”Madhav Raman, architect and member of LokPath (a citizens’ collective), said the ambitious public project is risky, as the structure will be unstable due to soil liquefaction.“Like other rivers, Yamuna is exposed to climate change. Any construction on the floodplain is not safe and is prone to flooding. The site where this garden is proposed is in Zone O and is the narrowest stretch of the river in Delhi. The area is bound to get flooded during monsoon. The proposed garden is being developed as a public space and will see a footfall. Safety of public and public assets should be assessed before taking up such projects.”A senior CWPD official said, “CPWD will take all permissions. Maximum height mentioned as 134m, is as per the height allowed by AAI.”Interestingly, DDA has proposed to delineate Zone ‘O’ in the Master Plan of Delhi-2041. “In case of Yamuna, the delineation shall include its once-in-25 year floodplain or any other criteria mandated by a competent authority,” read the provision in MPD-2041.Zone ‘O’ has been split in two parts: river zone (active floodplain) and riverfront (regulated). The river zone is spread over 6295 hectares, while the regulated riverfront is 3,638 hectare in size. The plan remains a draft.“There are two issues that need to be understood. One is that DDA has its own floodplain restoration plans. It is planning to develop a biodiversity park which will stretch between the CWG village embankment and the Ring Road. In the west bank of Yamuna the CPWD is developing the Nav Bharat Udyan and in that garden they are planning to build an iconic structure. This entire area being developed by DDA and CPWD falls in zone ‘O’. No construction is permitted in zone ‘O’ as per the NGT judgement of 2015 and the current zonal regulations. We have raised objections to both what DDA and CPWD are doing. The NGT judgement is clear that nothing can be done on the floodplains without the permission of the NGT’s principal committee’s expert body. Also, Yamuna bank is part of the Ganga system. So, such constructions will be violation of the Ganga notification also,” said Manoj Mishra, convenor, Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan and petitioner in the Yamuna floodplain restoration case in NGT.As for DDA’s claim that the location does not fall in the floodplain, Mishra added that this is according to MPD 2041, which is a draft and “has no legal validity.”The DDA, which has put the draft plan in public domain, is aiming at notifying the draft MPD-2041 by year end, said a senior DDA official.A CPWD official said that they are in the process of finalising the design of the structure. “It is a government project and all necessary permissions will be taken before the construction work starts,” said a CPWD official.Raman added that MPD-2041 shows an overlap. “The same area is shown as a floodplain and also as a recreational space. In recreational space, you can construct a lot of things. The Yamuna, sadly, doesn’t flood according to the DDA’s zoning.”Experts also point to other recent constructions and events that NGT came down on. “NGT directed last year that the Millennium bus depot on the floodplains be shifted because it was an encroachment of the floodplain; NGT also made certain very strong observations about the Art of Living cultural event on Yamuna floodplains in 2016 because it involved levelling and temporary constructions. How can these constructions be allowed now?” asked Rahul Choudhary, an environmental lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/structure-at-new-india-garden-may-hit-green-hurdle-experts-101628454772575.html

While the ceiling on public gatherings was relaxed, district officials have been asked to ensure that Covid-appropriate behaviour is followed. An order issued by the Jammu and Kashmir State Executive Committee and chief secretary Arun Kumar Mehta said that while the maximum number of people permitted to attend any indoor or outdoor gathering shall remain restricted to 25. This ceiling “will be temporarily relaxed on August 15 only on account of Independence Day celebrations, subject to Covid-appropriate behaviour. ” The order added that night curfew will continue to remain in force in all the districts from 8pm to 7am.Though Covid cases in J&K continue to remain low, there has been a slight increase in daily cases, which had pushed the active cases over 1,400 on August 7 from a low of around 1,100 on July 27. This week, the daily cases have mostly hovered between 118 and 150, which is an increase from a low of 63 recorded on July 23. The order also said that Covid-containment measures should be continued in all the districts “in view of the uneven trend in daily cases”. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ceiling-on-gatherings-eased-in-j-k-to-facilitate-i-day-celebrations-101628452811862.html

As many as 95 clusters were chosen randomly in the state with each cluster consisting of 30 random houses. Vaccine hesitancy was highest among those who were above the age of 60, with 27.6% in the age group hesitant to take the jab, followed by those in the 18-45 age category with 16.9% hesitant and in the 45-60 age category with 18.2%. The number of people who were surveyed in each of these three categories were 488, 1596, and 771 respectively. The survey covered a cross section of people including professionals, unemployed, students, illiterate and those who are retired. About 2,855 people were surveyed and vaccine hesitancy was observed in 19.7% men and 18.4% of women. “This number is enough to conduct a rapid assessment to understand the problem of decision making,” said Dr K Kolandaswamy, former director of DPH. “The survey has shown what we have come to know anecdotally that there is vaccine hesitancy among the elderly, pregnant and lactating women.” Pregnant and lactating women were also included in the survey.Among those who were not yet vaccinated, 80.3% of males and 81.6% of females were ready to get inoculated, according to the survey released on Sunday. Vaccine hesitancy was higher among rural respondents (20.3%) compared to urban areas (17.5%). According to the survey, reasons for vaccine hesitancy were manifold among the respondents who were both vaccinated and had not taken it, the top reasons including fear of injections, fear of complications, confidence that they will not contract SARS-COV-2, being turned away due to short supply of vaccines and not being aware of where to get the jab.Based on the survey results, the public health department has decided to focus on awareness activities to address the misconceptions regarding Covid19 vaccine with special attention for people above 60 years. Strategies would be chalked out to counter the barriers. “The survey has shown us that we need to create a supply that is closer to their homes,” said Dr T S Selvavinayagam, director public health, who led the survey. “Most of these problems are easily addressable but the real challenge for us is the supply now.” He added that another survey will be conducted only if their performance in addressing hesitancy doesn’t work.The survey teams at each district were constituted and led by the respective deputy director of health services, while in Chennai, the survey was carried out by community medicine postgraduate students from Madras Medical College with support from Greater Chennai Corporation.“They visited houses and one family member was chosen randomly from each house. They were interviewed to understand their perception towards Covid19 vaccine, after verifying their vaccination status,” said a statement from the DPH.If the participant was vaccinated, the reason for their acceptance of the vaccine and getting vaccinated was recorded. If the participant was yet to be vaccinated, the reasons for not getting vaccinated and their willingness to get vaccinated in future was also recorded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tn-survey-shows-vaccines-hesitancy-highest-among-elderly-101628452573333.html

The BJP replaced Yediyurappa with Basavaraj Bommai, a Lingayat, to contain the resentment in the community.Three ministers from scheduled castes (SC) and one from the scheduled tribe (ST) have been inducted into the Bommai cabinet. On Thursday, the BJP inducted N Mahesh, a Dalit activist and the sole legislator of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) from Kollegala in Chamarajanagar, into the party fold, indicating its resolve to get the backing of the marginalised communities in the state.The three ministers from SC communities are Govind Karjol, who was a deputy chief minister in Yediyurappa’s cabinet, Prabhu Chauhan and S Angara. B Sriramulu is from the Valmiki community, classified as an ST.Despite the dropping of Arvind Limbavali from the Bovi community, the BJP is attempting to approach backward groups to join its fold as a way to undercut the Congress and retain power on its own in 2023.In Karnataka’s caste-centric politics, it is not uncommon for communities to back a leader or a party en masse, experts say.Analyses of voting patterns indicate that Dalits largely back the Congress or some Left parties. The BJP enjoys the backing of Lingayats and Brahmins, while the Vokkaligas, another dominant community, are largely seen to back former prime minister HD Deve Gowda-led Janata Dal (Secular). “The joining of Mahesh is an indication that the SC/ST communities want to come over to the BJP in a big way,” Yediyurappa said on Thursday. Though Yediyurappa was forced to step down last week, the 78-year-old remains the face of the BJP in Karnataka and has a high degree of acceptability across communities unlike his peers.The Narendra Modi-led central government also inducted A Narayanaswamy, a Dalit and member of parliament from Chitradurga, into the union cabinet.The move to get the backing of marginalised communities in Karnataka is to undercut the Congress, particularly Siddaramaiah, who had stormed into power in 2013 on the back of AHINDA (Kannada acronym for minorities, backward classes and Dalits).The BJP is also looking at making inroads in the Old-Mysuru region, where its presence is limited to Bengaluru and a few isolated seats.On Friday, V Srinivas Prasad, the BJP member of Parliament from Chamarajanagar, decided that he would not contest the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Prasad, a prominent Dalit activist and former confidant of Siddaramaiah, had joined the BJP after he was shunted out of the Congress cabinet in 2017. In 2018, just before the Karnataka assembly elections, then national president and present union home minister Amit Shah had visited the Madara Channaiah Guru Peetha, a spiritual headquarters of the backward Madiga community, in a bid to get the backing of groups that had traditionally sided with the Congress.The BJP is also trying to blur caste lines to get the backing of backward communities. Analysts say induction of seven ministers from backward communities in Bommai’s cabinet is a move in that direction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-tries-to-woo-dalits-backwards-to-bolster-poll-chances-in-2023-101628452512231.html

We have to watch for another two weeks to see if the numbers remain the same or if there is movement,” Dr CN Manjunath, cardiologist and director of Sri Jayadeva. Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research said.Manjunath, who is also part of the state’s technical advisory committee (TAC), added that the committee has decided to monitor the situation for the next two weeks before they take any further decisions.The Basavaraj Bommai government has already placed weekend restrictions in all districts bordering Kerala and Maharashtra, besides a state-wide night curfew.“The whole objective is to remind people that corona is very much alive and it is to sensitise the community and ensure they do not get complacent,” he added.Though Karnataka has blamed neighbouring Kerala and Maharashtra for its surge; but has looked the other way when it comes to the blatant disregard for masks, social distancing and avoiding crowds in Bengaluru, which houses almost a quarter of the state’s population.The vaccination numbers too have seen a decline, which officials said will be fixed as and when the supplies come in.“It is a dynamic situation where stocks are replenished every few days,” said a senior health department official, requesting not to be named.Karnataka has so far administered 3,29,18,047 doses of Covid-19 vaccines of which the first and second dose account for 2,55,84,606 and 73,33,441 respectively. The state had administered 1,41,530 doses on Sunday till 7.30 pm, according to data on CoWin.The vaccination coverage is nowhere near the state’s own targets of getting the entire eligible population at least one dose of vaccine by the end of December.At the moment, Karnataka’s full coverage (persons who have received both doses) is around 10% of the state’s over 70 million population, data shows.Since the beginning of August, Karnataka has administered 2,310,702 doses of Covid-19 vaccines but most of this in Bengaluru and paid vaccination.In the coffee growing district of Kodagu, about 225 kms from Bengaluru, people have often been sent back after long hours of waiting due to shortage of vaccines.Similar scenes are witnessed in other parts of Karnataka.Bengaluru has 159 micro containment zones, with areas like Mahadevapura showing a sharp spike in new cases. The positivity rate is 0.62% and the case fatality rate is 1.24% for the past week, data shows.There are 99 wards that have over 10 cases and the recovery rate is 98.02%.However, experts said that the number of hospital admissions have not gone up by much. The three day moving average for hospital admissions in Bengaluru is around 17, according to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-cases-rise-recoveries-drop-in-bengaluru-karnataka-101628452331876.html
09-08-2021||Bangalore||Yediyurappa asks Bommai to take back cabinet rank||Former Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Sunday requested that all Cabinet privileges that was accorded to him by his successor, Basvaraj Bommai, be taken back after the move triggered a controversy in the state.Yediyurappa wrote to Bommai on Sunday, asking the latter only to give the same privileges accorded to his predecessors and not any equivalent to the cabinet rank.“I request you to provide me only those facilities that are given to an immediate former chief minister and withdraw the order giving me a Cabinet rank,” Yediyurappa said in his letter to Bommai on Sunday.The controversy erupted on Saturday after Bommai, a known loyalist of Yediyurappa, asked that the latter be given all privileges of a Cabinet rank minister even though the 78-year-old is just a legislator after stepping down from the top post on July 26.“They have given Yediyurappa a Cabinet rank. On one side they talk about austerity measures, reduce expenditure, committed expenditure is 102%. They (government) say that it has become difficult to pay interest, salaries, pensions and subsidies and on the other hand they are doing this,” Siddaramaiah, former chief minister and leader of the opposition said.He, however, said that it was a good thing that Yediyurappa was giving up the Cabinet rank, which has never been accorded to anyone who has held the position in Karnataka before.Bommai has tried to show his loyalty to Yediyurappa in more ways than one and meets the latter on a regular basis, indicating that the 78-year-old continues to remain in charge of the functioning of the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/yediyurappa-asks-bommai-to-take-back-cabinet-rank-101628452151807.html
09-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: The travails of former home minister Anil Deshmukh||When the Enforcement Directorate (ED) summoned Anil Deshmukh for the fourth time last week, the 71-year-old former home minister of Maharashtra sent a letter to their Ballad Pier office instead. “I am more than eager to associate with the purported enquiry/investigations being carried out by your office so as to lay bare the hollowness, falsity and lack of substance therein,” his letter, sent through his legal representative, read. He went on: “lt appears that the summons has been issued solely with an aim to create a prejudice so as to either serve the media or sensationalise the matter before the (Supreme) Court by alleging purported non-compliance thereof by me.” “The matter before the court” which Deshmukh referred to, was the petition that he had filed on July 5, seeking a stay on his arrest by the ED, which has been probing allegations of corruption raised by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh. According to the ED, there was merit to Singh’s allegation that Deshmukh ran an extortion ring. As per a remand application filed by the anti-laundering investigation agency, Deshmukh used paper companies to route money collected from Mumbai bar owners as donations to an educational trust. The court had posted the hearing of Deshmukh’s petition to August 3, but the matter was adjourned. Deshmukh is clear: he isn’t going to attend any summons till the top court hears his petition. Meanwhile, on August 6, the ED conducted fresh raids on engineering college Nagpur Institute of Technology run by Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha, a trust that is headed by Deshmukh. This raid followed two others in the past two months conducted in properties associated with the politician. What are the allegations against Deshmukh – a Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) politician who had to resign from his state cabinet post – and what has been its political fallout for the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition of which the NCP is part? To answer this, one must return to a crime scene, its first investigating officer, a heated discussion in the state assembly, and the transfer of Mumbai’s top cop a week later on March 17. A cop and a bomb scare On February 25, the Gamdevi police station received a call. A Scorpio had been found abandoned outside businessman Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence, Antilia, and its number plate was incorrect – the registration number actually belonged to a car in the billionaire’s security detail. Soon Carmichael Street was filled with policemen. The Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad discovered 20 sticks of gelatin – but no detonator or timer – in a bag in the SUV along with a crudely worded threatening note. As the case began to attract attention, Deshmukh, the then home minister, announced that assistant inspector Sachin Vaze who led the Crime Investigation Unit of the Mumbai crime branch would be leading the investigation. Within days, however, the state’s anti-terrorism squad (ATS) joined the investigation. And then, on March 5, the body of Mansukh Hiran, a Thane businessman, washed up at a creek in Thane, which turned the investigation on its head. The SUV parked outside Antilia had belonged to Hiran, who had reported it stolen on February 18. On March 9, former chief minister and leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis raised the matter in the Assembly. Holding Call Details Record in his hands, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader pointed out that Hiran and Sachin Vaze were closely associated and asked that the state probe Vaze’s involvement in Hiran’s death. He based his claims on the statement that Hiran’s wife had given to the ATS, which had taken over the probe into Hiran’s death. She had told them that she suspected Vaze might have had a role to play in her husband’s death. Things happened quickly after this admission. Vaze was removed from the case, transferred out of the CIU, and called for questioning by the National Investigation Authority (NIA) which was handed over the investigation by the Union home ministry on March 8. Vaze, who joined the police force in 1990 as a sub inspector, has a chequered past. He attained notoriety and fame as an encounter specialist in the 90s and 2000s. In 2004, he was suspended pending investigation for his alleged involvement in the custodial killing of purported terror suspect Khwaja Yunus. Three years later, he resigned and briefly joined the Shiv Sena before starting a business. In June 2020, Param Bir Singh reinstated him to make up for a shortfall of police personnel in the pandemic.Singh, a 1988-batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer was appointed as Mumbai’s police commissioner on February 29, 2020. On March 13, Vaze was arrested for masterminding the bomb scare. An NIA official told HT that Vaze did so to regain his “lost glory”. Vaze, who is currently in custody, denied all charges. An explosive letter By mid-March, the lead investigator in the Antilia bomb scare case was now the prime accused in it. A state agency was also probing his role in Hiran’s murder. During its investigation, the NIA discovered police vehicles that were purportedly used in the commission of the crime. Amid sharp attack by the Opposition, the Maharashtra government transferred Singh on March 17, who was deputed as Commandant, Maharashtra Home Guards while Hemant Nagrale took over as the city’s police commissioner. It was presented as a routine transfer, and not as a fallout to the Antilia and Hiran murder probes. Yet, a day later, Deshmukh said at an event organised by a media channel: “The transfer of the Mumbai commissioner was to ensure that the ongoing probe by the National Investigation Agency and the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) is not hampered.” Singh’s reaction was swift. On March 20, he shot off a letter to the Governor of Maharashtra, the chief minister and senior bureaucrats, levelling serious allegations of corruption against Deshmukh. Singh alleged that Deshmukh summoned Mumbai Police officers including the then deputy commissioner of police (enforcement) Raju Bhujbal, assistant commissioner of police Sanjay Patil (social service branch) and Vaze and gave them a target of ₹100 crore, which was to be collected each month from dance bars, hookah parlours and bars and restaurants in Mumbai. Deshmukh strongly denied all charges levied against him. The NCP too stood behind him: party supremo Sharad Pawar held press conferences to clarify that the allegations were “incorrect” and the party would not seek his resignation. Singh did not stop at the letter. He moved the Supreme Court on March 23, seeking an impartial probe by an independent agency like the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The Apex court, however, refused to entertain the plea and asked him to approach the Bombay HC. Others like advocate Jayashri Patil joined Singh in petitioning for a CBI probe. On April 5, the HC ordered CBI to undertake a preliminary enquiry to ascertain if there was any substance in the allegations. In a strongly worded judgment, the court noted: “There can be no independent probe if it is given to the police where Deshmukh is the home minister. The interest of justice will be done if the director of CBI is allowed to conduct a preliminary inquiry. Such an inquiry be conducted in accordance with law and be concluded within 15 days. Once the preliminary inquiry is complete, it will be at the discretion of director CBI to decide on the further course of action.” The same day Deshmukh resigned. He also moved the SC against this order. Two investigations If a central agency probes a sitting minister based on allegations, what would that hold out for the stability of the state government: this was the question at the heart of Deshmukh’s plea. He sought an immediate stay on the order stating that a preliminary inquiry by the CBI would lead to irreparable loss to his reputation. He also maintained that the HC order ignored that there was no substantial evidence in the allegations made by Singh. Pointing out that the CBI is a Central government agency, he argued that if the court accepted statements without substantive evidence then this could pave the way to destabilise state governments in future. The Maharashtra government too filed a petition arguing that the high court bypassed the investigation agencies in the state and showed no confidence in the Mumbai Police, which affected their morale. Both the petitions were rejected by the Apex court on April 8. CBI conducted a preliminary enquiry and registered a First Information Report on April 21 against Deshmukh and others for “attempting to obtain undue advantage for improper and dishonest performance of duty.” The agency also carried out searches at Deshmukh’s residence in Mumbai and Nagpur. On May 3, Deshmukh moved the Bombay HC to quash the CBI’s FIR contending that it was registered without the consent of the state government, as mandated by the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 and without prior approval as required under section 17C of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The HC dismissed the petition on July 22. Deshmukh’s lawyer Kamlesh Ghumre refused to comment on the HC order. And while there has been no further movement on the CBI probe since then, another investigation was initiated against Deshmukh. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on May 11 registered an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) against the NCP leader to probe the money laundering aspects of the case. ED officials recorded statements of hoteliers and orchestra bar owners from Mumbai. They even recorded former assistant inspector Sachin Vaze’s statements twice in May. On June 26, the agency arrested Deshmukh’s personal secretary Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde, claiming that they had accepted money collected by Vaze from some bar owners. The two were booked under various provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Deshmukh moved the Supreme Court on July 5 questioning the agency’s probe and repeated summons issued to him and his son. The NCP leader has also sought orders restraining the agency from taking any coercive steps against him – this is the case that is before the Supreme Court. Following the paper trailAccording to the ED, Vaze who is lodged in Taloja jail in connection with his role in the Antilia bomb scare and Hiran murder case, disclosed that he had collected ₹4.7 crore from bar owners for “smooth functioning of bars” and handed the money to Shinde in two installments in January and February 2021. “On behalf of 60 bar owners, Shri Jaya Poojari and Shri Mahesh Shetty, bar owner/ manager had paid ₹40 lakh to Sachin Vaze in December 2020 as ‘good luck’ money,” ED had said in one of its the remand applications. Subsequent to Vaze’s meetings with bar owners, “in January and February 2021, orchestra bar owners from Zone I to Zone VII of Mumbai police paid sum of ₹1.64 crore to Vaze and orchestra bars owners from Zone VIII to Zone XII paid him ₹2.66 crore during this period.” ED claimed that while collecting money from bar owners, Vaze told them that part of the money was to go to “No.1”, whom ED officials suspect referred to the then home minister. The agency also claimed that Deshmukh had used shell companies to route the money as donations to an educational trust headed by Deshmukh which runs engineering and polytechnic colleges in Nagpur. The money, according to ED, was first sent to a Delhi-based sibling duo, known as the Jain brothers who reportedly created shell companies to house cash received as donations to Nagpur-based Shri Sai Shikshan Sansthan, a trust controlled by Deshmukh and his family. Both Deshmukh’s son, Hrishikesh and personal assistant, Shinde are associated with the trust.The ED contended that they identified 24 private entities controlled by Deshmukh family -- directly and indirectly -- and found that huge sums of money had moved among them without any rationale.“From the analysis of the bank accounts of these companies, it is clear that there is no rationale for the transfers and can thus be said that these series of transactions were meant for inflating balance sheets and layering of money from one company to other,” ED had said in the remand application submitted to the special PMLA court. In July, the anti-money laundering agency provisionally attached Deshmukh’s properties worth ₹4.20 crore, including the NCP leader’s flat at Worli valued at about ₹1.54 crore and 25 land parcels Dhutum village in Uran-- held in the name of Deshmukh’s wife Aarti and a company named Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd – with a book value of ₹2.67 crore.According to ED officers, Deshmukh acquired 50% ownership in M/s Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd including its assets, i.e. land and shops, “totally valued at approximately ₹5.34 crore (book value) by merely paying ₹17.95 lakh, that too after a substantial gap.”ED has issued summons to Deshmukh and Hrishikesh and claimed that the father-son duo has not honoured any of the summons yet. Deshmukh’s lawyer, Kamlesh Ghumre however visited the agency’s office as Deshmukh’s representative. Political battlefield NCP leaders believe that the allegations against Deshmukh are part of the efforts of the Opposition party, which is in power in the Centre, to defame the state coalition government, which also comprises the Shiv Sena and Congress. NCP national spokesperson Nawab Malik maintained that the charges against Deshmukh are politically motivated. “The allegations made by Param Bir Singh against Anil Deshmukh ji are baseless. They were made only after Singh was transferred out from his position as Mumbai commissioner of police. The BJP is misusing central agencies to create trouble for Deshmukh but we are hopeful that he will get justice from the judiciary. NCP is with Deshmukh in these testing times,” Malik said. “Even if the NCP decides not to back Deshmukh, this vindictive politics of the BJP will not end with him as they want to target other senior MVA leaders to defame the state government,” said another senior NCP minister who did not wish to be named. “In the beginning, Deshmukh promised to cooperate with the central agencies in the probe but did not do so. He also approached courts at times but did not get any relief thus far,” BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said. Political analyst Hemant Desai said the political fight may end up being more posturing than anything else. “It will be difficult for the investigation agency to prove Deshmukh’s direct involvement in the extortion accusations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-the-travails-of-former-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-101628452091925.html
09-08-2021||Chandigarh||Kullu scuffle: IPS Gaurav, CM’s PSO Balwant reinstated||The suspension of IPS officer Gaurav Singh and the chief minister’s personal security officer Balwant Singh, who were involved in an ugly scuffle during the visit of Union minister Nitin Gadkari to Kullu in June, has been revoked. Gaurav’s reinstatement order was issued by the home department while Balwant’s services were restored by the director general of police. They will report to the Shimla DGP’s office till they receive their new posting. What had happened? The incident took place on June 23 when Gadkari arrived on a tour to Kullu. Gaurav, who was then the Kullu superintendent of police (SP) had allowed people affected by the Chandigarh-Manali four-laning project to protest peacefully at the Bhunter airport. The Union minister met the protesters and listened to their grievances. However, this did not go down well with the chief minister who pointed it out to his additional superintendent of police of his security detail, Brijesh Sood.Sood raised the matter with Gaurav, which led to a heated verbal exchange. However, things turned ugly when Singh slapped Sood. Seeing this, the chief minister’s PSO Balwant Singh kicked the IPS officer. The entire incident was caught on camera and shared widely on social media, prompting state police chief Sanjay Kundu to remove all three from their duties and order an inquiry.Gaurav and Balwant were suspended, while Sood was attached to the police headquarters, only to be reinstated after 10 days.In the probe that followed, Gaurav said that Sood had abused him and made last-minute changes in the motorcade in violation of the security protocol. Sood refuted the allegations and maintained that his concern was the CM’s security. Balwant said he lost temper when the IPS officer slapped his boss.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kullu-scuffle-ips-gaurav-cm-s-pso-balwant-reinstated-101628452031777.html

09-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh residents complain of inflated water bills||Even after the Chandigarh administration stayed the hike in water tariff, many residents complain they continue to get high water bills. According to Gursewak Singh Brar, a resident of Sector 8, he received an “unreasonable” bill of ₹9,000 for two months, and he ended up clearing it for the fear of late payment charges. “The only response I got after complaining to the municipal officials was that there is nothing they could do about it,” he said.Baljinder Singh Bittu, chairman, Federation of Sector Welfare Associations, Chandigarh, said residents who were getting bills amounting to ₹500 earlier are now being charged ₹3,000. “It seems the MC staff has randomly put the charges on bills without checking the meters. We have made several complaints, but nobody bothers,” he said, adding that the federation is considering to take legal recourse.The Chandigarh administration in May notified a stay on the hiked water tariff, putting off the increased charges till the next fiscal in view of the pandemic. It was in September 2020 that it had notified up to 200% hike in water tariff, which led to a public outcry and criticism from the opposition. The MC General House had even passed resolutions, asking the administration to roll back the hike. Vinod Vashisht, convener, City Forum of Residents Welfare Organisations, said: “Residents’ miseries are not going to end as the administration has already notified to restart the hike in water tariff from April 2022. It seems in the absence of a strong opposition in the MC House, the ruling dispensation has lost all empathy for its citizens.”The municipal corporation, on its part, claims that all complaints regarding the high charges have been addressed. “In most cases, the inflated bills were due to internal leakages at the consumer’s end. In cases where it was observed that the meter readings were taken wrongly, we have rectified the bills,” said Narinder Pal Sharma, MC chief engineer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-residents-complain-of-inflated-water-bills-101628451851754.html

09-08-2021||Chandigarh||Manimahesh Yatra called off this year too||The annual Manimahesh pilgrimage will only be carried out symbolically for the second year in a row with the priest and a handful of devotees performing the rituals subject to a negative RT-PCR test. The 14-day pilgrimage to the glacier-fed Manimahesh Lake in the tribal Bharmour subdivision of Chamba is scheduled to start on August 29, coinciding with Janmashtmi, the festival celebrating the birth of Lord Krishna. It will conclude on September 12, on the occasion of Radhaashtmi (the birthday of Lord Krishna’s consort Radha).Chamba deputy commissioner DC Rana says, “A priest will perform the rituals at the lake provided that a RT-PCR test carried out within 72 hours returns negative. The rituals will be limited and only 25 people will be allowed at the chhari yatra (mace procession).” “The number of devotees coming to the district with mace processions from Bhaderwah of Jammu-Kashmir will also be limited,” the DC said , adding that a negative RT-PCR report is also mandatory for those participating in the mace procession.Police check posts will be set up at all entry points to the district to stop pilgrims coming from other states.Every year, lakhs of pilgrims trek to the oval-shaped lake, located at a height of 13,500ft above the sea level, to catch a glimpse of Mount Kailash, believed to be the abode of Lord Shiva, and offer prayers.The uphill journey starts from Hadsar, a small hamlet, which is about 12km from Bharmour town, and is considered as arduous as the trek to the Amarnath cave shrine in Jammu and Kashmir.Lord Shiva is the presiding deity of this Yatra. A rock formation in the shape of a Shivling on Kailash is considered to be the manifestation of Lord Shiva. Mount Kailash is considered to be invincible. No one so far has been able to scale the peak. Lore has it that devotees are only able to catch a glimpse of the peak if the Lord is pleased. The Shrikhand Yatra of Kullu, Kinner Kailash Yatra of Kinnaur and Minjar Fair of Chamba were also cancelled due to the pandemic this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/manimahesh-yatra-called-off-this-year-too-101628451071851.html

09-08-2021||Chandigarh||5 years on, Punjab’s first solid waste management plant yet to run to capacity||Punjab’s first solid waste management plant in Bathinda is still to run to its full capacity even as it has been five years since it started operations as a cluster model to be replicated across the state to address the problem of processing municipal waste. Managed by Delhi-based Jindal Infrastructure Transportation and Fabrication (JITF), the plant was to generate electricity and produce manure from the municipal waste. But since the waste from 17 urban local bodies (other than Bathinda) was not transported to the processing site, the plant never ran at its full capacity since 2016. The project under the public-private partnership (PPP) mode was designed to manage 350 tonnes of municipal waste every day from the cluster of 18 urban local bodies of southern Punjab districts of Mansa, Muktsar and Fazilka besides Bathinda.But the project, conceived and executed by the previous Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party (SAD-BJP) government, ran into rough weather after the promoter and the Bathinda municipal corporation got entangled in arbitration in 2019 over claims for its poor working.JITF director VS Luthra was unavailable for comments.Company officials said their main contention was non-payment of tipping fee by the MC for collection of garbage and non-availability of additional land for the second phase of the sanitary landfill site. “The firm demanded ₹758 crore from the municipality for causing it a loss due to non-execution of work and investment of ₹100 crore in machinery,” said an official. The civic body, on the other hand, has sought damages of ₹872 crore from the company for its alleged inability to run the plant as per agreement. MC superintending engineer HS Bhullar said a three-member panel of arbitrators heard the matter last on April 20 this year and the next date is yet to be announced. “The civic body is collecting about 120 tonnes of waste and transporting it to the processing site daily. It is the duty of the JITF to collect the waste from rest of the municipal bodies. In the absence of sufficient material, JITF has failed to start the waste-to-energy project,” said Bhullar.Officials said when the project was initiated in 2011, it faced opposition from the residents of the areas around the project site. “For more than three decades, a large open space on the Bathinda-Mansa road was used for dumping waste. When the administration initiated a scientific disposal project, a section of people opposed the project, claiming that the method was hazardous. The construction work started only in 2015 after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) gave it a clearance,” said the source.Following an agitation in the run-up to the last assembly elections, Manpreet Badal (now finance minister) had announced to shift the plant to a new site. But the MC took no step in the last four-and-a-half years to find an alternate project site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/5-years-on-punjab-s-first-solid-waste-management-plant-yet-to-run-to-capacity-101628450894568.html
09-08-2021||Chandigarh||Registration of voters for SGPC elections to start in 2 weeks||The registration of voters for the long-pending Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) general house elections is set to start within two weeks, gurdwara elections chief commissioner Justice (retd) SS Saron said. “We will address the demands raised by individuals and organisations. For example, there is demand for reducing the voter age limit from 21 to 18. After going through these demands, we will send our recommendations to the Union government for approval. We will ask the deputy commissioners to review pro formas for voter registration and update them,” he said.About the poll schedule, he said, “That is the prerogative of the Centre under the Sikh Gurdwara Act, 1925.” Saron, who was appointed the chief commissioner in October 2020, added, “The Covid-19 outbreak delayed the election process. Also, we cannot update the electoral rolls. We have to look into the process in light of the new legislation which barred sehajdhari Sikhs (Sikhs with shorn hair) from voting. We will also have to enroll more voters if the age limit is relaxed. It is a long process and a lot of work will have to be done before polling.” Also, the chief commissioner will have to look into the two court cases — one related to challenging the enactment of a separate committee for management of gurdwaras by the Haryana government and other of the sehajdhari Sikh voting rights issue. The cases are pending in the Supreme Court and the Punjab and Haryana High Court.It has been 10 years since the elections were held due to a dispute over voting rights to the sehajdhari Sikhs. Of a total of 191 members of the SGPC general house, 170 members are elected by the adult Sikhs with ballot papers. Fifteen are nominated to the house as co-opted members. In December 2011, the Punjab and Haryana High Court had nullified the polls as it restored the voting rights of sehajdhari Sikhs by quashing the 2003 notification of the central government. Based on that notification, sehajdhari Sikhs were not allowed to vote in the 2011 gurdwara body elections, but the court in a hearing made it clear that the poll results would be subject to the verdict in the sehajdhari voting rights case.In February 2012, the SGPC moved the Supreme Court challenging the HC order. In 2016, the apex court while reinstating the 2011 SGPC House referred to an amendment by Parliament where the Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925, was amended to deny voting rights to sehajdhari Sikhs with retrospective effect from 2003. The SGPC manages historic gurdwaras in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/registration-of-voters-for-sgpc-elections-to-start-in-2-weeks-101628450891764.html

However, the matter was referred to NIC, Haryana and it was informed that the uploading of fancy numbers on the portals concerned can only be done by using state admin user id and RTO cannot add any series on its own.“It is requested that an FIR may be registered in the matter regarding uploading of preferential marks under series HR06AY and HR60L by the said registering authorities beyond jurisdiction,” reads the complaint .Samalkha SDM Vijender Hooda said, “I will have to go through the complaint to give any details on this issue, but I can tell that the state transport commissioner is the competent authority to issue the registration marks from 0001 to 0100 and the district and SDM offices could allot registration marks from 0101 to 9999 of the same series on the portal.”As per officials, these fancy numbers are paid and buyers have to deposit a fixed fee to get these numbers on their vehicles. Panipat SP Shashank Kumar Sawan said the FIR has been registered under sections 420 and 409 of the IPC and Section 66 D of the IT Act.When asked if the police could approach the people to whom these numbers were allotted, the SP said that any information in this regard will be provided only after the investigation is completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/seven-car-vanity-numbers-allotted-illegally-in-panipat-fir-registered-101628450773862.html

09-08-2021||Chandigarh||Bishnoi gang vows to avenge Youth Akali leader’s murder||A day after Youth Akali Dal leader Vikramjit Singh Middukhera, aka Vicky Middukhera, 33, was shot dead in broad daylight in Sector 71, Mohali, on Saturday, the Lawrence Bishnoi gang reportedly vowed to avenge his death.Hours after the murder on Saturday, the rival Davinder Bambiha gang had taken responsibility for the attack in a Facebook post. It claimed that Vicky was killed as he was allegedly acting as an “informer” for the Bishnoi gang. On Sunday, a Facebook page purportedly run by the Bishnoi gang posted a message, pledging to take revenge for Vicky’s death. The post in Hindi says that Vicky Middukhera was “our brother and had nothing to do with criminal activities”. According to a senior police officer privy to the investigations, Vicky had for long been on the hit list of gangsters, owing to his support to Bishnoi since their days in student politics as both were at one point affiliated to the Students Organisation of Panjab University. Both Bambiha and Bishnoi gangs are running extortion racket in the region. Bishnoi is calling the shots from behind bars while Gaurav Patial, alias Lucky, is running the Bambiha gang from abroad.According to senior superintendent of police (SSP), Mohali, Satinder Singh, who is heading the investigations, Lucky, who is from Khuda Lahora in Chandigarh, is the main suspect. “He is at present in Armenia,” he said. Lucky was an aide of the slain gangster Davinder Bambiha, and according to sources he is running the gang after another aide, Dilpreet Singh Dahan, was arrested in a police encounter in Chandigarh three years ago.Lucky’s name had earlier cropped up in the murder of Gurlal Brar, an aide of Bishnoi who was shot dead outside a nightclub in Chandigarh last year. A day before Vicky’s murder, police in the neighbouring Panchkula district had also arrested two sharp shooters of the Bambiha gang, who were allegedly planning to eliminate Bishnoi gang members.Vicky sustained 12 bullet injuriesAccording to Vicky’s postmortem, he had sustained 12 bullet injuries. The postmortem was conducted by a three-member panel of doctors led by Dr Charanpreet Kaur at the civil hospital in Phase 6.Dr Kaur said the victim sustained 12 bullet injuries, out of which 10 pierced through and two were recovered from his body. Some of the bullets were fired from point-blank range, and hit his chest, stomach and temple, she said.“The victim died within minutes of the attack as his liver and lungs were ruptured,” said the doctor.According to the CCTV footage and eyewitness account, the four assailants had come in a white Hyundai i20 car and were waiting for Vicky who was visiting a property dealer at the Mataur market in Sector 71.Two of them chased Vicky and fired at him repeatedly as he was about to sit in his SUV around 10:30am on Saturday. According to police, a .30 bore pistol was used in the crime and at least 20 rounds were fired.“We have conducted raids at eight possible hideouts, but got no lead. Based on the CCTV footage, we are trying to match the pictures of the shooters with criminals in our old records,” said SSP Satinder Singh.Also, the Mohali registration number fixed on the assailants’ car has turned out to be fake. “The car owner had put the vehicle on sale online. It seems the shooters picked up the number from there,” said the SSP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bishnoi-gang-vows-to-avenge-youth-akali-leader-s-murder-101628450231931.html

Earlier this week, Sekhri has been appointed as the chairman of the Punjab Health Systems Corporation. “The state government had floated tenders for development works that included the construction of new bridges, roads and three rest houses in Batala. Sekhri, using his influence, ensured that these tenders were cancelled,” Teja, a close aide of Punjab cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, told a press conference.“We were informed about the cancellation of the tenders by the deputy commissioner’s office,” said Teja, adding that, “Instead of acting as a roadblock, Sekhri should bring more funds from the state government for this industrial town.”Sekhri has rubbished all allegations and denied having any knowledge about any tenders. Terming the allegations as baseless, Sekhri added that he had sought ₹50 crore for laying sewerage in inner localities, and chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had assured approval to the scheme within 10 days. “I have been working in this constituency for the last 35 years and will leave no stone unturned for the development of my constituency,” Sekhri claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rift-in-batala-cong-mayor-accuses-ex-mla-of-blocking-development-101628450171645.html
09-08-2021||Chandigarh||Default in coal purchase payment: Power tribunal tells PSPCL to pay ₹500 crore to TSPL||In another blow to Power State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) has ordered it to pay ₹472 crore with interest to Talwandi Sabo Power Limited (TSPL) for default in payment for purchase of imported coal in 2017.Earlier, the PSPCL lost a case of coal washing charges and it had to pay ₹3,200 crore to private thermal plants. In the recent case, the PSPCL disallowed payment of alternative coal (imported coal) cost to be arranged by the TSPL to run the plant at full capacity during the 2017 (June to September) paddy season. Besides, the corporation also did not pay the deemed capacity charges from September 2016 to May 2017 and October 2017 onwards. The total default was around ₹478 crore. Allowing the TSPL petition, the APTEL has asked the PSPCL to pay the said amount with interest, which will be around ₹500 crore.In 2019, the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) disallowed two appeals filed by the TSPL wherein it was said the as the linked coal provided by the PSPCL is not sufficient to run the plant at full capacity, the corporation should either pay cost of imported coal or capacity charges. Flowing this, the corporation approached the APTEL.Setting aside the PSERC order, the APTEL directed the PSPCL to make the payment of differential amount as sought by the TSPL with late fee surcharge according to provisions of the power purchase agreement (PPA) from the date of billing till payments are made along with deemed capacity charges from October 2017 onwards.Officials privy to the development said poor drafting of the PPA has again gone against the PSPCL. Citing the PPA, the tribunal said it is the obligation of the corporation to arrange for the fuel for the generating station. Though the TSPL was required to pursue the matter with the ministry of coal, Mahanadi Coalfields Limited and other departments, the obligation of arranging fuel lies with the PSPCL, the tribunal said. One of the reasons for less coal supplied by Mahanadi Coalfields Limited was lesser requisition by the TSPL (from April 17, 2017 to June 10, 2017) due to force majeure, due to fire in the coal handling plant. Due to this, the TSPL was unable to send requisition of 6.9 lakh MT of coal. The APTEL said the imported coal was procured by the TSPL due the circumstances beyond its control, thus it should have been paid for it.The failure of the PSPCL to discharge its obligation affected the TSPL adversely. Hence, the TSPL is justified in claiming deemed capacity charges between September 2016 to May 2017 and October 2017 till 2018, the tribunal said. Following the tribunal order, the PSPCL has decided to challenge the tribunal order in a higher court, said an official. PSPCL chairman-cum-managing director A Venu Parsad was not available for comments. President of the PSEB Engineers’ Association Jasvir Singh Dhiman said there were serious lapses on the part of the PSPCL in executing these projects due to which the consumers of the state are suffering. The government had promised to issue a white paper on the issue, but to no avail. All India Power Engineers Federation (AIPEF) spokesman VK Gupta said that officials who drafted the PPAs should be held responsible for coal linkage issue related costs and other weak provisions of power pacts, which has led to a loss of over ₹10,000 crore to the consumers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/default-in-coal-purchase-payment-power-tribunal-tells-pspcl-to-pay-rs-500-crore-to-tspl-101628449932050.html

09-08-2021||Noida||Noida: PVVNL plans 48 sub-stations to meet rising power demand||Expecting an increase of over 30% in power demand in Gautam Budh Nagar by 2026, the Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) has decided to improve the supply infrastructure in the district. PVVNL officials said that the district needs about 50 new power sub-stations to meet the rising demand and a proposal in this regard will soon be sent to the state government. The power distribution company has also invited suggestions from people’s representatives, consumers and residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) to improve the distribution system, the officials said.According to the officials, the power demand in GB Nagar is set to increase from around 1500 megawatt (MW) per day at present to over 2000 MW per day in the next five years.PVVNL’s Noida divisional chief engineer, Virendra Nath Singh, said that the new infrastructure will cater to the power needs of the district in 2026. “Apart from Noida, the consumption of power is all set to go up in Greater Noida authority and Yamuna Expressway authority areas as several new projects are taking shape there. So, we are making a proposal for 48 new power sub-stations in these areas,” he said. Singh further said that the discom is also making a proposal for underground cabling of all the supply lines from all 33/11 kva power sub-stations. “At present, all supply lines from the 80 sub-stations are not underground. Besides, we are planning to connect all the power sub-stations with double lines. If anyone wants to give any suggestions for the betterment of present power infrastructure, they can drop their written messages in the boxes at their nearest sub-stations,” he said. The chief engineer also said that the PVVNL headquarters will send the proposal to the state government by the end of this week. “The state government will forward the proposal to the central government. Once it is cleared by the central power ministry, the overhauling work will begin. The central government will bear 60% of the total cost of overhauling the power infrastructure, while the remaining 40% expenses will be shouldered by the state government,” Singh said. It may be noted that to avert power cuts during peak hours, the PVVNL headquarters, in March 2021, had released ₹26 crore for upgradation work in GB Nagar, including the replacement of dilapidated poles, old transmission lines and open pillar boxes. “A Meerut-based agency has been awarded a contract to replace 17,500 poles, 990 air circuit breakers between transformers and low transmission power lines, and 11 kilovolt (kv) vacuum circuit breakers. The agency is also replacing 100km of 11kv wires, 80km of insulated conductor wires and 200 pillar boxes, besides taking up chemical earthing in different areas and societies of GB Nagar,” said a senior official at PVVNL’s managing director office in Meerut, preferring anonymity.

While dismissing the bunch of 12 writ petitions filed by Ritesh Kumar alias Rikki and others, a division bench comprising justices Pritinker Diwaker and Samit Gopal said, “In a petition under Article 226 (writ jurisdiction) of the Constitution of India, the high court cannot adjudicate the correctness of the allegations in the impugned first information reports or the cases on the basis of which the impugned first information reports have been lodged”. The plea of the petitioners was that they had been made accused in the impugned FIRs which had been lodged under the provisions of the Gangster Act on the basis of their involvement in a solitary case. Therefore, the impugned FIRs were illegal and against the essence of the Gangster Act. The petitioners’ counsel argued, “The said First Information Report could not have been lodged on the basis of a solitary case and as such the writ petitions should be allowed and the respective impugned FIRs should be quashed.” After hearing concerned parties, the court dismissed the bunch of petitions as it didn’t find any illegality in the FIRs registered.

09-08-2021||Noida||Four killed, 20 injured in two accidents on nearby highways||Four persons died and 20 others, including a 55-year-old woman sub-inspector of the Delhi Police, were injured in two separate accidents -- one took place on the Yamuna Expressway and the other on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway -- on Sunday.Police said that four persons were returning from Mathura to Delhi in a Honda City car when one of the front tyres got punctured near Salarpur underpass in Dankaur around 12:30pm. “The four occupants deboarded the car and one of them started replacing the tyre when a speeding vehicle coming in the same direction ran over them,” said Arvind Pathak, station house officer, Dankaur police station.According to police, all the four persons -- Bhaskar Sharma, 25, his mother Kanchan Sharma, 62, Kanchan’s younger sister Poonam Sharma, 55, and Poonam’s daughter Bhavya Sharma, 19 -- were critically wounded in the incident while the driver of the unidentified vehicle managed to escape. Some passersby informed police and a team from Dankaur police station reached the spot, Pathak said, adding that the four victims were admitted to a private hospital in Greater Noida where Bhaskar, Kanchan and Bhavya succumbed to injuries.The condition of Poonam Sharma, a sub-inspector of the Delhi Police, is critical, a senior police official said.Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said the Delhi-based family was returning after visiting temples in Mathura. “The four victims were rushed to a private hospital where three of them died. Poonam Sharma is undergoing treatment in the hospital’s intensive care unit,” he said.While Bhaskar and Kanchan were residents of Delhi’s Vikaspuri, Poonam is a resident of BSES Colony in New Delhi, police said.Police said that the three bodies have been sent for a post-mortem. “We have registered a case against unknown person under Section 304-A (death due to negligence) and Section 279 (rash driving) of the Indian Penal Code. We are scanning the footage from the CCTV camera to identify the suspect and his vehicle,” Pathak said.In the second accident, a 35-year-old woman died while 19 others were injured after a bus carrying over 60 passengers hit a stationary truck on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway in Dadri around 8am. The bus going from Punjab to Bihar was badly damaged and the passengers were trapped, officials said, adding that a police team reached the spot and rescued them.Pradeep Tripathi, SHO of Dadri police station, said the bus bearing Punjab registration number was going to Muzaffarpur. “A truck loaded with iron bars was parked on the expressway. It seems that the bus driver could not spot the truck and hit the vehicle from behind,” he said.Police said all the victims were rushed to the Noida district hospital where a woman succumbed to injuries. The woman was travelling alone and her identity has not been ascertained yet, police said.The injured were identified as Mani Lal Mathur, Bablu, Zubair Ansari, Shyam Pandit, Naresh Kumar, Milan, Sonu Kumar, Manilal, Vinod, Jitendra, Vijay, Mausam Kumar, Sunil Das, Rasool, Raj Kumar, Mehruddin, Anirudh and Vasu.Most of the injured persons are residents of Supaul, Madhepura, Muzaffarpur, and Sitamarhi of Bihar and they worked in various factories in Punjab, police said, adding that they have not received any complaint in the case.Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday offered condolences to the families of the victims who died in the accidents in Greater Noida. “CM Yogi Adityanath instructed the administration to provide proper treatment to those injured in the accidents and to provide all possible help and relief to the affected people,” the CM’s office said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/four-killed-20-injured-in-two-accidents-on-yamuna-expressway-eastern-peripheral-expressway-101628449151011.html

The media and the judiciary, the pillars of democracy, have failed to do what was expected of them during such times,” he added. He added that he was optimistic that the country will weather such challenges, as this was not the first time when the country had witnessed such a situation. “Since Independence, the country has gone through such circumstances several times and the masses have always shown the door to people responsible for it,” he claimed.In the current scenario, he claimed that the economy and Covid-19 pandemic were key challenges facing the country, but unfortunately no on had the time to discuss these issues in Parliament. “Bills are being passed without debate. It seems Parliament has been turned into cabinet meeting, where only the government will put its point of view; others would not be allowed to speak,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/democracy-being-muzzled-media-judiciary-have-to-resist-govt-s-dictatorial-attitude-sardesai-101628449031641.html

We have finalised the agency and four teams are deployed, but certain permissions are still pending. So, a complete survey has not started,” a senior official of the district administration said, wishing not to be identified. The official cited above said that while the survey has started in some parts of the Aravallis under the Sohna forest range, it was affected on Saturday due to rainfall. The official said that the survey is yet to take off in areas under the Gurugram forest range and that notices have been sent to owners of over 70 illegal structures constructed in the Aravallis.Rajeev Tejyan, divisional forest officer of Gurugram, did not respond to calls and messages on Sunday. Last Tuesday, officials decided to conduct a drone survey of 33 villages located along the Aravallis to identify illegal structures and farmhouses in protected areas. The district administration officials said after the identification of such properties, notices will be sent to the owners and demolitions will be carried out to clear the protected area. According to forest department officials, the drone survey will cover over 6,800 hectares of land protected under the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA). The action against illegal structures in the forest areas of Gurugram is being taken on the lines of Faridabad, where the Supreme Court and National Green Tribunal directed the authorities to remove illegal constructions in the Aravallis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/drone-survey-of-aravallis-delayed-due-to-pending-permissions-rain-101628447771819.html

09-08-2021||Mumbai||Extortion case: MCOCA applied to Chhota Rajan’s henchman, aides||The anti-extortion cell (AEC) of the Mumbai crime branch invoked the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against gangster Chhota Rajan’s henchman Yusuf Suleiman Kadri alias Yusuf Bachkana and two others of his gang in connection with an extortion case. The AEC has moved the proposal to joint commissioner of police (crime branch) Milind Bharambe in the last week of July. Following the proposal, all three accused Bachkana, and his two associates Habiba Khan and Prakash Kunchikurve were produced again in the sessions court and remanded in police custody till August 11. Under MCOCA, an accused cannot obtain bail easily. The trio has been arrested for threatening a Ghatkopar-based developer and demanding ₹50 lakh from him.Police claimed Bachkana was a sharp-shooter for Chhota Rajan. Later, he became close to Ravi Pujari and started allegedly making extortion calls to businessmen in Mumbai and other cities. He used to send his men to threaten businessmen on the directions of Pujari, but due to lack of evidence, was acquitted in most cases, added the officer. The case against Bachkana was filed in June for allegedly threatening and demanding ₹50 lakh from inside the Karnataka jail where Bachkana has been serving a life sentence. The AEC took his custody on a production warrant from jail and arrested Bachkana on July 20 and his two associates – Khan and Kunchikurve – for helping him.The crime branch official said they learnt that apart from the Ghatkopar developer, Bachkana had targeted two more private developers of Mumbai with the help of Khan and demanded ₹25 lakh from each of them. “We have recorded the statement of the victims and instead of registering separate cases, they have been made witness and their statements have been merged in the Ghatkopar case,” added the crime branch officer. “There are chances that many more gang members are involved and few more might be arrested in the case.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/extortion-case-mcoca-applied-to-chhota-rajan-s-henchman-aides-101628447413580.html
09-08-2021||Delhi||DMRC to develop internal road below Trilokpuri section to improve congestion||After flagging off the missing 290-metre link between Trilokpuri Sanjay Lake and Mayur Vihar Pocket 1 stations on the Pink Line, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is now working on developing a road between Vasundhara Road and Khudi Ram Bose Marg near the former station to decongest areas around the metro corridor.DMRC on Sunday said the internal road, below the Metro viaduct, will improve the flow of traffic and decongest the area.Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC, said the road will be 160 metres long and 16 metres wide (excluding the median, footpath, boundary wall, etc). Work on it is likely to be completed by October this year, said officials.“At present, even though the section is opened, the road network in the internal pockets of Trilokpuri is not maintained and this impairs last-mile connectivity with Metro stations. Our aim is to develop a multimodal system that is interconnected so that passengers are not stranded once they leave the Metro station,” a senior Metro official said.According to traffic police estimates, the stretch connecting Vasundhara Road and Khudi Ram Bose Marg, will significantly help minimise traffic woes in the internal roads in neighbouring areas.The DMRC on Friday inaugurated the 290-metre missing link between Trilokpuri-Sanjay Lake and Mayur Vihar pocket-1 on the Pink Line (connecting Majlis Park and Shiv Vihar). While the corridor was opened in 2019, this section could not be completed because of land acquisition issues. The section, which was earlier set to be opened from September last year, was delayed further because of construction restrictions and the lack of available labourers and construction material because of the Covid-19 pandemic.“DMRC has maintained a tradition of developing peripheral areas around the viaducts and tunnels which it has constructed as part of the Metro network. For example, the rotary at Mandi House was beautified and the road widened when the station was built,” the Metro said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dmrc-to-develop-internal-road-below-trilokpuri-section-to-improve-congestion-101628447412364.html
09-08-2021||Delhi||5 arrested for taking away jewels from shop by posing as CBI officials||Five people were arrested for their alleged involvement in at least three cheating cases in which they impersonated officials of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and stole gold and cash from victims in Karol Bagh between March and June, said police on Sunday.Police recovered five fake identity cards of the CBI and seven mobile phones that the suspects used in the crimes, along with three gold chains, which they allegedly stole from an employee of a jewellery shop in Karol Bagh on June 27.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Jasmeet Singh, “All five belong to a family, which had migrated from Iran to India decades ago and settled in a residential area near Bhopal railway station in Madhya Pradesh . The locality is known as Irani Mohalla and hence, the syndicate is known as ‘Irani gang’.”The arrested men were identified as Mohammad Ali alias Sabir Hussain (52), his brother Anwar Ali (45), their cousin Shoukat Ali Jafri (55), brother-in-law Mohammad Kabil (45) and their nephew Mukhtiyar Hussain (35). “Sabir is the kingpin of the gang and impersonated a senior CBI officer during the crimes. The other members posed as Sabir’s subordinates in the CBI,” said the DCP.Elaborating on the gang’s modus operandi, Singh said the suspects first identified the main jewellery markets in various states, collected information about suppliers and agents and then targeted them. They identified themselves as CBI officers and stole cash or gold on the pretext of checking the bags of the victims for unaccounted money, foreign currency, firearms or drugs, said police.On June 27, the Karol Bagh police received a call that four to five men, who claimed to be from the CBI, stole 300 grams of gold chains from the employee of a jewellery showroom . The employee told police that the suspects stopped him to check his bag and took away the gold chains. A case was registered and during investigation, police learnt that two similar cases of cheating, where the victims were duped of ₹12.5 lakh and ₹2 lakh, were reported from Karol Bagh in March and May.“The investigating team scanned CCTV cameras from Karol Bagh market to Hanuman Chambery on Pusa Road, covering nearly 1km stretch. Five men were seen following the jeweller’s employee. They were identified as members of the Irani gang from Bhopal,” said Singh.A police team visited Bhopal’s Irani Mohalla but the suspects were found missing. Investigators collected data of passengers travelling between Delhi and Bhopal via train and found that the suspects travelled to Delhi on June 26 and returned on June 30. It was further learnt that they would be travelling to Allahabad from Bhopal on August 1 in a train. “Our team searched the train at Jhansi railway station in Uttar Pradesh, caught all the five suspects and brought them to Delhi,” said the DCP.“They have been found to be involved in over 25 such crimes in Delhi, UP and West Bengal. They were declared proclaimed offenders in more than 10 cases,” added Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/5-arrested-for-taking-away-jewels-from-shop-by-posing-as-cbi-officials-101628447357470.html
09-08-2021||Delhi||Man dies after jumping off building during Outer Delhi flat eviction drive||A 25-year-old man died and another suffered fractures in his leg after they jumped off a building, from a height of nearly 25 feet, to avoid arrest in outer Delhi’s Vijay Vihar on Friday night, the police said.Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pranav Tayal said the two, along with four others, including a local property dealer identified as Manjeet, went to a house in Vijay Vihar, B-block, to evict a tenant from a fifth-floor flat allegedly at the behest of property owner, Atul Govil. The tenant, who is living in the flat for the past few years, was not vacating the property despite the owner’s repeated notices, the police said.“Govil tasked Manjeet to vacate the flat and find a new tenant. Manjeet roped in one Rajesh, who brought four men from Haryana’s Sonepat to do the job,” said the DCP.Around 8pm on Friday, Manjeet and Rajesh reached the building with the four hired men. Two of them stayed outside the building, and four went to the flat. But, it was locked.The four men allegedly broke the flat’s lock, removed the tenant’s belongings and put a new lock on the main door. Meanwhile, the tenant’s sister, who lives in the same locality, learnt about it and informed Vijay Vihar police station, the police said.Four policemen reached the building and caught the two suspects waiting outside. They then went inside the building and asked the four suspects to surrender.“The four men panicked and rushed to the adjacent buildings by scaling the railings on the building’s terrace,” said a police officer, who did not wish to be named.Two of them managed to escape, but two others got stuck on the terrace of the second building. To avoid getting caught, they jumped from the terrace of the building, said the officer.“The one who jumped off the building first, identified as Saurabh, died on the spot. Prime facie, it appears Saurabh sustained injuries because of the fall. His associate, Ankit, fractured his right leg. He was arrested,” said Tayal.Apart from Ankit, the other two arrested men were identified as Manjeet and Keshav. Their interrogation led to the arrest of the flat owner, Atul Govil. “We are now looking for Rajesh and the other suspect,” said the DCP.Police said they are verifying the antecedents of the arrested men.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-dies-after-jumping-off-building-during-outer-delhi-flat-eviction-drive-101628447355403.html
09-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s weekly markets, a window to the city’s culture, back in business||New Delhi: As it started raining on Sunday afternoon, Mohammad Ishmail quickly ran into his four-square-metre residence at the Jagdamba Camp slum cluster near Chirag Dilli to check if the roof was leaking once again. Inside, there was a mattress with no bedsheet, a plastic chair, a table made of plywood and an intriguing assortment of plastic soap cases, tiny mirrors, pocket-sized combs, cheap wallets and razors lay spread over a thin rug on the floor.“There is more inside the trunk,” said the 38-year-old pointing towards a metal trunk that looked heavy, as he quickly fixed a plastic sheet covering a tiny hole on the tin-ceiling of his residence in the slum.Ishmail is a travelling merchant, who keeps moving from one weekly market – popularly called Hafta Bazar – to another in the city in usual times for a living. At a hyperlocal level, most such Hafta Bazars are often named after the day of the week on which they operate – such as Mangal Bazar for weekly markets operating on Tuesdays, Budh Bazar for those operating on Wednesdays, and so on.Most such markets are closed for months in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic.Ishmail expects to be back in business from Monday, and the products that lay spread on the floor were fished out of the same trunk. He said, “Tomorrow, I shall be at the Mehrauli hafta bazar selling these goods. You can find me there. On Tuesdays, I am at Usmanpur. Wednesdays in Chirag Delhi. It is good that the government has finally taken a decision in our favour.”On Sunday, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) issued an order allowing all weekly markets in the city to operate from this Monday – essentially putting into implementation an announcement by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal the previous day, stressing on how these markets have to be preserved as large number of poor people depend on them for their livelihood.On August 2, the Delhi High Court asked the city government to consider reopening of weekly markets.As Delhi witnessed its worst Covid-19 wave, which left the city’s health infrastructure overwhelmed, the government implemented a lockdown on April 19. As Covid-19 cases started to decline, the government started with a phased relaxation process from May 31 and by mid-June they allowed one weekly market to operate per day per municipal zone.Delhi has 12 municipal zones, said a senior official in the government’s revenue department, which essentially means 84 weekly markets have more or less been functional in the city for the last two months.“But Delhi has more than 2,500 small and big weekly markets in total . From traders to suppliers and labourers, they engage lakhs of people. Around 250 such markets are quite prominent in the city including the ones in Shastri Park, Red Fort, Yamuna Pushta, Mandawali, Vasant Kunj and Karkardooma. So, the one market per day per municipal zone means many of them were suspended and the traders associated with those markets were in distress,” said Arbind Singh, national coordinator of the National Association of Street Vendors of India (NASVI), an advocacy group.The lockdown imposed because of the pandemic threw thousands into distress and Ishmail was among them. He recalled how he had to send his wife, who is a domestic worker, and nine-year-old son, to his extended family which resides at a village in Bihar’s East Champaran district.Not having the weekly markets functional near their residences was trouble for customers too.“Not having the weekly market functional in the neighbourhood was quite a problem. They offer a wide range of household essentials and we depend on that. But, yes, people should follow Covid-19 regulations without any compromise,” said Ganga Devi, a resident of New Ashok Nagar neighbourhood in east Delhi where three weekly markets in the vicinity have been non-functional for the last two months.Weekly markets in Delhi sell a wide range of products – rolling pins, kitchen knives, plastic toys, woollens, toiletries, garments, bangles, lipsticks, face creams, razors, stationeries, vegetables, fruits, spices, cooking oil, pickles, papad and what not. They largely cater to lower-income group households.“I see them more as a cultural thing,” said Rana Safvi, a Delhi-based historian and writer. “Where do you find bangle sellers in Delhi these days who used to walk around in localities selling their merchandise? In the weekly markets, you see such merchants. Traditionally a lot of them offered space to village residents in Delhi to display handmade products. While those rural areas turned into urban villages, such weekly markets remained. In most of them, the traders know their regular clients and they often form a bond.”It is quite likely that such bonds between merchants and clients have helped the former read the demographic demands better and innovate. For instance, several weekly markets in the city which function in areas inhabited by large numbers of people from Bengali and Odiya communities sell fish, several of them located in areas inhabited by North-East Indian communities sell packed dried fish and bamboo shoots.Film-maker and writer Sohail Hashmi highlighted historical roots of Delhi’s weekly markets. He said, “When contending armies fought for the control of Delhi, the residents of its villages had to suffer violence. It is said that Mohammad bin Tughlaq once erected a wall around his new capital city of Bijay Mandal, which is located near current-day localities Begum Pur, Sarvodya enclave and Sarvapriya Vihar. It would be a wall that would enclose within its folds his fort and all the surrounding villages and their lands. He named it Jahan Panah. A large part of the wall was demolished around 20 years ago to widen the Aurobindo Marg. Another part of the wall runs along the present-day Jahapanah Forest. The Sat Pula on the Saket-Sheikh Sarai Road near the Chirag Dilli drain too was a part of the wall but no trace of it remains there now. Tughlaq, however, died before the wall could be completed.``“The villages enclosed within the walls and those in its peripheries continued to exist for centuries producing all that they needed to survive or buying what they did not, from the weekly markets, held on fixed days of the week near each village. These markets were run by small travelling salesmen who set up shop at a new location each day of the week, coming back to each location once a week. Each travelling merchant catered to a fixed set of six or seven villages within a specific part of what were then the environs of Delhi. Much has changed in the wares that the hafta bazaar merchants sell today; the customers have also changed and yet much remains in these markets that needs to be preserved,” said Hashmi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-weekly-markets-a-window-to-the-city-s-culture-back-in-business-from-monday-101628447354871.html
09-08-2021||Delhi||DDMA allows students of classes 10, 11 and 12 to return to school||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Sunday allowed students of classes 10, 11 and 12 to visit schools for admission and board-exam related activities, in what is the first easing of restrictions on educational institutions, which have been broadly shut since March last year due to the pandemic, in the Capital since the fourth wave of infections.The state education department is expected to release an order on Monday detailing the guidelines and reopening protocol for schools and students, and these students can attend classes for these activities from Tuesday, if schools are prepared with the protocols, said officials.DDMA issued the rules as part of a general order on Covid-19 curbs on Sunday that also allowed spas and weekly markets to reopen in Delhi, subject to their adherence to public health restrictions.“Students of class 10 to 12 are permitted to visit their schools for admission related work including counselling/guidance and practical activities related to board exams,” said the DDMA order on Sunday, adding that the directorate of education will “issue appropriate guidelines” on the same to “ensure that Covid-appropriate protocols are followed and children’s safety is ensured.”The order, however, specifies that all educational institutes in the Capital including schools, colleges, and coaching centres will remain closed and online learning will be encouraged in all circumstances except the exempted activities.“Health checkup and referral services situated in schools or conducted from there [schools] can resume. Children of all ages may visit such centres accompanied by their parent or guardian,” the order also said. Several government schools have health centres for children.Schools and colleges in the national capital have been shut since March last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Offline classes for students in classes 9 to 12 briefly resumed in a staggered manner between January and February before being suspended again due to the fourth wave of the pandemic in the Capital. Sunday’s order, however, allows only class 10 and 12 students to come for practical activities and class 11 students to come for admission-related work.A senior education department official said, “Along with preparation for board exams next year, the Class 10 results have also been released, and students need to choose their subject combination to complete Class 11 admission formalities as well. The DDMA order allows students of classes 10 to 12 to return to schools immediately. So we will issue the guidelines tomorrow [Monday]. Schools can follow the guidelines, make necessary arrangements and call students from Tuesday if they wish to do so.”A senior state government official on Friday told HT that deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia reportedly told a DDMA meeting that a significant majority of parents who attended a mega parent-teacher meeting (PTM) of government schools were in favour of reopening schools.Around 90% of 800,000 parents who attended the two-week parent-teacher meeting were in favour of resuming classes, said the government official.On July 28, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia also asked parents, students, teachers, and all stakeholders to email their suggestions on reopening of schools and colleges. HT reported on Saturday that of the 33,000 people who wrote to the campaign, 68% respondents wanted schools to reopen and 83% voted for colleges to reopen.On Friday, DDMA decided to set up a committee, including officials from the education and health departments, to work out a strategy to reopen educational institutions.Several states, including Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Odisha, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, have either partially reopened schools or are in the process of doing so this month.With the Capital’s Covid-19 caseload at a nearly 16-month low, schools and parents have asked the government if schools will reopen for senior students soon. This is mainly because of the two-term board examination introduced by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) this year to prepare for an “unprecedented situation” arising due to the pandemic next year. The first set of board examinations for Class 10 and 12 students is set to take place between November and December this year.While most government school principals are keen on initiating in-person classes for students, several private school principals said convincing parents to send their children to school amid the impending third wave will be a challenge.Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said teachers want students to come to school in a staggered manner due to academic loss and Covid fatigue, which is affecting their mental health.“Some students are worried about their health, but others are confident of the Covid-19 protocols implemented by the schools earlier this year and wouldn’t mind coming back to school. Parents too have been non-committal because children haven’t vaccinated, and there are apprehensions of a third wave. Once the order comes in, we will formulate a policy and that might inspire some confidence among them,” she said.Principals of government school also welcomed the move. “Calling students in smaller groups will be a good option since the caseload is low. We have around 900 students in class 12 and around 1,000 students in class 10 so care has to be taken to call these students in smaller batches. Children are often not able to grasp everything taught in online classes or even attend those classes regularly so it is a good move to allow them to visit schools and interact with their teachers,” said Sujata Tamta, head of school at Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, Molarband.Not all parents, however, are confident of the move because children are not eligible for Covid-19 vaccine jabs, which in India are limited to adults.“The decision is taken on the basis of responses collected from government schools where there has been no proper teaching-learning in the past one year. It is understandable that parents want their children to go to schools. But parents in most private schools are not keen on sending their children for in-person classes,” said Aprajita Gautam, president of the Delhi Parents Association.“Private schools welcome the decision taken by DDMA. We are hopeful that the complete reopening [of schools] is being discussed and will be a reality soon. We all will together ensure safety of our students. We look forward to full and positive support by our parents,” said Bharat Arora, general secretary, Action Committee of Unaided Private Schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ddma-allows-students-of-classes-10-11-and-12-to-return-to-school-for-admission-board-exam-related-work-101628447351503.html
09-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi: 2 in raincoats, who robbed gold finance companies with toy guns, arrested||Two people who robbed gold finance companies, wearing raincoats and with toy pistols, have been arrested, the police said on Sunday.The police said they were involved in two robbery cases reported from Greater Kailash and Kalkaji between January and July. Two raincoats, two toy pistols, a scooter that the suspects, Dheeraj Chaudhary and Pankaj Chaudhary, used during the crimes were seized along with ₹4,000 in cash.“Both of them are originally from Bihar’s Madhubani district. Dheeraj lives in Panipat. They used to travel to Delhi from Bihar and Panipat, meet at Badarpur, committed robberies and returned to their respective places. In both the robberies, they used toy pistol, wore raincoats, masks and gloves to hide their faces and avoid leaving any finger prints at the crime scene,” said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur.On July 30, an employee of a gold finance company reported that two people wearing raincoats entered the company’s office in Greater Kailash Enclave-II, held the office boy on gunpoint and took away around ₹75,000. A case of robbery was registered and CCTV cameras were checked. The police learnt that the suspects had a white scooter. and were also seen roaming around areas in Kalkaji Market, Lajpat Nagar market, Nizamuddin and GK-1 market in separate CCTV footage from these areas. The same suspects committed a similar robbery in Kalkaji in January.“Our teams scanned the footage from cameras installed on the routes that the suspects took. They found that the suspects met each other and started from Badarpur Chowk. Their identities were established through technical investigation and human intelligence network. They were caught from Panipat and Noida between Friday and Saturday,” said a senior police officer.The two told the police that they were inspired by the TV crime shows, the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-two-in-raincoats-who-robbed-gold-finance-companies-with-toy-guns-arrested-101628447290896.html
09-08-2021||Delhi||Govt to track EWS students in Delhi’s private schools online||In order to track the retention and dropouts of marginalised students in Delhi’s private schools, the state education department has put in place an online system to track the attendance of students admitted under the Economically Weaker Section (EWS), Disadvantaged Groups (DG), and Children With Special Needs (CWSN) reserved categories.According to the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 25% of seats in entry-level classes — nursery, kindergarten and Class 1 — in all private schools are to be reserved for the EWS/DG categories, a provision that includes 3% reservation under CWSN category as well. Students admitted under these categories are entitled to free textbooks, writing material, and uniforms till Class 8, for which the government reimburses a fixed amount to the schools.Officials told HT that the online attendance system will initially record data for students admitted in the 2021-22 academic session and gradually be expanded for other classes. The department is also planning to integrate the platform with a similar reimbursement system planned to streamline the process.In a notice issued to all private schools on August 3, deputy direction of education (private school branch) Yogesh Pal Singh said, “All concerned private unaided recognised schools are hereby directed to update the attendance of admitted students under EWS/DG and CWSN category regularly on the link. Non-compliance of the direction shall be viewed seriously.”Schools can access the attendance module on the education department’s official website.According to state department data, around 32,500 out of the 126,000 applicants this year have been allotted seats in Delhi’s private schools. Of these, approximately 19,500 students have completed the admission procedure so far. The last date for applicants to report for admission to private schools has been extended to August 16.A senior official of the education department said, “In order to have inclusive education as envisaged in the RTE Act, the education department needs to monitor how many of these EWS students continue in school. Until now, it was difficult to track the number of EWS dropouts from private schools. Collecting data on attendance will help us form targeted interventions to reduce dropouts and check for the retention of these students. We also plan to integrate this with the reimbursement system to ensure streamlining of the process.”The DoE centrally conducts admissions to seats under the EWS/DG categories through a computerised draw of lots. The department prepares a list of EWS students allotted to private schools.Several parents said schools have denied admission to their ward this year, despite being allotted a seat. This is due to the prevalent practice under which schools admit one EWS student from the government’s allotted list for every three general category students admitted by them. This year, however, there have been little to no admissions under the general category for several private schools due to the Covid-19 pandemic — leading schools to turn away EWS parents.Though deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia asked all private schools in the Capital to admit allotted EWS students, a circular released by the education department later allowed schools to file for an exemption if they wished. Several activists working in the sector said some schools used this as a loophole.“An attendance system will work when physical classes start. Right now, everything is online and most of these students don’t have the means to attend the classes. The government should first ensure admissions in these schools. The exemption order has emboldened schools to find an excuse to deny admission to EWS students. Parents have been approaching us with repeated complaints of either not getting admission or being denied the free books,” said Ekramul Haque, who runs NGO Mission Taleem working on underprivileged children.SK Bhattacharya, president of Action Committee of Unaided Recognised Private Schools (ACURPS), said, “We can send attendance on a monthly basis, but it will be a challenge to do it on an everyday level. Besides, why focus on only EWS students in private schools and not marginalised students in all schools? We have to wait to understand the intention behind this new development.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-to-track-ews-students-in-delhi-s-private-schools-online-101628447232138.html
09-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal launches free food scheme for homeless||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday launched a food distribution programme for the homeless living in government shelter homes across the city.The drive was launched at a shelter in Sarai Kale Khan, where Kejriwal said that the Delhi government runs 209 night shelters across the city and free cooked meals will be provided to nearly 6,000 people here. This number will go up to 12,000 as more people live in shelter homes during winters.Under the programme, the Delhi government along with Akshaya Patra Foundation will distribute free cooked meals to the homeless at all of its shelter homes across the city.“The poorest of the poor live in these shelters homes. They are not the vote bank of any party so no government paid attention to them. This is the first work of any responsible government to pay attention towards the poor. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government is a responsible government and we have worked a lot for the poor. I am happy to start this initiative,” Kejriwal said.He added that earlier high court used to scold the governments for dismal condition of shelter homes, but the AAP government worked a lot on this front to improve the situation of these homes. “In the last six years, we have improved the condition of shelter homes. I personally conducted inspections to improve the situation of toilets and potable water in shelter homes. And today, the condition is good,” he said.“The real dharma is feeding the poor which Akshay Patra is doing. We are happy that free cooked meals will be distributed permanently at all Delhi shelter homes in association with Akshay Patra Foundation,” Kejriwal said.The Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) runs 209 shelter home across the city that caters to nearly 12,000 people. The government has been providing free food to the homeless since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.The event was presided by Madhu Pandit Dasa, Chairman, The Akshaya Patra Foundation, and Chanchalapathi Dasa, Vice-Chairman of the organisation. Delhi Urban Development Minister Satyendar Jain was also present on the occasion.Dasa said, “Akshaya Patra is conscious of its responsibility towards society. We have always strived to assist the government’s efforts to bring relief to people during emergencies. We will continue with this as long as we can.” The event was followed by a ceremonial serving of meals to poor children at the shelter home complex.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-chief-minister-arvind-kejriwal-launches-free-food-scheme-for-homeless-in-the-capital-101628447050875.html
09-08-2021||Delhi||DDA to notify changes in land pooling policy soon||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) will soon notify changes in the land pooling policy, which was notified in 2018, such as provisions for plotted development, transferable development rights etc. in areas where land pooling will be implemented.The proposed modifications were put up for public scrutiny in May and last week, and DDA held a public hearing on it. “We will soon finalise the recommendations based on the public hearing and table it in the authority meeting next month. Once approved, it will be sent to the Union housing and urban affairs ministry for final notification,” said a senior DDA official aware of the development.The land pooling policy is aimed at meeting the growing housing demand by providing close to 17 lakh dwelling units in 95 urbanised villages located in urban extension of the city.The land-owning agency, which has got hundreds of land owners agreeing to pool over 6,500 hectares of land under the policy so far, plans to develop 15 priority sectors in three planning zones N, P-II and L (near Rohini, Alipur and Bakkarwala respectively).To make these sectors operational, DDA officials said, some changes have been made in the policy.Till now, only group housing complexes were allowed in land pooling areas for residential development. A senior DDA official said, “We have now allowed plotted development as well. For plotted development, the minimum area has to be 5,000 sq.m and the size of plots will range between 100- 300 sq.m.”The draft Master Plan of Delhi-2041 has provision for heritage transferable development rights (Heritage TDR) which allows owners of heritage property owners to sell unutilised Floor Area Ratio of their property (which is calculated by deducting the existing FAR of the property from the FAR allowed in the area for the type of land use).A senior DDA official said, “All plots, except plotted housing, will be allowed to utilise TDR up to a maximum of 10% of the permissible FAR of the plot in land pooling area. But TDR can be used only in TDR receiving areas which DDA will identify.”The land owning agency will come up with regulations for the use of TDR. The DDA plans to set up a portal to facilitate the sale and purchase of TDR, said an official.DDA has modified the development control norms for land pooling areas making it mandatory for developer entities to provide walking and cycling networks. It has made it mandatory for all commercial, industrial, public and semi-public plots and vertical-mix plots located on 24m or more wide roads to have active frontages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dda-to-notify-changes-in-land-pooling-policy-soon-101628446993124.html
09-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s Covid-19 curbs, relaxations, now brought under colour-coded action plan||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Sunday directed all district administrations to strictly adhere to the graded response action plan (GRAP) to help the government take decisions on restrictions and relaxations in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic.The government will now issue daily alerts twice in the day, first in the morning and evening, informing about the level of alert according to the colour-coded system under the GRAP so that corresponding prescribed actions can be taken up .“The permitted, prohibited and restricted activities shall be as per level of alerts specified in the graded response action plan with immediate effect and till further orders… GNCTD shall be responsible to broadcast daily morning and evening press bulletin regarding the level of alert… Secretary (I&P), district magistrates and deputy commissioners, as well as all authorities concerned shall ensure that the alert should be immediately disseminated extensively,” the DDMA said in an order issued on Sunday, a copy of which HT has seen.The graded response action plan, which harks back to a similar mechanism to fight air pollution during pre-winter months, was drafted by an expert committee formed by the Delhi government and approved by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on July 8. It classifies outbreak severity into four bands – yellow, amber, orange and red – with each representing a more severe outbreak and, thus, stricter curbs than the one preceding it.According to the plan, private offices, malls, weekly markets and the Metro will be shut down in Delhi if the test positivity rate (TPR) rises above 2%, and the city will be put under a curfew if the number breaches 5%, according to a new Covid-19 action plan approved by authorities that sets clear thresholds for curbs that kick in from as low as 0.5% TPR in order to scuttle an outbreak.The colour-coded classifications take into account three factors: the test positivity rate over two consecutive days, new cases over a seven-day period, and the average weekly hospital occupancy rate.According to the plan, seen by HT, the first category of the curbs are triggered when the positivity rate crosses 0.5%, or new cases over a week exceeds 1,500, or if there are more than 500 oxygen beds occupied on average over a seven-day period.Once any of these thresholds are breached, the city will be put under the yellow alert mechanism in which non-essential shops are allowed to open only on an odd-even basis, a night curfew comes into force, and offices are required to move half of their staff to a work-from-home function.Currently, the Covid-19 situation in Delhi, based on any of parameters, does not necessitate any alert even though schools, colleges and education institutes remain closed; political, cultural, religious, academic and all form of large gatherings remain prohibited; public transport is limited to seating capacities of vehicles; and there are restrictions applicable on economic activities such as 50% capacity for restaurants and bars, no visitors in religious places, maximum caps on marriage and funeral events, etc.If test positivity, case numbers and hospitalisations rise further, the amber alert comes into effect. In this scenario, some venues and activities are completely halted: parks need to close, barber shops cannot open, and dining in at restaurants will be prohibited (as will the opening of bars). Amber alert is when TPR rises above 1%, or if there are more than 3,500 cases over a week, or if oxygen bed occupancy surpasses 700.The next alert level, orange, takes effect if TPR breaches 2%, the number of new cases in a week goes beyond 9,000, or if the average number of oxygen beds occupied over the week goes beyond 3,000. In this scenario, private offices, malls, Metro rail services and weekly markets will be shut down.In the most severe red alert category (if TPR is above 5%, cumulative weekly case above 16,000 or hospital occupancy above 3,000), there will be a 24-hour curfew with people allowed outside only for essential services. In this scenario, all offices engaged in non-essential work need to shift to a completely work-from-home functioning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhis-covid-19-curbs-relaxations-now-brought-under-colour-coded-action-plan-101628446931946.html
09-08-2021||Chandigarh||Three years on, martyr Sukhdev’s ancestral house still lies forgotten in Ludhiana||With less than a week left for the Independence Day, while the administration is gearing up for celebrations, the ancestral house of freedom fighter Sukhdev Thapar continues to remain forgotten in the narrow lanes of Naughara Mohalla near Chaura Bazaar.Having stood the test of time so far, the building’s walls are gradually losing strength, water is seeping into the structure due to leaking water pipes and heaps of garbage lie strewn around the structure, reflecting the administration’s apathy towards its legacy.This, despite chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh announcing a ₹1-crore grant in 2018 for the beautification of the 70 square yards building and a direct passage from Chaura Bazaar.For three years, the martyr’s kin and members of the Shaheed Sukhdev Thapar Memorial Trust have been making rounds of government offices to get the work kick-started, but in vain.“Even in 2013, the central government had announced a grant of ₹81 lakh for the building’s maintenance and a direct approach road after we moved the Punjab and Haryana high court. But only ₹12 lakh were spent,” said Ashok Thapar, president, Shaheed Sukhdev Thapar Memorial Trust.“The house is immensely special because this is where Sukhdev Thapar was born on May 15, 1907. As it’s over 150 years old, it requires extensive repairs. Even the monument clerk deputed by the archaeology department of the state government rarely visits the building. It is the last memory of the martyr and his heritage. At least the garbage should be cleared from the house,” he added. According to the trust members, besides repairs, a direct approach road to the house was also important so that more people could visit the historical landmark. Currently, people have to negotiate narrow lanes to reach the site, while many don’t even know it exists.Trust’s secretary Tribhuvan Thapar said the government on July 14 had issued a notification for conducting social impact assessment before acquiring land for creating the direct approach road. It had directed the authorities to complete this in 15 days, but the process had yet to be started, he added. Sukhdev Thapar, commonly known as Sukhdev, was executed along with Bhagat Singh and Rajguru by the British colonial government on March 23, 1931.Despite several attempts, deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Kumar Sharma was not available for comments.Meanwhile, MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “We are already working on the social impact assessment. I will direct the officials to expedite the process. The sanitation staff will clean the area around the house soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/three-years-on-martyr-sukhdev-s-ancestral-house-lies-forgotten-in-ludhiana-101628446273016.html
09-08-2021||Pune||PMC starts debris collection centres in 10 ward offices||PUNE: With only ten spaces available to set up collection centres for construction and demolition (C&D) waste in the city area, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is on the lookout for five more spaces in the remaining ward offices to set up other such centres.Ajit Deshmukh, deputy municipal commissioner of the solid waste department, PMC, said, “We now want open land measuring 10,000 to 15,000 square feet as collection centre for the debris. However, we have got open land in 10 ward office jurisdictions where we have started the service of collecting and transporting C&D waste to the Wagholi plant for processing. We are searching for five more spaces in the remaining ward office jurisdictions.”Meanwhile, the solid waste department has announced a toll-free helpline (18002339595) for lifting and transporting C&D waste to open land reserved by the corporation to avoid illegal dumping along riversides and in riverbeds, nullahs and open grounds. With the city generating over 200 tonne of C&D waste every day, the decision has been taken in keeping with the larger objective of the “Swachh Sarvekshan 2020”. The PMC has finalised a rate of Rs19 per kilometre per tonne for lifting and ferrying the C&D waste. The civic body will in turn pay the contractor Rs195 per tonne of C&D waste for recycling at the Wagholi plant. However, the corporation has decided to offer the service free-of-cost to citizens while charging from builders and developers.“The contractor has started the Wagholi plant operations. The plant has the capacity to process 200 tonne of waste per day and the company will produce bricks and construction-related material as byproduct,” Deshmukh said.The PMC has been trying to find a solution to the problem of C&D waste for a while now and in 2016, it announced a project for recycling the same and acquired government land for the purpose at Wagholi. Already, the civic body has imposed a ban on dumping debris in open spaces, riverbeds, nullahs and quarries with any such activities attracting a fine of Rs25,000. However, people have been dumping debris at night to avoid the penalty.

09-08-2021||Pune||Pune sees rollback of Covid curbs, with rider||PUNE Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad will once again be return to normalcy for a third time in 12 months, after deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, on Sunday, extended timings for shops, restaurants and public gardens. The new guidelines will be effective Monday, with the most distinct element being weekend curbs rolled back after almost six months. According to the announcement by Pawar, all shops in the two cities will now be open till 8pm, from the existing deadline of 4pm. Hotels and restaurants are allowed to operate dine-in facilities at 50% capacity till 10 pm. Pawar also offered major relief to malls, which have been allowed to reopen till 8pm for fully vaccinated customers and staff members. Gardens, which were open in the mornings, have also been allowed to operate between 4pm and 7pm. Sports activities in PMC and PCMC have also been allowed to resume throughout the day, except for swimming and sports which require close contact. On Sunday evening, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporations issued identical orders formalising the relaxations. According to these orders, both corporations will have a night curfew between 11pm and 5am, while assembly of more than five persons has been prohibited after 11pm. Beauty parlours, saloons, spas, wellness centres and gyms have also been allowed to operate till 8pm at 50% capacity and with prior appointments. While allowing shop owners to operate on weekends, the administration has asked them to follow their previous weekly days of closure. This means areas like Laxmi road and Tulsibaug will remain closed every Monday. Curbs in the rural parts have also been eased partially. Rural areas in Pune district, that covers 13 tehsils, have been moved from level 4 restrictions to level 3, as previously announced by the state government. The announcement of relaxations came with a warning from Pawar. The deputy chief minister warned that the relaxations would be withdrawn if the positivity rate exceeds 7%. “The decision on relaxations in PMC and PCMC has been taken because the positivity rate has been dropped. All people have to use masks and follow Covid appropriate behaviour,” said the guardian minister. The decision for offering relaxations came after a week of confusion, political blame-game and defiance by traders in Pune, who violated the 4pm deadline and kept shutters open till 7pm for the past four days. Commenting on agitation by traders, Pawar said, “Nobody should try to break the rules. Administration has some responsibilities. No government likes to put curbs as it impacts tax collection and we also have to generate salaries and pensions of staff. But, health of citizens is most important.” On their part, traders and hoteliers welcomed the decision saying they will abide by the rules. The existing curbs were re-imposed in July after parts of state reported the Delta-plus Covid variant, forcing the government go into extra-cautious mode and roll back relaxations offered in June, when thee second wave had waned. According to the administration, the positivity rate in PMC areas stands at 3.3%, while in PCMC it is at 3.5% and in the rural areas it is at 5.5%. While public representatives from rural parts too demanded relief on the lines of city areas, Pawar said these may get some relief next week, if the positivity rate drops below 5%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-pcmc-unlocked-again-malls-reopened-shop-timings-extended-to-8pm-restaurants-till-10pm-101628438770318.html
09-08-2021||Pune||Feast on last day of Ashadh in Pune; sale of 400 tonnes of chicken, 1,200 goats||Pune: On the last day of Hindu calendar’s Ashadh month, over 400 tonnes of chicken, 1,200 goats and fish were sold in the city on Sunday. From Monday, the holy month of Shravan begins when many Hindus do not eat non-vegetarian food and consume liquor. Since early morning, long queues were seen outside chicken, mutton and fish shops across the city. Many preferred to buy cooked food from restaurants and home-cooked deliveries. The last day of Ashadh is also popularly known as the “Akhad special party” celebrated with drinks and non-veg food. “The import volume of chicken has been high since last two months and rates were also stable till last week. Later, it dropped by around ₹40 per kg, but today since morning the rate per kg remained stable at ₹210 and over 400 tonnes of chicken were sold in Pune city on Sunday. The sale figure in rest of the district was 250-300 tonnes,” said Rupesh Pardeshi, president of Pune district broiler association. There was a huge demand for the goat mutton. “Mutton shop owners were prepared for it and brought extra goats for today. More than 1,200 goats were brought to the city on Saturday at various mutton shops and the rate was between ₹700 and ₹740 per kg. Compared to last year, this time there was good sale of mutton, as Covid restrictions were relaxed and people now prefer mutton,” said Prabhakar Kamble, president, Mutton Shopkeepers Association, Pune. Thakur Pardeshi, one of the fish shop owners in the city, said, “Supply was less compared to demand in the city today. Kingfish, pamphlet, mackerel and prawn were in high demand. With less supply, the rates were hiked by around 20 per cent.” Many sought home-cooked non-vegetarian food. Sagar Abnawe said, “We ordered food from one of our friends who cooks at home and does home delivery. We ordered chicken and variety of fish dishes and enjoyed with the family.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/feast-on-last-day-of-ashadh-in-pune-sale-of-400-tonnes-of-chicken-1-200-goats-101628437690376.html

In an opinion piece in The Australian newspaper, Abbott said the “answer to almost every question about China is India.” “With the world’s other emerging superpower becoming more belligerent almost by the day, it’s in everyone’s interests that India take its rightful place among the nations as quickly as possible,” Abbott, who visited India last week, wrote.“Because trade deals are about politics as much as economics, a swift deal between India and Australia would be an important sign of the democratic world’s tilt away from China, as well as boosting the long-term prosperity of both our countries,” he added.Also read | Australian trade envoy Tony Abbott meets PM Modi, bilateral trade ties on agendaAs Australia's prime minister, Abbott oversaw a bilateral free trade deal with China, which took effect in 2015 and also hosted a state visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping a year before that. However, after Australia banned Chinese telecom giant Huawei from major communications infrastructure projects and called for an independent probe into the origins of the coronavirus, ties between Beijing and Canberra have soured.Abbott, also a former prime minister, stressed that Australia needed drastically to move away from Beijing and argued that India was a “natural partner” to his country. “India and Australia are like-minded democracies whose relationship had been underdeveloped, at least until Narendra Modi became India’s prime minister,” he said.Also read | China suspends ‘economic dialogue mechanism’ with Australia"India and Australia are like-minded democracies whose relationship had been under-developed, at least until Narendra Modi became India's Prime Minister. Under Modi, India has revived the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, and the first in-person Quad summit is expected before the end of the year," he said."Under Modi, India has invited Australia to join the annual Malabar naval exercises that will soon involve India, the United States, Japan, Australia and also the United Kingdom's visiting carrier strike group led by the Royal Navy's new flagship HMS Queen Elizabeth. It will be an impressive show of strength, demonstrating the democracies' commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific," he added.India, Abbott pointed out, is Australia's seventh-biggest trade partner with an annual trade turnover of about $30 billion and said that despite being hampered by tariffs and mutual perceptions that neither country is always a good place to do business. He also said the problem is that China's “daunting power is a consequence of the free world's decision to invite a communist dictatorship into global trading networks.”Also read | Australia cancels belt and road deals; China warns of further damage to ties“China has exploited the West’s goodwill and wishful thinking to steal our technology and undercut our industries; and, in the process, become a much more powerful competitor than the old Soviet Union ever was, because it’s now a first-rate economy that’s rapidly developing a military to match; and spoiling for a fight over Taiwan, a pluralist democracy of 25 million that’s living proof there’s no totalitarian gene in the Chinese DNA,” Abbott added.Abbott met PM Modi last Thursday and discussed ways to further strengthen bilateral trade, investment and economic cooperation to realise the full potential of the India-Australia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, according to a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). They emphasised that enhanced economic cooperation between India and Australia would help the two countries in realising their shared vision of a stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/-answer-to-almost-every-question-about-china-is-india-australia-s-tony-abbott-101628528582343.html

India, as the UNSC president this month, noted the threats to maritime safety and security and called upon the members to consider implementing the 2000 UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.External affairs minister S Jaishankar later thanked all members for “supporting the first signature event of Indian Presidency” after the statement on maritime security was unanimously adopted by UNSC. “Ten non Council members sent their written position underlining that the debate was timely and relevant. PM articulated five key maritime principles- on trade, disputes, natural disasters, environment and connectivity,” Jaishankar tweeted.Also read | PM Modi lays roadmap for maritime security cooperation at UNSCPrime Minister Modi called for a “framework of mutual understanding and cooperation” on maritime security as he outlined five principles, including the settling of maritime disputes peacefully and in accordance with international laws. Among the four other principles proposed by PM Modi as chair of a high-level debate were freed maritime trade, jointly fighting maritime threats from natural disasters and non-state actors, preservation of the maritime environment and promoting “responsible maritime connectivity”.#IndiainUNSC✅Adopted👉🏻Presidential Statement on Maritime Security adopted by the #UNSC🔹An important recognition of the importance of maritime security by the UNSC🔹A call for international cooperation. pic.twitter.com/AeZDyF8vVyModi is the first Indian prime minister to preside over a UNSC open debate focussed on ways to effectively counter maritime crime and strengthen coordination in the domain. The meeting was attended by several heads of state and government of member states of the UNSC, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and US secretary of state Antony Blinken. The UNSC for the first time discussed maritime security as an exclusive agenda item in such a high-level open debate.Also read | At UNSC, India’s values and interests convergeAfter Modi’s address, Putin suggested the creation of a maritime security body in the UNSC to address maritime crimes, piracy and maritime terrorism and vowed his country will ensure security in the Persian Gulf and the Atlantic Ocean amid a surge across the globe in piracy-related incidents. "Unfortunately, there are also many threats along sea routes. And that is why it is so important that today we are considering substantive, practical issues related to the fight against piracy of the 21st century, meaning to establish a more effective counteraction to transnational crime and prevent the use of seas and oceans for criminal purposes", Sputnik quoted the Russian president as saying.Speaking at the debate, Blinken thanked India for its leadership and bringing all the countries together for a discussion on maritime security and for “India's leadership on these issues,” especially in the Indo-Pacific. "That's why I'm grateful for India's leadership in bringing us together today and calling on all nations to recommit to defending and strengthening the maritime rules and principles that we forge together and committed to uphold,” Blinken said, according to PTI.Monday’s virtual high-level open debate on maritime security is one of the three signature events of India’s current presidency of the powerful 15-nation UN body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unsc-adopts-first-ever-statement-on-maritime-security-under-india-s-presidency-101628525911290.html
09-08-2021||World||Modi calls for UN ‘framework’ on maritime security||Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday called for a “framework of mutual understanding and cooperation” on maritime security based on five principles that include the settling of maritime disputes “peacefully and in accordance with international laws”, which is something that China has disregarded in furthering its claims in the South China Sea.Freed maritime trade, jointly fighting maritime threats from natural disasters and non-state actors such as pirates, preservation of maritime environment and promoting “responsible maritime connectivity” were the other four “basic principles” proposed by the prime minister as chair of a high-level debate on ‘Enhancing Maritime Security - A Case for International Cooperation’.The UN Security Council adopted India’s presidential statement on maritime security.Modi became on Monday the first Indian prime minister to chair, although virtually, a high-level debate of the UN Security Council, using its month-long rotational presidency for August. The debate was attended by several heads of state and government such as Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Vietnam’s Pham Minh Chinh, and Democratic Republic of Congo’s Felix Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo, who is also president of the African Union, and US secretary of state Antony Blinken.India hosted the maritime security debate as a signature event, with two more later in the month that will be focused on UN peacekeeping and counter-terrorism.OCEANS: LIFELINE OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE“Oceans are our shared global commons, they are also the lifeline of international trade. Above all, they are key to our planet’s future,” the prime minister said in Hindi as translated into English by an official interpreter. “However, today this common heritage of ours faces various types of threats. Maritime routes are being misused for piracy and terrorism. There are maritime disputes between countries. And climate change and natural disasters are also challenges to our maritime domain.”In this context, Modi added, “We need a framework for mutual understanding and cooperation in order to conserve and utilise our shared maritime heritage. Such a framework cannot be created by any country alone. It requires a joint effort by all of us.”Laying out the five “basic principles”, Prime Minister Modi recalled in details India’s own role in observing and promoting them, going back to the Harappan civilisation whose Lothal port had extensive maritime trade linkages to other contemporary civilisations and he underscored the freedom of these routes that allowed Buddha’s preachings to spread around the world. “Free maritime trade has always been part of the civilisational ethos of India,” he said.SETTLING MARITIME DISPUTES PEACEFULLYOn the principle of settling maritime disputes peacefully and in accordance with international law, the prime minister spoke, once again, India’s own efforts in this regard and cited the resolution of its own differences with Bangladesh. “This is extremely important for promoting mutual trust and confidence and ensuring global peace and stability.”The prime minister did not mention China, which has shown itself to be most prolific violator of maritime laws in settling disputes and furthering claims, such as in the South China Sea.Blinken, the US secretary of state, did not hold his punches though. He spoke forcefully on ongoing disputes and claims and counterclaims in the South China Sea, without naming China, which is at the heart of them all. “When a state faces no consequences for ignoring these rules, he said, referring to South China Sea actions without naming China, “it fuels greater impunity and instability everywhere”.China’s deputy permanent representative Dai Bing pushed back later, says the Security Council was not the right forum for discussing South China Sea and attacked the United States as “unqualified to make irresponsible remarks on the”. “The United States has been stirring up trouble out of nothing.”The need for action on maritime security was echoed, however, by all participants in the debate. President Putin, who spoke after Modi, proposed “establishing a special structure within the UN system that would directly deal with the issue of fighting maritime crime in various regions”. He added that the structure “should be based on the support of the UN member states, and actively engage experts, representatives of civil society, academia, and private sector”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/modi-calls-for-un-framework-on-maritime-security-101628522476276.html

UK high court Judge Martin Chamberlain ruled that an appeal looking at the consequences to Nirav Modi’s state of mind is “reasonably arguable”. In June, the UK high court turned down Nirav Modi’s appeal against his extradition to India.The Westminster Magistrates’ Court cleared Nirav Modi’s extradition in February this year and found him guilty of fraud and money laundering in the PNB fraud. The court also dismissed his claims that he wouldn’t get a fair trial in India. UK home secretary Priti Patel approved the extradition in April.Nirav Modi then approached the UK high court to ascertain if there were any grounds for an appeal against Patel’s decision or the Westminster Magistrates’ Court order. Modi’s appeal was rejected by a high court judge.According to ANI, Nirav Modi's lawyer in an application to the UK high court last month to appeal against his extradition said it would seriously impact his mental health and would worsen "suicidal feelings". Edward Fitzgerald said Modi was "severely depressed" and asked that the extradition be blocked on mental health grounds, the news agency added.Also read | 'Will continue to make all efforts to bring back fugitives': MEAFitzgerald said in the application that Modi's mental health and suicidal feelings would worsen if he were to land in Mumbai’s "Covid-rich" Arthur Road Jail.

09-08-2021||World||Pakistan again claims no evidence Afghan envoy’s daughter was abducted||Pakistan has reiterated its contention that there is no evidence the Afghan envoy’s daughter was abducted and assaulted in Islamabad, an incident that took ties between the two countries to a new low. Selsela Alikhil, the 26-year-old daughter of Afghan ambassador Najibullah Alikhil, was abducted, held for almost five hours and assaulted by unidentified men in Islamabad on July 16. Two days later, the Afghan government recalled its envoy and senior diplomats from Islamabad and closed its embassy over security concerns. When a delegation from Afghanistan visited Islamabad to conduct its own inquiries into the incident and to assess the safety of Afghan officials, the Pakistani side informed the team that “findings on the ground did not corroborate the report by” the envoy’s daughter. The development comes at a time when Kabul has accused Islamabad of failing to prevent some 10,000 foreign fighters from groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) sneaking into Afghanistan to fight alongside the Taliban. Afghan leaders have also said Pakistan hasn’t done enough to push the Taliban to join negotiations to find a political settlement. Also Read | Cong leader demands immediate evacuation of Sikhs, Hindus from AfghanistanThe Afghan delegation met officials from Pakistan’s law enforcement agencies and foreign ministry. The delegation was given a briefing on all aspects of the investigation conducted by Pakistani authorities and shown video footage from “various locations of different timings in which [the envoy’s daughter] was clearly identifiable moving around the places independently”, Pakistan’s Foreign Office said in a statement. The Afghan delegation was also taken to all the sites visited by the envoy’s daughter and given a presentation of technical data such as mobile data. “The delegation was conveyed that law enforcement agencies had carried out detailed and thorough investigation in the complaint and a comprehensive witness account led to the conclusion that the findings on the ground did not corroborate the report by the complainant. This was further substantiated by the technical evidence,” the statement said. Pakistani authorities reiterated an earlier request for additional information and access to evidence and Selsela Alikhil. The Afghan delegation was informed about measures taken to enhance the security of the Afghan embassy in Islamabad and consulates in other cities. “At this critical juncture in the Afghan peace process, it is extremely important to work jointly for the shared objective of a peaceful, stable and prosperous Afghanistan. Pakistan hopes that the embassy of Afghanistan in Islamabad would soon resume its normal operations,” the statement said. Afghanistan had also expressed deep concern over Pakistan interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed’s claims that there was no evidence the envoy’s daughter was abducted. Ahmed had also claimed the abduction was part of a conspiracy by India’s intelligence agencies. The Afghan side had said such remarks could lead to greater mistrust between the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-again-claims-no-evidence-afghan-envoy-s-daughter-was-abducted-101628507235263.html
09-08-2021||World||International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples 2021: Theme, significance||The International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples is celebrated every year on August 9. The United Nations (UN) estimates that there are more than 476 million indigenous people in the world, spread across 90 countries and representing 5,000 different cultures, who make 6.2 per cent of the global population and live in all geographic regions.Like all International days and weeks, which are marked to educate the public on issues of concern, to mobilise political will and resources to address global problems, the International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples is also celebrated to recognise the contribution and achievements of indigenous communities and to highlight the plight they face in their existence.Significance of International Day of the World’s Indigenous PeoplesThe International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples was marked for the first time by UN General Assembly in December 1994, to commemorate the first meeting of the UN Working Group on Indigenous Populations of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights.The UN celebrates this day every year to “demand indigenous peoples’ inclusion, participation and approval in the constitution of a system with social and economic benefits for all”. Indigenous communities have also been disproportionately affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, whose life expectancy was already 20 years lower than that of their non-Indigenous counterparts before the pandemic hit.The UN has been working towards ushering in constitutional reforms at the international level to address the ill-treatment of indigenous communities and the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) by the General Assembly in September 2007, by a majority of 144 states in favour, was another step in the direction. Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States were the four nations who initially opposed the adoption but later reversed their decision to support the declaration.In 2022, the UN will start another milestone with the Decade of Indigenous Languages (2022-2032). It aims to conserve Indigenous languages, which helps preserve their cultures, world views and visions, as well as expressions of self-determination. The agency estimates that one indigenous language dies every two weeks.Theme this yearUN has decided on the theme of ‘Leaving no one behind: Indigenous peoples and the call for a new social contract’ for this year’s International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples. Defining social contract as an “unwritten agreement that societies make to cooperate for social and economic benefits”, the UN seeks to encourage societies to treat indigenous communities as stakeholders since they were not included in the initial social contract, which was formulated by dominant communities.It credits indigenous communities for fighting climate change and helping biodiversity flourish and asks nations to formulate a “new social contract” which “must be based on genuine participation and partnership that fosters equal opportunities and respects the rights, dignity and freedoms of all. Indigenous peoples’ right to participate in decision-making is a key component in achieving reconciliation between indigenous peoples and States”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-day-of-the-world-s-indigenous-peoples-2021-theme-significance-101628505363347.html

On August 9, 1945, the United States dropped the second nuclear bomb on Nagasaki, three days after Hiroshima was destroyed by the first one - a uranium bomb- 'Little Boy'.In his speech at the Nagasaki Peace Park on Monday, Nagasaki mayor Tomihisa Taue urged Japan, the United States and Russia to do more to eliminate nuclear weapons. He urged Japan to take the lead in creating a nuclear-free zone in Northeast Asia.History of Nagasaki Day:The bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki was code-named the 'Fat Man'. It killed over 80,000 people. This led to Japan's unconditional surrender in Second World War. At least 70,000 people were killed in the initial blast at Nagasaki, while approximately another 70,000 more died from radiation-related illnesses later. A US warplane named--Enola Gay dropped the 'Fat Man' about 1,650 feet above Nagasaki. This led to Japan's unconditional surrender in Second World War.Many survivors of the bombing developed cancer or other illnesses due to their exposure to radiation and suffered discrimination.Significance of Nagasaki Day:Nagasaki Day is being observed across the globe to promote peace and create awareness about the threat of nuclear weapons. This day plays an important role as it focuses on anti-war and anti-nuclear demonstrations in many countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nagasaki-day-know-its-history-and-significance-101628484169219.html

China does not classify them as confirmed cases.China's tally of infections stands at 93,826 since the outbreak began, while deaths stayed at 4,636.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-more-covid-19-cases-while-some-cities-kick-off-new-tests-101628484717258.html
09-08-2021||World||Taliban capture key cities in north Afghanistan, US deploys B-52 bombers||The Taliban are continuing with their offensive in Afghanistan, seizing more territory - this time in the northern part of the country - including the city of Kunduz. Taliban forces mostly overran the provincial capital city of Sar-e-Pul, also in the country's north, marking another loss for the government amid a series of unprecedented advances by the insurgent group.Taliban's actions have been criticised by the western powers as well as by people who are against the violence. Protests have been held in many cities across the world, in which people have sought United Nations' intervention and denounced Pakistan for supporting the insurgent group.At one such protest by Afghan citizens in Germany on Saturday, civil society activist Abdul Bari Samandar slammed Pakistan's proxy war through Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). The protest was organised as a Pakistani terrorist was arrested by Afghan commando forces in the outskirts of Ghazni provincial centre. He was involved in terrorist activities and the killing of civilians.The Taliban, meanwhile, said that all parts of the city of Kunduz were under its control, adding that it had also seized armoured vehicles, weapons and military equipment.Videos on social media showed huge amount of arms and ammunition seized by Taliban from security forces and house of Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum in Jawzjan province. One of the videos shows Taliban fighters loading guns, including AK-47, and other weapons looted from Dostum's house into a vehicle in Khawja Do Koh district.The former vice president last week returned from Turkey, where he was believed to be receiving medical treatment. Dostum has overseen one of the largest militias in the north (Northern Alliance) along with Ahmad Shah Massoud who was considered as Sher-e-Panjshir, which garnered a fearsome reputation in its fight against the Taliban in the 1990s.Heavy fighting between the Taliban and Afghan security forces in Kunduz on Saturday killed at least 11 civilians and wounded 40, according to health director, Dr Ehsanullah Fazli.Fighting in Afghanistan's long-running conflict began to intensify in May when the US and other foreign forces started the final stage of a withdrawal, which will complete by September 11.The Taliban already control large portions of the countryside and are now challenging Afghan government forces in several large cities.Meanwhile, 572 Taliban terrorists, including three Pakistani nationals affiliated to Al-Qaeda, were killed in airstrikes conducted by the Afghan Air Force at the outskirts of Lashkargah, Helmand provincial centre, on Sunday.On Friday too, as many as 30 Pakistani nationals, who were members of Al-Qaeda, were killed in airstrikes on Taliban targets in Helmand province.These airstrikes come a day after the Afghan Ambassador to the UN Ghulam Isaczai said on Friday that Afghanistan is prepared to provide the United Nations Security Council with material evidence in support of its claim that Pakistan is ensuring a supply chain to the Taliban.The United States has sent its B-52 bombers and Spectre gunships to Afghanistan to stop the advancement of Taliban insurgents. According to UK-based The Times, the bombers are flying into Afghanistan from an airbase in Qatar, hitting targets around Kandahar, Herat and Lashkar Gah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-capture-key-cities-in-north-afghanistan-us-sends-b-52-bombers-101628479888280.html

The steepest drop in admission was reported in kindergarten schools, the New York Times (NYT) reported citing government figures.The NYT and Stanford University analysed the enrollment data of 70,000 government schools across 33 states. The findings show that 10,000 local public schools lost at least 20 per cent of their kindergartners in 2020. The number of affected schools has increased from 4,000 from 2019 and in 2018, according to the NYT report.Further exposing the rising disparity between the rich and poor due to the coronavirus pandemic, the data analysis showed that most of the decline in admission has occurred in the areas living below or near the poverty line, according to the NYT report. The average annual income of a family of four in these areas is ₹25 lakh or less. As per the report, there has been a 28 per cent higher decline in such areas than in the rest of the country.The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has killed 4,293,530 people worldwide. In the US alone, 616,828 people have succumbed to the viral disease, while more than 35 million people have been infected.The NYT further reported that in the Philadelphia school district, where most students are already from low-income families, elementary education admissions decreased by more than 25 per cent between 2019 and 2020. Besides Philadelphia, Jackson and Honolulu were the top cities with the highest decline in kindergarten admissionsKindergarten schools are optional in many US states, however, experts say that direct education in kindergarten is beneficial for children as in these schools the conditions affecting the physical and mental development of children like autism are usually detected.The report also attributed online education as one of the key reasons for the decline in admissions. According to the research paper, there has been a 42 per cent decline in the districts where there was complete online education.Due to the increase in the infection of the Delta mutation of coronavirus, the concern of the people has increased further, according to the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-over-a-million-students-skip-admissions-in-us-kindergarten-schools-see-highest-plunge-101628475159892.html
09-08-2021||World||Anthony Fauci says Covid boosters should go ‘soon’ to the vulnerable||Anthony Fauci, the US’s top infectious-disease doctor, said he’s “strongly in favor” of speeding booster shots to people with weakened immune systems, a further sign of how the delta variant continues to shift the strategies for curbing the pandemic.“We need to look at them in a different light,” Fauci said on CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS” on Sunday. “We will almost certainly be boosting those people before we boost the general population that’s been vaccinated, and we should be doing that reasonably soon.”Fauci spoke as debate grows over “breakthrough” infections among fully vaccinated people and whether official approval should be given for booster shots. In Israel, the first nation to roll out boosters widely, more than half a million people aged 60 and over will have their third injection by the end of Sunday.Fauci said most people who have compromised immune systems, including those with organ transplants or who are on chemotherapy, “never did get an adequate response” from their Covid-19 vaccination.Across the U.S., the delta variant has fueled a rebound to more than 100,000 new infections a day, levels last seen six months ago. While the daily average number of deaths remains far below the levels of last winter, the pressure on hospitals is mounting -- the seven-day moving average for new admissions has consistently increased since June 25, according to official data.In New York and New Jersey, urgent care chain CityMD is resuming its virtual line system and adjusting operating hours to accommodate what it calls the “recent surge in Covid-19 testing.”In San Francisco, anyone who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine can get a supplemental dose of Pfizer Inc. or Moderna Inc.’s shots at city-run sites, if they wish to do so after consulting with their doctor, according to the city’s Department of Public Health.Health officials don’t take breakthrough infections “lightly,” Fauci said. More testing is needed in order to understand the exact scope of breakthrough cases, he said on CBS’ “Meet the Press.”When asked if other groups should get booster shots, Fauci said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is ready to give a recommendation as soon as they see clear evidence to do so from the data.The CDC has been tracking various groups including the elderly, those in nursing homes and young people month by month, he said. “As soon as they see that level of durability of protection goes down, then you will see the recommendation to vaccinate those individuals.”But, he stressed: “The vaccines are still doing what you originally want them to do -- to keep you out of the hospital to prevent you from getting seriously ill.”Local MandatesFauci said he also supports vaccine mandates at local levels, such as schools and universities, after a full approval from the Food and Drug Administration on the Covid-19 vaccines.“You’re going to see the empowerment of local enterprises giving mandates,” Fauci said on NBC. “That could be colleges, universities, places of business, a whole variety, and I strongly support that.”A full approval could arrive “within the next few weeks,” Fauci added. “I hope it’s within the month of August.”Vaccines in the U.S. have so far been given under emergency-use approval -- a reason some people give for refusing to be vaccinated.He said the variant presents the additional problem that vaccinated people can also transmit the virus to someone else. That has led to the CDC revising its mask guidelines recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-says-covid-boosters-should-go-soon-to-the-vulnerable-101628469915254.html
09-08-2021||World||California's Dixie wildfire is now second-worst in state history||The monstrous Dixie Fire in northern California has grown to become the second-largest wildfire in state history, authorities said Sunday, with three people reported missing and thousands fleeing the advancing flames.As of Sunday, the fire had destroyed 463,477 acres (187,562 hectares), up from the previous day's 447,723 acres. It now covers an area larger than Los Angeles.The Dixie blaze is the largest active wildfire in the United States, but one of only 11 major wildfires in California.Over the weekend, it surpassed the 2018 Mendocino Complex Fire to make it the second-worst fire in state history."It was like driving out of a war zone that you see in a movie," Tami Kugler told AFP, sitting beside her tent at an evacuation station after fleeing the historic town of Greenville before it burned down."My neighborhood is gone -- I mean gone, gone. Everybody I care and love about that's in that neighborhood, their homes are gone," she said, adding: "I didn't have insurance."On Saturday, Governor Gavin Newsom visited the charred remains of Greenville, expressing his "deep gratitude" to the teams fighting the flames.He said authorities had to devote more resources to managing forests and preventing fires.But he added that "the dries are getting a lot drier, it is hotter than it has ever been... we need to acknowledge just straight up these are climate-induced wildfires."Climate change amplifies droughts, creating ideal conditions for wildfires to spread out of control and inflict unprecedented material and environmental damage.The Dixie blaze, which on Saturday left three firefighters injured, remained 21 percent contained Sunday, unchanged from the day before, the CalFire website reported.Crews estimate the fire, which began July 13, will not finally be extinguished for two weeks.Higher temperatures forecastWeak winds and higher humidity have provided some succor to firefighters, but they are bracing for higher temperatures expected to exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) in the coming days.Heavy smoke was making driving hazardous for fire crews in some areas, and steep trails also made access difficult.The state's eight largest wildfires have all come since December 2017. The still-blackened scars of previous fires have aided Dixie Fire crews at times, reducing available fuel.Thousands of residents have fled the area, many finding temporary housing -- even living in tents, and often unsure whether their homes have survived.At an evacuation site under smoky skies in Susanville, exhausted families sat in folding chairs beside tents and vehicles packed with belongings grabbed from their abandoned homes.The Plumas County sheriff's office said it was still searching for three people listed as missing, after two others were found over the weekend.The Dixie Fire has already destroyed about 400 structures -- gutting Greenville -- and CalFire said workers and equipment were being deployed to save homes in the small town of Crescent Mills, three miles (five kilometers) southeast of Greenville.More than 5,000 personnel are now battling the Dixie blaze.Despite repeated evacuation orders from the authorities, some residents have refused to flee, preferring to try to fight the fire on their own rather than leave their property.By late July, the number of acres burned in California was up more than 250 percent from 2020 -- itself the worst year of wildfires in the state's modern history.A long-term drought that scientists say is driven by climate change has left much of the western United States and Canada parched -- and vulnerable to explosive and highly destructive fires.A preliminary investigation has suggested the Dixie Fire was started when a tree fell on a power cable owned by regional utility Pacific Gas & Company (PG&E), a private operator that was earlier blamed for the Camp Fire in 2018, which killed 86 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/californias-dixie-wildfire-is-now-second-worst-in-state-history-101628466415921.html
09-08-2021||World||Scientists are watching for new coronavirus variants as Delta continues to spread||The continued spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spawned a Greek alphabet of variants - a naming system used by the World Health Organization to track concerning new mutations of the virus that causes Covid-19. Some have equipped the virus with better ways of infecting humans or evading vaccine protection.Scientists remain focused on Delta, now the dominant variant rising rapidly around the world, but are tracking others to see what may one day take its place.DeltaThe Delta variant first detected in India remains the most worrisome. It is striking unvaccinated populations in many countries and has proven capable of infecting a higher proportion of vaccinated people than its predecessors.The WHO classifies Delta as a variant of concern, meaning it has been shown capable of increasing transmissibility, causing more severe disease or reducing the benefit of vaccines and treatments.According to Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in San Diego, Delta's "superpower" is its transmissibility. Chinese researchers found that people infected with Delta carry 1,260 times more virus in their noses compared with the original version of the coronavirus. Some U.S. research suggests that the "viral load" in vaccinated individuals who become infected with Delta is on par with those who are unvaccinated, but more research is needed.While the original coronavirus took up to seven days to cause symptoms, Delta can cause symptoms two to three days faster, giving the immune system less time to respond and mount a defense.    Delta also appears to be mutating further, with reports emerging of a "Delta Plus" variant, a sub-lineage that carries an additional mutation that has been shown to evade immune protection.India listed Delta Plus as a variant of concern in June, but neither the US Centers For Disease Control and Prevention nor the WHO have done so yet. According to Outbreak.info, an open-source Covid-19 database, Delta Plus has been detected in at least 32 countries. Experts say it is not yet clear whether it is more dangerous.Lambda – On the wane?The Lambda variant has attracted attention as a potential new threat. But this version of the coronavirus, first identified in Peru in December, may be receding, several infectious disease experts told Reuters.The WHO classifies Lambda as a variant of interest, meaning it carries mutations suspected of causing a change in transmissibility or causing more severe disease, but it is still under investigation. Lab studies show it has mutations that resist vaccine-induced antibodies.Dr. Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California, said the percentage of new Lambda cases reported to GISAID, a database that tracks SARS-CoV-2 variants, has been dropping, a sign that the variant is waning.In a recent call with the CDC, disease experts said Lambda did not appear to be causing increased transmissibility, and vaccines appear to be holding up well against it, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who attended the discussion.B.1.621 - One to watchThe B.1.621 variant, which first arose in Colombia in January, where it caused a major outbreak, has yet to earn a Greek letter name.The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control has listed it as a variant of interest, while Public Health England describes B.1.621 as a variant under investigation. It carries several key mutations, including E484K, N501Y and D614G, that have been linked with increased transmissibility and reduced immune protection. So far, there have been 37 likely and confirmed cases in the UK, according to a recent government report, and the variant has been identified in a number of patients in Florida.More on the way?Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House's chief medical adviser, recently warned that the United States could be in trouble unless more Americans get vaccinated, as a large pool of unvaccinated people give the virus more opportunity to spread and mutate into new variants.Proponents of greater international distribution of vaccine doses by rich countries say the same thing could happen as variants emerge unchecked among the populations of poor nations where very few people have been inoculated.Even so, a key issue is that the current vaccines block severe disease but do not prevent infection, said Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccine scientist at the Mayo Clinic. That is because the virus is still capable of replicating in the nose, even among vaccinated people, who can then transmit the disease through tiny, aerosolized droplets.To defeat SARS-CoV-2, he said, will likely require a new generation of vaccines that also block transmission. Until then, the world will remain vulnerable to the rise of new coronavirus variants, according to Poland and other experts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-are-watching-for-new-coronavirus-variants-as-delta-continues-to-spread-101628465637901.html
09-08-2021||World||Covid-19: Beijing imposes travel curbs to tackle outbreak||China’s capital city on Sunday stepped up measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus cases by virtually banning people from travelling to Beijing from provinces with high Covid-19 transmission rates.Beijing has rolled out a range of measures to strengthen the management of personnel returning from the most affected regions, including imposing restrictions on their purchase of railway tickets and air services, Global Times reported.People from medium or high-risk regions or planning to return to Beijing but have a travel history related to these regions will be prevented from buying tickets for air and railway services. If they choose to drive into the Chinese capital, they will also be persuaded to make a U-turn and leave, the paper said.The Global Times report said health codes for people who are in medium and high-risk regions will be adjusted to the yellow colour, and anyone with a health code that is not green will not be allowed to board planes or trains bound for Beijing. Presenting a green health code will be a must.The Chinese mainland on Saturday reported about 150 cases from several provinces including Jiangsu, Henan, Yunnan, Hubei and Hunan, according to the National Health Commission.Top health official says US is ‘failing’ on Covid-19With the US recording its highest daily caseload in six months, a top public health official said the country is “failing”. “We shouldn’t really have ever got to the place we are,” Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, told ABC. “We are failing.” The total daily new cases have surged to 118,000, the highest since February; deaths are up 89% over the past two weeks.Tokyo, which hosted the Olympics, saw over 4,000 new cases in the past 24 hours. The daily spike in cases topped the mark for the fifth straight day.Saudi Arabia said it will begin accepting vaccinated foreign pilgrims seeking to visit the holy city of Mecca, around 18 months after a border closure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-beijing-imposes-travel-curbs-to-tackle-outbreak-101628462070524.html

Till August 9, the rainfall across the state has been 484.8 mm, which is 28 per cent less. While Jajpur district has seen the maximum deviation with 57 per cent less rainfall, Puri has seen the minimum deviation from the average expected rainfall.Agriculture department officials said the lack of rain has affected agricultural activities with 19.97 lakh hectare area farmland being sown with paddy till July 31 compared to 25.22 lakh last year. Similarly, the total crop coverage till July end was 35.86 lakh hectares compared to 41.49 lakh hectares last year.State revenue minister Sudam Marndi said the government was hopeful of improvement in rainfall this month. “We are monitoring the situation and are well prepared for any drought-like eventuality. There are still possibilities of rain. Our government is always with the farmers and working towards their betterment,” Marndi said.Odisha had last experienced drought in 2018 in nine districts of the state, most of them from western Odisha where farmers suffered crop losses of 33 per cent and above due to moisture stress in the districts. In 2015, at least 25 of the 30 districts had experienced drought due to an erratic southwest monsoon.Met officials said the erratic rainfall during the current monsoon was the reason for the deficiency. Though as many as four low-pressure systems were formed over the Bay of Bengal, only one could have a good impact on the state. The weather office said the monsoon core zone regions; including Odisha will not witness widespread rainfall in the next two weeks.In Ganjam district, villagers are resorting to frog dance hoping that it will bring rain. In Chikiti block of Ganjam, people are bathing frogs with turmeric water and smearing them with vermillion before tying them to a pole. The villagers believe that the croaking sound of the frogs will lead to rainfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-farmers-stare-at-possible-drought-as-21-districts-get-deficient-rainfall-101628532856925.html

09-08-2021||India||5 principles needed for global maritime security, says PM Modi as he chairs UNSC meet||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday proposed five principles to ensure global maritime security, including responsible connectivity and peaceful resolution of disputes, as he chaired a UN Security Council debate that was joined by Russian President Vladimir Putin and US secretary of state Antony Blinken. India’s presidential statement on maritime security, which contained a tacit reference to China’s aggressive actions in the South China Sea by calling for ensuring the freedom of navigation in accordance with international laws, was adopted by the Security Council despite China holding out till the last minute, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The rotating presidency of the Security Council is held by India for August and this was the first standalone discussion on maritime security by the UN’s highest body. India adopted a consensus building approach by initiating consultations among all Security Council members several months in advance and prepared a concept note that incorporated ideas of all members. Modi, who became the first Indian premier to chair a meeting of the Security Council, called for a cooperative framework to deal with maritime disputes, climate change and natural disasters. He proposed five principles to develop a roadmap for global maritime security in his address in Hindi. The principles are removing barriers from legitimate maritime trade, encouraging responsible maritime connectivity, settling maritime disputes through peaceful means and on the basis of international law, jointly facing natural disasters and maritime threats created by non-state actors, and preserving the maritime environment and resources. Modi highlighted steps taken by India in this context, including creating the maritime information fusion centre, responding to maritime disasters in the region, and settling the maritime boundary with Bangladesh, and said such measures help build cooperation and trust. The debate on maritime security was one of three signature events being organised by India during its presidency of the Security Council – the other two will focus on counter-terrorism and peacekeeping – and the presidential statement was the first outcome document by the UN body on maritime security. The presidential statement has to be adopted unanimously, but the process was not smooth as China held out till the very end because of language related to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the people cited above said. Indian negotiators helped find language acceptable to all members without dropping the reference to UNCLOS, which the four other permanent members of the Security Council insisted on retaining, the people added. The presidential statement focused on the primacy of international law, noting UNCLOS is the legal framework for all activities in the oceans, including countering illicit activities at sea. It also highlighted the importance of enhancing global and regional cooperation to counter threats to maritime safety and security. The statement promotes safe and secure shipping while ensuring freedom of navigation in line with international laws, and welcomes mutual legal assistance and other types of law enforcement cooperation on transnational organised crime. It calls for strengthening cooperation for maritime security, including against piracy and terrorist activities, as well as against transnational organised crimes. It also seeks enhanced cooperation to protect critical infrastructure, including cross-border infrastructure Blinken, in his address, referred to India’s leadership on issues such as a free and open Indo-Pacific and collaborative efforts such as the maritime fusion centre that has enhanced cooperation among Indian Ocean partners. The freedom of navigation and overflight and unimpeded flow of maritime commerce is critical to security of nations but there are also critical areas where maritime rules are under threat, such as the South China Sea, he said. Without naming China, Blinken said the South China Sea had witnessed dangerous encounters, “provocative actions to advance unlawful maritime claims” and to intimidate and bully states. “When nations ignore or purport to redraw the borders of other nations, whether by land or by sea, they undermine the sovereign equality of member states – a guiding principle of the UN,” he added. China’s deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dai Bing, sought to counter Blinken’s remarks by saying a “few countries are pursuing exclusive regional strategies in Asia-Pacific in an attempt to create and intensify maritime conflict” and weaken regional stability. He opposed the mention of the South China Sea and accused the US of “stirring up trouble out of nothing”. Putin said Russia wants to build productive cooperation with the Indian Ocean Rim Association and Indian Ocean Commission and help ensure security in the Persian Gulf and Atlantic Ocean. He called for a special structure within UN to fight maritime crimes in various regions. Putin respect for sovereignty and settle disputes through dialogue Russia wants to build productive cooperation with the Indian Ocean Rim Association and Indian Ocean Commission, help ensure security in Persian Gulf, Atlantic Ocean united under UN special abilities armed contingents of states, Russia to share experiences of anti-terrorist ops, think about special structure within UN to fight maritime crimes in various regions, supported by member states, Four heads of state and government, including Modi and 10 ministers participated in the debate, including French foreign minister Jean-Yves le Drian and UK defence secretary Ben Wallace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-principles-needed-for-global-maritime-security-says-pm-modi-as-he-chairs-unsc-meet-101628527337014.html
09-08-2021||India||One year after Kerala landslide, survivors move HC for better land, houses||A year after a massive landslide decimated a tea plantation workers colony in Pettimudi in Idukki district killing 70 people, relatives of the deceased on Monday, moved the Kerala High Court with a plea to allot land and houses in proper areas. In their plea they said some of the allotted land and houses were in remote areas without motor-able roads and they needed a proper dwelling which ensured proper commuting and a hassle-free life. The High Court later sent notices to the state government and the Kannan Devan Hill Plantation (KDHP). Most of those who died in the landslide last year were employees working with the KDHP when the tragedy occurred. Survivors want the government to take over “excess land” occupied by the KDHP and distribute them to the landless. After the accident, the Kerala government announced that houses would be built for those hit by the tragedy under the Life Mission project. But many inhabitants said most of the houses were situated in inhospitable locations and they found it difficult to lead a normal life. Tragedy struck Pettimudi on the night of August 6 last year when after incessant rain, a portion of the hill came down destroying a settlement of tea plantation workers. People living in nearby areas got to know about the accident only the next day. Some of the bodies were recovered nearly 14 km away from the landslide site. Only 64 bodies were recovered and last week a special order was issued by the state government certifying that the missing were also dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-year-after-kerala-landslide-survivors-move-hc-for-better-land-houses-101628525716497.html
09-08-2021||India||Latest on CoWin: Foreigners’ registration, Covid vaccine certificate on WhatsApp||India has administered more than 508.6 million vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) till 7am on Monday. Of these, a total of 1,611,590 were administered to people in the previous 24 hours. Under the nationwide vaccination drive, started in January this year and the universalisation of the programme in June, anyone aged 18 and above can receive the Covid-19 vaccines. On Monday, the Centre announced that foreign nationals living in India can also get the Covid-19 vaccine by registering on the CoWIN platform as all other eligible people.What is CoWin platform?CoWIN or Covid Vaccine Intelligence Work was introduced by the central government in January when the nationwide vaccination campaign was first launched in the country. It is the platform on which those eligible have to register themselves using their valid identification documents to get Covid-19 vaccines. There is an independent mobile application as well. People can get their vaccination certificates from CoWin, although now the Centre has said that the document can be received on WhatsApp.Is CoWin platform available in other countries?Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a CoWin Global Conclave last month, wherein as many as 50 countries who showed interest in CoWin were given an opportunity to adopt it. These countries include Canada, Nigeria, Uganda and Mexico among others.At the conclave, PM Modi said technology is “integral” to the fight against Covid-19 and that “luckily, software is one area in which there are no resource constraints.” He cited this as the reason India made its Covid-19 tracing and tracking app open source as it was “technically feasible.” In a statement at the time, the National Health Authority (NHA) said that India is “excited to join hands with the world to win over Covid-19 together with CoWin.”Who’s eligible to register on CoWin?When the nationwide vaccination drive had begun in January, it was open for healthcare workers only and later extended to frontline workers from February 2 onwards. Eventually, the people aged above 60 and above 45 with co-morbidities were also permitted to receive the jabs. In April, the Centre announced that from May 1 onwards, all Indian citizens aged 18 and above will be allowed to get administered the coronavirus vaccine as part of an accelerated phase-3 of the drive. The announcement came after PM Modi chaired a high-level meeting with concerned officials.Can pregnant women and children also register on CoWin?On July 2, the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) said that pregnant women can now also get vaccinated against Covid-19. Citing the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation's (NTAGI) recommendations, the Centre said that pregnant women can register themselves on the CoWin platform and are also allowed to take jabs by walking in at the nearest Covid-19 Vaccination Centre (CVC).Also Read | Health ministry allows Covid-19 vaccination for pregnant womenHowever, at the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) Parliamentary Meet on July 27, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya reportedly said that India will likely start vaccinating children against the virus from August. Currently, children are not allowed to get administered with Covid-19 vaccines.What is the latest development pertaining to the CoWin platform?According to a statement by the MoHFW, foreign nationals residing in India can also register on the CoWin app to get Covid-19 jabs. “They can use their passport as an identity document for the purpose of registration on the CoWin portal. Once they are registered on this portal, they will get a slot for vaccination,” the health ministry statement read.Also Read | Foreign nationals now eligible for Covid-19 vaccination in India: Health ministryMandaviya also took to Twitter to share the news. “Together We Fight, Together We Win Clapping hands sign Govt has now allowed foreign nationals residing in India to register on the CoWin portal and take #COVID19 vaccine. This will ensure overall safety from the transmission of the virus,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/latest-on-cowin-foreigners-registration-covid-vaccine-certificate-on-whatsapp-101628524255977.html

Jai Hind!”The latest petition also comes close on the wheels of Karnataka BJP MLA CT Ravi requesting chief minister Basavaraj Bommai to rename Indira Canteens across the state as "Annapoorneshwari Canteen".“Don't see any reason why Kannadigas should be reminded of the dark days of Emergency while they are having food,” he further wrote.Renaming of public spaces and stadiums across the country has turned into a heated controversy with the ruling and BJP and Opposition hitting out at each other over the latest moves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-residents-petition-govt-for-renaming-rajiv-gandhi-national-park-101628519350382.html
09-08-2021||India||Chhattisgarh recognises tribal community rights in urban area||In a first, the Chhattisgarh government has recognised the Community Forest Resource (CFR) rights in an urban area and in core area of a tiger reserve.A committee headed by district collector can recognise individual and community rights of tribals over forest land, except core areas of tiger habitat, where prior approval of the forest department is needed. Most of the tribal rights have been recognised in rural areas.This would be the first instance of tribals living in urban areas getting their community right recognised. This means as a community they would have grazing and harvesting rights in the nearby forest. The Forest Rights Act, 2006, provides for individual as well as community forest rights, according to forest officials.

According to a state government order, the rights recognised in municipal areas are spread over an area of 707.41 hectares for ward sabha Nagari, 678.18 hectares for ward sabha Churiyara and 2,746.742 hectares for ward sabha Tumbahara. The government also recognised the community forest resource rights of five villages over 13,700 acres of forest which is spread within the core area of Sitanadi Udanti Tiger Reserve spanning across two districts of Dhamtari and Gariyaband.

These ward sabhas and gram sabhas would be able to protect, conserve, regenerate and mange the entire forest area falling within the aforesaid traditional boundary” an senior official working with chief minister’s office said. Principal chief conservator of forests Rakesh Chaturvedi said this is an important step for empowering forest dwellers of the state. “Soon, community forest resource rights in other urban areas, where needed, will be recognized by the government,” he said.

PM Modi, while chairing a high-level United Nations Security Council (UNSC) debate, said that "prosperity of all" is dependent on the active flow of maritime trade and urged for peaceful settlement of disputes and according to international law. "This is very important for mutual trust and confidence. This is the only way we can ensure global peace and stability," he said."The ocean is our common heritage. Our sea routes are the lifeline of international trade. And, the biggest thing is that these seas are very important for the future of our planet. But this shared maritime heritage of ours is facing many challenges today," the Prime Minister said as he chaired the debate virtually in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. “We need to face natural disasters and maritime threats created by non-state actors together,” he said.Also read | Russian president Vladimir Putin to attend Modi’s UNSC debatePM Modi pointed out that India has taken several steps to enhance regional cooperation on this subject.

09-08-2021||India||Online classes may leave trail of health issues, says Kerala education minister||Frequent online classes may lead to many health problems for students, Kerala education minister V Sivankutty said in the state assembly quoting a study conducted by the state council of education research and training. The minister said 36 per cent students have neck pain, 28 per cent complained of eye ailments and 22 per cent reported anxiety and stress. Digital classes cannot be the norm, he elaborated. He said the Kerala government is waiting for the Centre’s directive to open schools and a final decision would be taken soon. It is planning to open classes for senior students but the high volume of Covid-19 cases has left it in a quandary. Neighbouring Tamil Nadu and Karnataka earlier announced their plan to open educational institutions in a structured manner. Like the rest of the country, educational institutions were closed in the state in March 2020 but classes started later through the online medium and it has been continuing for more than one and a half years now. “We can’t continue online classes forever. Our study shows students suffer from some ailment or the other due to online classes. We have to go back to the old system as soon as possible,” he said in the assembly. The minister also mentioned that to reduce mental stress due to Covid-19 related issues students would be given free counselling. “We have to make parents also aware of the inherent dangers of the overuse of the internet. We will give training to them also. Many non-government bodies have come forward,” he said. “Schools will reopen in different phases. We have to inoculate students before reopening. We will ensure a smooth opening after meeting all norms,” he said. Many experts are of the opinion that strict adult guidance or monitoring is needed for internet use by small children and parents will have to lay down ground rules for usage of the internet to avoid overexposure and exploitation. Some parents also complained that after each class, schools often take a long break keeping children glued to the screen for long. “Strict parental guideline is needed for small children. They have to ensure a balance between the use of gadgets and avoiding their harmful effects,” said P Niveditha, a teacher, adding parents will have to keep a strict vigil.“The digital world opens a new vista for students. But they will have to be careful. Children with behavioural issues can spin into gadget addiction rapidly,” said child psychologist Dr T V Anil Kumar. He said online classes will leave a spectre of screen addiction in many children. Many students also admitted that online classes can’t be compared to traditional classes which help them to embrace many qualities. Besides this another danger lurks in the form of digital classes, complained teachers and parents. Some anti-social elements have started hacking and posting vulgar posts in groups meant for online classes. At least 51 such complaints surfaced in the state in the last three months and cyber security experts said a majority of such posts are created outside the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/online-classes-may-leave-trail-of-health-issues-says-kerala-education-minister-101628514556091.html

He also asked whether the government had any plan to continue these reservations in CPSUs, particularly BPCL, after disinvestment.Responding to Chidambaram, the minister of state for finance Bhagwat Kisanrao Karad said that “reservation policy is applicable only in government companies” and since post disinvestment, a company ceases to be a government subsidiary, the reservation policy will not apply.Also Read | Govt to push legislation in final week of session“Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) being the nodal department for disinvestment matters has informed that the reservation policy is applicable only in government companies and after strategic disinvestment of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), it will not remain a government company,” the minister informed Chidambaram.About the total figures of people from reserved categories who work in CPSUs, the minister said among the 919,479 employees in CPSUs, nearly 160,384 come from scheduled caste backgrounds and account for over 17% of the total employees. Nearly 99,693 people are from scheduled tribe backgrounds and account for over 10% of total employees. Apart from these two, 198,581 people are also employed from the OBC category in the CPSUs, as per the government.Cumulatively, these reserved category employees form 49.8% of the total employees in CPSUs.The current government has been guided by the principle of privatisation with a resolve of “minimum government and maximum governance.” Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, on February 1, 2021, had announced an elaborate roadmap for privatisation of PSUs in this fiscal year.“In spite of Covid-19, we have kept working towards strategic disinvestment. A number of transactions namely BPCL, Air India, Shipping Corporation of India, Container Corporation of India, IDBI Bank, BEML, Pawan Hans, Neelachal Ispat Nigam limited among others would be completed in 2021-22,” she had said in her budget speech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disinvestment-of-psus-will-lead-to-loss-of-quota-jobs-govt-in-lok-sabha-101628513295760.html

The couple was later rushed to government medical college in Anantnag where doctors declared them brought dead.Sixty-five-year-old Dar was the Kulgam district president of BJP Kisan Morcha and a sarpanch. His wife was also a panch from the same village. BJP’s J&K spokesperson Altaf Thakur condemned the killings and said, “He (Dar) was without security and lived in a rented accommodation.

09-08-2021||India||2022 assembly polls: U'khand BJP may field new faces to replace sitting MLAs||With several months left for the next assembly elections to be held next year, the ruling BJP in Uttarakhand has started brainstorming over the distribution of tickets to nominees. It is also expected that the party will deny tickets to some of its sitting MLAs over “poor performance”.The decision is being contemplated by the BJP leadership following an internal survey by the party on the performance of its MLAs in the past four and a half years.According to people privy to the development, the survey was being conducted “since the last three-four months to evaluate the performance of MLAs before the party leadership could decide on distribution of tickets.”“Based on the preliminary results of the survey, the BJP is unlikely to give tickets again to at least 20 MLAs who have failed to perform so far. It seems the people in their constituencies are also unhappy with them. The party leadership is not willing to take any risk with them in the 2022 assembly elections,” a BJP leader said.The development is significant considering the fact that the BJP had a thumping majority in the last assembly elections in which it won 57 out of the total 70 seats which is the best performance by any party in the Himalayan state.“However, the party leadership is somewhat aware that it will not be a cakewalk for them in 2022 as it might not be able to win as many seats again. Hence, it is likely to give tickets to young people instead on the 20 seats where the sitting MLAs have been unable to perform,” said the leader.BJP state unit in-charge Dushyant Kumar Gautam, however, refused to speak on the internal survey but said, “The 2022 elections will not be fought on any individual’s face but on the party symbol.”“BJP while in power has done a lot of public welfare work and brought in policies for the same. The party will fight the polls on the basis of those and we are sure that the people of the state will once again support us,” said Gautam.He also hit out at the Opposition Congress by accusing it of “looting the country”.“Congress has always looted the country whenever it was voted to power. It is only the BJP that has been working for the comprehensive development of the country. In the previous assembly elections in 2017, Congress leader Harish Rawat who was called a big challenge, lost on both the seats where he fought. This time too, the Congress will meet a similar fate,” said Gautam.The state Congress meanwhile, termed the BJP’s internal survey its “nervousness” ahead of polls.“The BJP in the last four and a half years of tenure has done no work except bringing three CMs which is an insult to the people of the state which handed it a thumping majority in 2017. They are just using the state as a laboratory for their politics while having no regard for its people,” said Congress MLA and party national secretary Qazi Nizamuddin.Nizamuddin said, “The people this time are waiting to teach the BJP a lesson for their arrogance. It has failed on every aspect including unemployment, price rise, farmers’ issues and others. It won’t matter whether they give tickets to their sitting MLAs or not because they will have a tough time in 2022.”Political analysts too said that the 2022 elections won’t be a cakewalk at all for the BJP like in 2017.MM Semwal political analyst and professor of political science in Garhwal Central University in Srinagar said, “The 2022 assembly elections are not going to be easy for the BJP unlike the previous one because people especially the youth are angry over the employment issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-bjp-likely-to-field-new-faces-to-replace-sitting-mlas-for-2022-assembly-polls-101628511075532.html

Gonsalves has said proposed changes to his country’s public health law wouldn’t include penalties for those who refuse Covid-19 shots. He also said there was no justification for the attack. “We can have our disagreements, but to cross the line into violence is unacceptable in a democratic society,” he said.

Instead of fighting an ideology with a better idea it is crushing contrarian thought with an iron fist,” she said in a tweet.Mufti said such “oppressive” measures may seem to work temporarily. “But in the long run it will prove to be counterproductive. The gulf between J&K and the rest of the country widens with every passing day. It is a self goal,” she said.Meanwhile , the NIA, along with J&K Police and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) conducted searches at five places in Kashmir’s northern district of Bandipora. “Searches conducted today included the premises of office bearers and members of the proscribed association, JeI. During the searches, various incriminating documents and electronic devices were seized from the premises of the suspects “ the agency said in a statement. The NIA on Sunday raided 56 locations linked to the alleged members of the banned JeI group across 14 districts in J&K as part of its probe in an alleged terror funding case.Also Read | BJP leader Gulam Rasool Dar, his wife shot dead by terrorists in J&K’s AnantnagThe Centre banned the JeI for five years after the Pulwama attack in which 40 CRPF troops were killed, under anti-terror laws on the grounds that it was “in close touch” with terror outfits and was likely to “escalate secessionist movement” in the region.A notification, banning the group under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, was issued by the ministry of home affairs in February 2019, months before the special status of J&K was revoked and the region split into two Union Territories.The NIA searches on Sunday covered the premises of JeI office bearers, members and also offices of trusts purportedly run by the outfit.The NIA added that during the searches held across all the districts of Kashmir and four districts of Jammu “various incriminating documents and electronic devices were seized from the premises of the suspects”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/niaraids-on-jamaat-e-islami-centre-s-self-goal-says-pdp-chief-mehbooba-mufti-101628509155744.html

09-08-2021||India||Uproar in MP assembly; Opposition demands restoration of tribal day holiday||The Congress on Monday staged a protest in Madhya Pradesh assembly demanding that the state holiday on World Tribal Day on August 9 be restored.On the first day of monsoon session, the Opposition leaders staged protest in the well of the House, accusing the BJP-led state government for insulting tribal by taking away their rights of celebrating the day.The International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples was marked for the first time by UN General Assembly in December 1994. But in the state, it was only in 2019 that then Congress-led state government announced a public holiday on August 9 and also allocated budget to every district to organise programmes.Leader of Opposition in the state assembly, Kamal Nath, said, “The BJP-led state government cancelled the holiday and changed to an optional leave. The state government has not allocated any budget for celebration. It is harassing tribals and working against them.”“Atrocities against people of our community have increased...We will not allow injustice,” said tribal leader and Congress MLA Hiralal Alawa.Also Read | Flood-hit Rajasthan, MP announce aid; rain continues in northAmid protest, Congress leaders walked out of the House and sat on dharna outside the assembly. Later, the House was adjourned for the day.Hitting back at the Congress, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, “It is an optional holiday but it has become a habit of the Congress to do indecent politics. Today, they insulted the departed soul of tribal leader Kalavati Bhuria and others by not paying tribute to them.”“The BJP doesn’t need any certificate from Congress about how much they care about tribals. We will observe Janjati Gaurav Diwas on November 15 on Birsa Munda’s birth anniversary,” he said.Meanwhile, BJP Member of Parliament Gajendra Patel, who is also the national general of BJP Scheduled Tribe Morcha, claimed that the World Tribal Day is a conspiracy by those who want to convert tribals into Christians.“People of the tribal community celebrate so many festivals but some anti-national organisations and missionaries focus on August 9 as World Tribal Day to misguide and convert them. They organise programmes to attract tribal towards their religion on the pretext of providing help, medical aid, and education,” he said.Jai Adiwasi Yuva Sangathan protested against Patel’s statement. JAYS general secretary Dr Anand Rai said, “The state government and its leaders are insensitive towards tribals. The UN has declared it the World Tribal Day. It has nothing to do with politics. The government first scrapped the holiday and now, a BJP MP is calling it a conspiracy. They remember tribals only at the time of elections.”We will intensify our protest if World Tribal Day state holiday is not restored. Madhya Pradesh has 15.31 million tribal population which constitutes more than 21% of total population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uproar-in-mp-assembly-opposition-demands-restoration-of-tribal-day-holiday-101628507775321.html

The farmers will not seek any further permission from the Delhi Police to extend the agitation, a functionary of the farmers’ collective said.The 'Kisan Sansad', called by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmers' unions, will also call for the resignation of the Modi government for not repealing the contentious farm laws.Around 200 farmers had been camping at the Jantar Mantar for the ‘Kisan Sansad’ since July 22 when the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament began. This was an extension of their months-long agitation along the borders of Delhi seeking a repeal of three Central farm laws. This protest will, however, continue, said an office-bearer of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), a part of the SKM, said“The farmers' unions through their 'Kisan Sansad' will pass a 'no confidence motion' for the government, demanding resignation of the BJP-led dispensation. This government no longer deserves the trust of the people, including the farmers, and has no right to continue in power,” BKU media in-charge Dharmendra Malik said.The Delhi Police had granted permission for the protest at Jantar Mantar from July 22 till August 9 with a maximum of 200 protesters at the site.A senior police officer said, "Today is the last day of the protest by farmers at Jantar Mantar here. As per permission given, they held their protest peacefully for all these days and will leave Jantar Mantar after their protest this (Monday) evening."The protestors, otherwise, have stayed put at Delhi's border points of Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur since November 2020 with a demand that the Centre repeal the three farm laws introduced last year.“On this very day (August 9) several years ago, Indians had called for the British to quit India. Today, we are calling for the BJP to leave (the seat of) power,” Malik said, referring to the landmark 1942 episode of the national freedom movement.“We are not going to seek any further permission for the protest at Jantar Mantar because the government is just not concerned. We will pass the 'no confidence motion' against it and return to the (Delhi) borders where protest will continue until our demands are met,” he added.In parliamentary parlance, a government can be in power only as long as it commands a mandate in Lok Sabha. In the event of a no-confidence motion against it, the government has to prove its majority in the directly-elected house.The 'Kisan Sansad', a symbolic body created by the demonstrators at the Jantar Mantar under the banner of the SKM, was held to protest against the Centre over the contentious laws amid the ongoing monsoon session of parliament.Hundreds of farmers are encamped at Delhi's borders since November 2020 with a demand that the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 be rolled back and a new law made to guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for crops.However, the government, which has held 11 rounds of formal dialogue with the protestors, has maintained that the laws are pro-farmer.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kisan-sansad-to-end-at-jantar-mantar-today-stir-at-delhi-borders-to-continue-101628506791880.html

In a statement, MHA said that flags made of non-biodegradable items do not decompose for a long time and make their appropriate disposal a practical problem.The home ministry stated that the tricolour represents the hopes and aspirations of the country; hence should occupy a position of honour.“There is universal affection and respect for, and loyalty to, the national flag. Yet, a perceptible lack of awareness is often noticed amongst people as well as organisations or agencies of the government, in regard to laws, practices and conventions that apply to display of the national flag,” the statement read.The MHA said that tricolours made of plastic are being used during important national, sports and cultural events instead of those made of paper. The states and UTs have thus been asked to make sure that people use national flags made of paper only on the occasions of such important sports, cultural and national events in terms of the provisions of the Flag Code of India, 2002, and that these paper flags are “not discarded or thrown on the ground after the event.”The paper flags are required to be disposed of, “in private, consistent with the dignity of the flag,” the MHA statement read. The home ministry letter addressing the states and UTs was issued alongside a copy of the 'Flag Code of India, 2002’, and ‘The Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971’.Such statements by the Centre have been issued previously as well.Also Read | Congress to hold year-long celebrations to mark 75 yrs of IndependenceMeanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has sought suggestions and ideas from people for his Independence Day speech this year.

09-08-2021||India||Bangladesh, Mauritius and Seychelles to join regional maritime security grouping||Bangladesh, Mauritius and Seychelles are set to become full members of the Colombo Security Conclave, a grouping of India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives that focuses on maritime security, counter-terrorism and disaster relief. The three countries were invited to join the grouping during the first meeting of deputy national security advisers of the Colombo Security Conclave that was hosted virtually by Sri Lanka last week. Bangladesh, Mauritius and Seychelles currently have observer status with the grouping, which was earlier known as the NSA Trilateral on Maritime Security and was revived in November last year. The three observer states are expected to become full members at the next meeting of national security advisers that will be organised in the Maldives later this year, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The widening of areas of cooperation and expansion of the conclave’s membership to Bangladesh, Mauritius and Seychelles indicate growing convergence among Indian Ocean region countries to work together on a common platform and to deepen their engagement under a regional framework, the people said. Maritime security and countering terrorism and other crimes in the Indian Ocean has emerged as a focus area for India as part of its Indo-Pacific strategy and the doctrine of Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR). The virtual meeting of the deputy NSAs hosted by Sri Lanka on August 4 focused on the security of regional maritime operations, threat perceptions, prevention of smuggling of contraband, piracy, close trilateral cooperation for further enhancing the response to security concerns and illegal activities on the seas, according to a statement from the Sri Lankan military. Also Read | Deterioration in security situation in Afghanistan is serious, says JaishankarThe people cited above said all the members of the conclave expressed a desire to cooperate in maritime safety and security through joint exercises involving navies and coast guard forces. Sri Lanka and Maldives conveyed their expectations and desire of aid from India on maritime and security issues, and the India side assured them of its full assistance, the people added. In light of recent maritime accidents in the Indian Ocean region that resulted in pollution, such as the incidents involving MV Xpress Pearl, MT New Diamond and MV Wakashio, the members discussed ways to tackle marine pollution. Cooperation in dealing with terrorism and radicalisation was also discussed, the people said. The conclave was initiated by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2011, when he was serving as defence secretary, as a platform for trilateral maritime security cooperation between India, the Maldives and Sri Lanka. Since the grouping was revived in 2020, a secretariat has been established in Colombo. During the meeting of the NSAs last year, the grouping decided to expand its overall ambit to maritime and security cooperation, and to focus on countering terrorism and extremism, trans-national crimes such as narcotics, weapons and human trafficking, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief and protecting the maritime environment. Last week’s meeting of the deputy national security advisers was chaired by Gen Shavendra Silva, Chief of Defence Staff of Sri Lanka, and it was joined by Indian deputy national security adviser Pankaj Saran and Aishath Nooshin Waheed, secretary in the Maldives NSA’s office. Bangladesh, Mauritius and Seychelles were represented by Lt Gen Waker-ul Zaman, personal staff officer, armed forces division, prime minister’s office, Pusmawatee Sohun, permanent secretary, prime minister’s office, and Col Michael Rosette, chief of defence forces, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bangladesh-mauritius-and-seychelles-to-join-regional-maritime-security-grouping-101628503515228.html
09-08-2021||India||Gujarat govt’s decision to remodel Sabarmati Ashram 'shocking': Gehlot||Opposing the plan of redeveloping Sabarmati Ashram in Gujarat, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday said it is a shocking, uncalled for and politically-driven decision taken by the Gujarat government. He also suggested that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should intervene and ask the state administration to reconsider the move.“The decision of the Gujarat government to build a museum by demolishing Sabarmati Ashram is shocking and uncalled for. People come to visit this holy site to see how Gandhiji lived a simple life and yet orchestrated an enormous freedom movement by including every section of society, particularly at a time when the society was extremely divided. He has spent 13 years of his valuable life in the Ashram,” Gehlot said in a series of tweets.The Gujarat government’s proposed ₹1200-crore Gandhi Ashram Memorial and Precinct Development Project aims to redevelop Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad, where Mahatma Gandhi lived for 13 years, to bring it closer to its original state, when it was established by Gandhi in 1917 on the bank of the Sabarmati river. It is also believed in some quarters that several non-heritage structures in the 35-acre complex will be demolished as part of the overhaul. Over a hundred eminent personalities recently opposed the project, alleging that it is an attempt to take over Gandhian institutions.The Rajasthan chief minister said Sabarmati Ashram is known for its harmony and ideas of fraternity. People from within the country or abroad don’t wish to see any world-class buildings over there. Visitors admire the simplicity and the ideals of the place - that’s why it is called an Ashram - not a place which can be called a Museum.“Destroying the sanctity and dignity of the ashram is showing disrespect to our Father of the Nation. It seems that the decision is driven by a political motive to change everything that is related to Gandhiji. Any such action will go down in history and generations to come will not forgive those who tried to destroy our rich heritage, culture and traditions. Prime Minister Narendra Modi must intervene and reconsider the decision and protect the historical Ashram,” he wrote in a post on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shocking-says-ashok-gehlot-on-gujarat-govt-s-decision-to-remodel-sabarmati-ashram-101628500694911.html

(ABIL) and its other group companies. Bhosale is the promoter of the ABIL group, ED stated on Monday.

The FIR said this land could only be transferred to the government or commissioned officers as per the primary condition imposed at the time of its allotment in 1951, ED said in a statement.The anti-money laundering agency has been carrying out the investigation in the Pune land grabbing case since last year and has also questioned Bhosale and his son Amit for several hours.The father-son duo is accused of developing a commercial property on the said land which was meant for bureaucrats. During the investigation, ED has also carried out search and seizure operations at various places and seized incriminating documents, corroborating the allegations made in the FIR, ED said.In June, ED had attached assets worth ₹40.34 crore belonging to Bhosale and his family for alleged violations of Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema), 1999.ED investigation against Bhosale began in September 2017 following reliable inputs that the family had acquired an immovable property in Dubai in contravention of Fema. ED’s further probe revealed that Bhosale acquired foreign securities of a Dubai company, which held the property.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-attaches-pune-businessman-avinash-bhosale-s-group-corporate-office-building-101628499014578.html

Punjab Police chief Dinkar Gupta said the cops in the state are working with central agencies on the case."We believe the IEDs and grenades were delivered through drones from across the border. These are highly sophisticated and remote controlled devices, activated through batteries," Gupta said. He, however, refused to name the target.The IEDs were found in Daleke village on Sunday.Gupta did not name any terror group in Monday's press conference, but said that the police are aware of "who is doing what", adding that a major terror bid has been foiled."We are working with central agencies like the NIA and BSF," added Gupta.The DGP also said that people, while travelling in buses or public transport, should make sure to check their surroundings for suspicious items and inform the police if any such thing is spotted.The recovery of these arms and ammunition is significant in weeks before the Independence Day, when the security apparatus across the country is in a heightened state of alertness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ieds-recovered-in-punjab-border-village-dgp-says-delivered-through-drones-101628495170073.html

It also asked for the data to be widely publicised. The plea also challenged the vaccine mandates that forced people to be compulsorily vaccinated or lose their livelihood."In India, the manner in which the vaccines have been licensed vitiates and even precludes the possibility that the vaccines can be evaluated objectively in the future. Under these circumstances the petitioner is forced to appeal to this court for public disclosure of trial data and post-vaccination data, as required by international medical norms," the plea stated.Also Read: Supreme Court notice to Centre, Delhi govt on plea for vaccination of beggars"In other countries, this type of observation has helped identify the occurrence of blood clots and strokes in vaccine recipients," the plea further said, adding that many countries stopped administering the vaccine till they evaluated this occurrence. "Countries like Denmark have completely banned the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine (branded as Covishield in India)."The Supreme Court made it clear that it does not want to send “a signal on the safety of vaccines” as the country was already battling vaccine hesitancy, and pondering on safety of vaccines as it may create doubts in the minds of people on the safety of these vaccines. However, the court agreed to examine the issue as it saw an important question on personal autonomy to seek information vis-à-vis the right to public health. The matter will be heard after four weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-notice-to-centre-on-plea-seeking-disclosure-of-clinical-trial-data-of-covid-vaccines-101628492131812.html

Hundreds of villages are inundated with water, and Bundelkhand region is the worst-hit. Rivers in various parts of the state are flowing above the danger level.According to news agency ANI, more than 500 houses near the banks of rivers in Bundelkhand are submerged in water. As the water level continues to rise, many people are moving to safer areas on their own.

Meanwhile, in Badagaon village in Baghpat district, a 10-year-old girl died in a wall collapse incident on Sunday. Two others were also injured.In Jhansi as well, the water level in Betwa river rose due to incessant rainfall. "Water is being released from Matatila, Sukma Dukma and Parichha dams.

09-08-2021||India||Opposition will allow passage of 127th Constitution Amendment Bill||The Opposition on Monday decided that it will “cooperate” with the Narendra Modi government to clear a constitutional amendment that aims to restore the power of states to identify backward castes. The Bill will come for passage in the Lok Sabha today.At a meeting held at Rajya Sabha Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge’s office here, various parties spoke about the important Bill while trying to finalise their strategy for the remaining part of the session.While two parties were in favour of continuous protests, others were of the opinion that the Constitution amendment should be cleared as it empowers the states on a very sensitive subject.“We decided that we will allow and cooperate for the passage of the Constitution amendment bill. On all other issues, our protest will continue,” said CPIM’s Elamaram Kareem, one of the leaders present in the meeting.The 127th Constitution Amendment Bill 2021 aims to bypass a May 2021 Supreme Court ruling that said only the Centre could notify socially and educationally backward classes (SEBCs) — and not the states.Click here for LIVE Updates of Parliament proceedingsThe apex court’s decision triggered protests by state governments and other backward caste (OBC) groups. The Bill comes ahead of crucial elections in five states early next year.Opposition support to the Bill is significant as a constitutional amendment requires two-thirds majority of lawmakers who are present during the proceedings, with at least 50% in attendance.But some parties may chose to use opportunities in the debate to highlight the Pegasus issue, the recent rape of a dalit girl and the farm agitation, another Opposition leader said.So far, the monsoon session of Parliament, which began on July 19, has been rocked by frequent protests and disruptions. Both Houses have seen Opposition lawmakers troop to the Well, hold placards and shout slogans against the government over their demand to discuss the Pegasus row, the three farm laws and rising fuel prices. Last week, a Rajya Sabha MP -- TMC’s Santanu Sen -- was suspended for the session for alleged “unruly” behaviour, with Opposition leaders accusing the Chair of not allowing them to express their views.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-will-allow-passage-of-127th-constitution-amendment-bill-101628488874067.html

09-08-2021||India||Bihar to acquire documents in private collections linked to Quit India movement||Several documents related to the Quit India movement and the Colonial period in general, which were still held in unknown private collections in the state, will now be acquired by the Bihar State Archives department for preservation as an exclusive segment, officials said. The Quit India movement was a mass civil disobedience against the British rule, launched on 8 August 1942 by Mahatma Gandhi and the country is celebrating its 79th anniversary this year. Bihar was one of the major centres of the movement which saw seven students leading a protest rally in Patna getting killed in firing ordered by the then city magistrate WC Archer, while they were heading to hoist the tricolour atop the secretariat building.“There still exists a memorial for those who died in this incident on August 11, 1942. The State Archives also has the original pictures of all the seven students killed in the firing. But that rally must have been attended by many others who participated in the Quit India movement but have remained unknown,” Dr Rashmi Kiran, an official from the State Archives, said. The department aims to collect information about such unknown participants and document their contributions after acquiring the articles related to the movement, she added. “Their grandchildren or great grandchildren must be having diaries or letters or even footnotes related to their work. These might prove to be an important source of information about the Colonial rule in the country,” she said. The department will soon be inviting such people through media to approach the department with their collection related to the Quit India movement. “We are preparing to observe the 75th anniversary of the country’s Independence, the Aazadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, and this plan to create a segment of private collections is a part of this celebration. It’s also an effort to preserve the treasures of information and history of the state and the country,” she said.Former Patna University history teacher and also the former director of the Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Public Library, Professor Imtiaz Ahmed said it was a good initiative. “It will enrich the State Archives’ collection of documents. There are many families in the state capital whose grandparents or great grandparents participated in the freedom struggle, especially in the Quit India movement. Their collections of personal diaries or letters would definitely yield important information about the nature and composition of the freedom movement in the country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-to-acquire-documents-in-private-collections-linked-to-quit-india-movement-101628484374120.html
09-08-2021||India||PM Modi to discuss maritime security as Indian Navy set to enhance its sea-power||As Prime Minister Narendra Modi today chairs a UN Security Council debate on maritime security, India is all set to enhance its blue water Navy status by commissioning indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, strategic ballistic missile submarine INS Arighat and latest guided missile destroyer INS Visakhapatnam in its 75th year of independence.INS Visakhapatnam will be commissioned into Indian Navy by November this year, INS Arighat with a more efficient nuclear engine and potent long range missiles is all set to be commissioned into India’s strategic forces next year with INS Vikrant to be commissioned by August 15, 2022. As a force multiplier, the Indian Navy will be soon approaching the Defence Acquisition Council for clearance of six more diesel attack submarines under Project 75I.Apart from strengthening the Indian Navy, India is guided by PM Modi’s vision of Security and Growth for All in the Tegion (SAGAR) for cooperative and sustainable use of the oceans with a foundation built on safe, secure and stable maritime domain in the region. It is in this context that India is a very active player in Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Army Robbery against ships (ReCAAP) in Asia.The Indian Navy also keeps in sync with the foreign policy by participating in cooperative manoeuvres and exercise with major maritime powers and littoral states in the Indo-Pacific. From August 24, the Quad navies will be participating in Malabar exercises off the coast of Guam in far Pacific with focus on interoperability and capability to counter any unilateral domination of the Indo-Pacific. The Indian maritime approach is very internationalist and based on UNCLOS, which is the basis for freedom of navigation and open sea lanes of communication bereft of any artificial boundaries like the nine- dash line imposed by Beijing on South China Sea.Just as India's vision of maritime cooperation is anchored in SAGAR, it is strengthening its own maritime security by development of Andamans and Nicobar Islands and the Lakshwadeep Islands, which dominate the major shipping lanes and trade routes from the Gulf to countries beyond Malacca Straits. Besides, it is also building deep seaports like Vadhavan in Maharashtra and Paradeep Outer in Odisha apart from enhancing capacities and operational efficiency of 12 major ports at the cost of ₹58884 crores under the SAGARMALA scheme.With Russian President Vladimir Putin and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken expected to join the maritime security debate at the UNSC, a global perspective will be shaped today for better and environment friendly management of oceans with all the major powers contributing to the cooperative mechanism in Indo-Pacific and beyond.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-discuss-maritime-security-as-indian-navy-set-to-enhance-its-seapower-101628484139740.html

09-08-2021||India||Naveen Patnaik plans separate dept for western Odisha, BJP calls it 'gimmick'||More than two decades after the Odisha government created a separate development council for 10 western districts infamous for their backwardness and poverty, it is now planning to create a new department for western Odisha to effectively deal with the development issues in a holistic and time-bound way, people aware of the developments, said.They claim that a proposal may be brought before the state cabinet soon much before the process of gram panchayat polls gets underway early next year. The idea, if it finally makes it through the Cabinet, would make Odisha only the second state after Assam- which approved one for Bodoland in May this year-- with a separate department for a region. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had first created a separate department for the north east region in 2001 and then followed it up with a ministry in 2004, but no state had done it till Assam took the decision about two months ago.Some leaders from the ruling Biju Janata Dal requesting anonymity said that the proposal was at an advanced stage, but refused to give a timeline. “Chief minister Naveen Patnaik has kept western Odisha in focus. Over the last couple of years, he has pumped in huge amounts of money for irrigation schemes for several districts of western Odisha including Kalahandi, Sambalpur and Bargarh. The government is also announcing more money for building smart classrooms in government high schools there. More projects would be announced once the Covid pandemic weakens a bit,” said Sushant Singh, the minister for rural development, adding that a special assistance of ₹50 crores given for management of Covid-19 in 11 districts of western Odisha was proof of the government’s seriousness for the region.In 2000, the Naveen Patnaik government created the Western Odisha Development Council comprising 10 districts of Bargarh, Balangir, Boudh, Deogarh, Jharsuguda, Kalahandi, Nuapada, Sambalpur, Subarnapur, Sundargarh and Athamallick Sub-division of Angul district with an annual Budget of ₹100 crore for community based projects as per people’s needs. The region, known for labour migration to other states and wrecked by natural disasters like droughts, has been a huge drag on the state’s development with a poverty rate higher than state’s 32% . Districts like Kalahandi often made headlines for child trafficking.Officials in the know said a separate department would help in convergence of several government schemes as the development council had failed to deliver the desired results. At present, development work related to the region is taken up separately by different departments causing delays.Since inception, the WODC was sanctioned ₹1,615.93 crore for taking up different projects under road and communication, agricultural development, irrigation, water supply schemes, infrastructure development in school and colleges, health services, and electrification of villages. This year, the government increased its annual budget to ₹200 crore. But an audit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CA) last year found plenty of irregularities and infirmities in the council’s accounts and decision making. As per the audit report, 34 of the 89 blocks in the region were still “very backward”, while 25 were backward and adequate priority had not been given to bring them at par with developed blocks. The audit found that frequent changes in the projects by the MLAs led to low spending, which was also a result of lack of coordination between the executing agencies. The CAG was also critical of the Western Odisha Development Council’s (WODC) decision to provide financial assistance to certain private educational institutions in disregard of the statutory instructions.Political analysts said the government’s move to have a separate department for western Odisha may be rooted in the BJD’s grand plan to strike at the votebase of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in western Odisha. In 2017 panchayatiraj polls, BJP won 9 of the zilla parishads, most of them in western and tribal Odisha. In 2019 Lok Sabha polls, BJD lost out to the BJP in almost the entire western Odisha belt, which helped the ruling party at the Centre win 8 of the 21 Lok Sabha seats and secure 38.37 % of the votes, a rise of 16.49 % from its 2014 figures.“Since the last couple of years, BJD has been trying its best to cut into BJP’s votebase in Kalahandi, Sambalpur and Sundargarh. The only way the party can do this is through better implementation of basic welfare measures. Since the beginning, the WODC had its headquarter in Bhubaneswar and that affected the development process. Creation of a separate department is BJD’s way of telling western Odisha electorate that it cares for them,” said Satya Prakash Dash, a political science professor.BJP state vice-president and MLA of Kuchinda in Sambalpur district, Nauri Nayak said creation of a separate department is yet another “gimmick” by the state government to woo the people of western Odisha.“Since several years, WODC has functioned only with a chairman and a CEO, when it was supposed to have 22 members including 11 MLAs, 2 members of parliament and experts. In the past 20 years, the WODC has served as a political rehabilitation center for the ruling party politicians or retired bureaucrats. All these years, the government could not even shift the council’s headquarter in any western Odisha town, and now, they are talking of a separate department. We demand that the headquarters of the WODC be shifted to Sambalpur for better implementation of projects,” said Nayak..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naveen-patnaik-plans-separate-dept-for-western-odisha-bjp-calls-it-101628480053646.html

The states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have been engaged in a war of words over water sharing and some irrigation projects on the Krishna river, which prompted Centre to come out with the gazetted notification to GRMB and KRMB.The ministry of jal shakti, through a gazette notification on July 16, set the jurisdiction of GRMB and KRMB to reduce friction between the two states in the area of water management. It is aimed at awarding the boards more powers for administration, regulation, operation, and maintenance of projects listed therein in Godavari and Krishna rivers in the two states.The K Chandrashekar Rao-led Telangana government said on Sunday that it won't be able to take part in the emergency meeting due to some prior commitments. In a letter to the Godavari River Management Board, Telangana special chief secretary Rajat Kumar said the representatives of the state will not be able to attend the board meeting, owing to various legal matters posted on Monday. "It is requested to kindly indicate another convenient date so that members from Telangana state can attend the meeting and present their views," Kumar wrote to the board.The YS Jagan Mohan Reddy-led Andhra Pradesh government had filed a petition in the Supreme Court complaining that Telangana was refusing to follow decisions taken in the apex council constituted under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 directions of the Krishna River Management Board and those of the Centre. Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana responded that he would not adjudicate the legal issues involved in the matter, insisting that the states resolve the matter through talks, which the Supreme Court bench was willing to assist, an invitation which the Andhra government declined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/krishna-godavari-river-management-board-to-hold-emergency-meeting-today-101628478608564.html
09-08-2021||India||'Historic moment for India': Aircraft carrier Vikrant returns after sea trials||Indigenous Aircraft Carrier (IAC) Vikrant returned after five-day sea trial to test the performance of the 40,000-tonne warship. IAC Vikrant, built at a cost of around ₹23,000 crore, set sail from Kochi on August 4 for the crucial sea trials ahead of its planned induction into the Indian Navy by August next year.On the successful completion of the trial, Vice Admiral AK Chawla said it is indeed a "historic moment for the country"."We are going back to Kochi after five days of trials at sea. We're going back with a great sense of satisfaction. This has been possible with dedicated teamwork," Vice Admiral was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The navy said that the system parametres proved satisfactory during the trials. The ship's performance, including hull, main propulsion, Power Generation and Distribution (PGD) and auxiliary equipment were tested during the exercise.The trials were reviewed by Vice Admiral AK Chawla, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief Southern Naval Command.The aircraft carrier is 262 metres long, 62 metres at the widest part and a height of 59 metre including the superstructure. There are 14 decks in all, including five in the superstructure.The warship will operate MiG-29K fighter jets, Kamov-31 helicopters, MH-60R multi-role helicopters. It has a top speed of around 28 knots and a cruising speed of 18 knots with an endurance of about 7,500 nautical miles.The ship has over 2,300 compartments, designed for a crew of around 1,700 people, having gender-sensitive accommodation spaces for women officers. The ship with high degree of automation for machinery operation, ship navigation and survivability, has been designed to accommodate an assortment of fixed-wing and rotary aircraft.With the delivery of Vikrant, India would join a select group of nations with the capability to indigenously design and build an aircraft carrier. It will also provide thrust to Centre's 'Make in India' initiative. Delivery of IAC would also strengthen India's position in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and its quest for a blue water Navy.India currently has only one aircraft carrier - INS Vikramaditya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/historic-moment-for-india-aircraft-carrier-vikrant-returns-after-sea-trials-101628477884494.html

The Bill aims to clarify “some provisions in the 102nd Constitutional amendment Bill” to restore the power of the states to identify backward classes — a demand made by a number of regional parties and even the ruling party’s own OBC leaders.The new Bill nullifies the top court’s decision ruling that after a 2018 amendment in the Constitution, only the Centre could notify socially and educationally backward classes (SEBCs), not the states.Click here for LIVE Updates of Parliament proceedingsUnion minister of AYUSH Sarbananda Sonowal will be introducing the National Commission for Homoeopathy (Amendment) Bill, 2021 and the National Commission for Indian System of Medicine (Amendment) Bill, 2021 in the lower house.

The amendment Bill seeks to facilitate greater ease of living to law-abiding corporates and to decriminalise certain provisions of the Act.The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (Amendment) Bill, 2021 or the DICGC Amendment Bill 2021 proposes three key changes that could vastly improve the working of deposit insurance as it stands today. These changes, if passed into law, will add an extra dimension to the Centre’s landmark move last year to hike the insurance coverage for individual depositors in banks from ₹1 lakh to ₹5 lakh.Union minister Arjun Munda will be moving the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Bill, 2021 in the Lok Sabha. The Upper House on Thursday passed the Bill allowing the inclusion of Mishmi-Kaman (Miju Mishmi), Idu (Mishmi), Taraon (Digaru Mishmi) and Monpa, Memba, Sartang and Sajolang (Miji) in the list in lieu of Mishmi, Idu, Taroan, and Momba respectively.

09-08-2021||India||‘We don’t believe in attacking others’ power grids’: Union power minister Raj Kumar Singh||Raj Kumar Singh, the two-time Lok Sabha member of Parliament from Arrah, Bihar, was recently elevated as a Union cabinet minister for the ministries of power and new and renewable energy. In an interview, Singh talked about new electricity distribution reforms and India’s growing position as a global climate leader.The Centre also plans to extend the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme to electrolysers and an uniform electricity tariff is being examined for future green bids, he said. India will also take up the climate financing commitments made by developed nations at the Conference of the Parties (COP 26). Singh, a former home secretary and a 1975 batch Bihar cadre IAS officer, also termed cyberattacks on India’s power grid as an act of warfare. Edited excerpts:When will the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2021, be tabled in Parliament?It has gone to the cabinet secretariat, which has to put it up before the cabinet. It is something that is necessary and something on which nobody can have cogent objections because, what are we saying? We are saying let’s delicense it. Why do we still have licensing in distribution? By doing so, you will open up the doors to competition. You have to decide whether the people exist to serve the discoms (distribution companies) or vice-versa. The discoms exist to serve the people, and the people deserve a choice. If you provide good service and if your pricing is better, you compete on price and service. Whosoever gives better service to the people will survive. That’s how it is. That’s how it should be. Nobody can have a right to monopoly.India’s largest power generation utility NTPC Ltd is operating at a low plant load factor (PLF). Why is that so?PLF for the entire system is 55-60%. That means that about 40% is not being scheduled, because we have installed capacity of 382 gigawatts (GW) against a maximum demand of 200GW. Basically, PLF of thermal power plants will remain around this level and may come down a bit because we are in the midst of an energy transition. It is a conscious transition and that has to be done in a sustainable manner. The transition is necessary for the environment and our government has a commitment to (protecting the) environment. We will be the first ones (in the world) to come out with large grid-scale green hydrogen manufacturing.Will the PLI scheme be extended to electrolysers used for producing green hydrogen?It is coming. That is my next proposal to the cabinet. It is getting drafted. We are bringing a scheme for electrolysers.Will India raise the threats posed by Chinese hackers targeting our critical infrastructure, such as the power grid, on the global stage?We are strengthening our cybersecurity mechanism. We are carrying out exercises to check the measures we have instituted to tackle cyberattacks and we are strengthening those measures. No country will accept that they are behind the cyberattacks. The attacks also followed a system of mirroring, or bouncing it of servers of other countries. But by and large we know from where it did happen and from where it is happening. We have a fair idea.Are you also doing something?I am not saying that. We don’t believe in attacking other people’s power systems. I am only saying this: that by and large people should desist from doing this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-don-t-believe-in-attacking-others-power-grids-union-power-minister-raj-kumar-singh-101628464655696.html
09-08-2021||India||Assam CM may call on PM and Shah over Mizoram border row||Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma is likely to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah in New Delhi on Monday to discuss the border dispute with Mizoram, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP said on Sunday even as an Assam minister warned of moving the Supreme Court against the neighbouring state.Six Assam Police personnel and a civilian were killed and dozens were injured as a decades-long border dispute sparked violent clashes on July 26, prompting Himanta and his Mizoram counterpart Zoramthanga to publicly trade charges. The two sides reached an interim agreement to withdraw their forces from the disputed 4km stretch on July 28.“The Assam CM is likely to meet the PM on Monday. After that, the CM accompanied by all the MPs from Assam, will meet home minister Amit Shah. There is a possibility that they might discuss a permanent solution to the border dispute,” said BJP MP from Silchar, Rajdeep Roy.The border clash proved to be a flashpoint between the two BJP-ruled states with the Mizoram Police registering an FIR against Himanta and six top state officials on charges of attempt to murder and assault, and the Assam Police summoning Mizoram’s Rajya Sabha member K Vanlalvena and six top officials over their alleged role in fanning tensions. The political standoff appeared to abate on August 2 as the two sides withdrew the police cases after key leaders met PM Modi.However, the ties between the two states might not be completely on the mend as Assam minister Parimal Suklabaidya said he would consider moving the top court against the Mizoram government if it did not take action against its police officials who he said opened fire at the border, claiming seven lives.“People are angry and as their representatives, we cannot ignore their emotions. If Mizoram does not take action against its police officials for killing six Assam police jawans, we will consider moving the Supreme Court for justice,” said the MLA from Dholai constituency, where Lailapur — one of the sites of the clashes— is located.The Mizoram government has maintained that its police personnel acted in self-defence. “Assam police initially attempted to claim Mizoram’s land and they are the ones who started firing on the police officials of Mizoram. Our police fired in defence...,” said chief secretary Lalnunmawia Chuaungo.Meanwhile, the movement of trucks carrying essential goods to Mizoram appeared to improve after Assam eased an undeclared blockade. “In less than 24 hours of the economic blockade being lifted, more than 200 vehicle have safely moved towards Aizwal. These vehicles, carrying essential items were stranded for more than 10 days. We assure each and every driver that they’ll be safe inside Mizoram if they come, “ executive magistrate-level official of Mizoram’s Kolasib district Carolyne Pachuau said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-cm-may-call-on-pm-and-shah-over-mizoram-border-row-101628458302433.html
09-08-2021||India||Arrest of tribal farmers sparks outrage in Telangana||The Telangana forest department’s recent complaint against 23 farmers in the Yellannasagar village of Konijeria Mandal in Khammam of an attack against their officers during a farmland recovery, which led to their eventual arrest on Friday under charges of attempt to murder, drew sharp criticism from the tribal leaders and opposition parties in the state for the past three days. According to the complaint, on August 3, the tribals attacked the forest department staff when they forcefully tried to recover farmland that the villagers have been cultivating for decades. Acting on the complaint, the police registered a case under sections 307, 353 and 158 r/w 149 of the IPC against the tribal farmers and sent them to 14 days judicial remand. Among the arrested women are Alapati Kavitha, mother to a three-month-old baby; Kavya, who has an eight-month-old baby and Rani, whose child is one year old. The mothers were seen carrying their infants to jail. “My wife Swapna and I own three acres of land, which was passed on by my grandfather. On that day, about 20 forest officials came and suddenly started destroying our crop. When we stopped them, they used foul language and attacked us. But we stood there protecting our land. They threatened us with dire consequences and said that they will drive us out of this town and filed cases against us,“ claimed Narasimha, a tribal farmer.Khammam commissioner Vishnu S Warrier confirmed to HT, “Yes, the villagers did attack forest officials with sticks and stones. But on Saturday, all the accused moved a bail petition. After speaking to eyewitnesses, we have decided to alter the sections, and in all likelihood, they will get bail.”The arrests drew flak from the CPI (ML-New Democracy) State committee.“Three women farmers with their babies in their laps were among those arrested and sent to jail. How can women with children attack with stones? The forest staff are adopting a vindictive attitude towards the farmers without heeding their requests to desist from destroying their crops. The state government should withdraw the false cases foisted against the farmers and take stern action against those responsible for resorting to repressive measures against women farmers,” said CPI (ML-ND) State assistant secretary Potu Ranga Rao.Congress Mulugu MLA Seethakka added, “The Congress had assigned the Dalits and Adivasis these podu (agricultural) lands which the KCR govt is forcefully vanquishing. No jobs have been given to these Dalits too. I will put an end to the atrocities of CM KCR’s politics soon.” Forest staff, speaking on the condition of anonymity, refuted the charges made by politicians. “A section of the villagers of Yellanna Nagar assaulted the forest staff when the latter tried to take up preparatory works for plantation drive as part of Haritha Haram afforestation programme in the forest land under Gubbagurthi reserve forest area.Historically, tribal communities have depended on forests for their livelihoods. Many tribals engage in a form of shifting cultivation in upland forests, called podu which is a bone of contention with forest officials. The Telangana government had launched an ambitious afforestation program named Harita Haram, which has become a major reason for the eviction of tribals. The state government in 2015 had decided not to entertain any further claims under the Forest Rights Act which had emboldened the forest department staff to suppress the rights of Adivasis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arrest-of-tribal-farmers-sparks-outrage-in-telangana-101628452751240.html
09-08-2021||India||TN parties begin work to face local body polls||Parties have started preparing for the upcoming local body polls, slated to be held before the end of this year. The polls will be the first since the assembly elections held on April 6. With an eye on the upcoming polls, the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) is focusing on the districts in the western region where it fared poorly. Chief minister and DMK president MK Stalin even went on a huddle with district secretaries on Sunday to discuss the polls. The Supreme Court has ordered the Tamil Nadu state election body to complete the rural local body polls in nine newly created districts before September 15. Elections to urban local bodies were last held in October 2011 and after their five year tenure was over issues over delimitation of wards arose and stalled the elections.However, elections to 27 rural local bodies were completed in 2011. “Their tenure will continue,” said a senior DMK leader who was part of the meeting. “Today’s meeting focused on the nine districts and since it will be the first election since our win, the chief minister wants us to build on the goodwill gained so far,” the DMK leader said. MLAs and MPs belonging to the nine new districts--Vellore, Ranipet, Tirupattur, Kancheepuram, Chengalpet, Villupuram, Kallakuruchi, Tirunelvelu, Tenkasi-- were also present at the meeting. While these regions are predominantly in the south, considered as DMK’s stronghold and north where the party performed well, DMK is now working to weaken the opposition AIADMK’s hometurf in the western region. The alliance led by DMK won just 17 of the 50 seats in the region, while it almost swept all other regions in the state. The AIADMK-led alliance with the BJP won the remaining 33. The western belt, also known as the Kongu region, is also the only place where the BJP enjoys considerable support in comparison to its unpopularity elsewhere in the state and the national party hopes to grow from here. Two of BJP’s four MLAs are from this region. The BJP has formed a 17-member panel to start preparing for the local body polls. “We will study our strengths in the panchayats, municipalities and corporations to analyse where we can contest,” said Karu Nagarajan, BJP’s state general secretary and a committee member. “As a first step we will collect nominations and then we will plan our strategy, campaign before sitting down with our alliance partners.”The DMK inducted three MLAs from the western belt into its cabinet and also saw to it that it has representation from the largely present Gounder community from here from which former chief minister Edappadi Palanswami belongs. The DMK has been poaching strong leaders from the western region belonging to the AIADMK and Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM). Stalin while inductingHaasan’s lieutenant turned rebel R Mahendran in July had said that the party would have fared better in the west if people like Mahendran were with the DMK. “Even while campaigning last year, we were focussed on building our strength in the western region. We need to do more there,” the DMK leader said. The party is hoping that its popularity after forming the government will help them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-parties-begin-work-to-face-local-body-polls-101628452631925.html
09-08-2021||India||Tripura police arrest 14 TMC leaders for violating Covid-19 norms, they get bail later||Hours after arresting as many as 14 Trinamool Congress leaders for violating Covid-19 norms, a local court released them on bail on Sunday, according to people aware of the development. Those arrested included Sudip Raha and Jaya Datta who were injured after their vehicle was attacked allegedly by BJP activists at Ambassa in Dhalai district on Saturday. A senior TMC leader said that they were returning to Agartala after the incident when police stopped them in Khowai district saying that there could be more attacks on them by miscreants. According to the police, the TMC leaders violated the Covid-19 night curfew norms by travelling after 7 pm since the entire state is under curfew for ten hours from 7 pm. After landing in Agartala on Sunday, TMC general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, West Bengal Education Minister Bratya Basu and Rajya Sabha MP Dola Sen went to Khowai to meet the arrested leaders. The three senior TMC leaders sought to meet the police personnel to show them the copy of a case lodged against the 14 TMC leaders and also inquire why the BJP miscreants were not arrested for violating Covid-19 norms. Banerjee, earlier on August 2, visited the state for the first time in the aftermath of 23 members of the Indian-Political Action Committee ( I-PAC) led by political strategist Prashant Kishore being booked and asked to stay inside a hotel in Agartala for violating Covid-19 norms. The team was in Agartala last month to assess the scope of expanding the base of Trinamool Congress in the BJP-ruled state. The party, that had had fielded 24 candidates, failed to get a single seat in the assembly polls in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-police-arrest-14-tmc-leaders-for-violating-covid-19-norms-they-get-bail-later-101628452391788.html
09-08-2021||India||Day after portfolio allocations, troubles begin for Bommai||Bengaluru A day after chief minister Basavaraj Bommai distributed portfolios to his Cabinet members, at least two ministers- N Nagaraj (MTB) and Anand Singh- met chief minister on Sunday demanding that they either be given better portfolios or allow them to drop out of the Cabinet.“I am a little saddened by the portfolio distribution,” Nagaraj said after meeting with the chief minister. Nagaraj has been alloted the municipal administration, small scale and public sector industries portfolio, while Singh, on the other hand, has been given tourism, ecology and environment portfolios.He said that even during the tenure of BS Yediyurappa, there was discontentment over the portfolio allocation but was under the impression that it would be fixed under Bommai’s leadership. Both Singh and Nagaraj have said that they will “make a decision” if their grievances are not heard; though it remains unclear what they mean by this.Nagaraj said that he was a housing minister in the HD Kumaraswamy-led coalition government and was hoping to get the same portfolio or a better one when he defected.“I have spoken about all issues with him (Anand Singh). He has shared his concerns. I have told him that I understand how you feel and will do everything to uphold your honour,” Bommai said.Even as it is considered normal for some discontent to brew over portfolio allocations, the widening rift within the Karnataka BJP over ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders’ have started to rear its head in a state that heads to polls in less than two years.It all started with Bommai, who had been 13 years with the BJP before he was chosen for the top post over other seniors of the party. Now the issue appears to have trickled down to his Cabinet.Satish Reddy, the BJP legislator from Bommanahalli in Bengaluru said that workers were openly stating that “outsiders” were given all the opportunities within a party where its core-party MLAs were being left out.Barring R Shankar and Shrimant Patil, all the defectors who were part of the earlier Cabinet have been retained, indicating that Yediyurappa is calling the shots to ensure those who helped him to power continue to be rewarded.Analysts and other legislators said that putting the interests of a few individuals over that of the party could set a dangerous precedent as dissent among those who consider themselves core-BJP.Even Bommai’s meeting with Janata Dal (Secular) supremo and former prime minister HD Deve Gowda after taking oath as chief minister sent a few legislators like Pritam Gowda over the edge. He said that there was no requirement for such meetings and it sends a wrong message ahead of the Zilla and taluka panchayat elections, scheduled to be held later this year.There are at least 14 districts, including Mysuru, Hassan, Kalaburagi and Vijayapura that have no representation at all. Bengaluru, which has 28 assembly constituencies, accounts for seven ministers. Reddy said that with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) elections round the corner, the government needed to give more importance and accommodate ministers from India’s IT capital.However, it may well be beyond Bommai to placate disgruntled elements as Yediyurappa appears to be in charge despite the change in leadership. The majority who made it to the Cabinet are either those who are loyal to Yediyurappa or who helped him to power in 2019, Hindustan Times reported on Wednesday.“It does not matter who gets what portfolio as long as they are willing to work,” said one newly inducted minister, requesting not to be named. He, however, added that there would be some rumblings but much of this would settle down within a few days. There are just four vacancies in the Cabinet and Bommai has more than thrice the number of aspirants. Including Ramesh Jarkiholi, the former minister whose home in Belagavi has become a rendezvous of sorts for legislators who have missed out on Cabinet berths.The disgruntlement also rears its head when nearly half of Karnataka’s 31 districts are dealing with floods and the state is staring at another wave of Covid-19 infections, leaving the population to fend for themselves.“Nothing is ok there (in the BJP government). Many are upset with making Bommai as the chief minister and now with the portfolio allocation,” Siddaramaiah, the leader of the opposition said on Sunday.He added that if the same continues, then all this dissent could implode within the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-portfolio-allocations-troubles-begin-for-bommai-101628452032912.html

09-08-2021||India||Day after his 73rd birthday, Sibal set to host Opposition leaders on Monday||Several Opposition leaders are set to gather at Congress leader Kapil Sibal’s house on Monday, a day after his 73rd birthday, with people aware of the developments saying that the gathering would serve as a platform for like-minded leaders to discuss uniting against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Nationalist Congress Party leaders Sharad Pawar and Praful Patel, Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’Brien, the National Conference’s Omar Abdullah, Samajwadi Pary chief Akhilesh Yadav, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s (DMK’s) Tiruchi Siva, and the Rashtriya Janata Dal’s Lalu Prasad are likely to make an appearance, a person aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity.Among those likely to be present at the gathering are also several of the so-called “G-23” leaders, who wrote a letter to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi last year, asking for an overhaul in the party’s, including elections to all party posts.“It’s just a personal dinner for my friends… There’s nothing more to it,” Sibal said when contacted by HT.Congress leader and MP Shashi Tharoor, who has also been invited to the gathering, said: “As far as I understand, Kapil’s dinner is just a discussion among like-minded people from various parties about the best ways forward to defeat the BJP in 2024. It is in no way any sort of rebel movement in the party; instead, it seeks to strengthen the entire Opposition, including the Congress.”A person who was among the signatories of the letter, however, said: “It’s been a year and there are many who feel that things have not moved.” “So we decided that we should take things beyond the Congress and also re-group,” the leader said, asking not to be named.When contacted, a Congress spokesperson declined a formal comment. The spokesperson, however, said that the Congress viewed it as Sibal’s personal engagement which in no way impacted the political party. Many Congress leaders who are not signatories are also likely to attend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-his-73rd-birthday-sibal-set-to-host-opposition-leaders-on-monday-101628451311771.html
09-08-2021||India||5 arrested for posting derogatory content against judges: CBI||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said on Saturday it has arrested five people in the last one month for allegedly posting derogatory content on social media against judges and the judiciary, a remark that came two days after a bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana lamented that CBI and other agencies “are not helping the judiciary at all”.To be sure, the arrests have been made in an unrelated case, in which probe was launched by CBI in November last year on the orders of the Andhra Pradesh high court. Of the five people, two were arrested on Saturday for allegedly posting defamatory content against Andhra Pradesh high court and Supreme Court judges, an officer said on condition of anonymity.The central agency took over 12 First Information Reports (FIRs), registered by the state Crime Investigation Division between April and July 2020 on the complaint of Registrar General of Andhra Pradesh high court, and clubbed all these into a single case.In its FIR registered on November 11, the agency named 16 people as accused and charged them under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including section 506 (criminal intimidation), and Section 67 of the IT Act.“It was alleged that the accused, by intentionally targeting the judiciary, made derogatory posts on social media platforms against judges and judiciary, following some court verdicts delivered by the judges of the high court of Andhra Pradesh,” said CBI spokesperson RC Joshi.The five people arrested have been identified as Pattapu Aadarsh and Lavanuru Samba Siva Reddy from Andhra Pradesh (arrested on Saturday); Dhami Reddy Konda Reddy and Pamula Sudheer (arrested on July 28) and Lingareddy Rajasekhar Reddy (arrested on July 9 on his arrival from Kuwait).“We were monitoring Lingareddy’s movements. The moment he landed in India, the officers took him into their custody,” the officer cited above said.According to the officer, the agency has also examined a Lok Sabha member N Suresh, and former MLA Amanchi Krishnamohan – both belonging to the YSR Congress – in connection with the case.Of the 16 booked in connection with the case, 13 have been traced while the other three are settled abroad and efforts are on to nab them, said a second officer, asking not to be named.“We have so far examined 11 out of the above 13 accused persons and arrested five. Evidence against the remaining six accused persons is being evaluated for further necessary legal action. CBI is pursuing to secure the presence of two other accused said to be abroad for their examination,” Joshi said.The agency carried out searches on the premises of the accused that led to the information that one of them was allegedly using a passport in a different name, he said. “Action was also initiated by CBI, after it had registered this case to get objectionable posts removed from the social media platforms, public domains and a lot of such posts or accounts were removed from the internet,” he added.Joshi said CBI has also sought cooperation from the channels of MLAT (mutual legal assistance treaties) and the Interpol to collect evidence from abroad.On August 6, while hearing the case of a Jharkhand district judge’s murder, Justice Ramana passed stern remarks on the working of the CBI and other investigative agencies with regards to complaints raised by judges.“In one or two places, the court ordered a CBI inquiry. I am very sorry to say that the CBI has done nothing in more than one year. At one place, I know, the CBI has done nothing. I think we have expected some changes in CBI’s attitude. But there is no change in the attitude of the CBI...They think it is not a priority item for them. The IB, CBI they are not helping the judiciary at all...,” the CJI had said while hearing a suo motu case on the issue of safeguarding courts and protecting judges in the wake of a recent incident of the alleged mowing down of a judge in Dhanbad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-arrested-for-posting-derogatory-content-against-judges-cbi-101628450111730.html

Hence under the leadership of Mamta Banerjee, all regional parties of India have to come together,” he added.Gogoi said the Raijor Dal has started talks with the Congress to discuss the upcoming bypolls in Assam and the prospect of opposition parties, except All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) joining hands.“We’ve had initial discussions with Congress. Some of their leaders are saying that they want to part ways with AIUDF, which was part of the ‘grand alliance’ for the assembly polls,” he added.Bypolls in at least five seats are to be held in the coming weeks after two newly elected MLAs died due to Covid-19, two Congress MLAs quit the party and joined the BJP and former CM and Majuli MLA Sarbananda Sonowal joined the Union cabinet last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/approached-by-tmc-to-merge-partygogoi-101628449513790.html
09-08-2021||India||53 assistant commandants pass out from ITBP Academy in Mussoorie||Fifty-three assistant commandants passed out from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police Academy in Mussoorie on Sunday. These 53 assistant commandants included 42 in General Duty category and 11 in Engineering category. Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami participated in the passing out parade and took the salute. SS Deswal, DG ITBP along with senior officers of the Force welcomed Dhami on the occasion. Lauding the role of ITBP in protecting the country’s border areas in the over 3400 km long Himalayan range, Dhami said it is because of their sacrifices and alertness in the difficult terrain that people can sleep peacefully at night. Dhami said he too was the son of an army man and as such was proud to participate in the passing out day parade. “ITBP personnel are not only protecting the Himalayan frontiers, they are also promoting adventure sports and initiating various welfare schemes in the border areas,” he said. The chief minister also expressed his gratitude to ITBP for its services during various disasters in the state and across the country. He recalled their services during the 2013 Kedarnath tragedy and overall contribution in taking care of many medical emergencies in high altitude areas during the Char Dham yatra and Mansarovar Yatra and so on. The chief minster while congratulating the new assistant commandants of ITBP, said he hoped that they would work with dedication and emerge as efficient and able leaders ITBP Academy, which was established in 1978, trains directly recruited officers of the rank of Assistant Commandants, who constitute senior leadership of the Force and directly recruited Sub-Inspectors, who constitute subordinate leadership level, according to the website of the Academy. Besides imparting initial training to these Officers, the Academy has also developed specialisation in disciplines like counter-insurgency operations, rock climbing, VIP protection, and identification and handling of improvised explosive devices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/53-assistant-commandants-pass-out-from-itbp-academy-in-mussoorie-101628449512699.html
09-08-2021||India||Highest threat to bodily integrity is in police custody: CJI||Underlining the importance of human rights and bodily integrity, Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana on Sunday lamented that police stations pose the “highest threat” to citizens’ rights.“The threat to human rights and bodily integrity is the highest in police stations...Going by recent reports, even the privileged are not spared third-degree treatment,” said the CJI as he spoke at the release of National Legal Services Authority’s legal services app and vision statement in New Delhi.Despite constitutional declarations and guarantees, Justice Ramana rued, lack of effective legal representation at the police stations is a huge detriment to arrested people.“To keep police excesses in check, dissemination of information about the constitutional right to legal aid and availability of free legal aid services is necessary,” said the CJI while imploring the NALSA to actively carry out nationwide sensitisation of police officers.Justice Ramana further emphasised that access to justice is an unending mission which will succeed only if judiciary can obviate obstacles like lengthy, painstaking, and expensive formal justice processes.“If, as an institution, the judiciary wants to garner the faith of the citizens, we have to make everyone feel assured that we exist for them. For the longest time, the vulnerable population has lived outside the system of justice,” he asserted.According to the CJI, it is imperative to bridge the gap of accessibility to justice between the highly privileged and the most vulnerable. He said the digital divide has not helped the cause of easy access to justice. Rural and remote areas suffer from lack of connectivity.“Accessing justice in India is not merely an aspirational goal. We need to work hand in hand with various wings of the government to make it a practical reality,” said justice Ramana, adding that he has already written to the government about the urgent need to bridge the digital chasm on a priority basis.Justice Uday U Lalit, who is the executive chairman of NALSA, said that law colleges must adopt the nearby talukas for spreading awareness about legal aid.“We are impressing upon bar councils and law colleges, and they must adopt one or two talukas around them, so that students can be given practical training to be part of a large contingent of para-volunteers. They will impress on people about their rights of legal aid,” Justice Lalit said at the same event.To further the accessibility of legal aid, Justice Lalit opined that it is essential that the services of post offices must be utilised owing to their well-established networks.“If we are to reach the remotest areas of the country, it must be through post offices. Post offices will spread awareness about legal services”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/highest-threat-to-bodily-integrity-is-in-police-custody-cji-101628449212405.html
09-08-2021||India||Tamil Nadu survey shows Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy highest among elderly||A state government survey on Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy has found that the elderly population in Tamil Nadu was the most hesitant compared to other age groups.The survey was carried out by the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine (DPH) in July to analyse people’s perception towards taking the vaccine across Tamil Nadu. 95 clusters were chosen randomly in the state with each cluster consisting of 30 random houses. Vaccine hesitancy was highest among those who were above the age of 60 with 27.6%, while for those in the 18-45 age category it was 16.9% and in the 45-60 age category it was 18.2%. The number of people who were surveyed in each of these three categories are 488, 1596, and 771 respectively. The survey covered a cross section of people who are professionals and illiterate and working, unemployed, students and those who are retired. Nearly 2855 people were surveyed. “This number is enough to conduct a rapid assessment to understand the problem for decision making,” said Dr K Kolandaswamy, former director of DPH. “The survey has shown what we have come to know anecdotally that there is vaccine hesitancy among the elderly, pregnancy and lactating women.” Pregnant and lactating women were also included in the survey.Among those who were not vaccinated, 80.3% of males and 81.6% of females were ready to get vaccinated, according to the survey released on Sunday. Vaccine hesitancy was observed in 19.7% men and 18.4% of women. Vaccine hesitancy was higher among rural respondents (20.3%) compared to urban areas (17.5%). According to the survey, reasons for vaccine hesitancy were manifold among the respondents who were both vaccinated and had not taken it. The top reasons were fear of injections, fear of complications, confidence that they will not get Covid-19 and being turned away due to short supply of vaccines and not being aware of where to get vaccines.Based on the survey results, the public health department has decided to focus on awareness activities to address misconceptions regarding the Covid-19 vaccine with special attention for people above 60 years of age. Strategies and facilities would be created to counter the barriers. “The survey has shown us that we need to create a supply that is closer to their homes,” said Dr T S Selvavinayagam, director public health who led the survey. “Most of these problems are easily addressable but the real challenge for us is the supply now.” The state has been perennially facing a shortage in vaccine supply from the Union government, but it has been addressed now. He added that another survey will be taken only if their performance in addressing hesitancy doesn’t work.The survey teams at each district were constituted and led by the respective Deputy Director of Health Services, while in Chennai; the survey was done by Community Medicine Postgraduate students from the Madras Medical College with support from Greater Chennai Corporation.“They visited houses and one family member was chosen by a random method from each house. They were interviewed to understand their perception towards Covid-19 vaccine, after verifying their vaccination status,” said a statement from the DPH.If the participant was vaccinated, the reason for their acceptance of the vaccine and getting vaccinated was recorded. If the participant was unvaccinated, the reasons for not getting vaccinated and their willingness to get vaccinated in future were also recorded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-survey-shows-covid-19-vaccine-hesitancy-highest-among-elderly-101628448431533.html
09-08-2021||India||Mixing shots safe and effective: Study||After analysing the accidental mixing of Covishield and Covaxin vaccine shots in 18 people in an Uttar Pradesh village, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has concluded in a pre-print study that the combination of the two Covid-19 vaccines elicits a better immune response than two jabs of the same vaccine.In May, 20 villagers in a government-run hospital in UP’s Siddharthnagar district were inadvertently administered the second dose of Covaxin after the first dose of Covishield after a gap of six weeks. Of the 20, 18 agreed to be part of the study. Among them, 11 were men with a median age of 62 years. A comorbid condition (hypertension) was reported in one individual.“We compared the safety and immunogenicity profile of them against that of individuals receiving either Covishield or Covaxin… Immunogenicity profile against Alpha, Beta and Delta variants in the heterologous group was superior; IgG antibody and neutralising antibody response of the participants was also significantly higher compared to that in the homologous groups,” researchers said in the paper, which is yet to be peer-reviewed.While the findings could benefit the immunisation programme, there is a need for a randomised controlled trial to further corroborate the findings.“A slew of studies suggests that mixing vaccines provokes potent immune responses, but scientists still want answers on real-world efficacy and rare side effects,” according to Nature.According to the study, none of the participants enrolled in the study had any serious adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) within 30 minutes of inoculation with the first or second dose. The most common local after-effect reported after the first and second doses was pain at the injection site.“The findings suggest that immunisation with a combination of an adenovirus vector platform-based vaccine (Covishield) followed by an inactivated whole virus vaccine (Covaxin) was not only safe but also elicited better immunogenicity,” the paper said.The national immunisation programme against Covid-19 began on January 16 with two vaccines: AstraZeneca’s ChAdOx1-nCov-19 (termed Covishield in India) and inactivated whole virion BBV152 (Covaxin). The regimen for both vaccines initially had a priming dose followed by a homologous booster dose at an interval of four weeks. The gap between the two Covishield doses was later increased to 6-8 weeks, and then to 8-12 weeks. There was no change in the Covaxin schedule.India prioritised frontline workers, including health care professionals, people above the age of 60 years and adults with comorbidities for vaccination before opening it up for all adults.“The nationwide vaccination program at this time entered into 4 months of its existence and the event of mixed dosing raised considerable anxiety in public domain with a potential to contributing to vaccine hesitancy. We conducted the current investigation against this backdrop,” said the paper published in the open access medical journal, MedRxiv.In July, the subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation granted approval to Christian Medical College, Vellore, to conduct clinical trials of mixing of both Covishield and Covaxin vaccines.“For this particular study, these people were closely monitored, and their parameters checked at regular intervals to find out the effect of mixing of both the Covid-19 vaccines. There are other studies going on globally and nationally as well to determine the effect of mixing two different types of vaccines as part of the inoculation regimen and we have had promising results so far. However, this is the first result to study the effects of mixing adeno vector and inactivated whole virion based Covid-19 vaccines,” said one of the authors of the ICMR study, asking not to be named.“These findings have an important implication for the Covid-19 vaccination program wherein heterologous immunisation will pave the way for induction of improved and better protection against the variant strains of Sars-CoV-2. Such mixed regimens will also help to overcome the challenges of shortfall of particular vaccines and remove hesitancy around vaccines in people’s mind that could have genesis in programmatic “errors” especially in settings where multiple Covid-19 vaccines are being used,” said the paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mixing-shots-safe-and-effective-study-101628448312631.html
09-08-2021||India||Govt to push legislation in final week of session||With just five days left until the end of Parliament’s monsoon session, the central government is looking to push through a constitutional amendment that aims to restore the power of states to identify backward castes, at a time the Opposition has indicated that it will stick to its strategy of demanding a debate on the Pegasus spyware controversy and the contentious agriculture laws.So far, the monsoon session of Parliament, which began on July 19, has been rocked by frequent protests and disruptions. Both Houses have seen Opposition lawmakers troop to the Well, hold placards and shout slogans against the government over their demand to discuss the Pegasus row, the three farm laws and rising fuel prices. Last week, a Rajya Sabha MP -- TMC’s Santanu Sen -- was suspended for the session for alleged “unruly” behaviour, with Opposition leaders accusing the Chair of not allowing them to express their views.According to Opposition leaders, the government has not yet reached out to the parties to seek support for The 127th Constitution Amendment Bill 2021, which aims to bypass a May 2021 Supreme Court ruling that said only the Centre could notify socially and educationally backward classes (SEBCs) — and not the states.The new bill effectively bypasses the apex court’s decision, which triggered protests by state governments and other backward caste (OBC) groups. It also comes ahead of crucial elections in five states early next year.Opposition support to pass the bill is significant as a constitutional amendment requires two-thirds majority of lawmakers who are present during the proceedings, with at least 50% in attendance.A senior Congress strategist aware of the matter indicated on Sunday that the party will not budge from the demand for a debate on Pegasus.Congress chief whip in the Rajya Sabha, Jairam Ramesh, also hinted that the party is unlikely to shift its stand on Pegasus in the last five days of the session. “Remember what happened in 2010,” he said, pointing out how the 2010 winter session was a washout as the BJP, then in Opposition, vigorously demanded a joint parliamentary probe into allegations of corruption in the 2G spectrum allocation.The Trinamool Congress’s Lok Sabha leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay said the party, too, will continue to raise issues and demonstrate. “We will stage dharna at the Gandhi statue (in Parliament) on the violence against our party workers and leaders in Tripura. Inside Parliament, the Pegasus remains our key theme,” he said, referring to the alleged attack on TMC workers in Tripura by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders. The BJP has denied any involvement in Saturday’s incident in the north-eastern state.Other parties, however, said that the constitutional amendment is an important issue. “This is an important bill and I personally want it to be cleared,” said Elamaram Kareem, Rajya Sabha MP of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).In the three weeks of the monsoon session, opposition parties have largely presented a united front against the BJP-led government in Parliament. On Friday, leaders of 13 opposition parties attended the farmers’ protest at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar against the new farm laws, and spoke about the Pegasus controversy, which erupted last month after reports said that the Israeli spyware may have been used to hack the phones of activists, journalists and politicians in India.Party leaders also huddled together to arrive at a common strategy to counter the government over the two issues, and last week, MPs repeatedly brought up the Pegasus issue even as a debate on a bill introduced in House went on.On Monday, too, around 14 Opposition leaders from over a dozen parties will meet at 10am at the chamber of Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, to chalk out a common strategy.A senior non-Congress Opposition leader said they will likely continue to speak about Pegasus and farm laws at every opportunity.“We are going to give notices for amendments, discussion on bills. And every speaker, when his or her chance comes, might say a few sentences about national security, Pegasus... the issues that we want to highlight,” the leader said on condition of anonymity.Although much of the session has been rocked by demonstrations and a flurry of adjournments, the government has been able to pass key laws amid the din in both Houses of Parliament. It has managed to pass key bills such as The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Amendment Bill, 2021, The Essential Defence Services Bill, 2021 and The Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (Amendment) Bill, 2021 in both Houses.For this week, the government has added more bills in its legislative agenda. It wants to clear bills to create the National Commission for Homeopathy and National Commission for Indian System of Medicines. In the Lok Sabha, it has also listed The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (Amendment) Bill, 2021 (which will provide relief to depositers of stressed banks) and The Limited Liability Partnership (Amendment) Bill, 2021 (which aims to improve ease of business in India).“When the voice of the entire Opposition is being censored daily in Parliament, we will innovate to communicate. We all agreed on a unique technique last week, we will continue to hold them accountable next week,” said Derek O’Brien, TMC MP in Rajya Sabha said on Sunday.“Mr (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi, come listen to us,” the Trinamool leader wrote in a tweet on Sunday, posting a three-minute video of Opposition leaders protesting in both the Houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-push-legislation-in-final-week-of-session-101628448251017.html
09-08-2021||India||Flood-hit Raj, MP announce aid; rain continues in north||As heavy to moderate rainfall continued to lash parts of north India on Sunday, the flood situation in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan improved as the governments announced relief packages for the victims and commenced an evaluation of loss of life, livestock and property.Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who earlier announced a ₹4 lakh compensation to kin of those killed in rain-related incidents, announced on Sunday a fresh relief package of ₹30,000 for cow, ₹25,000 for the non-milking animal, ₹3000 for goat and sheep, and ₹60 for hen.Nearly 15,000 people, rescued from flood-hit districts of Shivpuri, Guna, Gwalior, Morena, Bhind, Sheopur, Datia and Ashok Nagar, are staying in over 230 relief camps.Early on Sunday, Union aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia undertook an aerial survey of flood-hit areas of the Gwalior-Chambal region. He also met the victims and assured to provide them all the necessary help.“I have never seen such devastation in the past 40 years. About 20000 lives have been saved so far with the help of the Air force, Army, NDRF and SDRF. Instructions have been given to provide relief after assessing the damage caused to the people at the earliest,” he said.In Rajasthan, chief minister Ashok Gehlot has directed officials to provide immediate financial assistance of ₹5 lakh to the next of kin of the deceased, and ₹2 lakh to the injured from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund.In this hour of crisis, all possible help will be provided to the families who have lost their loved ones. Orders have been issued for special ‘girdawari’ (revenue survey) to assess crop damage due to the rains so that compensation can be provided to those affected, the CM said.Several parts of Rajasthan have been lashed by heavy rains for days, leading to a flood-like situation in many areas. Hundreds of people in different districts have been evacuated from low-lying areas.After excessive rains in Hadoti region, comprising Kota, Jhalawar, and Baran in last several days, the situation has started normalizing on Sunday. No new casualty or rescue operation was conducted on Sunday.With the weakening of the low pressure system, heavy rainfall activities have reduced in the state bringing respite to people who have been affected due to incessant rainfall particularly in Kota division.However, Baran continues to face rain but there to the situation is improving as the water level is declining.“The district witnessed 1000 mm rains this season, which is probably the highest after 2011. Leaving Mangrol and Anta area, mostly every areas of the district was affected with incessant rains, especially Shahbad, Kishanganj, Atru and Chhabra,” said Rajendra Vijay, Collector Baran.Meanwhile, over the past few days, sultry weather has prevailed at many places in Punjab and Haryana, including common capital Chandigarh.Chandigarh and its surrounding areas were pounded by heavy rainfall, providing some relief to people from sultry weather. Adjoining towns Mohali (Punjab) and Panchkula (Haryana) also witnessed heavy showers.Chandigarh recorded a maximum temperature of 34.7 degrees Celsius during the day. In Punjab, Gurdaspur registered a high of 33.5 degrees Celsius, Amritsar 35 degrees Celsius, Ludhiana 33.4 degrees Celsius and Patiala 34.2 degrees Celsius. Light to moderate rain along with thundershower occurred at a few places over eastern Uttar Pradesh, the MeT Department said.IMD Director General Mrutunjay Mohapatra said the monsoon trough is moving towards the western foothills of the Himalayas. He said rainfall is likely to decrease over north Indian plains and increase over the hills.The entire monsoon trough is likely to shift close to the foothills of the Himalayas during the next 24 to 48-hours, the IMD said. A cyclonic circulation lies over northeast Madhya Pradesh, it added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/floodhit-raj-mp-announce-aid-rain-continues-in-north-101628447472054.html
09-08-2021||India||Political parties in Tamil Nadu prep for upcoming local body polls||Political parties in Tamil Nadu are preparing themselves for the upcoming local body elections, the first since the assembly polls were held on April 6 and the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) is focussing on the western region, the only districts where it fared poorly in the April 6 assembly polls.Chief minister and DMK president M K Stalin huddled with district secretaries on Sunday to discuss the polls. The Supreme Court has ordered the Tamil Nadu state election body to complete rural local body polls in nine newly created districts before September 15. Before the end of the year elections to urban local bodies will be conducted. Elections to urban local bodies were last held in October 2011 and after their five year tenure was over issues over delimitation of wards arose and stalled the elections.But elections to 27 rural local bodies were completed in 2011.“Their tenure will continue,” said a senior DMK leader who was part of the meeting. “Today’s meeting focussed on the nine districts and since it is the first election since our win, the chief minister wants us to build on the goodwill gained so far,” he added.MLAs and MPs belonging to the nine new districts--Vellore, Ranipet, Tirupattur, Kancheepuram, Chengalpet, Villupuram, Kallakuruchi, Tirunelvelu, Tenkasi-- were also present at the meeting. These regions are predominantly in the south which is the DMK’s stronghold and north where the party performed well, but the DMK is working to weaken the opposition AIADMK’s hold in the western region. The alliance led by DMK won just 17 of the 50 seats in the region, while it almost swept all other regions in the state. The AIADMK-led alliance with the BJP won the remaining 33. The western belt, also known as the Kongu region, is also the only place where the BJP enjoys considerable support in comparison to its unpopularity elsewhere in the state and the national party hopes to grow from here. Two of BJP’s four MLAs are from this region. The BJP has formed a 17-member panel to prep for the local body polls. “We will study our strengths in the panchayats, municipalities and corporations to analyse where we can contest,” said Karu Nagarajan, BJP’s state general secretary and a committee member. “As a first step we will collect nominations and then we will plan our strategy, campaign before sitting down with our alliance partners.”The DMK inducted three MLAs from the western belt into its cabinet and also saw to it that it has representation from the largely present Gounder community from here to which former chief minister Edappadi Palanswami belongs. The DMK has been poaching strong leaders from the western region belonging to the AIADMK and Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM). Stalin while inducting Haasan’s lieutenant turned rebel R Mahendran in July had said that the party would have fared better in the west if people like Mahendran were with the DMK. “Even while campaigning from last year, we were focussed on building our strength in the western region. We need to do more there,” the DMK leader said. The party is hoping that its popularity close on the heels of forming the government will help them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-parties-in-tamil-nadu-prep-for-upcoming-local-body-polls-101628447411905.html
09-08-2021||India||Govt data highlights waning scope of all-party meetings||The ambit of the long-standing culture of holding all-party meetings on crucial national and international issues appears to have narrowed over the years, government data indicates, with such meetings largely focussing on parliamentary affairs in recent years.While the all-party meetings were mostly chaired by the Prime Minister, the home ministry and the finance ministry on various issues in the governments led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh, a large majority of those under the current ruling dispensation have been chaired by the parliamentary affairs ministry for the smooth functioning of the House, the official data shows.Records available with the ministry of parliamentary affairs show that Prime Minister Vajpayee’s government was most active in calling such meetings. Between 1998 and 2004, the Vajpayee government held 31 all-party meetings during its six years.To be sure, the Narendra Modi-led government has held more such meetings — 26 — in the last seven years than the Manmohan Singh-led government, which held 17 all-party meetings in 10 years, according to the official records.The data shows that during the last seven years, routine all-party meetings have been held every year ahead of Parliament sessions. The meetings were organised on the same subject: smooth functioning of the sessions.On three occasions of the 26 gatherings, all related to the raging pandemic, Prime Minister Modi chaired the meetings with floor leaders of Parliament since March 2020. The three meetings were crucial, as many policy directives including those on how to end the federal lockdown were discussed, and the Centre announced that the lockdown would not be stopped abruptly. One meeting, in September 2016, was chaired by the Union home minister on the state of affairs in Jammu & Kashmir. The 23 remaining meetings were chaired by the parliamentary affairs minister or his ministry, the data shows.In the previous two regimes, the PM, home minister and the finance minister presided a larger number of all-party meetings.Vajpayee presided over 23 out of the 31 meetings that were called on a variety of subjects under his leadership. On March 10, 2003, floor leaders met to discuss “the evolving situation with regard to Iraq” followed by another meeting on the “current situation in Iraq” on March 22 in the same year. In 1998, months after Vajpayee came to power, two all-party meetings were held on the women’s reservation bill on October 7 and December 9.A drought situation in 2000 and an earthquake in Gujarat in the same year led to an all-party meeting headed by the Prime Minister. During Singh’s government, parliamentary party leaders met to discuss “rising prices of essential commodities in India” on November 23, 2009. A meeting was also held on the land acquisition bill on April 9 and 18, 2013, while Reservation in Promotions SCs & STs in the Posts and Services was discussed at an all-party meeting at PM Singh’s residence on August 8, 2012.The latest all-party meeting on Covid-19 in the current government was held on July 18. PM Modi chaired the physical meeting at the Parliament annex and the Union health ministry gave a detailed briefing to several floor leaders on the progress related to vaccines, and management of the pandemic.An all-party meeting chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh was a near possibility during the ongoing Parliament session to end the logjam over Opposition protests triggered by the Pegasus issue and over three contentious farm laws. It, however, has not happened so far as the Opposition has remained firm on its demand for a debate on the Pegasus row. Government managers, who were negotiating with the Opposition leaders for a breakthrough, saw little merit in such a meeting when the outcome appeared to be predetermined, a person aware of the matter said.“It is always expected that the government of the day will hold all-party meetings on important internal and external developments regularly. All-party meetings can, at times, facilitate better functioning of Parliament, but frequent consultations with other parties, taking them on board, can help bring down political temperature of the country. In the past, Prime Minister PV Narsimha Rao had even sent Leader of the Opposition Atal Bihari Vajpayee to UNGA,” said former Lok Sabha secretary general P Sreedharan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-data-highlights-waning-scope-of-all-party-meetings-101628447356777.html
09-08-2021||India||Dictator, corrupt, sin: MP lists words to be avoided in assembly||Traitor, curse, mad thief, sycophant, dictator, sin, pity, black-marketing and corrupt are among the list of words and phrases that have been expunged from the proceedings of the Madhya Pradesh legislative assembly from 1954 till March 2021, according to a booklet prepared by state assembly officers consisting of 1,161 words and phrases that are deemed unparliamentary.Now, legislators have been asked to avoid these words and phrases during assembly proceedings, said AP Singh, principal secretary, Madhya Pradesh assembly.On the eve of the four-day long monsoon session, the state assembly on Sunday released this 38-page booklet, which lists out a number of unparliamentary words, phrases and sentences - mostly in Hindi.According to the booklet, use of misnomers like Pappu, Mr Bantadhar, Jhoota, Farzi Patrakar, Godi, Feku, Mamu among others will also be out of bounds for legislators. Similarly, they will be asked not take names of wife and other relatives of fellow MLAs and ministers.The booklet was released at the Vidhan Sabha Bhavan on Sunday by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, state Congress chief Kamal Nath, parliamentary affairs minister Narottam Mishra and assembly speaker Girish Gautam.Legislators will also be asked not to use some of the Hindi proverbs and idioms, such as ‘chullu bhar pani mein doob jana’, ‘gobar ganesh’, ‘Ali Baba chalis chor’ among others.“During the session, we have to expunge many unparliamentary and indecent words from the proceedings record book. So, we have decided to give them clarity on the use of words in the assembly,” said assembly speaker Girish Gautam.Parliament of India has already prepared a list of words that are not allowed to be used by members of the Houses under Article 105(2) of the Constitution of India.“Ban on using unparliamentary words doesn’t mean that session will be so serious. The MLAs should read some literature and can use some decent light words to attack on each other on a lighter note,” the assembly speaker added.However, several opposition leaders have expresses dissatisfaction over the ban of many words which they claimed are commonly used to attack the state government.“Corruption, fake, black-marketing and injustice are some of the words which we use commonly to expose irregularity in the system. Now, the assembly speaker wants to keep us mum in the house. We also want ban on misnomer, but it is wrong to ban use of common words,” said Govind Singh, senior Congress leader.However, ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders in the state have welcomed the decision to ban these words.Minister of medical education Vishwas Sarang said, “Instead of raising issue related to common man, Congress MLAs do personal attack. By using indecent words, they try to mislead the assembly and avoid fruitful discussion. This book is very necessary to teach them.”Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said it was necessary to maintain decency in the House and this book will help MLAs to check their conduct and words in the assembly.Political analyst Girija Shankar said, “This book has so many words which are very common, and it is impossible for any MLA not to use it while accusing each other. It is basically to stop the personal attacks and using misnomers in the house as it has increased a lot in the House.”An official from the assembly said the booklet will be given to the members of the House on Monday, before the session begins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dictator-corrupt-sin-mp-lists-words-to-be-avoided-in-assembly-101628447292732.html
09-08-2021||India||Putin to attend UNSC debate chaired by PM Modi||Russian President Vladimir Putin, Democratic Republic of Congo President Felix- Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo, who is also president of the African Union, and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken are among several heads of states and governments and world leaders who are expected to attend the UN Security Council high-level debate on Maritime Security that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will chair on Monday.UN diplomats familiar with the organisation of the meeting said confirmations are still coming in and the list of those likely to participate in the debate could grow.The meeting on Monday will be the first UN Security Council debate to be chaired by an Indian prime minister, though this is the eighth time that India has the rotational presidency of the top world body as a non-permanent member. Modi will chair the debate virtually in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.The Maritime Security debate is the first of three signature events India is holding as Security Council chair for the month of August. The other two are debates on UN Peacekeeping, to which India has been a generous and steadfast contributor, and counter-terrorism, which is a subject India has championed at the world body for decades as a leading victim, especially from state-sponsored groups and individuals across its western border. External affairs minister S Jaishankar will chair the other two, and in person at the UN headquarters in New York City.President Putin’s participation was noted as a significant gesture as he rarely attends such debates; the last one, people familiar with the matter, said was possibly 15 years ago.DRC’s President Tshisekedi is participating in the debate as a briefer on behalf of the African Union, 54 of whose members are part of the 55-member African Group, which is the largest group of geographically categorised groups that UN members are divided into. Prime Minister of St Vincent and Grenadines Ralph Gonsalves was confirmed as a participant as well, but has pulled out for health reasons and will be represented by his son, who is a member of the cabinet.Meanwhile, India’s presidency of the UNSC faced its first pushback and from expected quarters. Pakistan has reacted strongly to the UNSC’s rejection of its formal request to attend the Friday briefing by the UN Assistance Mission on Afghanistan (UNMA) on the evolving security situation in the country as US-led international forces end their 20-year presence.“It is a matter of deep regret that, as the closest neighbour of Afghanistan, whose contribution in the ongoing peace process has been recognised by the international community, Pakistan’s request to the President of the Security Council to address the Council’s session and present its perspective on the Afghan peace process and the way forward was not acceded to,” Pakistan’s ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement Saturday.Pakistan had indeed made a formal request, but people familiar with the matter said, “it was turned down because, one, neighbours do not automatically qualify to attend or address under rules, as are affected countries — Afghanistan attended. And, two, where do you stop if all neighbours make the same request, to attend.”Some of Afghanistan’s other neighbouring countries had indeed expressed the desire to attend and address the meeting, but they were politely turned down as well, citing the same reason.Pakistan took aim in the comment at the president of the council, which for the month of August is India. But, the people cited earlier insisted, the decision to keep out neighbours was taken collectively by the UN Security Council as a body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/putin-to-attend-unsc-debate-chaired-by-pm-101628447113771.html
09-08-2021||India||NIA raids 56 J&K areas in terror funding case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Sunday raided 56 locations linked to the alleged members of the banned Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) group across 14 districts in Jammu and Kashmir as part of its probe in a terror funding case, the agency said in a statement.The Centre banned the JeI for five years after the Pulwama attack, in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troopers were killed, under anti-terror laws on the grounds that it was “in close touch” with terror outfits and was likely to “escalate secessionist movement” in the region. A notification, banning the group under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, was issued by the ministry of home affairs after a high-level meeting on security chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in February 2019.“Searches conducted today included the premises of office bearers of the proscribed association, its members and also offices of trusts purportedly run by JeI,” NIA said in a statement. NIA added that during the searches held across the districts of Srinagar, Budgam, Ganderbal, Baramulla, Kupwara, Bandipora, Anantnag, Shopian, Pulwama, Kulgam, Ramban, Doda, Kishtwar and Rajouri, “various incriminating documents and electronic devices were seized from the premises of the suspects”.Hundreds of JeI members, including its chief Abdul Hameed Fayaz, were arrested by the J&K Police in a major crackdown after the outfit was banned. Fayaz continues to be behind bars.“The members of the organisation have been collecting funds domestically and abroad through donations particularly in the form of Zakat, Mowda and Bait-ul-Mal (religious donations) purportedly to further charity and other welfare activities but these funds are instead being used for violent and secessionist activities,” the NIA statement added.The central anti-terror agency added that the funds collected by the JeI were being used to help terrorist groups.“The funds raised by JeI are also being channelised to proscribed terrorist organisations such as Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and others through well-organised networks of JeI cadres,” the statement said.NIA also said that the JeI was motivating “impressionable youth of Kashmir and recruiting new members in J&K to participate in disruptive secessionist activities.”“Further investigation in the case continues,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/niaraids-56-j-k-areas-in-terror-funding-case-101628447112413.html
09-08-2021||India||Ujjwala scheme 2.0 beneficiaries to get free stove, refill||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch the second version of Ujjwala free cooking gas connection scheme along with “a free refill and a stove” on Tuesday from Mahoba district of poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, in a bid to replicate the success of its first version that earned political goodwill for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2017 UP assembly elections, two people aware of the development said.Under Ujjwala 2.0, the Union government will distribute about 10 million gas connections this financial year to the poor along with a free refill and a stove, they said, asking not to be named. About five years ago, ahead of the crucial UP polls, PM Modi launched the first version of the scheme (Ujjwala 1.0) in Ballia district on May 1, 2016.Ujjwala 2.0 is also expected to give a free refill worth over ₹800 and a free stove, one of the people quoted above said. “Earlier under Ujjwala 1.0, only a deposit free LPG connection was provided to the beneficiary amounting to a financial assistance of ₹1,600, where beneficiaries also had an option to take loan at zero interest rate from the public sector oil marketing companies for the hot plate (stove) and the first refill,” the person added.On Tuesday, the Prime Minister will also deliver a speech. The event will be attended by Union petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, a government spokesperson said.The intent of the scheme was announced in this year’s annual budget. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1 announced extending the scheme to 10 million new beneficiaries in 2021-22. “Ujjwala Scheme which has benefited 8 crores [80 million] households will be extended to cover 1 crore [10 million] more beneficiaries,” she said in her Budget speech.Besides free first refill and a stove along with a deposit-free gas connection, the scheme in its new form will have a provision for online application. A migrant family can also get separate gas connections, the person said.“Preference would be given to poor families belonging to the scheduled castes (SCs) and scheduled tribes (STs) and also for families residing in areas with lower LPG [liquefied petroleum gas] penetration than the national or state average,” the person said.Applicants will be required to fill a simplified know-your-customer (KYC) form, which would not require any notarised affidavit. Migrants can provide self-declaration if they don’t have a proof of address, the person added. People can apply online through the dedicated portal or common service centres, or through local gas agencies belonging to the state-run oil marketing companies (OMCs) – Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd, the person said.Ujjwala 1.0, also known as the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), was launched in 2016 to provide only deposit-free LPG connections to the women of poor households.Initially, the target was set to provide 50 million LPG connections with the budgetary provision of ₹8,000 crore over a period of three years starting from FY 2016-17. Subsequently, considering the success of PMUY in providing access of clean cooking fuel and its resultant health, environment and economic benefits, the target was revised to 80 million connections with the total budget of ₹12,800 crore up to FY 2019-20, the second person said.The target beneficiaries were initially selected from the Socio-Economic Caste Census of 2011 (SECC Data) and the scope was later expanded to more categories to include deprived women in poor households.“The target to distribute 8 crore [80 million] LPG connections under the scheme was successfully accomplished in September 2019, seven months ahead of the target date. Implementation of PMUY has resulted in increase in national LPG coverage from 61.9% to 99.99 % as on July 1, 2021,” the person added.As there has been a gap of about 18 months since the last connection under Ujjwala 1.0 was given, the petroleum ministry is using the term Ujjwala 2.0 for this phase of the scheme, the person said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ujjwala-scheme-2-0-beneficiaries-to-get-free-stove-refill-101628447111919.html
09-08-2021||India||Govt may begin migrant data collection this week||The Union government is likely to launch by this week a digitised platform for migrant workers that will enable authorities to direct state-run benefits to them and intervene during crises, people aware of the matter said on Sunday. This follows a Supreme Court order in June that set a deadline of July 31 for the move.Last summer, tens of thousands of low-paid workers made an exodus on foot from major cities such as Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai under without much food or money following the stringent national lockdown during the first wave of Covid-19. In September 2020, then labour minister Santosh Gangwar told Parliament that the government had no data on how many such people left the cities or how many died in the lockdown.The migrant workers’ portal is expected to fill this gap. It is a joint venture between the labour and employment ministry and common service-centres (CSC) run by the electronics and information technology ministry, the people quote above said.“The portal is fully ready and we will be in a position to begin registration of workers anytime and possibly go live by this week,” a labour ministry official aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity.The platform will allow migrants to register themselves and secure a unique ID to access the portal from a CSC. The CSCs are points of access to a host of government digital services across the country and there are nearly 400,000 of them. “The ID can be used to access government schemes and services, irrespective of their place of stay,” an IT ministry official said, asking not to be named.Workers in the informal economy are estimated to contribute nearly 50% to the country’s gross domestic product. “One is not clear given the humongous task of registration whether this project will be completed in the near future. The first part is registration, of course,” said KR Syam Sundar, an economist with the Xaviers Labour Relations Institute, Jamshedpur.According to Sundar, the Supreme Court is aware of the “governments’ apathy in complying with critical procedural requirements concerning unorganised workers over the (past) decade and a half”.On June 29, the apex court, while hearing a case on the plight of workers in the unorganised sector, set a deadline of July 31 for the government to “prepare a mechanism” for the registration of such workers. Similar deadlines had been set in 2018 and 2019 as well.Workers will be registered as and when they apply and that could take time. “But we will launch a big awareness drive so that nobody is left behind,” said the labour ministry official.While there are no official estimates on the total number of migrant workers, a novel statistical tool developed by former chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian had revealed an annual “interstate migrant population of about 60 million and an interdistrict migration as high as 80 million” between 2001 and 2011.According to the second official cited above, the portal is similar to a platform that the Gujarat government launched last month for construction workers to access the state’s welfare schemes. The Gujarat portal saw a registration of over 100,000 workers within a fortnight of launch, the official said.While the unique identification number allotted to migrants will be similar to the biometric Aadhaar, the unique ID will not be made mandatory for registration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-may-begin-migrant-data-collection-this-week-101628446934825.html

09-08-2021||India||Discovery of new animal, plant species from India dip due to Covid-19 pandemic||The Covid-19 pandemic has taken a toll on the discovery of new animal and plant species in India. The number of discoveries of plant and animal species, some of which are unknown to humans, by scientists of the Botanical Survey of India and Zoological Survey of India has dropped over the past one year.Scientists have not been able to travel to remote corners and biodiversity rich areas of the country because of the lockdown and travel restrictions imposed by various states. The budget has also been slashed.“There has been a drop in the discovery of plant species this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Because of the pan-India lockdown, restriction on travel imposed by several states and the raging Coronavirus, scientists could not travel to remote areas. The budget has also been slashed for which field tours had to be curtailed,” said AA Mao, BSI director.Even though on an average the BSI discovers around 350 plant species, starting from flowering plants to ferns, fungi and algae, this year this has come down to around 250, a BSI scientist said. Around 180 are new to science, while the rest have never been reported from India earlier.Every year the ZSI and BSI, both headquartered in Kolkata, come up with annual publications listing the few hundred animal and plants that are discovered.For new discoveries, scientists depend on field trips to remote and biodiversity-rich areas of the country such as Himalayas, Western Ghats and the Nicobar islands in Bay of Bengal among others. Samples are collected and brought back to the laboratories for analysis and identification.“But over the past one-and-half-years such field surveys have virtually come to a halt. During this time ZSI scientists had to primarily depend on the samples, which they collected during earlier field trips. Not all samples which are collected can be analysed. They are kept in store. These were analysed this time and we came up with a few hundred new species,” said Dhriti Banerjee, ZSI director.The ZSI, which discovers around 350 species on an average, came up with around 200 new findings this year. Most of them are new to mankind.In 2020, ZSI reported at least 364 animal species which were unknown to humans while another 116 species of animals, which were earlier found elsewhere in the world but not recorded from India, were also discovered.“We had taken a few one-day field trips but the long-duration trips which allow exploring remote areas in forests could not be undertaken because of travel restrictions. Also, some scientists got infected,” said a ZSI scientist.Before publishing a research paper on identification of new species if there is any confusion the scientists re-visit the area from where the first sample was collected and try to collect a sample of the opposite sex to verify. As long trips could not be done some identification tasks got stuck midway.Till date scientists have been able to identify 102,161 species of animals – starting from the one-celled protozoans to large animals such as elephants and tigers. This is around 6.52% of the global share. More than 50,000 species of plants have also been identified from the country.“It was in March 2020 that I went for my last field trip to Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh. I had come back just two days before the pan-India lockdown started. Over the past one year I focused mostly on laboratory work -- analysing old samples, studying literature, preparing herbarium and studying plants in the Botanic Garden,” said a senior scientist of the BSI.Scientists from across the globe have managed to identify 1.8 million species till date which is only a small fraction of the estimated 30 to 50 million species thought to exist in the world. India ranks 8th in the world with its 1.02 lakh speciesThis year the publications are yet to be published. Officials in the ZSI and BSI said that they are likely to be published soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/discovery-of-new-animal-plant-species-from-india-dip-due-to-covid-19-pandemic-101628360766054.html
09-08-2021||Today's||To take on China, rely on diplomacy and strong counter-measures||The agreement for mutual disengagement of troops by China and India at the friction point of Gogra in eastern Ladakh is a step forward for restoring the status quo ante of April 2020, when Chinese forces made a series of preplanned intrusions across the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Including Gogra, Galwan and Pangong Tso, the two sides have now stepped back at three contested points, while the standoff continues at other strategic locations and is unlikely to be speedily resolved.Nonetheless, there are lessons to be learnt from the three areas where China and India have disengaged. The first is that sustained diplomacy yields dividends. Thanks to several rounds of talks, the two Asian giants have avoided an intensified conflict that seemed a possibility after the Galwan clash. The joint poring over of maps of each military’s perceptional lines and claims at LAC, and interactions, have conveyed in direct terms what each side wants and prefers, and shown where the potential for mutual pullbacks lies. The subtle involvement of Russia as a creative go-between to lower the heat has also helped.Also Read | India calibrates its South China Sea approachWhile China and India nurse long-term suspicions of each other’s intentions, goals and international alignments — and these will not dissipate anytime soon — the LAC crisis diplomacy has focused on tactical specifics at the friction points. The message is that the two neighbours will not stop competing for power and influence in Asia and beyond, but they can manage the disputed border situation from sliding into war.The second lesson is that diplomatic parleys are necessary but not sufficient. Without a demonstration of military deterrence and resolve, an aggressive and expansive China cannot be sweet-talked into dismantling its bunkers and semi-permanent structures or driving back its tanks and armoured vehicles to pre-April 2020 positions.China has withdrawn from three encroached portions only after witnessing India’s willingness to use countervailing force, do mirror deployment or outnumber the Chinese military at some points, and mount counter-offensives across what China claims to be its side of LAC. The reality is that India redeemed itself after the Chinese offensive in April-May 2020 by displaying no hesitation to spill blood or pay China back in its own coin. The concept of “offensive defence” has guided India’s strategic infrastructure-building and force projection at LAC throughout this crisis, and this has compelled China to recalculate the costs and benefits of its expansionism.The third lesson is that since diplomatic resolution of the crisis is dependent on military operations and show of strategic determination, India must persist on the path of “peace through strength”.The Narendra Modi government has to keep bringing bargaining chips to the dialogue like it did in 2020 by occupying the strategic heights of the Kailash range of mountains, and letting the Chinese know that India can neutralise China’s bilateral asymmetry in military and economic power through other cards. This may include activating and operationalising Quad to apply multilateral counterbalancing pressure in the Indo-Pacific; imposing greater barriers to Chinese goods, technology and investments; and reopening the sensitive issues of the status of Tibet and Taiwan.A difficult path lies ahead in India-China relations, especially as the India-United States (US) strategic partnership is maturing and China-US ties are plumbing the depths. With approximately 50,000 troops on each side remaining at LAC, the potential for fresh violence cannot be ruled out. While Indian military proactiveness has proven to be an imperative to get China to make limited concessions, this kind of equilibrium is unstable and risks unwarranted escalation.Peace through strength is a delicate tightrope walk. But the gauntlet China has thrown is such that India does not have the option of shying away from matching Chinese moves on the ground and in world capitals. Only a combination of bravery and wisdom can succeed in this long-drawn-out crisis.Sreeram Chaulia is the author of the forthcoming book, Crunch Time: Narendra Modi’s National Security CrisesThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/to-take-on-china-rely-on-diplomacy-military-resolve-and-strong-countermeasures-101628518517153.html
09-08-2021||Today's||Oxygen for India: Building a more resilient health system||In 2020–21, air became more valuable than gold. Shortages of medical oxygen for Covid-19 patients hit hospitals around the world — Brazil, Peru, Nigeria, Jordan, Italy, and the United States.But nowhere was the problem more acute than in India, which suffered a spike in cases due to both the rapid spread of the coronavirus in crowded cities and the heightened transmissibility of the Delta variant of the virus. Many Indians died in their homes, unable to secure admission to a hospital, while the hospitals themselves were running out of oxygen.Medical oxygen is among the most essential and best understood of medical interventions. The earliest use of medical oxygen dates back to 1798, when Thomas Beddoes, considered the father of respiratory therapy, used oxygen and nitrous oxide to treat asthma, congestive heart failure, and other ailments. The first oxygen cylinders, which could be used in general anaesthesia, were developed in 1868. Oxygen’s role in acute care was established by, among others, George Holtzapple, who used it to manage a young pneumonia patient in 1885.Also Read | HT Explains | The pandemic’s missing AI response and why India should careThe need for oxygen goes well beyond Covid-19, and shortages are a constant problem in India. Pregnant women and children with pneumonia can die without supplemental oxygen. Improving the quality of the oxygen programme at health facilities in Papua New Guinea reduced overall pediatric deaths by 40% and deaths due to pneumonia by 50%. Hypoxemia, lack of oxygen in the bloodstream, can cause complications in a range of conditions, including severe malaria, cardiovascular disease, and traumas that cause blood loss.Supplemental oxygen helps buy the body time while doctors treat the source of the problem. Doctors also administer oxygen when patients are put under anaesthesia in surgery.As the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in India has highlighted, shortages of medical oxygen are not uncommon in urban India, and it is not available at all in remote areas.The pre-Covid-19 system relied almost entirely on liquid medical oxygen (LMO), which is generated largely for industrial use. Only 15% of liquid oxygen is directed to medical uses.Eighty per cent of India’s LMO is generated in just eight states and then transported to other states. But liquid oxygen cannot be moved quickly, and transportation infrastructure problems create shortages outside of tier-1 and tier-2 cities.Oxygen resources — pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants, oxygen concentrators, and cylinders — have recently entered the country with both significant investment from the national government and support from private philanthropy. PSA plants use an adsorbent like zeolite to separate nitrogen from air under pressure. With funds from PM CARES and contributions from donors, the Government of India has committed to providing one PSA plant and one LMO storage tank for every district headquarters.All told, an estimated 1,500 PSA plants, 200,000 oxygen concentrators, and 100,000 cylinders are now available not only to tackle any future waves of Covid-19, but also help save lives at risk from several other health conditions.The opportunity exists to leverage all those PSA plants, concentrators, and cylinders to plug gaps in the existing system. But if such a grid is not assembled carefully, the new oxygen assets could displace or interrupt existing LMO systems and put small fillers and transporters out of business. PSA plants and concentrators need regular maintenance — something most Indian health care facilities cannot provide. We could face a situation where the current oxygen ecosystem is disrupted, with no stable system to replace it.An ideal oxygen grid for the country would work much like an electricity grid, with central generation (LMO), transmission (tankers and cylinders), storage (liquid and gaseous), and decentralised production (PSA generators and oxygen concentrators).No electricity grid would rely on just decentralised solar or micro-hydro plants, without centralised transmission and distribution; similarly, a reliable national oxygen grid should have multiple generation and storage components.Other issues are specific to an oxygen grid. LMO is cheap to produce but expensive to transport over long distances into remote areas. PSA plants can be helpful in places that are poorly served by LMO suppliers but require significant inputs of electricity and are not economically viable as standalone operations. Oxygen concentrators also consume large amounts of electricity.Both PSA plants and concentrators have compressors and moving parts and are, therefore, susceptible to breakdown under harsh conditions; backup from other generation or storage options is required. We know of remote health centres that requested concentrators but are now returning them because they are simply unusable. Oxygen does have one advantage over electricity: It is easier to store.A sustainable oxygen grid — one that supplies medical oxygen when and where it is required — needs both centralised and decentralised production, plus reliable transmission, and storage. Such a system would ensure that rural areas are served and that oxygen can be diverted to hotspots.The coronavirus pandemic has given us the opportunity to build back better. We can, and should, develop a medical oxygen infrastructure that can keep pace with our ongoing needs, the pandemic, and any future threat.Ramanan Laxminarayan is an economist, epidemiologist, and founder of OxygenForIndia.org.

09-08-2021||Today's||A Taliban takeover will hurt Pakistan||Afghanistan stands on the edge of an abyss. The Taliban’s resurgence is aided by many factors. The Doha Agreement, a symbol of the US defeat, has been a huge psychological setback for the Afghan people and government. The Afghan National Defence and Security Forces do not have adequate mobility, medevac, weaponry, or ammunition. Besides providing sanctuary and sustenance, the Pakistan army has opened supply lines for the Taliban and gives it military guidance. The leadership in Afghanistan is still in disarray. There is no operational unity among the Afghan government and the communities willing to fight for Afghan sovereignty and republicanism. The Afghan government is also losing the propaganda war. The Taliban’s current momentum on the battlefield is magnified manifold by the pervasive defeatism of western media, which is projecting Kabul’s fall as imminent.The existential situation looks bleak. The fall of Zaranj, the capital of Nimroz province, was quickly followed by Taliban victories in the northern towns of Shebergan, Kunduz, and Sare-Pol. The Taliban victories in the north are a signal to the Uzbek and Tajik communities that their supposed strongholds are vulnerable.Also Read | Taliban capture key cities in north Afghanistan, US deploys B-52 bombersKunduz had fallen twice before, in 2015 and 2016, but was retaken. Kunduz is infamous as the last remaining bastion of the Taliban in November 2001, from where the cornered Taliban, al-Qaeda, and Pakistani fighters were allowed to be airlifted to Pakistan. Zaranj is the starting point of the road that India built in 2008 connecting to the Kandahar-Herat highway at Delaram. Even at that time, except for the road’s two end-points, the Taliban’s presence in Nimroz was ubiquitous. The India construction team moved forward in a security bubble of considerable strength to protect against repeated Taliban attacks. The Taliban has also launched offensives against Kandahar, Lashkar Gah, and Herat. Ultimately, given their proximity to the Pakistan’s border, the provinces of Kandahar, Helmand, Zabul, and Uruzgan are vulnerable.Diplomatic activity is centred in Doha. The extended troika, comprising China, Pakistan, Russia, and the United States (Afghanistan is not a member, though its representatives are expected to be present along with those of the Taliban) is meeting in Doha on August 10. The Qatari special envoy for Afghanistan, Mutlaq bin Majed Al-Qahtani, has just concluded two days of consultations in New Delhi. The special representatives for Afghanistan are meeting in Doha on August 12. Meanwhile, on the ground, Britain’s chief of defence staff, General Nick Carter, is shuttling between Kabul and Islamabad brokering talks between Pakistan army’s chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, and President Ashraf Ghani.The people of Afghanistan are unlikely to allow a peace dictated by the Taliban, which is seen as a proxy for Pakistan. While they might be compelled to compromise on the preservation of democracy, human rights, and pluralism, they want to draft the new constitution themselves and are loath to accept dictation. A return to the status quo ante might not be as easy as it appears.Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) believes it can continue to guide the Haqqani network and other sundry terrorist groups it supports, even after the Taliban gains power. This seems improbable. When the Taliban was in power earlier, Pakistan’s ambassador, Aziz Ahmad Khan, was unable to present his credentials to the Afghan head of State, Mullah Omar. When approached on the issue, Mullah Omar said that Pakistan and Afghanistan had fraternal relations, which precluded the formality of State-to-State relations. Another time, Pakistan’s foreign minister tried to get Mullah Omar to settle the Durand Line once for all. He got scolded for his labours — how dare he raise the subject of frontiers between two brothers!Pakistan’s State structure, underpinned by its army, will come under strain if Afghanistan is Talibanised. There is no love lost between the Taliban leadership and the Pakistan army because of the coercion it has been subject to since the time it took refuge in Pakistan. Mullah Abdul Salam Zaef, one of the co-founders of the Taliban, wrote a long section in his autobiography about the abusive behaviour of ISI, which he said was so reputed for its perfidy that it could take milk out of bulls!It is terrorist groups such as the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), East Turkestan Islamic Movement, and Lashkar-e-Taiba, which will gain strategic space in Afghanistan, not Pakistan. Though the focus of the Taliban and TTP are different, there has not been a single case of an attack by the Taliban on TTP, despite ISI wanting it. Intelligence agencies such as the ISI tend to be overconfident about their hold over their assets, who have no permanent loyalties, except to their core cause.India followed the Afghan government’s lead in its contacts with the Taliban. There is, unsurprisingly, great resentment in the Pakistani establishment about this development. In the context of India’s contacts with the Taliban’s Doha office in June, Pakistan’s national security adviser, Moeed Yusuf, said in an interview to The Dawn TV News that it is “a matter of shame” for India to have engaged with the Taliban.Pakistan has an opportunity to right past wrongs and help secure Afghanistan’s peace, stability, sovereignty, and independence, instead of undermining these. Pakistan’s spite for Afghanistan and paranoia for India cloud its judgment. These impel policy choices that Pakistan will come to regret.Jayant Prasad is a retired diplomat who served as India’s ambassador to AfghanistanThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/a-taliban-takeover-will-hurt-pakistan-101628516415772.html
09-08-2021||Today's||Regardless of season or size, Singapore-India ties remain robust at 56||August is a special month for Singapore. We celebrate two important occasions on August 8 and 9 — the establishment of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1967, and the independence of modern Singapore in 1965, respectively. August also holds special meaning for India. On August 15, 1947, India emerged from British rule to become an independent country. While nation-building is a never ending task, both Singaporeans and Indians have much to be proud of. Our two nations have built multi-racial, multi-religious societies based on equality and the rule of law. India is a longstanding friend of Singapore and was one of the first countries to recognise our independence. The historical, literary, cultural and economic ties go back many centuries. Many Singaporeans have family ties in India. When Covid-19 first hit last year, India supported Singapore by keeping the supply chains of essential goods open. India subsequently found itself confronting the second wave, and I am glad that Singapore could reciprocate with our modest contribution of oxygen-related supplies. Singapore and India are natural partners. We must continue with this spirit of collaboration as we navigate a pathway out of the pandemic and re-emerge stronger.Bilaterally, we enjoy close partnership in the economic, security, and people-to-people domains, including on skills and urban development. Singapore has been India’s largest source of foreign direct investment for three consecutive years, averaging $16 billion in total equity inflows annually. We are further deepening our partnership in areas that will become even more salient in the post-pandemic world — fintech, innovation and skills, and digital connectivity.Our bilateral efforts in these areas can also be a pathfinder for others in the region. For example, Singapore is looking into expanding our Business sans Borders (BSB) initiative beyond our pilot partners of India and the Philippines, to all 10 ASEAN member-states. When complete, the BSB initiative will enhance regional economic growth and increase financial inclusion in our local communities. We welcome India’s continued engagement with ASEAN, anchored by India’s “Act East” policy unveiled in 2014 by Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi. Singapore has always been one of the earliest and strongest proponents of closer ASEAN-India ties. We believe that the growth and opening up of India will contribute greatly to peace, prosperity, and stability in our region. The evolving regional architecture will be stronger and enhanced by India’s active participation. As PM Modi said at the 37th Singapore Lecture in November 2015, “In the flux and transition of our times, the most critical need in this region is to uphold and strengthen the rules and norms that must define our collective behaviour”. These words have proven to be prescient as our collective behaviour will determine how quickly the world emerges from the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic.Despite our obvious differences in size, our shared strategic outlook impels us to work for and uphold an open, inclusive, rules-based international system. Isolationism and protectionism will not be the solution to creating opportunities in a world undergoing radical changes in geopolitics and the ongoing digital revolution. We need to invest in our people, our infrastructure and reform our economic structures on the domestic front. We should build support for a rules-based multilateral world order.This is also the central task for ASEAN in the years ahead. At a time of great geostrategic churn, preserving ASEAN unity and centrality and strengthening the multilateral framework will require sustained and concrete actions by both ASEAN member-states and its external partners.With its strategic heft, India can play a unique role in buttressing ASEAN’s efforts. As Singapore commences its three-year term as country coordinator for ASEAN-India Dialogue Relations this month, we will work unremittingly to strengthen the ASEAN-India Strategic Partnership. We invite India to give even fuller expression to its “Act East” policy as ASEAN and India mark 30 years of relations next year.I am confident that Singapore and India will continue to work closely for the mutual benefit of our peoples and the region, just like what we have always done, regardless of season.

09-08-2021||Editorials||When the political class unites||The Opposition’s decision to interrupt its disruption of Parliament to support the Centre’s constitution amendment bill to restore the powers of states and union territories to determine backward groups illustrates what ties, and divides, Indian politics. The rare all-party consensus on the bill is a reflection of how reservations have come to be the holy cow of Indian politics — no party can be remotely seen against it. It is also a reflection of the power of the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) — each party woos this heterogenous category and is apprehensive of doing anything that may come across as insensitive to their aspirations. And it is a reflection of the limits of the imagination of the political class in candidly acknowledging the need for a revision in the architecture of affirmative action in India.Also Read | Amid Pegasus row, MoD tells Rajya Sabha no dealings with NSO GroupThe immediate trigger for the bill was a Supreme Court verdict which scrapped Maratha reservations because it exceeded the 50% reservation cap. But this isn’t the issue the bill seeks to address. In the same verdict, the court underlined that the power to determine classification of backward groups rested with the Centre. But states have had their own lists of OBCs, who are then eligible for state-level education and employment benefits. The court ruling revoked this right, and a plea by the Centre went unheeded. The amendment will restore the power of states to draw and maintain their own list. And in that respect, the bill is necessary. The Centre cannot be the sole authority in determining backwardness, especially when there are widespread local variations. A caste group in one state may, due to historical reasons of backwardness, classify as OBC but not in another.But even as the bill is necessary, the political consensus on it — in the backdrop of acrimony on almost everything else — is telling. For the Bharatiya Janata Party, which has successfully cultivated a huge loyal OBC base, signalling to the community that it is sensitive to its aspirations is necessary, especially in the run up to polls in Uttar Pradesh. For the Opposition, ensuring that states retain the right to determine this list is essential to both preserving its base but also ensuring that the BJP does not walk away with coming across as championing OBC rights. But beyond the political calculus, what India needs is a careful, data-based, just affirmative action policy, for the current architecture has become a tool of power-sharing rather than actually addressing historic injustice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/when-the-political-class-unites-101628519476007.html

The riots happened soon after prolonged protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, a polarised election with communal rhetoric, and the failure of the law and order machinery to anticipate and then tackle the violence. Justice for the riot victims remains elusive, and there are serious questions about the investigation process and whether it is being used to frame dissenters and let the culpable get away. But at the core of it, the riots showed that Hindu-Muslim relations in Delhi are fragile.Also Read | Delhi riots: Couldn’t find source of Tanha’s statement leak, police tells HCAnd that is why recent incidents must serve as a wake-up call for all political parties in Delhi, the Delhi government and the Delhi Police, which reports to the ministry of home affairs. On Friday, a resident federation of the capital’s Dwarka locality organised a mahapanchayat against the construction of a Haj house and wrote a letter to the lieutenant-governor, warning of riots; local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders are active in the campaign. On Sunday, a former city BJP office-bearer organised a rally at Jantar Mantar, ostensibly to demand a uniform civil code. But reports and video footage show that this was marked by hate speech, targeted at Muslims, and a mob trying to force a journalist to chant a religious slogan. The police, on Monday, filed a first information report against “unknown persons” for the slogans.The primary responsibility for keeping the peace lies with the BJP, as the ruling party at the Centre. It must rein in local elements at the forefront of the politics of hate. The Delhi Police has a new commissioner in Rakesh Asthana, who must prove his professional credentials by cracking down early on such potentially volatile incidents. And the Aam Aadmi Party, which governs Delhi, must play a constructive role, along with all local stakeholders, Hindu and Muslim alike, in building trust.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/act-against-rising-communal-rhetoric-in-delhi-101628519055999.html
