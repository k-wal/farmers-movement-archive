07-08-2021||Mumbai||BJP mulls reshuffle in its Maharashtra unit||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is gearing up for ‘mini Assembly elections’ in Maharashtra. There are talks that the party is considering an organisational reshuffle in the state unit. Party top brass is mulling whether they need to put an aggressive Maratha or Other Backward Classes (OBC) face at the top in the state. Meanwhile, speculations are also on over BJP joining hands with the Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS). On Friday, state BJP president Chandrakant Patil called on Thackeray at his residence in Dadar, fuelling speculations over a BJP-MNS tie-up in the civic polls, slated to be held early next year. The meeting is seen as the first step towards an alliance between the two parties. More than 15 municipal corporations (including Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane), 29 of the 36 district councils and over 90 municipal councils will go for polls over the next 18 months. Elections will be held for local bodies across the state, because of which it is also being touted as mini Assembly polls. As such, the polls are crucial for both the ruling three-party coalition as well as the Opposition BJP. On Saturday, Patil reached Delhi along with a group of state BJP leaders to meet Union home minister and senior party leader Amit Shah. A few days ago, Shah also met leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis and former state minister Ashish Shelar, separately. Both Patil and Shelar are considered close to Shah. Significantly, Shelar has been touring the state and meeting local party leaders. According to the BJP insiders, if the party decides to replace Patil with a new state unit chief, Shelar and former state minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule would be the frontrunners. Shelar, who is from the Maratha community, is known for his aggressive style of functioning, while Bawankule is a known OBC face. Considered close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, Bawankule was denied a party ticket in the 2019 Assembly elections. He could be back in contention now as the party is looking for an OBC face, especially when state Congress president Nana Patole has turned aggressive, particularly in the Vidarbha region where BJP has a traditional base among voters, prominently the OBCs. However, Fadnavis said there will be no be changes in the organisational set up. “No organisational changes are going to take place in the state. There was a cabinet reshuffle, and leaders are going to Delhi to meet and greet the new ministers in the ministerial council and also to discuss issues that are related to Maharashtra,” Fadnavis told mediapersons on Saturday. “There is also no discussion on in the party over changing the state BJP president. Existing chief Chandrakant Patil is performing very well. The party and the high command are standing along with him,” he added.Patil, who was in Delhi on Saturday said, no political discussion took place in the meeting between Shah and Fadnavis. “I am expecting to meet Amit bhai and will brief him about discussions held with Raj Thackeray. Ultimately the decision has to be taken by them as it may impact national politics,” he said. While BJP is keen on forging an alliance with MNS, its senior leaders are wary of the reaction of north Indian voters who were at the receiving end of Raj Thackeray’s anti-migrant stand. BJP has clarified that it cannot join hands with MNS unless the latter shreds its regional and linguistic chauvinism and hatred towards outsiders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-mulls-reshuffle-in-its-maharashtra-unit-101628360886506.html
07-08-2021||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay records 68.5% jump in intellectual property filings||The Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) recorded a 68.5% jump in its applications for intellectual property in 2020-21, even as the Covid-19 pandemic shut down the institute and affected grants. The total intellectual property filings, including patents and trademarks, grew from 156 last year to 263 this year. The institute also saw a 45% increase in the number of Indian patents filed this year compared to last year. Researchers in the institute filed almost three times the number of patent applications in the United States compared to last year.In 2020-21, the institute filed for 141 Indian patents and 17 US patents. Of these, 110 Indian and eight US patents have been granted. In comparison, 97 Indian and six US patent applications were filed in the previous year.This increase in the number of patent applications is despite the Covid-19 pandemic shutting the campus down and affecting regular research work. In the past year, the premiere institute also saw a significant drop in research funds, according to data revealed by Subhasis Chaudhuri, director of IIT-B, during the 59th annual convocation held on Saturday. For the second consecutive year, the annual convocation was held in a virtual reality mode with virtual avatars of students receiving degrees from virtual avatars of Chaudhuri and chief guest Geoffrey Hinton, Emeritus Professor at University of Toronto, chief scientific advisor of Vector Institute and vice-president and engineering fellow at Google.The institute shut down its campus completely on March 28 last year as the Covid-19 pandemic raged in the city. An early summer vacation was announced on April 1. However, on June 25, the institute declared that the entire autumn semester will be conducted online to ensure students’ safety. The new batch of engineering students was inducted online. Since then, almost all teaching and academic activities, barring research work, are held online. The pandemic also affected the institute’s receipt in research grants, which fell by almost 14% from ₹331.24 crore in 2019-20 to ₹285 crore in 2020-21.“Despite the pandemic, research and development activities at the institute kept a brisk pace,” said Chaudhuri, who presented a report on the institute’s achievements through the year.“We are happy to note that despite the pandemic, our students did not have to suffer academically. The training that our students received will definitely see them taking up leadership roles, as always, in the academic and corporate world, thus contributing to the needs of our country,” he added. A total of 2,501 degrees were awarded to 2,289 students, apart from 378 PhD degrees. The virtual event was attended by Pawan Goenka, retired managing director and chief executive officer of Mahindra Group and chairperson of the board of governors of IIT-B.“Can no longer assume fascism is a thing of the past”Chief guest at the ceremony, Geoffrey Hinton, emeritus professor at University of Toronto, chief scientific advisor of Vector Institute and vice-president and engineering fellow at Google, asked the students to stand up to truth in the face of political attempts to suppress it.Hinton, who delivered the keynote speech, said, “The amazing technology we have today is the result of curiosity-driven research unfettered by religious or ideological constraints. My generation just assumed that this is how things should be and that humanity would never go back to allowing religious authority or political expediency to dominate scientific discovery, but I now think we cannot take this for granted just as we can no longer assume that fascism is a thing of the past.”He added, “I believe that highly selective and extremely well educated students like yourselves have a moral duty to stand up to the truth in the face of political attempts to suppress it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iitbombay-records-68-5-jump-in-intellectual-property-filings-101628360769177.html
07-08-2021||Chandigarh||94% population in Chandigarh has received first Covid vaccine jab||Medical experts are optimistic that coronavirus transmission in the Union Territory will remain in check as 94% of the eligible residents have received the first dose of the vaccine, and 30% of the population has been fully inoculated. As per the latest electoral list, around 7,29,822 people in Chandigarh are over the age of 18 and are eligible to take the vaccine. Till Saturday, 6,86,082 people ( 94.01%) had received their first shot, while 2,17,801 (29.84%) had received both the jabs.Though the 18-45 age bracket was the last to be covered under the drive, as many as 3,56,873 people have received the first dose, as compared to 2,57,876 in the 45-plus group.However, the UT health department aims to vaccinate the remaining 43,740 eligible people with the first dose before August 15 to achieve a 100% vaccination target (with the first dose). The health department had also set a target of vaccinating 27,373 healthcare workers, of which 97.44% have received their first dose. As many as 44,660 frontline workers have received the first jab, against a target of 24,396.Chandigarh director health services Dr Amandeep Kang says, “Vaccinating 45,000 people in eight days is an achievable target as the door-to-door vaccination drive is already underway. In most of the UT’s urban and rural areas, health teams are being sent to inoculate the elderly, and those who are bed-ridden or disabled.”“In the coming days, more people will become eligible to get their second jab, which will further check the spread of the virus. However, people still need to wear face masks and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour to avoid getting infected.”Health officials say the first dose of the vaccine helps build antibodies, but without a booster dose the antibodies will not be able to fight off the virus, especially with the emergence of deadlier variants.Dr Kang said UT adviser Dharam Pal has written to the central government asking them to update the eligible population from 15 lakh to 7.2 lakh. “The Centre will soon update the figure and Chandigarh will be first among states and UTs to have inoculated over 94% of its population with the first dose,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/94-population-in-chandigarh-has-received-first-covid-vaccine-jab-101628360768061.html
07-08-2021||Other||BJP minister, MLAs to meet CM for name-change of more dists, towns||Lucknow: A number of BJP leaders, including a minister and legislators, propose to meet chief minister Yogi Adityanath again to press their demands for changing names of districts, cities or towns soon amid exchange of political fire over renaming of Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Awards. Firozabad district panchayat’s resolution demanding renaming of Firozabad district as Chandra Nagar has apparently triggered such demands, with more BJP leaders bringing them into focus ahead of the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. Minister of state for secondary education Gulab Devi proposes to meet Yogi soon to press the demand of renaming her home district Sambhal as Prithviraj Nagar or Kalki Nagar. “Yes, a demand for renaming Sambhal is being raised in different areas in the district. A large number of people came to meet me and I have assured them to convey their demand to chief minister Yogi Adityanath. I propose to meet the chief minister on August 12 and convey the feelings of the people,” said Gulab Devi, who represents Chandausi assembly seat of Sambhal. BJP MLA Devmani Dwivedi said there was a demand to rename Sultanpur. “I have already raised the demand to rename Sultanpur as Kushbhawanpur in the state assembly earlier. This city was founded by Lord Ram’s son Kush. I have requested the chief minister for an early appointment to enable me to place the demand before him,” said Dwivedi who represents Lambhua assembly constituency of Sultanpur. Sultanpur district’s official website also supports Dwivedi’s claims. It reads “The original town was situated on the left bank of the Gomti. It is said to have been founded by Kush, son of Ram, and to have been named after him Kushpur or Kushazbhawanpur. This ancient city has been identified by General Cunnigham with the Kushpur mentioned by Hiuentsang, the Chinese traveller.” Brijesh, BJP MLA from Deoband assembly seat of Saharanpur, said he had consistently raised the demand to rename Deoband as Devvrand. Deoband is known for the seat of Islamic seminary Darul Uloom. He said the place had been referred to as Devvrand in ancient Hindu scriptures. “I will meet the chief minister during the monsoon session of state legislature commencing on August 17. I have met the CM in the past and he has given me an assurance about renaming Deoband,” he said. A demonstration was held in Shahjahanpur on November 20, 2019 to demand its renaming as Shahjipur after name of Bhamashah, a close aide of Maharana Pratap. “I raised the demand before chief minister when he visited Bareilly about a year ago. No further action has been taken,” said Manvendra Singh, BJP MLA from Dadraul assembly constituency of Shahjahanpur. Another BJP MLA from Shahjahanpur Vir Vikram Singh ‘Prince’ said he had raised the demand to rename Khudaganj block of his district. He said the process to rename the block had already begun. “I met chief minister Yogi Adityanath recently and demanded that Khudaganj should be renamed after freedom fighter Thakur Roshan Singh who along with Ram Prasad ‘Bismil’ was hanged for his involvement in the Kakori bank dacoity case,” said Singh, who represents Katra assembly constituency of Shahjahanpur. Renaming of Ghazipur as Gadhipuri has also been demanded, on the ground that it was the capital of Maharishi Vishwamitra’s father king Gadhi in ancient India and renamed after an aide of Mohammad Bin Tughlaq. “We will meet chief minister soon to request change of name. We will also push for change of name of Muhammadabad assembly constituency as Dhara Nagar, as the area is mentioned in ancient scriptures,” said Alka Rai, BJP MLA from Muhammadabad assembly constituency of Ghazipur. A demand to rename Muzaffarnagar as Laxmi Nagar has also been made. “Some people have even begun writing Laxmi Nagar in place of Muzaffarnagar. But nothing concrete has been done,” said Kamesh Tyagi, a farmer from Muzaffarnagar. Kapildev Agarwal, minister of state (independent charge) for vocational education and local MLA refused to comment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s move for changing the name of Rajiv Khel Ratna Awards has evoked mixed reactions. “We can understand change of name of Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Awards after Major Dhayn Chand, as late Rajiv Gandhi was not a sportsperson. This is acceptable. But in other cases, name changes appear to be the outcome of electoral politics and should not be encouraged,” said professor SK Dwivedi, former head of department, political science, Lucknow University. “There should be no politics in sports. If the PM wanted to do something for sports he should have announced more facilities for sportspersons,” said senior Congress leader Pankaj Malik. The BSP has attacked the Samajwadi Party for changing names in the past. BSP chief Mayawati said in a post on social media early this week that the BSP government had made the park in Lucknow that SP named after socialist ideologue Janeshwar Mishra. She said the SP government changed its name like changes made in the name of new districts. Besides renaming Allahabad and Faizabad as Prayagraj and Ayodhya respectively, the state government has indulged in a number of name changes in the past. It recently recommended changing the name of Jhansi railway station after Rani Laxmi Bai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-minister-mlas-to-meet-cm-for-name-change-of-more-dists-towns-101628360526690.html

One scooter and ₹17,000 cash were recovered from them, said police. Police said they had received at least 12 complaints in the last 20 days about people being robbed at gunpoint in Sohna while on their way to and from banks. The suspects -- identified them as Aakash Singh and Sunny of Sohna -- would allegedly target victims who took a route frequented by few people and assaulted those who raised an alarm.Assistant commissioner of police (crime) Preet Pal Sangwan pointed to an incident on July 28 when Delhi resident and bank employee Mohammad Ishtekhar was targeted on the Sohna-Damdama road. Ishtekhar had told police that he was returning with cash he had collected from two families to be deposited at the Sohna branch of the bank. Near Damdama lake, two men on a motorcycle allegedly waylaid him and snatched his bag. “When I raised an alarm, they started hitting me and fled with my scooter that was later recovered after they had abandoned it some distance away,” he said. Sangwan said the other complaints were similar. “The scooter and motorcycle used in crime had no number plate. They had covered their face with a cloth. They mostly targeted route going towards Khedla village in Sohna as there are multiple isolated spots,” he said. Police said they formed teams and patrolled the area in plain clothes. On Friday evening, the teams saw two men on a scooter taking multiple rounds on the same stretch. Their suspicions aroused, the team tracked them and managed to intercept them.Upon questioning them further police found out that the duo were the ones who had been robbing people for the last four months, said Sangwan. They were booked under sections robbery, snatching and theft. Sangwan said they were produced before the court and taken on one-day police remand on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-members-of-a-gang-held-for-12-robbery-snatching-cases-101628360285372.html

07-08-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: Income, caste verification of 350k families begins||The Gurugram administration has begun the verification of the income and caste documents of almost 350,000 families that had registered for the Haryana government’s Parivar Pehchan Patra, or Family ID card scheme, said an official familiar with the development. At least 14 teams have been formed to cover the families in August in a phased manner, they added. The scheme was introduced in 2019 to create a database of Haryana’s domicile population and link it to over 500 government benefits, including those of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram. In December 2020, the Haryana government issued a gazette notification that made the scheme mandatory to avail any government service in the state, including caste-specific and income-specific services, water and sewer connections, town planning schemes, arms licence, tenant and domestic help verification, among others.“Verification is the second stage of the process. The teams first spoke to them over telephone and will now visit them in-person to cross-check their documents. Social workers, volunteers and students have been deployed to conduct the verification,” said a senior district administration official who preferred not to be named. The state administration first collected the details of government employees and then reached out to Below Poverty Line (BPL) population who are already availing many of these benefits. In the first phase of the verification process, around 21,000 families will be covered within a week, while the rest will be covered in the second phase, said the official quoted above. The official added that the family ID cards will be first be issued to 100,000 BPL families. Earlier this week, the Gurugram deputy commissioner had directed officials to finish the verification of about 21, 285 families by the end of the week. According to government estimates, about 450,000 are expected to qualify for the scheme. But the district administration has been facing problems in reaching out to people living in condominiums and gated societies. “Despite several meetings with the RWAs to hold registration camps within societies, there hasn’t been any fruitful response,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-income-caste-verification-of-350k-families-begins-101628360105407.html

Police identified the deceased man as 60-year-old Kanti Lal. His body was buried deep in the debris, and it took rescue teams over three hours to recover his body.The fire department said six fire tenders reached Nand Nagri’s Block E soon after the Delhi Police informed them about the collapse around 1.30pm on Saturday.Three people — Dhani Ram (65), Anaro Devi (65) and Raj Kumar (64) — were rescued from the wreckage and taken to the nearby Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, where they are being treated for their injuries. Devi was rescued by local residents before the police and fire teams reached the spot.Residents of the area told the rescue team that Lal, who lived in an apartment a few buildings away from the one that collapsed, was still missing. His family told police that Lal would often chat with Dhani Ram and other locals at a designated spot below the building. Around 5.30pm, Lal was pulled out from the debris and rushed to the hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.During the day, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted that he was monitoring the situation through the district administration. “All possible help is being provided for relief and rescue. I myself have been continuously monitoring the incident through the district administration,” he tweeted.The police said they have launched an inquiry into the incident, and are investigating what led to the collapse.Locals have told police that the building was constructed 15-20 years ago. “The construction of buildings in these areas is poor. It was in a dilapidated condition. The morning rains could have led to the collapse,” said an investigating officer. “The house is owned by one Dhani Ram who lived with his family members there. It was a two-storey building with shops in the ground floor. At the time of the collapse, he was inside with the other victims who are his relatives. In all, four people were trapped in the collapse out of which three survived. We are probing what led to the collapse,” said a senior police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/one-dead-three-hurt-after-house-collapses-in-north-east-delhi-101628359986764.html

07-08-2021||Noida||Light rainfall after 3 warm days brings respite to city||The city saw light drizzle on Saturday that brought the maximum temperature down by three degrees over the past 24 hours with weather experts expecting the day time temperatures to remain below the season’s average for a few more days before it starts rising again later next week. The city received 1mm rainfall on Saturday after a span of three days. Officials from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said drizzling might continue till Monday before the “break monsoon” or “weak monsoon” conditions sets in around Tuesday. No major traffic snarls were reported by the traffic police.According to weather analysts, the monsoon trough line, a low pressure line that oscillates north to south and brings rains along with it, is currently passing through parts of Rajasthan and west Madhya Pradesh, creating a low pressure area over Delhi and leading to patchy rainfall. “There are chances that the rainfall in some parts of the city may continue for another two days. The overcast sky and drizzle will keep the mercury levels low. However, the monsoon trough will soon move towards the Himalayan foothills, that will deprive the region of rainfall from August 10 onwards leading to a break monsoon or weak monsoon. The mercury will rise thereafter,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre. On Saturday, the IMD recorded a maximum temperature of 32.3 degrees Celsius in Noida and a minimum of 27.7°C, against 35.6°C and 27°C recorded the previous day.At the Safdarjung monitoring station, considered to be representative of the National Capital Region (NCR), the maximum temperature recorded was 33.2°C, four degrees below the season’s average, and a minimum of 27.3°C. The humidity oscillated between 72 to 94%. “The city may see maximum and minimum temperatures of 33°C and 26°C on Sunday. There are chances of light to moderate rains,” said an IMD official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/light-rainfall-after-3-warm-days-brings-respite-to-city-101628359925299.html
07-08-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad to rope in e-vehicles for waste collection||In order to reduce the dependency on diesel fuel and also cut down operational cost, the Ghaziabad municipal corporation has embarked on a pilot project of roping in e-vehicles for door-to-door collection of solid waste, that will be implemented in wards of the Vasundhara zone within a month. Currently, the city generates about 850 metric tonnes of solid waste daily, which is collected and transported by 579 vehicles, a majority of which run on diesel.The city has 100 residential wards, from where waste is collected from every household on a daily basis.“We have been directed to carry out a pilot project, as part of which we will hire an agency that will bring in e-vehicles for door-to-door waste collection. We have decided that the project will be rolled out in wards of the Vasundhara zone. Currently, we spend around ₹40 crore annually for the operation of the diesel vehicles. We will soon float a request for proposal to select an agency,” said municipal commissioner M S Tanwar. The Vasundhara zone comprise residential areas of Vasundhara, Indirapuram, Vaishali and Kaushambi, among other residential localities. The officials said the selected agency will bring in e-vehicles, deploy their own drivers to run the vehicles and chalk out the route for collection and transportation of solid waste. besides managing the work through a control room. “This model is expected to cut down our cost by almost half and do away with our dependency on diesel, which is a polluting fuel. We have also got the funds sanctioned from the 15th Finance Commission and an escrow account will also be created. We have been directed by the state administration to start the pilot project with 100 e-vehicles. Later, the project can be rolled out in the four other corporation zones,” said Tanwar adding with the help of the initiative, he plans to make the corporation as the first agency to operate fully on e-vehicles. Ghaziabad is one of the 16 non-attainment cities in Uttar Pradesh having high levels of air pollution. Cities are declared non-attainment if over a five-year period, they consistently do not meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM 10 (particulate matter that is 10 microns or less in diameter) or NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) Officials said the decision has been taken to cut down the ‘leakages’ in the operation of the 579 vehicles. In order to cut down its mammoth consumption of diesel, the corporation got GPS devices installed in waste collection vehicles, that has helped bring down the usage of fuel.Officials familiar with the development said the monthly fuel consumption in January, February and March was 4.17 lakh litres, 3.58 lakh litres and 3.73 lakh litres, respectively, which dropped to 2.81 lakh litres, 2.87 lakh litres and 2.85 lakh litres in April, May and June, respectively. Councillor Rajendra Tyagi said that ‘leakage’ in fuel usage has plagued the corporation for long. “The leakages have been plugged ever since the GPS devices were installed. However, the agency must change its working with changing times. Roping in e-vehicles will be nature friendly and also help reduce costs. There will be opposition when e-vehicles come in, but the project must proceed,” he added. Environmentalists said e-vehicles will help reduce pollution and also pave way for bringing in more such vehicles in the city. “If a government agency is taking initiative, it will set an example for other departments too. It will also help the civic body comply with the legal directions regarding phasing out of diesel vehicles. The corporation should initiate the project as early as possible and introduce it in other zones too,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist and a lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-to-rope-in-e-vehicles-for-waste-collection-101628359866648.html

But in GB Nagar, the process is more complicated as it requires coordination of different authority bodies with the district health department. We will soon be holding a meeting with all the three authorities to start drafting the bylaws for the licensing of the tobacco vendors,” said Shweta, who uses a single name.An official from the Noida authority said that the implementation process is underway. “We have provided a list of registered vendors to the district health department. We will work in coordination with them to implement the regulations.”Narendra Bhooshan, CEO of Greater Noida authority, said, “We will be providing full cooperation to the district health department for the implementation of the regulations.”Yeida officials could not be contacted for a comment.The licensing system will regulate the sale of tobacco products in the district, said Shweta. “Regulation of access to tobacco products is vital to protect people from getting addicted to tobacco products. Currently, there is no regulation of tobacco products’ sale. Many vendors flout the guidelines of COTPA,” she said.Binoy Mathew, manager (communications) at the Voluntary Health Association of India said that the body has welcomed the move.“UP will be the first state in the country to implement the tobacco vendors’ licensing rule and it is remarkable step towards tobacco control. The licensing will ensure better implementation of COPTA regulations as there are provisions for fines and revoking of licence in case of violations,” he said.The licensing system was implemented in Lucknow in 2018 after the district’s municipal corporation framed bylaws for the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-three-authorities-yet-to-implement-tobacco-vendors-licensing-policy-101628359745357.html

On Friday afternoon, residents welcomed him with loud applause and dhol beats to celebrate his performance at the Tokyo Olympics,” said Nishith Chaturvedi, a member of the Apartment Owners’s Association.Kumar, a native of Pachauta village in Bulandshahr, has been staying in Arihant Arden housing society in Greater Noida West’s Sector 1 for the past five years with his wife and two children. He landed in India on Thursday night. As he entered the housing society on Friday, there was a queue of people waiting to click selfies with him and congratulate him for putting up the incredible fight at the Olympics. “A felicitation event was held in the club of the society, where residents of the housing complex as well as some of his fans from around the society turned up. A cake-cutting ceremony was also held. All the children were excited to meet Kumar. He gave a motivational speech to all the children and urged them to play a sport all their life, whichever one they like,” said Bharti Jaiswal, another member of the association.On July 29, Kumar entered the quarter finals after beating Jamaica’s Ricardo Brown but sustained injuries on his brow and chin. On August 1, he faced World and Asian champion Bakhodir Jalolov of Uzbekistan with 13 stitches on his face. Though Kumar lost the bout 0-5, his brave performance was commended by all.“I did not imagine that I will be showered with so much love after coming back to India. I am touched by the gesture of the residents of Arihant Arden, who gave me such a grand reception. They made me feel that I have won something even though I didn’t bring a medal,” said Kumar, who is currently in his native hometown--Bulandshahr-- to seek his parents’ blessings.Talking about last Sunday’s match, Kumar, who has been serving the Indian Army as a subedar major since 2008, said, “I was in a dilemma as my wife did not want me to go ahead with the quarter finals because of the stitches on my brow and chin. However on the day of the match, I received a video message from my father and brothers who said in order to make the country proud, I should not back out and should go ahead with the match. Moreover, being from the Indian Army, we have been taught to never quit”. Kumar now has now set his sights on Paris Olympics, that is scheduled to be held in 2024. “I will look back at my performance at the Tokyo Olympics and learn from the mistakes I made. My rigorous training will continue under my coach’s guidance and I hope I can get a medal for the country in the Paris Olympics 2024,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/olympian-satish-kumar-gets-hero-s-welcome-at-his-apartment-in-g-noida-101628359686453.html

07-08-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh may get its official state song soon||Uttar Pradesh may soon get its official “state song” to be sung or played during important functions and in schools, people aware of the matter said. The Yogi Adityanath government that also started the practice of celebrating the state’s foundation day as UP Diwas three years ago on January 24, 2018 is working on various options for the lyrics before the most appropriate composition is adopted as the state song. “The government has decided to designate one of the compositions as the state song very soon and the departments concerned are already working in this regard,” Uttar Pradesh chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari confirmed when contacted. Uttar Pradesh, unlike most other states including Uttarakhand that was carved out of it in November 2000, does not have an official state song of its own.Earlier known as the United Provinces, Uttar Pradesh got its current name through a legislation on January 24, 1950, after two years of acrimonious debates and discussions over around 20 suggestions for the new name such as Aryavarta, Avadh, Bharat Khand, Brahmadesh, Hindustan, Ram Krishna Prant and Uttara Khand. Not only is the state information department believed to be working on some lyrics, but the culture department is also gearing up to enlist public participation in composing songs, the best of which could be designated as the official state song by the government. The state government, according to an official, is all set to organise an online competition for people to pen songs as part of ongoing curtain raiser activities under the Bharat Ka Amrut Mahotsav that PM Narendra Modi launched on March 12 this year and will culminate on August 15, 2023, after India celebrates the 75th anniversary of its Independence on August 15, 2022. “After the week-long activities planned under the Bharat Ka Amrut Mahotsav between August 9 and 16 are over, we will launch a competition for people to compose a state song. We will shortlist the best entries out of which the government may pick the best lyric and designate the same as the official state song,” a culture department official said. Some other states that have an official state song include Andhra Pradesh (Maa Telugu Thalliki-To Our Motherland Telugu), Bihar (Mere Bharat Ke Kanth Haar-the Garland of My India), Gujarat (Jai Jai Garavi Gujarat-Victory to Proud Gujarat) and Madhya Pradesh (Mera Madhya Pradesh-My Madhya Pradesh). Some other states have unofficial but traditional and popular state songs played out on different occasions. “A state song instills a sense of pride in people about their state exactly as playing of the national anthem infuses a sense of patriotism in people and makes them proud of their country but it is surprising that Uttar Pradesh has not been able to have its official song yet,” the official observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-may-get-its-official-state-song-soon-101628358065843.html

Earlier, higher education minister Uday Samant clarified that no state universities or colleges will conduct the common entrance test (CET) for admission to undergraduate courses although some autonomous colleges are willing to hold the examination in view of the higher Class 12 scores this year. It is learned that this year, the state board Class 12 pass percentage is 7% higher than what it was last year for the Pune division.On the subject of admission to undergraduate courses, Ravindrasinh Pardeshi, principal, Fergusson college, said that admission to the BA, BSc courses will be based on merit. “We will be considering the Class 12 scores for admissions to first year courses in arts and science. Even though our cut-off is high, it is expected to further increase marginally. The students can submit their admission forms by August 17. We will display the first merit list by August 21 and admission will begin subsequently,” Pardeshi said.Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal, Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce, Shivajinagar, said that the merit list will be based on Class 12 scores. “We are putting together a merit list for students based on Class 12 marks. Students will need to fill the form and get the admission. We have not organised entrance tests as they will take a lot of time and delay admissions. With the merit list process, we intend to begin college by September 1 for first year students,” Zunjarrao said, adding that 200 students will be counselled for 100 seats. “This way, we can complete admissions soon and start the academic year. Our intention is to start the academic year soon so that the syllabus is covered in due time,” Zunjarrao said.In a similar vein, Savita Datar, principal-in-charge, Sir Parshurambhau (SP) College, said that admission will be based on the merit list. “As per the University Grants Commission (UGC) guidelines, the academic session must start before October 1. Going by our preparation, we will be able to start the academic year for first year students from September 1. We are carrying out admissions based on the Class 12 merit list,” Datar said.With the high demand for admission to first year courses however, some colleges such as the Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce (BMCC), which is an autonomous college, have decided to conduct entrance tests for some courses. Seema Purohit, principal, BMCC, said, “We have an entrance test for the Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) course. We already have a mechanism in place and will be conducting an exam for admission to the first year. We are hoping to start the new academic year from September 1.”As per the information shared by the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE), the pass percentage for Class 12 for the Pune district is 99.72%; that for the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) is 99.86%; Pune city east is 99.81%; and Pune city west is 99.79%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punes-top-colleges-to-admit-students-based-on-class-12-scores-101628356445087.html

As of now, Pune city has vaccinated about 58% of its eligible beneficiaries and 21% are fully vaccinated. Estimating that the city’s population is close to five million, of which 3.2 million beneficiaries are aged above 18 and eligible for the vaccine. We have administered 2.5 million vaccines until now, however, this does not mean that all the vaccines are administered to Pune residents as the online system allows residents from nearby villages, or even PCMC, to get a slot at a city hospital.”Even as residents and public representatives push the state government to relax Covid restrictions in Pune city, experts believe that the danger of the much-anticipated third wave will stay until at least 70% of the population is fully vaccinated. However, the city continues to see a shortage of vaccines. On Saturday, the city received 14,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses, against its capacity to vaccinate at least 1,900 beneficiaries daily. This means that 50 centres would not get any vaccines. This new lot of vaccines has arrived after a lull of four days, said officials. PMC has administered a total of 2,544,153 vaccines, of which, 58.43%, or 1,870,069 are first shots. A total of 674,084 are fully vaccinated having received both the doses which accounts for 21.96% of the estimated population of beneficiaries. The PMC has 190 centres for vaccination and if each centre gets 100 doses, then a minimum of 1,900 beneficiaries can be vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/21-fully-vaccinated-in-pune-pmc-immunisation-officer-101628356386859.html

Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said chief secretary Sitaram Kunte is in favour of considering Pune district as three administrative units - Pune Municipal Corporation, PCMC, and Pune rural, when looking at the Covid indicators “According to the chief secretary, instead of considering Pune district as a single unit, Pune city can be considered separately, as the positivity rate and case growth rate in the city low. So if recommendations of relaxations are made then, it would be considered and CM and deputy CM will take a final call,” said Tope in Jalna, while speaking to reporters. The health minister reiterated that curbs could be eased in Pune city if the local authorities recommend so. Meanwhile, traders are expecting a definitive decision at the Covid review meeting to be held on Sunday, which will be chaired by Pune guardian minister Ajit Pawar. Earlier, the Pune administration had also said that the recommendations for relaxations in PMC and PCMC would be presented at the Covid review. Following this, traders and other business operators in Pune have set their eyes on a decision to be taken on Sunday. “Time and again we have made our problem clear to the administration. As we were left with no option we had to opt to defy the 4pm deadline. We are hoping that at Sunday’s meeting a concrete decision would be declared by the guardian minister. If not, then we will continue to keep our shops open till 7pm next week as well,” said Fatechand Ranka, president, Pune trader’s association.

Officials said that the two accused allegedly duped people to the tune of more than ₹2 crore each on the pretext of giving them lucrative monthly returns on investment in their car taxi company.“The company officials told investors that their taxis would be engaged by the government for its officials on a contract basis and all investors would get a lucrative monthly return,” Ankur Aggarwal, Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central Noida) told the media. “However, the fraud came to light when the investors did not get the assured returns. It was later found that the contract of taxi service shown by them to the investors was forged as well,” Aggarwal said further.The officer added that a complaint of fraud was filed at the Phase 3 police station in Noida, and the case was pursued, resulting in the arrests of Vipin Tomar and Deepak Chaudhary.

But in view of the increasing infections of Covid in different countries and many states of the country, we still have to be vigilant and follow the Covid guidelines continuously,” Gehlot's tweet, roughly translated from Hindi, read.Gehlot on Saturday was reviewing Rajasthan’s Covid-19 situation and the vaccination campaign against the viral disease. Gehlot quoted medical experts who expressed fears that the effect of the third wave of the pandemic might be seen in the coming months due to the situation in different states and countries, according to news agency PTI. He added that all related departments in the state, including health, should make sure that they have proper arrangements to deal with any crisis.The Rajasthan chief minister also instructed that the committee of ministers, constituted with regard to the reopening of educational institutions in the state, should take appropriate decisions in view of the Covid-19 crisis in other states. Gehlot said that the committee should take into consideration the experiences of other states which have allowed educational institutions to reopen.In July, state education minister Govind Singh Dotasra announced that schools and educational institutions in Rajasthan would reopen from August 2. However, he later tweeted, “Chief minister Gehlot will decide on the opening of the schools after discussing all aspects with the cabinet committee constituted to prepare the detailed SOP.”People familiar with the matter told PTI that Gehlot questioned the education minister over this announcement of the date for reopening schools even when no decision was taken about it during the cabinet meeting on July 22.Rajasthan on Saturday recorded 19 more cases of the coronavirus disease while no fresh deaths were reported. The state’s death toll stands at 8,954. Nearly 945,000 patients have recovered so far from Covid-19 and active cases stand at 237.

Pradeep Yadav, five-term legislator from Poraiyahat in Santhal Parganas, who joined the Congress after the 2019 assembly polls following a split in JVM(P), met chief minister Hemant Soren on Saturday and urged him to include Bhojpuri and Angika in the list of regional languages notified by the JSSC as mandatory papers. “While the new policy would be of immense help in providing job to the locals, a section of youth could be left out as Bhojpuri and Angika are spoken by a big population even in the urban areas of Santhal Pargans,” said Yadav. Yadav, a former minister, also urged the government to increase the reservation for other backward classes (OBC) to 27 per cent, which was a promise made by the alliance of JMM, Congress and RJD in the last assembly polls during which the combine came to power. Yadav’s demand comes a day after water resources minister and JJM general secretary Mithilesh Thakur made a similar pitch for Bhojpuri and Magahi. The state cabinet on Thursday cleared proposals amending the employment eligibility and syllabus for the examinations conducted by the Jharkhand Staff Selection Commission (JSSC) for grade III and IV government jobs.While the new policy replaces the two-stage examination conducted by the JSSC till now with a one examination, it also made it mandatory that anyone who does not belong to the reserved categories notified in the state would have to have mandatorily passed class Xth and XIIth from a school within the state in order to apply for a job offered by the JSSC.The new examination pattern makes it mandatory to clear a language paper from a given list of 12 regional languages including tribal languages besides Bangla, Odiya and Urdu. While Hindi and English paper would be qualifying papers, the marks obtained in opted regional language paper would be added up in order to make the merit list.Inner voicesPradeep YadavThe five-term legislator, who joined Congress after 2019 assembly polls, met CM Soren and urged him to include Bhojpuri and Angika in the list of regional languages notified by the JSSC as mandatory papers.Mithilesh Thakur On Friday, water resources minister and ruling JJM’s general secretary made a similar pitch for Bhojpuri and Magahi to be included in the regional languages notified by the JSSC as mandatory papers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jkhands-new-employment-policy-chorus-to-expand-list-of-regional-languages-grows-louder-101628353265964.html

On Saturday, the river jumped the danger level at Gandhi Ghat and Digha in Patna by 68 cm and 2 cm respectively, while it was flowing 56 cm and 44 cm above the danger level at Hathidah and Kahalgaon, respectively. “As the water level in the river is rising about two cm per hour, floodwaters from the river may engulf more localities in the next 24 hours,” said a senior official of the water resources department (WRD). The Panchane river level is also rising and wreaking havoc in many flood-prone areas of Nalanda, forcing people of dozens of panchayats to evacuate and relocate to safer places. Intermittent rains in Jharkhand and in the catchment areas of Punpun and Dardha have led to the flooding of a vast stretch of south Patna region. Residents of hundreds of villagers of north Bihar regions, including those of East and West Champaran, Madhubani, Sitamarhi and Saran have been compelled to reside on the roads due to the floods caused by Gandak, Burhi Gandak, Bagmati and Kosi. Besides the general scarcity of potable water and eatables, those displaced due to floods were having tough time arranging fodder for the cattle. “It’s almost a week since we have been waiting for the relief from the government. Officials come, but only with assurance,” said Ram Balak Rajak, a native of Sonbarsa village of Sitamarhi. Chief minister Nitish Kumar has carried aerial survey and road tour to flood-affected areas over the past few weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/rising-ganga-inundates-areas-in-patna-begusarai-and-bhagalpur-101628353085788.html
07-08-2021||Patna||Govt weighs in with test scales to rein in errant shopkeepers||In an effort to protect consumer rights, Bihar’s agriculture department has launched an online process of receiving complaints against unscrupulous shopkeepers who tamper with weighing scales and would be installing test weighing scales in various locations in the state capital in a phased manner, a top official said.Under the initiative, test weighing scales would be installed at all major market places, parks and government offices where consumers having bought any weighable commodity ( be it grocery, edible items including fish, mutton and sweets) can weigh them themselves and lodge a complaint online to the department immediately if there is any discrepancy.“We have already put test weighing scales at 421 locations, mostly in block headquarters, across the state. Now, we are working on putting big test weighing scales at different locations in Patna and other major cities in the next few months. This will help consumers who are often cheated with less quantity of purchased items due to manipulation of weighing machines,” said Adesh Titarmare, director, agriculture department.The weights and measures division, entrusted with the responsibility of checking the accuracy of all types of weighing scales and metal weights, comes under the agriculture department.Titarmare said there have been growing complaints of inaccuracy in weighing scales being used by business establishments in Patna and other places.“The consumers can lodge their complaints in our newly launched site maaptaul.bih.nic.in and their complaints would be redressed at the earliest. Till recently, the process of lodging complaints related to inaccurate weights and measurements was a bit tedious,” said Titarmare. He said the grievance lodging system is linked with the right to public grievance redressal system.Officials said the department has also tightened the process of issuing licence and yearly renewal of weighing scales and other equipment used by shopkeepers across the state and weighing kiosks at the state and national highways in a bid to increase revenue and also check tampering. This year, the revenue target by the weights and measures division has been kept at ₹40 crore, by way of grant of new licences, their renewal and penalties collected by errant shopkeepers. All field inspectors have been asked to conduct random inspections of business establishments periodically.“All inspections by field officers would now be monitored through an app so that they do not have enough room to cover up any act of pilferage or manipulation in weight scales by shopkeepers. Once an inspector visits a shop, he has provide feedback about the weighing scale in the app, which is geo-tagged where images would have to be posted online,” said another senior official of agriculture department.The department has already installed weighing scales at the entrance gates of three airports in Patna, Gaya and Darbhanga, where passengers going to board the aircraft can first check the weight of their luggage and offload some items if it’s beyond the permissible limit fixed by air service operators. Usually, air service operators allow each passenger to carry luggage weighing up to 15 kg and levy extra charges per kg for additional luggage.Right measuresWeighty mattersTest weighing scales have already been set up at 421 locations, mostly in block headquarters, across the state and one each at airports in Patna, Darbhanga and Gaya.Complaint a click awayConsumers can lodge their complaints in newly launched site maaptaul.bih.nic.in.

From August 16, schools will function for class 1 onwards with 50% attendance.However, the department is concerned with poor attendance in higher secondary schools. “Some district magistrates have informed that the number of schools opening is negligible in some districts and it is a matter of concern,“ additional chief secretary, department of education, Sanjay Kumar has written to the director, secondary education.Kumar wrote that while the poor attendance of students is a matter of concern, more worrying is the attendance of teachers in many of the higher secondary schools. The secondary and higher secondary schools will have their board exams early next year and sent-up exams in November-December, which leaves them with very little time to prepare.“Poor attendance in schools means that the district Education officers and their junior officials are not monitoring properly,” wrote Kumar, while directing the secondary education director to issue instructions for monitoring of higher secondary schools and making available the attendance status to the directorate. “The directorate should also be informed about the action taken against truant teachers,” he wrote.Later, he said that the truant teachers must mend their ways and discharge their duties. “The government pays them for teaching and if that is not done regularly, the entire purpose is defeated. Strict monitoring will be done,” he added.Director, secondary education, Manoj Kumar immediately complied and shot off letters to the DEOs to monitor schools and furnish attendance details in the prescribed format and action taken against teachers for unauthorised absence.State project director of the Bihar Education Project Council Srikant Shastri has also written to the DEOs and district programme officers (DPOs) to ensure proper attendance in schools and conduct catch-up courses by teachers to overcome the learning deficit of students due to extended closure of institutions. In this regard, an online meeting will be held on August 11 with all the district officials related to school education to emphasise its importance and work on a plan. Later, DEOs and DPOs will organise offline sensitisation meets with block officials, headmasters and deputy headmasters in small groups.Learning outcome in government schools has been a matter of concern even during normal times, as reflected through the annual state of education reports (ASER) and this may have gotten further affected due to the learning gap because of the pandemic. Bihar education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary had also admitted in the Legislative Assembly earlier that “due to Covid-19 pandemic, education suffered in schools and therefore, bridge course has been planned to cover the gaps, as many students could not have access to online education”.A senior teacher of a school said that it would take some time before the situation normalises. “The number of students coming is very less. The government has issued a lot of directives regarding sanitisation, hygiene and proper facilities in schools, but the ground realities are different. There is a lot of monitoring of teachers by those who have the least interest in education, while the basic facilities remain unattended,” he added.The Patna High Court, while hearing a petition last month, observed that the “education system cannot be improved as it is based on the concept of the segregated system -- one for elite section and other for poor Biharis who have to remain content with mid-day meal, free books, uniform and bicycles with poor teaching or no teaching.” The court sought details of the wards of IAS, IPS and Class-I & class-II officers studying in the government-run elementary and other schools. Following this, the education department started collecting the details. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for later this month..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/covid-impact-poor-attendance-of-students-teachers-in-schools-a-concern-for-bihar-govt-101628352425539.html

During parliament session, the Centre stated that Belgavi, Jalgaon, Kalaburgi, Khajuraho and Lilabari in Assam are likely to have FTOs, for which agreements have been signed between the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and winning bidders.Replying to queries, civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, on August 5, said land revenue has been abolished and land rentals have been significantly rationalized in the FTO policy.The Centre also revealed that aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is planning to increase the frequency of examinations of flying cadets to reduce time for obtaining commercial pilot licence (CPL).“DGCA has modified its regulations to empower flying instructors with the right to authorise flight operations at FTOs. This may help increase flying hours and aircraft utilisation at each FTO and lead to faster completion of the CPL requirements,” Scindia said. “The number of commercial pilots who have completed their flying training in India during the last three years was 415 in 2018, 430 in 2019 and 335 in 2020,” he added.The minister also informed the House that India’s largest flying academy — Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi (IGRUA) at Amethi — has been permitted to carry out pilot training in Gondia in Maharashtra and Kalaburagi in Karnataka to enhance flying hours and aircraft utilisation, which get severely affected during winter due to visibility issues.“IGRUA has been directed to operate on weekends and holidays to enhance its flying hours. Other FTOs are also being encouraged to do so,” Scindia said.Speaking about the impact of Covid-19 on the sector, the Centre said the pandemic has caused job losses in the aviation sector across the globe including India, but according to the airlines in the country, none of their pilots have lost their jobs due to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/india-working-towards-progress-in-flying-training-civil-aviation-minister-jyotiraditya-scindia-101628350385220.html

In a pandemic, correctly filled death certificates can present the real impact of the widespread infection. However, this crucial piece of a document known as the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (MCCD) is often filled incorrectly by medical practitioners. The government and the medical fraternity are now devising ways in which the doctors can be trained in accurately certifying deaths.“Accurate cause of deaths is important to know the disease burden as well as all-cause mortality,” said Dr Avinash Supe, head of the Covid-19 death audit committee. “This data is crucial to prepare healthcare infrastructure and plan targetted interventions. But there is a dire need of training doctors to understand, certify and fill the cause of death correctly,” he said.Cardio-respiratory failure is one of the common causes mentioned on death certificates. Medical experts say that all deaths eventually occur due to a cardio-respiratory failure, but the cause and proper sequence of events have to be accurately noted. For instance, if a patient with severe diabetes has heart failure, the certificate could mention heart failure following a myocardial infarction because of uncontrolled diabetes.In 2016, the state government, civic body and the Tata Memorial Centre collaborated with the Bloomberg Data for Health initiative to develop resources to train the doctors in writing the MCCD. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided technical help on the project and several training sessions were conducted based on the modules that were developed.Taking a leap further, the TMC has launched a digital course on death certification on Friday. The course with 11 different modules will soon be made available in Marathi and Hindi so that doctors on the grassroots can benefit from it.“The primary goal of this digitised education module is to improve the competence of the medical fraternity, be it physicians or students in rural or metro areas to ensure that they are competent in providing a correct, complete and timely cause of death certifications,” said Dr Rajesh Dikshit, Director of Centre for Cancer Epidemiology, TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/need-to-train-doctors-to-certify-fill-cause-of-death-correctly-says-covid-death-audit-panel-101628349545286.html

Recently, the Punjab government had issued orders to pay only 40% of ₹200 crore arrears of educational institutions against the scholarship scheme for 2017-18 to 2019-20. “Total pending grants must be released in one instalment. The government should not dilly-dally over the matter any further,” said Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhina, who chaired the meeting held at Lyallpur Khalsa College, Jalandhar.The committee added that colleges were already facing financial hardship and the non-release of the SC grant had further affected the smooth functioning of these institutions. The meeting also unanimously resolved that the government must withdraw the letter relating nominating its representative to the managing committees of colleges, as it amounted to direct interference into their functioning. They discussed other issues including pending DPI grants, implementing 95% grant-in-aid schemes, instead of 75% for the appointment of teachers in these colleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjabs-aided-colleges-seek-payment-of-dues-for-scheduled-castes-scholarship-101628349305710.html

The civic body will now invest more in dura cylinders and storage tanks for the preparation of the third wave. While five Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plants are in making, one is inaugurated. All other arrangements for the third wave are expected to be ready by August 15. After experiencing immense pressure on oxygen demand during the second wave, NMMC while planning for the third wave had decided to install five PSA plants and one LMO plant. The plan was to have an LMO of 50 metric tonne on a public-private partnership (PPP), wherein NMMC would provide land to a private firm to set up the plant. While half of the oxygen would be used by the municipal hospitals, the rest would be sold to the private hospitals. A consultant was hired to check the feasibility of the project. However, it was found that to have a feasible LMO plant there needs to be a steel plant nearby, which would buy the remaining gas that emerged from the plant. “The private firms who were ready to invest needed a guarantee that the oxygen produced would be purchased by hospitals. But what after the pandemic? We also tried to collaborate with other corporations and install an LMO plant jointly, but even that did not work out. Hence, we decided to focus more on the storage of the LMO instead of manufacturing it,” NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar said. The target is to have 200 dura cylinders with a capacity of 175 cubic metres and storage tanks with a capacity of 90 kilolitre (KL). “We have procured one storage tank of 20KL and the rest too will be done soon. The tenders for the 200 dura cylinders have also been published. We plan to have six PSA with one each at Cidco Exhibition Centre, Vashi and Airoli hospitals of NMMC, Export House, Radhaswami Hall and for the sixth, the location is yet to be finalised. While the one at Vashi hospital has already started functioning, a work order for Airoli and Cidco Exhibition Centre has been done and tenders have been published for Radhaswami Hall and Export House,” deputy municipal commissioner Babasaheb Rajale said. The PSA plant would generate 1.8 metric tonnes of oxygen per day. While the oxygen from PSA is in gaseous form and is 94% pure can be used only for oxygen beds, the oxygen from an LMO which will be now stored in tanks and dura cylinders are 100 % pure and can be used for ventilators. “The dura cylinders are mobile and can be carried anywhere and can also be provided to private hospitals which raise an SOS request many times. For the third wave, 250 ICU beds each are being added to Nerul, Vashi and Airoli hospitals of NMMC besides 600 oxygen beds at GD Pol institute at Kharghar and 500 oxygen beds at Mayuresh building, at CBD, Belapur. The three floors of each hospital would be ready by August 15. “The assembling of transformers is taking time and people are working in two shifts to finish the work. The beds for the ICU will start getting delivered this week. Equipment including 100 ventilators, 100 BiPAPs and 500 monitors have been received and 2000 staff have been trained to handle the ICU,” Bangar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/liquid-medical-oxygen-not-feasible-navi-mumbai-civic-body-focuses-on-storage-of-dura-cylinders-101628348885375.html

07-08-2021||Mumbai||Dr Aasha Goel murder case: 18 years on, trial yet to start||Around 18 years after the murder of Dr Aasha Goel, her family is still awaiting the trial of four accused including one of her brothers and her maternal uncle.Dr Goel, 62, was murdered the Malabar Hill residence of her brother Suresh Agarwal on August 14, 2003. Police had found 21 injuries on her body including a massive head injury, broken jaw, ruptured liver and stab wounds.A murder case was registered with Malabar police station and was later transferred to the Mumbai Police’s crime branch. The crime branch had booked four persons — Narendra Goel, Pradeep Parab, Pawankumar Goenka and Manohar Shinde.Police claimed that the accused took care of properties belonging to the Agarwals and were allegedly paid by one of the brothers. Of the four accused, Parab has been turned an approver in the case.However, since 2006, the case has been stuck in legal tangle. It was only in 2016 that the case came to be committed to the sessions court for trial.While talking to HT, Goel’s son Sanjay and daughter Rashmi expressed disappointment at the way the case was being dragged for so many years. “It’s very frustrating. These accused follow a pattern whereby they file frivolous application one after the other which takes lot of time of the court and the case gets stuck,” said Rashmi, 53, professor of law at the University of Denver.Recently when the case was scheduled for trial, the accused filed applications for production of various documents which included copies of remand applications submitted by crime branch in 2003 while seeking custody of the accused, narco analysis report of the accused conducted at Bengaluru, lie detection report of accused conducted at Gujarat, copy of passport of Shekhar Agrawal (one of Goel’s brothers), insurance policy, insurance claim letter, correspondence regarding insurance payment of Goel.The sessions court, after hearing the plea, denied supplying several documents to the accused as they are irrelevant to the case. The prosecution, however, has been asked to supply copies of narco analysis test Report and lie detector test report of accused.“The sessions court has been asked to expedite the trial, but things just get delayed. Our concerns now, with the challenges that Covid brings, are availability of witnesses and medical evidence; especially when there is restriction on travel for people residing out of India. How will my father, who is 84, depose,” Rashmi said.Sanjay, Goel’s elder son who works with travel industry, said he has been to India for more than 80 times and met senior officials to discuss the case. “We just want justice. I was there with my mother when she visited India in 2003. She wanted to meet her brother who was unwell, and it was rakhi time. She was so worried about her brothers. But look what they did to her,” Sanjay said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dr-aasha-goel-murder-case-18-years-on-trial-yet-to-start-101628344684916.html

How much will help will it provide? When will you repair the bridges that have been damaged, and when will you provide houses to those who have been rendered homeless due to the deluge?” Nath asked the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) regime after conducting an aerial survey of the flood-affected areas in Sheopur and visiting some other districts.The senior Congress leader also accused the state government of only making a slew of announcements. “This is not the time to play politics. We are extending help, the Congress will continue to help,” Nath, who was interacting with the media, said.Nath, who also heads the state Congress unit, further said, “I saw that 80% of the people were on their rooftops. Land and crops have suffered enormous damage due to the flood. The situation is “unprecedented” in the Gwalior and Chambal divisions."Earlier in the day, CM Chouhan claimed 8832 people have been rescued from flood-affected areas, while 29,280 people have been shifted to safer places.According to government data, 1250 villages in north Madhya Pradesh have been affected by the deluge following heavy rains in the central state earlier this week.

I have bookings for next year but it’s a very tough phase at present. This is the time that we can make maximum independent songs and release them so that we have a good playlist of original songs ready when the live shows restart. Probably, this way we can creatively utilise our time,” says the singer.The singer-composer has come up with a new song. “My latest song Ishq Nibhava is sad-romantic number which tells how people struggle in the distance relationship featuring Shakti Arora and Divya Agarwal. It’s a duet with singer Rupali Jagga (hails from Saharanpur). The lyrics have been done by my younger brother Nitish ‘Mannu’ and we both have co-composed it,” he says.‘Gupta, 30, was born and brought up in Dehradun, but has been in Mumbai for a decade.“I did my engineering and then did LLB. So, after studies I joined the corporate world which helped me sustain in Mumbai and shows kept me creatively involved with music. Till date, I have done over 500 live shows,” he says.His first single was followed by SMZA, the film that was extensively shot in Lucknow and featured actor Rajkummar Rao. “My second song was Parindey for film P Se Pyaar, F se Faraar that featured Jimmy Sheirgill. It was followed by single Mera Baalam that featured Rohan Mehra and now this song. My forthcoming song is in collaboration with Punjabi singer Deep Money,” he says.The singer feels that the two brothers into music is a win-win situation for both of them. “We both are into music and best part is I am into singing and he is a writer. We both compose and together we make a great team.

A decision will be taken for local train passengers as well. We need to ensure that these relaxations do not trigger another wave of Covid-19,” Thackeray said while addressing a function organised by BEST, according to news agency PTI.The Maha-Vikas Aghadi government on August 2 eased Covid-19 restrictions in 25 districts of Maharashtra, including the capital Mumbai, where the rate of infection is lower than the state average. Some of these relaxations include allowing essential and non-essential shops to stay open till 8pm and permitting hotels and restaurants to function with 50 per cent of their seating capacity till 4pm. Gyms, spas, yoga centres and salons can now remain open till 8pm with 50 per cent of their capacity and government and private offices can function with full attendance.There has also been a constant demand for allowing fully vaccinated people to travel on local trains, which is one of the most crucial modes of public transportation in Mumbai.Thackeray also said that he had met with the representatives of hotels and restaurants, who have demanded relaxation in operation timings beyond 4pm, and that he explained to them curbs will be relaxed step by step.There are 11 districts in Maharashtra, including Pune, Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli, Solapur, Ratnagiri, where no relaxations have been given as per the August 2 order, since their Covid-19 positivity rate is greater than the state’s average.There has been growing resentment among shopkeepers and owners of restaurants and hotels of these 11 districts over the continuing restrictions. On Thursday, Thackeray urged such people to exercise restraint. “Like we have given relaxation for shops and establishments, other districts will also get them. But we will keep our responsibilities [towards people] in mind and then provide relaxation,” he said.Maharashtra has so far recorded 6,341,759 cases due to the coronavirus disease of which 133,717 patients have died and 6,130,137 have recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/planning-to-relax-more-curbs-call-on-local-train-travel-soon-maharashtra-cm-101628340127264.html

07-08-2021||Delhi||National Handloom Day: Threads of culture that bind these ambassadors to India||It’s no secret that Indian handlooms have piqued the interest of the world since time immemorial. And on National Handloom Day (August 7), the German ambassador to India Walter J Lindner, and his Polish counterpart Adam Burakowski and wife Agnieszka, tell us how they got attracted to the simplicity and vibrancy of Indian handlooms long back. Be it intricately woven shawls or comfy cotton kurtas, Indian handlooms have found a cosy place in their closets, and are there to stay for a lifetime. Excerpts from two candid tête-à-têtes... Garman ambassador Walter J Lindner: In a suit and tie, all men look the same Walter J Lindner is an artistic soul trapped in a diplomat’s body, which is often adorned by Indian clothes. And he reveals that his affair with Indian handloom began much before he came to India. “In 1971, there was a famous concert when Bangladesh had parted from India, faced a flood and a lot of pain. So that solidarity concert in New York’s Madison Square Garden was organised to bring together western and Indian musicians like Ravi Shankar and The Beatles. So here there were Eric Clapton on The Beatles’ side and George Harrison; they were usual hippie type, long hair, jeans, don’t care about what they are wearing. And on the other side, Indian musicians were in kurtas. This was the first time I saw kurtas. The whole appearance was outwardly. I saw this as a young boy of 15 years and I was like: I have to come to this country!”Coming from a place of greys and blacks, Lindner says that for him it’s all about adding that “one piece of colour” to his otherwise simple dressing style. “I usually wear one colour, black or white or blue. And if you don’t add a piece of colour, it’s a bit boring to the eye. If I was in northern Germany where it’s raining and grey, (it’s still okay...but) here where there are colours, I always add an element of colour. You could wear a tie but I don’t wear a tie, so I take a shawl,” he says revealing that he has about 20 shawls in his wardrobe at present. “When I am travelling, I try to find a shawl of any other place (than Delhi). I have a few shawls, but I’m running out of them, I will have to buy some more,” he says making a mental note for shopping!In fact, he admits sporting Nehru suits much before he took up posting in India. “When I was in Germany, and was the foreign secretary, I was known for not wearing ties but Nehru shirts with Nehru collar and Nehru suits. I have two colours, simple black and blue. I don’t wear pink and yellow. I just like the classic, no-nonsense style, which is classy and cool. It has to have something that reminds me of India and ethnic fabrics like cotton. In a suit and a tie, everyone looks the same from China to Africa; men look all the same. In India it’s different. You go to Rajasthan, you have these fantasy suits. I don’t go overboard with it, but I like this menswear over western,” says he, whose love for elephants is immense. “I bought this stole from my recent trip to Mathura, where I walked with the elephants to the Yamuna” he says pointing to the off white piece of cloth around his neck that has black elephant motifs. Lindner has even tried to incorporate the Nehru suit in his official dressing style. “In my profession as a diplomat, the uniform dress is a suit and tie. It took some time to break out of it. I started a few years ago. Okay, you cannot wear jeans! You can wear Indian suit which is a Nehru suit which is elegant and formal,” he says, adding, “In the beginning people were asking what is that for, but then people knew. I did interviews and told people. Now when I wear a tie, they would be astonished, and say: What’s wrong with you!” he laughs.Polish ambassador Adam Burakowski: We visit local markets and artisans to buy from them Adam Burakowski’s dedication to Hindi language is as intense as his wife Agnieszka’s admiration for Hindi cinema’s superstar Amitabh Bachchan. Agnieszka recalls how her welcome to a country drenched in colours as “a shock, in a positive way”, and emphasises that “It’s so colourful in India that now when I go back to Poland, it shocks me how different these two countries are... In the beginning, I was a bit hesitant to wear so much colour. For the official part of our lives, we of course stick to European standards,” she says. But talk of Indian weddings and her face lights up. “I was once wearing a kurta that was too much bling for me. Soon, we realised that nothing is too much at Indian weddings,” she says. The ambassador’s memory goes back in time at the mention of Indian handloom. “In 1997, it was the first time I came to India as a 20-year-old tourist, and bought a blue kurta from somewhere in northern India,” says Burakowski. Next year, he took back a bright Kashmiri jacket for his wife. And till date, he collects local handloom as souvenirs. “When we go to a new place, we visit the local markets, artisans and designers, and buy from them. I was recently in Raipur, Chattisgarh and bought a nice kurta. We often go to Kerala with our family and buy a few things like Kerala style shirts,” says Burakowski, and his wife adds how she picks Indian fabrics to get European style attires stitched: “It’s hot in India so I prefer cotton and linen; they are my favourites. I’ve even got European coats stitched from Indian fabrics, which I use when I go back to Poland. I designed them myself, and my friends also ask me to get it for them. Because the quality of the fabric is different, and they really appreciate it.” And even the young ones in the house are fans of Indian clothing. “We have three daughters and one son. One of our daughters who is 9 years old, loves Indian clothes and has readymade saris. She likes bright colours and even European colours in Indian style,” shares Agnieszka. The ambassador adds, “Yellow is the colour we like. There was this film Rang De Basanti, which was translated as Colour Me Yellow, in Poland. We saw that film and liked it. We watch many Indian movies especially during the lockdown... and for my wife’s birthday, I got a poster of the film Don.” Hearing this, Agnieszka’s face lights up again, as she confesses: “I’m eager to meet Amitabh Bachchan!” Authors tweet @HennaRakheja  and @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/national-handloom-day-threads-of-culture-that-bind-these-ambassadors-to-india-101628334366532.html
07-08-2021||Pune||Startup Mantra: Putting logistics into place for quick delivery, minimum product returns||It’s a lead selling point on any direct-to-customer (D2C) platform – delivery time.While mega movers in the space, cue ecommerce behemoths like Amazon and Flipkart, can bust their bottom lines and the bottom lines of sellers on their platforms to ensure, ahem, same-day delivery, for a 800-odd other ecommerce platforms, websites, apps, the numbers do not add up so easily.In India time is more than money. It is, in the words of Anshul Goenka and Prodipto Roy, founders of QuickShift, a technology fulfilment startup, the key to ensuring an order placed online is delivered in “48 hours, max”, across 26,000 pin codes in India. QuickShift is the accelerator for brands in the D2C, B2B and retail space, enhancing scale and penetration and ensuring delivery times have no impact on the finances, which means, ensuring product returns are down to a minimum.It’s a logistical problem, that when, in 2015 Flipkart and Big Basket were aggressively expanding, Anshul Goenka, just back with an MBA from the UK, saw as his “eureka” moment – fulfilment centres on a platform that connects the entire online retail system – from manufacturing to customer, but especially inventory.Logistics is viewed as a cost centre for businesses. With lack of standardised solutions across the supply-chain, last-mile logistics – at the right time and cost – was a big challenge. How do companies reach the end customers? “We started speaking with brands and customers, and slowly started crafting QuickShift,” Goenka says.“When a brand goes online, they have to deal with inventory, customer experience, shipping, technology,. We built QuickShift on the idea that we want to be a one-stop shop for any of these D2C brands or SMBs looking to go online or maybe retail. For end customers also, it was important that they get deliveries faster. Today in India, shipping is fragmented. From a centralised location, the brand ships it to tier 2 or tier 3 cities, it takes about seven days. We have decentralised the way any brands store their inventory around India,” Goenka explains.In the beginning…Goenka has an MBA in marketing and operations from Symbiosis. He went to the Leeds Becket University (UK) and did another MBA in consultancy there. Says Goenka, “In 2015 I returned to India, but never wanted to fit into a 9-to-5 job. I also wanted to work on something meaningful that would impact and build an ecosystem. I conceptualised a couple of ideas, did some brainstorming and that’s when we stumbled upon logistics. At the time, Flipkart and Big Basket were aggressively expanding and they were all new-age companies. When they started expanding, their logistics started becoming a problem. We thought it’s an opportunity there.”Decentralising inventory QuickShift was launched in 2017. Says Goenka, “In the e-commerce sector, players like Amazon and Flipkart are dominating. We have also seen a lot of other brands growing. When we looked at the landscape, there were very few organised players that were providing end-to-end fulfilment or support services to these brands.”QuickShift opened a network of fulfilment centres - one such centre in Pune, a second in Mumbai and later in Bengaluru, Delhi, and Kolkata. “These are all modern-day fulfilment centres built for speed. We have connected all these fulfilment centres through a common technology platform,” he added.‘Quick’ shift from B2C to B2B“Initially we were more into the B2C segment. We thought we will build a tech platform for B2C audience. Later, we saw enterprise customers had more value. We were lucky to get good connects in the space. Through connects and reaching out to decision makers in the industry we got Big Basket as our first client. With good and long-term contractual values, our cash flows got steady,” says Goenka. The ‘convincing’ factorSays co-founder Prodipto Roy: “About a decade back, new brands had new ideas, good products, and money to spend on marketing. But, they were clueless on how to deliver at a time and speed of the customer’s choice. Big players could manage this problem. With the advent of ecommerce, small businesses and new brands could list themselves on the marketplace, but it did not solve the problem of delivering at a time and speed suitable for the end customer. QuickShift answers that question.”“When the brand connects all the ecommerce marketplaces and when the order hits their stores, it gets carried to their nearest fulfilment centre and the order is serviced within one or two days. We have brought down the seven-day delivery time to 24 and 48 hours. Whenever a customer shops on the website of a D2C brand and they see that they are getting the delivery in one or two days, they are more inclined to placing an order. This helps in getting more order volumes for the brands,” Roy adds.QuickShift claims to be among the few players providing warehousing fulfilment services combined with technology and shipping. The platform allows a brand to scale up rapidly. “They just have to focus on their product development, marketing and customer services. Retail has been hit hard due to the pandemic. E-commerce has taken up the space and with Covid we have seen the pace accelerating,” Roy adds.Addressing the ‘return’ problemBrands suffer heavily from product returns. In India, the return rate is around 25 to 30 per cent, which is very high for a brand, because there is a forward and reverse cost involved. Says Prodipto Roy, “Customers want transparency. They are comfortable shopping on known marketplaces as they are aware of the return policies. If you are a new brand, the customer might not have the conviction to buy the product from your website. We have created tools to encourage the customer to take the order and not to return it. For clients working with us, the return rate is about 7-10 per cent. We give transparency to these customers by giving them step-by-step notifications on Whatsapp. In case of missed delivery attempts, customer gets an alert of whether they want a reattempt or not. Rate of rejection goes down considerably.”And then, there is AI Explaining artificial intelligence (AI) used on the platform, Goenka said, “Brands have to partner with multiple shipping partners. To deal with each shipping partner is difficult. They are also on not-so-easy to use platforms. Hence, we have also connected all shipping partners on a single platform. With a combination of five-six shipping partners, we cover 29,000 pincodes in the country. Orders get allocated based on time required and cost incurred. The platform automatically decides which shipping partner to use for delivery based on the AI algorithm inputs.”“The algorithm to choose the last-mile-shipping partner is based on the cost and time taken to deliver. All pincodes in India are not mapped by courier partners. A partner can deliver at a particular pincode, but others may not be able to do so. So, we update our active pincode list with our courier partners every day. The AI engine knows which courier partner can serve a particular pincode and at what cost. This data is pre-fed before the client is onboarded,” he added.Revealing their future plans, Goenka said, “The Indian consumption story is growing. We want to be significant player in this market. We will be spending a lot on technology and using a lot of data. Businesses rely on very impactful data pertaining to what is working for them, customers, and demographics. These insights will be developed through our platform. Businesses will know what to sell, where to sell, what price points to sell and how they should target their marketing efforts. We will also help brands to generate demand.”Investor speak“Today, India houses 800 D2C brands which have garnered immense interest from the VC community. While the pandemic brought unprecedented changes, these brands seized the day to grow multi-fold, and with that came the need for enablers in the ecosystem. We believe that the idea that has been put into motion at QuickShift, is perfectly poised to capitalise on this opportunity that is expected to be worth over $100 bn in the next 3-4 years.”-Ashvin Chadha, co-founder, Anicut Angel Fund“The new wave of D2C brands has increased consumer choices, with rising demand from all corners of the country. While existing marketplaces have allowed brands to build top-lines, they have often struggled with demand fulfilment. They fall short on consistent consumer experience, managing inventory, and scaling geographical distribution. Quickshift’s vision is to solve this. Their fulfilment platform enables brands to build distribution, own consumer experience, outsource fulfilment and focus on growth. At Axilor, we continue to back disruptors and are delighted to partner with Quickshift, which is well on its way to market leadership.”-Nandan Venkatachalam, principal, Axilor Ventures||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-putting-logistics-into-place-for-quick-delivery-minimum-product-returns-101628332807407.html
07-08-2021||Kolkata||Pay 50% of due school fees or students will be expelled: Calcutta HC to parents||The Calcutta High Court has directed parents to pay at least 50 per cent of their children's outstanding school fee within three weeks, failing which it will mull over allowing educational institutions to take action, including expelling students.The court also said on Friday that a direction regarding students, who appeared for the Class 10 and 12 board exams and cleared them, must be made to respective boards to “suspend their qualification and certificates till the school fees are paid.”The direction came after a division bench comprising justice IP Mukherji and justice Moushumi Bhattacharya expressed displeasure over a section of “financially stable parents” allegedly taking advantage of the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The bench also asked schools coming under the ambit of this public interest litigation (PIL) to send each defaulting guardian a notice within a week citing the due fees to date from March last year.The court will consider allowing schools to keep students from attending online as well as physical classes or even “remove [their names] from the roll of the school without further notice,” should a default emerge during the matter’s next hearing, the bench noted."We are sad and annoyed to know that although the economic situation is much better now than in 2020 and that most persons have learnt how to adjust their lives to the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic, quite a significant number of parents and guardians of the students of various schools and other teaching institutions have taken advantage of this order by not paying the school fees at all," the court said.The Covid-19 pandemic has caused financial distress to several parents, with many losing jobs and witnessing revenue loss in business, among others, but the high court pointed out that the school authorities are also finding it hard to operate the educational institutions during this unprecedented time.Counsels representing the schools alleged that a section of parents was keeping from paying the fees based on an earlier order of the high court thereby causing difficulties to run the institutions.Notably, the court was hearing a PIL filed by guardians of students of a school in the Purba Medinipur district of West Bengal that called for a reduction in school fees in view of the virus outbreak. The petitioners referred to an earlier order passed by the high court that directed no increase in the school fees during the 2021-22 financial year, and also that “non-essential charges for use of facilities not availed of would not be permissible.”The PIL prayed for the application of that order to all students in all schools for the state for the current financial year.The court, however, stated that if all education institutions are taken into account pertaining to the matter, the total amount of outstanding fees come down to several crores of rupees.The bench added that some defaulting parents are “government servants who have suffered no loss of pay during this pandemic.” It said that a “substantial number of parents and guardians” have the capability to pay the school fees but are “deliberately not paying the dues.”Noting that schools are finding it difficult to maintain themselves, there is a need to balance between the needs of the schools against the students’ needs. "The innocent students, we feel, should not be made to suffer for their errant parents and guardians," the bench stated.The next hearing in the matter will be on September 2.Meanwhile, West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) Mamata Banerjee said on Thursday that her government has been considering reopening schools and colleges in the state on alternate days following the end of the Durga Puja vacation in November. “However, nothing has been finalised yet,” she told reporters during a meeting of Global Advisory Board (GAB), headed by Nobel laureate Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee, at the state secretariat, Nabanna.Also Read | Covid: Mamata says Bengal may reopen schools, colleges after Durga Puja vacationEducational institutions in West Bengal have been shut since March this year due to the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/pay-50-of-due-school-fees-or-students-will-be-expelled-calcutta-hc-to-parents-101628331880871.html
07-08-2021||Patna||Fatigue, weakness most common post-Covid complaint received by AIIMS Patna||A 27-year-old software engineer was hospitalised at Patna’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on July 15 after he complained of blackouts, weakness and dizziness while attending to normal chores at home, for several days after his discharge from a hospital in Bengaluru after recovering from Covid-19 earlier.He was advised to visit the institute for a physical check up after consulting doctors at the physical medicine and rehabilitation (PMR) department.A detailed examination revealed that the young man’s oxygen saturation level (SPO2) would dip to below the threshold level of 93 even during normal activities such as walking inside the house. Sensing that he may require oxygen therapy, along with pulmonary rehabilitation exercises for improving oxygenation in lungs, the doctors advised him admission.Another 42-year-old lecturer in a polytechnic college of Bihar, having recovered from Covid-19, came to the AIIMS with almost identical symptoms of fatigue and dizziness while doing routine activities such as bathing. Evaluation revealed his oxygen saturation would drop suddenly to as low as 84 while doing normal activities, making him feel exhausted quickly. He, too, was advised hospitalisation for protocol-based rehabilitation exercises and oxygen therapy, if required, to help replace the fibrous tissues in the lungs with healthy ones.The patient was discharged within six days and is now recuperating well with regular follow-up with doctors from home.Another 72-year-old woman from Darbhanga, who recovered from Covid-19, also had to be re-admitted at AIIMS-Patna for rehabilitation exercises, after she complained of fatigue, vertigo and blackout.The Hindustan Times has withheld the identity of all such patients on request.Tiredness, dizziness, prostration and weakness have emerged as the most common sequel-- a consequence of a previous disease or injury-- of coronavirus, said Dr Sanjay Kumar Pandey, additional professor and head, department of PMR, AIIMS.Nearly two-third of post-Covid patients coming to the institute complained of tiredness and weakness, with sudden fall in oxygen saturation (SPO2) level. This prompted the institute to set up a special post-Covid rehabilitation wing under its PMR department in May. Nine patients with post-Covid complications have so far been discharged after admission at the PMR between July 7 and 27. Scores of others have availed of the tele-consultation and online guidance facilities.“We told Covid patients that they may seek expert advice in case of post-Covid complications by either filling up the Google form on our website or by calling our helpline desk at 9546992688. We get around 3-4 calls every day. Out of the 206 responses we received till Friday morning, 71 approached us offline. As many as 37 respondents had undergone Covid-19 treatment at our institute, while most others were under home isolation,” said Dr Pandey.“In most cases we found there was de-conditioning of the body, especially in the case of Covid-19 patients who were hospitalised for a long duration. Lying on the hospital bed had made their muscles weak. As a result, many complained of weakness in legs, accompanied by weakness and dizziness while standing, walking or going to the washroom. We advised rehabilitation exercises at home in most cases, but advised hospitalisation in case of nine patients whose oxygen saturation level still fell below the threshold limit while doing normal activity,” added Dr Pandey.With pulmonary and rehabilitation exercises, it could take up to four to six months for a patient to get back to the pre-disease activity level, he said.As many as 43% people complained of anxiety, 36% chest congestion and 32.6% low mood. Some other common post-Covid conditions were headache, loss of weight, hair fall, lack of sleep, difficulty in breathing, talking and swallowing.Daily new infections have now come down to double-digit in the state since July 15. With 55 new Covid-19 cases reported on Friday, the state’s total tally went up to 7,25,122 with 9,646 deaths so far. Bihar’s recovery rate was 98.62%, with active cases coming down to 356.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/fatigue-weakness-most-common-post-covid-complaint-received-by-aiims-patna-101628330644509.html

07-08-2021||Lucknow||JP Nadda talks about 'small-minded people in politics', hits out at ‘BJP vaccine’ remark||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president Jagat Prakash Nadda on Saturday hit out at the opposition for casting doubt over the Covid-19 vaccines manufactured in India. “Modiji [Prime Minister Narendra Modi] gave India two vaccines within nine months but they said we won’t get vaccinated because it’s the BJP’s vaccine. This tells us a lot about the politicians' mindset. How will these people who have such a parochial mindset govern Uttar Pradesh,” Nadda, who is on a two-day visit to the state, said.“They are clicking photos after being vaccinated. Should I tell them what medicine is in it?” Nadda said while addressing a meeting of block and zila panchayat heads in the state capital of Lucknow. “We should understand that they are small-minded people in politics,” he said and insisted that the country is not facing any shortage of vaccines.Nadda also hit out at opposition leaders for questioning the government’s decision to roll out the vaccines without conducting clinical trials. “They caused so much damage to the country when they said they were being treated like guinea pigs and questioned why we were vaccinating individuals without conducting the third phase trials, asking if people were sheep and goats,” Nadda said. "Now, I meet these leaders who have gotten vaccinated and I ask them if they think of themselves as sheep and goats."The senior BJP leader was pointing at Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, who said earlier this year that he will not take a “BJP vaccine”. Nadda also hit out at those who criticised the government’s initiatives like encouraging frontline workers by clapping for them. “I ask them what do they know about the meaning of this? If you did your condition in politics wouldn’t be like this,” he remarked.Yadav criticised the government during the first phases of the vaccine dry run that was being conducted in UP. “Why cold-chain and refrigerators for vaccine now? This government was warding off Covid by clanging plates, claps, and hovering helicopters over hospitals,” he asked. Nadda asked BJP leaders and workers to extol the good work done by the Centre and stated that central government schemes have invited praise from people like the UN secretary general. He added that the Prime Minister’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic was also praised by the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO). He also credited PM Modi for ensuring the fair supply of oxygen and criticised the opposition for “quarantining” themselves when the pandemic struck last year and only making appearances on Twitter and virtual press conferences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/jp-nadda-talks-about-small-minded-people-in-politics-hits-out-at-bjp-vaccine-remark-101628329019708.html

07-08-2021||Patna||Experts suggest measures for flood mitigation in Bihar||With Bihar perennially battling floods in one part and drought in the other, experts from Nepal, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Lucknow on Friday suggested different measures, including integrated flood management, intra-state interlinking of rivers, development of wetlands, silt management etc. for resolving the issue at a webinar organised by the water resources department, government of Bihar.AS Maurya from IIT Roorkee discussed the hydrological, topographical and fluvial reasons of floods in Bihar and suggested remedies like silt management by suitable reservoirs and wetlands, structural interventions and non-structural measures. The issue of silt management, especially in the Ganga, has been raised time and again by none other than chief minister Nitish Kumar, but no concrete action has been taken so far.Neera Shreshta Pradhan from International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), Nepal, suggested involving community in flood management and sending them regular warning related to increase or decrease in water level. ICIMOD is a regional intergovernmental learning and knowledge sharing centre, serving member countries of the Hindu Kush Himalayas including India, China, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Bhutan, Pakistan and Afghanistan.Dr RN Sankhua, chief engineer (south), National Water Development Agency, Hyderabad, discussed causes of Bihar flood in detail, including topographical and morphological behaviour of rivers, deforestation, limitations of conventional flood embankments etc., while stressing the need for innovative structural measures like widening of flood plains, flood plain lowering and detention, intra-state interlinking of rivers, creation of more wetlands, room for the river, detention basins and water storage area, alternative to embankments, dredging, etc.Dwelling on integrated flood management, Manoj Chauhan of Egis India Consulting Engineers Pvt Ltd advocated land and water resources development in a river basin with a view to maximising the efficient use of floodplains and minimising loss of life and property.N Dinesh Kumar of Egis India suggested transferring part of the monsoon flood water in north Bihar to less water-rich basins of south Bihar, besides construction of percolation wells to increase the direct recharge of monsoon runoff in river channels.Inaugurating the webinar, Bihar water resource department’s Sanjay Kumar Jha said that CM has always favoured finding long term solutions to contain floods and drought in state. “The department is working on finding long term solutions for water management by inviting suggestions from experts. The chief engineers of the department have also been asked to attend it to understand the viewpoints of experts. The department will later brainstorm to decide which idea to adopt and work on,” he added.Department’s secretary Sanjeev Hans said due to climate change it was likely that the frequency and intensity of flood in Bihar may increase in the days to come. “Under the guidance of the CM, the department has been working on structural, non-structural & green measures for flood mitigation. Given the high population density in the state, we have to look towards scientific solutions for this.” he said, adding the formulation of policies based on scientific research will ensure effective policy development and evaluation processes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/experts-suggest-measures-for-flood-mitigation-in-bihar-101628319963612.html

They later claimed they were checking how alert the Mumbai Police was.After receiving the call at about 9 pm on Friday, the Mumbai Police swung into action and deployed various units like the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad (BDDS) and the Dog Squad to search all the areas mentioned in the call for presence of possible explosives.“We informed all concerned police stations and agencies and carried out a thorough check of these areas,” said a senior police officer.Juhu police, MRA Marg police, Dadar police and Byculla police searched the areas within their respective jurisdictions and found nothing.“Later, we called back the caller but we were told that he was very busy and should not be disturbed. Eventually, he switched off the phone,” said a senior police officer.The Mumbai Police’s crime branch’s Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) later picked up two persons from Kalyan’s ShilPhata area on the basis of their cell phone tower location. They told police that they had been celebrating ‘Gatari’ and were heavily drunk when one of them decided to make the call “for fun”. Gatari is celebrated in Maharashtra and Goa before the beginning of the Hindu month of Shravan. On this day, people generally eat and drink to their heart’s content to make up for the abstinence to be practiced during Shravan.“Both of them are drivers. Raju Kangare, 32, and Ramesh Shirsath, 28, are residents of Dombivli,” said a senior crime branch official.The officer said the two accused claimed to have made the call for fun after getting drunk, and also to check alertness of the police machinery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/inebriated-men-make-hoax-bomb-call-to-test-mumbai-police-s-alertness-arrested-101628315223499.html

The agitators, representing 'Poschimbongo Sikshak Oikyo Manch' – a joint platform of para-teachers – said they wanted to meet Basu and submit their charter of demands to him. The police, however, stopped the teachers from carrying out their demonstration in Lake Town area here, following which they left the spot. "We want to be recognised as full-time teachers, not contractual employees. We also want the government to increase our salaries and provide DA, PF and gratuity benefits," one of the protesters told reporters. The para-teachers, who work on contract in government-run schools, had long been seeking salary hike and the status of ''elementary teacher''. In February, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had announced a three per cent annual pay hike for the contractual teachers, but the proposal, however, failed to quell their protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/parateachers-in-bengal-agitate-outside-education-minister-s-home-seeking-pay-hike-101628313918759.html

In view of the concern regarding the third wave and the fact that such kind of gatherings in confined spaces may become super spreader events, guidelines have been issued for the Shravan Ashtami Navratras,” he said. Police have implemented the No Mask No Darshan policy and are ensuring social distancing by sensitising, educating and legal enforcement. Provisions for thermal screening have been made at the entrance of religious places besides arrangements for hand sanitisation/handwashing.

07-08-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand has 4 psychiatrists for over 10 million population, reveals RTI||Uttarakhand has just four psychiatrists against 28 sanctioned posts in state’s 13 district hospitals to serve a population of over one crore, a government response to a right to information application revealed. Of all the four psychiatrists, three are posted in a Dehradun hospital and one in Nainital; the remaining 11 district hospitals have no psychiatrists.In June 2018, Uttarakhand high court directed the state government to provide “mental healthcare and treatment to all the persons with mental illness at an affordable cost, of good quality, available in sufficient quantity, accessible geographically and without any discrimination”. The HC had also directed the state government to open more mental healthcare establishments ``taking into consideration the large number of persons suffering from mental illness for their proper treatment, protection and care”.“It is shocking that 11 districts do not have even a single psychiatrist. This will make access to mental healthcare difficult in the Himalayan state, where many people need help, especially during this Covid time which has aggravated mental ailments and affected mental healthcare”, Anoop Nautiyal, founder, SDC Foundation, which had filed the RTI, said.Director general health, Uttarakhand, Tripti Bahuguna said efforts are on to improve mental healthcare in the state. “Some MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery) doctors have been trained in basic psychiatry and more MBBS doctors will be trained in such courses to make up for the deficit. Also, State Mental Health Institute at Selaqui in Dehradun, the lone hospital for such patients with a capacity of nearly 40 beds, is being upgraded to 100 beds soon. We are also in the process of recruiting psychiatric doctors on a contractual basis”, she said.The RTI has also revealed that in nine of the 13 districts, availability of specialist doctors is less than 50%, at a time when the country is preparing for the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Haridwar has only 40 specialist doctors against 105 posts.“RTI data shows there is almost a 60% shortage in availability of child specialists and gynaecologists in the state. Accessibility is already a major challenge for women in hilly areas. Unavailability of female doctors will further exacerbate such issues,” said Rishabh Shrivastava, lead research and communications at SDC Foundation.“We have found that a lot of specialist doctors have been deployed for administrative duties. This is completely unacceptable. Right now, we need the services of these doctors more than ever,” said Vidush Pandey, a researcher at SDC Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-has-4-psychiatrists-for-over-10-million-population-reveals-rti-101628307422681.html

07-08-2021||Delhi||Plea in SC against Asthana’s appointment as Delhi top cop||In a first substantial challenge to the appointment of Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police commissioner, a petition before the Supreme Court has claimed that the order to appoint him is illegal and smacks of malafide as it goes contrary to Supreme Court decisions, recruitment rules and provisions governing inter-cadre transfer.On July 27, the Centre issued orders appointing the 1984 Gujarat-cadre IPS officer Rakesh Asthana as Delhi’s top cop for a year, with just four days remaining for his retirement.The petition filed by NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation on Friday said that the July 27 orders issued by the Appointments Committee of Cabinet (ACC) and the Centre appointing Asthana as Commissioner of Delhi Police need to be quashed and a fresh appointment process initiated for choosing an officer from AGMUT cadre for appointment as police commissioner. The AGMUT is a cadre for Arunachal Pradesh, Goa Mizoram and other Union Territories including Delhi.The petition filed through activist lawyer Prashant Bhushan said, “The impugned orders dated July 27 are completely illegal and clearly smack of malafide and have presumably been issued only to promote the interests of the Respondent No.2 (Asthana) as well as of those in the Central government.”Earlier, a contempt petition was filed in the top court by lawyer Manohar Lal Sharma submitting that Asthana’s appointment went contrary to the top court’s March 13, 2019 judgment in the Prakash Singh case requiring any officer appointed as director general of police to have a residual tenure of six months for appointment. Asthana had four days to retire as on July 27.In May, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana alluded to the judgment when candidates, including Asthana, were being considered for the post of director of the Central Bureau of Investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/plea-in-sc-against-asthana-s-appointment-as-delhi-top-cop-101628285651574.html

07-08-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Pintu's vintage collections||Times change, institutions alter. The iconic book bazar that used to unfold every Sunday on Daryaganj footpaths has been moved to the exhibition ground of Mahila Haat. It is very close to the market’s old site, but the experience is profoundly different. In the old bazar, you walked a mile from one stall to another, with books laid out on the pavement. In the new bazar, you move in circles. The space is much smaller, there is less mobility, there are no snack stalls, and the stalls are fewer.Also, some stars of the bazar are missing. Bookseller Surinder Singh for instance, who would sit outside the Broadway Hotel with some of the best selections in novels and poetry, hasn’t opened his stall in Mahila Haat yet.Such absences are sorely felt. But the bazar has a new star.Pintu’s stall has a most incredible collection of paperback classics published by Penguin in the 1950s and 1960s. While the titles might easily be found elsewhere, you won’t get them in such stunning cover designs, which also evoke an earlier era in the book publishing art.“I have 10,000 old Penguins in my godam (warehouse) in Sonia Vihar, but here I bring only a few hundreds,” says Pintu, real name Ashwini Kumar. The stall was founded by his father Jaleshhwar Prasad in 1993 in the old bazar, but it did not stand out then. The stall’s current collection has come from “containers” arriving by sea from the US and UK, and road-transported to Delhi by trucks. That’s the primary way of sourcing books by the bazar traders, apart from scavenging in the city’s private libraries.This afternoon, Pintu’s selection includes all the Signet editions of Shakespeare plays from the 60s. These paperbacks are cherished for their minimalist yet richly detailed camp-style covers. They were the work of the legendary Milton Glaser, the American graphic designer famous for his 1967 poster of Bob Dylan with psychedelic hair and his iconic “I love NY” logo. He died last year. Pintu’s Glaser collection includes a copy of The Tempest, in which Miranda’s luscious ringlets are sprouting a dreamy vapour-like image of her father, Prospero.Now a masked browser picks up a paperback of Jean Genet’s Thief’s Journal, whose cover shows a man’s head etched with images of Greek sculptures. The customer thinks 100 rupees is too much for this priceless copy and goes away. Good for those who will value it truly.Pintu’s stall lies opposite stall 8, in the center of the grounds.

A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh issued notice on a plea by Action Committee Unaided Recognised Private Schools, an umbrella of over 400 private schools, which contended that the Delhi directorate of education has said that in addition to the annual and development charges, a reduction of 15% must also be given on tuition fee.

The victim, Priyanka, is the daughter of migrant labourer from Jharkhand and had been staying on a construction site. She was with her grandmother when she was carried off by the leopard from outside their shanty around 8.30pm, Shimla wildlife divisional forest officer (DFO) Krishan Kumar said. The victim’s grandmother, Sukhmati, said, “I had gone to check on the rice, leaving Priyanka outside when the attack took place. I heard the sound of a bucket falling and saw the animal carry off my granddaughter.” The victim’s mutilated head was found 200 to 250m away from the construction site. Fear-stricken residents immediately raised the alarm and informed the wildlife wing and the police as soon as the girl went missing. A team of wildlife and forest department officials accompanied by locals launched a search for the feline. However, the operation was suspended due to darkness. The victim’s remains have been sent to the forensics department to verify her identity and to determine whether more than one leopard had been involved in the attack, the DFO said, adding that the girl’s family will be given a compensation of ₹4 lakh. Cages and cameras have been set up in the area to trap the big cat, who officials say has become a man-eater. “Teams have been deployed to search for the missing girl and trap the man-eating leopard. Camera traps and cages have been set up to catch the animal,” said Archana Sharma, the principal chief conservator of the Himachal Pradesh forest department.The leopard had been sighted several times in Kanlog, Sanjauli, Khalini, Dhalli, Vikas Nagar and Five Benches areas of Shimla at night. The attack on the five-year-old is not an isolated incident. On June 21, a youngster had been attacked by a leopard outside his house in Krishna Nagar locality, while he was relieving himself. However, the alert man managed to lock the leopard in the bathroom and escaped with minor injuries. Later, the animal was tranqualised and taken away by the forest department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/leopard-mauls-five-year-old-girl-to-death-in-shimla-s-kanlog-101628280360866.html

In a letter, Jammu divisional commissioner Raghav Langer asked deputy commissioners of all the 10 districts of Jammu region –Jammu, Doda, Reasi, Poonch, Rajouri, Kathua, Samba, Ramban, Kishtwar and Udhampur – to identify government schools that can be named after the martyrs. The order said, “As per instruction received by a higher authority, I am directed to request you to kindly identify such government schools in villages and municipal wards of the district that can be named after our martyrs (police/army/CRPF)”. “A committee may be constituted at district level to prepare such details after due verification. Senior superintendent of police, assistant deputy commissioner, assistant commissioner (panchayat), or a representative of the army can be included in the committee to finalise the list at the district level,” said in the letter. Udhampur district commissioner Indu Chib said, “We have identified eight to nine government schools, but we are yet to finalise the list.” A senior army officer, requesting anonymity, said, “It is a wonderful initiative by the government. At least our children would learn about the supreme sacrifices of the martyrs. Not only it will nurture a feeling of nationalism among the citizens, but also immortalise the martyrs, who will be remembered by their names.” In 2019, Rajasthan had also cleared a proposal to rename 15 government schools in different districts of the state after martyrs. The Punjab government has also said that it will rename 14 more schools after freedom fighters and other renowned personalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-schools-in-j-k-to-be-renamed-after-martyrs-101628280064260.html
07-08-2021||Chandigarh||J&K launches film policy to promote UT as shooting destination||Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha has launched the Union Territory’s Film Policy, which officials said has been worked out to facilitate the overall growth of the film industry in the region, including setting up of a film development council and revival of closed cinema halls.The policy, launched at a star-studded event here on Thursday in the presence of actor Aamir Khan and filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani, aims at establishing Jammu and Kashmir as the first choice of film shooting destination for filmmakers.The officials said the policy has been worked out to promote the overall growth of the film industry in the Union Territory, setting up of the Jammu and Kashmir Film Development Council and providing hands on access to website for talent pool and all shooting destinations.They said it will also facilitate the development of shooting locales, infrastructure for film screening, revival of closed cinema halls, upgrading existing cinema halls, encouraging setting up of multiplexes and cinema halls, destination marketing, organising the J&K film festival, and restoration and preservation of films from the region.The government has set up a single-window clearance mechanism, prepared equipment, location and talent directories, besides offering a host of incentives for filmmakers coming to the UT, the officials said.Speaking at the launch event, Sinha said it was a historic day for Jammu and Kashmir. He said the government is creating a vibrant film ecosystem to make the region the film industry’s favourite once again.Among one of the best in the country, the new Film Policy will transform Jammu and Kashmir and revive its halcyon days of being a cinematographer’s delight, he added.“I invite filmmakers from across the world to come to J&K and explore the pristine beauty of Jammu and Kashmir. At the same time, also avail a host of fiscal and non-fiscal incentives, besides world-class facilities offered by the J&K government,” he said.The Film Policy has been drafted after consultations with the experts and in-depth study of progressive film policies of other states, UTs, and other countries. “Suggestions of renowned names of the Indian film industry have also been incorporated while formulating the policy. The facility which one gets at other locations in Europe or America, we are committed to providing the same at the locations in Jammu and Kashmir,” the Lt Governor said.Sinha said the Film Policy is not just a government document, but it is Jammu and Kashmir regaining its proud legacy of association with the world of cinema, and the long and cherished tradition of film shooting.It is also a reflection of a changing development scenario of Jammu and Kashmir and represents the aspirations of the art sector, he said.“To meet the need of the film shooting, we have the manpower of more than 1500 such trained artists which will also provide an opportunity to the local talents to show their skills,” Sinha said. “Besides, there are hundreds of unexplored places, which have been left unattended by filmmakers and we are developing those potential places with the requisite facilities and team of the best local artists.The new film policy will also give a fillip to the film tourism sector, thus opening up more employment avenues for the locals,” he added.“As far as security is concerned, 10.52 lakh tourists coming in July alone shows that there is no concern from the security point of view,” the Lt Governor said.While highlighting some of the key endeavours of the government to add more attraction to the film sector and introducing Jammu and Kashmir’s long association with the films to the new generation, he said the government has decided to install illuminating signages dedicated to the directors, film actors and crew members at the locations where memorable films have been shot.Recalling the era of 60s and 70s, the Lt Governor said renowned films makers and film personalities such as Raj Kapoor, Shammi Kapoor, Rajendra Kumar, Dilip Kumar in the 60s, and later Yash Chopra, Rahul Rawail, Mani Ratnam, had a deep association with Jammu and Kashmir. The world will once again get to see and experience the same scenario after decades, Sinha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jk-launches-film-policy-to-promote-ut-as-shooting-destination-101628279580748.html
07-08-2021||Chandigarh||3 of four govt technical varsities in state don’t have regular V-C||Adhocism has hit hard higher technical institutes with three of the four government universities in Punjab functioning without a regular vice-chancellor (V-C). Maharaja Ranjit Singh Punjab Technical University (MRS PTU), Bathinda, is the only university that is having a regular V-C, whereas the term of Jalandhar-based IK Gujral Punjab Technical University’s V-C Dr Ajay Kumar Sharma had expired in May and he has been asked to continue till the time a replacement is finalised. The two newly-upgraded technical universities — Shaheed Bhagat Singh Technical University at Ferozepur and Sardar Beant Singh Technical University, Gurdaspur — are also functioning without a regular V-C. “Generally, whenever a university is announced or set-up, the first thing the government does is appoint a regular V-C so that he can create the infrastructure on the campus and take other decisions as per the requirement. In the case of these two varsities, the opposite has happened,” a retired registrar of a university said. The charge of Ferozepur varsity is with Dr Buta Singh, the V-C of MRS PTU, Bathinda, whereas the charge of the Gurdaspur varsity is with Guru Nanak Dev University V-C Dr Jaspal Sandhu. In March this year, the Punjab government had given nod to upgrade as universities the two engineering colleges at Ferozepur and Gurdaspur. The three universities having no regular V-C are also not having regular registrars and the additional charges have been given to other officials. The PTU Jalandhar is also running without a regular registrar since 2012. The post of V-Cs for these three universities were advertised in May and the last day to apply was May 25. According to a senior technical department functionary, the selection committee led by Punjab chief secretary had finalised names for the PTU Jalandhar. However, the file regarding the appointment has been moving from one office to another and is yet to reach the governor for the final notification. Technical education minister Charanjit Singh Channi said he was aware of the issue and has been in touch with the officials involved in the selection of the new V-Cs. “As far V-C of PTU Jalandhar is concerned, I was against giving charge to a person whose term has ended. I even got the reports that he is not taking calls and the work of the varsity has come to a stop as he is not taking interest anymore,” said the minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/3-of-four-govt-technical-varsities-in-state-don-t-have-regular-vc-101628279221009.html

He also visited Dera Jaura of Sant Nirmal Dass at Raipur village in the district. He was accompanied by cabinet ministers Charanjit Singh Channi and Aruna Chaudhary; working presidents of party Sukhwinder Singh Danny and Sangat Singh Gilzian; former MP Mohinder Singh Kaypee and over a dozen party MLAs. Sidhu reached Jalandhar in the afternoon and met party MLAs and senior leaders, before they all reached Dera Sachkhand at Ballan village where he met its head Sant Niranjan Dass and also partook of a langar. In his address, Sidhu said he has come to seek their blessings in his endeavour to work for uplifting and empowering the underprivileged sections of society. “I am not here to do any kind of politics. Religion is higher than politics. We should take guidance from the religion,” Sidhu said. Sidhu also visited Dera Jaura of Sant Nirmal Dass at Raipur village. Faces farmers’ protest Farmers staged a protest against Navjot Singh Sidhu near to Dera Ballan on Jalandhar-Pathankot highway even as police kept the protesters at a bay. Farmers said Sidhu was playing politics rather than supporting them on the three farm laws. They said Sidhu has single agenda to somehow let Congress form the government in Punjab in 2022. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Kashmir Singh said Sidhu didn’t visit Singu border where farmers were protesting since November last year. “But, farmers on their own have enough power to force the central government to repeal the laws,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/eye-on-dalit-votes-sidhu-visits-dera-sachkhand-ballan-101628278922065.html
07-08-2021||Chandigarh||Svamitva scheme: Govt extends project to give proprietary rights to villagers||After a drone survey in villages of Gurdaspur district for giving proprietary rights to dwellers inside ‘lal dora’, the Punjab revenue department has decided to take the project to five other districts, namely Fazilka, Bathinda, Barnala, Faridkot and Fatehgarh Sahib. The project is part of Centre’s ‘Survey of Villages for Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Area’ (Svamitva) scheme, called ‘mission lal lakeer’ in the state. Svamitva scheme is a central government scheme that will provide an integrated property validation solution for rural India. This was a long pending demand of the rural dwellers to prepare a detailed inventory of all kinds of properties within the ‘lal lakeer’ and give the ownership rights so that villagers can monetise their immovable assets. Under the pilot project in Gurdaspur, 1,225 villages were to be surveyed. So far, drone survey has been completed in 206 villages and maps of 165 villages have been verified and sent back to Survey of India, the national mapping agency (NMA). Objections have been invited by displaying maps in 12 villages. There are 12,500 villages in the state and all will be covered under the Svamitva scheme. “Already work is at an advanced stage in Gurdaspur and we hope to start issuing property cards to the dwellers within a month,” said additional chief secretary Ravneet Kaur. The Survey of India has been asked to deploy drone teams in five districts in August. In July, Punjab’s rural development and panchayats department had signed a MoU with Survey of India to carry out drone-based mapping of rural habituated areas. “This will also help in resolving property-related disputes, besides enabling creation better panchayat development plans,” said a state government officer, adding that once the inventory is completed, ownership documents will be prepared. Under the scheme, 12 continuously operating reference stations (CORS) have been set up in the state. State revenue department, the nodal agency for ‘mission lal lakeer’, has constituted a state-level steering committee led by the chief secretary, district-level monitoring committees headed by the deputy commissioners and implementation committees led by the sub-divisional magistrates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/svamitva-scheme-govt-extends-project-to-give-proprietary-rights-to-villagers-101628278680785.html

07-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC can impose only 10% interest on delayed rent payment: Estate officer||The court of additional commissioner-cum-estate officer, Chandigarh municipal corporation, on Friday held that the civic body cannot charge its allottees 20% penal interest on account of delayed ground rent payment and can only impose 10% interest. The order came in the case of Lok Priya Buildwell Private Limited, which is the lessee of the hotel site in Sector 35-B from where JW Marriott hotel operates. The EO directed the MC to calculate the outstanding amount of ground rent at 10% as per provisions of the lease rules and intimate the lessee Lok Priya Buildwell Pvt Ltd, hotel site Block no 6, Sector 35B, within seven days. The lessee has also been directed to pay the dues within 30 days from issuance date of the demand notice, failing which the office would be at liberty to initiate action as per the rules applicable in the present case. Notably, the EO order came following the directions dated October 22, 2020, of the court of UT adviser, which had set aside the resumption order issued to the Sector 35 hotel by the estate office branch of the Chandigarh MC. The adviser had directed the EO to examine afresh. The petitioner approached court of EO through advocate by SK Jain and Vikas Jain. The petitioner’s counsel stated that the estate office had wrongly charged 20% interest on account of non-payment of ground rent while applying condition five of the allotment letter and that the said condition applied to non-payment of principal amount of premium and not non-payment of ground rent. The appellant further contended that as per the Rule 13 of Chandigarh Leasehold of Sites and Building Rules, 1973, only 6% interest can be charged for the non-payment of the ground rent and till date it is actually paid. “The Chandigarh MC had not issued any notification for the imposition of interest at 20%, which without any notification is illegal and liable to be set aside,” it was said. The MC representative submitted that it was clearly mentioned in clause five of the allotment letter that in case the petitioner failed to make payment of outstanding dues then he is liable to pay 20% interest on the account of non-payment of ground rent. “The Chandigarh Lease Hold of Sites and Building Rules, 1973, governing the allotment of the site had mentioned 20% penal interest,” it was mentioned. The UT adviser had set aside the impugned orders passed by the lower courts and remanded the case back to the MC additional commissioner for a fresh decision. The adviser order had stated, “It is clear that condition five of the allotment letter providing 20% interest is applicable only to non-payment of the principal amount premium. It is also a fact that there is a separate provision for non-payment of ground rent under the act as well as in the allotment letter. Since the additional commissioner has not applied the relevant rules while passing the impugned orders, therefore, the revision petition deserves to be accepted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-can-impose-only-10-interest-on-delayed-rent-payment-estate-officer-101628277780707.html

AAP state unit chief SS Kaler said Kejriwal was scheduled to travel to Uttarakhand every month “and make a similar announcement on other domains.” “It would include water, education, health and other basic amenities for the public which are necessary for any state. These won’t be mere announcements but our promises that will be fulfilled if AAP wins 2022 elections,” he said.In July the AAP’s state unit launched “Kejriwal Muft Bijli Guarantee Card” under which party’s 10,000 workers are to visit households in all the 70 assembly seats and ask people to register for the free electricity to get the “guarantee card” that the party will deliver on its promise if it comes to power.The BJP and the Congress, however, dismissed the AAP effort to emerge as the third player in state politics.BJP state media in-charge Manveer Singh Chauhan said, “It is the modus operandi of AAP to make false promises which they can’t fulfill. They are doing the same in Uttarakhand too but they won’t succeed as people are here are aware of their despicable tactics.” The state Congress called the AAP’s promises a political gimmick. “They know that they have no political ground in Uttarakhand. Hence making such promises months before the elections to garner some votes. But, the people of Uttarakhand are smart enough to not fall in their trap,” said party state spokesperson Garima Dasauni.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/aaps-kejriwal-likely-to-visit-uttarakhand-on-sunday-say-party-leaders-101628277661813.html

The caller had claimed that the woman had been assaulted. After reaching the spot, police rushed Joginder Kaur to Government Multi Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, where she was declared brought dead. Investigating officials found things scattered in the house, pointing to the possibility of a theft bid. However, police are not ruling out the role of some person known to the elderly woman, who might have tried to pass it off as a theft gone wrong.The kitchen knife used to slit her throat has been recovered. A case has been registered under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code at the police station in Sector 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-97-year-old-woman-found-murdered-in-sector-8-101628277660622.html
07-08-2021||Chandigarh||Rift in Chandigarh Congress: Ex-president Chhabra quits party||After a six-month-long open spat with the incumbent Chandigarh Congress leadership, the party’s former local unit chief Pardeep Chhabra on Friday resigned from its primary membership.The resignation comes a day after the Chandigarh Territorial Congress Committee decided to issue a show-cause notice to Chhabra for his “anti-party” activities. There were strong indications that he would be ousted from the party.Chhabra, in his resignation letter addressed to All India Congress Committee interim president Sonia Gandhi, blamed former Chandigarh MP and party’s national treasurer Pawan Bansal for his resignation.“I was being treated as a puppet who was controlled by Bansal. I had no other option but to take this step, which I hadn’t imagine even in my dreams, because of the dictatorial attitude of Bansal,” he wrote in the letter.Since his removal from the post of the Chandigarh Congress president in February earlier this year, Chhabra has been a vocal critic of the party’s local leadership. Initially, his criticism was directed towards his successor, Subhash Chawla, but in the last couple of weeks, he started questioning Bansal’s role in the local unit’s working.In the resignation letter, Chhabra further wrote: “Bansal has been running the party like a private company. Due to his ego, I was removed from the post of CTCC president without any intimation.” Points to party’s losing streak Claiming the “Congress is dying”, Chhabra stated in the letter that since the 2013 railway scam, involving Bansal’s kin, the party has lost all elections in Chandigarh, including that to the Lok Sabha, municipal corporation, block president and gram panchayat. Expressing his frustration with the national party leadership, Chhabra wrote: “I repeatedly wrote via e-mail to Rahul Gandhi, Venugopal, party incharge Harish Rawat and also to your good self (Sonia Gandhi), but unfortunately got no response from anyone, which ultimately forced me to take this huge step.”According to party insiders, Chhabra, who had been a long-time Bansal loyalist, had a fallout with the senior Congress leader over his role in the party. “They had a different view over what should be his future in the party. Chhabra was looking for a bigger role, but instead was shunted out from the president’s post,” said a party leader, requesting anonymity.A close aide of Chhabra said one of the contentious issue between the two related to the entry of a family member of Bansal into the city’s politics. On Chhabra’s allegations against him, Bansal said: “It does not merit a response.”Meanwhile, Chawla, commenting on Chhabra’s resignation, said: “The Congress is a big party, and people come and go. But the language used by Chhabra in his resignation letter is very disappointing.”Factionalism in election yearThe factionalism in the Congress has come to the centre stage at a time when the party is looking to reclaim the electoral ground lost to the Bharatiya Janata Party.“Chhabra has been associated with the party for the past 35 years. He was a councillor for 15 years, and also a former mayor. He was the party president for the nearly six years. He might not be able to push senior leaders to break the ranks, but at the grassroots, he can get support from the disgruntled elements, which can create a problem for the Congress in the crucial election year,” said a Congress leader, requesting anonymity.Notably, so far, seven other Congress leaders have resigned from the party primary membership in support of Chhabra.“There are strong prospects that Chhabra would either join the Aam Aadmi Party or extend support to it in the MC elections. He has a long association with AAP election in-charge Chander Mukhi Sharma and shares a good equation with him,” said the leader.However, Chawla maintained that Chhabra’s resignation would not affect the party’s chances in the MC elections.On his future course of action, Chhabra said that he would consult his supporters before taking any decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rift-in-chandigarh-congress-ex-president-chhabra-quits-party-101628277480755.html
07-08-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana: Vij suspends 4 Panchkula cops for negligence||Haryana home minister Anil Vij on Friday placed four Panchkula cops, including the station house officer, Sector 5, on suspension for “negligence in duty” after conducting a surprise inspection of the police station. While the home minister cited pendency of complaints, presence of an ununiformed night munshi, non-maintenance of the attendance and departure (ravangi) register, non-deployment of security guard at the entrance and failure to act on the counterfeit currency reported by a bank to justify his action against the cops, senior police officials said the facts were to the contrary. For instance, the minister said he has sought information on action taken with regards to about 143 FIRs that have not been investigated or processed. The fact is that the Panchkula deputy commissioner of police (DCP) on July 27 had asked the SHO to reconcile 125 pending complaints (not FIRs). The SHO in his response said that only 88 complaints were pending for reconciliation, which is an ongoing process. “Often people present complaints through various channels such as the CM window, home minister’s office and DGPs office. Thus, there are multiple copies of the same complaint that need reconciliation,’’ said an official privy to the matter. On the minister’s contention that many applications have been recovered from the SHO’s office on which no action has been taken, the officials said that disposal of a complaint can only be done after conducting an inquiry. “It’s a time-consuming process which required calling both the parties. Panchkula has high number of domestic and money related disputes. The question is how many were pending inordinately. This was never taken into account by the minister,’’ said an official. Earlier, after reaching the police station around 1 pm, Vij checked every room and drawer. According to the orders issued by the Panchkula deputy commissioner of police, SHO Lalit Kumar, munshi Dimpal Kumar, night munshi Ajay Kumar and probationer sub-inspector Mandeep Singh have been placed under suspension.“I wanted to suspend everyone present in the police station. But several documents are yet to come to me. Work is not being done in adherence to law in this police station specifically,’” the minister said, adding that he has asked for an action taken report on FIRs registered in the last one month. Minister versus cops Vij: No action on two fake currency notes reported by bankCops: As per 2019 RBI guidelines, police investigation by filing an FIR is only done when five or more counterfeit currency notes are detected in a single transaction For four or less counterfeit notes, only a consolidated report along with the suspected notes is sent by bank to police at month end Vij: Night munshi not wearing uniformCops: Night munshi is supposed to be on duty at night. He was in station to assist to his colleagues at a time when he should be sleeping Vij: Probationer SI Mandeep Singh’s attendance not marked in registerCops: The SI was in courts for presenting a challan. His attendance is marked in courtVij: No security guard at police station entranceCops: Due to agitation by Asha workers and Huda employees in city, police had to scramble to arrange force. Sanctioned strength of constables (705) in the district is lowest in the state Vij: No record of applications maintained Cops: Every complaint is entered in 5-P register and is accounted for. Courts can summon the records anytime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-vij-suspends-4-panchkula-cops-for-negligence-101628277301475.html
07-08-2021||Chandigarh||Illegal colonies: No registration of properties without NOC till decision on PIL: Punjab to HC||The Punjab government has given an undertaking in the high court that it will not register plots and properties in illegal colonies till a decision on issues raised in a public interest litigation (PIL) are not dealt with.The submissions were made in a PIL filed by a Ludhiana resident, Prem Prakash, who had alleged that authorities are permitting registration of sale deeds/transfer deeds of plots/sites in unauthorised colonies by doing away with the requirement of obtaining a no objection certificate (NOC) from the department of housing and urban development.The petitioner submitted that it was mandatory as per the letters/instructions of January 2018 issued by department of revenue, rehabilitation and disaster management, Punjab. However, authorities in December 2019 withdrew the requirements prescribed in 2018 communication. By doing away with it, the authorities are permitting transfer of plots in unauthorised colonies that have been raised by persons, who are neither the colonisers nor the colonies have been established in accordance with the law, the court was told, adding that due to this entire process of taking action against the unauthorised colonizers have become redundant.He had demanded that the colonies, which were not regularised in 2018 and those coming up after that, should be demolished.It was further argued that setting up and establishing unauthorised colonies is prohibited under the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulation Act, 1995.The government had framed a scheme for regularising the unauthorised colonies, yet without taking any action under the said scheme, the authorities are now permitting sale and transfer of plots and sites of unauthorised colonies without NOC, it was argued.The court was informed that in 2010, the high court had upheld the mandatory condition of obtaining NOC before registration of documents as required by the provisions of Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act, 1975. The state’s counsel said before court that, the December 2019 instructions were issued after obtaining an opinion from the law department. However, in view of the issues raised by the petitioner, the matter would be re-examined by the authorities taking into account statutory provisions as well as the decision rendered by high court in 2010 expeditiously, the state’s counsel had told court adding that till that time 2019 instructions would be kept in abeyance and registration of properties would take place as per 2018 instructions. The high court bench of chief justice RS Jha and justice Arul Palli has disposed of the plea in view of assurance from the state’s counsel with a direction to authorities to consider and decide the issue raised.“It is made clear that this court has not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case and the matter has been disposed of in terms of the issues raised by the petitioner and in terms of the statement made by learned assistant advocate general, Punjab,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/illegal-colonies-no-registration-of-properties-without-noc-till-decision-on-pil-punjab-to-hc-101628277180693.html

07-08-2021||Chandigarh||Pearls Group illegally disposed of properties worth ₹1,200 crore||Despite the Supreme Court ban in 2016, PACL India Limited or Pearls Group, disposed of properties worth ₹1,200 crore bought with investors’ money till a case was registered against it in 2020. Punjab Police made this valuation claim in the chargesheet against Harsatinder Singh Hayer, the son-in-law of Pearls Group owner Nirmal Singh Bhangu, after a special investigation team (SIT), led by Ferozepur range deputy inspector general of police Hardial Singh Mann, found that the properties were disposed of by either selling or illegally transferring them despite the ban. The chargesheet in the case registered in Ferozepur district in 2020 was filed in a Zira court recently by the SIT, including Tarn Taran SP (headquarters) Gurnam Singh, Jalalabad DSP Palwinder Singh Sandhu and Zira DSP Rajwinder Singh Randhawa. Bhangu’s relatives among 55 accused Fifty-five people, including company officials and family members of Bhangu, who is already behind bars for a Ponzi scam involving ₹48,000 crore, were booked for cheating, criminal conspiracy and other sections of the Indian Penal Code at Zira police station on July 16, 2020. The SIT arrested Hayer from Mohali in May this year, while Bhangu’s daughter, Barinder Kaur, was arrested from Delhi airport in July when she was reportedly leaving for the United States. Several other arrests were made on the complaint of Pardeep Singh of Bhadson in Patiala district. In 2016, the Supreme Court restrained the PACL and its directors, promoters and associate companies from selling or transferring properties in or outside India. In December 2015, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) ordered attachment of all PACL assets and its nine promoters and directors for their failure to refund money to investors. A panel headed by Justice RM Lodha (retired) had initiated the process of refunds to investors. The chargesheet said that besides Hayer and Barinder, Bhangu’s nephew Gurpreet Singh Bhangu, his brother-in-law Avtar Singh, company directors and aides, including Munish Jakhar, Tarlochan Singh, Sarabjit Singh Sanghera of Australia, were prime accused. Money trail abroad leads to properties sold illegally “Hayer kept self-attested identity proofs and stamp papers of his employees and other people with himself and used them for the illegal sale of the properties,” the chargesheet said. He transferred huge amounts abroad for investment. The cybercrime report of his mobile phones proved that the money transferred out of the country was collected by selling properties purchased with public money. The police found an agreement for the sale of Golden Public School in Derabassi, for ₹33 crore. Hayer was a member of the governing council of the school spread over 16 acres. According to the sale agreement, the full payment of ₹33 crore was to be made before April 2022, but he took ₹16 crore and registered the sale deed of 7 acres of school land in the name of a Delhi-based firm. Despite the court’s ban, Hayer, his wife Barinder and servant sold the school property bought with public money. “Hayer made cash collected through the illegal sale of the company properties flow into PACL sister concerns,” the chargesheet said. Servants, drivers made company directors After Bhangu was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Hayer, his wife Barinder and mother-in-law Prem Kaur looked after the business. They formed new firms, the directors of which were their relatives, including Avtar Singh and Gurpreet, and servants and drivers, including Manoj Kumar, Ashwani Kumar and Kashmir Singh. “Hayer used their identity proofs for the illegal sale of properties and signed blank cheques to withdraw or transfer the money of illegal sale,” the chargesheet said. It mentioned a transaction of ₹10 crore between the bank accounts of Sanghera and Hayer. Properties in Gurugram, Mohali and Mumbai sold Punjab Police traced 30 new prime properties in Gurugram, Zirakpur and Mumbai that were bought with public money but didn’t get registered with the seizure memo of the CBI. The police seized hundreds of sale agreements of properties in the company. “Hayer also tried to dispose of the Pearls Tourism prime properties in Madagascar,” the chargesheet said. In Mohali district, 112 flats in the Nirmal Chaya project of the company were sold in ₹27 crore without the mandatory approval of the district and sessions judge by company director and accused Munish Jakhar. Besides, company properties in Chachhroli village of Dera Bassi, were illegally sold, the chargesheet said. The accused illegally transferred two flats in Goregaon West in Mumbai, seized by the CBI, without making any payment in 2020 through power of attorney to a private firm. The chargesheet said that the company had 480 acres of commercial land near Cycle Valley at Buddhewal village of Ludhiana district, but it was being illegally cultivated by Karamjit Singh, a relative of accused Tarlochan Singh on rent of ₹74 lakh a year. The rent was not being deposited since 2015. Company directors Gurpreet Singh and Sukhjeet Singh sold properties worth ₹5.78 crore in Daun and Kasba villages of Patiala district. Gurpreet and Sukhjeet along with Bhupinder Singh of Patiala are accused in the case. Illegal sale of properties in Hoshiarpur, SBS Nagar Accused Gurjeet Singh sold 175 kanals of company land at Patial village of Hoshiarpur district, while accused Darshan Singh of Rupnagar sold 274 kanals at Narur village and 464 kanals at Behra village in Hoshiarpur were sold by Sanjay Soni and Anoop Kumar of Delhi. In Garhshankar area of Hoshiarpur district, 160 kanals at Achalpur were sold in a similar way. Nearly 498 kanals situated at Malewal village were illegally sold by accused Manoj Kumar and Ashwani Kumar of Mohali. The PACL gave ₹650 crore to sister firm Petra Estate Private Limited run by Rupinder Singh and Kanwaljeet Singh of Mohali. Later, Petra Estate transferred the amount to Australia and bought properties. “164 kanals of company land were disposed of at Kookanet village in Bathinda district, while the company bought 27 acres at Pohlomajra in Fatehgarh Sahib district only to sell it to its own director, Tarlochan Singh, and his relatives. The Enforcement Directorate also found Tarlochan Singh transferred ₹164 crore of the PACL as its director,” the chargesheet said. PACL agent Rampal transferred commercial properties in connivance with revenue officials in Fazilka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pearls-group-illegally-disposed-of-properties-worth-1-200-crore-101628277060756.html

Talking to newsmen in the national capital, Harsimrat said it was shocking that Parliament was on since the last fortnight and every day, the Congress was demanding an exclusive discussion on the Pegasus spyware surveillance issue. “The Congress should tell the farmers of Punjab as well as the country why it is refusing to raise their voice in Parliament and is insistent on raising the Pegasus surveillance issue only,” she said. Alleging that the Congress had colluded with the Union government to suppress the voice of farmers, the former minister said: “There is no other explanation for the Congress floor strategy.” She said seven parties had got together to raise the demand for repeal of three black laws but the Congress is not pressing for discussion on the issue despite being the largest opposition party. Meanwhile, party president Sukhbir Singh Badal said the SAD-BSP MPs would continue their protest to demand justice for the farmers during the entire session or till the time when the voice of the “annadaata” was heard in Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-enacting-drama-not-raising-farmers-issues-in-parliament-harsimrat-101628276760603.html

07-08-2021||Chandigarh||2012 attack: Biden remembers victims of Oak Creek Gurdwara shooting||Admitting that there has been a rise in hate crime against Asian-Americans, US President Joe Biden mourned the loss of Sikhs in a shooting by a white supremacist at a gurdwara in Wisconsin nine years ago.“On this day, in 2012, I was with another friend who’s half Sikh -- he’s a Sikh. And we were dealing with 10 people shot in a hateful act of bigotry at the Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. Seven people lost their lives that day. Today, we honour everyone impacted by the tragedy,” Biden told reporters at the White House.In an interaction with reporters during his meeting with AAPP civil rights leaders, Biden acknowledged that there has been a rise in hate crimes, harassment, bullying and other forms of bias against Asian-Americans during the pandemic. “It seems not to stop,” he said. Several Indian Americans were invited to attend Biden’s meeting at the White House. Prominent among them were Seema Agnani from the National Coalition for Asian Pacific American Community Development (National CAPACD); Satjeet Kaur from Sikh Coalition; Kiran Kaur Gill from Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund (SALDEF); and Neil Makhija from Indian American Impact.In a separate statement, Rajwant Singh, chairman of the Sikh Council on Religion and Education, thanked Biden for his “compassion” and a “strong stand” against hate and violence. “The Sikh community was shaken by this tragedy and our community still is concerned about the hate filled rhetoric being condoned by some political interest groups,” he said.“The White supremacist groups are on the rise in the recent years and are intimidating many other minority groups in America. President Biden and Vice-President Harris’s stand is unambiguous on this critical issue. This is the most important message that our political leaders can send across the nation and the world,” Singh said.Congresswoman Judy Chu, chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC), said “Today, we remember and honour the seven victims of this domestic terror attack and rededicate ourselves to the values of peace and openness that characterise the Sikh religion.” Nine years ago, the lives innocent worshippers were taken in a senseless act of hate and violence at a Sikh gurdwara, said Congresswoman Grace Meng. “These worshippers were targeted simply because of their religious identity, a pattern that is all too common in the Sikh Community,” she said. Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney said to this day, America continues to grapple with systemic racism and inequality. “It is more important than ever that we recommit ourselves to rejecting hate and intolerance in all forms. These acts of violence and hate are not reflective of our country’s values and we must proactively work to end them by passing legislation to end gun violence,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2012-attack-biden-remembers-victims-of-oak-creek-gurdwara-shooting-101628276585528.html

We will make all arrangements to welcome them like heroes,” he added.Hockey player Navjot Kaur’s father Satnam Singh also praised their team spirit and fight. “The way our daughters fought in this match is commendable,” he said.He said the team’s journey to the semi-finals in the Olympics is the story of struggle of the daughters of India. It will inspire new players to take their legacy forward, he added.Sharing similar sentiments, another player Navneet Kaur’s father Buta Singh said the girls should be considered winners of hearts. “They made all efforts to bring a medal for the country. These daughters of India will be treated in Shahabad the same way as it is done after winning a medal,” he said.The families said their daughters will return on August 10 and not just Shahbad or Kurukshetra but the entire Haryana is ready to welcome them.Family members of the players said it was a tough day for them. They remained glued to the television sets soon after the match started.Rampal said he got up at 5am to watch the match on Friday and prayed for the team’s good performance along with his family at a home-built temple.Navjot’s mother Manjeet Kaur left the room in tears in the final moments of the match and later spoke to her daughter over the phone, praising them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/indian-women-s-hockey-team-deserves-a-warm-welcome-befitting-winners-101628276340689.html

He found respite in religion after his knees blew out nearly three decades ago. Now, he spends most of his time along the banks of Yamuna devoting his time to prayers besides giving training to budding wrestlers of nearby villages.He has prepared a mud akhara where he had trained Ravi Dahiya, Amit Dahiya (youngest Indian wrestler to achieve a medal at the World Championship) and hundreds of others over the decades.Nahri, which has a population of over 15,000, is a nursery of wrestlers. The village has produced international wrestlers including Amit Dahiya (silver medallist in the 2013 World Championship), Arun Kumar (gold medallist in the 2011 Junior Asian Championship), Mahavir Singh (1980, Moscow, 1984 Los Angeles) and Amit Dahiya ( London in 2012).Ravi Dahiya’s father Rakesh said Hansraj had asked him to bring Ravi and his younger brother Pankaj to the akhara on the banks of Yamuna when the elder one was just 6-year-old.“He trained Ravi for the next three years. Then, he asked us to shift Ravi to Chhatrasal stadium in Delhi, where he was groomed by coach Satpal Singh. For the last three decades, he has been training young wrestlers and if he finds potential, he asks the wrestler’s family to shift them to Chhatrasal stadium. He had identified the talent in Ravi,” Rakesh added.Hansraj said he trained many youngsters but Amit was sharper with more natural ability as compared to other players.“But Amit and others haven’t reached anywhere where Ravi has. Ravi had never complained no matter how hard the training was. Even though Ravi lacked the natural skills as compared to other wrestlers, he loved to train,” he said.“If you ask him for 2-hour practice, he will do double the time. Our village has lots of talent, the only need is to discover them,” Hansraj added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/this-ascetic-finds-talent-in-budding-wrestlers-at-haryana-s-nahri-village-101628276283759.html

The deceased has been identified as Rakesh Kumar, 28, who was a resident of Kharar. Police said he used to drive a cab and was planning to migrate to Australia.Eight people, including a woman, have been booked for the murder: Madhav Gupta, Suman Sharma, Gopal Krishan, Deepanshu Singla, Manak Aggarwal, Rajesh Kumar, Rahul and Kiran Bala, all residents of Kharar. The first three have been arrested while the remaining are at large. Jatinder Kumar, who was injured in the clash, told police that he along with Rakesh and others used to organise kanwar yatra to Haridwar every year. The other group also used to organise a separate yatra from the area. Jatinder said the other group was holding a grudge against them for the past couple of months, which led to the attack on Thursday night. According to the FIR, Rakesh and Jatinder were holding some discussions with their friends near Arya College in Kharar around 10:30pm, when Deepanshu, Manak and Rajesh reached there on a bike and hurled abuses at them before leaving. Rakesh called up Deepanshu and objected to it, after which the trio allegedly returned with knives and iron rods and attacked Rakesh. When Jatinder tried to intervene, he was also attacked. Later, other members of the rival group also reached there with baseball bats and sticks and started hitting Rakesh and Jatinder. Deepanshu’s mother Kiran Bala was also present there and kept instigating the group, stated the FIR. Later, the two injured men were rushed to the civil hospital in Kharar, from where Rakesh was shifted to Chandigarh, but he succumbed to his injuries. Jatinder is undergoing treatment for his fractured right leg. Inspector Ashok Kumar, station house officer, Kharar City, said the suspects are drug addicts and three of them have been arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cab-driver-killed-in-group-clash-in-kharar-101628276281619.html

He said the state government has been providing free Covid testing facilities at government health facilities across state while monitoring the rates being charged by private labs and hospitals.Vij said to ward-off the third wave, Haryana is focusing on testing, tracking, treatment, and vaccination.During a Covid-19 review meeting with the districts officers including the deputy commissioners (DCs), Vij said officers should alert people not to lower their guard against the virus. He said gathering of crowds should be prevented in hotels, restaurants, malls and weddings,people should be counselled, and fine should be imposed for non-adherence to Covid prevention guidelines.While directing the officers to take steps to prevent sudden surge of cases, Vij asked them to ramp up testing. He said it should be ensured that the testing rate doesn’t decline.Vij underlined the need of proactive approach by officers to keep a close watch on early signs of a surge in active cases or high positivity rate. He said emphasis should be on administration of second dose of the vaccine.Additional chief secretary (health) Rajeev Arora said pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants have been set up in many districts, especially those with high incidence of Covid.He said liquid medical oxygen (LMO) tanks are present in Karnal, Kurukshetra, Panchkula, Hisar, Jind and Rewari and work to add more LMOs is in progress.Also, gas manifold and medical oxygen pipelines were set up in all district hospitals in 2020-21 at the cost of ₹16 crore and in the year 2021-22, facility of gas manifold and oxygen pipelines is being extended up to community health centres (CHC) level at the cost of ₹36 crore, he said.In addition, oxygen concentrators as well as invasive and non-invasive ventilators are also available in sufficient quantity, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rtpcr-test-to-cost-rs-299-at-pvt-labs-hospitals-in-haryana-101628275800572.html

07-08-2021||Mumbai||Take steps based on scientific advice to fight Covid-19: Scientific community||Scientists, students, teachers and researchers from across the country are appealing to the government to take adequate steps based on scientific advice supported by data to counter the Covid-19 pandemic.The appeal comes days ahead of the Indian chapter of March for Science is scheduled to take place on Monday. Since 2017, scientists worldwide have been holding March for Science rallies to promote rationality and scientific temper and to remove the hurdles in the path of the onward march of science and social progress. The Indian scientific community, too, has been holding marches in the first week of August to highlight the problems facing science on Indian soil. These include the abysmally low governmental support for education and scientific research, the concerted propaganda by some powerful groups to propagate unscientific and obscurantist ideas with the support of the ruling dispensation, and the fact that governmental decisions are not guided by evidence-based science. While this year, amid the Covid-19 pandemic, no major rallies will be conducted, Soumitro Banerjee, one of the organising members, said that in cities where it is now allowed, a congregation of 10-15 from the scientific community may hold rallies. Banerjee is a professor at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata and the general secretary of Breakthrough Science Society (BSS), a voluntary organisation working towards the cause of science, culture and scientific outlook.Last year, scientists associated with the India March for Science had suggested concrete measures to tackle the pandemic in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “However, the government has chosen to ignore this evidence-based scientific advice, precipitating a disaster when the second wave struck. While doctors, nurses and other health workers struggled valiantly to treat COVID patients handicapped by hopelessly inadequate healthcare infrastructure conditions, unscrupulous people were busy peddling untested concoctions as remedies for COVID, often with government support,” said the scientists in a statement.The Indian scientific community has prepared a charter of appeals for the state as well as central governments. These include a demand for putting a stop to the propagation of unscientific, obscurantist ideas, ensuring that the education system does not impart ideas that are not based on or contradict scientific evidence, allocating at least 10% of the Central Budget and 30% of State budgets to education and ensuring that at least 3% of the country’s GDP is used to support scientific and technological research. Another demand is to increase the financial support to scientific institutions and increase the fellowship tenure of PhD students by the period lost to the pandemic.“The charter of demand has been prepared in discussion with members of the scientific community across the country. A few programmes have been planned as part of the march. Thereafter, the appeal will be sent to the central and state governments,” Banerjee said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/take-steps-based-on-scientific-advice-to-fight-covid-19-scientific-community-101628275568660.html

07-08-2021||Other||HT Readers’ take: Chandigarh and its periphery in choppy waters!||Civic amenities missing in city’s periphery Waterlogging has become a regular occurrence in the tricity. The main reason is that rapid urbanisation in Chandigarh’s periphery is not accompanied by simultaneous provision of civic amenities, mainly stormwater drainage. What worsens the situation is that MC officials and elected councillors are indifferent to people’s problems. The need of the hour is to upgrade civic infrastructure and also make rainwater harvesting mandatory for all residential and commercial buildings in Chandigarh and its surrounding areas. Surbhi Negi, Panchkula Need comprehensive review of drainage system Waterlogging has become a regular feature in the tricity and its periphery. The main stormwater drains may have been well-designed but inadequacy of road gullies and blockages appear to be the culprit. There is need for a comprehensive review of drainage system, including those in periphery areas. Piecemeal design of drainage pockets will only complicate matters and increase the agony. Unapporoved and illegal construction after approval of the masterplan often create more problems by disturbing the existing and planned flow patterns of the stormwaters. Multiple civic authorities, with least coordination and lack of technical know-how, will fail the best of designs and derail all positive efforts to address the drainage issue. DS Banati, Mohali Use development charges for infra upgradeTo prevent the recurrence of the sinking feeling every time, the drainage system of societies in the periphery of Chandigarh need to be upgraded. Unfortunately, the MC has completely failed to do so, though they are charging an amount as development charges from builders. Loopholes and lapses need to be unplugged by desilting the choes and cleaning the stormwater drains in congested old localities. Garv Bhupesh Verma, Panchkula Proper drainage outletsRecently, rains painted a sorry picture of various places in Chandigarh and nearby areas such as New Chandigarh (Mullanpur) and Zirakhpur, where flooded roads and cracked foundations became a nightmare for the residents. A comprehensive drainage system with surface and sub-surface drains, proper discharge outlets and segregation of rain and sewerage water must be provided to Chandigarh as well its periphery areas to avoid such a situation. Komal Sharma, New Chandigarh A bane for new residential areas Knee-deep inundation after just an hour of rain is acceptable in places such as old Delhi, which were developed years ago, but not for places such as Zirakpur, Mullanpar or Manimajra, which have come up in the last few years. Even after so many technological advancements, if problems such as waterlogging are a regular feature of new townships, it only points to apathy of the authorities. Desilting of nearby rivulets for longer periods or construction of high-rise apartments may be a reason for waterlogging but the fact remains that lack of proper drainage system is a major problem.SC Luthra, Chandigarh Fix accountabilityThe basic problem is the lack of fixing accountability at every level—be it the person who builds such townships, the person who is supposed to work out the plan, the field staff who are supposed to be on ground and check for problem areas. Only then can the laws in existence be implementedChander Vij, via email New townships not properly planned The war between Mother Nature and man’s needs or greed is not new. As per the original plan of Chandigarh, the whole area covering Mohali, Zirakhpur and Panchkula were to act as the lungs of the city for fresh breath of air. With an increase in the population across the city, new areas were needed for the people to live in. That has resulted in the construction of skyscrapers around the city in the last one decade. All agricultural land was taken over by developers. The colonies and townships that have come up don’t have a proper plans or drainage systems. Moreover, these block the natural streams of rainwater or seasonal rivulets. All these contribute to nature hitting back. Suresh Verma, ChandigarhMaster plan needed for periphery areasHaphazard growth of apartments and housing complexes near periphery of Chandigarh such as Zirakpur, Kharar, Nayagaun etc are main causes of flooding. The MCs concerned should develop a master plan for their area to cater to future expansion and make a central sewerage system to avoid recurring flooding and choking of drains. There should be a proper drainage system along the roads, bridges and culverts to allow free flow of water. Finally, efforts should be made to segregate plastic waste to ensure it does not choke drains and sewerage pipelines. Col.TBS Bedi.(Retd), MohaliCheck illegal colonies The population increase and rapid, unplanned urbanization are the main reasons why waterlogging has become a regular feature in the city and its surrounding areas. To find out an alternate solution. Punjab & Haryana government, along with the UT administration, should seek out a proper solution for this grim situation. At least, they should have to take initial action to stop all illegal colonies and unplanned concrete constructions. Sandeep Rawat, Chandigarh Rain readinessMunicipal corporation must take certain measures before the onset of monsoon to ensure there is no waterlogging. These include: proper cleaning of roads to keep them litter-free so that there is no chance of drains choking, re-laying of roads for proper drainage of accumulated water, doing away with plastic bags as these are the biggest cause of blockage, identification of areas prone to waterlogging so that water pumps can be dispatched to these areas for quick clearing of water. Prabhjot Nagpal, Zirakpur The unplanned periphery of planned cityChandigarh is a well-planned city but attention must also be paid to its peripheries. When roads are constructed, a public committee must be formed to keep an eye on construction work so future problems can be averted. Rainwater must be harvested for groundwater recharge. People should be senistised against the use of polybags and irresponsible discarding of household garbage, which lead to choking of drains. The municipal authorities must ensure timely cleaning of storm sewers. Subhash Nagpal, Zirakpur Stop encroachments on seasonal waterwaysApart from clogged drainage pipes and manholes, the main reason for waterlogging in the city is unauthorised encroachments on natural seasonal waterways in the periphery, which hampers the free flow of rainwater. While the Chandigarh administration should clear the unauthorised encroachments in villages falling in its territory, it should ask Punjab and Haryana governments to do the same in areas under its jurisdiction. Regular cleaning of underground pipelines and manholes in the city should be undertaken. AK Sharma, Chandigarh Fix responsibility Last week, in addition to periphery areas such as Zirkpur, Mullanpur, Khuda Lahora, almost the entire tricity was inundated. Unfortunately, this chronic issue which is wreaks havoc every year does not seem to get the attention of policy makers. Due to lack of regular maintenance of stormwater drains, it monsoon, residents are left high and dry. The need of the hour is to fix the responsibility of the person (s) concerned. SK Khosla, ChandigarhRainwater harvesting, natural drainage system The monsoon rain brings both pleasure and pain. We enjoy the rain as it brings a huge relief from the summer heat. But just after a brief spell of rain, we see waterlogged roads and drains, causing a lot of pain to all of us. The poor drainage system is to be blamed for inundated houses and roads in the city and its outskirts. Civil engineering work on the roads is also faulty as water gets accumulated on the roads. Proper designing of the lanes and bylanes in the periphery is needed for rainwater management. We need rainwater harvesting schemes in the city and surrounding areas. Very often, the natural drainage in an area, along with good water management, is sufficient to eliminate excess water and preclude the need for expensive subsurface drainage systems. Anil Kumar Yadav, ChandigarhAdvanced and modern drainage systemClogged, flooded and sinking are the words one needs to describe Zirakpur during rains. A city that is fast developing with high-rise buildings needs a good drainage system to avoid such a system. Moreover, adjoining rivulets should be desilted and cleaned to ease the flow. Other additional measures should be taken to ease the flow of the rivers. To prevent flooding, embankments should also be constructed along the river. Plastic also chokes and clogs the drains. Therefore, throwing plastic into the drains should be completely prohibited. Drainage lines should also be cleaned on a regular basis. An advanced and modern drainage system should be put into place. Instead of having paved tiles everywhere, there should be some grounds with soil to help absorb the water. Saikrit Gulati, ChandigarhLack of peripheral controlDespite the many merits, our beautiful city has often been plagued by lack of peripheral control. Following are a few suggestions to improve the same: There needs to be a constitutional body with representatives from Chandigarh UT, Punjab, Haryana to decide on the overall planning. Prepare a GIS- based physical planning model with special emphasis on natural slopes and drainage, and draft bylaws accordingly. GIS-backed water management plans be chalked out with a network of small reservoirs for proper channeling of water. All new development projects often neglect factors such as natural drainage, in order to achieve more and more sq.ft of built area. Strict implementation of site development guidelines should be ensured, and heavy penalties should be levied on developers flouting these.Kamal Passi, via emailIt’s nature hitting back! The havoc let loose by rainwater is result of man-made blockages due to illegal construction that get regularised over the years under political patronage and money power. Silt-free wider stormwater drains are an insurance to avert recurring devastation by waterlogging in residential areas and submerged potholed roads. A suo motu strict intervention by the NGT and superior courts can undo all construction in illegal colonies coming up in violation of notified master plans in different areas. Water is life but fury of uncontrolled water threatens life and property alike. Lalit Bharadwaj, PanchkulaCleanliness and regular checksThere should be regular maintenance checks by the authorities to decrease the scope of flooding. Cleanliness is a must if flooding takes place as people can get infected with various diseases due to waterlogging. Construction of dams and reservoires should be properly planned and should be regularly inspected.Ishita Nara, via email Streamline procedures for licensed projects, illegal colonies The root cause for mushrooming illegal colonies and construction violations in Chandigarh’s periphery is the failure of multiple authorities to ensure enforcement of the notified Master Plans and the Punjab Apartment & Property Regulation Act, 1995. As a long term solution, the state government, through a task force, should take steps to review the licensing policies. As for already regularised colonies, the authorities must ensure upgrade of infrastructure and drainage system. Hardaman Singh Bhogal, MohaliIdentify problem areas, take corrective measuresHandling nature’s fury is a challenging task but routine problem being faced every year can be managed if the administration takes up the matter seriously. If possible the experts of the engineering wing should identify the areas prone to waterlogging during monsoon season and dig safe boreholes on nearby vacant land to divert extra water into them through underground channels and save it for use after treatment. Undoubtedly, the process will also help to recharge the groundwater levels. Surinder Paul Wadhwa, Mohali Re-design drainage systemMushrooming of unauthorised colonies, faulty levelling of roads, unplanned stormwater drainage cannot happen without the consent of authorities. Responsibility must be fixed and measures should be taken to ensure residents don’t face such a problem. At the outset, all housing societies and colonies must have well-designed rain harvesting system. Secondly, levelling of roads and plinth levels of houses should not be considered in isolation and must be done for the complete area. Last and not the least, stormwater drainage must be redesigned. Sqn Ldr Manjit Singh Johar (retd), ChandigarhReader of the week:Check haphazard construction Unauthorised and haphazard development needs to be stopped. Authorities also need to think of creating a robust system for unobstructed and free surface runoff as per natural slopes leading rainwater to rivulets and choes to avoid urban flooding. A drainage plan as per natural topography should be drawn for Zirakpur to implement long-term and short-term measures. Floodable areas along rivulets, choes and Ghaggar river should be identified and notified under ‘The Canal and Drainage Act’. No development should be allowed in the notified floodable zones, and in the already developed areas, obstructions and encroachments should be removed. Apart from that, rainwater harvesting should be made mandatory for each property. MS Aujla, via email What experts say:Clean up!Congress is responsible for waterlogging as they failed to clean the drains and choes for four years. They didn’t even lay any new drainage pipe in Zirakpur. There won’t be any waterlogging if natural choes are cleaned properly. NK Sharma, Dera Bassi, MLAStormwater drainage Zirakpur is an old town, which has no stormwater drainage system. But now with new technology, authorities can come up with an integrated master plan so as to solve the problem of waterlogging. Also, the natural choes must be cleaned regularly.Devinder Singh, GMADA chief engineerRainwater recharge systemEven though Zirakpur MC is collecting crores on the account of external development charges (EDC), it has completely failed to develop infrastructure. We suggest the authorities come with rainwater recharge system to replenish groundwater.Harish Gupta, president of the Zirakpur Builders AssociationMan-made barriersAuthorities should deal with people carving out illegal plots on river banks as it blocks the flow of river water and causes flooding even after light rain. An illegal bridge has been constructed in Shiv Nagar panchayat, which slows down the flow of the water as the pipes used are not of proper dimensions.Kulbir Singh Bisht, Nayagaon MC councillor Damaged roads Roads get damaged due to movement of heavy vehicles and this in turn leads to waterlogging. Repair and maintenance of roads should be the responsibility of mega project developers. They should also ensure drains are cleaned so that water does not stagnate.

The arrested men had uploaded mobile numbers on Internet, impersonating themselves the employees of a food joint in Delhi, and gave lucrative officers on home delivery of food. They duped over 100 persons by promising home delivery of alcohol during the lockdown in Pune and Bengaluru, the police said.“The arrested men had cheated a government official of ₹82,500 in the name of delivering food packets that were ordered for a farewell organised at the government office,” said deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse, adding that four mobile phones, 28 SIM cards and Brezza car purchased using cheated money were seized from the arrested men.DCP Alphonse said that the government official had filed a complaint in July regarding the cheating. The complainant alleged that food packets were needed for the retirement program in the office and the contact number of a shop was found on the internet. The person who received the call introduced himself as an employee of the food joint and sent a bar code to the complainant for making the advance payment for the order.“As the complainant scanned the bar code, ₹82,500 were deducted from the bank account in four transactions. However, the food packets were not delivered. A case was registered and investigation was taken up,” the DCP said.Through technical investigation, the police learnt that the money was transferred into bank accounts in Mewat through a UPI ID. Also, a fake mobile number of Odisha was used in the office and its location was in Haryana’s Mewat, Bharatpur in Rajasthan and Khamman in Telangana. The phone number was uploaded on different websites for home delivery of liquor in Maharashtra and Karnataka.“We kept the mobile number on surveillance and found that the suspects were travelling towards Uttar Pradesh from Madhya Pradesh. Our cyber cell team followed the trail and after travelling around 1,000 kilometres, the two suspects, identified as Tarif Khan and Taufiq, were arrested from near Agra in Uttar Pradesh,” added DCP Alphonse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhitwo-held-for-duping-after-posing-as-employees-of-a-food-joint-101628275263513.html
07-08-2021||Chandigarh||Will recruit 450 counsellors, experts to resolve matrimonial disputes: Punjab DGP||Punjab director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta on Friday inaugurated a new building for the centre for crime against women and children in Rishi Nagar, a state-of-the-art indoor sports stadium at Police Lines and ‘Book Nook’, a modern library space for cops’ families and children. He also announced that the Punjab Police will be recruiting around 450 professional counsellors and experts with the required skill sets to work together with the private panel members to resolve matrimonial disputes. He also directed Ludhiana police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal to make the family counselling centre an all-women staff unit so that women coming to lodge their complaints feel comfortable. DGP Gupta reiterated that preventing the crimes against women had remained the topmost priority of the Punjab government and the police and in upcoming recruitments of over 10,000 police personnel at sub-inspector, head constable and constable ranks, one-third will be the women force.When asked about the status of arrest of Lok Insaf Party chief and MLA Simarjeet Singh Bains, who is facing rape charges, the DGP said that investigation in the matter was on. The counselling centre, which has provision of 44 rooms, in-house photocopy and typing facility, canteen, rooms for feeding newborn babies, play area for kids, reception, rooms for private counselling members and psychologists and doctors, will also accommodate the offices of ACPs and in-charges of women cell from all four zones of the city at a single centrally located place, he added.Interacting with the panel members at the counselling centre, the DGP said that they were playing a vital role in creating a healthy society and must focus on reuniting the families through counselling.Police commissioner Agrawal informed the DGP that earlier, the counselling centre was functioning from four zonal offices located at random buildings, which were in dilapidated condition. While inaugurating sports complex at Police Lines, the DGP said that the major objective of this robust infrastructure was to maintain their health and fitness.He said that this stadium comprised world-class facilities, including a carpeted badminton court, yoga and meditation room besides as officer’s lounge and a gymnasium equipped with the latest workout machines with a pleasant view of the surroundings which would encourage police personnel and their families to remain fit and healthy. “Specially trained gym trainers will work on physical condition, body strength, and assign appropriate exercise activities and create unique workout routines to help the police personnel become the best version of themselves,” added the DGP. Book Nook, an innovative reading-cum-activity area for wards of police personnel has been launched in collaboration with an NGO, Aas Ehsaas, to promote reading habits among the kids of cops, the DGP said. It is said to be a brainchild of ADCP (Zone 1) Pragya Jain.The salient features of the Book Nook are its aesthetic ambience, which has educational, fictional and non-fictional books for four to 18-year-olds besides an attractive thematic tent with several board games and indoor educational activities to boost motor activity coordination.The wards of police personnel of all ranks can avail the facilities, he said, adding that the daughter of an employee working as a gardener at the Police Lines would be handling the reception and day-to-day functioning which will promote a sense of ownership and belonging. The DGP also asked the Ludhiana police chief to establish such libraries and reading rooms for senior citizens as well so that they can come there and convert their free time into productive activities.Commending Agrawal and his team for actively working towards ensuring efficient delivery of services to people, the DGP exhorted them to come up with more such ventures for overall betterment of families of brave police force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-recruit-450-counsellors-experts-to-resolve-matrimonial-disputes-punjab-dgp-101628275262840.html
07-08-2021||Chandigarh||MC official leading team to ban plastic bags in Ludhiana transferred||Ludhiana Municipal corporation (MC) secretary Jasdev Sekhon has been transferred to the Abohar MC by the Punjab local bodies department. The transfer order, issued on July 30, was received on Friday, while Sekhon was away to Prayagraj (Allahabad) on an official visit to study solid waste management.Notably, Sekhon is in-charge of the 13-member MC team that has been confiscating plastic carry bags as part of a drive started on August 2. He was transferred to the Ludhiana MC from Hoshiarpur in August 2019.Under the Solid Waste Management and Cleanliness and Sanitation Bylaws, 2020, MC has banned the use of plastic carry bags in the city and a fine up to ₹20,000 can be levied for violations.With Sekhon getting transferred, mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu said the drive against plastic ban will continue and another official will be deputed to lead the team.He said he had no information why the transfer order was issued and the decision had been taken at the state level.When contacted, Sekhon also denied having any information regarding the reason behind his transfer and said he will follow the orders following his return from Prayagraj. After the drive began on Monday, MC team confiscated over 12.25 quintals of banned plastic bags till Tuesday and issued fines worth ₹2 lakh to violators. No raids were conducted after Wednesday due to rainfall in the city and Sekhon then left for Prayagraj on Thursday. While the ban on plastic bags is in place across Punjab since April 2016, MC has so far been unable to rid the city of their use, primarily due to resistance from the plastic industry and political interference. On Wednesday, a group of plastic industry representatives had also met the mayor seeking permission to manufacture and sell plastic bags with thickness of 50 micron and above, as a complete ban will destroy the industry, which is already reeling under losses due to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mc-official-leading-team-to-ban-plastic-bags-in-ludhiana-transferred-101628275200450.html
07-08-2021||Delhi||DDMA chalks out fresh Covid strategy for Delhi||Advanced sero-surveys for better identification of susceptible pools, augmenting genome sequencing efforts to keep better track on variants of the Sars-Cov-2 virus, and granular data and trend analysis for location-based measures to control the infection - these are among the strategies chalked out by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Friday to prepare for potential waves of the Covid-19 in the future and keep the disease in check in the Capital.After a meeting chaired by DDMA chairperson and lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Friday, the agency said it will also work towards ensuring adequate health infrastructure, medical oxygen and availability of essential drugs, by August 31. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who is also the vice-chairperson of the DDMA, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and health minister Satyendar Jain also attended the meeting, along with NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul, AIIMS chief Dr Randeep Guleria, ICMR director general Dr Balram Bhargava and NCDC director Dr Sujit Singh.“After detailed discussion with experts, it was decided to undertake aggressive and targeted surveillance and testing in areas, locations and specific activities to ascertain and address any trends of concern. The experts stressed upon continued vigil and caution, and suggested that all steps related to preparedness for any probable surge in infections, in terms of hospital infrastructure, oxygen and drugs availability, should be put in place and operationalised by the end of August,” said a senior DDMA official present in the meeting.The official further said, “It was also suggested that the comfort provided by the current controlled situation be utilised for undertaking an advanced sero-survey that takes into account extended epidemiological dimensions so as to identify susceptible pools (with regard to potential infection) and augment the genome sequencing efforts with an aim of prioritising vaccination. The Health Department was accordingly advised. They also suggesting analysing granular data to figure out trends which will help develop location-based measures.”Delhi on Friday recorded 44 new Covid-19 cases in 24 hours with a positivity rate of 0.06%. At its peak, the city recorded around 28,400 cases in a day on April 20 and a positivity rate exceeding 36% on April 22. In the fourth wave of the pandemic – that coincided with the country’s second – in Delhi, the healthcare system was overburdened and the city faced a severe shortage of medical oxygen that contributed to deaths of Covid-19 patients.Another senior DDMA official, who also attended Friday’s meeting, said, “Experts present in the meeting lauded the Delhi government’s efforts to control the second wave and bringing back a stabilised environment in Delhi. They suggested that focus should be on increasing the pace of vaccination at this stage.”Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases division at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said, “At this stage, the government should focus on micro containment efforts. Also, they should focus on location specific strategies with regard to tests, awareness drives and vaccination. The DDMA is working in the right direction regarding this policy. Things should be controlled at an early stage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/advanced-sero-surveys-augmenting-genome-sequencing-as-ddma-chalks-out-fresh-covid-strategy-for-the-capital-101628275023029.html

07-08-2021||Delhi||Child has right to use mother’s surname, says Delhi HC||Every child has the right to use his or her mother’s surname and a father can’t dictate terms, the Delhi high court observed on Friday while hearing a plea by a minor girl’s father seeking direction to the authorities to reflect his name as his daughter’s surname in the documents and not otherwise.“The father does not own the daughter to dictate that she should use only his surname. If the minor daughter is happy with her surname, what is your problem?” Justice Rekha Palli remarked adding that it is “unfortunate” that the parties are litigating this aspect.“I see no merit in the present writ petition. The apprehension that the LIC [policy] will be dishonoured is wholly misconceived and is an attempt to somehow settle scores with his estranged wife,” she said, while refusing to pass any order.During the hearing, the man’s counsel submitted that his daughter is a minor and cannot decide such issues on her own, claiming that the surname was changed by his estranged wife.He claimed that the change in name will make it difficult to avail insurance claims as the policy was taken in the name of the girl with her father’s surname. The mother had changed the surname from Shrivastava to Saxena.The court, which declined to allow the plea, noted that even the birth certificate on August 10, 2018, issued by the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) also will have both the names.The judge disposed of the petition with a liberty to the man to approach his daughter’s school to show his name as the father.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/child-has-right-to-use-mother-s-surname-says-delhi-hc-101628274960469.html
07-08-2021||Delhi||Govt sets up panel to decide on opening schools, colleges in Delhi||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Friday decided to set up a committee, including officials from the education and health departments, to work out a strategy to reopen educational institutes in the Capital, said a senior official, adding that deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia reportedly told the DDMA meeting that at least 90% of the parents who attended the mega parent-teacher meeting (PTM) of students of government schools are in favour of reopening schools.“The issue of opening schools and educational institutions was deliberated upon in detail. In accordance with the suggestions by experts, it was decided to set up a committee, including officials of education and health departments, to evaluate and finalise a detailed plan comprising standard operating procedures (SOPs); assessment of the ability of schools to implement such SOPs and plan for vaccination of teachers and staff; and address concerns of parents of the students. A decision on reopening will be taken thereafter... It was noted that in principle, there is no harm in opening schools provided certain pre-requisites in place,” said the official who did not wish to be identified.The DDMA meeting was chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, who is the chairperson of the DDMA, and attended by Delhi chief minister and DDMA vice-chairperson Arvind Kejriwal, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and health minister Satyendar Jain. NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul, AIIMS chief Dr Randeep Guleria, ICMR director general Dr Balram Bhargava and NCDC director Dr Sujit Singh also attended the meeting.The official further said that of the 33,000 people who wrote to a e-mail feedback campaign, 68% respondents wanted schools to reopen and 83% voted for colleges to reopen.“Sisodia highlighted how the Covid-19 pandemic has already caused too much loss in terms of ‘learning’ and cited a recently held PTM in which, he said, 90% of the 800,000 parents who attended the meet, voted in favour of re-opening of schools,” said an official who attended the DDMA meeting on Friday.The special PTM was conducted in Delhi government schools from July 19 to 31 to guide parents on online education and seek their suggestion on reopening of schools.Dr Jacob John, former head of the clinical virology department at Christian Medical College in Tamil Nadu’s Vellore, said: “The authorities have to plan each step meticulously. Re-opening of schools and education institutes should ideally be done in a phased manner. We have to remember that children are yet to be vaccinated against Covid-19 and the state governments should not only keep demanding that children be vaccinated but also propose plans to the central government. Delhi can consider opening senior classes in a few schools in each district and observe trends for a period – say two weeks. They should take further calls based on the observations in each phase. They also must ensure that the entire staff – teachers to administrative officials and bus drivers – are fully vaccinated at least two weeks before schools and colleges open.”Schools and colleges in the national capital have been closed since March last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Classes briefly resumed in a staggered manner between January and February before being suspended again due to the fourth wave of the pandemic in the Capital.“We all are waiting for normalcy to be restored. As teachers we are worried about the dilution that online teaching and examination has caused. However, the university needs to bring a well thought-out plan. Reopening cannot be a rushed exercise,” said Abha Dev Habib, treasurer at Delhi University Teachers’ Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-sets-up-panel-to-decide-on-opening-schools-colleges-in-delhi-101628274959891.html
07-08-2021||Delhi||Protest in Delhi’s Dwarka against upcoming Haj house||A large group of residents from Dwarka and nearby urban villages on Friday staged a protest against the construction of a proposed Haj house in Dwarka’s Sector 22 and said such a building may lead to a “law-and-order problem” in their area, even as several other residents took to social media to claim that the protest was being spearheaded by right-wing groups.Protest leader Ajit Swami, who is also the president of the All Dwarka Residents Federation (ADRF), claimed otherwise and said it was the federation, which has over 300 villages near Dawrka as members, that led the protests.“We have written to lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal, who is also chairperson of the DDA (Delhi Development Authority), asking him to cancel land allotment made for the Haj House. There will be a law-and-order problem if the Haj house is constructed here,” said Swami.The LG did not respond to requests for comment.“The money for the construction could be used for another noble cause. There are no such houses/facilities for people of other faiths who go pilgrimages,” he said, and added that protests will continue till the land allotment is cancelled.It is to be noted that Delhi does not have a Haj house unlike other states, even though the national capital is the largest embarkation point for the pilgrimage in the country. Nearly 15,000-20,000 Muslims from Delhi, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, western Uttar Pradesh and Chandigarh leave for Mecca in Saudi Arabia, the holiest city for Muslims, from Delhi every year and they usually stay in camps set up at Ramlila Maidan and Dargah Faiz Illahi before flying out.According to the details of the construction, the proposed Haj house will be able to accommodate at least 350 pilgrims at one time. An area of around 5,000 sqm has been allotted for the project, show DDA records.Aam Aadmi Party Sleemapur MLA Abdul Rehman, a nominated member of the Delhi State Haj Committee, said the protests were “politically motivated”.“ Why should anyone have a problem if a few people come together for a short stay before embarking on a pilgrimage? The land where the house in being built does not belong to any private person, not has it been usurped or encroached by anyone. Our country is a land of many religions. People want to live peacefully. Some are out to divide the country on religious lines and we request the government to act against such motivated protests.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/protest-in-delhi-s-dwarka-against-upcoming-haj-house-101628274900951.html
07-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra housing regulator extends deadline for projects due in April to Oct||In view of the devastating second Covid-19 wave, the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRera) has evoked the ‘force majeure (unforeseen circumstance)’ clause and extended the completion, revised extension and extended completion dates of real estate projects that were due on or after April 15 by six months to October 14.This extension will not be applicable to projects whose completion date was before April 15.The order issued by MahaRera on Friday read: “…whereas the second wave was much more devastating than first wave and has caused great loss to human lives as well as economy. And consequent lockdowns have caused disruption of supply chains for obtaining construction material, labour work, forced migration and slowdown in pace of construction. Therefore, in order to aid government efforts in controlling the damage caused due to Covid-19 and ensure that completion of MahaRera-registered projects do not get adversely affected, it has been decided to issue this order.”Builders have welcomed the order, stating that it has brought a much-needed relief to the sector. “The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has been a major challenge for the real estate sector,” said Niranjan Hiranandani, national president, National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO), an association of the builders. “Activities at various construction sites across the country were severely impacted. MahaRERA’s move to extend the deadline by invocation of force majeure for six months is a welcome step,” he added.The last extension on similar grounds was issued during the first wave of Covid-19, wherein an extension was granted from March 15 to September 14, 2020.The real estate sector had been facing a huge slowdown in the past few years and the Covid-19 pandemic has paralysed it further. Builders are unable to complete their projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-housing-regulator-extends-deadline-for-projects-due-in-april-to-oct-101628274900500.html
07-08-2021||Delhi||DPCC launches survey to count industrial units, identify water polluting ones||The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has launched a survey across industrial clusters in the national capital to assess the total number of units that are functional as well as identify “water-polluting” units that may be running without approval, thereby exacerbating the pollution in river Yamuna.The pollution control agency, on August 3, sent letters to associations of 28 industrial areas across the city in this regard. The effluents discharged from illegally running units go into drains, which eventually empty into the Yamuna, adding to its pollution load, a DPCC official, privy to the matter, said.“The survey is a long-drawn process and the first such full-fledged exercise to assess the actual number of units operating in each industrial area. It has been kick-started from Patparganj Industrial Area. We are going door-to-door to check on the functioning of the units and to understand procedural issues. A lot of the pollution in the river is caused by untreated effluents. This exercise will help us address the gaps in the process,” said the senior DPCC official, requesting anonymity.The confirming industrial areas include those located in Narela, Bawana, Mayapuri, Wazirabad, Patparganj, Okhla, Jhilmil, Naraina (phase -I and II), Najafgarh, Kirti Nagar, Tilak Nagar, Badli and Moti Nagar, among others.The officials further said the survey is being conducted to create a database on the number and kind of industrial units in each cluster. “According to the data available with us, it appears that there is a gap between the number of units that are actually operating in the industrial areas and the number of units that have taken consent under the ”water polluting” category,” the letter dated August 3 stated.Industrial units are given consent by the pollution control board to operate under different categories based on the nature of their work. The survey will help establish the total number of units running under different categories and the permissions taken for the same, said officials.All industries are required to have small effluent treatment plants (ETPs), wastewater from which goes into larger common effluent treatment plants (CETPS). In several areas, it has been observed that the wastewater discharge is not reaching the CETP; rather, it is being released directly into drains. There are 13 such CETPs in Delhi.The DPCC August 3 letter to industrial areas further stated that a recent quality analysis of wastewater samples taken from the CETPs revealed that most plants were not meeting the prescribed standards.Industry owners, however, believe that instead of just collating a database on confirming industrial areas, the DPCC must also survey units located in unorganised and non-confirming industrial clusters, as well as getting CETP operators to improve the functioning of their plants.Ashish Garg, general secretary, Narela Industrial Complex Welfare Association, said, “Every industry owner in the area, even if it’s a closed unit, has to pay operational charges for the CETPs. These plants need to be fixed as they are treating a larger quantity of wastewater,which is discharged into the river. Also, the actual “water-polluting” units are the ones that are functioning without any checks in clusters such as Gandhi Nagar and Sultanpuri. There are multiple units in these areas engaged in dyeing and other such work,” said Garg.Last year, a National Green Tribunal (NGT)-appointed Yamuna monitoring committee had raised concerns over untreated or partially treated effluents being discharged into drains had said only three of the 13 CETPs meet environment standards. Many units are not connected to any of the treatment plants. It also asked the DPCC and other agencies to explore strategies to deal with the issue at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dpcc-launches-survey-to-count-industrial-units-identify-water-polluting-ones-101628274841842.html
07-08-2021||Delhi||Priest sentenced to life in prison by Delhi court for rape of two minor girls||A Delhi court sentenced a 76-year-old priest to life imprisonment for repeatedly raping two minor girls within the “sacred precincts of a temple” at a village in Mehrauli in 2014, saying that the accused is a “habitual sexual predator” and has “desecrated the temple where the children should have had a carefree and safe time”.Additional sessions judge Vijeta Singh Rawat said the convict,Vishva Bandhu, did not even care for the respect and faith attached to his office as a priest. She said the offences were committed repeatedly on two girls,aged seven and nine years, showing the rapacious and habitual conduct on the part of the convict.“…such habitual sexual predators cannot be trusted. He has not even cared for the respect and faith attached to his office as a priest and has also desecrated the temple where the children should have had a carefree and safe time. Therefore, the interest of justice would only suffice if the convict is sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for life and fine of ₹50,000/-,” Rawat said in a 12-page order, dated July 16.She said the convict “betrayed the trust and respect the victims and the public had upon him”. It also noted that no remorse was shown by him at any stage of the trial. On February 26 this year, the court convicted the priest of rape and under relevant sections of the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.“In the facts and circumstances of this case, if leniency is shown, this court would be letting down children who have fought all odds to pursue the matter. These victims have been scarred for the future. The court would also be failing in its duty if such predators are set free...,” said Rawat.The judge also noted that the crime has not been committed by the priest due to any mental or emotional distress. It said considering that extremely vulnerable victims were preyed upon by the priest repeatedly, despite his advanced age, there seems to be no scope for reformation.“Rather, considering that minor children... had been repeatedly raped by the convict, who was then aged about 69-70 years, irrefragably speaks volumes about the depravity and proclivity in the mindset of the convict, which is an aggravating circumstance,” said the court.The judge also ordered a compensation of ₹7.5 lakh each to the two victims to secure their emotional and mental health, and to ensure that they have access to unhindered education that will equip them for a safer future.According to the prosecution, the incident came to fore when one of the victims complained to her mother of pain in her lower abdomen and difficulty in passing urine before finally breaking down and revealing to her the repeated assault. The mother checked with her daughter’s friend, who admitted that she too was sexually assaulted by the same priest.The girls told their parents that the priest sexually assaulted them every time they went to the temple to play or have ‘prasad (sweet offering)’. He threatened them against talking to anyone about the assault.The accused, then 70 years old, was arrested on August 18, 2014, after the parents of the girls lodged a complaint against him the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/priest-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-by-delhi-court-for-rape-of-two-minor-girls-at-temple-101628274839841.html
07-08-2021||Chandigarh||13-year-old accuses cop of rape, Ludhiana police chief marks inquiry||Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal has ordered an inquiry by additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, city 1) Pragya Jain after a 13-year-old girl accused a police personnel of rape.In her complaint to the commissioner, the child said on July 21, her friend and her boyfriend took her to a hotel, where she fell unconscious after consuming a soft drink. On waking up, she found herself naked and realised she was raped.Thereafter, her friend and her boyfriend dropped her at the civil hospital, where a staffer took her to the hospital police post.The girl alleged at the post, one of the police personnel removed her clothes for physical examination. He then took her to an isolated location in his car and raped her, before dropping her off at a child care home. At the home, she repeatedly requested the staffers to let her talk to her parents, but they did not heed her appeals. Eventually, after two weeks she was able to talk to her parents and was brought home.Her parents alleged that after their daughter revealed the matter to them, they lodged a police complaint against the cop and her friends, but no action was taken.The cop, who is facing the inquiry, refuted the allegation, saying that after the hospital staffer brought the girl over, she was sent to the child car home after medical examination. ADCP Pragya Jain said appropriate action will be taking following the investigation. Meanwhile, no FIR has been lodged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/13yearold-accuses-cop-of-rape-ludhiana-police-chief-marks-inquiry-101628274785444.html

The varsity officials said the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), the nodal agency which decides on matters related to the Covid-19 pandemic, is yet to allow in-person classes on campuses.The move to restart in-person classes was also opposed by the faculty body, Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA), which raised concerns about whether Covid-19 protocols could be properly implemented in “crowded” labs and classrooms.Registrar Vikas Gupta said the varsity wanted to wait for DDMA guidelines. “We got information from our colleagues that the DDMA hasn’t allowed the reopening of schools and colleges as yet and it will be reviewing this matter soon. So we have decided to defer the reopening until further notice,” he said.In the DDMA meeting held on Friday, it was decided that a committee, comprising education and health officials, will evaluate whether educational institutions are ready to reopen with safety protocols in place. The committee will also be responsible for drawing up the safety protocols and standard operating procedures (SOPs) as well as checking the vaccination status of staff, and addressing concerns of all stakeholders.Several stakeholders, including DUTA, welcomed this. Treasurer Abha Dev Habib reiterated that the reopening could not be “rushed”, and the university needs to have a plan in place for it.“As the vaccinations for the 18+ age group is currently underway, the university should give time to students to complete their vaccine doses. Teaching in overcrowded rooms and labs would pose a health hazard to all. Many teachers and non- teaching staff, who fell ill during the second wave of Covid, are getting their first dose of the vaccination only now,” she said.At least five principals that HT spoke to said outstation students are not keen on attending in-person classes as they fear a third wave of the pandemic and are apprehensive about finding accommodations at short notice, not to mention their pending vaccination status.Ramjas College principal Manoj Khanna said, “We have received countless emails from students saying they prefer to practice in virtual labs and expressing their wish to prioritise health over everything else. We will not need more than a week to implement the SOPs, but before that, the university and colleges should consult all stakeholders to form a plan on how classes are to continue.”Meanwhile, several other universities in the capital are now waiting for a clearance from the Delhi government to reopen campuses. Yogesh Singh, vice-chancellor of Delhi Technological University, said, “Keeping the pandemic in mind, we introduced a system of continuous assessment last year and a modified version of that will continue this year as well. As far as reopening is concerned, we will wait for the government guidelines.”Singh said in order to accommodate outstation students, the university will work out a system for using hostels while maintaining Covid protocols. “If the Covid situation in Delhi remains stable, we will allow PhD students and final-year students to return to the campus in a staggered manner. Classes will, however, continue in a blended mode ( online and offline).”Mahesh Verma, vice-chancellor of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University (GGSIPU), said they have also conducted vaccination drives on campus to ensure all staff members are vaccinated. However, the varsity has not maintained any data on this.“Most of our staff have been vaccinated. As far as students are concerned, according to our academic calendar, final-year students are currently appearing for their examination. Students who have started their final-year this academic session are currently continuing in the online mode. Many students “pandemic fatigue” and want to visit campuses but we cannot allow that to happen until all are safe,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/du-cancels-move-to-restart-classes-from-august-16-says-will-wait-for-ddma-nod-101628274784492.html
07-08-2021||Delhi||Missing Trilokpuri-Mayur Vihar link inaugurated||Delhi Metro on Friday inaugurated the much-awaited missing link between Mayur Vihar pocket-1 and Trilokpuri-Sanjay Lake stations on the Pink Line, making it the longest single Metro corridor in the city, spanning 59 kilometres between Majlis Park and Shiv Vihar.“This is a significant effort to decongest Delhi and further strengthen the state-of-the-art, green and resilient metro rail network...The stretch might appear to be a small section but this is a significant link in providing connectivity on this corridor,” said Union minister for housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri, who along with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal flagged off the first train on the section in a virtual ceremony on Friday.Kejriwal too stressed on the importance of this 290-metre section in completing the overall corridor. “This is a small but critical stretch. (Delhi Metro Rail Corporation managing director) Mangu Singh and I met several times to find a solution for the rehabilitation issues pertaining to this stretch,” he said.The section was formally thrown open for passengers from 3pm.Many passengers who travelled on the section on Friday said that the link will be a huge benefit for residents living in pockets of Trilokpuri, who till Thursday had to get down at Mayur Vihar pocket-1 and wait for rickshaws to reach their homes.“The availability of e-rickshaws and cycle rickshaws are good outside Mayur Vihar phase-1 station, because it is closer to the main road and the footfall there is more. But because pocket-1 station is located on the internal road and not many passengers get down here, we have to wait for several minutes to get a ride till Trilokpuri. This becomes even more difficult after dark. Even if you get a ride, they wait till the rickshaw gets more passengers, which is inconvenient,” said Bharti (only first name), who lives in Trilokpuri road number-27.While the existing Pink Line was made functional by the Delhi Metro in 2019, the link between Mayur Vihar pocket-1 and Trilokpuri was stuck due to land acquisition and rehabilitation issues as over 100 houses in Trilokpuri’s block-15 fell on the route of the metro corridor.Eventually, after several rounds of talks with the residents, a lottery was held for allotment of flats to the affected families under the supervision of the Delhi high court. Work on finishing the section began after the displaced residents were rehabilitated.DMRC on Friday said that with the opening of this corridor, the Pink Line has become a fully operational ‘Ring Corridor’. With this, the total metro network in the Capital is now 390 kilometres long and has 285 stations, including the Noida–Greater Noida Metro Corridor and the Rapid Metro in Gurugram.“The construction of this stretch was a challenging task for DMRC as the work was repeatedly hampered by the pandemic induced lockdowns and issues such as the non-availability of workforce. Completion of this work was a significant achievement because the civil construction on this stretch continued despite the hurdles and concluded within the set deadline,” DMRC said in a statement on Friday.The Delhi Metro also said that the Pink Line corridor will be further extended under phase-4, eventually making it the only ‘Ring Corridor’ of the Metro in the country.“This corridor will further be extended from Majlis Park to Maujpur in phase-4, making it the longest single Metro corridor in India at approximately 70 km. After completion of phase-4, the Pink Line will also become the only Ring Corridor of Metro in the country,” the DMRC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/missing-trilokpuri-mayur-vihar-link-inaugurated-makes-pink-line-longest-metro-corridor-in-delhi-101628274783069.html
07-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi assembly speaker says will move SC against provisions of the GNCTD Act||State assembly speaker Ram Niwas Goel on Friday said that he, as a representative of the House, will approach the Supreme Court against provisions of the Government of National Capital Territory of India (Amendment) Act which, he said, curtails the powers of the legislative committees that come under the domain of the House.“We will not challenge the entire Act. The call on whether or not to challenge the entire Act in the court will have to be taken by the government. I cannot comment on that aspect,” Goel said in a press conference in Vidhan Sabha on Friday.Goel later clarified that he will file the appeal before the top court as a representative of the Assembly.The Act, which makes the Lieutenant Governor’s (LG) prior opinion a must before every executive action by the Delhi government, and every legislative action by the state assembly, was notified in Delhi on April 27, after being passed in both houses of Parliament the previous month.While the Aam Aadmi Party and other Opposition parties across the country criticised the law, the Centre said it promotes “harmonious relations between the legislature and the executive, and further defines the responsibilities of the elected government and the Lieutenant Governor, in line with the constitutional scheme of governance of Delhi, as interpreted by the Supreme Court”Through the amendment, a provision has been added in the original GNCTD Act that prohibits the Assembly or its committees from making rules to take up matters concerning the day-to-day administration of Delhi, or to conduct inquiries in relation to administrative decisions. This has effectively derailed several assembly committees, particularly two that are dealing with issues related to the north-east Delhi riots that happened last year.Goel on Friday told reporters that the decision to challenge provisions of the Act was taken after the Supreme Court’s favourable verdict in a case involving the assembly committee on peace and harmony examining the role of a social media company in the Delhi riots by refusing to quash summons sent to a top executive of the company.“We believe the court will restore the powers of the Assembly which have been taken away through a law which is completely undemocratic and unconstitutional. We have taken legal consultations on the matter,” Goel said.The Supreme Court on July 8 held that Facebook must appear before a Delhi assembly committee to respond to queries regarding its role and other aspects of the February 2020 Delhi riots.The Act was also the subject of a charged debate in the assembly last week. Leaders of the AAP argued that the law is “unconstitutional” and “anti-democracy”, as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) asserted that the law did not weaken the powers of the Delhi Assembly.On several occasions in the past four months, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia have said that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Delhi government have plans to challenge the law in the Supreme Court and are taking legal help on the matter.BJP MLA Vijender Gupta said, “The GNCTD Act does not reduce the power of the Assembly in any way. We fail to understand why the AAP wants to bring up the issue after eight months. Also, no committee of the Delhi Assembly has been nullified. The GNCTD Act asks that rules of the Assembly committees should be in line with rules that apply in the Lok Sabha. The law prohibits interference on day-to-day administrative work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-assembly-speaker-says-will-move-supreme-court-against-provisions-of-the-gnctdact-101628274599850.html
07-08-2021||Lucknow||Tokyo Olympic stars from Uttar Pradesh want jobs in home state||A day after India won a historic bronze medal in men’s hockey at the Tokyo Olympics, ace midfielder Lalit Kumar Upadhyay expressed the wish to play for Uttar Pradesh in future if he is given a lucrative job offer in any government department in the state.The 27-year-old hockey player from Varanasi has been serving an oil company as assistant manager at Mughalsarai for the last seven years.Keen to play for his home state at the next nationals, Upadhyay said serving “your own state” is very important for a player like him.Similarly, women’s team forward Vandana Katariya, who scored four goals including a hat-trick at the Tokyo Olympics where the Indian women’s team finished a historic fourth, too expressed the desire to shift to UP after leaving the Railways.“Yes, I would love to do a job in UP, given the right opportunity,” she said from Tokyo on Friday.“Many state governments across the country are offering lucrative jobs, including the post of deputy superintendent of police (DSP). I would love to serve my own state if given similar a job opportunity in the days to come,” said Lalit, adding, “When I get to meet CM Yogi Adityanath Sir the next time, I will surely make an official request to him.”The chief minister recently announced the re-launch of recruitment of sportspersons in almost all the government departments under a 2% quota system. The effort is being viewed as “great” support to the Uttar Pradesh sportspersons, many of whom have been playing for other states after getting jobs there.“As the CM said, the process of filling the 2% sports quota in government offices has begun. Soon, the government will come out with some more plans for sportspersons, including a raise in their prize money,” a top government official said on condition of anonymity.“The government is committed to the development of sports and sportspersons. That’s the reason why the chief minister himself addressed all the 10-Tokyo Games bound athletes from Uttar Pradesh through a virtual meeting. Thereafter, an additional sum of ₹2 lakh for their preparation/kits was assured, besides sanctioning the mandatory ₹10 lakh as participation fee,” he said.As promised by the chief minister before the start of the Tokyo Games, all the 10 athletes and their families are expected to have a face-to-face interaction with Yogi Adityanath later this month at a function here.“We are in the process of finalising the date for the felicitation of all the 10 athletes and their families at a function here in the last week of this month,” said the official.Uttar Pradesh Olympic Association secretary Anandeshwar Pandey, too, supported the demand of Uttar Pradesh athletes for jobs in their own state.“The UPOA has been fighting for this cause since long and this would be a great gesture by the state government if it offers suitable jobs to deserving candidates.”“Filling sports quota vacancies in the state government is a very good move and I hope that many more would get suitable jobs in various departments in the near future,” he said.“This is the way to bring all the migrant sportspersons back into our fold. It will help raise the sports standard of Uttar Pradesh at the national and international levels,” he added.As per the government’s scheme, Lalit Kumar Upadhyay would get ₹1 crore for his bronze-medal win and an additional ₹2 lakh as preparation fee, whereas nine others would be richer by ₹12 lakh each.A steep raise in the prize money is also likely in the near future, according to those privy to the issue.“We are trying to ensure parity with the prize money for athletes of states like Haryana. If everything goes well, Uttar Pradesh too would offer one of the biggest purses to Olympic medallists,” said another official.HOW UP ATHLETES FARED AT TOKYO GAMESLalit Kumar Upadhyay (hockey, Varanasi): Bronze medal.Vandana Katariya (hockey, Meerut): Fourth position.Saurabh Chaudhary (pistol shooting, Meerut): Seventh position.Mairaj Ahmed Khan (skeet shooting, Bulandshahr): 25th position.Shivpal Singh (javelin, Varanasi): Failed to qualify for the finals.Annu Rani (javelin, Meerut): Failed to qualify for the finals.Seema Punia (discus, Meerut): Failed to qualify for the finals.Priyanka Goswami (walk-race, Meerut): Finished 17th.Satish Kumar (boxing, Bulandshahr): Lost in quarterfinal.Arvind Singh (rowing, Bulandshahr): 11th position.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/tokyo-olympic-stars-from-uttar-pradesh-want-jobs-in-home-state-101628272021225.html

Dhyan Chand’s three gold medals at consecutive Olympic Games in 1928, 1932 and 1936 were still the best-ever by any Indian sportsperson in the world. Ashok Kumar, son of Dhyan Chand, welcomed the government’s move, saying: “Dhyan Chand belongs to the whole country and hockey is our national game. Sports awards should be named after sportspersons. This Khel Ratna was first named after honourable Rajiv Gandhi but it’s better to name these awards after sportspersons connected with it. Our country and our Prime Minister took notice of this today, because of the increasing popularity of hockey now.” There celebrations in Prayagraj, where Dhyan Chand was born on August 29 in 1905; Jhansi and Lucknow, where he spent his playing days. His fans distributed sweets to mark the renaming of the award. Khel Ratna awardees get a prize of ₹25 lakh. Ashok Kumar also showered praise on the Indian hockey teams at the Tokyo Games. “Our men’s team won a medal and the women’s side won hearts. The entire country is celebrating their performances. It’s a big occasion for all of us,” he said. He thanked the nation for keeping Dhyan Chand’s name alive. “There is no doubt that athletes and sports fans have kept Major Dhyan Chand’s name alive even today. And now this Khel Ratna award will take that legacy forward. He (Dhyan Chand) is still alive in our hearts.” Uttar Pradesh Hockey, the official unit of the Games’ governing body, Hockey India, too welcomed the PM’s announcement to rename the award after Major Dhyan Chand. “It’s a great moment for Uttar Pradesh Hockey as we all grew up hearing the tales of Dhyan Chand Ji on the hockey field. He has been the ideal of all hockey players in India. In our playing days, we all wanted to play like him,” said RP Singh, who also happens to be a former India hockey captain. “Most of our hockey astro turf stadiums in UP (14) are already named after Major Dhyan Chand. The stadium in his name at the Guru Gobind Singh Sports College here has witnessed many big events like 2016 Junior Men’s Hockey World Cup and Gold Cup Tournament in the past,” he said. “It’s a golden double for UP, as after the success of hockey players like Lalit Kumar Upadhyay and Vandana Katariya at the Tokyo Games, we got to see the government renaming the sports award in the name of Major Dhyand Chand,” added Singh, who is also UP’s sports director.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sports-awards-should-be-named-after-sportspersons-says-maj-dhyan-chand-s-son-101628265784838.html
07-08-2021||Chandigarh||Why no final decision against judicial officer indicted of graft in 2018: HC to registrar||The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Friday issued a notice to its registrar-general to file a status report on why no decision has been taken against additional sessions judge Hemant Gopal, who is under suspension, on the basis of an inquiry report dated March 31, 2018. Gopal is under suspension since 2013 after former MLA Mangat Rai Bansal produced a video CD as proof of a gratification racket involving the said judicial officer, who was then posted as a judge in the special CBI court, Mohali. Gopal was indicted in the preliminary inquiry and later in the final inquiry, but despite the report submitted three-and-half years ago, the high court has not taken any action. Petitioner Bansal’s counsel further submitted that in pursuance of inquiry report, Punjab government’s law officer Sushil Kumar, who had acted as middleman and collected the bribe money, has since been dismissed from service, however, the high court has not taken a decision against Gopal. Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan issued the notice to the registrar general of the high court and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). “The registrar general of this court is directed to submit a status report as to why no final decision has been taken against the said officer on the basis of the inquiry report dated 31.03.2018,” reads the order of Justice Sangwan, who was apprised by advocate Vishal Nawarna, appearing for the petitioner. The bribery case against the judge pertained to allegations by one of the accused in a paddy embezzlement case that law officer Singla ‘struck a deal’ on behalf of additional district sessions judge Gopal. Also an accused in the paddy embezzlement case, Bansal circulated a video CD showing Singla collecting ₹40 lakh as bribe from another accused, Parminder Singh, allegedly on the behalf of Gopal on April 17, 2013. In the embezzlement case itself, Bansal and 23 other rice millers were accused of paddy embezzlement and causing a loss of ₹1.8 crore to the exchequer. The CBI registered a case in 1999 and the trial was completed in 2013. Pronouncing the judgment, CBI judge Hemant Gopal had convicted 22 people and acquitted Parminder Singh and one Bachni Devi. “The above-said judgment had been passed by you by extraneous considerations. Thus, you committed gross misconduct, acted against the judicial canons, lowered the image of the judiciary in the eyes of public and acted in a manner unbecoming of a judicial officer,” the petitioner’s counsel quoting the content of the inquiry report, a copy of which is in possession of HT, conducted on the orders of the high court against Gopal. The operative part of the inquiry report reads: “Per discussion and findings recorded above, I hold that all the allegations as contained in the article of charge, are proved against the delinquent officer, Shri Hemant Gopal, Additional District & Sessions Judge (sic).” The court has fixed August 24 as the next date of hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/why-no-action-against-judicial-officer-indicted-of-graft-in-2018-hc-to-registrar-101628264879920.html

They are working in responsible posts and shouldn’t behave indecently,” said state home minister Narottam Mishra.Also Read | MP floods: 2 dead, PM Modi reviews situation with CM ChouhanUnder the new rules, Mishra said, disciplinary action will be taken against employees indulging in indecent protest for violating the civil services rules.“All departments have been asked to inform employees about the civil services rules and what is inappropriate behaviour,” said another officer of the general administration department.Employee union leaders alleged it was the first time the state government was “trying to take our democratic right of protest away, citing civil service rules”.“In the past few weeks, over 2,000 employees of 313 janpad panchayats and the rural development department have been booked by police for violating orders duly promulgated by public officers. They were suspended and some contractual employees were fired. We never saw such inhuman and undemocratic behaviour against employees for staging protests. Now, they are calling it a violation of civil services rules,” said Dinesh Sharma, a leader of the employee union.The employees said if the government fulfils their demand on time, they will not protest.“We staged a protest only after our demands were not met for a long time. Protests are the only way to bring our long-pending demands to the attention of officers and ministers towards, and the now government wants to snatch away our right. We won’t tolerate this suppressive decision,” said Laxminarayan Sharma, general secretary, MP Class 3 Employees Association.The Congress also supported the employees’ unions. “The BJP-led state government is coming up with such decisions as they are afraid of being exposed. The government fooled the employees and is now trying to suppress them. We are with them and will not allow the state government to behave undemocratically,” said KK Mishra, spokesperson, MP Congress Committee.However, the BJP said the decision to stop “indecent” protests is not to suppress anyone. “The government employees are part of the system and they should behave decently. They can sit on dharna, stage protests and shout slogans, but does it look nice to take off clothes and to break earthen pots? The employees themselves should feel that they should adopt a decent and appropriate way of staging protest,” said Rajneesh Agrawal, spokesperson, BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-to-take-disciplinary-action-against-employees-who-stage-indecent-protests-101628251919297.html

Andrew Cuomo could face misdemeanor charges if investigators substantiate a criminal complaint accusing the governor of groping an aide last year, the Albany County sheriff said Saturday.Sheriff Craig Apple promised a “very comprehensive” investigation but said it would be premature to commit to a timeline or say whether Cuomo himself will be questioned.“We have a lot of factfinding to do. We have a lot of interviews to do," Apple told reporters. "We’re not going to rush this because of who he is. We’re not going to delay this because of who he is.”The complaint, filed this week, is the first known instance where a woman has made an official report with a law enforcement agency over alleged misconduct by the Democratic governor.The aide says Cuomo reached under her shirt and fondled her when they were alone in a room at the Executive Mansion last year. The woman also told investigators with the attorney general’s office that Cuomo once rubbed her rear end while they were posing together for a photo.Cuomo’s lawyer, Rita Glavin, has said the allegation was fabricated.“He is 63 years old. He has spent 40 years in public life and for him to all of the sudden be accused of a sexual assault of an executive assistant that he really doesn’t know, doesn’t pass muster,” Glavin said.Apple declined to release the complaint Saturday but described the allegation as “sexual in nature.” He said his office has a “proven record” of helping victims, adding he does not fear retaliation for moving forward with such a high-profile investigation.“I'm the county sheriff. I'm not going to be intimidated. I'm not going to be coerced,” he said. “That would not play out well for anybody.”Cuomo has faced renewed calls to step down after an independent investigation overseen by the state attorney general’s office concluded he sexually harassed 11 women and worked to retaliate against one of his accusers.The attorney general’s report describes a series of times Cuomo allegedly acted inappropriately with the aide described as Executive Assistant #1, culminating with the groping encounter at the mansion in November 2020.According to the woman, Cuomo pulled her in for a hug as she prepared to leave the governor’s office at the mansion. Told that “you’re going to get us in trouble,” Cuomo replied, “I don’t care,” and slammed the door shut. He slid his hand up her blouse, and grabbed her breast over her bra, according to her account.“I have to tell you, it was — at the moment, I was in such shock that I could just tell you that I just remember looking down seeing his hand, seeing the top of my bra,” she told investigators.She said she pulled away from Cuomo, telling him “You’re crazy.”Apple said he has requested investigative materials from the attorney general's office.“I think we've all read the attorney general's report,” he said. “At this point I'm very comfortable and safe saying she is, in fact, a victim.”Cuomo has adamantly denied touching the woman's breasts, saying “I would have to lose my mind to do such a thing.”The state Assembly’s judiciary committee plans to meet Monday to discuss the possibility of impeachment proceedings against Cuomo. Nearly two-thirds of the legislative body have already said they favor an impeachment trial if he won’t resign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ny-governor-cuomo-could-face-misdemeanor-in-groping-case-says-albany-sheriff-101628356565919.html

It arrived at the GEM in the early hours of Saturday, the ministry said.The boat was transported as a single piece inside a metal cage carried on a remote-controlled vehicle imported especially for the operation, said Atef Moftah, supervisor general of the GEM project.The vessel, discovered in 1954 at the southern corner of the Great Pyramid, has been exhibited for decades at a museum bearing its name at Giza Plateau.Egypt says the Grand Egyptian Museum, which has been under construction intermittently for 17 years, will contain more than 100,000 artifacts when it opens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypts-ancient-king-khufu-s-boat-is-moved-from-giza-pyramids-to-a-new-home-101628355650154.html
07-08-2021||World||Iran nuke talks could resume in early September, says EU official||Iran is ready to resume talks reviving the nuclear deal with world powers under new president Ebrahim Raisi, and meetings could take place in Vienna from early September, an EU official said on Saturday.The senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the EU's negotiator on the file, Enrique Mora, attended Raisi's swearing-in in Tehran last Thursday and spoke with the Iranian official designated to take charge of the nuclear talks, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.Amir-Abdollahian "is supposed to be the new foreign minister" in Raisi's cabinet, but that has not yet been announced, the EU official said.He added that it was unclear whether the nuclear talks would remain under the responsibility of the Iranian foreign ministry or be taken over by another body, such as Iran's National Security Council.Raisi is a hardliner expected to consolidate the ultraconservatives' power during his four-year term.He succeeds the relatively moderate Hassan Rouhani whose landmark achievement during his own two-term presidency was the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and six world powers: the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany.Former US president Donald Trump pulled out of the deal in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions that have choked Iran's oil-dependent economy. Iran responded by walking back measures it had agreed to abide by.Talks have been happening since April in Vienna to find a way to bring both sides back into full compliance.The last round took place on June 20 with no date set for when they would continue. The EU chairs the meetings.The United States has said it is "an urgent priority" to get Iran back to the table.But tensions have risen, notably with an attack by drones last week on an Israeli-linked tanker off Oman that killed a Briton and a Romanian on board.The G7 -- the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan -- blamed the attack on Iran. Tehran denies the accusation.Iranians want 'success'Iran's decisions to increase uranium enrichment and restrict UN inspectors' access to some nuclear facilities have unsettled the West."The EU would like Iran to freeze the nuclear activities," the EU official said, but admitted Russia and China did not back its language on that position.He added that Mora's meeting with Amir-Abdollahian was "very useful", even though many issues remain unclear.The Iranians said they want to get back to Vienna "as soon as possible, not just for talks but to achieve an agreement -- they want a success," the EU official said.He added that the Iranians had not mentioned any changes to their position in the talks, and Mora had informed the United States of the substance of his talks with Amir-Abdollahian."If there is no agreement, the situation for Iran will be much worse," the EU official predicted. "We will work on the assumption we will get an agreement."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-nuke-talks-could-resume-in-early-september-says-eu-official-101628355773688.html

Govt scientific adviser thinks so||The threat of another surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases exists but further lockdowns may not be required in Britain, a government scientific adviser has said.Speaking to Times Radio, John Edmunds, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said he was “cautiously optimistic” that another lockdown won’t be needed even if the UK sees a possible Covid-19 resurgence, fuelled by lives returning to normal.“We’re not doing that this time. But I don’t think we will need to go into a lockdown. I hope not anyway. I very much hope not. I’m cautiously optimistic about that,” he said.Also Read | What are the Covid entry rules for travellers to European countries?After a sharp decline in daily Covid-19 cases, the United Kingdom has been reporting a surge in infections for the past few days.

The infections are expected to rise in September when schools and colleges open for new academic sessions and more workers return to office spaces.“Will we ever return to completely normal behaviour? I don’t know. But there’s a long way to go between the sorts of behaviours that we’re collectively making now and the average behaviour that we were making before the pandemic. There is a big difference,” Edmunds added.On July 19, Britain removed almost all restrictions even as the country continued to report a worrying surge in Covid-19 cases. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government relied on relatively high vaccination coverage to reopen the economy badly hit by months of curbs. More than 57% of the UK population has been fully vaccinated and nearly 12% of the population has received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-uk-never-return-to-lockdowns-govt-scientific-adviser-thinks-so-101628353253565.html

Khalilzad, the Afghan-born US special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, said earlier this week that the Afghan government is too weak to win a negotiated settlement without a new military strategy.“The situation is very concerning, and our expectation is that both the government and the Talibs would focus on a political settlement,” Khalilzad said at the Aspen Security Forum on Tuesday.Also watch | 'Taliban kill woman for not wearing veil'; dark times back in Afghanistan?Khalilzad, known as the architect of the US-Taliban deal for an American troop pullout reached in February 2020, said that it’s now necessary for the government to find its “military bearings” with the Taliban surging.Also read | US urges citizens to immediately leave Afghanistan as Taliban intensifies attackThe special envoy’s comments came on a day a car bomb blast was reported followed by sporadic gunfire in Kabul near the heavily fortified Green Zone. Several civilians and Taliban members died in that attack. Afghan defence minister General Bismillah Mohammadi survived an assassination attempt involving a car bomb and Taliban hit squad.A day later, the Taliban said its fighters had carried out the deadly attack targeting the Afghan defence minister and warned of more "retaliatory operations" against top government officials. Three days later a senior government information official was shot dead in the street. And on Saturday, the Taliban seized Sheberghan city in Jawzjan province, the second provincial capital to fall to the insurgents in less than a day.Also read | Deterioration in security situation in Afghanistan is serious, says JaishankarAs the Taliban is rapidly advancing throughout Afghanistan, experts have expressed apprehension that the insurgents aim to re-establish their harsh brand of Islamist rule, including the repression of women and the independent media, by force. Local media reported earlier this week the Taliban dragged a 21-year-old woman out of a car while she was on her way to the Balkh district centre and shot her dead for not wearing a veil.According to several reports, Islamic fundamentalists have issued diktats forcing women to cover themselves from head to toe, ordering them not to leave home without a male relative. The group has even banned shops in captured areas from selling goods to women not accompanied by a male relative.Khalilzad, who was appointed as the special envoy three years ago, and the then US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said at that time that he would assist “us in the reconciliation effort." A Pashtun like many members of the Taliban, Khalilzad was seen by many as someone who understood the nuances of Afghan culture land and spoke both Pashto and Persian fluently. However, many Afghans have time and again pointed out his advocacy for and business dealings with the Taliban before the September 2001 attacks.In the past, Khalilzad has insisted that the Taliban had changed and said that they were not the same group who deceived the Clinton administration in pre-9/11 diplomacy.Also read | Tensions flare as Taliban gun down top Afghan govt officialBut now the veteran US diplomat has painted a bleak picture of the peace process and said that “at this point, they are demanding that they take the lion's share of power in the next government given the military situation as they see it.”Michael Rubin, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, has said in an opinion piece in the Washington Examiner that it’s time the US recalled Khalilzad home. “His judgment proved wrong, and he has lost control of the process. Rather than interfere where Afghans no longer want him, it is time to investigate the intelligence failures, poor assumptions, and misjudgments that tainted the peace process from day one,” Rubin wrote on Friday.“Khalilzad should spend his days at Senate hearings answering questions about what went wrong and why,” he added.Retired General David Petraeus warned of an “increasingly dire security situation” inside Afghanistan. Gen Petraeus, who oversaw US forces in Afghanistan until 2011 and later headed the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), called the outlook “very, very grim indeed.”The congressionally mandated Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction warned on Tuesday that the US was leaving behind a country which “remains poor, aid-dependent, and conflict-affected, with any potential economic growth in the short term further limited by the lingering effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.”(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-afghanistan-paying-for-zalmay-khalilzad-s-oversights-101628345157544.html

If the city falls, it will be the second provincial capital in as many days to succumb to the Taliban. Several other of the country's 34 provincial capitals are threatened.On Friday, the Taliban took control of the southwestern Nimroz provincial capital of Zaranj, where the government says it is still battling insurgents inside the capital.Sheberghan is particularly strategic because it is the stronghold of US-allied Uzbek warlord Rashid Dostum, whose militias are among those resurrected to aid the Afghan National Security and Defense Forces.Heavy airstrikes were reported by residents of Sheberghan who also said the Taliban had freed prisoners from the city jail. They requested to remain anonymous fearing retaliation from both sides.Taliban fighters have swept through large swathes of Afghanistan at surprising speed, initially taking districts, many in remote areas. In recent weeks they have laid siege to several provincial capitals across the country as the last US and NATO troops leave the country. The US Central Command says the withdrawal is more than 95% complete and will be finished by Aug. 31.The US Air Force continues to aid the Afghan air force's bombing of Taliban targets in southern Helmand and Kandahar provinces as Afghan security forces try to prevent a Taliban takeover.On Saturday, the US and British embassies in Kabul repeated a warning to its citizens still there to leave “immediately” as the security situation deteriorated.On Friday, Taliban fighters assassinated Dawa Khan Menapal, the chief of the Afghan government’s press operations for local and foreign media. It came just days after a coordinated attempt was made to kill acting defense chief Bismillah Khan Mohammadi in a posh and deeply secure neighborhood of the capital.In a report to the UN Security Council on Friday the U.N. envoy for Afghanistan urged the council to demand the Taliban immediately stop attacking cities in their offensive to take more territory.Deborah Lyons also called on the international community to urge both sides to stop fighting and negotiate to prevent a “catastrophe” in the war-torn country.In Afghanistan's Helmand and Kandahar provinces in the south of the country thousands of Afghans were displaced by the fighting and living in miserable conditions.In Helmand's provincial capital of Lashkar Gah, Afghanistan's elite commando forces aided by regular troops were trying to dislodge the Taliban but with little success, said Nafeeza Faiez, a provincial council member. Taliban are in control of nine of the city's 10 police districts.Faiez said conditions for residents are desperate as they hunker down inside their homes, unable to get supplies or get to hospitals for treatment. Many of the public buildings have also been badly damaged in the fighting.“People have no access to any service,” she saidMore than half of Afghanistan’s 421 districts and district centers are now in Taliban hands. While many are in remote regions, some are extremely strategic, giving the Taliban control of lucrative border crossings with Iran, Tajikistan and Pakistan.The insurgent force on Friday closed one of the country's most lucrative borders with Pakistan at Spin Boldak in southeastern Afghanistan. The Taliban were protesting a demand from Pakistan that all Afghans crossing the border must have Afghan passports and Pakistani visas.The group said Pakistan was implementing the demands of the Afghan government and demanded that previous procedures in which identities were rarely checked as people crossed the border be reinstituted.Thousands of Afghans and Pakistanis cross the border daily and a steady stream of trucks passes through, bringing goods to land-locked Afghanistan from the Arabian Sea port city of Karachi in Pakistan.Hundreds of people were waiting Saturday to pass through and more than 600 trucks, many loaded with perishable fresh foods, were backed up in both countries.Islamabad’s relationship with Kabul has been troubled, with both sides accusing each other of harboring militants. Afghan Taliban leaders live in Pakistan and Kabul is bitterly critical of Pakistan for aiding them and treating their fighters in hospitals in Pakistan. Islamabad meanwhile charges that Kabul provides a safe haven to the Pakistani Taliban, a separate militant group that regularly stages attacks in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lawmaker-says-taliban-enter-north-afghan-provincial-capital-sheberghan-101628338987491.html

Official says alerted civil aviation ministry||As the airfares for destinations between India and the United Kingdom have skyrocketed amid peak student season, a government official on Saturday said he has alerted the ministry of civil aviation regarding the issue. Earlier this week, Britain moved India from its “red” to “amber list”, which means fully vaccinated travellers from India will no longer have to go under mandatory 10-day hotel quarantine."The UAE, Qatar, India and Bahrain will be moved from the red list to the amber list. All changes come into effect Sun 8th August at 4 am," UK transport secretary Grant Shapps announced on Twitter.While the UK’s decision has come as a relief for the Indian diaspora who had been demanding the easing of travel norms, the pent up demand due to over three months of travel ban and peak student season has led to a steep rise in airfares.The fare of British Airways for one way travel from Delhi to London on August 26 is ₹3.95 lakh, according to Google Travel. The cost of ticket between the two cities on other airlines, including Air India and Air Vistara range from ₹1.2 lakh to ₹2.3 lakh. Sharing screenshots of minimum airfares between Delhi to London for the economy class, Sanjeev Gupta, secretary at the ministry of home affairs, raised concern about the high prices during college admission time.“Fare of ₹3.95 lakh one way Delhi to London on Aug 26.

While Apple insisted the process is secure and designed to preserve user privacy, not everyone is convinced.“I read the information Apple put out yesterday and I'm concerned. I think this is the wrong approach and a setback for people's privacy all over the world,” tweeted WhatsApp head Will Cathcart.Apple said it will use a perceptual hashing tool, called NeuralHash, that analyses an image and maps it into unique numbers. The system then performs on-device matching using a database of known image hashes of child sexual abuse provided by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and other child-safety organisations. In case a match is found, the image will be manually reviewed and upon confirmation, the user’s account will be disabled and NCMEC will be notified.Also Read | 'Epic is right': Elon Musk slams Apple's app store feesCathcart assured that WhatsApp, which has repeatedly been prompting Indian users to adopt its controversial privacy policy, will not adopt Apple’s approach to combat child sexual abuse. In a series of tweets, he said that WhatsApp reported more than 400,000 cases of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) to NCMEC in 2020 without breaking encryption.There are so many problems with this approach, and it’s troubling to see them act without engaging experts that have long documented their technical and broader concerns with this.WhatsApp chief blasted Apple for using a software that can scan all the private photos on a phone instead of focusing on making it easy for users to report such content shared with them. He raised concerns over the use of the scanning tool in countries like China where laws are broad and vague for considering content illegal.“This is an Apple built and operated surveillance system that could very easily be used to scan private content for anything they or a government decides it wants to control. Countries where iPhones are sold will have different definitions on what is acceptable,” Cathcart added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/setback-for-privacy-whatsapp-on-apple-s-plan-to-scan-iphones-for-images-of-child-abuse-101628333434416.html

There were no reports of casualties in Israel or Gaza.There was no immediate comment from Hamas.Israeli media reported that four fires caused by incendiary balloons broke out Friday afternoon in areas close to the Gaza Strip.The launch of the balloons comes over two months after an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas, the fourth since the militant group seized power in Gaza in 2007.Hamas is upset that Israel has done little to ease a crippling blockade on the territory since the fighting ended and appears to be using incendiary balloons as a pressure tactic. Israel's new prime minister, Naftali Bennet, has compared the balloon launches to rocket fire.Israel and Egypt maintain a blockade of Gaza that includes Israeli control over the territory's coast and airspace and restrictions on the movement of people and goods in and out of the territory. Israel says the closure is needed to prevent Hamas from arming while critics say that the measures amount to collective punishment.

The insult was part of a live broadcast shared on Bolsonaro's Facebook account but later deleted. Copies continue to be shared on social media.Bolsonaro has railed for weeks against the electronic urns used in Brazil and pushed for the adoption of printed receipts that can be counted if an election result is disputed.Critics say Bolsonaro, like former U.S. President Donald Trump, is sowing doubts in case he loses next year's presidential election. He has threatened not to accept the result if the system is not changed.With his popularity falling after overseeing the world's second-highest Covid-19 death toll, opinion polls show Bolsonaro trails former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, though neither of them has officially announced they will run.Earlier this week the Supreme Court approved an investigation into the president's unfounded accusations about voter fraud.On Thursday, in Bolsonaro's worst setback in Congress since taking office in 2019, a committee voted to shelve a constitutional amendment he has been pushing that would have adopted printed ballots.Earlier on Friday, Senate President Rodrigo Pacheco criticized Bolsonaro for his attacks on the Supreme Court and offered to mediate, saying the president's insults were unacceptable.Pacheco said Bolsonaro must respect the results of next year's election even if he fails to change the all-electronic voting system - which the president groundlessly claims is vulnerable to tampering."Any threat, however slight, to this democracy will be promptly rejected by the Senate," Pacheco said in a GloboNews television interview.The Senate head said anyone advocating a "democratic retreat" or the suspension of next year's elections would be seen as an "enemy of the nation.""I think a majority in Congress at this moment want to maintain the electronic voting system," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazils-president-clashes-with-judiciary-taunts-top-judge-report-101628320033900.html
07-08-2021||World||Teen diving sensation is now China’s darling||The emerging backstory of Olympic diving champion Quan Hongchan, 14, and her disarming candour after winning the gold medal is being hailed as both inspiring and endearing.China’s youngest athlete at the Tokyo Games, Quan scorched the scoresheet in the individual 10m platform final on Thursday, drowning the competition with three perfect 10s for an overall score of 466.20, which is being described as sensational.Barely into diving for seven years and a relative unknown until Thursday, the teenager is now a household name in China - her story is already the stuff of Chinese sporting legends.Quan is likely to be showered with gifts, money, free passes to zoos and amusement parks - neither of which she has visited until now - and lifetime supplies of her favourite “Latiao”, a local spicy snack in China made of wheat flour and chilli.Quan is from a farmer’s family in a town in south China’s economic powerhouse, Guangdong province.Reports on her in Chinese domestic and social media - where the teenager, unlike in the pool, has made quite a splash in the past couple of days - say that she was discovered by a talent scout while practising diving at school in 2014.If her dives won the medal, her post-win media interaction won hearts. “It seems there is no difference between the Olympics and national competitions. My coach told me to relax and don’t be nervous before the Games,” she was quoted as saying by the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post (SCMP) at the post-win media interaction in Tokyo.The inspiration behind her impulse to dive, as it turns out, wasn’t exactly lofty - she wanted to bunk school. “I feel like I was cheated into starting diving. It’s mainly because I don’t like to go to school, and my grades are poor, but it feels good to dive,” Quan said.When asked about her secrets in being able to dive literally without a ripple on the water, Quan said: “I don’t know, I haven’t compared myself to dumplings!”What broke the Chinese internet and possibly millions of hearts was when Quan spoke about her ill mother, dedicating the win to her. “My mother has been in hospital several times,” Quan told The Paper, a Chinese digital newspaper. “The treatment costs a lot. I feel like I have to earn money to send it home to mom. Mom is ill. I want to make a lot of money, to treat her, and cure her completely.”Quan is likely to get substantial support from Chinese netizens in her endeavour.Interestingly, her compatriot Chen Yuxi who won the silver in the same event is only 15.Australia’s Melissa Wu, 29, whose father is of Chinese origin, took the bronze in the event. Wu, in fact, had won the silver medal for synchronised diving at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/teen-diving-sensation-is-now-china-s-darling-101628320203853.html

The agency also cautioned that increasing Xenophobia in neighbouring countries and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has been forcing many Afghan refugees to return home. "Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 1.5 million people have been deported from, or opted to leave, neighbouring Pakistan and Iran to return to Afghanistan,” IOM stated.The UN agency has been supporting the returnees who are in dire need of sustenance and shelter as they have spent their very last penny to pay for transportation costs to be able to return home. “IOM will ensure we are prepared for a continued deterioration in the humanitarian situation”, said the agency’s Afghanistan chief Stuart Simpson.Don’t trust the Taliban, says Afghan envoy to China"Now is not the time to turn a blind eye to Afghanistan's critical situation. International attention and advocacy is urgently needed to convey the suffering of Afghan civilians to the world. A negotiated ceasefire remains the best solution for Afghanistan's civilian population to stay safe and potentially create the conditions for improved service delivery and the access required to reach vulnerable persons with care and assistance," Simpson added.Taliban have been waging war in major Afghan cities as US troops prepare for their final leg of withdrawal. Taliban insurgents captured the provincial capital of Zaranj and assassinated the government's senior media officer, Dawa Khan Menapal, in Kabul on Friday. Menapal’s death comes within a month of Reuters photojournalist Danish Siddiqui’s death at Spin Boldak region while on assignment with the Afghan defence forces. Taliban fighters have been laying siege to provincial capitals in the south and west of the country after seizing several key border crossings. The UN envoy for Afghanistan Deborah Lyons told the UN Security Council on Friday that the Taliban’s fighting is taking a “distressing human toll”, with at least 104 civilians killed and 403 wounded in fighting to take Laskhar Gah, the capital of Helmand province since July 28; and more than 460 civilian casualties registered in Kandahar since the start of the offensive there on July 9.The country is also reeling from a severe drought and intense humanitarian crisis. The UN estimates around 18.5 million people, almost half the country’s population, will be in need of humanitarian assistance this year to cope with the ongoing multifaceted crisis, caused by conflict, a global pandemic, and widespread under-development and poverty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-3-lakh-afghans-internally-displaced-due-to-conflict-says-un-report-101628318797997.html

Cases bottomed out in June but took about six weeks to go back above 100,000, despite a vaccine that has been given to more than 70% of the adult population.The virus is spreading quickly through unvaccinated populations, especially in the South where hospitals have been overrun with patients.Health officials are fearful that cases will continue to soar if more Americans don’t embrace the vaccine.“Our models show that if we don’t (vaccinate people), we could be up to several hundred thousand cases a day, similar to our surge in early January,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Rochelle Walensky said on CNN this week.The number of Americans hospitalized with the virus has also skyrocketed and it has gotten so bad that many hospitals are scrambling to find beds for patients in far-off locations.Houston officials say the latest wave of Covid-19 cases is pushing the local health care system to nearly “a breaking point,” resulting in some patients having to be transferred out of the city to get medical care, including one who had to be taken to North Dakota.Dr. David Persse, who is health authority for the Houston Health Department and EMS medical director, said some ambulances were waiting hours to offload patients at Houston area hospitals because no beds were available. Persse said he feared this would lead to prolonged respond times to 911 medical calls.“The health care system right now is nearly at a breaking point ... For the next three weeks or so, I see no relief on what’s happening in emergency departments,” Persse said Thursday.Last weekend, a patient in Houston had to be transferred to North Dakota to get medical care. An 11-month-old girl with Covid-19 and who was having seizures had to be transported on Thursday from Houston to a hospital 170 miles (274 kilometers) away in Temple.In Missouri, 30 ambulances and more than 60 medical personnel will be stationed across the state to help transport Covid-19 patients to other regions if nearby hospitals are too full to admit them, Missouri Gov. Mike Parson announced Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-now-averaging-100-000-new-covid-19-infections-a-day-101628316393561.html

Pakistan, meanwhile, continues to play on both sides and the western powers led by the US have no definite plan to tackle the military occupation of Afghanistan by the Pakistan supported fundamentalist force. The military flux situation has led to foreign terrorists from Pakistan, Xinjiang and Uzbekistan migrating to the Taliban held territories in east and north Afghanistan and it is only a matter of time when these terrorist groups start targeting democracies under the protection of the Sunni medieval force. Till Friday, 218 districts in Afghanistan are under the control of Taliban, while the national government holds 120. The number of contested districts stands at 99.Ground intelligence reports reaching Delhi indicate that the Taliban have issued a fatwa in Badakhshan, Takhar and Ghazni provinces that girls above the age of 12 and widows can be taken by their fighters. They are also targeting families of security forces, conducting house-to-house searches and looting properties. Foreign terrorists are freely operating under the Taliban umbrella, including those affiliated to Al Qaeda, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, East Turkestan Islamic Movement and Islamic Movement of Uzebkistan. A 21-year-old woman was dragged out of her car at Balkh district centre and killed by Taliban fighters for not wearing a burqa (veil).Neighbouring Pakistan, meanwhile, has adopted a two-pronged strategy. It is part of an US/UK effort to invite Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on a state visit to Islamabad ostensibly to talk peace with senior Taliban leaders like first Deputy Emir Mullah Yaqub (son of Mullah Omar) and Haqqani network chief Sirajuddin Haqqani, who is also the sword arm of Taliban. At the same time, Pakistani drones are in action in Jalalabad and in Nangarhar province conducting reconnaissance and watching the live action on ground.With a thankless task of stablising Afghanistan, the US has set up a Security Defence Cooperation Management Office in Qatar to support the Afghan security forces. Preparing for a worst case scenario, Washington has also advised Afghan leaders to present a united front in defence of the country's government, gain public trust and take the peace process forward. The envisaged platform would include HCNR chairman Abdullah Abdullah, Hazara leader Ustad Mohammad Mohaqiq and former Mujahideen leaders Ustad Abdul Rab Rasoul Sayyaf, Ismail Khan, Atta Mohammed Noort, Younis Qanooni, Uzbek leaders Enayatullah Babur and Batur Dostum, sone of Rashid Dostum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-enforce-sharia-in-ghazni-pak-plays-double-and-afghanistan-in-flux-101628315004180.html

Anyone was fine, I just wanted to kill a lot of people."Other media, including broadcaster NHK, reported similar quotes from suspect.A police spokesman said they had nothing further to share on the details of case when asked about the media reports on Saturday.Violent crime is rare in Japan but there have been a spate of knife attacks by assailants unknown to the victims.In June 2008, a man in a light truck drove into a crowd in the popular Akihabara district and then jumped out of the vehicle and started stabbing pedestrians, leaving seven dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/knife-attacker-on-tokyo-commuter-train-wanted-kill-women-who-looked-happy-101628313200483.html

According to the outlet Global News, there have been 206 such cases reported in Canada, a small fraction of the number of doses of the vaccine administered in the country.Health Canada added that the vaccine label for the other mRNA vaccine authorised in the country, manufactured by Moderna, “already contains safety information” about this possible outcome and that it is “continuing to assess this issue for all authorised Covid-19 vaccines in Canada”.Bell’s Palsy, it noted, is an episode of facial muscle weakness or paralysis and the condition is typically temporary. Symptoms appear suddenly and generally start to improve after a few weeks. The exact cause is unknown. It’s believed to be the result of swelling and inflammation of the nerve that controls muscles on one side of the patient’s face.Despite these adverse events, it stressed that Covid-19 “vaccines continue to be safe and effective” and their benefits “continue to outweigh their potential risks”.In fact, the number of cases reported of adverse reactions to all vaccines approved in the country is tiny. According to data from the Public Health Agency of Canada of the total 11,471 individual reports of reactions, 8,622 were considered non-serious while 2,849 were considered serious but comprised just 0.006% of all doses administered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizerbiontech-covid-vaccine-canada-issues-advisory-on-adverse-reaction-101628312223281.html

The IHME’s forecasts distinguish between officially reported Covid-19 deaths and excess deaths attributed to the illness including unreported fatalities.There have been almost 4.3 million deaths from Covid-19 globally since the start of the pandemic, according to the World Health Organization.The delta variant is associated with viral loads that are more than 1,200 times higher in newly infected individuals compared with the original coronavirus strain, which means that delta can spread as easily as chickenpox. Studies from the U.K. have also shown that delta, which was discovered in India in October, is more resistant to vaccines than the alpha variant that emerged in England in late 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-covid-deaths-estimated-to-reach-5-3-million-by-december-101628305623388.html

But after peaking in April, the rate of people getting vaccinated each day fell off sharply.This aggressive vaccination program had raised hopes of a return to some semblance of normal life this summer, but in the end, this did not pan out because of the Delta variant.Daily new cases, deaths, and hospitalizations are up sharply in recent weeks, and cities like New York and Los Angeles are imposing new restrictions such as demanding proof of vaccination for entering indoor venues like restaurants and gyms.Last week there was an average of 90,000 new coronavirus cases per day. Florida and Texas accounted for a third of them, the White House said.For four straight weeks, the average number of people getting vaccinated each day has risen, White House Covid-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/half-of-us-population-now-fully-vaccinated-against-covid-19-white-house-101628301581312.html

The killing of one of the government’s leading voices follows a bloody day of fighting in Afghanistan.In another major blow for the Afghan government, a police spokesman in southern Nimroz province said the capital Zaranj has fallen to the insurgents.“The savage terrorists have committed a cowardly act once again and martyred a patriotic Afghan,” interior ministry spokesman Mirwais Stanikzai said of the death of Dawa Khan Menapal. Menapal used to openly slam the Taliban.The Taliban claimed responsibility for the death, with spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid saying the killing was a “special attack carried out by the mujahideen”.Fighting in Afghanistan has intensified since May, when foreign forces began the final stage of a withdrawal.Taliban capture first provincial capitalThe Taliban on Friday captured their first provincial capital since launching an offensive to coincide with the departure of foreign troops, a major blow to an Afghan government desperately trying to push back the insurgents. “Zaranj, provincial capital of Nimroz, has fallen to the Taliban,” Roh Gul Khairzad, the deputy governor of Nimroz, told AFP.

The 61-year-old leader was elected by the Karnataka BJP legislature party as its new leader to succeed outgoing chief minister BS Yediyurappa.While the CM kept the key portfolios of finance, Bengaluru development and cabinet affairs, debutant ministers secured plum portfolios -- Araga Jnanendra (home), V Sunil Kumar (energy, Kannada and culture) and BC Nagesh (primary and secondary education, and Sakala department).Significantly, defectors from the Congress and the Janata Dal Secular (JDS) in 2019, have retained their portfolios -- K Sudhakar (health and family welfare), BC Patil (agriculture), ST Somashekar (cooperation), Byrati Basavaraj (urban development), K Gopalaiah (excise), and Shivaram Hebbar (labour) retained the posts. However, two of the leaders — Srimant Patil and R Shankar — did not make it to the cabinet, but have been promised other posts, said BJP officer-bearers in the know of the developments.Five of the ministers in the previous cabinet -- Govind Karjola, B Sriramulu, CC Patil, Murugesh R. Nirani, and Shahikala Jolle -- have been allocated new portfolios, while another five -- V Somanna, Umesh V Katti, JC Madhuswamy, Anand Singh, and N Nagaraju (MTB) -- have been allocated additional ones.Lone woman minister in the cabinet, Shashikala Jolle, has been made in-charge of Muzrai, Wakf & Haj. She was women & child development minister in the Yediyurappa cabinet and had faced corruption allegations.The portfolio allocation has also given rise to some amount of disgruntlement, with ministers Anand Singh and Nagaraju openly expressing their displeasure. Singh, who has been allocated ecology, environment, and tourism portfolios, said: “I didn’t ask for this portfolio. Whatever request I made at the party forum has not been considered. I’m planning to meet the CM. I will request him to reconsider my request.” Nagaraju, who defected from the Congress to the BJP, has threatened to take serious action if his portfolio is not changed. He has retained the municipal administration portfolio, but has been given the additional charge of Small Scale Industries and Public Sector Industries.“Previous CM BSY and present CM Basavaraj Bommai have not kept their word. I am not happy with the allotted portfolio. Will take a call in this regard in 2-3 days,” he said in a Twitter post. Downplaying the disgruntlement among his cabinet colleagues, the chief minister said he will speak to them and sort out the issue. “I will call and talk to him. He is my good friend.” Later speaking to reporters in Hubballi, in response to a question on the portfolio Singh desired, the CM said, “Naturally everyone will have desire (for certain Ministries), it cannot be made public...everyone can’t get the portfolio they ask for.I will talk to him.” On giving key posts to debutants, Bommai said, it is with an intention to bring in new changes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/18-of-29-k-taka-ministers-retain-portfolios-bsy-s-cabinet-rank-facilities-remain-101628359987975.html
07-08-2021||India||Surge in Covid-19 cases adds to Kerala’s financial woes||Amid the high number of Covid-19 cases, frequent lockdowns and stringent regulations, signs of fatigue and weariness are visible on the tottering economy of Kerala. Whether it is the fatality rate, vaccination, tracking and testing and surveillance the state is way ahead but its daily caseload is quite high and the test positivity rate has remained in double digits for more than a month baffling experts. Kerala is grappling with an unusual situation-- it is struggling to strike a balance between saving lives and protecting livelihoods. The situation is complex in some of the densely-populated districts like Malappuram where the average TPR is above15 per cent. The state is also witnessing a spate of suicides—a majority are small-time traders and farmers. Desperation is quite visible as Covid-19 cases continue to rise and many say the government’s packages are cosmetic in nature. “My kidney and liver are intact. They are up for sale,” a street vendor put up a board recently in Thiruvananthapuram and a bus owner pasted a notice on his stationary bus that it is for sale for scrap in Kozhikode-- such scenes are not rare in Kerala these days. In the last two months the state witnessed more than 30 Covid-19 induced suicides. ‘On sale’ boards before shops are a regular sight. Two days ago the government was forced to take a re-look at its pandemic control measures as cases went up manifold and the Centre also started demanding answers. But these measures aggravated the crisis rather than solving it, the ground situation shows. “How long do we have to suffer like this?” This is the most heard question in markets, tourist spots and other places. And nobody has any answer to offer. According to new regulations, shoppers and employees at shops and malls will have to show their Covid-19 certificates and many agitated traders have threatened to close down their establishments. “We can’t remain lax now. We have taken strict measures in view of a possible third wave,” said state health minister Veena Geroge justifying the recent regulations. “We expected a soothing balm from the government but we got brickbats. Many traders have committed suicide. If the situation remains like this you can count on more suicides,” said merchants’ association leader T Nasaruddin blaming the government. “The government is not pragmatic in its approach. It goes by the advice tendered by bureaucrats. Its ears are not on the ground,” said opposition leader V D Satheesan criticising the government’s knee-jerk reactions. On Saturday, the state recorded another spike reporting 20,367 new Covid-19 cases with a test positivity rate of 13.35% after 1,51,523 samples were tested, according to the data released by the health ministry. It also reported 139 deaths taking the total number of fatalities to 17,654. In the last 24 hours, the country reported 38,628 cases-- the state’s share is more than 60%. And the countrywide TPR is 2.21 per cent. Out of 4,12, 153 active cases the state’s share is 1,78, 166. “Going by the case trajectory it will take two more weeks for cases to subside in the state,” said a medical expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surge-in-covid-19-cases-adds-to-kerala-s-financial-woes-101628352667279.html

07-08-2021||India||In Karnataka, 18 ministers retain portfolios from earlier Yediyurappa cabinet||Three days after they were sworn in, the 29 cabinet ministers in Karnataka got their portfolios. Eighteen ministers in the Basavaraj Bommai cabinet have retained the portfolios they held in the Yediyurappa government. In a significant move, ministers who had defected from the Congress and JDS two years ago to facilitate the BJP retained their previous portfolios. Ministers K Sudhakar (health and Family Welfare), BC Patil (Agriculture), ST Somashekar (Cooperation), Byrati Basavaraj (Urban Development), K Gopalaiah (Excise), and Shivaram Hebbar (Labour) retained their posts, even though there were concerns about them losing their portfolios in the new government. Two of the defectors— Srimant Patil and R Shankar —did not make it to the Bommai cabinet. Both leaders have been promised other posts. First time minister Araga Jnanendra was appointed as the Home Minister, the portfolio held by Bommai in the previous government. Another first-time minister V Sunil Kumar has been allocated Energy and Kannada Culture department, while BC Nagesh, who is also a first-time minister, has been allocated Primary and Secondary, and Sakala, portfolios. Five ministers have lost the old portfolios they held in the previous government and have been allocated new portfolios. These ministers are Govind Karjola, B Sriramulu, CC Patil, Murugesh R. Nirani, and Shahikala Jolle. Five Ministers -- V Somanna, Umesh V. Katti, J.C. Madhuswamy, Anand Singh, and N. Nagaraju (MTB) -- have been allocated additional portfolios. Some ministers have expressed displeasure over the portfolio allocations. Anand Singh, who has been given Ecology, Environment, and Tourism portfolios, said he would be meeting the Chief Minister. “I didn’t ask for this portfolio. Whatever request I made at the party forum has not been considered. I’m planning to meet the CM. I will request him to reconsider,” said Singh. Another minister and turncoat MTB Nagaraj has threatened to take serious action if his portfolio is not changed.

The Uttar Pradesh Police have finally solved the case and three men have been arrested from Bareilly.According to the UP police, Tarun Varshney, the victim, received a mail on January 8, 2019, from some 'Advocate Bruise Eddie'. In that mail, he was informed about the death of some Braj Varshney, who apparently died in a car accident in London in 2015. Braj Varshney had 12.5 million pound which, as the mail said, would be given to Noida's Tarun Varshney because the gotra matched. The email said that he was chosen because of his surname. About 50 per cent of the money would go to advocate Eddie, who apparently sent the mail.After this first email in 2019, Tarun Varshney started receiving several emails from IDs like United Kingdom attorney, Netix Bank London, asking him to complete the formalities to get the wealth. So far, he was not asked for any money, Police said, explaining how the fraud took place.Then Tarun Varshney received a mail confirming that the money has been transferred to the Reserve Bank of India and he was asked to pay customs duty registry service, legal heir charge, foreign currency exchange etc. These mails came from an ID that claimed to be of the foreign currency exchange department of Dehradun. These miscellaneous charges amounted to ₹60 lakh which the engineer paid to 25 different bank accounts.The investigation of Noida's cybercrime department led the probe to Bareilly where the conning racket was busted and Akeeluddin, Anees Ahmed and Asleem Khan were arrested. The trio has been running this racket for the past two years. Those 25 bank accounts, belonging to them, have been frozen with ₹13 lakh remaining in those accounts, police said.(With PTI Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chosen-for-gotra-noida-techie-duped-of-rs-60-lakh-on-email-promise-of-12-5-million-pound-inheritance-101628339514539.html

The technology will be tested on the Diesel Electric Multiple Unit (DEMU) on the Sonipat-Jind section of the Northern Railway, the ministry noted in its statement.“The retrofitting of diesel-powered DEMU and converting it into hydrogen fuel-powered train set will not only save the cost to the tune of ₹2.3 crore per year by converting from diesel to hydrogen, but will also save carbon footprint worth 11.12 kilo tonnes per annum and particulate matter worth 0.72 kilo tonnes per annum,” the statement read. It further said that once this pilot project is implemented successfully, hydrogen fuel can be used to run all the rolling stock which is scheduled to operate on diesel fuel after electrification.The project will initially see two DEMU rakes being converted based on hydrogen fuel cell power moment. Later, two hybrid narrow gauge locos will be converted as well. Once the conversion is done, the train will be powered by hydrogen fuel. “The bidding for hydrogen fuel cell-based DEMU will begin on September 21 and close on October 5. A pre-bid press conference will take place on August 17,” the statement informed. Hydrogen fuel, it said, is the greenest mode of transport as hydrogen can be produced by eletrolysing water from solar energy.According to the Railways ministry, very few countries are currently using this technique. One rake is currently undergoing trials in Germany while officials in Poland, too, are separately testing this technology on a rake, the ministry said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-invites-bids-for-hydrogen-fuel-based-technology-for-diesel-run-trains-101628337614663.html

It was a slip of the tongue which Roy realised as soon as he uttered the words and clarifying he said that he actually meant Trinamool."The BJP will win convincingly in the assembly by-polls. It will win in Tripura. There is not an iota of doubt in that," Roy who was with the BJP for four years said. "The 'Maa Mati Manush' party (TMC) will remain the winner here and open its account in Tripura as well. BJP will be nowhere in the state. They will be decimated. Mamata Banerjee will continue to helm Bengal," he said as he rectified himself.Seven assembly seats in West Bengal are slated to go to by-elections including the Bhabanipur constituency which Mamata will have to win to retain her chief minister's post as in the assembly election, she lost Nandigram to BJP's Suvendu Adhikari.While the BJP leaders have pounced on the opportunity and said that Roy had unwittingly blurted out the truth, his son Subhrangshu Roy, who also made a comeback to TMC along with his father, said that his mistake has been blown out of proportion. Expressing concern over Mukul Roy's health, Subhrangshu said his father has been forgetting things since his wife's death. Mukul Roy's wife died in July in a private hospital in Chennai after suffering a heart attack. She had recovered from Covid but was suffering from post-Covid complications.After that, Mukul Roy has been diagnosed with depression and a chemical imbalance in the body, Subhrangshu said to a news channel.Apart from the by-elections in the state, Trinamool Congress is also gearing up for elections in Tripura for which Prashant Kishor's I-PAC has been camping in the state."Mukulda has betrayed his voters in Krishnanagar North. He has lost his credibility. But he has spoken the truth. The truth has perhaps come from his mouth as he is under tremendous mental stress," BJP spokesman Shamik Bhattacharya said, as quoted by PTI.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mukul-roy-says-bjp-will-win-corrects-it-son-explains-faux-pas-101628320088195.html
07-08-2021||India||10 things to know about Covid-19 R-value in India and its states||Reproduction or reproductive number, known as the R-value of Covid, has become a closely followed measurement across the world and in India. It is a scientific concept which is the average number of new infections generated by one infected individual during the entire infectious period. One infected person is able to spread the SARS-CoV-2 infection to over 200 persons, but R factor is the real number of how many people are being infected from one affected person. The Union health ministry this week raised alarm over the R factor of eight states which are more than the national average.Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru have Covid R-value over 1, reveals study. What it means10 things to know about R-value and what in an increasing trend of R-value1. India's R-value, according to the health ministry data published this week, is 1.2. This means 100 infected people in India are infecting around 120 people.2. As it is a mathematical concept, the value is dynamic. It reflects changes every week.3. R-value of 1 and below is considered safe as that means that 100 people are infecting either the same number of people or less. This is an indication that the number of new infections is not more than the number of existing infections.4. The United States, Canada, Australia also have an R-value of 1.2 which explains why there is a global rise in the number of new Covid infections, which is being seen as the tip of a fresh wave.5. According to health ministry data, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Lakshadweep, Tamil Nadu, Mizoram, Karnataka, Puducherry and Kerala have high reproductive numbers.6. Nagaland, Meghalaya, Haryana, Goa, Jharkhand, Delhi, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra have a reproductive value of 1.7. States which are reporting a higher R-value are also reporting an increasing trend that is the transmission of the infection to more and more people are taking place at a fast rate.8. Decreasing trend suggests that though the R-value might be 1, the potency of transmission from one infected person to another is slowing down. This may happen if there are local restrictions, Covid appropriate behaviour etc.9. For example, Maharashtra and Delhi both have an R-value of 1. But in Maharashtra, it showed decreasing trend, while in Delhi, it was stable.10. The transmission and its rate is crucial to indicate the rise and fall of a wave. It also indicated the chances of mutation of a strain as the more transmission happens, the virus gets more chances to mutate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/increasing-trend-in-covid-r-value-what-does-it-mean-10-things-to-know-101628314414913.html

The cessation of the container service has triggered fear of disruptions in industrial and manufacturing activities in Goa due to increased export and import costs involved in use of other ports.“Container Agent M/s Maersk Line had declared to its customers to stop taking container bookings from MPT Goa. On further enquiry it was learnt that the only container feeder vessel operator from MPT Goa, M/s Sima Marine will discontinue the container vessel’s call at MPT Goa,” MPT said in a statement.The MPT, among other benefits, is offering 100% concession on vessel related charges (VRC) including pilotage, port dues and berth hire as an inaugural discount for the new operator’s first call, and 50% concession on VRC from the second call onwards, besides also promising priority ousting with 24-hour’s notice unlike the 48-hours ousting notice needed currently and 50% concession on the ousting charge.“Based on discussion with all stakeholders and after identifying the key barriers for the feeder operators and container agents, a decision was taken to grant substantial discounts to any new feeder operator commencing the service at MPT Goa. Some additional discounts were also agreed to for the container vessels for the next three months for the sea food export season,” the Port said in a statement.The concessions will be reviewed further after the first three months of the fishing export season.The Port has received interest from global shipping container company MSC India that seeks to start a container feeder service for its own export-import container business.Owing to the low volumes of containers handled at the port, Goa’s Mormugao Port relies on a feeder service to larger ports like Mumbai, where they are then loaded on to larger container vessels and shipped out.“This issue cannot be addressed only by the port but is also for the industry association and trade chambers in Goa to reflect upon. Apart from the adequate volume challenge, there is also a need for a reliable and efficient shore crane (Harbour Mobile Crane) at MPT Goa. The port has decided to address this issue in a short time frame probably through the Sagarmala funding route or any other suitable means,” said the Mormugao Port.The Port has, however, cautioned that the discounts alone will not lure container operators. “The only way to guarantee a regular and sustainable container service at Goa is by giving the operator a substantial volume, at least to a level that lends critical mass and then no container line or vessel operator will ignore Goa for container trade and abruptly stop the service.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goas-mormugao-port-slashes-charges-to-promote-container-service-101628312823313.html

The tweet that showed a picture of Gandhi meeting the family members of minor girl showed as 'no longer available' on the microblogging website for violating its rules. A click on the tweet led to a message that read: "This tweet violated the Twitter rules."Posting a picture of his meeting with the minor's family earlier on Wednesday, Gandhi had tweeted in Hindi: "Parents' tears are saying only one thing -- their daughter, the daughter of this country, deserves justice. And I am with them on this path to justice."The action from Twitter comes after the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) had asked the Delhi Police and the microblogging site to take action over Gandhi posting the photo of the girl's family. The commission said that it violates the Juvenile Justice Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.NCPCR chairperson Priyank Kanoongo in a tweet said that the child rights body took action after taking cognisance of reports which said that the Congress leader “sabotaged” the identity of the minor rape victim by posting the photograph of her parents on the microblogging site.Gandhi met the minor girl's family members earlier on Wednesday and asserted them that he is with them on the path to justice and "will not back down even an inch".Meanwhile, a Delhi-based lawyer Vineet Jindal ha filed a complaint in Delhi Police against Gandhi for allegedly disclosing the rape victim's identity, reports news agency ANI.In his complaint, Jindal stated that Gandhi from his Twitter handle @RahulGandhi shared his own photo along with the parents of the victim, which becomes discloser of the identity of the minor girl.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-takes-down-rahul-gandhi-s-tweet-that-disclosed-rape-victim-s-identity-101628310218629.html
07-08-2021||India||'Multifaceted genius': Rabindranath Tagore remembered on his 80th death anniversary||India marks the 80th death anniversary of the great Bengali polymath Rabindranath Tagore on August 7, a date which is known in West Bengal and Bangladesh as 'Baishe Srabon', solemnly marking the day when the poet and playwright passed away. Tagore, the first non-European person to win a Nobel Prize in Literature, was known for reshaping the structural framework of Bengali literature and music, along with other Indian art forms with the advent of modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.Tagore not only composed India's national anthem "Jana Gana Mana" but also composed Bangladesh's "Amar Shonar Bangla" anthem. In addition to that, he is also believed to have inspired the national anthem of Sri Lanka.On Tagore's 80th death anniversary, the nation's leaders took to their official handles on Twitter to observe the day with solemn remembrance.My respectful tributes to the poet extraordinaire, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore on his Punya Tithi today. He was a multifaceted genius- a philosopher, social reformer, educationist, playwright, painter & composer. #RabindranathTagore pic.twitter.com/JBAGjPgHSeRemembering India's great thinker and idealist Rabindranath Tagore Ji on his death anniversary. A true patriot whose contribution in art, literature and as a social reformer will continue to inspire the coming generations. pic.twitter.com/p6Bc7vSVFiMy humble tribute to Nobel laureate, polymath, and composer of our National Anthem Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore on his death anniversary. He would continue to inspire generations through his enduring literary masterpieces. pic.twitter.com/fWTNxIJR9eRabindranath Tagore was born to Debendranath Tagore and Sarada Devi on May 7, 1861, in the Jorasanko mansion of Calcutta. He lost his mother at the young age of 14, later travelling across India with his father. On returning, Tagore completed a set of major works by 1877, one of them being a long poem in the Maithili style of Vidyapati.Tagore, at the age of 17, enrolled at a public school at Brighton in East Sussex, England. He briefly studied law at University College London, but again left school. It was then that he started studying the works of William Shakespeare and was inspired by English, Irish, and Scottish folk tunes. Wanting to reconcile European novelty with Bengali traditions, Tagore returned to his homeland in 1880 and continued his literary career.In 1913, Tagore was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his translated work of poetry, 'Gitanjali: Song Offerings', published a year prior. He was also awarded a knighthood by King George V in 1915, but the poet later renounced it following the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.A combination of Tagore's life experiences gave us the gift of his immense talent in poetry, prose, songwriting, and art. From mystical romanticism to patriotism, Rabindranath Tagore left no stone unturned in the realm of artistic expression.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/multifaceted-genius-rabindranath-tagore-remembered-on-his-80th-death-anniversary-101628308489685.html

A search operation has been launched,” said an official.A grenade is suspected to have been lobbed at a construction site of MG Construction Company at Gund in Banihal at 11.15 pm on Friday night resulting in minor injuries to a boy and an employee. They were admitted to the sub-district hospital in Banihal, the official quoted above added.The injured were identified as Gopal Sharma, 35, son of Rattan Lal of Udhampur and 16-year old Mohammad Aquib, who was standing outside a nearby Madarsa where he studied, when the blast took place.An under-construction office of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) district president Mohammed Salim Bhat and the Madrasa were also close to the area of explosion, resulting in the window panes of the Madrasa getting damaged, officials said.Soon after the incident, Ramban’s police chief PD Nitya (SSP), sub-divisional police officer (SDPO), sub divisional magistrate (SDM) and others reached the spot and a joint search operation was launched by the police, military and paramilitary forces.According to people aware of the developments, eyewitnesses said they heard a stone-like object fall on the shed of the company building before the blast.The SSP said a thorough probe will be conducted before arriving at any conclusions.“A mysterious explosion took place.

07-08-2021||India||Odisha farmer dies by suicide over loan burden, failed crop||A 45-year-old farmer in western Odisha district of Sambalpur died on Friday, two days after he consumed insecticide, allegedly due to crop failure and his poor harvest selling for very low price, said his family.45-year-old Kaibalya Rohidas, a farmer at Kudagunderpur village of Sambalpur district was under severe mental stress due to the losses he had suffered following crop failure. “My father produced two quintal paddy in the last Rabi season, but he could sell only 45 kg of his produce at [the] Minimum Selling Price (MSP). He suffered a huge loss amounting to ₹1.5 lakh as he had to sell the remaining paddy stock at a very cheap price, causing him huge mental distress,” alleged his son Dasarath Rohidas.The son said his father’s stress was compounded since he had to return an outstanding loan of at least ₹72,000 taken from a cooperative society to buy a power tiller.Following the farmer’s death, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA from Kuchinda, Nauri Nayak, visited the Rohidas family and assured that his loan will be waived-off and the family will be paid an ex-gratia of at least ₹10 lakh.“Many farmers suffered crop losses this season due to unexpected rains. Many farmers had to resort to distress selling of paddy. Kaibalya may have taken the extreme step under mental stress,” said Nayak.Dhankauda’s block development officer (BDO) Basant Hati said the farmer’s death will be inquired into to establish the exact reason.In February this year, a 50-year-old farmer from coastal Bhadrak district died by suicide after being pressurised by a non-banking finance company and a self help group that had loaned ₹50,000 to his family. The farmer’s family could not repay the loan due to the economic stress caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Last year, Odisha agriculture minister Arun Sahoo told the state Assmebly that 38 farmers had died by suicide in the state between 2016 and 2019. While 16 farmers ended their lives in 2016-17, 20 took the extreme step in 2017-18 and two in 2018-19. There is no government report on the number of farmer suicides in 2019-20 and 2020-21.The National Crime Record Bureau, which for the first time in 2014 published the statistics for farmer suicides, had said that bankruptcy or indebtedness and family problems were major causes of suicides among male farmers. In case of female farmers’ suicides, farming-related issues were the main cause followed by family problems and marriage-related issues, it had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-farmer-dies-by-suicide-over-loan-burden-failed-crop-101628304302829.html
07-08-2021||India||PM Modi tells heads of Indian missions to ensure local goes global||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said the government’s decision to get rid of retrospective taxation reflects India’s commitment to deliver on promises and sends a clear message to all investors about the opening up of new possibilities. Addressing a virtual meeting with heads of Indian missions and other stakeholders from the trade and commerce sector, Modi urged officials to take advantage of new opportunities created by changes in global supply chains in the post-Covid-19 era. The meeting, the first of its kind, was joined by commerce minister Piyush Goyal and external affairs minister S Jaishankar. The theme for the meeting, as outlined by Modi, was “Local goes global – Make in India for the world”. Referring to the importance of stability in doing business, he said the decision by India to get rid of retrospective taxation shows the government’s commitment and consistency in policies. “It sends a clear message to all investors that, moving forward, India is not only opening doors to new possibilities but the decisive government of India has the will to fulfil its promises,” he said. The government on Thursday introduced a Bill in Lok Sabha to prevent the income tax department from raising tax demands retrospectively, a move that attempts to end long-pending disputes with foreign firms such as Vodafone Plc and Cairn Energy Plc that together involve a sum of more than ₹20,000 crore. The move was seen as investor-friendly, and seeks to bring to an end messy litigation and arbitration, especially with Cairn, which has resulted in the company staking claim to India’s overseas assets. Modi said that the celebration of the 75th Independence Day is an opportunity to build a clear vision and roadmap for India that includes the country’s export ambitions. As the world shrinks due to physical, technological and financial connectivity, new possibilities are being created for the expansion of India’s exports. Modi stressed the importance of strengthening exports to regain India’s old share of the global economy. He urged stakeholders to focus on taking advantage of new opportunities created by changes in the global supply chain following the pandemic. As the country moves towards “Atmanirbhar Bharat”, one of its goals is to increase exports manifold by accessing the global supply chain. “While encouraging competition and excellence, we have to prepare global champions in every sector,” he added. Modi listed four factors that are crucial for increasing exports. Manufacturing has increased and has to be qualitatively competitive, while the problems of transport and logistics should be removed jointly by the Centre, states and private stakeholders. The government should work with exporters, and the international market for Indian products has to be expanded. He stressed the role of states in achieving export targets, implementing reforms, attracting investments, ensuring ease of doing business and creating last mile infrastructure. The central government is working closely with states to minimise the regulatory burden to increase export and investment, he added. Export targets can be achieved only through a holistic action plan. With almost half of India’s exports going to only four major destinations and engineering goods, gems and jewellery, petroleum and chemical products and pharmaceuticals accounting for 60% of exports, there is a need to find new destinations and new export products, he said. The event was also joined by secretaries of more than 20 departments, state government officials, and members of export promotion councils and chambers of commerce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-tells-heads-of-indian-missions-to-ensure-local-goes-global-101628302202881.html

The remarks were in reference to the opposition protest on various issues, which has led to suspension of business in Parliament's monsoon session.Adityanath said that social media is a powerful tool which must be used to spread awareness and positivity rather than spreading fallacious information."Social media has become a powerful instrument of democracy. It must be used as a weapon to counter fake news and statements immediately in order to avoid conflicts that are made up to satisfy selfish motives," the chief minister said while addressing a workshop of Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) IT and social media cell in state capital Lucknow on Friday.Emphasising on the important role social media can play in good governance, the BJP leader said that it is the fastest growing form of media which is also the fourth pillar of a democratic nation. He said that social media should be used in a way to build a better interactive bridge between the government and the citizens.Adityanath asked the party's social media team to highlight the achievements of the BJP-led government."Social media connects people at ground level. So, in order to spread awareness, videos of people who have availed benefits of government schemes must be uploaded to promote them further," he stated.Targeting people who show Uttar Pradesh in bad light, Adityanath further asserted that the opposition leaders, desperate to regain lost political ground, are solely engaged in political stunts to topple the efficient working of the government instead of educating and making people aware of issues in reality."Those who are presenting themselves as 'well wishers' of farmers and are disturbing the peace of the nation must know that over 45 lakh sugarcane farmers in UP have been paid a record cane price payment of more than ₹1,40,000 crore," said the CM adding that, "We must work as a team and make people aware of our achievements through social media to put an end to fake statements."Lashing out at the opposition for creating fake scenarios on social media, the chief minister asked people to be more alert and cautious of what they read and share.Yogi also said that people should first check when they receive a news on social media before forwarding it to others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/social-media-must-be-used-to-wipe-out-negativity-spread-awareness-up-cm-101628294344609.html
07-08-2021||India||Opposition leaders accuse Centre of ‘selectively using’ House channels||Several Opposition leaders slammed the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday for “selectively using” official Parliament channels to display different sets of visuals on screens inside the chambers and outside, saying that it amounts to “suppression of dissent, and censorship”.Former information and broadcasting minister Manish Tewari alleged that the Lok Sabha Television, which airs proceedings of the House, was “censoring” content in a “concerted effort to squelch dissent in the supreme legislative institution”. “Lok Sabha TV is not the property of a particular political party, it must show proceedings in (an) unbiased manner. The selective focusing of the camera is (the) worst form of censorship,” the Congress MP tweeted.“Whenever the opposition raises an inconvenient issue, the mic is switched off. This is a concerted effort to squelch dissent in the supreme legislative institution. It is not only censorship, but it subverts both democracy and rule of law,” he added.Terming the alleged move as “the height of censorship”, he said: “Lok Sabha TV cameras show one thing inside the house on giant TV screens in the Chamber and absolutely another thing on the Lok Sabha TV Channel. As former Union I&B minister, it is preposterous the way a supposedly autonomous institution is behaving.”Tewari’s claims came days after Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’Brien first pointed out the alleged difference in visuals from the House on August 3.Shiromani Akal Dal MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal on Friday said: “Even the Lok Sabha TV is used for a political purpose... Today they even went to the extent of playing a trick on the MPs where TV screens inside the House showed our protests but what the public sees did not show it.”HT reached out to a Parliament official but could not get a response till the time of print.A former LSTV official familiar with the matter, however, said the issue was raised at least twice before, once during the Congress’s tenure with reference to the Telangana Bill and then in 2019 under the BJP government.Besides, the official added, the channel does not control the cameras in the chambers. “What the MPs see on the screens in the chambers is not what is telecast outside,” the official said. The protests that take place on the floor of the House, said the official, are generally avoided. “Moreover, the proceedings can be stopped from being telecast any moment by the Speaker or the Chair.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-leaders-accuse-centre-of-selectively-using-house-channels-101628288461941.html
07-08-2021||India||Help create markets for Indian exports, PM urges missions abroad||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday urged Indian missions abroad to help create new markets for Indian exports exploiting the opportunities created by the economic churn due to the pandemic including the setting up of new and resilient supply chains.Noting that Indian exports were currently about 20% of India’s GDP, the PM expressed the view that this was not commensurate with India’s economic size and manufacturing capacities. “When India is working towards the goal of Atmanirbhar Bharat (self reliant India) one of its goals is to increase the share of Indian exports in the global supply chains,” he told 200 Indian ambassadors and envoys besides members of commercial and economic wings of missions and consulates.The comments came as government data showed that India exported goods worth a record $35.2 billion in July, signalling that the rapid economic recovery in key western markets was increasing demand for Indian products. The government has set a merchandise exports target of $400 billion for FY22 and $1 trillion in the next five years.“We have to make sure that in keeping with international demand, we gain access to markets so that our businesses scale up their capacities to meet these demands,” he said at an event attended by more than 13 Union ministers and senior officials of the 30 ministries.To boost exports, Modi said, manufacturing had to be scaled up with special emphasis on quality of products, transport logistics’ bottlenecks cleared at all levels, the government — both at the central and state levels — need to work closely with Indian businesses and missions need to identify more destinations for Indian products.“When these four factors come together, then only India’s local products will go global,” he said.To the envoys, Modi said they should ensure that 75 new products from India find a market in the countries they are posted in to mark 75 years of Indian independence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/help-create-markets-for-indian-exports-pm-urges-missions-abroad-101628287747653.html

The court refused to give any protection to the petitioners as, it observed, that doing so would amount to “indirectly giving assent to such illicit relations”.In her petition, the woman alleged that she was tortured by her husband and was forced to start living with her partner. She added that her husband recently barged into the house of her partner and tried to disrupt their peaceful life.The court said that if her husband barged into the house, a criminal complaint can be filed against him but “none law abiding citizen who is already married under the Hindu Marriage Act can seek protection of this court for illicit relationship...”The high court however, clarified: “We hold that we are not against granting protection to people who want to live together irrespective of the fact as to which community, caste or sex they belong to.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/livein-relationships-cannot-be-at-cost-of-nation-s-social-fabric-allahabad-hc-101628287422517.html

07-08-2021||India||SC upholds Singapore court order on Future-RIL deal||In a major victory for e-commerce giant Amazon, the Supreme Court on Friday ruled that Future Group is bound by an emergency award that restrains it from a $3.4 billion sale of retail assets to Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).A bench of justices Rohinton F Nariman and BR Gavai held that the Singapore-based Emergency Arbitrator (EA) award, passed in October 2020, was enforceable under Indian arbitration law, and will bind the Kishore Biyani-led group of companies to pertinent agreements with Amazon.“A party cannot be heard to say, after it participates in an Emergency Award proceeding, having agreed to institutional rules made in that regard, that thereafter it will not be bound by an Emergency Arbitrator’s ruling,” said the bench, while allowing the petitions filed by Amazon, which is engaged in a legal wrangle with RIL for domination of the Indian retail market.In its 103-page judgment, the top court noted that “it cannot lie in the mouth of a party to ignore an Emergency Arbitrator’s award by stating that it is a nullity when such party (Future Group) expressly agrees to the binding nature of such award from the date it is made and further undertakes to carry out the said interim order immediately and without delay.”The case was about Future’s decision to sell its assets to Reliance; Amazon contended that it violated the former’s 2019 contract with it. The Singapore EA agreed, restraining Future from going ahead with the deal, even as it went about the arbitration proceedings. The top court’s order upholds that ruling.Underlining that the Future Group agreed to the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) Rules and participated in the proceedings before it, the bench held that no party can turn around after losing and say that the award is a nullity or coram non judice (not before a proper judge) when there is nothing in the Arbitration Act which interdicts an Emergency Arbitrator’s order.The court, referring to a body of Supreme Court judgments, accepted Amazon’s argument and said that an Emergency Arbitrator’s award will be a valid award within the contemplation of the Arbitration Act, and has to be held as an order under Section 17(1) of the Act (for passing interim reliefs).An Amazon spokesperson said: “We welcome the verdict of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India upholding the Emergency Arbitrator’s award. We hope that this will hasten a resolution of this dispute with Future Group.”Future Group said that it has remedies available in law, which it will exercise. “FRL intends to pursue all available avenues to conclude the deal to protect the interests of its stakeholders and workforce,” said a Future Group’s spokesperson, adding they were awaiting the decision of the arbitral tribunal on the emergency award.Meanwhile, rejecting the argument of the Future Group that an emergency award is outside the ambit of Section 17 of the Arbitration Act and an Emergency Arbitrator cannot be construed as an “arbitral tribunal”, the bench highlighted that there is nothing in the Act that prohibits contracting parties from agreeing to a provision providing for an award being made by an Emergency Arbitrator.The court pointed out that Amazon and Future Group have not bypassed any mandatory provision of the Arbitration Act by agreeing to the SIAC Rules and the award of the Emergency Arbitrator. The court also refrained from entertaining submissions by Future Group on “third parties” being affected in enforcement proceedings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-upholds-singapore-court-order-on-future-ril-deal-101628280663056.html
07-08-2021||India||Opposition joins farmers’ protest at Jantar Mantar||Leaders of 13 Opposition parties attended the farmers’ protest at Jantar Mantar against three controversial farm laws on Friday as disruptions and protests continued to rock Parliament for the 14th day with the Opposition sticking to its demand for a debate on the Pegasus phone hacking controversy.Around 200 farmers have been camping at Jantar Mantar since July 22 to hold what they call a ‘kisan parliament’ (farmers’ parliament) to demonstrate against the three central laws that sparked protests in food bowl states immediately after being passed last year.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said at the site, “You all know what is happening in Parliament. We want to talk about the Pegasus in Parliament but they (government) are not allowing the issue of Pegasus to be raised.”He blamed Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “(PM) Narendra Modi has snooped inside every Indian’s phone,” he said.The former Congress chief also announced that the Opposition parties came to Jantar Mantar “to support farmers from all parts of India”.“Nothing can be worked out through a discussion. These laws need to be repealed,” he said.The visit to the protest site, as reported by HT on Friday, however, was not without some underlying tensions in the Opposition ranks. Trinamool Congress (TMC) sent three MPs to Jantar Mantar at 10 am, about two hours before Gandhi and other leaders met the farmers.A senior TMC leader said their schedule was fixed last Tuesday while another leader suggested that TMC would maintain distance from any event seen to be “led” by Gandhi. In the morning meeting where Gandhi was present, Mamata Banejree’s party sent representatives but not their floor leaders.The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Shiv Sena, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Samajwadi Party, Communist Party of India (Marxist), Communist Party of India, Indian Union Muslim League, Revolutionary Socialist Party, National Conference and Loktrantrik Janata Dal were present at Jantar Mantar, apart from the Congress.The monsoon session of Parliament has been washed out by protests and disruptions by Opposition parties over the alleged snooping row, controversial farm bills and rising petrol prices, among other issues.In the Lok Sabha, Congress leader Adhir Chowdhury cautioned the government that they are just “tenants” and “power and money” won’t last forever. He added that from the beginning of the session, the Opposition wanted to debate the three farm laws and the price rise.Junior minister for parliamentary affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal retorted and said that, “Even the government wanted these debates but you (the Opposition) are not allowing us.”With no end to logjam in sight, the government added four more bills, including a Constitutional amendment, in its agenda. It also wants to clear bills to create national commission for homeopathy and national commission for Indian system of medicines.The most important among them is the 127th Constitution Amendment Bill 2021, which was cleared by the Union Cabinet earlier this week and aims to restore the power of states to identify backward castes, effectively bypassing a recent Supreme Court verdict that triggered protests in several states.The amendment would require two-thirds majority in both Houses of Parliament of those present and voting.Government managers said that two senior ministers Pralhad Joshi and Piyush Goyal are in talks with the Opposition to pass the bill. In the Business Advisory Committee meeting, the Congress leaders raised doubts on how the government can ensure that the Houses would be in order—a requirement to pass constitutional amendments. In the BAC, TMC leaders walked out protesting hurried passage of bills without any parliamentary scrutiny.The Pegasus row erupted on July 18 after an international investigative consortium reported that the phones of Indian ministers, politicians, activists, businessmen and journalists were among the 50,000 numbers from around the world that were potentially targeted by the Israeli firm NSO Group’s phone hacking software.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-joins-farmers-protest-at-jantar-mantar-101628280039211.html
07-08-2021||India||Bonhomie after Assam-Mizoram talks yet to reflect at border points||SILCHAR: Ministers and high-level officials of Assam and Mizoram attended an important meeting at Aizwal on Thursday to find a peaceful solution to the border dispute, the first meeting between top functionaries of the two states after the July 26 firing. “Forget the past, we have initiated a discussion to draw a permanent solution on the border dispute between Assam and Mizoram. This is a new beginning,” said Assam’s border security minister Atul Bora said.The two states also agreed not to send their security forces to the disputed areas where neutral forces have been deployed by the central government. Assam also immediately withdrew its travel advisory which asked residents not to travel to Mizoram. But more than 24 hours after the meeting, people are unable to travel through the border areas between Assam and Mizoram. Central forces deployed along the border said they don’t have permission to allow people to cross over in their private vehicles. On Friday, many people were seen walking across the state border but no private vehicles were allowed to operate from either side.Vinay Kumar Saini, assistant commandant, CRPF stopped Carolyne Pachuau, an official in Mizoram’s Kolashib district, when she tried to help a group of people to travel across the border.“We have orders from the higher authority that no private vehicle without a valid permission from their respective district administration or state government can cross the border at this moment. However, we are allowing people with valid documents to cross the border area if they can walk,” the CRPF official told Carolyne Pachuau.Vinay Kumar, who is studying to join a public sector bank, said he walked almost four kilometres to cross Assam-Mizoram border. Along with some of his friends Vinay Kumar, a native of Madhubani in Bihar, is trying to reach Aizawl to write a bank recruitment exam.“We knew that tension is prevailing in the border areas for some days, but we took a chance. The exam will be held on its scheduled date and we are lucky enough to cross even after trekking for more than four kilometres.”Kalyan Ray, a resident of West Bengal, a construction worker with the railways in Mizoram, said he and 10 other co-workers also walked across the border on Friday afternoon.“We had to walk a few kilometres from Kolashib district of Mizoram to Assam’s Lailapur to cross the border because vehicles are not allowed to move,” Ray said.The Mizoram government blames Assam for blocking the road.“We are welcoming the common people of Assam to come to Mizoram. There is no fear or risk. Even the common people are willing to come but Assam government is using its police to man the economic blockade which is prevailing since July 26. During the meeting yesterday, both the states assured that there will be no blockade, but it is unfortunate that Assam is not keeping it’s promice,” Mizoram chief secretary Lalnunmawia Chuaungo told HT: Assam officials deny the charge.Superintendent of police of Assam’s Cachar district, Ramandeep Kaur said officials are trying to convince people not to be afraid to go to Mizoram and plan to conduct meetings with the civilians at border areas in this regard.“Assam government has withdrawn it’s travel advisory yesterday and from our side, nobody is being stopped to travel to Mizoram. Some vehicles are coming from Mizoram side as well, but on Thursday, some locals attacked a vehicle at Lailapur. In order to convince the people, we are going to conduct public meetings in the border areas, which will start from tomorrow.The Cachar administration has deputed seven executive magistrates to strengthen security arrangements along border at Khulichera area under Sonai Circle on Friday and publicised their phone numbers so that people who face any problem can call them.Cachar deputy commissioner Keerthi Jalli also issued an announcement, declaring that the magistrates will take appropriate steps to deal with law and order situation.On the Mizoram side, people including officials suggest there was a gap between the agreements reached between leaders of the two states and the situation on ground.Carolyne Pachuau said camps were build at multiple locations such as Saihapui V, Buarchep, Aitlang, Chuvel, Jauphai/Bhairavi, Phainum, Medli, Mamit and Thinglun even after July 26.“If we look at the names of these places, they all are named in Mizo language. On July 26 Assam police captured our camp which resulted in the unfortunate killing of their six officials. They are still trying to do the same which has angered the common people of Mizoram. It is natural that they will try to save their land from Assam,” she said.On Friday evening, four vehicles carrying eggs to Mizoram were vandalised in Assam. Local residents said they will not lift the blockade till Mizo security forces are withdrawn from their posts till Vairengte auto stand. Police officials rushed to the spot but did not give any details. A police officer incharge of Dholai police station said they were not sure if the incident was linked to the economic blockade.Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma appealed on Twitter not to block movement of goods and people. “While we stand committed to protect our constitutional boundaries, I would appeal to our people to allow movement of good to Mizoram,” he said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bonhomie-after-assam-mizoram-talks-yet-to-reflect-at-border-points-101628280061118.html
07-08-2021||India||Does RBI’s MPC resolution point to stagflation threat?||The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India has kept the policy rate unchanged at 4% and decided to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance. These decisions are on expected lines. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das also unequivocally expressed the central bank’s resolve to aid economic recovery.“The Reserve Bank remains in ’whatever it takes’ mode, with a readiness to deploy all its policy levers – monetary, prudential or regulatory. In 7 parallel, our focus on preservation of financial stability continues. At this juncture, our overarching priority is that growth impulses are nurtured to ensure a durable recovery along a sustainable growth path with stability”, Das said.These statements notwithstanding, the fine print of the MPC resolution does underline worrying trends, including a stagflation (low growth and high inflation) threat for the economy.1. Monetary Policy Committee’s growth projections are unchanged, yet betray pessimismThe latest MPC resolution has retained the GDP forecast for 2021-22 at 9.5%, which was projected in the June meeting. However, a look at the quarterly projections suggests that the MPC members are more bearish on the economy than they were a couple of months ago. Here’s why. In its June meeting, MPC projected GDP growth rate to be 18.5%, 7.9%, 7.2% and 6.6% in successive quarters (June 2021, September 2021, December 2021 and March 2022) of the current fiscal year.The latest projections have upgraded the June projection to 21.4%. This shows that the MPC believes that the second wave of Covid-19 infections did not do as much economic damage as was expected.The reason annual GDP growth has remained unchanged at 9.5% is that the growth projections for second, third and fourth quarter have been revised downward between the June and August meetings. The MPC resolution does not elaborate on the reasons for this. But this is most likely because of demand-side damage.2. There is a significant upward revision in the inflation forecast, with a clear blame on petroleum taxesWhile RBI continues to maintain that the current inflation phase is transient and driven by supply-side issues, the actual picture could be more complicated. Consider fuel prices, for instance.The price of India’s crude oil basket (COB) was $69.7 per barrel on August 5. However, petrol was selling at ₹101.84 per litre in Delhi, a level it did not reach even when COB price crossed $100 in the past.The reason for this disproportionate increase in petrol-diesel price is high central and state taxes – Union excise duty and state VAT contributed ₹32.9 and ₹23.5 per litre to the price of petrol in Delhi.With no significant let up in crude prices even after the OPEC+ deal, the MPC resolution has put the onus of controlling inflation on centre and states cutting taxes on petroleum products.“With crude oil prices at elevated levels, a calibrated reduction of the indirect tax component of pump prices by the Centre and states can help to substantially lessen cost pressures”, the resolution says.3. Is it time to question assumptions about India’s potential growth rate?That the pandemic has disproportionately affected labour (in the labour-capital binary) and the informal sector (in the formal-informal binary) is by now well accepted.Whether at all and to what extent the unequal burden of the pandemic will hurt growth prospects is a question on which there is less unanimity. While one set of economists such as Neelkanth Mishra from Credit Suisse believe that the damage could be minimal because India’s growth was always driven by the top of the pyramid, many others have been pointing out potential headwinds to aggregate demand from the squeeze on incomes of the poor, who have a larger marginal propensity to consume – consumption per unit increase in income – than the rich.This debate is extremely relevant in judging the efficacy of monetary policy as a growth booster as pointed out by Pranjul Bhandari, Chief India Economist at HSBC Securities and Capital Markets India in a research note dated August 2.“Monetary policy is a countercyclical tool. It plays an important role in closing the output gap. But it is not a driver of potential growth. The RBI would be well served to think carefully about when the output gap will likely close and start gradual tightening prior to that since transmission takes time in India”, she wrote.The International Monetary Fund defines output gap as “an economic measure of the difference between the actual output of an economy and its potential output”. Potential output is defined as “the maximum amount of goods and services an economy can turn out when it is most efficient—that is, at full capacity”. In monetary policy parlance, potential output is also taken as the limit which can be reached without stoking inflation.Bahndari highlighted the threat of a reduction in potential output in a research note in May itself. “We were already worried about the scars that the first wave of the pandemic would leave behind – a weak financial system and rising inequality. We had estimated them to drag down India’s post-pandemic potential growth by 1ppt to 5%. We worry that these scars may deepen further with the second wave”, she wrote.When read with the fact that India’s growth rate was below 6% even in the pre-pandemic year, there is all the more reason to worry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/does-rbi-s-mpc-resolution-point-to-stagflation-threat-101628276435768.html
07-08-2021||India||No roads between Kerala and Karnataka dug up: Dakshina Kannada DC||The Deputy Commissioner of Dakshina Kannada district Rajendra KV on Friday denied reports that the district administration had dug up roads near the Kerala-Karnataka border to block the entry points from neighbouring Kerala’s Kasaragod district to prevent unchecked ingress amid fear of Covid third wave. Rajendra told HT that strict instructions have been given to officials not to block the traffic between the two states. He, however, added that the district administration will continue strict vigil across the border and continue to demand RT-PCR reports. AKM Ashraf, a member of the Kerala Legislative Assembly, representing Manjeshwaram, a town on the Karnataka Kerala border, too confirmed that none of the roads between Karnataka and Kerala have been blocked. He, however, added that on Monday, Karnataka police deployed an earthmover to dig a trench on the Kotekar-Mariashram Church Road near Thalappady check post. “It was stopped after residents protested. We haven’t heard of anything after that,” he said. DC Rajendra said he has not received any report of roads being dug up. “If anyone faces any such instances of roads being blocked, they can contact us. There are clear instructions not to stop a vehicular movement. However, those who want to enter Karnataka will have to produce an RT-PCR test report,” he said. For the residents of Kasaragod in Kerala, Mangaluru city in Dakshina Kannada is a lifeline. Even though Mangaluru and Kasaragod are on either side of a map, they are closely knit, say local residents. “Mangaluru, which is referred to as Mangalapuram in Kerala, is the closest city to Kasaragod. From anywhere in Kasaragod, Mangaluru is just 10-50 km away. At the same time, the closest city in Kerala, Kannur, is more than 100 km away,” said Prakash Manjeshwar, a resident of Manjeshwaram, in the northern tip of Kasargod. The residents in and around Kasaragod have been thronging Mangaluru for decades for health care services at the speciality hospitals and for education. “Kasaragod doesn’t have many good hospitals, schools or colleges. So Mangaluru is the only option for us. People in and around Kasaragod had struggled a lot during the initial days of the lockdown when the Karnataka authorities restricted travel, especially for those with medical conditions,” said Krishna Kishore, who runs a business in Mangaluru and lives in Kasaragod. As per the Karnataka government orders, those travelling regularly to Karnataka for work have to take the RT-PCR test once in seven days, while for others, the report can’t be older than 72 hours. “We are very clear that anyone coming to Dakshina Kannada for medical emergencies will not be stopped at any cost,” said Rajendra. However, Kishore added that even the requirement for the RT-PCR test is causing trouble. “First of all, it is very difficult to get an RT-PCR test done in Kerala because of the rise in cases. Over that, it costs a lot of money. For many of us, paying for a test every week is very costly. Especially, since our businesses were close due to the recent lockdown,” he said. Rajendra, however, argued that the district administration doesn’t have a choice but to impose such restrictions. “While the positivity rates in all other districts in Karnataka are coming down, it is going up only in Dakshin Kannada. We can’t find any other reason for this spike other than interstate travel. We are not stopping essential travel such as medical treatment or work. But we can’t have people coming to Mangaluru to visit malls and do other non-essential work. So, the checks will continue,” he said. Meanwhile, according to a health bulletin released by the Dakshina Kannada district authorities on Wednesday, 411 positive cases were reported and the positivity rate stood at 4.07%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-roads-between-kerala-and-karnataka-dug-up-dakshina-kannada-dc-101628276880634.html
07-08-2021||India||ED searches not related to IMA scam: Cong MLA||Congress MLA Zameer Ahmed Khan said on Friday that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) conducted searches at his residence to get details about his house, including its cost, claiming that the action was not related to the ₹4000-crore IMA Ponzi scam.ED searched Khan’s house on Thursday that continued for hours, fuelling speculations that it could be related to his alleged role in the IMA scandal. The ₹4,000-crore scam pertains to money collected by IMA Group from over 100,000 investors in the name of providing attractive returns on investments.“At around 7.30-8 am (Thursday) ED officials came. They had come in connection with getting information about my house. They asked as to when the land was purchased, when the house was constructed and account for it. I have given all the information to them. I told them that white money has been used for construction of the house,” Khan told reporters in Bengaluru.The MLA from Chamrajapet in Bengaluru said officials had taken one of his brothers to the bank to get transaction details, adding that they were “satisfied” with the responses.Khan, however, said the ED officials have told him that he should report to them whenever they seek more information. He denied that he was served any notice.The raids had sparked off a war of words between the ruling BJP and the opposition Congress, with the latter accusing the Centre of misusing investigative agencies to target political rivals.Khan has a palatial house near the Cantonment railway station that took seven years to be constructed. The house was among the places that were searched.On April 27, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had filed a supplementary charge sheet against former Karnataka minister R Roshan Baig in connection with the IMA Ponzi scam. Baig was the minister for urban development in the Congress-led state government between 2014 and 2018. The CBI named the then MD of IMA Group, Mohammed Mansoor Khan, the company and Baig’s company Daanish Publications, among others, in the charge sheet.“It was alleged that the accused former minister received crores of rupees from IMA funds for election expenditure. It was further alleged that the accused was utilising the said funds for day-to-day expenditure, including paying salaries to the employees of his firm. It was also alleged that the accused has spent the funds for various social and cultural activities in his constituency to increase his popularity,” read a statement from CBI.While Khan was questioned by ED and other agencies regarding his property transactions with IMA founder Mohammed Mansoor Khan, he has not been charged by any agency so far.IMA was an investment banking company run by Mansoor Khan, who claimed that it was a Sharia-compliant operation. The company took huge deposits primarily from members of the Muslim community. When IMA stopped paying dividends in March 2019, investors lodged complaints with the police. In June 2019, the Karnataka government set up an SIT to investigate around 51,500 complaints that had been filed by investors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-searches-not-related-to-ima-scam-cong-mla-101628276761852.html
07-08-2021||India||Karnataka to resume physical classes for 9th, 10th and Pre Uni post August 23||Bengaluru Karnataka chief minister Basvaraj Bommai on Friday said that offline classes for 9, 10 and pre-university students would commence from August 23, raising apprehension among parents and other groups amid fears of an imminent third wave of Covid-19 in the state.“It was decided to commence the 9th, 10th and pre-university classes from August 23rd and based on the Covid situation in the state, a decision regarding reopening of primary schools and 8th standard would be taken by the end of August,” said a statement by the chief minister’s office (CMO), attributing it to Bommai.“We have decided to conduct classes on alternate days. Guidelines on Covid norms that need to be followed during the reopening of schools would be issued,” the chief minister added.The decision by the state government comes at a time when there has been a trend of rising infections from across the state. Karnataka has been firm in blaming those coming in from Kerala and Maharashtra for the rising cases while across the state, including state capital Bengaluru, people continue to move around freely with no masks, social distancing or any other precautions.Just two days back, there were hundreds of people gathered in Raj Bhavan for the swearing in ceremony of the newly inducted ministers, chanting slogans and brushing against each other to get a glimpse and picture of their favourite leaders.Bommai said that the administration will review the intensity of the imminent third wave of infections and take a call on reopening physical classes for classes below 8th grade at the end of the month.On Friday, Karnataka reported 1,805 new infections, taking the active caseload to 24,328, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department.The positivity rate stood at 1.11% while 36 more deaths took the toll to 36,741 and fatality rate to 1.99%, data shows.Bengaluru reported 441 new infections and 434 discharges taking its active caseload to 8,560.However, Karnataka’s testing rate remains at around 1.30 lakhs (RT-PCR), indicating that the state may not have been taking enough precautions to prevent a third wave.The shortage of vaccines has also weighed on the state’s management of the pandemic.Karnataka has so far administered 3,23,42,625 doses of vaccines of which the first and second dose account for 2,51,84,304 and 71,58,321 respectively, according to information on Cowin portal. There were 1,81,824 doses administered on Friday. From a high of administering over 7.68 lakh doses of vaccines on August 2, the numbers have dipped to 2.33 lakhs, 2.59 lakhs and 1.63 lakhs since then, data shows.Bommai said that strict action and measures will be taken in border districts to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the state.He added that there would be a weekend curfew imposed in the border districts of Karnataka, which includes districts like Belagavi, Bidar, Vijayapura and Kalaburagi that share a border with Maharashtra. Dakshina Kannada, Kodagu, Mysuru and Chamarajanagar will also have weekend curfews that share a border with Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-to-resume-physical-classes-for-9th-10th-and-pre-uni-post-august-23-101628276700776.html
07-08-2021||India||Three decades on, justice eludes Dalits of Tsunduru||An hour’s drive from Tenali town in coastal Andhra Pradesh, Tsunduru is an idyllic village ringed by fields of lush paddy. But a few steps brings the visitor face-to-face with a nondescript mound of black soil overgrown with shrubs and heaps of garbage – a reminder of the village’s grisly history.Clear the weeds and the graves present themselves, eight of them, next to each other with a board in the background that says: “Johar, Tsunduru Dalitha Mrutha Veerulaku” (A tribute to the Dalit martyrs of Tsunduru). Below this, a question for the visitor in Telugu: If all the killers are innocent, who is responsible for this carnage?This makeshift memorial, known as Raktha Kshetram (Place of Blood), stands testimony to one of the worst anti-Dalit massacres since Independence. Early in the morning on August 6, 1991, members of the Reddy and Kapu communities allegedly attacked the local Mala community, a Dalit sub-caste, with sticks, axes, knives and weapons.Dalits fleeing into the nearby forests were chased, thrashed, their limp bodies stuffed into gunny bags and dumped into the Tungabhadra canal that flows through the village. A team from the local police station allegedly stood by and watched as the Dalitwada (colony) was attacked. Eight men died on the spot, and three more succumbed to their injuries later, including one who allegedly was fired on by the police.The gory crime sent shockwaves across a country at the cusp of liberalisation and an entire generation was jolted. But back at Tsunduru, the besieged Mala community braced themselves for a long fight, coming together to build a movement from the ground up and determined to not let caste hostility stilt their economic and social progress.Thirty years have passed since. Today a new generation of Dalit people is leading the surge: The 750-odd Mala families have their children in schools and colleges, and many have moved to nearby cities of Tenali, Guntur and even Vijayawada.“The Dalits in the village have come a long way in the last 30 years and are living with their heads held high, but the wounds are yet to heal. They continue to rage unless we get the final justice,” said 47-year-old Jaladi Moses, whose father Jaladi Mathaiah and uncle Jaladi Immanuel were among the eight killed.Many of the young Dalit men and women have found employment in government services, as clerks, teachers, officers, bank officers and even software engineers. Shielded from the everyday discrimination that their parents and grandparents took granted for, they have flourished and built a life for themselves. With the money and the confidence of an assured job, many Mala families have built houses and clean roads and sewage.The rundown Dalit colony has now transformed into a separate panchayat by the name of Ambedkar Nagar, a statue of reformer and drafter of the Constitution, BR Ambedkar, towering over their roofs –in itself a signal of the defiance and new-found confidence.“The 750-odd Dalit families, who used to work as agriculture labourers and tenant farmers in the fields of upper-caste people, have all been given agriculture lands to the extent of half-acre to one acre, besides houses in the surrounding villages,” said Suresh, a local Dalit leader.A key source of power in India is politics, and often dominant caste communities feel secure in the sizeable political representation.But in Tsunduru, Dalits have also become politically active. And what has helped them is Vemuru assembly constituency, of which Tsunduru is a part, is reserved for scheduled castes, and now represented by YSR Congress MLA Merugu Nagarjuna. Any person in the locality, even if they are dominant caste, has to go him for any work – a source of pride for the local Mala community.There is also a perceptible change among the Dalit youth, as majority of who are well educated and employed. “In the past, there used to be two-glass system in tea stalls and restaurants (one glass for the forward castes and the other for the Dalits). We never used to walk on their streets with footwear. But now, the youth go to restaurants and sit beside the upper caste people,” Moses said.The Mala community in Tsunduru was able to galvanise the entire state for their legal fight. The legal team received contributions from every corner of the state and the case became a landmark in the state’s civil liberty history, with protests held in many cities including the capital Hyderabad. Much of this work was done by senior advocate and Dalit activist Bojja Tharakam, who died in 2016.The locals were helped by the state government, which has made sub-plans for scheduled castes, making separate budgetary allocations that cannot be transferred to other departments. In addition, land has been assigned to many SC families without the years-long delays that are common in other states, and a network of residential schools, junior and degree colleges exclusively for Dalit students has helped spread education among the community.“Dalits in Tsunduru were successful in making the incident a national issue. Dalit organisations and social activists from across the country visited the village and created awareness. The government was forced to set up a residential school and junior college in the village, as a result of which more and more Dalits have become educated. Today, almost 80 per cent of the Dalits in Tsunduru are educated and work as teachers, lecturers, bank officers, government employees and even software engineers. This was possible only because of the sustained struggle by the Dalits,” Suresh, the local activist, said.But prosperity hasn’t completely erased old fault lines. A road through the middle of Tsunduru divides the Dalit settlement from that of the dominant castes. “The boundary remains even now,” added Suresh.The dominant castes say they have moved on. “It was one of those unfortunate happenings. Why do you want to rake it up again?” was the response of an upper caste man, whose father was one of the people named in the chargesheet as an accused.The fate of the legal case continues to roil older men and women in the Mala community. Many of them say they were witnesses to the carnage and continue to struggle with the trauma. “The police gunned down my younger son in front of my eyes, just because he raised his voice against the killings. My wife has become mentally disturbed. What pains us is that the court had acquitted the police who killed my son,” said K Raja Rao, son of Anil Kumar, in whose memory the Dalits constructed a stupa adjacent to his house.Local villagers say the immediate dispute was triggered by a skirmish in the local cinema hall: A Dalit boy’s feet had touched a Reddy woman; the village condemned this and clamped a boycott of the Mala community, a majority of who are Christian. Tensions rose over the next few days, culminating in the killings of August 6.Sustained advocacy over the next three years prompted the administration to set up a trial court specially constituted for the Tsunduru massacre and trial began in December 1994. Out of the 219 people from the Reddy and Kapu communities who were charged with murder and under the SC/ST prevention of atrocities act, 33 persons died during the course of the 13-year trial. The trial court gave its judgement in July 2007, sentencing 21 accused to life imprisonment and 35 to one-year simple imprisonment.The accused challenged the special court verdict in the Hyderabad high court, which acquitted all of them in 2014 after hearing the case for nearly seven years, citing insufficient evidence. During the course of this prolonged trial, prominent lawyers and human rights activists such as K G Kannabiran, K Balagopal and B Chandrasekhar died of ill-health.“We moved the Supreme Court, which stayed the HC order. The case is still confined to the courtroom,” said senior lawyer Y Koteshwar Rao, who was one of the advocates fighting the case for the Tsunduru victims. The case is still pending in the Supreme Court.Anger simmers in Tsunduru over the fate of the trial. “The high court acquitted the accused on technical grounds – such as lack of clarity on the timing of the deaths, delay in lodging of complaint to the police, inconsistencies in the deposition of witnesses. But eight Dalits were killed; who killed them?” Moses asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-decades-on-justice-eludes-dalits-of-tsunduru-101628274961856.html
07-08-2021||India||Curbs extended, case rise worries experts||Chief minister M K Stalin has announced further extension of lockdown for two weeks in Tamil Nadu, owing to marginal rise in Covid-19 cases in the state. The chief minister held a meeting with medical experts following which, the decision was made. Religious places will remain closed from Friday to Sunday while schools for Class 9 to 12 can reopen from September 1 with 50 per cent capacity, the chief minister said. Tamil Nadu reported 1985 new cases on Friday, taking the total positive cases to 37,494,317. On an average more than 155k people are being tested across the state. The fatalities increased to 34,260 in the state after 30 new deaths were reported.Given the erratic increase in new cases, the state government also empowered district collectors to impose localised restrictions such as closing down markets and other crowded public places. “About five days ago we issued an alert to district officials to not take the increasing cases lightly even if it is marginal,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. “After 69 days of continuous decline we are seeing a mild upward trend now. The test positivity rate is concerning for us in at least 19 districts.” The government has found sources of infections coming from big markets and streets adjacent to it, hospitals and weddings and funerals where norms aren’t followed. “Several people from other states have come to private hospitals for treatment since we have opened up and they’re staying in mansions which are dense and increasing the spread,” said a senior civic official in Greater Chennai Corporation who did not wish to be named.Cases are marginally rising in Tamil Nadu which is worrying the state and experts alike. Tamil Nadu is among the eight states where the R-naught factor is on the rise, the Union government said earlier this week. The R-naught value, which is the average number of people who can contract the infection from one person, is more than one in 18 districts out of the 37 districts in Tamil Nadu. After chief minister M K Stalin held a meeting with experts on Friday, the state extended its lockdown by two more weeks, imposing closure of religious places from Friday to Sunday. But schools from classes 9 to 12 can reopen from September 1 with 50% capacity.Tamil Nadu was only 3 fresh cases short of touching the 2000 mark a day ago. For the past week, cases have risen by 50 or 80 new infections each day. Chennai is usually the hotspot and peaks before the rest of the state but this time the capital city second with 196 cases on Thursday behind Coimbatore district which is reporting the most number of new cases with 220 cases on Thursday.“If the cases are consistently increasing it means the R-naught is above one,” says deputy director of National Institute of Epidemiology, Dr Prabhdeep Kaur who was also part of the chief minister’s meeting. “We don’t know yet if this a temporary increase due to local clusters or a general transmission. That pattern will be clearer in a week.” The expert panel has advised the government to strengthen surveillance, detect clusters and improve testing in the western and central regions of Tamil Nadu.The state has also increased vigil along the districts and points bordering Kerala which has still not weathered the second wave. Those who want to enter Tamil Nadu from Kerala have to submit either a negative RT-PCR test or evidence of double dosage of vaccination. “We are focusing on increasing vaccine coverage. It may be the only way to prevent another wave,” the health secretary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/curbs-extended-case-rise-worries-experts-101628274841102.html

The warning was issued after a crest gate of Dr KL Rao Sagar Pulichintala Project on the Krishna river, located upstream of the barrage, collapsed on Thursday. Consequently, a large quantity of water from Pulichintala was released downstream. The first flood warning was issued at noon on Friday at the Prakasam Barrage when outflow crossed 450k cusecs. All the 70 gates of the barrage have now been lifted to let out the surplus water, an official said. Around 3:30 am, the officials lifted the crest gates of Pulichintala to release surplus water downstream. Gate No. 16 collapsed as the welding holding it to the dam structure gave away. Taking stock of the situation and explaining the damage caused at Pulichintala, Andhra Pradesh minister for water resources, P Anil Kumar Yadav, said, “It all happened in a blink of an eye. Repair works of the 16th gate have been taken up on a war footing and we expect the alternative stop-lock arrangement will be in place soon after the water recedes downstream. At present, flood discharge is 600k cusecs downstream of the project. The full reservoir level of Pulichintala is 45 TMC, and repairs can be done only after the water level is below 10 TMC.” The officials also lifted 14 other crest gates of Pulichintala to release floodwater downstream. The minister and the officials felt that it was unfortunate that such a huge quantity of water had to be released into the sea as there is no other alternative. However, they are confident that water in the project will be replenished in the coming days with more inflows from upstream as the monsoon season is only halfway.An NDRF team of 24 personnel have joined hands with Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) to evacuate residents of Bhupesh Gupta Nagar, Taraka Rama Nagar, Ranigari Thota and other areas in Krishna Lanka of Vijayawada city.The VMC officials visited the colonies and alerted the people to move to the Indira Gandhi Municipal Corporation Stadium where a rehabilitation centre has been arranged. They made arrangements to provide food, drinking water and other facilities to the displaced families. However, most families were resisting shifting to a rehabilitation centre due to fear of theft. The residents say they are habituated to floods and will take shelter on the Karakatta (flood bank) for two to four days till floodwater recedes. The officials tried to convince the residents that there is a fear of major inundation as over half a million cusecs of floodwater is being released. The VMC also arranged 11 tractors to evacuate people to the stadium, and staff has been deployed to raise awareness among the residents on the flood threat. Meanwhile, work of the installation of stop-lock arrangements commenced on Friday afternoon and using a heavy crane, iron plates were being inserted into the groves at sluice number 16, where the flood gate broke and washed away. Project senior engineer Ramesh Babu said that the water level has to decrease to 37 metres. “Only at that point, the stop lock gate fitting works can be started. It takes 10-15 hours to fit the gate,” he explained. On the other hand, the government has constituted a committee with retired engineers to identify the reasons leading to the accidents and also to assess project safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-krishna-river-swells-officials-sound-flood-alert-for-vijaywada-101628274781621.html
07-08-2021||India||Telangana health dept slams politicians for spike in Covid cases||Telangana’s director of public health G Srinivasa Rao on Thursday censured political leaders of all hues for violating protocols by holding rallies and public events for an impending bypoll, amid a sudden spurt in Covid-19 cases. Without naming any political party in particular, Rao said that the second wave of the pandemic is not yet completely under control and urged politicians to act in a responsible manner. “All of a sudden, political activity has increased in the state. Rallies, padayatras and public meetings are being planned everywhere. Political leaders and parties have the right to do so, but they should also have certain responsibilities. When they call for a procession or padayatra, are their followers taking precaution?” he said.Huzurabad assembly constituency in Karimnagar district is awaiting bypolls following the resignation of former health minister and Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leader Eatala Rajender in June this year. Rajender was removed from the state cabinet in May after allegations that firms owned by his family indulged in land grabbing across the state surfaced against him. Eatela refuted all allegations and later quit the TRS to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).While the Election Commission of India is yet to make any announcements on the bypoll, leaders across party lines have begun holding political meetings and events across the district. The official’s outburst came at a time when the district is witnessing an unusual spike in Covid-19 cases for the past few days. “Are political leaders, party workers and people following Covid-19 norms? Leaders don’t wear masks while speaking in public. This can lead to spread of the virus,” he said. Reacting to Rao’s remarks, TRS MLC Bhanu Prasad said, “Yes it is a fact that cases are rising in Karimnagar but we are requesting cadres and also other parties to follow all Covid norms.”The Congress, however, was sceptical of Rao’s warning. “He is less of a health executive and more of a political executive. He is the one who is preempting that the third wave will hit only in December when the reality is it is almost looming upon us. Why did he not advise chief minister KCR to not ban Bonalu (state festival) gatherings last week? When KCR went around in his hometown, did he say anything? There is a political motto in all his statements,” Congress spokesperson Dr Sravan Dasoju said. The BJP too trained its guns on the official. “The fact is, in Telangana, Rao has to come clean on Covid cases in the state everyday before advising political parties. Daily bulletins are not updated and numbers are fudged. He has to adopt a sincere and a non-partisan attitude first. We are in a democractic framework. We don’t have a choice as a political party but to seek mandate from people even during a pandemic. But the BJP will be vigilant and follow all Covid protocols,” BJP spokesperson Krishna Saagar Rao said. Since July 22, Covid-19 cases in Karimnagar have been on the rise. With 61 cases on Thursday, the district recorded the second-highest number of infections as Hyderabad registered 83 cases. The daily caseload in Karimnagar was also the highest among 33 districts on July 26 and August 2. The daily infection count in the district has been ranging from 60 to 75 since July 31.Explaining the consequences of mass gatherings, Dr Ranga Reddy, president of Infection Control Academy Of India, said: “By-elections are a death knell for constituents during a pandemic, whether it is in Telangana or elsewhere in the country. It is unfortunate that no political party is paying heed to Dr Rao’s warnings, including the Telangana chief minister. We doctors are trying relentlessly to break the Covid transmission cycle. Mass gathering will only accelerate the transmissions. Worse, it will exponentially risk the growth of mutations leading to several variants like the delta variant.”On Thursday, the Telangana government sent a team of health department officials to Karimnagar to plan measures for containing the spread of coronavirus and other seasonal diseases. The officials and district administration held a series of meetings with the health staff and medical officers from primary health centres.During a field visit, Rao directed the health staff to conduct 8,000 to 9,000 tests in a day.With a focus on villages with high numbers of infections, medical officers have been asked to spend most of their time visiting such areas to contain the spread and make efforts to bring the case count to zero.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-health-dept-slams-politicians-for-spike-in-covid-cases-101628274780574.html
07-08-2021||India||8-year-old girl’s mutilated body found in Bihar, 12 detained||A day after the mutilated body of an eight-year-old girl was recovered on the bank of the river Ganga in Munger district of Bihar, police on Friday detained 12 people for questioning after forming a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the case. Police said they are yet to get confirmation if the minor was raped.Munger Sadar sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Nandji Prasad, who is heading the SIT, said that one eye of the girl had been gouged out.Munger superintendent of police (SP) Jagunath Jala Reddy said the victim’s body has been sent for postmortem examination to ascertain if she was raped, adding that the report was awaited. The SP said that he has requested the doctors to submit the report at the earliest.“Some people have been taken into custody for questioning. We cannot reveal their identity now,” he added.The girl’s uncle on Friday said, “She had bleeding marks on her private parts. The criminals also gouged her right eye and damaged her left eye. Her nails had blood clotting marks.” He added her hands and feet were fractured.The gruesome murder of the minor, a Class 3 student at a government school, has once again brought spotlight on crime against women in Bihar. The Bihar Police headquarters officials, quoting NCRB’s 2019 data, said Bihar ranks 31 in rape cases and 28th in crime against women.“Munger incident was barbaric and reflected how the crime against women especially minor girls was on the rise in Bihar. The case should be thoroughly probed. In recent few years, there has been a disconcerting trend of rape victims getting killed as the culprits do not want to leave any evidence. The crime cases in the state are alarming,” said Nivedita Jha, a women’s rights activist.According to the police, the girl went missing after she along with her father had gone for fishing on Wednesday afternoon. Her father lodged a missing person’s report the same night.According to the complaint, the girl and her father had gone for fishing in the Ganga. However, the girl left to return home alone around 4pm, but never reached. Her body was found around 5am on Thursday at a secluded spot, barely 300 metres from her house, police said.The SP said a case was lodged in this connection under sections 302 (murder), 363 (kidnapping) of the Indian Penal Code adding that sections under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act will also be invoked on the basis of the father’s complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8yearold-girl-s-mutilated-body-found-in-bihar-12-detained-101628274720428.html
07-08-2021||India||Marital rape grounds for divorce: Kerala HC||Marital rape, though not penalised in the country, is a valid ground to claim divorce, the Kerala high court said on Friday, upholding a family court’s decision to allow divorce on the grounds of “marital cruelty”.A division bench of justice Mohammad Mushtaq and justice Kauser Edappagath dismissed the appeal of a man who had challenged a family court order allowing his wife’s plea for divorce on grounds of cruelty. The court said that an “insatiable urge for wealth and sex” of a spouse also amounted to cruelty.“In a married life, sex is reflection of the intimacy of the spouse. The evidence given by the woman establishes that she was subjected to all sorts of perversion against her will. Marital rape occurs when the husband is under notion that body of his wife owes to him,” the bench said.Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) defines the offence of rape with the help of six descriptions. One of the exceptions to this offence is “sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under 15 years of age, is not rape”.Marital rape is not criminalised in India but activists say the exception forces women to suffer sexual violence in their homes. In the past, the Centre has argued that criminalising marital rape may destabilise the institution of marriage.According to the woman, the man is a qualified medical doctor but later moved to real estate business and construction, which was not successful. Facing financial losses, the woman alleged, her husband subjected her to constant harassment for money, due to which her father gave approximately ₹77 lakh to the man on various occasions.In her deposition during cross examination, the woman also accused the appellant of forcibly having sex with her when she was sick, bedridden, and even on the day her mother died. She also deposed that she was subjected to unnatural sex and forced to have sex in front of their minor daughter. Besides, she said he always suspected her fidelity and accused her of having an illicit relationship.“In this case, the insatiable urge for wealth and sex of the husband had forced the wife to take a decision for divorce. His licentious and profligate conduct cannot be considered as part of normal conjugal life. Therefore, we have no difficulty in holding that insatiable urge for wealth and sex of a spouse would also amount to cruelty. The right to respect for his or her physical and mental integrity encompasses bodily integrity, any disrespect or violation of bodily integrity is a violation of individual autonomy,” the court said.The two-judge bench further noted that the concept of family as a “social unit” was gradually “withering away”.“If marriage is seen as a symbol to project status, without reflecting the values the individuals or society would cherish to profess, we may miss the basic concept required for marriage. The concept of family as a social unit is also slowly withering away to recognise the concept of bond created by the individuals. The individuals who were reluctant to separate, fearing social fear, and on the ideal of the sacrament of marriage, have no fear now to approach the court for divorce to establish the free act of will. Matrimonial relationship is all about contentment. When there is harmony at home, that leads to contentment in marriage. The harmony is evolved through mutual respect and trust. The debt of the husband sparked the dispute between him and the wife.”The judges described the case as “a story of the struggle of a woman within the clutches of law to give primacy of choice not to suffer in the bondage of legal tie”:The court further suggested that marriage and divorce must be brought under the secular law. “Individuals are free to perform their marriage in accordance with the personal law but they cannot be absolved from compulsory solemnization of marriage under secular law. Marriage and divorce must be under the secular law, this is the need of the hour. Time has come to revamp the marriage law in our country,” it observed.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/marital-rape-grounds-for-divorce-kerala-hc-101628274480429.html
07-08-2021||India||Do you intend to close tribunals, Supreme Court asks Centre amid vacancies||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Union government if it wants all tribunals wrapped up since they are unable to function even otherwise due to massive shortage of manpower, leaving people hapless.A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, censured the Centre over huge vacancies in various tribunals across country, effectively crippling their functioning, despite several recommendations made for filling up vacancies in the last two years.“Get instructions from the authorities whether they want to continue with the tribunal or shut them completely...You cannot keep people remedy less. If you don’t want tribunals, just tell us. We will entrust the jurisdiction to the concerned high courts. You cannot have tribunals but not fill up their vacancies,” the bench, which included justice Surya Kant, told solicitor general Tushar Mehta.Mehta, representing the Centre, sought to point out that some delay could also be attributed to a spate of cases pending before the Supreme Court on appointments, service conditions and tenure of the members of the tribunal.But the bench was not impressed with the submission. “Tribunals are creation of statutes and recommendations have been made by the selection committees absolutely in accordance with the statutes but you still haven’t appointed people. These selection committees have judges of this court and some of them made recommendations way back in 2019 but nothing happened,” it retorted.The court told the S-G: “The concern is that we want to know it clearly from you whether you want the tribunals or you want to close them down. The impression that we gather is that the bureaucracy does not want tribunals at all. Just tell us and we will entrust their jurisdiction to the high court once again. It is a very sorry state of affairs.”The bench was hearing petitions by advocate Amit Sahni and the State Bar Council of Madhya Pradesh when it reproached the Union government for delay in filling up more than 200 vacancies across 15 tribunals in the country.Sahni has demanded the constitution of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) appellate tribunal which had not been set up even after 4 years of the GST Act being into existence.“How many years back the GST Act came into force? And for 4 years, you have not been able to create an appellate tribunal. You passed an administrative order to increase the limitation period for filing appeals but you did not create an appellate tribunal,” the bench told Mehta while issuing a notice to the Centre on Sahni’s plea.The MP bar council, on the other hand, challenged the transfer of the jurisdiction of Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT), Jabalpur to DRT, Lucknow due to the unavailability of a presiding officer at Jabalpur. While Mehta submitted that the Centre was willing to transfer the jurisdiction of DRT, Jabalpur to some other tribunal in the same city, the court rejected the suggestion calling it “pure adhocism.”“Decide within a week and convey to us. We are very serious if you don’t do it, we will order the appearance of the top officers to give an explanation. Please don’t invite such a situation,” the bench told the S-G, listing the cases on August 16.According to a list prepared by the court’s registry and read out by the CJI, tribunals across the country are awaiting appointments of 19 presiding officers and more than 100 members each on the judicial and technical side. These tribunals deal with cases of debt recovery, telecom dispute company law, consumer dispute, income tax, custom and service tax, environment protection, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/do-you-intend-to-close-tribunals-supreme-court-asks-centre-amid-vacancies-101628273340358.html
07-08-2021||India||SC expresses displeasure over filing of bulky petitions||The Supreme Court on Friday chided the practice of filing bulky petitions running into hundreds of pages and wondered if it is being used as a tactic to “terrorise the judges”.“How can someone file 51 volumes of pleadings in one case? Yesterday, we had to engage a lorry to carry this. We don’t want us to hear this matter or what? You are terrorising us by filing 51 volumes in a single case,” a bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana remarked.The court was hearing a clutch of appeals filed against the June 30 judgment of the Bombay high court which had partially upheld the validity of the new tariff order (NTO) issued by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) in January 2020. The NTO had prescribed price ceilings on the rates charged by TV channels.As a bunch of senior lawyers appeared in the appeals filed by Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation and several TV channels, the bench was livid over the sheer weight of the pleadings filed by them.“Before you argue, just tell us why have you filed 51 volumes? Is it because you don’t want us to read anything?” the bench, which also included justice Surya Kant, asked senior advocate Darius Khambata who appeared for one of the petitioners.Khambata responded by saying that there were several petitions listed together but the court was not satisfied with the reply. “You must file small volumes if you want to be heard. File convenience volumes before the next date. We will hear it later,” it told Khambata and other senior lawyers representing the petitioners.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, on behalf of the Union government, said that he would instead file his submissions of “only two pages”. The matter was then adjourned to August 18.Minutes later, the bench came across yet another case with bulky case files. E-commerce giants Amazon and Flipkart had challenged an order of Karnataka high court allowing the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to continue its investigation against them into alleged competition law violations.Even before senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Flipkart, could commence his submissions, CJI Ramana questioned him for filing copious case papers.“Why are there so many bulky case files? It looks like all of you want to terrorise the judges by filing voluminous paper books. You don’t want judges to come to court having read the files because of their size,” remarked the bench.This case was also adjourned to August 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-expresses-displeasure-over-filing-of-bulky-petitions-101628273160453.html
07-08-2021||India||President invites ministers for high tea||President Ram Nath Kovind has invited the Union council of ministers for a high tea at the Rashtrapati Bhavan on Saturday, days after the Narendra Modi-led government conducted its biggest reshuffle in the council since 2014.The Rashtrapati Bhavan described it as a courtesy meeting. As several new ministers were inducted into the council during the rejig, the President has called all of them together, it said.“This is not the first time that such an event will take place,” a Rashtrapati Bhavan functionary familiar with the development said.On July 7, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inducted 36 new faces into the council and promoted seven junior ministers to independent or Cabinet roles.Modi dropped 12 ministers, including the ministers of health, education, information technology, law, environment and information, and broadcasting in the biggest rejig in the council since 2014 when he first took over as the Prime Minister.The President is likely to give a speech at the event on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/president-invites-ministers-for-high-tea-101628272980396.html
07-08-2021||India||Qatar special envoy in Delhi to discuss Afghan situation||Qatar’s special envoy for conflict resolution Mutlaq bin Majed Al-Qahtani, who has played a key role in the Afghan peace process, on Friday met the external affairs ministry’s pointperson for Afghanistan to discuss the latest developments in the war-torn country.Al-Qahtani, who holds the official title of special envoy of the Qatari foreign minister for counter-terrorism and mediation of conflict resolution, is currently on a two-day visit to India.He met joint secretary JP Singh of the external affairs ministry’s Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran (PAI) desk and exchanged views on the current situation in Afghanistan and recent developments in the Afghan peace process, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.Al-Qahtani will meet foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday. He also met Sanjay Bhattacharya, the secretary responsible for consular issues and overseas Indian affairs on Friday.The Qatari diplomat’s visit to India comes days ahead of two key meetings in Doha on the situation in Afghanistan. Russia has convened a meeting of the “extended troika”, which includes China, the US and Pakistan, in Doha on August 11. Qatar will host a separate meeting between the Afghan side and its regional and international partners later this month.Various stakeholders are looking to these meetings to help revive the Afghan peace process, which has been stalled for several months, against the backdrop of the Taliban’s violent campaign to capture territory and urban areas, including provincial capitals.In June, Al-Qahtani had confirmed that Indian officials were engaged in talks with the Taliban – a development first reported by Hindustan Times. He told a webinar at the time that he believed the Indian side is engaging the Taliban as the group is seen as a “key component” in any future government in Kabul.He also said that Qatar would not recognise any group that seeks to take Afghanistan by force.India too has opposed any forcible takeover in Afghanistan, saying such a regime would lack legitimacy, and backed calls for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire and the resumption of negotiations to find a political settlement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/qatar-special-envoy-in-delhi-to-discuss-afghan-situation-101628272200451.html
07-08-2021||India||RBI holds rate, ups inflation projection||The Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) reiterated its commitment to reviving sustainable economic growth even as it raised the inflation projection for the current fiscal year to 5.7%, an increase of 60 basis points – one basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point – compared to the projection in its June meeting.There is no doubt about what RBI thinks is more important at this point in time; RBI governor Shaktikanta Das (he quoted Martin Luther King Jr in his comments) termed inflationary pressures “transitory”, and “driven by adverse supply side factors” and was unequivocal that “at this stage... continued policy support from all aides -- fiscal, monetary, and sectoral -- is required to nurture the nascent and hesitant recovery”.And the policy rate (at 4%) and monetary policy stance have been kept unchanged at 4% and accommodative.The message is clear: RBI thinks growth is a concern, not inflation. It is not an assessment with which all analysts agree, not least because inflation has been stubborn.The MPC resolution also put the onus of bringing down petrol-diesel prices on the Union and state governments through tax reduction. While it has retained its 2021-22 gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast of 9.5%, it has underlined demand side headwinds to the ongoing economic recovery. Experts have highlighted two facts -- a difference of views within MPC on the question of retaining the accommodative policy stance and the central bank announcing additional variable rate reverse repo auctions (which will take back some of the excess liquidity in the system) -- to argue that the monetary policy will see a gradual normalisation of policy setting and perhaps move in sync with the country’s vaccination programme.RBI will “continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy”, the MPC resolution after its three-day meeting from August 4-6 said. The focus on prioritising the ongoing economic recovery despite high inflation was justified on the grounds of achieving a gradual reduction in inflation. “The approach to inflation is not a cold turkey method, where you slam the economy until it goes limp,” RBI deputy governor Michael Patra said. “It is important to bring that down over time and not immediately.”Patra’s remarks are in line with the MPC’s inflation prognosis. “The current assessment is that the inflationary pressures during Q1:2021-22 are largely driven by adverse supply shocks which are expected to be transitory,” the MPC resolution said.The emphasis on protecting the economy makes sense when read with the MPC’s assessment of the economy. “The outlook for aggregate demand is improving, but still weak and overcast by the pandemic. There is a large amount of slack in the economy, with output below its pre-pandemic level,” the resolution said. While the MPC has increased its forecast for GDP growth in the June 2021 quarter from 18.5% to 21.4%, growth forecasts for the next three quarters of the current fiscal year have seen a downward revision this time. This suggests a weakness in demand going forward.The MPC’s projections are in line with the trend seen in high frequency indicators in the month of July.While Purchasing Mangers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing showed an impressive jump to 55.3 from 48.1 in June, PMI services remained below the critical threshold of 50, values above which signify an expansion in economic activity, compared to last month. The Nomura India Business Resumption Index has also shown a marginal fall in the last two weeks; from 96.4 in the week ending July 18 to 95 in the week ending August 1.“We think there are some good reasons why RBI should begin to plan a gradual exit (from loose monetary policy). Inflation has been higher than 4% for 21 months and is likely to remain so over the foreseeable future. And monetary policy has its limits in driving growth. It is a countercyclical tool and can help close the output gap, but not drive potential growth,” Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC Securities and Capital Markets, said in a note.“Deputy governor’s comments on growth and inflation indicate that RBI would be patient in withdrawing accommodation. Next steps in the gradual normalisation in October could be further increase in the VRR volume and reduction in 3Q GSAP but a reverse repo hike could be delayed,” Samiran Chakraborty, chief India economist at Citi Research, said in a note.Aurodeep Nandi, India economist and vice president at Nomura, said: “From a head-in-sand approach on higher inflation so far, this policy meeting finally saw some implicit acknowledgement that continued disregard for inflation ultimately comes at the cost of policy credibility and markets eventually exacting higher risk premia. This was reflected in the dissent of one of the MPC members against the accommodative stance, and the RBI’s move to slowly start draining the liquidity swamp.”However, Nandi added, “The policy has tried to tread a tightrope in attempting to differentiate its liquidity manoeuvres from the accommodative policy rate stance, and continuing to insist that inflationary pressures remain temporary and that the growth recovery is still in its nascence.”Uday Shankar, president, Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), said: “The Central Bank’s indication yet again to continue with the accommodative stance, until necessary, to revive growth is encouraging. This is especially comforting when there was an expectation about the normalisation of the monetary policy. The central bank has thoughtfully navigated the monetary policy through the pandemic. We are confident that the same thoughtfulness will continue in the future especially in view of an anticipated third wave and the continuing softness in the economy.”Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser, State Bank of India, said in the SBI Ecowrap: “While the policy strikes a delicate balance between reinvigorating growth and keeping inflation in check, it seems that RBI growth projections being retained at 9.5% is more of a statistical artefact as Q1 growth numbers have been revised upwards, while Q2-Q4 growth numbers have been significantly downgraded. Thus it is clear that the central bank currently foresees recovery as incipient which will likely lose steam as pandemic uncertainties continue to rule the roost. This provides a clear justification for central bank to continue supporting growth till it revives.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rbi-holds-rate-ups-inflation-projection-101628272139681.html
07-08-2021||India||Army, Chinese PLA pull back troops from Gogra||The Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have pulled back their forward deployed troops from Gogra, or Patrol Point-17A, which was one of the friction points on the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) where forces from both sides were “in a face-off situation” since May last year.The breakthrough came after the 12th round of military talks held in the Ladakh sector last week, the Indian Army announced on Friday, and the disengagement process was carried out on August 4, 5. The development came almost six months after the two armies pulled back their front-line troops and weaponry from the Pangong Tso sector in mid-February after the ninth round of talks.“As per the agreement (reached during the 12th round of talks on July 31), both sides have ceased forward deployments in this area (PP-17A) in a phased, coordinated and verified manner. The troops of both sides are now in their respective permanent bases,” the army said in a statement.As part of the disengagement process, both armies have dismantled temporary structures erected by them along with allied infrastructure, with the actions being mutually verified. “The landform in the area has been restored by both sides to the pre-standoff period (April 2020),” it said.India and China have been locked in a border row for 15 months, a phase that witnessed a deadly skirmish in the Galwan Valley and saw tensions spiral between the rival armies on the north and south banks of Pangong Tso last year. The two armies kicked off talks to cool border tensions in June 2020.“This agreement ensures that the LAC in this area will be strictly observed and respected by both sides, and that there is no unilateral change in status quo. With this one more sensitive area of face-off has been resolved. Both sides have expressed commitment to take the talks forward and resolve the remaining issues along the LAC in the Western Sector,” the statement said.The current agreement removes a flashpoint from one of the areas and should be welcomed, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd). “Hopefully, it could provide grounds for further disengagement in other areas. The real test will come when Depsang is discussed, and a breakthrough here could lead to a major de-escalation,” Hooda said.On July 31, top Indian and Chinese commanders agreed to a speedy resolution of outstanding issues on the LAC at the 12th round of talks held at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC, with the dialogue focusing on disengagement of rival troops from the remaining flashpoints on the contested border.“As an outcome of the meeting, both sides agreed on disengagement in the area of Gogra. The troops in this area have been in a face-off situation since May last year,” the army said. A joint statement issued after the 12th round described the talks as “a candid and in-depth exchange of views on resolution of remaining areas related to disengagement along the LAC in the Western Sector of India-China border areas.”The latest round of talks was held following the meeting of the Indian and Chinese foreign ministers on July 14, in Dushanbe, and the 22nd meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) on June 25.Problems at Hot Springs and Depsang are yet to be resolved. To be sure, the problems at Depsang predate the current border standoff. “The focus will now be on resolving outstanding issues at other friction points,” said a senior officer.Both armies have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each in the Ladakh theatre and the deployments haven’t thinned after the disengagement in the Pangong Tso sector.“The Indian Army, along with Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), is totally committed to ensure the sovereignty of the nation and maintain peace and tranquillity along the LAC in the Western Sector,” the army statement added.The Indian Army’s patrolling activity has been affected in Hot Springs (PP-15). The PLA’s forward presence in Depsang has also hindered access of Indian soldiers to routes including the ones leading to PP-10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-chinese-pla-pull-back-troops-from-gogra-101628272081793.html
07-08-2021||India||Iran President backs India’s role in Afghan peace process||Iran’s new President Ebrahim Raisi on Friday backed India’s role in the establishment of peace and security in Afghanistan and highlighted the need for a joint plan to elevate relations between Tehran and New Delhi.Raisi, who was formally sworn in on Thursday, made the remarks during a meeting with external affairs minister S Jaishankar, who represented India at the inauguration. Jaishankar tweeted after the meeting that there is “convergence” between the two sides on regional interests.Jaishankar’s two-day visit to Tehran coincided with India walking a diplomatic tightrope in its current role as president of the UN Security Council following demands from Britain and the US for a discussion on a deadly tanker attack off the coast of Oman that has been blamed on Iran.At his meeting with Jaishankar, Raisi stressed the importance of close cooperation and coordination between India and Iran in developing regional peace and stability, according to a statement from the Iranian president’s office.“Iran and India can play a constructive and useful role in ensuring security in the region, especially Afghanistan, and Tehran welcomes New Delhi’s role in the establishment of security in Afghanistan,” Raisi said.The fate of Afghanistan, Raisi said, “must be decided by the Afghans themselves”. He contended that “if the Americans do not sabotage the situation, this issue will be resolved quickly”.Iran attaches “special importance” to extensive relations with India, and there is a need for a “joint cooperation programme” to elevate bilateral ties, Raisi said. “From today on, we should take new and distinct steps in the development of bilateral, regional and international relations with a new perspective,” he said.“By moving in the direction of a joint cooperation programme, we can take steps to bring about different conditions at the level of relations between the two countries in the interests of the two nations,” he added.Raisi said the Iranian government will pursue a policy of developing ties with neighbouring countries and the region, especially India. “There are various sectors, especially in the economic and commercial fields, as well as new technologies, that we should use to promote the level of our relations,” he added.Jaishankar tweeted that he had a “warm meeting” with Raisi, during which he conveyed the personal greetings of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “His commitment to strengthening our bilateral relationship was manifest. So too was the convergence in our regional interests,” he added.Bilateral ties took a massive hit after India stopped importing oil from Iran in mid-2019 because of sanctions imposed by the former Trump administration. At the time, Iran was among India’s top three energy suppliers. Iran has also been upset at the pace of development of Chabahar port by the Indian side. Recent moves by Tehran to develop a railway line to Chabahar and the Farzad B gas field without Indian involvement have not gone down well with New Delhi.However, two visits by Jaishankar have helped give fresh impetus to ties, especially at a time when the two countries have similar interests with regard to the situation in Afghanistan. Jaishankar was the first foreign leader to meet Raisi, then the president-elect, during a stopover in Tehran on July 9 while on his way to Russia.Iran ambassador Ali Chegeni said Jaishankar’s two visits to Iran and meetings with Raisi in less than a month “show the strong will of our leaders to expand bilateral relations and draw a very positive and promising vision”.However, the Indian side will still have to cope with the diplomatic crisis over last week’s drone attack on the tanker Mercer Street, managed by Israeli-owned Zodiac Maritime, that killed two crew members – a Briton and a Romanian.The issue is set to be discussed by the UN Security Council amid claims by Britain and the US that Iran was behind the attack. Tehran has denied any involvement in the July 29 attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iran-president-backs-india-s-role-in-afghan-peace-process-101628272022609.html
07-08-2021||India||Twitter ‘seemingly’ complied with new IT rules: Govt in Delhi HC||Social media company Twitter has “seemingly” complied with the new Information Technology (IT) Rules that came into force from May 25, the Centre told the Delhi high court on Friday but stressed that the government will need time to verify the compliance cited by the microblogging platform in a fresh affidavit.The Centre’s assertion came in response to observation on Twitter’s status by Justice Rekha Palli after the social media firm, in its affidavit, said it has appointed a permanent Resident Grievance Officer (RGO), Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) and Nodal Contact officer (NCO) on August 4 in compliance with the rules.The appointments were made after Justice Palli, on July 28, gave the social media firm one last opportunity to “wholeheartedly” comply with the new IT Rules notified in February this year that sought to put in place a stricter regulatory mechanism that companies like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube will need to abide by.Under the new guidelines that came into force from May 25, significant social media intermediaries - those with 50,000 users or more - were required to appoint a compliance officer “responsible for ensuring compliance with the Act and Rules”, a nodal contact person for 24x7 coordination with law enforcement agencies and a Resident Grievance Officer mandated to deal with complaints to take down offensive content within 24 hours of a complaint.At the July 28 hearing, Justice Palli objected to the company describing the official appointed as RGO and CCO as ‘contingent worker’ and asked Twitter to file a fresh affidavit. “I am not happy with this affidavit anyway,” Justice Palli said.The social media firm’s fresh affidavit, which sought to respond to the court’s concern, clarified that it earlier appointed Vinay Prakash as the Resident Grievance Officer (RGO) and Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) through a third-party contractor, PRO Unlimited India Private Limited. It said that the initial appointment was made through a third party to expedite compliance of the IT Rules since it didn’t have a corporate presence in India.“The appointment was considered contingent because Twitter, Inc. expected to convert the position to a full-time employee as soon as practicable. Twitter, Inc. has since converted Mr Prakash to a full-time employee effective August 4, 2021…..that Mr Vinay Prakash is, and has been since his initial appointment, fully capable of performing the functions of Chief Compliance Officer and Resident Grievance Officer as contemplated under Rule 4(1)(a) and (c),” Twitter said in an affidavit.Senior advocate Sajjan Poovaya, who appeared for Twitter, also told the court that the company has employed Shahin Komath, an Indian resident, as Nodal Contact Person in compliance of section 4(1)(b) of the IT Rules, 2021.When the court remarked that “this means they are in compliance” of the IT Rules, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma for the Centre, responded, “seemingly so”. He said that the Union government is yet to verify the compliance and sought time to do the same.Justice Palli directed that the affidavits be taken on record and posted the matter for further hearing on August 10.During Friday’s hearing, senior advocate G Tushar Rao for the petitioner-lawyer Amit Acharya, objected to one person, Vinay Prakash, being appointed as the RGO and CCO, insisting that this was legally incorrect. This submission was, however, contested by Twitter’s counsel.Petitioner-lawyer Amit Acharya approached the court days after the May 25 deadline ended, complaining that he could not seek action against two alleged offensive tweets by TMC MP Mohua Moitra and journalist Swati Chaturvedi because Twitter hadn’t complied with the rules. His complaint was later disposed of by Twitter saying that the tweets in question were not offensive according to its policies.The delay in compliance with the new IT Rules had triggered a faceoff between the social media company and the government which contended that its failure to comply with the guidelines could cost it the safe harbour protection granted to intermediaries under the IT Act. At the peak of the back-and-forth between the two sides, Twitter criticised the new IT Rules and regulations saying these “inhibit free, open public conversation”. In response, the Centre accused the platform of levelling baseless and false allegations to defame India and dictating terms to the world’s largest democracy.Twitter, in turn, has raised concerns about the safety of its employees in India and flagged intimidation by the police. There have been several instances of confrontation between the social media firm and the government over orders to block access to content and the marking of posts by BJP leaders as manipulated media. On July 22, the union government had informed the Rajya Sabha that even though Twitter was non-compliant with the IT Rules till May 26, it had subsequently appointed an RGO and CCO and submitted its first compliance report in June this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-seemingly-complied-with-new-it-rules-govt-in-hc-101628271723516.html
07-08-2021||India||J&J and Novavax seek approval for vaccines||Two coronavirus vaccine makers, Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and Novavax, announced that they have approached the Indian drugs regulator for emergency approval of their products, raising the possibility of large quantities of doses becoming available over the next months as the country races to inoculate more people to stave off a third wave of Covid-19.Both of the companies have partnered with Indian vaccine manufacturers: Pune-based Serum Institute of India is producing and carrying out trials for Novavax, and Hyderabad-based Biological E is producing doses for J&J.The J&J vaccine has been approved by several western countries and is in use in many of these, while the Novavax dose has shown some of the most promising results in clinical trials.“On 5th August 2021, Johnson & Johnson Pvt Ltd applied for emergency use authorisation (EUA) of its single-dose Covid-19 vaccine to the government of India. This is an important milestone that paves the way to bringing our single-dose Covid-19 vaccine to the people of India, and the rest of the world, through a collaboration with Biological E Limited,” the company said in a statement.Novavax too issued a statement, saying: “Novavax Inc, with its partner, Serum Institute of India Pvt Ltd (SII), today announced that the companies have filed regulatory submissions for emergency use authorisation of recombinant nanoparticle protein-based Covid-19 vaccine candidate. The submissions were made to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) and regulatory agencies in Indonesia and the Philippines”.The Novavax vaccine showed an efficacy rate of 90% in clinical trials but is yet to be approved for emergency use in any country.The J&J vaccine, which has shown 66-72% efficacy in different trials, has been approved by regulators in the US, UK, Europe and the World Health Organization. The company in May applied for a permission to carry out bridging trials – smaller clinical trials that are meant to assess if the findings are similar to larger trials carried out elsewhere. But it withdrew the request last week and filed for emergency approval directly, making use of a change in policy in India that allows coronavirus vaccine makers to do so if they have received approvals by certain regulators around the world.The statement said J&J looked forward to concluding its discussions with the government of India to accelerate availability of its Covid-19 vaccine to help end the pandemic.Experts said J&J’s single dose vaccine could help vastly improve availability. “Yes, single dose vaccine works better; we may need a booster later, but it’s a great addition,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, senior vaccine expert, from CMC Vellore.Representatives of both the vaccine makers’ Indian partners also met top Indian officials on Friday.Union health minister, Mansukh Mandaviya, on Friday met the managing director of Biological E, Mahima Datla, although the two discussed Corbevax, the other coronavirus vaccine Biological E is developing. This dose is in collaboration with the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.“Met Ms Mahima Datla, MD of @Biological_E, who briefed me on the progress of their upcoming #COVID19 vaccine, Corbevax. I assured all the Government support for the vaccine,” the health minister tweeted.SII chief executive Adar Poonawalla too met Mandaviya as well as Union home minister on Friday. Poonawalla, news agency PTI reported, later said that he expects Covavax (the Novavax dose made by it) to become available for adults by October and for children by the first quarter of next year if all regulatory processes proceed as planned.“…hopeful that for adults Covovax will be launched in October, depending on DCGI approvals… The Covovax vaccine for kids will be launched in the first quarter of the next year most likely in January-February,” news agency PTI quoted Poonawalla as saying following the meeting.Novavax, in its statement, said it and SII have completed the submission of all modules required by regulatory agencies in India, Indonesia and the Philippines for the review, including preclinical, clinical, and chemistry, manufacturing and controls data.“Today’s submission of our recombinant nanoparticle COVID-19 vaccine, the first protein-based option filed with any regulatory agency, represents a major milestone in Novavax transformation into a commercial global vaccine company,” said Stanley C Erck, president and chief executive officer, Novavax||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jj-and-novavax-seek-approval-for-vaccines-101628271723017.html
07-08-2021||India||Won’t accept a govt imposed by force in Afghanistan: UNSC||Members of the UN Security Council on Friday made it clear the world community wouldn’t accept any government forcibly imposed in Afghanistan by the Taliban, even as India called for the dismantling of terror safe havens and sanctuaries in Pakistan.A meeting of the Security Council held under the Indian presidency to discuss the situation in Afghanistan was given a grim briefing on the fallout of the Taliban’s massive campaign of violence and attacks by Deborah Lyons, the UN secretary-general’s special representative, who said the country was at a “dangerous turning point”.Most of the representatives of the 15 permanent and non-permanent members of the Security Council strongly opposed any military takeover of the Taliban and the representatives of France and the US said further exemptions from sanctions on Taliban leaders, especially for travel, would be affected by failure to end violence.India holds the rotating presidency of the Security Council for August and played a key role in organising the meeting on Afghanistan. TS Tirumurti, India’s envoy to the UN, listed the surge in Taliban attacks and violence, including the suicide assault on the home of the Afghan defence minister and the killing of Indian journalist Danish Siddiqui, and said the rapid deterioration of security poses a “serious threat to regional peace and stability”.In an obvious reference to Pakistan, Tirumurti said: “For enduring peace in Afghanistan, terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries in the region must be dismantled immediately and terrorist supply chains disrupted. It needs to be ensured that Afghanistan’s neighbours and the region are not threatened by terrorism, separatism and extremism.”He called for “zero tolerance” for all forms of terrorism, and said it is equally important to ensure Afghan soil isn’t used by terror groups to threaten or attack any other country. “Those providing material and financial support to terrorist entities must be held accountable,” he added.The world community should “decide on actions that would help bring a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire”, and ensure the Taliban “engage in negotiations in good faith, eschew the path of violence, severe ties with al-Qaeda and other terrorist organisations, and fully commit itself towards reaching a political solution”, Tirumurti added.The Indian envoy reiterated New Delhi’s support for an inclusive Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled peace process which leads to a political settlement that protects the gains of the past two decades and preserves the rights of women, children and minorities.The Afghan envoy to the UN, Ghulam M Isaczai, was more scathing in his criticism of Pakistan’s role in backing the Taliban, which he said was being assisted in acts of barbarism by “foreign fighters from trans-national terrorist networks”. The Taliban have launched more than 5,500 attacks since mid-April with support from more than 10,000 foreign fighters representing 20 groups, including al-Qaeda, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) and Islamic State.“Importantly, the Taliban continue to enjoy a safe haven in and supply and logistics line extended to their war machine from Pakistan. Graphic reports and video of Taliban fighters congregating close to the Durand Line to enter Afghanistan, fund-raising events, transfer of dead bodies for mass burial and treatment of injured Taliban in Pakistani hospitals are emerging and are widely available,” Isaczai said.“Consistent with the agreement of the leadership of Afghanistan and Pakistan in Tashkent last month, we urge Pakistan to help with removing and dismantling of Taliban sanctuaries and supply lines and establish with us a joint monitoring and verification mechanism to make the fight against terrorism and international efforts for peace effective and credible,” he added.Barbara Woodward, the UK envoy to the UN, said the Taliban must realise there will be consequences if it continues its military offensive. “There can be no military solution to this conflict. For our part, the UK will not recognise a Taliban government that comes to power by force,” she said.The US representative condemned the increase in violent attacks and said: “The Taliban must hear from the international community that we will not accept a military takeover of Afghanistan or a return of the Taliban’s Islamic emirate. The Taliban will be isolated and an international pariah if they choose that path, which would most certainly push the country to further violence and destruction.”The US representative listed five principles for a negotiated and inclusive solution, including inclusive governance, the right of the Afghan people to elect political leaders, protection of human rights, a commitment to counter-terrorism and no safe havens for foreign terrorists, and adherence to international and humanitarian laws.Special representative Lyons said the UN Security Council must issue an unambiguous statement calling for cessation of attacks on cities, and countries in contact with the Taliban’s political commission should insist on a ceasefire and a resumption of negotiations. The exemptions to the UN travel ban on Taliban leaders are for the sole purpose of peace negotiations, and further extension during a review on September 20 “must be predicated on real progress in peace”, she said.Following the statements by the 15 members of the Security Council, the meeting was adjourned for consultations behind closed doors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-accept-a-govt-imposed-by-force-in-afghanistan-unsc-101628271720285.html
07-08-2021||India||A year after Kerala crash, probe report still stuck||A year after an Air India Express plane crashed at Kozhikode in Kerala, killing 20 people including two pilots, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is yet to release a preliminary report on the cause of the mishap. Recently, the Centre informed Parliament that the report is likely to be released by the end of August.On August 7, 2020, a Boeing 737-800 aircraft arriving from Dubai overshot the runway at Kozhikode International Airport and broke into pieces, leaving several of 190 people aboard the ill-fated aircraft injured. Immediately after the crash, the government announced that the AAIB, which comes under the civil aviation ministry and has the mandate to investigate serious incidents and accidents involving Indian registered planes, will conduct a formal inquiry into the mishap.Days later on August 13, the AAIB announced the setting up of a five-member team to probe the circumstances that led to the plane crash. In a statement, the bureau said that the investigator-in-charge will complete its inquiry and submit the report within five months from the date of the issue of the order.A year later, the probe is yet to be completed and the cause of the mishaps remains unknown.On August 5 this year, the Centre informed Parliament that the AAIB probe is in “progress” and is likely to be completed by the end of the month.In a written reply to a query in the Lok Sabha, minister of state for civil aviation V K Singh said the final compensation offers had been made to all next of kin of the deceased but none of the “next of kin has sent their acceptance as of date”.According to experts, the findings of any probe report, besides fixing responsibility and accountability, also helps in taking corrective action and measures to prevent similar mishaps in the future.Mohan Ranganathan, former instructor pilot of Boeing 737 specialising in wet runway operations, said: “The preliminary report of an accident is supposed to be out in two weeks. However, there has been no status on it (Kozhikode crash report). The AAIB was asked to submit the investigation report five months after the crash, failing which a two-month extension was given in January but the report is not out yet.”Alleging that the AAIB has always failed to release probe reports on time, Ranganathan said, “Their reports always conclude by pointing out manual errors.”Even in the past, investigators have taken years probing aircraft accidents which, at times, are attributed to both lack of technology and required expertise.Citing the example of the Turkish Airlines’ aircraft accident that took place in Mumbai in September 2011, whose report is still awaited, Ranganathan said, “There cannot be any reason to delay a probe report for ten years. The functioning of the AAIB is very poor and needs immediate improvement.”A Turkish flight, TK 720, from Istanbul with 97 passengers and crew on board had skidded off the runway at Mumbai airport in September 2011. No one was injured in the incident.Echoing Ranganathan’s point of view, a veteran pilot on condition of anonymity said the competence of the investigating board should be strengthened with professionals having vast experience and the reports should be time-bound.“A time-bound investigation in any incident/ accident is required so that when anything has gone wrong, that should be remedied for the future and prevent their recurrence,” he said.The AAIB has a regular workforce of seven safety personnel and an independent panel of 23 pilots and cockpit crew, 12 engineers, four aviation operation experts, two experts each for aviation psychology and aerodrome and one expert each as in-flight safety personnel and air safety investigator.Asserting that Indian investigators are as competent as their foreign counterparts, the pilot said they need to further upgrade their skills through various courses in aircraft investigations.“In the foreign countries or western world, they (investigators) undoubtedly handle it (the probe) much more professionally,” a senior industry expert said, wishing not to be named.“Lots of facts and figures are examined along with factors such as flight safety, fatigue during anincident or accident. These investigators look into all factors, right from the aircraft serviceability to the competent pilots having cleared all medical records,” the expert said.“It is time that we have a more robust aircraft investigation board with more professionals from across fields, and they should be subjected to more aircraft investigation courses,” he added.The expert further pointed out: “There should also be no pressure, if you are an independent board. At times, the findings, irrespective of the nature, can get twisted if the airline involved is going to get a bad name. It shouldn’t matter and it should be a fair and absolutely honest investigation,”“Justice delayed is justice denied. If you take so long to come to a conclusion it’s as if there’s no accountability. There should be a timeline. Or you justify why you are late, so that these issues are addressed to the regulatory authority,” the pilot said.Queries sent to AAIB did not yield a response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/a-year-after-kerala-crash-probe-report-still-stuck-101628271240777.html
07-08-2021||India||Sarma, Sangma agree to resolve border dispute in a phased manner||The Assam and Meghalaya governments on Friday agreed to form three committees to resolve their long pending boundary dispute in a phased manner with the initial focus on the less complicated areas of contention.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and his Meghalaya counterpart Conrad Sangma, in a meeting in Guwahati, said the committees will be headed by ministers of both the states and will have five members from each side, including Cabinet ministers, bureaucrats and local representatives.“Both governments are clear that we want to resolve the differences between the states. There is a strong political will to find an amicable solution. Both agreed that the disputes should be resolved in a respectful manner,” Sangma said.This is the second meeting between the two chief ministers who earlier met in Meghalaya on July 23 to discuss the issue. While Meghalaya had already made a presentation on their views at the meeting in Shillong, the Assam government did the same on Friday.“The strategy we have decided to follow is to take up the matter in a phased manner. There are areas which are less complicated, some slightly more and some very complicated,” Sangma said.Of the 12 disputed areas, the six which will be taken up for discussion in the first phase are Tarabari, Gizang, Hahim, Boklapara, Khanapara-Pilangkata and Ratacherra. The areas fall under Kamrup, Kamrup (Metropolitan) and Cachar districts of Assam and West Khasi Hills, Ri Bhoi and East Jaintia Hills districts of Meghalaya.The remaining six areas of dispute are Langpih, Khanduli-Psiar, Deshdemoreah, Nogwah, Mawtamur and Borduar.“We don’t have any dispute from the Assam side but the problem arose because Meghalaya claimed certain territories in these 12 locations. When we met in Shillong, we agreed that all disputes can’t be resolved in one go and we need to take them up in a step-by-step manner. Once the six disputes are resolved, we will move on to the others,” Sarma said.“The committees will focus on historical facts, ethnicity, administrative convenience, sentiment of local residents and contiguity. Based on these parameters, they will try to find a way forward. The committees will make joint visits to the areas and submit their reports within the next 30 days,” Sangma said.Sarma and Sangma will also visit some of the disputed areas within the next thirty days, especially Langpih, one of the most disputed of the 12 areas.Based on reports of the three committees, the issue will be taken up at the chief minister’s level for a permanent resolution.“Resolution of the disputes should not require redrawing of boundaries. We believe the disputes are due to problems of perception on both sides. We are attempting to align our perceptions… But if in the process, any redrawing is necessary, the matter will have to be sent to the Centre and it can be done by Parliament,” Sarma said.Meghalaya was carved out of Assam in 1972. Over the years, differences have cropped up regarding the boundary and resulted in skirmishes among various communities inhabiting the border areas.Besides Meghalaya, Assam is also facing border disputes with Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland. Separate suits are pending in the Supreme Court for a resolution to the row with Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland.On Thursday, Assam and Mizoram agreed to withdraw forces from all disputed border areas and work towards lasting peace in the first meeting between the two states since an unprecedented gunbattle on July 26 killed six policemen and injured 41 others.Last week, Assam and Nagaland signed an agreement on maintaining the status quo along the borders.Last month, both Sarma and Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu had said that the two states would try to resolve the border dispute out of court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-meghalaya-agree-to-resolve-border-dispute-in-phases-101628246158822.html
07-08-2021||Today's||At UNSC, India’s values and interests converge||The United Nations Security Council (UNSC), with a mandate to maintain international peace and security, is the centrepiece of global multilateralism. It selects the UN Secretary-General and plays a co-terminus role with the UN General Assembly in electing judges to the International Court of Justice. Its resolutions, adopted under chapter VII of the UN charter, are binding on all countries.However, the UNSC’s governance structure — which was designed at the end of World War II and has five permanent members with a veto — needs reforms to reflect contemporary realities. This is essential for the sake of multilateralism and an effective UN.India was elected to the UNSC for the eighth time in 2020 and began its two-year term this January. It is the council’s president in August and is, rightly, using the pulpit to focus on areas of vital interest affecting international peace and security. The presidency also offers India an opportunity to underscore its credentials as the world’s largest democracy, an economic behemoth and underline its commitment to the UN, including as the largest contributor, over time, to UN Peacekeeping. This is a stellar record for a permanent place on the horseshoe table. In recent months, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi has underlined the imperatives for UNSC reforms and India’s strong stakes. It is, therefore, in the fitness of things that he will become the first Indian PM to chair a UNSC meeting on August 9. He will preside over the meeting, virtually, on the issue of maritime security, a subject which will be on the UNSC table for the first time for a comprehensive debate.Given the huge role of sea-borne trade in human wellbeing, ensuring freedom of navigation and safety on the seas is a global imperative. For India, maritime security is also important given its sea-facing geography and civilisational links developed over millennia through seafaring. It is, thus, once again in the fitness of things that India should push towards a comprehensive approach to maritime security.However, there is no universally accepted definition of maritime security, though it is generally accepted to include access to the global commons of the sea and preventing high seas crimes, including unregulated fishing. The UNSC has adopted several resolutions on different aspects of maritime security and related crimes.Internationally, countries are generally in agreement that access to the high seas, as part of the global commons, should be free, open, and inclusive. A rules-based international order that recognises national sovereignty and territorial integrity, apart from stressing environmental sustainability, is the need of the hour. It is also important that the world sees enhanced coordination among countries in responding to high seas crimes including piracy, trafficking, narco-smuggling and other non-traditional maritime security threats, and acts jointly to meet humanitarian commitments at sea.The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provides a general framework that could be built upon for a comprehensive approach to maritime security and guaranteeing of the seas as a global commons for the benefit of all. It is important that all countries agree to adhere to international rules governing the maritime domain and put them into effect nationally. Such an order should serve all nations, big or small, and ensure similar rights under international law to all.India’s month as the UNSC chair will also see high-level interactions on peacekeeping and counterterrorism. External affairs minister S Jaishankar is expected to travel to New York and preside in-person over these meetings, adding personal heft to India’s diplomatic efforts.The UNSC presidency rotates every month in alphabetical order among its members. India is likely to hold the UNSC presidency, once again, in December 2022, just before its present term at the UNSC ends. India will also be chairing the G-20 in 2023 and be part of its troika from next year. PM Modi’s personal involvement in the realm of reformed multilateralism is well known. Leadership at these forums would provide a special push both to multilateralism and to India’s quest for a place at the high table of global governance.Manjeev Singh Puri is a former ambassador and served as deputy permanent representative of India to the UNThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/at-unsc-india-s-values-and-interests-converge-101628340371520.html
07-08-2021||Today's||The unusual etymology of five simple words||This Sunday, I want to share my fascination for the English language. I’ve done it before, of course, but when third waves, winged horses, limping economies and less-than-thrilling Olympics are depressing our spirits, this could be the little boost you need. What I intend is not fiercely cerebral or complicatedly grammatical. Nor does it have anything to do with the illogical pronunciation of the language. It’s about five simple words we probably use every single day: Pretty, tall, silly, naughty, and sad. But it is about their etymology.Now, it’s not surprising to find that words change their meanings over time. For instance, to be gay today is very different to what that adjective meant in the 1920s. Mummy, as a 90-year-old, would often introduce generals with the line, “We first met when he was a gay young man”. For her, gay was always merry and carefree.A recent article by Simon Horobin, a professor of English at Oxford, reveals that, when they first came to be popularly used, each of the five words I’ve chosen meant something very different to what it does today. It’s a bit like “disinterested”. We use it to mean not interested. Originally, it meant impartial. Or “fulsome”. Historically, it meant insincere. Today, fulsome praise is taken as a compliment.Now, when “pretty” first entered the dictionary, as a derivative of a word from Old English, it meant cunning. By the 15th century, the word described something cleverly made or artful. Slowly, thereafter, it was used to call someone attractive or good-looking. But you still get hints of its origin when you remember it can be used ironically as in “pretty kettle of fish” and “pretty state of affairs”.“Tall” in Old English meant swift or active. By the 15th century, it came to mean handsome or elegant. Its usage relating to height began a century later. From there spring its metamorphic extensions to mean large as in “tall order” or exaggerated as in “tall story”.These changes in meaning may seem surprising but they’re really not. Professor Horobin says, “Several common adjectives that describe physical appearances began life referring to dexterity and pliancy”. “Handsome”, for example, originally meant easy to handle, while “clever” meant dexterous. Believe it or not, “buxom” meant obedient. That’s definitely no longer true!Let’s now come to “silly”. In Old English, it meant happy or fortunate. In due course, that became “pious” or “holy”. Then, says the professor, “because the innocent are easily taken advantage of it came to signal a person deemed weak or helpless”. Thereafter, it was used to suggest rustic or lacking sophistication. Its modern meaning of “foolish” was, I guess, the inevitable next step. But if you want to call me silly, I hope it’s in the original sense?In Old English, to be naughty was to be poor, literally to have naught or nothing. Perhaps this is why it was later used to describe someone as immoral and, in a weakened sense of that term, mischievous or disobedient. Today, the adjective is usually reserved for children. But its use to mean “indecent” survives. In the 1980s, Salman Rushdie used the word to coin a rather clever phrase “naughty but nice” to sell cream cakes. Monty Python created the term “naughty bits” to politely refer to genitals.“Sad” has, perhaps, the most strange etymology of all. In Old English, it meant “full”. These days, it’s been replaced in this sense by “satisfied” or “sated”. But in the 14th century, “sad” came to mean settled, firm or resolute. According to the prescient professor, the modern meaning sorrowful is, perhaps, a throwback to the Old English usage “where the word already carried a sense of being weary or tired of something, reflecting the way that satisfaction quickly shades into ennui”.Finally, try and make sense of this. I’m using the five words in their Old English sense. He was tall and pretty, I was naughty but silly, and both of us were sad!Karan Thapar is the author of Devil’s Advocate: The Untold StoryThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-unusual-etymology-of-five-simple-words-101628340370275.html
07-08-2021||Today's||Are voters delivering more decisive mandates?||Are Indian voters empowering governments with more decisive mandates? This is the emerging wisdom among many experts and observers of Indian politics. For instance, pollster Pradeep Gupta, in his book, How India Votes: And What It Means, has argued that new forms of technology are enabling increased communication between voters during the rough and tumble of the campaign period. This, in turn, is enabling voters to consolidate their opinions about a given candidate or party’s odds of winning, leading to a shift of support away from likely losers. Voters, the argument goes, are learning how to rally behind election winners, giving them supersized mandates.This thesis seems eminently plausible. A cursory glance at recent assembly elections suggests that landslides abound. The Aam Aadmi Party’s sweep in 2015 and 2020 in Delhi, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s 2017 victory in Uttar Pradesh, and the Left Front’s and Trinamool Congress’s decisive wins in Kerala and West Bengal, respectively, in 2021 — all point in the same direction. Yet anecdotes can be misleading. In fact, our analysis of historical data on Indian elections suggests that this popular wisdom may well be misguided.We looked at data from 249 assembly elections, taking care to code all parties and pre-poll coalitions in state polls going back to 1980. Because some parties that claimed to be in alliance did not actually adopt robust seat-sharing arrangements, we considered parties to be in a “true” coalition only if they did not run against each other in more than a handful of races.Additionally, because an election can be “decisive” in different ways, we calculated three different measures of “election decisiveness” — the seat-share margin between the winner(s) and runner(s)-up, the vote-share margin between the winner(s) and runner(s)-up, and whether the election resulted in a hung assembly.Using each of these three measures —across a range of specifications, including limiting our sample to only major states with larger populations — our results are strikingly consistent. Contrary to received wisdom, elections have largely been getting less decisive over time, although the effect is generally not statistically significant.After notching up larger mandates in the early 1980s, winning parties (or coalitions) exhibited an average margin of victory— in terms of seat-share difference between the winner and runner-up — of between 35 and 39% until the end of the 1990s. Margins of victory narrowed to roughly 32% in the first decade of the 21st century, rebounded to their earlier levels between 2011 and 2015 (39%), and finally fell back to their previous lows (33%). The data on vote-share shows the same broad trends, while the data on hung elections was more inconclusive. 18% of assembly elections between 1980-1985 failed to produce a clear majority winner. This figure stood at 30% in the late 1990s before dipping to 21% between 2016 and 2021.In other words, there is little evidence to suggest that elections have been getting more decisive over time. If anything, the data suggests the opposite — by some measures, election victories have been getting slightly narrower.This aggregate analysis looks at the average outcomes of state elections across India. However, while some changes, such as the rise of social media, might affect voters across India more or less equally, changes within particular states may be just as or even more important.Indeed, when we disaggregate election decisiveness by state, we see a great deal of regional variation. In states such as Gujarat, there is a relatively clear trend toward narrower election victories. Yet, in Uttar Pradesh, a shift toward narrower election victories in the 1980s and 1990s has since given way to a strong trend toward more decisive victories in the 2000s. And in other states, such as Andhra Pradesh or Bihar, there seems to be no clear trend in either direction.What might explain these findings, which seem to contradict the conventional narrative?One possibility is that new avenues for coordination and consensus among voters are being counteracted by forces that discourage communication and shared opinion. While social media might enable voters to converge on a shared body of information, for example, it might also separate voters into multiple, insular communities that increasingly diverge in their opinions and beliefs about the world— including which parties or candidates are likely to win.Additionally, while new technologies might enable certain forms of voter cooperation, they also provide political parties new avenues to make their case to the public and influence voters. This can allow more marginal parties to cling to a narrow support base even when they have little chance of winning outright.Another possibility is that voters are indeed voting more strategically but, given the inaccuracy of pre-election polling and the general uncertainty of election outcomes, there are limits to their ability to predict winners and losers in advance. Indeed, research on Muslim voting patterns suggests that coordinated bloc voting is regularly stymied by the powerful influence of local factors, which often weigh heavily on voters’ minds.While independent candidates and candidates from more marginal third parties may be easier to write off as unlikely to win — indeed, we find that this group is winning significantly fewer seats over time — if runner(s)-up continue to appear to be serious contenders, the typical margins of victory the winners enjoy will remain unchanged.Finally, even if Indian voters are voting more strategically, this effect could be offset by other factors known to influence election outcomes, from anti-incumbency to a “honeymoon effect”, whereby the electoral fortunes of the national ruling party contesting state elections will depend on whether or not the assembly election closely follows a general election. In this case, simply examining trends in “decisiveness” over time may be glossing over important variations in voter behaviour.Rather than seeking out universal explanations of how Indians vote, it may be more productive for election analysts to take a narrower, more context-specific approach. If we have learned one thing from decades of scholarship on Indian voters, it is that they have an endless capacity to defy simple narratives.Jonathan Kay is James C Gaither junior fellow and Milan Vaishnav is senior fellow and director, South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, DCThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/are-voters-delivering-more-decisive-mandates-101628340369011.html
07-08-2021||Today's||Indian foreign policy needs more women||Whenever India has undertaken big foreign policy engagements, very often, women experts and diplomats are conspicuous by their absence. Women account for only 16% of the Indian Foreign Service and only 18% of top leadership positions in embassies around the world.In a recent seminar on gender mainstreaming in India’s foreign policy, Ranjana Kumari, director, Centre for Social Research, spoke of how Indian foreign policy should become more gender-inclusive and adopt a feminist foreign policy (FFP) framework. Sweden, Canada, The Netherlands, and Mexico are countries which have adopted this framework and, she feels that India could benefit from doing so too.There is a misconception that women tend to veer away from what are described as hard issues of security and trade and focus on relatively soft issues. But today, nothing is considered a soft issue. Health, human rights, women and child trafficking, economic and political migration, and conflict are all issues that impact the security of nations. And it is in these that women’s voices must be heard much more.Former foreign secretary, Sujatha Singh, feels that gender inclusion in foreign policy could lead to changes in priorities. “It is impossible to separate any one issue from the larger canvas of national security today,” says Singh.An FFP framework would work to acknowledge women’s agency in matters of national and international import in dealing with other countries and organisations. The participation of women in foreign policy would strengthen democratic institutions and make them more inclusive, it would provide a fresh perspective on how we view the world, and how it views us. External affairs minister S Jaishankar says that the representation of women in his ministry is being actively promoted. “I agree that we need to look at the world from the perspective of women, we need a gender-balanced foreign policy. We need to look at three things here: Getting more women to engage with foreign policy issues, reflect women’s interests in foreign policy, and bring in a feminist perspective to foreign policy.” But he is not sure that the FPP as it exists in other countries can be replicated in India easily. “These countries have different cultures, different historical traditions. We need such a framework to evolve organically for it to work. But, yes, certainly, we need much more rebalancing in this area.”It is not as though India has been averse to the inclusion of women in what has been termed hardcore security issues internationally; the problem is that it has been piecemeal. An all-woman police force from India was deployed under the aegis of the United Nations (UN) in Liberia back in 2007. Such units have been sent to the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2019 as well as the Republic of South Sudan. Indeed, the role of women in conflict resolution and peace processes — vital cogs in foreign policy — cannot be understated. But so far, this has not become an integral part of the foreign policy and security narratives. Nandita Baruah, country head of The Asia Foundation, says “The FFP is aimed at giving voice to a gender perspective in foreign policy which, in turn, contributes to sustainable development and human security.”Much more needs to be done to include women at various policy levels in foreign relations. India is a member of the UN Commission on the Status of Women, a forum where India can influence gender perspectives globally. We need to lead by example. lalita.panicker@hindustantimes.comThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/indian-foreign-policy-needs-more-women-101628340364750.html
