Since July 29, the case was being taken up on daily basis on Punjab’s request. Kumar’s appointment was quashed by a high court single-judge bench in January 2018. The bench had held that Kumar was holding the public office without authority and overriding powers were given to him without any accountability. Following the order, Kumar had resigned but rejoined after the order was stayed by the division bench on February 14, 2018, acting on a plea from the state. The case could not be taken up for hearing between March 2020 and July 2021 due to Covid pandemic. A 1983-batch IAS officer, Kumar was appointed immediately after the Congress government took charge in Punjab in March 2017. The post created for the first time in the state was stated to be equivalent to a cabinet secretary of the central government. Kumar was being paid ₹2.5 lakh per month. His appointment was challenged by one Ramandeep Singh, claiming that Kumar had become a “de facto CM” and was empowered by the government to take decisions on behalf of the CM, which is illegal. Former finance minister and Supreme Court lawyer P Chidambaram appeared for Punjab. After hearing arguments from all parties, the matter was reserved for final verdict on Wednesday by the bench of justice AG Masih and justice AK Verma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-reserves-verdict-on-punjab-govt-s-plea-on-suresh-kumar-s-appointment-101628101727514.html
04-08-2021||Delhi||St Stephen’s College admission process begins today, no entrance test this year as well||The admissions process to various undergraduate courses at Delhi University’s St Stephen’s College will begin on Thursday. This year, too, the prestigious college will not be holding entrance tests, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and all interviews will be conducted in the virtual mode, college officials informed on Wednesday.St Stephen’s College, being a religious minority institute (it is administered by the Church of North India), has its own admission process, independent of the cutoff lists announced by DU, and reserves 50% seats for Christian students. After releasing cutoffs for its undergraduate courses, the college conducts tests and interviews, which together have a weightage of 15 marks. The remaining 85 marks are decided on the performance of candidates in their Class 12 assessment.However, in view of the pandemic, the college last year decided to do away with the test and conduct interviews online and give the entire 15 marks on the basis of the interview alone, a process which will be repeated this year as well. “The college has asked all departments to prepare question papers for entrance tests as a backup, but keeping in mind the pandemic situation it has been decided the college will not be conducting entrance tests this year as well and the interviews will be conducted in online mode. The prospectus and forms will be available on the St Stephen’s website from 10am Thursday,” said college principal John Varghese. The last date of submitting applications is August 31. St Stephen’s offers around 450 seats in 11 undergraduate courses, including BA (Hons) in English, History, Economics, Philosophy, Sanskrit, BSc (Hons) in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, among others. All applicants have to register with the Delhi University website before filling the St Stephen’s forms.Meanwhile, the college has started the registration process for admissions to its hostel for the academic session 2021-22. The last date of registration for availing of the hostel facility is Friday (August 6). In the application form the college has sought details about the vaccination status of candidates and asked them to upload the certificates, if vaccinated.“The idea is to collect data on the number of students who are vaccinated and who are not before the beginning of the academic session. The college can later facilitate vaccination of students who are yet to take the jab,” said a senior official at the college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/st-stephen-s-college-admission-process-begins-today-no-entrance-test-this-year-as-well-101628101726491.html

The department believes that as many as 80 per cent people connected with its feeders in the area were either indulging in power theft or deliberately not paying the power dues. Superintending engineer Ashutosh Srivastava said that an exercise of investigating these feeders had been undertaken by the department and the connections were being checked. Power theft was recently detected in 18 homes of Dariyabad and Khalifa Mandi localities by the power department teams. He said Kalyani Devi and Chakia were the worst affected areas with as many as 89.43% locals connected to the local feeders were not paying their electricity bills. Likewise, residents of those getting power through Khusrobagh sub station’s Daiarashah Ajmal feeder were second on the list with 85.93% of the residents either stealing power or not paying the bills closely followed by residents connected to the department’s Arya Kanya college feeder (85.77%) at third spot, officials said citing departmental records. The power department has identified 40 such feeders of Kalyani Devi, Karelabagh, Naini and Rambagh areas where substantial power was being consumed but the department was failing to get the due revenue. Superintending engineer Ashutosh Srivastava said that an exercise of investigating these feeders had been undertaken by the department and the connections were being checked. Power theft was recently detected in 18 homes of Dariyabad and Khalifa Mandi localities by the power department teams. Officials said that now an extensive metre reading exercise was being undertaken in these areas with police protection as in most of these places, the power department teams had to face opposition and even threats from locals. Officials also said that recently when the power department team reached Khalifa mandi to read the metres, they were refused entry inside the homes by the locals, which finally forced the sub-divisional officer of Khusrobagh to seek police help and undertake the task.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/power-thefts-prayagraj-south-under-power-dept-scanner-101628101666801.html

04-08-2021||Delhi||Rush for DU: Over 98,000 register for 70,000 seats within two days of portal launch||Two days after registrations opened for undergraduate courses in over 63 colleges of Delhi University, more than 98,000 students have registered till 8pm Wednesday for the 70,000 available seats, said varsity officials. According to data collated by the university till 5pm Wednesday, 88,994 students registered for undergraduate courses, while 81,610 registered for postgraduate courses, and 11,665 for MPhil and PhD programmes. Sanjeev Singh, joint director at the university’s computer centre, said the number of undergraduate registrations jumped to 98,994 by 8pm – exactly 48 hours after the portal was launched on Monday. While interested candidates can apply till August 31, university officials did not rule out the possibility of extending the deadline. Last year, the registration window was open for around three months with the result that the university received 353,000 applications, its highest tally till date.A senior university official, requesting anonymity, said, “Since CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education) is holding compartment exams between August and September, we will be waiting for a statutory decision from higher authorities on whether the registration deadline would be extended till then or not. DU entrance tests are also scheduled for September; so it is likely that the registration process might get extended.”Admissions to all undergraduate courses, barring 15, are conducted on the basis of merit and scores of the previous qualifying examination. Admissions to postgraduate, MPhil and PhD programmes, and the 15 undergraduate courses such as journalism, finance, and music, among others, are done through DU entrance tests (DUET), conducted by the National Testing Agency. This year, the entrance exams will be conducted in the last week of September.Since the admission process is completely online this year as well, the university has formed virtual help desks to address queries, including an interactive chatbot that has been introduced this year. “Most students want to ask about hostels, cutoffs, and whether they would get admission on the basis of their scores or not. We have also given the seat matrix of different colleges on the portal itself along with the annual fee for different courses. We have been holding virtual open houses as well to address queries of DU aspirants,” said Singh.Since DU does not follow a “first come, first-served” basis for undergraduate admissions, colleges are supposed to give admissions to all applicants who meet the announced cutoff criteria. With around 80% of DU applicants graduating from CBSE-affiliated schools, the cutoffs this year are likely to remain high. Around 220,000 students scored 90% and above marks in CBSE Class 12 this year, with around 70,000 of them scoring around 95% or more marks.Meanwhile, the varsity is also holding discussions on whether to conduct in-person classes for final-year students. “Discussions have been going on about conducting offline classes for students who need them. The final-year students, particularly those in science groups or requiring practical work, will be given priority followed by second- and third-year students,” said Rajeev Gupta, chairperson, admissions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rush-for-du-over-98-000-register-for-70-000-seats-within-two-days-of-portal-launch-101628101366438.html
04-08-2021||Delhi||Police report in Jaipur Golden hospital deaths a cover-up, say families of the deceased||New Delhi: A day after the Delhi Police told a court that the deaths of 21 Covid-19 patients in Jaipur Golden Hospital were not caused due to oxygen shortage, families of the people who lost their lives termed it a “whitewash” by the authorities and demanded a fair probe into the deaths.Erick Massey, whose mother Delphin Massey died at the Jaipur Golden Hospital allegedly due to oxygen shortage, said the hospital director clearly mentioned that they did not receive oxygen.“The Centre had recently said that there were no deaths due to lack of oxygen that were specifically reported by states and union territories during the second wave of coronavirus. They are fooling us. The death summaries mention respiratory failure or cardiac arrest. It’s written in a technical language. We are demanding a proper investigation,” he said.The hospital clearly said they were operating on reserves, Massey said, adding that it meant oxygen pressure was low and people on ventilators would not have survived on low oxygen pressure, he said.Massey also said that the hospital itself told the police that the average mortality rate per day before and after the incident was only two and three, respectively, which increased to 21 within a span of seven to eight hours.“I don’t think 21 patients have died in any hospital across India due to natural causes during the entire pandemic. It seems like a cover-up,” he said.Jagjyot Singh’s mother Sarabjeet Kaur was one of the 21 casualties on the fateful night of April 24 when the Jaipur Golden Hospital waited for its oxygen stock to be replenished.“It looks like a drama. They are fooling us. How the deaths happened should be investigated. We are not able to sleep at night. My mother has been murdered by the hospital. They are trying to blame everything on protocols,” he said.Navya Awasthi, whose mother Seema Awasthi, also died at the hospital, said that the report showed how the government was “more concerned about whitewashing” the matter than about the plight of people.“The hospital is saying that they had to resort to reserves, yet there is no death due to oxygen shortage. Aren’t these two statements contradictory? It is very easy to pass the buck. Whenever any committee looks at the reports, they will just show the records that say cardiac arrest or respiratory failure was the cause of the death. But what led to the cardiac arrest or respiratory failure of 21 patients,” she asked.In its status report in before a magistrate on Tuesday, the Delhi Police said the deaths at Jaipur Golden Hospital were not caused by oxygen shortage. “On scrutiny of death summaries of all deceased persons, it revealed that no death of patient was caused due to shortage of oxygen,” DCP Pranav Tayal told the court. In the same status, the hospital has stated that there was a link between inadequate oxygen supply and deaths of the patients as no oxygen was supplied to them for 30 hours despite several alerts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-report-in-jaipur-golden-hospital-deaths-a-cover-up-say-families-of-the-deceased-101628101006350.html

Soon after, the University of Mumbai (MU) issued a circular outlining the admission schedule. Sale of forms by colleges will commence on Thursday until August 14. Registration for pre-admission enrolment will be online on Thursday and will remain open till August 14. Aspirants can submit their pre-enrolment and admission forms starting Friday till August 14.With results for the higher secondary certificate exam announced on Tuesday, students and colleges had been awaiting clarity on how admissions to traditional courses such as Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Science (BSc), Bachelor of Commerce (BCom), etc were to happen. Following a meeting with vice-chancellors of non-agricultural universities, Samant on Wednesday evening tweeted that admissions to traditional courses would be based on aggregate marks scored by students in Class 12.A senior official from MU said, “Admissions will go on as usual. There will be no entrance exam. Merit lists will be prepared based on students’ marks in Class 12.”The first merit list will be issued on August 17, followed by the second list on August 25, and the third and final merit list on August 30. Every year, merit lists are drawn up based on scores of candidates in their Class 12 exams. However this year, in the absence of an actual exam and with the boards assigning moderated marks to students, some colleges had pushed for entrance exams. Principals had said that without entrance exams, preparing the merit list would be difficult and colleges would not be able to screen students well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/university-of-mumbai-opens-admission-to-traditional-courses-101628098550671.html
04-08-2021||Gurugram||New policy allows industrial clusters in agri zones||The Department of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) has announced a new policy to facilitate the setting up of industrial clusters and factories in agriculture zones across the state, officials said on Wednesday.Developers and owners of such units will need to pay change of land-use (CLU) fee and external development charges, calculated on the basis of the zone, a notification issued by Makrand Pandurang, the director of the town and country planning department, on July 30 stated.The prime reason for framing this policy is that many prefer to set up industrial units in agriculture zones or outside the controlled areas due to high plot costs in industrial estates developed by the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) and Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP), the notification stated.An order issued by Pandurang stated, “All cases related to grant of CLU permissions for setting up industrial unit/clusters in agriculture zones of hyper, high, medium and low category zones, towns be examined with aforesaid amendment.”A senior DTCP official said that this policy would ease the way business is done in the state as industry owners can simply plug and play their unit in a plot developed in a cluster, which can be done by a developer or a large company developing warehousing or infrastructure. “If an MSME [micro, small and medium enterprises] owner does not want to get into CLU permissions and other such issues, he/she can simply buy a plot in such a cluster and start work. The rate of plots in such zones would also be lower,” the official said, wishing not to be named.In Haryana, the urban areas in and around Manesar and Gurugram are classified as hyper zones, while the Faridabad-Ballabgarh complex, Panchkula, Kalka, Pinjore Gual Pahari-Balola Bandhwari complex in Gurugram district, Sonepat-Kundli urban complex and Panipat are classified as high-potential zones.According to the new norms, the minimum and maximum area for setting up an industrial cluster or warehouse range between two acres and 25 acres, depending upon the category of town. The minimum size of an industrial unit has been fixed at 0.5 acres and the cluster also must have an approach road of 18 metres. For individual units, the minimum area ranges from 0.2 acres to five acres. The industrial clusters or units must also be located at a distance of at least one kilometre from the urban areas of Gurugram.DTCP officials said that a sinking fund for the creation of infrastructure would also be created and owners or developers will have to pay external development charges to the department. A rebate would be given to the property owners depending upon the zone in which they set up the industry.Manmohan Gaind, the vice-president of Manesar Industries Welfare Association, said that this policy would be of immense help to industries provided the government also provides requisite infrastructure. “The rate of plots in urban areas is high and industry needs land at a reasonable cost. The catch is that electricity, roads and other facilities must be assured,” he said.Industry owners also said that getting CLU permissions should also be made easier.JN Mangla, the president of Gurgaon Industrial Association, said that financial incentives to industries, tax rebates and benefits on a par with the industries in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand should be given. “If the right amount of fiscal incentives are given, the industry will move to backward and rural areas and help generate revenue and employment,” said Mangla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/new-policy-allows-industrial-clusters-in-agri-zones-101628098549276.html
04-08-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19: Inoculation of health workers to be done by August 15||The health department is aiming to complete the vaccination process of healthcare workers by August 15 and expedite the process among front-line workers, officials said on Wednesday. With this, the vaccination coverage in the district is expected to reach almost 90%.“Some of the healthcare workers might have moved to other cities or taken their second shot in other centres or clinics or they might be outsourced employees. There could be multiple reasons for their pending vaccination status on Co-WIN. They will be contacted to enquire about their second dose inoculation and based on that, the vaccine beneficiaries list will be updated by government and private facilities. Once the list is revised, the vaccination coverage can go above 90%,” Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram said during a task force meeting held with private hospitals on Wednesday.According to data available on the Co-WIN platform, there are 50,185 healthcare workers, of whom 43,539 have taken the first dose and 39,657 their second dose. Of 54,437 front-line workers, 45,369 have taken the first dose and 33,644, their second dose.The Covid-19 vaccination drive started with the inoculation of healthcare workers on January 16, followed by the vaccination of frontline workers from February.To accelerate the vaccination among front-line workers, an action plan has been prepared by the health department. “A team of vaccinators and data entry operators will be constituted to visit different government departments to cross-check vaccination status and trace employees who are to be inoculated with the second dose. In a day, at least two departments will be covered in vaccination camps that will be held in the morning and evening. Departments can inform their workers a day in advance to take their vaccine shot,” said Dr MP Singh, the district immunisation officer.For the general population, private hospitals were directed to hold vaccination camps in localities where they conducted first-dose camps. “Hospitals need to ensure all those inoculated in these camps with the first dose should get their second jab in a timebound manner,” said Yadav.Hospitals were directed to submit an action plan in this regard to the health department.In the district, 1,889,344 doses have been administered since January 16, of which 1,447,495 were first doses and 441,849 were second doses, according to the data available on the Co-WIN dashboard.Based on the 2011 census, about 78% of the 1,741,000 population of the city has taken its first dose.On Wednesday, 7,632 vaccine shots were administered at government health centres and 9,689 at private hospitals. Currently, 30 of the 86 private hospitals empanelled with the state government are administering vaccines in the district.For the vaccination drive on Thursday, the health department has reserved 4,400 vaccine doses to be administered as the first dose and 5,250 as the second dose at government health centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19inoculation-of-health-workers-to-be-done-by-august-15-101628098548145.html
04-08-2021||Mumbai||At least allow fully jabbed on Mumbai local trains, passengers association demands||While the Uddhav Thackeray-led government has chosen not to reopen local trains for general public amid worries over safety, commuters are getting desperate in the absence of a transport network that can cater to such a huge number of travellers daily. The Mumbai suburban train network is shut due to Covid-19 pandemic for over 15 months. Before the local trains were closed for general public in April 2020, about 8 million people used to travel by the suburban network. The suburban network is a mass transit system spread across 456km and connects the city to the expanding Mumbai Metropolitan Region through 140 stations. With an annual ridership of nearly 2.9 billion, Mumbai’s local trains are one of the world’s busiest mass transit systems – 3,141 train services were operated on the Central and Western Railway before the pandemic. The network is suspended for the general public for the second time in over three months. Train services were suspended on April 15 after an increase in cases in the city. Earlier, the local train network was suspended for 10 months in March 2020 owing to the spread of coronavirus and resumed only in February 2021. However, even as the state partially lifted the lockdown restrictions from August 3, it chose not to reopen local train travel for general public. The decision of not allowing the general public to commute by local trains has irked passenger associations who had asked the Maharashtra government to permit fully vaccinated passengers to travel by local trains. The associations have stated that commuters approach them desperately daily. “Local trains are the only way through which the general public can commute. Not only do the trains save time, but it is also the most affordable public transport. The government is allowing shops to stay open till 10pm. People working in shops in the city come from areas like Thane, Mulund, Karjat and Kasara. They do not have the money to travel everyday by buses for hours to reach their workplace. This is why we have demanded that vaccinated passengers be allowed to travel by local trains,” said Subash Gupta, ex-member of National Railway Users Consultative Council (NRUCC) and president of Rail Yatri Parishad. Another passengers’ association has called for a protest at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) on August 15. “We will register our protest outside CSMT on August 15 by wearing black ribbons,” said Abhijeet Dhurat, president, Maharashtra Railway Passengers’ Federation. Physicians have however stated that despite being fully vaccinated, there is still a 30% chance of the infection. “The second wave has taught us that spots that saw gatherings in large numbers witnessed a spurt in the number of cases. At least 75% of Mumbai’s citizens need to be vaccinated with both the doses to achieve herd immunity. Mumbai is more densely populated than other cities across the world, which is why if the general public are allowed to commute, stringent checks of vaccinated passengers and increase in vaccinations have to be undertaken,” said general physician Dr Shahid Barmare. “The decision on allowing general public should be taken by doctors. The doctors and the government agencies will be able to analyse the risks and the benefits. Government agencies will also have to work to control crowds inside train compartments,” said urban planner Sulakshana Mahajan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/at-least-allow-fully-jabbed-on-mumbai-local-trains-passengers-association-demands-101628098546983.html
04-08-2021||Gurugram||Civic agencies to survey all trees, monitor growth||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will survey all trees in the city after the monsoon to track their growth, officials said on Wednesday.Subhash Yadav, the nodal officer for the environment and sustainability wing of MCG and GMDA, said that this will help the departments concerned track their growth better and help them locate dry or dead trees and also those that need attention. For the exercise, a mobile application developed by the GMDA to count and monitor the growth of trees will be used.“Every tree in the GMDA and MCG areas will be numbered and details, such as the size of the tree, the girth of tree, species, age and location, will be noted on the mobile application to detail the condition of each tree. After this process, if any tree falls naturally or is cut for some reason, the details will also be mentioned on the application,” said Yadav.Officials said that tenders for the exercise will be issued in October and after studying the database, interventions to improve the green belts in the city will be done on a bi-yearly basis. The data will also be shared with the forest department so that trees that are 70-100 years old can be given the necessary attention.Officials said that saplings planted this season will also be included and the work will start after monsoon to give them time to grow a bit.Vijay Dhasmana, an eco-restoration practitioner, said, “A tree census is good as it helps in understanding what is needed to improve the biodiversity of an area, especially in cities like Gurugram. But we also need to understand why trees die. I have noticed many trees dying on the Ghata road. These trees were brought from high moisture areas and planted here, due to which the weather, water or soil conditions do not match. Authorities should plant the right species for our ecosystem so that they survive.”In a related development, the forest department has allowed the GMDA to auction over 90 dead and dry trees from the Leisure Valley Park in Sector 29, Biodiversity Park in Sector 52 and Tau Devilal Park in Sector 22.Officials said that the dry trees are mostly used as fuelwood. “These trees are auctioned periodically as they can fall during stormy weather and lead to an accident. No green trees will be cut in the process,” a senior official of the GMDA said.Experts said that dead or dry trees can pose a threat to daily life, especially on busy traffic roads and residential colonies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/civic-agencies-to-survey-all-trees-monitor-growth-101628098545837.html
04-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi Metro's Pink Line to be longest corridor after Trilokpuri zone opens||Delhi Metro's Pink Line is all set to become its longest operational corridor from Friday onwards, which would also save time and money for commuters as after much-delay the Trilokpuri gap on the line has been plugged.The Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar corridor or the Pink Line spans 38 stations. However, a small portion in east Delhi's Trilokpuri area had proved a bottleneck for the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) authorities for a long time, due to which the line had remained disjointed for some distance there.The opening of the Trilokpuri section, about 289 metre, between the Mayur Vihar Pocket 1 and Trilokpuri Sanjay Lake stations, on August 6 will fully link the entire 59 km-long Pink Line for the first time.And, it will also connect important landmarks of the city, such as the Anand Vihar Railway station, Anand Vihar ISBT, Nizamuddin Railway station, markets in South Extension, INA and Lajpat Nagar, officials said.The much-delayed completion of Pink Line will also immensely benefit residents of east Delhi or people travelling to that region, as the gap at Trilokpuri was causing the corridor to be operated in two separate segments.The gap in the line was expected to be plugged by September 2020, but it had got delayed due to repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, sources had said early October.Pink Line was opened in multiple phases in 2018. And, all stations on the line have been opened.The bottleneck near Triloklouri station had arisen due to multiple issues, including land acquisition, resulting in a portion of metro segment, then about a few kilometres remaining incomplete, rendering the Trilokpuri Sanjay Lake station, a terminus.After its operationalisation on August 6, this section will connect the two ends of the Pink Line and provide seamless connectivity to a long range of localities in the National Capital Region. DMRC authorities on Wednesday said with this seamless connectivity, commuters will also save time and money.There will be reduction in travel time of about 20 minutes, from HUDA City Centre (Gurgaon) to Trilokpuri-Sanjay Lake or vice versa, as after opening of this section, there will be only one interchange station i.e. Delhi Haat-INA instead of two interchange stations as of now, officials said.Travelling from Raja Nahar Singh-Ballabhgarh (Faridabad) to Trilokpuri-Sanjay Lake or vice versa, will take 25 minutes less as after opening of this section, there will be only one interchange station i.e. Lajpat Nagar instead of two interchange stations presently.And, commuters travelling from NOIDA City Center or Botanical Garden to Trilokpuri-Sanjay Lake or vice versa, will save 20 minutes as after opening of this section, there will be only one interchange station i.e. Mayur Vihar Poket-1 instead of two interchange stations as on date.Also, their will be travel time reduction of about 20 mins both ways, on Delhi Haat-INA to Trilokpuri-Sanjay Lake or Lajpat Nagar to Trilokpuri-Sanjay Lake routes.The full connectivity of Pink Line will also save money for riders, as there will be reduction in fare by ₹30 for Trilokpuri to Mayur Vihar Pocket-1 section and vice versa, officials said."Reduction in fare by ₹20 will be in 38 sections (to and fro) and important key locations like Lajpat Nagar, Noida City Centre, Botanical Garden, Mohan Estate to Trilokpuri or vice versa; reduction in fare by ₹10 will be in in 524 sections (to and fro)," the DMRC said.Presently, 43 trains, including standby trains, operate on these two separate sections of Pink Line -- Majlis Park to Mayur Vihar Pocket-1 section has 30 trains including standby ones; Trilokpuri to Maujpur/Shiv Vihar has 13 trains, including standby ones, the officials said.After the integration of missing link, same set of trains will be utilised. However, detailed operational plan is yet being chalked out, a senior official said.The Pink Line is now going to be connected end-to-end, establishing it as the longest operational line of the network, he said.This corridor will further be extended from Majlis Park to Maujpur in Phase-IV, making it the longest single metro corridor in India at approximately 70 km. After completion of the Phase-IV, the Pink Line will also become the only Ring Corridor of Metro in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-metro-s-pink-line-to-be-longest-corridor-after-trilokpuri-zone-opens-101628097070823.html

They are angry as the state and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) have allowed relaxations in timings for all other establishments, except them. In Mumbai, the BMC has allowed extension in timings till 10pm for all shops, while hotels have been asked to stick to the 4pm deadline. Office-bearers of various hotel associations like Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), Indian Hotels and Restaurant Association (AHAR) and National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) met in Bandra and expressed strong reservations against what they called “discrimination”. Shivanand Shetty, president, AHAR, said, “We want to meet chief minister Uddhav Thackeray or tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray and want them to intervene. We are on a par with shopkeepers and should be allowed to run till 10pm till the situation stabilises.” Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, spokesperson, HRAWI, said, “The government should understand that it concerns the livelihood of both the owners as well as workers. There is no way we can continue like this.” He said the hotels are ready to follow all Covid-19 protocols. Protests have already started, as around 600 hoteliers from Boisar, Vasai, Virar, Palghar and Dahanu areas affiliated to HRAWI organised a silent protest. They submitted a memorandum to the Palghar collector demanding relaxation of timings. They pointed that last year, a hotelier from Virar committed suicide at his workplace due to the financial crisis during the lockdown.“We are facing a lot of pressure from our lenders,” said Pravin Shetty, a hotelier who took part in the protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-will-be-forced-to-protest-if-curbs-are-not-relaxed-hoteliers-warn-maharashtra-govt-101628098187651.html
04-08-2021||Lucknow||SHO shunted out after cab driver alleges harassment||LUCKNOW: Station house officer (SHO) of Krishnanagar police station, Mahesh Chandra Dubey, was shunted out on Wednesday in wake of the controversy over the harassment of a cab driver who was thrashed publicly by a woman at Awadh crossing here on Saturday. The driver had alleged harassment by cops and claimed that he was made to pay ₹10,000 to release his cab from the police station. The allegations were being looked into, said officials.Dubey was replaced by Alok Kumar Rai. The action came two days after an FIR was registered against the woman for assaulting the cab driver at the traffic signal near Awadh crossing.The Krishnanagar police had issued a challan to the cab driver and two of his relatives for breach of peace, after an altercation with the woman. The incident occurred when cab driver Sahadat Ali stopped his cab before the woman who was crossing the road near Awadh crossing.Apparently enraged over it, the woman started beating him after pulling him out of the cab before a traffic cop. Subsequently, the police penalised Sahadat and two of his relatives.However, when the CCTV footage of the incident went viral on Monday, several people took to social media saying that the driver was not at fault, yet he was assaulted by the woman in public. They also demanded immediate arrest of the woman.The cab driver filed a police complaint against the woman and wrote to the commissioner of police DK Thakur, alleging that he was also harassed by the police. Thakur sought a report from the Krishnanagar police station on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sho-shunted-after-cab-driver-alleges-harassment-101628098186452.html
04-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s BYL Nair Hospital to turn 100 next month||“I have seen the college grow with time from a sapling to a fragrant tree. Hundred years ago, it was just a one-storey building with 20 beds which has now turned into a major civic-run hospital. Now, when I look at the towering building of the hospital, it gives me goose bumps,” said Dr Rustom Phiroze Soonawala, a 93-year-old alumnus (1948 batch) of Topiwala National Medical College and its associated BYL Nair Charitable Hospital, Mumbai Central.On September 4, the hospital will turn a century old, holding testimonies of untold stories starting from the freedom movement, advancements in the field of medicine, and more recently the Covid-19 pandemic. On Wednesday, BYL Nair Hospital kick-started its month-long centenary celebrations with the inauguration of the genome sequencing machine by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. The hospital stands on Dr AL Nair Road, which is just a five-minute walk from Mumbai Central railway station. Every day, the hospital records more than 2,000 patient footfalls at their outpatient department (OPD). But very few know that this is the first hospital in the state that started with a nationalistic fervour, with the motto “For the Indians, By the Indians”, during the freedom movement against Britishers in the 1920s. Back in that time, the island city had only one medical college —Grant Medical College (GMC) with its attached Sir JJ Hospital. As India was still under British rule, Indian medical students and doctors faced discrimination at the hands of foreign faculty members at GMC.“Only a handful of Indian students were allowed to study medicine in GMC. But no Indian doctors were appointed at JJ hospital, irrespective of their academic excellence and dedication. It was at this time, that India was swept by nationalism under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi. Local nationalist leaders raised the need for a hospital free from discriminations,” said Dr Henal Shah, head of psychiatry department at Nair hospital.Through donations from Tilak Swaraj Funds, the National Medical College was established in a rented building of a pharmaceutical company in Byculla on September 4, 1921. As all medical colleges need to have a hospital to practice, People’s Free Hospital was set up at Chinchpokli with 20 beds. This laid the foundation of the first Indian medical college and hospital in the state.“Four years later, in 1925, Dr AL Nair, proprietor of Powell and Company which dealt in medical supplies and equipment, donated two acres of land, on which the hospital stands today. He also helped the hospital with equipment,” said Dr Rajan Nerurkar, head of pharmacology department of the hospital. It is this person after whom the road Dr AL Nair Road was named. Soon, the hospital faced a severe financial crunch and was struggling to function. “It was during this time that MN Desai, popularly known as Topiwala Desai, made a generous contribution of ₹5 lakh to the college. This initiated the expansion plan of the medical college along with its hospital,” said Dr Shah. “To honour him, the college was named Topiwala National Medical College.”But as the University of Bombay was under the control of the British, the National Medical College was affiliated with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Bombay. Students were admitted for Licentiate Medical Practitioner (LMP) course, which was just a diploma course in medicine. It was in 1946, when the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) took over charge of the hospital, University of Bombay affiliated the college and MBBS course was initiated the next year. “Since then, we have come a long way. Now, we have 16 buildings on the campus with a 1,400-bed hospital,” said Dr Rerurkar.Nair hospital is also the first civic-run hospital that performed open cardiac surgery in Mumbai, procured the first CT scan machine and started India’s first audiology and speech therapy. The hospital’s contribution during the Covid-19 pandemic is also phenomenal. It was the first hospital that was converted into a dedicated Covid hospital in Mumbai in April 2020. The microbiology team of the hospital runs the molecular diagnostic reference laboratory in Kasturba Gandhi Hospital, Chinchpokli — one of the high-tech laboratories in the state. On March 11 last year, the laboratory detected the first confirmed Covid-19 case in the city.“Since the outbreak of the virus last year in March, we have treated over 18,000 Covid-19 patients. We were the model Covid-19 hospital where around 600 resident doctors along with specialists worked round the clock for Covid patients,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of the hospital. “We also made records by delivering over 1,000 babies of Covid-infected mothers,” he added.“We have recently procured genome sequencing machines which will help us identify unknown variants of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. We are the first laboratory in the city to do genome sequencing,” said Dr Jayanti Shastri, in-charge of the lab and head of the microbiology department of Nair hospital.A month before it turns 100, Dr Ajit Desai, a senior cardiologist and an alumnus of 1971 batch said, “Nair is not just a medical college, it is an emotion to us. We are what we are because of the faculty. Even after so many years, the alumni of the college are closely associated, like a family. I am proud of my college.”“In our college days, we didn’t stress about grades”Dr Rustom Phiroze Soonawala was 20-years old when he sought admission at Topiwala National Medical College, which was then named National Medical College, in 1948. He did not at the time that after 43 years, he would be awarded Padma Shri for his work in the field of family planning. His father, Phiroze Framji Soonawala, was the head of medicine at the college. When he was younger, he would often accompany his father to the hospital, which developed his inclination towards medicine. The college started MBBS degree course in 1947 and his elder brother Jamshed Phiroze Soonawala took admission in the first batch. Next year, he enrolled for the degree as well.Talking to HT, the 93-year-old gynaecologist said, “During our time, there wasn’t so much pressure of grades. We were motivated by our passion. I had only scored 51% but got through the medical college. Those were the best days of our lives.”Along with their medical studies, the students were equally involved in extra-curricular activities, especially sports. Each year, the students competed with the other two medical colleges— Grant Medical College and Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College. “Students from Nair college always outshined in sports. We had medical students who had even performed at state-level in tennis and football,” he said.During his batch, there were around 50 students who were pursuing MBBS with him. “We enjoyed our life along with studies. There was no unhealthy competition. The group was small, so we stayed like a family. The focus was more on practical than grades, which helped mould us into better doctors,” he said. He said he gets nostalgic when he visits his college and passes by places where he used to hang out with his friends. “With every passing year, we have grown together. Now, the college has so many buildings, beaming with young students who remind me of my old days,” he said. In 1991, he won Padma Shri for introducing an Intrauterine contraceptive device that allowed women to plan their pregnancy. He has also been well associated with the Hindi-film industry for years. He delivered celebrity children including Ranbir, Kareena and Karishma Kapoor.“Nair is an emotion to us” To well-known cardiologist Dr Ajit Desai, Topiwala National Medical College is not just an educational institute but an emotion. He recalls how he along with his friends would hang out on a small porch at the expanding college campus. He was nominated for Padma Shri in 2018.Desai joined the college in 1971 along with 70 other students. “That group had become a family. We had a tremendous bond. There was a certain admission quota for students from Africa, so we really enjoyed the amalgamation of cultures,” he said. Along with studies, the college has several co-curriculum activities including drama. Every year, for four days, students used to organise dramas at Rabindranatya Mandir. “As the campus was still limited, we had one porch where, during off-duty hours, we used to sit with friends. So many love stories between the students started from there who are happily married together,” he said. In 2005, the TM Nair Medical College Global Alumni Association was established. “Even after years of graduating, the alumni who live in different parts of the globe are closely associated with each other,” said Dr Desai, who is the president of the association. Until 1994, students with 15 years of residency in the city were qualified for admission. “Now, students from all across the country come to study at the premier medical college which has a remarkable teaching faculty,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-byl-nair-hospital-to-turn-100-next-month-101628098005583.html
04-08-2021||Mumbai||Elghar Parishad: HC reserves orders on Sudha Bharadwaj’s default bail plea||The Bombay high court (HC) has concluded hearing the petition of Elgar Parishad accused Sudha Bharadwaj and reserved its order. Bharadwaj had sought default bail in light of the fact that the November 2018 order authorising the charge sheet and extension was illegal, as the judge who signed the orders was not competent and only a special judge under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act could have heard the same as she was booked under a scheduled offence under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The state and NIA, however, refuted the claims and stated that though the offences were under the UAPA till the investigation was taken over by NIA pre-trial procedures could be heard and decided by the sessions court. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, while hearing the bail application of Sudha Bharadwaj and the appeals by eight other Elgar Parishad accused, was informed by advocate Dr Yug Choudhry that the default bail application was in light of the fact that the charge sheet authorisation and extension in November 2018 were granted by sessions judge KD Vadane who was merely an additional sessions judge, but claimed and signed as a special judge. Choudhry had submitted that the information had been received through multiple queries under the Right to Information Act from the HC registry which showed that at the time of passing the orders Vadane was not a special judge. Choudhry had submitted that apart from the orders of Bharadwaj, orders for eight other Elgar Parishad accused were also signed similarly, hence there was illegality in the orders and Bharadwaj was eligible for default bail. He submitted that as per the NIA Act only a special judge could preside and decide on proceedings for offences under the UAPA. After the bench verified the submissions, the state had argued that while there was an irregularity in Vadane passing the orders, there was no illegality as claimed by Bharadwaj and submitted that as per rules the application filed by Pune police for authorising the charge sheet and extension could be heard by a sessions judge or even a magistrate though the offences may be under UAPA. The NIA through additional solicitor general Anil Singh had argued that the question of a special judge presiding over hearings would be applicable only after the NIA took over the investigation or the trial had commenced. He supported the state argument and said that there was no illegality in Vadane signing the orders. He also submitted that the application for default bail was not valid till 90 days for applying, as the same had not expired since Bharadwaj was arrested as she had been kept under house arrest for a few days. Those days could not be taken into consideration while calculating the days of arrest. The arguments concluded on Wednesday and the bench reserved its orders, which will be passed in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/elghar-parishad-hc-reserves-orders-on-sudha-bharadwaj-s-default-bail-plea-101628097345299.html
04-08-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19: Why is double masking important now more than ever?||Wearing two masks at a time is an effective technique to improve the fitting and protection provided to the face. Yet, as Covid-19 cases decline in Mumbai, many of us who had started using double masks, have now returned to single masks. Double face coverings, however, are important now, more than ever, as the highly infectious Delta variant continues to spread at the same time when the city is unlocking, and only 10% of the city’s population is fully vaccinated. As we breathe, talk, cough or sneeze, we expel tiny droplets into the air. Masks mainly help in trapping these droplets into the fibrous layers. The wearer of the masks is not only protected from coming in contact with such droplets suspended in the air or from a direct splash while interacting with someone, but they also prevent letting their own droplets out into the air. But all of this depends on the type and fitting of the masks. An Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bhubaneshwar study published in the journal Physics of Fluids last month stated that combining two masks provides an additional layer of protection and better fitting to minimise the leakage of droplets expelled during coughing, sneezing, talking, and breathing. Such leakages may cause the airborne transmission of the Covid-19 virus. The researchers used mannequins along with breathing simulators for the study. They used a combination of water and glycerin to create a fog in order to visualise the droplets. After thoroughly analysing the various combinations of masks, the IIT researchers concluded that a combination of N95 and a cotton mask was the best for safety as well as breathing comfort. While other combinations like surgical mask and N95 or surgical mask and cotton mask minimised leakage, the wearer required more effort to breathe. According to an IIT Bombay study published in October 2020, a cough of a Covid-19 infected person can contaminate a large volume of surrounding air with the virus. The size of cough clouds is nearly seven times smaller when one wears a surgical mask and nearly 23 times smaller with an N95 mask, the study stated. “With an additional mask, one can further reduce the contamination,” said Rajneesh Bhardwaj, associate professor, department of mechanical engineering at IIT Bombay and co-author of the study. As offices open up, mandatory double masking in closed environments can help in reducing the risk of infections. Medical experts are rooting for double masking for many reasons- to be in control of the anticipated third wave, to reduce the possibility of going under full-fledged lockdowns in the future and let the city gradually get back to the pre-Covid-19 levels. “One mask does not seal the area around the nose and mouth properly,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, an intensive care specialist and member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force. “It is the second mask that helps seal the mask underneath. Also, when the mask inside becomes moist due to sweat, the outer mask continues to offer some protection,” he said. Graphic: Basics of masking -Make sure your mask fits snugly against your face. -Gaps can let air with respiratory droplets leak in and out around the edges of the mask -Pick a mask with layers to keep your respiratory droplets in and others’ out -A mask with layers will stop more respiratory droplets from getting inside your mask or escaping from your mask if you are sick Wearing two masks -Use a cloth mask that has multiple layers of fabric -Wear a disposable mask underneath a cloth mask -The cloth mask should push the edges of the disposable mask against your face- Make sure you can see and breathe easily Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-why-is-double-masking-important-now-more-than-ever-101628097046058.html

The vaccination drive will resume across the city on Thursday. The drive was paused at the over 300 public vaccine centres across Mumbai on Wednesday owing to a shortage of vaccines. The drive continued as usual at private vaccine centres where the stock of vaccine doses was available in storage. Mangala Gomare, executive health officer of the civic body’s public health department said, “There may be a total of around 15,000-20,000 vaccine doses available at private vaccine centres on Tuesday. The fresh stock we have received will be distributed to vaccine centres on Wednesday. Vaccination will resume on Thursday.” BMC chose not to restart vaccination in the second half of Wednesday, unlike earlier, where vaccination would resume for the day post 2pm after the stock had been distributed in the first half. Gomare said, “We don’t want to conduct the afternoon session, due to problems of overcrowding at some centres. A full session will be held on Thursday.” On Tuesday, 22,758 beneficiaries received this first dose, and 12,049 beneficiaries received their second dose, across 428 vaccine centres. Of these 294 are operated by BMC, 20 by the state or Central government, and 114 are private.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaccination-to-resume-on-thursday-mumbai-civic-body-gets-57-000-covishield-48-000-covaxin-doses-101628096568468.html

04-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees 6,126 new Covid-19 cases, 195 deaths||Even as the state government rolled out relaxations from the lockdown curbs from Tuesday by allowing shops to operate for a longer period, restaurants to operate even on weekends, the state administration is wary of the rise in the daily caseload. The district and municipal corporations have been directed to not lower their guards and ensure that the lockdown and Covid-19 protocols are followed properly.Keeping its trend of daily caseload, Maharashtra reported 6,126 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday taking the tally to 6,327,194 and the death toll to 133,410 with 195 fresh deaths. The state has 72,810 active patients, of which Pune tops with 15,216 patients, followed by Thane with 5,984 and Mumbai with 5,034 patients. Around 447,681 people are under home quarantine, while 2,928 are in institutional quarantine.The daily test positivity rate on Wednesday was 2.89% as 6,126 of 211,678 tests were declared positive.As part of its Mission Begin Again, the state government has started rolling out relaxations from the curbs imposed for the last four months. Barring 11 districts with the high positivity and growth rate, the relaxations have come into effect from Tuesday. According to the presentation made by the health department on Tuesday, the positivity rate in 10 districts is above the state rate of 3.53%. Satara (7.56%), Sindhudurg (6.73), Sangli (6.37%), Pune (6.31%), Kolhapur and Ahmednagar (6.01%) are among the highest weekly positivity rate. Most of these districts have a high growth rate of over 0.30% against the state rate of 0.10%. As of August 1, the number of active patients in Maharashtra was 78,962, while 32,380 patients are admitted to various hospitals. Around 11,931 patients are serious, with 4,418 of them being treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). Of the total serious patients, 1,692 are on ventilators, while 2,726 are on oxygen support.Amid the relaxations, the state government is apprehensive about the possibility of the rise in daily caseload due to crowding at the public places. “It has been witnessed that whenever we open up the activities, the number of cases start increasing in a week. After opening up the local trains for all in MMR (Mumbai Metropolitan Region) on February 1, the daily caseload in MMR started surging from mid-February. Though the crowding at the public places is witnessed rampantly by violating the curbs, the relaxations rolled out will result in more crowding, leading to the rise in infection. The enforcement authorities need to be more vigilant while implementing the relaxations,” said an official from the health department.Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said that the local authorities of the districts with high positivity and growth rate of infection have been directed to follow the set protocol and increase the rate of vaccination to avoid the severity of the infection.“The positivity rate in districts like Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur and Pune is too high comparing the state average and in some districts, it is around 9%. We have directed them to follow the protocol related to the tracing, testing of the high and low-risk contacts to keep the spread in check. The recent flooding in these districts had affected the isolation, but the situation is now coming to normal. We have also directed these administrations to increase the rate of vaccination so that herd immunity is achieved soon. It has been witnessed across the globe that the high rate of vaccination helps in reducing the infection rate and also keeps the severity in check,” Tope said.Tope said that the district administrations have been directed to ensure that the Covid-appropriate behaviour should be maintained after rolling out the relaxations from the lockdown curbs. “Local administration is expected to ensure that the curbs are followed appropriately while implementing the relaxations. It is sometimes difficult to follow the norms properly. But we are apprehensive about the rise in the cases as the festive season is approaching. The threat of the third wave is looming large though nobody knows when it will hit us. Against this backdrop, it is important to follow the set protocol for all of us,” he said.Meanwhile, Mumbai reported 359 new cases and nine deaths taking the tally to 736,016 and the toll to 15,920. Pune (1014), Sangli (783), Kolhapur (412), Ratnagiri (212) were among the districts to report more cases on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-6-126-new-covid-19-cases-195-deaths-101628096265236.html

04-08-2021||Other||Smuggled liquor reaches dry Bihar via UP||LUCKNOW Smugglers have evolved a system to sneak in illicit liquor sourced from Haryana and Punjab into the dry state – Bihar via Uttar Pradesh. A bottle of smuggled liquor costing just ₹350 in Haryana is sold for anything between ₹2,500-3,000 while a bottle of country-made liquor costing ₹80 in UP is sold for ₹500-700 in Bihar, according to police and excise officials.These gangs procure liquor illegally from distilleries in other states and store it at different places in UP before sending it to Bihar. In doing so, they earn huge profits that fuels the network, they said. As per an estimate, these profits run into billions, luring new smugglers into the crime every day, said a senior UP Special Task Force (STF) official.“The smuggled liquor is transported mainly by road in Uttar Pradesh and stored at different warehouses located in the cities along major national highways before being transported into Bihar,” said DK Singh, DySP, STF. He said the STF busted one such warehouse in Kanpur earlier this year. The STF, along with the police, often intercepts these consignments and recovers huge cache of liquor but a lot more remains to be done. PRODUCT & SOURCE Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) is the most sought-after product for smuggling because of its high demand, easy availability and huge profit margins. Smugglers usually prefer liquor from Haryana, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh for its cheaper price.“The gangs have ties with corrupt officials in the managements at distilleries in districts of Haryana like Panipat, Sonipat and Palwal. This liquor is either smuggled directly into UP or is mixed with country-made liquor by gangs for better profits,” said S Anand, SP (Shahjahanpur) who has busted over a dozen liquor smuggling rackets passing through his district this year.Smaller vehicles are used to smuggle liquor in batches into UP. “After entering Uttar Pradesh, they load the liquor on to bigger vehicles to transport it to warehouses in cities like Kanpur, Lucknow, Varanasi and Prayagraj,” said the officer.THE TRANSIT The gangs hire transporters or even use their own vehicles to transport the liquor across UP.“For transporting large quantities, the gang members try to conceal the liquor under other items in trucks. The bigger trucks travel with permit, claiming to be transporting fruits or other perishable items to pass through the check posts,” informed S Anand.He said the duration of transit in UP before being sold in Bihar can range from a few days to months, depending on the conditions and availability of resources.“The gangs try to keep the transit within the state and avoid crossing the border in one journey. After being brought to UP, the liquor is first taken to a large warehouse, then to a smaller warehouse in districts bordering Bihar before crossing into that state,” informed the officer.ENTERING BIHAR The gangs take advantage of the porous UP-Bihar border to smuggle liquor into the dry state. Then they employ small-time smugglers to transport liquor into the state in small batches.Neeraj Kumar, SP, Buxar (Bihar) said: “The liquor is smuggled into Bihar by smugglers on foot, motorcycles, carts, tempos, boats and pick-up vans. In most cases large quantities are avoided. The liquor is sold locally within a few hours.”In districts like Buxar, Saran, Siwan and Gopalganj, 150 FIRs under prohibition act are lodged every month on an average and a majority of these pertain to smuggling of liquor.“In most cases, we found that local smugglers in Bihar travel to nearby districts in UP and bring back smuggled liquor with the help of others. We have also arrested natives of UP and Rajasthan for smuggling liquor. An anti liquor task force (ALTF) has been formed to act against these smugglers,” said Amrit Raj, IG of Bihar (prohibition). The Bihar police are also coordinating with UP and Haryana police to nab the masterminds of the gang. “Deputy SP level talks are held regularly between UP and Bihar police in bordering districts. Acting against liquor smugglers and sharing intelligence on them is a major part of these meetings. We are also closing in on people who operate the nexus while sitting in another state or abroad,” said the IG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/smuggled-liquor-reaches-dry-bihar-via-up-101628095424966.html

In this context, the DGP has issued instructions to give them special training. Now, 200 policemen will be imparted behavioural skills online by experts. Rude and violent behaviour by cops often causes problems and brings embarrassment to their superiors. Moreover, it displays the image of cops as being bad-tempered and unfriendly. In a recent incident, an argument took place between a trader and a sub inspector in Chowk area and the SI slapped the trader, causing outrage among other traders. The Vyapar Mandal leaders reached Kotwali and demanded action against the SI. A high court official and his family were stopped near Azad Park while they were going in their car. The inspector posted at Colonelganj police station told them to use alternate route but did not give any reason. The inspector also allegedly misbehaved with the official. Police officials were summoned over the issue following which the inspector was suspended. Similar incidents are frequently reported from different parts of the district. Complaints of misbehaviour are common during vehicle checking drives and raids. Taking serious note of such complaints, DGP Mukul Goel has asked senior police officials of the state to provide behavioural training to policemen to make them people friendly.. SSP Sarvshrestha Tripathi said soon policemen would be given training to improve their soft skills and attitude towards citizens. As it was not possible for a large number of cops to assemble due to Covid threat, they would be given online training in batches of 200. During Kumbh 2019, month-long special training sessions were conducted for policemen to train them how to behave with devotees from across the globe. The training included personality development and soft skills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/now-cops-to-get-lessons-in-soft-skills-101628094585847.html

The number excludes six to eight cubs, HK Rai, wildlife conservator and field director of VTR, said.In 2006, the number of big cats in the VTR has dropped to just 10. “Preliminary estimates put the population of big cats at 40. Around six to eight cubs have also been spotted in the forest area,” Rai said, adding that measures were being undertaken to make official the tiger population by National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) next year. VTR officials are planning to track tigers from October with the help of 500 CCTV cameras for 45 days in one of the two divisions.Spread over an area of 900 square kilometres, VTR is broadly divided into two divisions and has a 150-km-long perimeter with 120 villages on its fringes and 350 villages in the sensitive zone. “Hence, apart from protection, the development of habitat is one of the core activities the department has undertaken in a bid to raise the number of tigers. In addition to 54 anti-poaching camps, there are tiger trackers and around 100 forest guards to keep a tab on activities in the forest,” said an official, wishing anonymity.The forest area, which is divided into eight ranges, has 22 water holes and 8% grassland. “While the total number of bears ranges between 400 and 450, the leopard population has gone up to 98. Again, the forest has witnessed the rise in number of Indian bison (between 250 and 300),” said Rai.On February 19, 2021, a tigress, that was captured from VTR after it killed three villagers in West Champaran, died at a zoo in Patna. On January 30, 2021, a tiger’s carcass was recovered near Sirisiya forest area under Gobardhana forest range of VTR. Earlier, a tigress was found dead in Raghiya forest range of VTR on January 1, 2020.Meanwhile, the government has reduced the budget annual plan of VTR’s operation to ₹10.60 crore (2021-22) as against ₹14.60 crore in 2020-2021.InfographicsTigers’ count: 32 (as per 2018 Census) Cubs: Around nineDeaths after last census: 1 tiger, 2 tigressesCurrent estimateBig cats: Over 40 Cubs: 6 to 8Population of other animalsBears: 400 - 450Indian Bison: 250 - 300Leopards: 98The VTR is spread in an area over 900 square kilometres.

04-08-2021||Patna||Tardy pace of strategic Indo-Nepal border road due to poor planning: CAG||A recent audit report of Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India for the year ending March 31, 2019 has highlighted tardy progress of the Indo-Nepal border road project, which entails 552.9km-long construction in Bihar to provide mobility to Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) forces deployed there.The overall responsibility of the project is with the Road Construction Department (RCD), while the Bihar state road construction corporation is responsible for preparation of the detailed project reports (DPRs) for different stretches.“Due to poor planning, resource management and for want of preparatory work such as land acquisition, DPR finalisation, statutory clearances etc., only 4% of the total Indo-Nepal border road could be completed by October 2020. Besides, even after 10 years, 64% of the border outposts remain unconnected to the main alignment, which was altered by the RCD in 2011 to make it five to 40km away from the international border in four districts. Due to further change in alignment in a few stretches in 2016, at least 15 bridges costing ₹146.06 crore were delinked from the main alignment and remains unutilized. The Cabinet Committee (CC) on security, Government of India, in 2010 approved the project for construction of 1377-km road, which included the 552.9km stretch in Bihar. It was to run parallel to the international border,” says the report, tabled in the Bihar Legislative Assembly on July 29.The report also negated the department’s claim to have acquired 2497.64 acres of the total required 2759.25 acres land, as it allegedly awarded the contract for construction of road for the entire stretch of 552.29km without ensuring availability of land.“Acquisition of land was actually not complete, as ownership was legally not transferred to the government due to non-completion of mutation process. In East Champaran, the land acquisition process lapsed completely and delayed application of emergency provision for land acquisition escalated the cost by ₹1,375.33 crore and delayed the project by at least five years,” the report says, adding that instances of excess payment of ₹104.33 crore due to misclassification of land, excess payment of ₹45.36 crore to land owners without ensuring verification of genuine claims were also noticed.The audit report also pointed out that third party quality check, as required as per CCs instruction, was not carried out. The CAG did not accept the department’s reply that the flying squad of the department was being considered as the third party. “Flying squad was internal to the department and hence not the third party,” the audit noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/tardy-pace-of-strategic-indo-nepal-border-road-due-to-poor-planning-cag-101628093803952.html

04-08-2021||Patna||Bihar’s smaller pvt health firms may be left out of vaccine supply chain||Manufactures of Covid-19 vaccines may overlook the interest of smaller private health care centres in Bihar, as the minimum benchmark they have set for entertaining supply orders is way above the requirement of private facilities. Manufacturer of Covishield, the Serum Institute of India, has reportedly set a minimum limit of 6,000 doses for entertaining any supply order. Similarly, Bharat Biotech, manufacturer of Covaxin, and Dr Reddy’s, manufacturer of Sputnik in India, have set a minimum supply limit of 1,000 doses each for private firms identified by the government for administering the Covid-19 vaccines, claimed Dr Satyajit Kumar Singh, managing director of the Ruban Memorial Hospital, on Wednesday. According to an official in the state health department, logistics-related issues involved in supply of vaccines might be the reason behind the manufacturers’ minimum limit on purchase orders.Dr Singh’s hospital is in touch with all the three manufacturers for supply of Covid-19 vaccines. When contacted for confirmation on the minimum supply limit, all the three manufacturers were silent on HT’s queries. According to Dr Singh, the minimum purchase limit set by the vaccine manufacturers would suit only corporate hospitals. “It is difficult for smaller hospitals like ours to get the vaccines by paying a hefty amount in advance,” he said. For private centres, the government has capped the maximum per dose price at ₹780 for Covishield, ₹1,410 for Covaxin and ₹1,145 for Sputnik V.“We took a bank loan of ₹30 lakh to make advance payment for the vaccines last week after the Serum Institute told us that we have to place a minimum supply order for 6,000 doses, equivalent to 600 vials,” said Dr Singh. In June, the hospital placed an order for 1,250 doses, of which Covishield accounted for 1,000 and Covaxin for 250 doses. However, the hospital never got the vaccines. The hospital then paid ₹ 9.45 lakh for the vaccines through the government’s National Health Authority portal. The money was later refunded in July. Another health institution board, the Mahavir temple trust, which runs the Mahavir Cancer Sansthan, the Mahavir Vatsalya Aspatal and the Mahavir Arogya Sansthan, has adopted a “wait and watch” policy. “Initially, we applied for 3,000 vaccine doses, but government authorities asked us to prune our order. We then placed orders for 100 doses, but never got any vaccine and the money was refunded,” said Dr LB Singh, medical superintendent of the Mahavir Cancer Sansthan. “We can place a bulk order and distribute the vaccines among our three hospitals. But, we want to be sure this time. We will wait for a government advisory,” added Dr LB Singh. Meanwhile, the Paras hospital, which has a chain of at least five hospitals across India, is getting the vaccine supply from its corporate office in Gurgaon. “We got 10,000 doses of Covishield in June from our corporate office that we distributed among our units in Darbhanga and Ranchi. We expect another second round of vaccines soon,” said Dr Syed Asif Rahman, medical superintendent of Paras-HMRI hospital in Patna. In June this year, the state government empanelled 76 private hospitals in Bihar for vaccination, but barring three corporate hospitals, none received any vaccine either through the government channel or directly from the manufacturers. Ten private hospitals in June showed interest in procuring the vaccines. However, their supply order was as less as 10 doses to a maximum of 1,250 doses. They did not get the vaccines and their money was subsequently refunded. “Private firms in Bihar are reluctant as they are unsure of vaccine consumption, given the fact that the jabs are given free to beneficiaries at government centres. Bihar is not Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru or Hyderabad, where people belonging to the high income group don’t mind paying for the vaccine and getting the jab at private centres. Here, people are price conscious,” said a health department official, requesting anonymity. The Centre buys 75% of the vaccine produced to give free jabs to people, while 25% is allocated for the private sector. Earlier on Tuesday, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said in the Rajya Sabha that it was not necessary to reduce the vaccine quota of private hospitals as the unused quota of private hospitals was taken by the government. He was responding to BJP member Sushil Kumar Modi’s query on the government’s plan to reduce the vaccine quota of private hospitals. “In a month, we saw seven to nine per cent unused vaccines by private hospitals. So, we decided to take those unutilised doses in the government quota. Therefore, it is not necessary to reduce the quota for the private sector. The vaccination is taking place smoothly,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihars-smaller-pvt-health-firms-may-be-left-out-of-vaccine-supply-chain-101628093744063.html

The firm used credit facility for tax payment, but was found non-existent on the address mentioned in the documents, officials said.Commercial taxes commissioner cum secretary Pratima said that the firm was engaged in sending recharge vouchers worth crores to other states. “Appropriate action will be taken against the proprietors of the dubious firm along with other business installations, that indulged in tax evasion,” she said.The commercial taxes department officials on Wednesday carried out inspections at 33 business installations across the state to act against instances of tax evasion, based on comprehensive study of suspicious operations. Of the total, 13 are located in Patna district, 10 in Saran, one in Bhagalpur, three in Darbhanga, four in Magadh and two in Purnea. These firms were mainly related to iron and steel, coal, laptops, batteries, aluminium and copper scraps, bitumen etc.In the course of inspection, 24 firms were found non-existent at their principal place of business as mentioned in their registrations. Transactions of about ₹379.48 crore were shown by these firms, officials said. In such cases, not only the evasion of tax by availment of fake ITC of about ₹54.90 crore is involved, but also provisions of GST were violated. Some of these bogus firms have also taken registration on the basis of fake documents, officials said.During inspection, three firms were found existent at their declared principal place of business, but they were involved in bill trading. These three firms deal in coal and computers, said a senior officer.A computer firm in Darbhanga showed purchase and sale of laptops worth crores by showing fake transportation, with the benefit of ITC given to businessmen of other states. Goods’ transportation worth lakhs has been shown to be done by cars and bikes. Officials seized goods worth ₹30 lakh in this case. Out of these three firms, one firm registered in Aurangabad was found working in Dehri instead. Tax evasion of about ₹16 crore came to the fore in these three firms, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar33-firms-raided-over-suspect-tax-evasion-101628093685572.html

The PGI is thankful to the contact tracing team, CMO and other officials of district administration who were quick in reaching the PGI for tracing of contacts,” said Gaurav Agarwal, chief medical superintendent at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS). Agarwal said, “SGPGI is taking utmost care of its staff members. Ninety per cent of its staff has received both the shots. Because the Delta variant is lethal, the PGI administration didn’t want to take any risk and that’s why aggressive contact tracing was done and samples were collected by the district administration team.”The PGI nurse and her family had returned from Kerala by flight on July 30. She had a three-day-old Covid negative report with her. However, the nurse went for a Covid test after she, her husband and two kids developed fever, cold and cough. Their RTPCR report came positive, said officials.Deputy CMO Milind Wardhan said, “The contact tracing was performed immediately and samples of more than 122 contacts were taken and sent to the lab. The RTPCR report of all the contacts came negative. But second samples of these contacts would be sent for a test after a few days to ensure that no person is affected. Ideally, a second sample is taken after five days.”As many doctors and nurses of SGPGIMS go for vacations during summer vacations, the PGI administration has requested the returnees, especially from Delta affected states, to get themselves tested for Covid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sgpgi-nurse-kin-test-positive-samples-sent-for-genome-sequencing-101628093684991.html

The land belonged to the Vaishnavayat Ramanuja Section’s Bara Khatla Ashram in Vrindavan. A Shaivayat Section’s priest and his supporters allegedly attacked the manager and owner’s staff members, who were ploughing the land with a tractor on August 1.Two managers of the Vaishnavayat math were critically injured in the attack. Police registered a case for murder, arms act and SC/ST Act (as the victim belonged to the Scheduled Caste) against 12 named persons of Vaishnavayat Math and superintendent of police Ashish Bharti formed an SIT under Bikramganj SDPO for their arrest.The arrested persons have been identified as Raja Ram Singh and Shivji Singh of Karanj village, Sudhir Tiwary, Ravindra Tiwary and Surendra Tiwary of Paura, managers Daya Shankar Tiwary of Takanpura and Raja Ram Singh of Chhotki Agarer, all in Rohtas district.While five arrested persons were sent to jail, the remaining two critically injured managers were admitted to a government hospital at Dinara, police said.Meanwhile, Bara Khatla Vrindavan Peethadhishwar Swami Rameshwaracharya alleged that “the police were partial as they arrested innocent people, including critically injured managers, without investigating their involvement or location.”Rameshwaracharya said that the Patna high court passed a judgement in favour of math in 1969, but the dispute continued even after the judgement. In 2020, officials measured and demarcated the land on the order of the local circle officer.“Managers and the staff had gone to cultivate the land on the orders of the sub-divisional magistrate and the sub-divisional police officer given in Janta Durbar organised at a local police station on July 21,” he added.“They were attacked by Anoop Giri and his supporters who also torched the tractor. But police did not take any action against Giri and his men,” Rameshwaracharya alleged.However, Rohtas SP Ashish Bharti said that a case has also been registered against Annop Giri and his 11 men for the murderous attack, torching the tractor and theft. “Police will not spare any person involved in the incident,” Bharti said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-shot-dead-in-land-dispute-7-arrested-group-head-alleges-partial-action-by-police-101628093624064.html

Delta variant was also found in two cases from Hathras and one each from Mathura and Mainpuri, but there was no case with Delta Plus variant. “In all, 14 samples were sent by the Viral Diagnostic and Research Lab (VDRL), Microbiology Department of SN Medical College, Agra to KGMU Lucknow for genome sequencing on July 5. Out of these, Delta variant was found in 11 samples and Kappa variant was confirmed in one case,” informed Dr Prashant Gupta, the principal of SN Medical College. “Out of these 12 cases with Delta or Kappa variant, eight were from Agra, two from Hathras and one each from Mathura and Mainpuri,” said Dr Gupta who informed that Kappa variant was not so dangerous and both vaccines presently given in India were effective against it. “It is good that no case of Delta Plus variant has been traced in Agra or nearby region. Delta Plus is highly infectious and spreads faster and causes high rate of deaths,” he said. “There should be no laxity. One should wear a mask and follow physical distancing. More and more people should get vaccinated and social gatherings should be avoided,” said Dr Gupta. Earlier, on July 9, reports of 40 samples were sent from Agra for genome sequencing Out of these, Delta variant was traced in 16 samples. Out of these 16 samples, 10 were of those residing in Agra and 2 from Hathras, 2 from Firozabad, 1 from Mainpuri and 1 from Saharanpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-case-of-delta-plus-variant-traced-in-agra-region-101628093565889.html

The administration has also collected samples for genome sequencing to identify the lineage of the virus and to find how dangerous it could be for pregnant women. The central team, which met with concerned officials on Wednesday, will conduct a site inspection at Belasar village, Purandar taluka, on Thursday. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer who was part of the central team’s meeting with the district officials said, “We have sent samples of mosquitoes to identify if there are any infected mosquitoes. We will also be doing genome sequencing to identify the lineage. There are primarily two lineages, Asian and African, to find if pregnant women are more susceptible. As of now we are collecting samples of pregnant women in the village and from nearby villages for testing. The probable causes of the spread of the virus could be the underground tanks which could be breeding ground for the Aedes mosquito, which is the primary vector of the virus and also other viruses.”He also added that the probable source of infection could be traders who come to the villages with agriculture fields mainly producing tomatoes and pomegranates. Awate said, “Traders from across the country including Kerala have been visiting the villages for trading purposes and it could be that one of the infected persons could have carried the infection to the village. About 80% of those infected with Zika virus remain asymptomatic and so it would be difficult to know if an infected person had indeed travelled. However, this is just a possibility. We do not know for sure what is the source of infection in this case.” Kerala has been reporting a high number of Zika virus cases and as of July 21, the state reported 41 confirmed cases. The NIV team which visited the Belaras village, and of the five initial samples sent, three tested positive for chikungunya. Once the outbreak was reported on July 14, a NIV team under leadership of Dr Yogesh Gurav, team leader of Arbovirus division, visited the village On July 27. The NIV team visited Belsar, Shivri, Malshiras and Supe (Khurd) villages. The team visited the residential and non-residential areas and checked vector breeding in the water holding containers. NIV Team collected 51 blood samples of suspected Chikungunya cases during their visit, of which one sample tested positive for Zika. The Zika positive sample was also positive for Chikungunya Real time PCR and Chikungunya IgM ELISA. The first positive case of Zika virus was reported in the village, which was a 50-year old lady. She tested positive for both Zika and Chikungunya. She has symptoms like fever, joint pain, headache, eye pain and petechial haemorrhages. She has no travel history. Her daughter, a 25-year old, tested positive for Chikungunya. In its report to the central team the district administration pointed out that one of the probable reasons is increased Aedes larval density. The report states Belsar village has water supply through a water supply scheme, but as the water supply scheme is too old due to some technical glitch villagers get tap water supply once in three days. This forces villagers to store water for domestic purposes. These water containers are coverless. Many households have underground tanks for water storage. These tanks are also devoid of any cover.As of August 4, of the 152 samples sent to NIV, five tested positive for dengue, 63 for chikungunya, 15 for dengue and Chikungunya and one for Zika and Chikungunya, while 41 have tested negative for any of the infections and 27 reports are yet to be declared. Some of the ongoing measures in Belasar and the neighbouring villages are house-to-house surveillance, which includes identification of cases within a five-km radius of the ground zero village, Belsar. In addition, a village cleanliness drive, capacity building of village volunteers for proactive entomological surveillance, normalisation of village water supply and health education about Zika and the necessity to use appropriate contraceptives for eligible couples is underway. Also entomological surveillance is underway, in which a house-to-house team does a daily assessment of the Aedes larval density through different indices.In view of the high risk that the virus poses to the pregnant women, samples of all pregnant women are being sent to the NIV for testing, along with the high risk relatives of these pregnant women. Bed nets and creams have been provided to all the pregnant women for protection. Pune city has over 33 thousand pregnant women, PMC cautions them to get tested in case of any symptoms In the past four months, April to July, PMC has recorded 33,000thousand pregnant women who are in different trimesters, said a PMC official. As the first Zika virus cases are reported in Pune district, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has cautioned those with any symptoms, especially those who have travelled to any infected places to get tested. Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant health officer at PMC said, “The ongoing action like surveillance and fogging and destruction of Aedes mosquitoes larvae will be continued. However, if anyone who has symptoms of Zika virus which are mainly fever, rash, headache, joint pain, conjunctivitis (red eyes) and muscle pain, then they must get themselves tested at any private lab or even a PMC hospital”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/samples-of-mosquitoes-collected-to-detect-zika-virus-genome-sequencing-underway-to-identify-lineage-101628093563948.html

Earlier, these students had got admission through online process amid the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the university administration failed to detect that none of them had studied Maithili subject at the graduation level, either as main or subsidiary paper.LNMU’s admission committee has also served a show cause notice to head of department (HoD) Maithili.However, incumbent HoD Prof Ramesh Jha, when contacted, said he had assumed charge of the department only recently, much after admissions were done. He, however, confirmed receipt of a show cause letter in this regard.According to dean students welfare (DSW) Vijay Kumar Yadav, the university administration has constituted a committee to probe into the episode and fixed responsibility for the lapses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lnmu-cancels-admission-of-24-engg-grads-in-pg-maithili-course-101628093504093.html

Following the incident in Lodipur village under Chhabilapur police station limits, a large police contingent has been deployed in the area to prevent any escalation. No arrested has been made yet in the case.According to police, there was a dispute over 25 bighas (a local land measurement unit) of land in the village between two related families, which are already in court for title suit settlement. In April this year, the two sides has even signed a pledge at the police station to maintain peace.According to police, the incident occurred when members of one family on Wednesday went to plough the land. “Heated arguments between the two families led to a fight. The situation took an ugly turn when gunshots were fired,” said Sanjay Singh, inspector general of police (central range). In the ensuing violence, four people were shot dead on the spot while two others succumbed to their injuries on way to the hospital, the IG said. Nalanda superintendent of police (SP) Hari Prasath, citing preliminary investigation, said the group that reached the field first opened fire and the other party did not retaliate. He said separate teams had been formed to apprehend the accused. Residents of the village refused to allow police the take away the bodies for autopsy till the accused are arrested. Meanwhile, Leader of Opposition Tejashvi Yadav said the Nitish Kumar government had surrendered before the land mafia and demanded a compensation of ₹20 lakh for the kin of the deceased. The chief minister’s office said Kumar has directed the state police chief to personally monitor the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/six-of-family-shot-dead-over-land-dispute-in-nalanda-101628093445221.html

The final nod was given by chief minister Nitish Kumar during a presentation by road construction department.Additional chief secretary (roads) Amrit Lal Meena said that Mokama to Munger road is a greenfield project, which will pass through Manoharpur and Lakhisarai. The project also includes 20-km four-lane between Manoharpur and Sarmera, which would ensure a seamless journey for travellers from Buxar to Mirjachowki (Bhagalpur) via Patna, Mokama and Munger.The state government also gave its approval for the widening of the existing two-lane road between Barauni and Muzaffarpur via Bachhwara, Dalsingh Sarai and Musri Gharari. The NHAI proposal to build a 17-km four-lane road between Buxar and Haidaria has also been approved by the chief minister. Once complete, Buxar would be connected with Purvanchal Expressway, being built by the NHAI from Lucknow and Haidaria in Uttar Pradesh.The long-awaited demand of the state government to connect Buxar with Varanasi through a four-lane road on its way for realisation after the NHAI proposed a fresh alignment of the 71-km road. Of the total alignment, 29-km stretch falls under Bihar’s territory with the rest in Uttar Pradesh.Officials said that all four projects might cost more than ₹10,000 crore to the NHAI. The state government would acquire land on behalf of the NHAI, and hence it would not require spending anything on the project.The RCD has urged the Central government to include 552-km long Indo-Nepal border road under the Bharat Mala project-II and strengthen it into four-lane roads. Currently, the road, which is of strategic importance, has two lanes. Other roads, which the state government recommended for their integration with Bharat Mala project-II, are Patna-Kolkata Expressway, Buxar-Bihar Sharif state highway via Piro, Arwal and Jehanabad, Sultanganj- Deoghar and Dalsingh Sarai-Simri Bakhtiarpur road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-govt-clears-four-new-nhai-road-projects-101628093444030.html
04-08-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks non-SSC boards to respond to state proposal for FYJC’s common entrance test||The state government on Wednesday informed the Bombay high court (HC) that the planned common entrance test (CET) for first-year junior college (FYJC) admissions will have seven papers of 25 marks each and students will have to opt for four papers. The questions will be based on a mixed syllabus — from the SSC board as well as other boards — and the questions will be provided by the respective boards. The HC has now asked other boards to respond to the proposal by Friday.The state government also informed HC that around 1 million SSC students and 5,000 students from other boards have registered for the CET. The government also informed the bench that as per the directions of the HC, a meeting with officials of CBSE, ISCE and other boards was held through video conferencing, wherein the CET format was discussed. The state submitted that the CBSE board said it had no problem with the format of CET, provided other boards agreed as well. The division bench of justice RD Dhanuka and justice RI Chagla was hearing the petition filed by ICSE student Ananya Patki, seeking setting aside of the May 28 notification issued by the state government regarding the conduction of CET exam for admission to class 11. Advocate Yogesh Patki had argued that as the CET would be based on the SSC syllabus and would be held through the physical mode it would prejudice students from other boards and his daughter as well as she could not appear for the test physically. The state through government pleader Poornima Kantharia had informed the court that the test was only for those students who wanted admission in top junior colleges and priority would be given to students who took the CET. She had submitted that registration for the August 21 test was started on July 21 and had been extended by three days on July 26. The court had asked the state whether it could have separate papers for students based on the syllabus of their respective boards else withdraw the priority in admission status to students who took the CET. The court had then asked the state to discuss the issue with other boards and inform it on August 4. On Wednesday, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni informed the court that a meeting of different board officials was held and all of them had agreed that they could not interfere in the decisions of the state. Kumbhakoni submitted that the boards were asked to provide a bank of 200 questions to the state, which would be included with the state board syllabus questions after modification to avoid leakage of questions. Kumbhakoni submitted that the papers would be based on Social Science, Mathematics, English and Science syllabus and other three groups would be decided after the other boards submitted their question banks. He said that students would have the option to choose any four groups to attempt from the group of seven. Kumbhakoni urged the court not to stay the August 21 test as any delay would have a cascading effect on admissions and eventually on the commencement of the academic year. While Patki submitted that he wanted to argue on merits of the test, the court directed the other boards with the exception of CBSE board, which were not present, to submit their say by Thursday evening and be present for the hearing on Friday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-asks-non-ssc-boards-to-respond-to-state-proposal-for-fyjc-s-common-entrance-test-101628093205428.html

04-08-2021||Mumbai||Uddhav: Delay in detecting Delta variant led to second Covid-19 wave||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday said the state government was late in detecting the Delta variant, which led to the devastating second Covid-19 wave. To avoid any such situation in future, a laboratory for genome sequencing has been set up in Mumbai in a very short time, he said. He was speaking at the virtual inauguration of the laboratory set up at Nair Hospital. The hospital is expected to begin conducting tests to identify variants of Sars-Cov-2 from next week, making it the first civic hospital to conduct genome sequencing in Mumbai. The high-speed machine can run tests on 380 samples per round.The civic body will incur a cost of ₹10,000 for testing one sample.“When the first wave of Covid-19 was about to end, a slight rise in daily cases was reported in Amravati. Health experts were of the view that it would come under control, which did not happen. Soon the entire country and the world was again found infected with the virus and later we came to know about the new variant called — Delta. We also came to know about its virulence and transmissibility and body parts it affects the most, a little late. We would have been cautious if we had come to know all this at an early stage,” Thackeray said. Maharashtra is one of the most affected states in second wave of Covid-19 epidemic. “To fight a battle, one is expected to know everything about its enemy such as its strength, among others. Similarly, identifying the type of variant or mutation and their treatment has become absolutely necessary. There was a view that something has to be done as we don’t want to face such a situation again and this genome-sequencing laboratory was set up and that too in a very less time, without putting financial burden on the state government and BMC,” he added.In April, the state government signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) to sequence 100 Covid-19 positive samples each from 36 districts per month. The CSIR-IGIB report in the third week of June found Delta Plus variants in the state.Genome sequencing is an exercise to study the changes in the structure of the virus over time. A combination of changes in the ribonucleic acid of the virus can give birth to a new variant. Currently, it takes over two-three months to get test results of genome sequencing which delays the epidemiological study of the mutated virus in infected patients. With the starting of the laboratory, the results of 380 samples will be available within three-four days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/uddhav-delay-in-detecting-delta-variant-led-to-second-covid-19-wave-101628092787327.html

In June, 62,000 passengers were fined, and ₹2.6 crore was recovered from them.“We urge only the passengers who are permitted by the state government to travel by local trains. We have noticed an increase in passengers that have been travelling with fake identity cards, transfer of tickets and altered tickets. We appeal to the passengers to travel with proper and valid railway tickets to avoid inconvenience,” said a senior Central Railway official.Local train services are currently operational for employees working in essential care and people who are travelling for medical purposes. “Passengers as identified by state government are only permitted to travel in suburban local trains currently. A decision on allowing passengers and checking for vaccinated passengers will be done alongside the Maharashtra government,” said a senior railway official who did not wish to be named.Urban planner Sulakshana Mahajan, said, “The doctors and the government agencies will be able to analyse the risks and the benefits and then decide on allowing general public in local trains. The government agencies will also have to work to control the crowd inside train compartments.” Between April and July, this year, 304,000 passengers travelling without tickets were fined by the Central Railway and ₹15.9 crore was recovered as a fine. The local train services were suspended for the general public for the second time on April 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-cr-fines-90-000-commuters-for-travelling-without-tickets-101628092544258.html
04-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Why indoor dining carries a high risk of Covid-19 spread?||As Mumbai unlocks further, citizens were hopeful for more relaxation in the timings of restaurants. But the city’s administration has refrained from extending the dine-in hours. Reason: Indoor dining, mainly in air-conditioned, closed spaces is considered high risk for the transmission of Covid-19. “Restaurants are the only places where unmasking is involved. This is perhaps why the restrictions on restaurants continue in the city,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the Covid-19 task force of Maharashtra. Currently, restaurants are allowed to remain open for dine-in services only up to 4pm on weekdays. After the first lockdown, restaurants implemented many innovative ways for a limited-contact experience for their customers. Digital food menus, staggered seating, reduced occupancy were some of the measures that were introduced. But a crucial aspect could not be changed — the air conditioners. “In an air-conditioned space, the same air keeps circulating in the enclosed space,” said Rajneesh Bhardwaj, associate professor, department of mechanical engineering at Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B). “The concentration of particles in this air is higher, which makes it risky, he said. According to Bhardwaj, closed, air-conditioned eating spaces carry a high risk of infection spread. “The risk may go down slightly in non-air-conditioned, well-ventilated spaces and it further reduces in open air space. We should not forget that there will always be a heightened risk when one does not wear a mask and the virus continues to be in circulation,” he said. A 2020 research paper published in the Journal of Korean Medical Science that studied a restaurant setting said that droplet transmission can occur at a distance greater than 2 metres (6 feet) if there is direct airflow from an infected person in an indoor setting. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stated that being outdoors and in spaces with good ventilation reduces the risk of exposure to the virus. It also suggests increasing the circulation of outdoor air as much as possible, for example, by opening windows and doors and prioritising outdoor seating. Medical experts say the best time to introduce relaxations for restaurants is when the city achieves nearly 70% full vaccination coverage. As more people get vaccinated, it will create safer environments for eateries and restaurants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-why-indoor-dining-carries-a-high-risk-of-covid-19-spread-101628092244568.html

The trio was wanted in the case and carried a reward of ₹25,000 each on their head, Barabanki cops stated in their tweet. Ansari is currently lodged in Banda jail since April 9, after being brought back to UP jail on Supreme Court’s order.The three accused were private security guards and driver of the ambulance. They always remained present in the ambulance whenever Ansari travelled in it, stated an official. He said they confessed their involvement in the crime and stated that they left the ambulance abandoned at a roadside eatery in Ropad when the media highlighted the issue on April 1. So far, the Barabanki police had arrested 10 people in this connection while two more accused, Zafar alias Chanda and Afroz Khan alias Chunnu, were still at large. Those arrested earlier included Dr Alka Rai, her brother Sheshnath Rai, Rajnath Yadav, Anand Yadav, Mohammed Shoaib Mujahid, Saleem and Ali Mohammed Jafari alias Shahid.The ambulance was registered with a fake address of Barabanki in the name of Dr Alka Rai’s hospital in Mau since December 2013 and was being used by Ansari for his transportation from jails. The Barabanki police had registered an FIR against Dr Rai and others on April 1, after the registration of the ambulance was found fake.The FIR was lodged on the complaint of Barabanki assistant road transport officer (ARTO) Pankaj Singh. On April 3, the police constituted a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/three-aides-of-mukhtar-ansari-held-in-ambulance-case-101628089844064.html

The decision regarding the exemption from vaccination (due to medical conditions only) has to be taken by the college head.The order, which includes the guidelines as well, was issued after the UT administration in July allowed colleges and universities to reopen from August, with the rider that students, teaching and non-teaching staff who turn up for physical classes must have received at least one vaccine dose. There are nine government colleges and seven grant-in-aid colleges under the purview of the department of higher education in Chandigarh.According to the instructions issued, the heads of the institutions have been asked to work out all modalities for the phasing of classes so that Covid-appropriate behaviour can be followed.For more than a year, since March last year when the pandemic first broke out, city colleges have remained largely shut. Some colleges reopened in November, but didn’t evoke much response from students. When the first wave subsided, the administration had decided to reopen all colleges in February this year. However, the second wave started soon after in March, thwarting the plan.The heads of colleges have also been asked to ensure that teaching and non-teaching staff have received at least one dose of vaccination. Every college has been directed to work out its plan for the opening of hostels and students seeking hostel accommodation will be required to submit a negative RT-PCR report.Moreover, the institutions have been asked to ensure that Covid-appropriate behaviour is followed, as prescribed by the Government of India and Chandigarh administration. According to the academic calendar for 2021-22 issued by Panjab University (PU), the classes for ongoing batches at its affiliated colleges, including the ones in Chandigarh, will begin n August 11.PU yet to decide Despite the next academic session for the ongoing batches set to begin on August 11, Panjab University is yet to decide on reopening the campus.The varsity has not even announced the mode of teaching to be adopted, leaving students in a fix. The varsity has remained closed since March last year after the Covid-19 outbreak. The classes and exams for both semesters of the 2020-21 academic session were conducted online.While demanding resumption of physical classes, students of a few departments had boycotted online classes this March. According to sources, PU might decide to take classes online for some time as it is unprepared to reopen the campus for students as yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-colleges-to-reopen-from-august-11-101628088404449.html

Experts say that the number of cases may continue to remain low for a few weeks, after which they will rise again as restrictions have been eased and people are not taking precautions.According to official data, the union territory recorded 5,800 infections and 55 deaths of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in July. In June, the union territory had recorded 25,197 cases and 416 deaths.There has been a consistent decrease in test positivity rate (TPR) in July – 0.46% for July 1-10, 0.28% for July 11-20 and 0.23% for July 21-31. The number of daily cases had reduced to under 100 after July 20 to 63 on July 23 during the second wave.Also Read | ‘Covid recovered people with Covishield jabs safer against Delta variant’: StudyTPR is the percentage of tests that turn out to be positive, out of the total tests conducted during the period. It helps indicate the extent of infection in the community.The overall TPR in the month of July dropped to 0.32%, while it had been 1.80% in June.However, the past 10 days have witnessed a slight increase in cases. The TPR from July 25 to August 3 has slightly increased to 0.24%. The daily cases for the past 10 days are fluctuating between 100 and 160.Experts are saying that the situation may remain like this for two to three weeks after which the cases are expected to rise again as the restrictions have been eased.“We are at the same position we were in February when the first wave had ebbed. The daily cases will hover around 100, sometimes 20 up and sometimes 20 down, and this will change after two-three weeks when the cases will again rise,” said Dr Owais H Dar, general secretary of Doctors’ Association of Kashmir.“As restrictions have been eased and everything is open, people are hardly wearing masks. The virus variants are also evolving. These things will obviously add up and the third wave will emerge,” he said.In May, when the second Covid-19 wave peaked, the TPR was 8.77% with the union territory recording 114,000 cases and 1,625 deaths.There has been a consistent increase in the average monthly number of tests in the past three months. The union territory conducted 1.758 million tests in July – over 25% more than June, when 1.393 million tests were conducted. On an average, 56,700 people were tested daily in July and 46,400 in June.Dr Owais said that he is hopeful that the third wave won’t be as severe as the second.“We have a positive thing this time which is vaccination.

04-08-2021||Lucknow||CISH develops mango varieties rich in medicinal properties||The Central Institute for Subtropical Horticulture, (CISH) Lucknow has developed healthier varieties of mangoes with bio-active compounds, senior scientists with CISH said.They said these varieties of mangoes would be high in medicinal benefits and would have anti-cancerous properties.“Indeed, it’s a big discovery which will be a major value addition to the most-favourite fruit. Of the many hybrid varieties of mango, the researchers found CISH-developed “Arunika” rich in the bio-active compounds including mangiferin and lupeol content,” said Shailendra Rajan, director CISH.“The red-blushed Arunika is of great medicinal properties. The bio-active compounds present in this variety lower blood glucose levels by preventing glucose absorption in the intestine, whereas the Mangiferin helps to protect against breast and colon cancer,” the CISH director said.Another variety of medicinal mango, developed by CISH is “Saheb Pasand”, which the director said was the sweetest variety of mango that was high in lupeol content (The compound that is known for a wide range of pharmacological activities against a variety of disease conditions). Inflammation, arthritis, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, hepatic toxicity, microbial infections and cancer are some of such disease conditions.He said the institute was ready with the variety however the test of the pulp was still on in order to compare these hybrid mangoes with other available varieties of mango in terms of medicinal content. He said in near future, cultivation of these special varieties of mango would yield better income to the farmers and also health benefits to the consumers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cish-develops-mango-varieties-rich-in-medicinal-properties-101628084024044.html

The promotional camp was set up at Lal Mandir area where BJP workers allegedly created ruckus and also warned AAP workers against entering the colony. A complaint has been filed by AAP state vice-president women wing Hema Bhandari against a dozen-odd BJP activists at Jwalapur police station. AAP workers tried to gherao BJP state president Madan Kaushik. They had heated arguments with police when stopped at the entrance of Khanna Nagar Colony. AAP worked staged a sit-in after which some BJP workers also arrived at the spot but police defused the situation.Also Read | Known for Chipko, Raini village now unfit to live in“BJP has stooped to low-grade politics.

Refuting allegations of violence by his party workers, BJP district president Jaypal Singh Chauhan said AAP creates such instances and blows them out of proportion to gain media mileage. “As far as AAP claiming to be a major force in state politics is concerned, they are daydreaming. BJP will win 60 plus seats and our party is going to make a clean sweep in 2022 assembly elections,” he said. The Congress, while condemning the incident, said both the parties are hand in glove. “Congress resorts to silent, non-violent protests only.

These include two lawyers. City trial court judge I S Alli also sentenced two others to life imprisonment and one accused who turned approver was released without punishment. On September 14, 2013, the 58-year-old doctor was killed in full public view while he was walking out of Chennai’s Billroth Hospital towards his parked car after work in the evening. A land dispute with his family over a 2.4-acre plot in the doctor’s native Anjugramam village in Tamil Nadu’s Kanyakumari district led to the crime. Three people wielding machetes attacked the doctor on his head, neck and he suffered more than 20 cuts across his body. Many people witnessed the attack and CCTV from a nearby apartment also captured it. Dr Subbiah succumbed to his injuries nine days later.

The other two accused, Mary Pushpam and Yesurajan, have been sentenced to double life terms. One of the convicts, William, is an advocate whose bail petition was rejected by the Supreme Court in May 2018. Prosecutor Vijayaraj had at that time submitted a petition in court to declare Williams as proclaimed offender as he had been absconding with his family members. Williams surrendered in August that year and was remanded to judicial custody. Another accused, P Iyyapan, who turned approver in 2018 and became a prosecution witness during the trial, was allowed to walk free without any punishment. Iyyapan had confessed that he, along with Murugan and Selvaprakash, had killed the doctor. After the sentencing, the murdered doctor’s wife, Shanthi Subbiah, flanked by her daughters said, “This is an emotional and private moment for us...In those nine days, he was semi-conscious, I’m sure he would have only thought about me and his two daughters. We are not going to get him back, but today’s verdict is some consolation. My husband believed in the judiciary and so did we. Today’s verdict shows that our trust in the judiciary hasn’t gone in vain.

Some others from the community have called the internal communication, a “charge sheet” against them.“The National Commission for Minorities has issued a notice to the Chief Secretary of Uttar Pradesh and called for a clarification on the controversial aspects of the guidelines issued by the DGP of Uttar Pradesh regarding the month of Muharram,” NCM vice president Atif Rashid said, according to news agency PTI.The NCM letter asked the state government to clarify where and on how many incidents of intra-community violence were reported. Besides, the letter also sought an explanation on “how a confidential letter came out in the public domain.”The controversial guidelines on the arrangements to be made during Moharram, starting on August 10, was issued on July 31.Maulana Yasoob Abbas, senior Shia cleric and general secretary of AISMPLB, said they were grateful to the NCM for taking suo motu cognisance “of the guidelines that are politically driven and aimed at creating differences between the two sects”.“In the guidelines, the DGP office blamed Shia Muslims for carrying out certain religious practices which hurts the religious sentiments of the people belonging to the other sect. Besides, they referred to Moharram as a festival, which is absolutely wrong since it’s a time to mourn and not to celebrate. Also, the guidelines ban the tazia processions that are carried out during Moharram to mark the martyrdom of Imam Husain, Prophet Mohammad’s grandson and his 72 companions in Karbala (in present-day Iraq) in 680 AD,” the senior cleric said.He also requested the state government to allow them to take out tazia processions while following the Covid-19 protocol.After the controversy, the UP Police said the circular was meant only for its officials, not for the general public. The order on the dos and don’ts issued on July 31 was meant for the officers in the field and not for the public, additional director general of police (law and order) Prashant Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ncm-seeks-clarification-on-up-dgp-s-moharram-guidelines-101628082042667.html

The forces have maintained that the deceased, Bheema Kunjam, was a Maoist platoon commander who died in an exchange of fire.The protest is on in the Maoist-affected Chintagufa village which is around 450 kilometres from Raipur. Sukma police said Kunjam was killed in a gunfight in Paddigua village, which comes under Chitagufa police station. They said personnel of District Reserve Guard (DRG) and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were involved in the operation following a tip-off. The exchange of fire went on for well over an hour and the remaining Maoists escaped while Kunjam’s body was recovered from the spot. However, the villagers say Kunjam was picked up from his village on July 24 before being killed the next morning. “He was not a Maoist, he was just a farmer living with his wife in his village...Police claimed that a country-made gun was recovered from the spot, but Kunjam had no gun. Anyone who carries a gun, lives in the jungle, not in the village with his wife... We want action against those who killed him,” said Ravi Sodhi, one of the protesters.Also Read | Cop, civilian injured in J&K terror attack: PoliceAnother villager, Ganesh , said they all were raising their voices as police are targeting villagers instead of Maoists and if they will not raise voice against this violence now, they all will suffer. Sukma superintendent of police Sunil Sharma maintained that Kunjam even had a reward of ₹1 lakh on his head and six cases were registered against him. “The villagers have been coerced by Maoists to protest against us. Mangadu, an area commander of CPI ( Maoist), threatened them to join the protest,” he said. “The allegations are baseless and part of the modus operandi of Maoists to defame the forces. In the recent past, Maoists have suffered major setbacks. In a desperate attempt to avoid their extinction from Bastar region, their leadership is resorting to such false propaganda,” said Inspector General of Police , (Bastar range ) Sunderaj P. Human right activists working in Bastar believe that instances of fake “encounter” have increased in the past six months and security forces are killing soft targets. “Typically, the DRG is involved and those killed are soft targets. Recent incidents across districts follow a similar pattern, making one conclude that what is happening is a part of policy,” said Bela Bhatia , a Bastar-based human rights activist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cgarh-villagers-sit-in-protest-over-man-s-death-forces-say-he-was-a-maoist-101628080423125.html
04-08-2021||Chandigarh||Of jaunty joints, hostel life with a dollop of nostalgia||Hostel life is synonymous with messy rooms, dirty laundry piled up in a corner, midnight pranks, complaints about mess food, sneaking in and out during curfew hours, sharing of desi ghee pinnis and ladoos, lifelong friendships and a lifetime of memories. One such shared memory among hostellers invariably includes visits to a nearby dhaba or an eating joint in the vicinity of the campus that doles out simple yet sumptuous dishes at any hour, particularly when the mess food is unpalatable. Being a day scholar throughout my school and college days, I have no such memories. However, on numerous occasions when I drove to pick or drop my daughter at National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra, my observant eye never failed to notice the multi-coloured, jaunty joints and kiosks sprouting alongside the boundary wall of the campus, extending almost up to the college gate. A motley crowd, ranging from the shy and apprehensive freshers to final year abrasive seniors to philosophical research scholars, have been witnessed paying their obeisance at these epicurean shrines that satiate the gastronomic pangs arising at odd hours. A closer look at these food stalls offers you a glimpse of the menu being served which may be limited as compared to a high-end restaurant yet guarantees a quicker delivery and a richer taste. Most of these kiosks serve eggs in myriad forms. You can order a humble plain or cheese omelette in a bun or with a toast, a par boiled egg hard to resist or a wobbly soft boiled one, the all-time favourite anda bhurji or scrambled eggs with lots of onions and coriander or a highly irresistible and innovative variety, the anda parantha. Instant noodles with several derivatives of the same are also a hit among the hostellers. You can enhance these dishes either with squirts of ketchup or spoonful of homemade chutneys that are served at no extra cost. The palate-tingling, spicy dishes are often washed down with fizzy drinks in summer and hot scalding tea in winter. These dhabas, kiosks, stalls or joints, call them what you may, present a microcosm of the varied culture of a country as diverse as India. Social class, colour, creed, religion or political leanings play no role once you step inside, for everyone is served with equal gusto and reverence. Many years down the line, when old friends sit and reminisce of the college days or hostel life, the rejoinder of these joints unfailingly brings a smile upon their faces. My husband often recalls one such joint called Jhanku ka Dhaba from his hostel days with great fondness, that used to be a favourite place for paranthas during their late-night soirees. Unfortunately, with educational institutions facing temporary closure due to the pandemic and hostels lying vacant, these jaunty joints no longer bear a cheerful visage and are facing tough times. If this piece reminds you of your hostel days and rings a bell about one such joint that you used to frequent along with your friends, please spare a kind thought to that poor dhaba owner who used to satiate your hunger pangs at odd hours and within your means. sonrok15@gmail.com The writer is an Ambala-based college teacher||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/of-jaunty-joints-hostel-life-with-a-dollop-of-nostalgia-101628079642112.html

Her autobiography was translated into English by Uma Vasudev as ‘A Drop in the Ocean’.Padma, along with other writers and activists, pressed hard for the recognition of the Dogri language. “When Atal Bihari Vajpayee became PM, I would nag him about it as I knew him as a fellow poet. So he would avoid me knowing what I was going to ask for!” she would recount. When official recognition came to Dogri in December 2003, Padma says it was the happiest day for her as the language had its own identity and was not just taken for a dialect.”Behind her tinkling laughter was a life of struggle and resilience as she fought many setbacks and persistent health problems.

04-08-2021||Pune||Maha’s districts of concern including Pune report lower Covid vaccination rate even as cases surge||As districts of concern including Pune continue to be under stricter restrictions, these have also seen a smaller percentage of people getting the Covid-19 vaccine as compared to the major cities like Mumbai or the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) which has received a larger share of the vaccine and is currently under lenient restrictions compared to the rest of the state.These districts of concern include Pune, Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli, Solapur, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Ahmednagar, Beed, Raigad and Palghar.The task force has recommended that at least 70 per cent of the total population has to be fully vaccinated and only then the restrictions can be eased.As per data from the CoWIN app, none of the 11 districts of concern has vaccinated more than 30 per cent of its population with the first dose and more than 16 per cent of its population with the second dose. However, Mumbai and the MMR region which includes Thane has vaccinated about 40 per cent of its population with the first dose and 13.06 per cent of its population with the second dose.Despite being a major city even Pune has been facing a shortage of vaccines. “There is no supply of Covidshield vaccine in Pune since last four days. We are facing problems due to the non-supply of doses. For the last four days, we are only giving Covaxin to beneficiaries,” said Pune Mayor Murlidhar Mohol, on Tuesday.The Beed district, which is now emerging as a new district of concern since July has the lowest number of people being vaccinated among these 11 districts of concern, six per cent or 169,685 people are fully vaccinated.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, Covid-19 advisor to the state government, said, “My recommendation to the government of India was not to consider the distribution of vaccines equally based on population, which is absurd epidemiologically. As an authority, they will have to give a slightly more weightage and supply more vaccine doses to the districts reporting more cases.”“Currently for districts like Solapur, Kolhapur and Sangli I would recommend more vaccines than the districts which have a lower positivity now. The current strategy of vaccine distribution is not a sound one and better strategies have helped despite the shortage of doses which will always be there,” he said.He further added, “We have to understand that the Covid-19 situation currently be it in Maharashtra or Kerala will be better than what it was before provided that the intensity of the vaccination drive is maintained stable or that it is increased and that the Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is followed.”“As of now Vidarbha region is reporting single-digit cases and so the intensity of the surveillance has to be more aggressive there otherwise if they fail now there could be an outbreak and then it will be difficult for the administration and the health infrastructure to handle the surge later,” he said.Dr Shashank Joshi, another member of the Covid-19 task force, said, “We had opened up almost everything following the first wave, somewhere in mid-January, the surge in the second wave was primarily because of the delta variant which is now thought to be as widely infectious as chickenpox. As a health expert, to maintain the balance between health and economy it is necessary to monitor and restrict as it helps the health infrastructure to prepare.”“As of now we have no lockdown as such, we have restrictions in place. We need to look to prevent micro containment zones and prevent surges, the virus circulation needs to be intervened through restrictions and the vaccination is also not at par,” he said.“The operational factors between first and second waves are different as the Delta variant was not involved in the first wave. In the first wave, the R nought was about 3.5 which in the second wave went up to 8-11 of the Delta variant which makes it as fast as chickenpox which is why the relaxations are slower. Plus with the monsoon coming up many Covid and non-Covid flu-like symptoms may get mixed and so we need to avoid a monsoon pandemic,” he said.Dr Joshi also added that the Delta plus variant has nothing to do with this spread. He said, “Although some of these districts did report cases with Delta plus variants, it has nothing to do with the surge.”As of August 2, except Sindhudurg, other districts have reported a fall in the number of active cases below the most active Covid-19 cases reported in the first wave. The highest number of active patients in the first wave was 1,346 which as of 2nd August is 1888 which is 40.27% more than the peak of the first wave in Sindhudurg district, said the state health report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mahas-districts-of-concern-including-pune-report-lower-covid-vaccination-rate-even-as-cases-surge-101628074841539.html
04-08-2021||Pune||Sutradhara’s Tales: The rustic divinity of Pune’s deities of the hills||The modern Pune of the 21st century still harbours a cosmic world of magical spirits, goblins and folk deities of primitive origins in its folds. Before we explore the blast of development which took place during the 18th century and track the process of Pune’s urbanisation, let us take stock of lesser-known folk cults residing in and around the prominent hills of Pune.Habitation and human connection with the hills of Pune has not been a new phenomenon, starting from micro-lithic tools of Mesolithic man to historical cave excavation activities in early medieval period. For lack of evidence, we cannot find a point in history when the folk deities come into existence. Establishment of a folk deity is, often, part of larger cultural processes of assimilation, mobilisation, elevation, demobilisation, replication, and adaption within social movements and religious discourses. It may, at times, be a manifestation of an un-manifested power perceived by a group or a community, or interpretation of a natural phenomenon. The cycles of evolution and regression repeat in cultural processes based on the local perception of the masses. Divine marriages, acquisition of a family or entourage, and successive incarnations are theological manifestations of social fusion. The continuity of certain cult-spots does not mean that descendants of the original prehistoric tribesmen continued to worship the same god at the same place with, at most, a change of name. Ceaseless nomadic movements, famines, migrations, feudal warfare and epidemics can confuse any regular sequence. Nevertheless, some continuity of tradition often remains and restoration of cults in modified forms can be observed. The relevance of the folk deity is upheld through divine interactions with the deity through means of rituals such as a “angat yene” (possession by the divine spirit), Shamanic functions via devrushi, offering of prasada, pledging and fulfilling the vows, kaul (demanding solution to problems through series of questions and answers), various demonstrations through performances and plays, and hosting a yatra (pilgrimage) or jatra (fairs). The tradition of bagad held at the Nava Kalbhairav Temple is one such example. The nomadic and semi-nomadic pastoralists such as Dhangars have been frequenting Pune environs for centuries as they set off on annual migrations to western parts of Maharashtra and Konkan. The lush grass pastures on hills have served as annual pit stops on the way. The centuries of connection to the place along annual migration has resulted in veneration of spirits by enshrining of the spots. This is very well observed at the top of the Vetal hill complex, right in the centre of Pune city. The place marks the boundary of four villages, namely, Pashan, Kothrud, Erandwane and Bhamburda, all of which are firmly a part of the Pune metropolis, today. Till a few decades back, there existed a stone circle erected by the Dhangars painted in white which represents the king of goblins, Vetal, along with his hordes. The king of goblins was later assimilated in the Shaiva pantheon, but here it exists as an independent deity. The younger brother of elder Vetal is located at foothill near the Mendhi farm area. The malevolent spirit of Vetal is known to be fierce as seen through adjective such as “agya” (fiery) and is offered non- vegetarian prasada. The annual jatra takes place on Gudhi Padwa when locals of Ramoshi wadi carry out a procession in the middle of night to enact Vetalbaba’s midnight march consisting of pishacchas, bhutas and goblins. Wrestlers from all around Pune are known to offer their prayers and pledge vows asking for strength and virility before wrestling matches. The shrine is considered an embodiment of the hill environs itself. The deity and its pantheon, thus, prefer to stay in the open, sky clad. One witnesses vermilion- clad erect undressed stones all around the shrine representing blood-thirsty spirits attending Vetalbaba. Women are not preferred around the shrine. However, these restrictions have been relaxed now days. Though the nature of rites has grown less primitive and fierce today, the fear-filled respect for the deity of Vetal is still realised. Curiously, there existed a ward of Pune known as Vetal peth, named after Vetal baba who hailed from Saswad region. The other famous Goddess of a Pune hill is goddess Chaturshrungi at the Ganeshkhind end of the Vetal hill complex. The original hill of Vetal complex has four shringas (horns/peaks) thus forming the name for the once cave-dwelling Goddess. The “swayambhu” (self-emanating) mother Goddess of Chaturshrungi residing in a womb-like cave from “little tradition” was later revived and connected to “great tradition” via a mythical story. A distinguished money lender during the Peshwa period, Durlabhshet Mahajan was an ardent devotee of goddess Saptashrungi (one of the Shakti peetha) near Vani, Nasik. As he found it difficult to visit Saptashrungi due to old age, the goddess willingly offered to appear at a rock-cut cave near Pune. On exploration, Durlabhshet found a rounded stone as a manifestation of the goddess. The temple was built in 1786, the goddess was revived and subsequently brahminised, too. It is pertinent to note that presence of a folk mother goddess may have existed before this revival. It can be seen through presence of many aniconic stones covered in vermilion in precincts of temples dating to pre-Peshwa times. The yatra of goddess Chaturshrungi is held with great pomp and show during the Navratri and Dusserah festivals. Mhatoba (also Mhaskoba or mhasoba) is a buffalo- headed folk God venerated by animal herding pastoral communities of the Deccan peninsula. It was later adapted by agrarian communities and is commonly seen serving the function of a Kshetrapal (guardian deity) on the boundaries of human settlements. One can find a shrine of Mhasoba at the foot hills of Parvati hill and it also serves as a “gram daivat” of the Dattawadi settlement along river banks. But, a much older Mhatoba is located on western ends of the Vetal hill complex. It originally came from Mawal area in the west and serves as satellite site of Mhatoba of vilalges of Wakad and Hinjewadi. According to distinguished archaeologist Damodar D Kosambi, the Mhatoba of Pune hill was brought in by herdsman from Wakad where it existed before 1678 CE. Mhatoba at Pune hill exists in the form of red-daubed boulder along with his wife Jogubai or Jogeshwari. Mhatoba of the Mhatoba hill end is meant pay respect to goddess Tukai near the Sutaardara area of Vetal hill complex. Kosambi has reported various microliths near the original shrine which has regrettably been modernised beyond recognition. As the Vetal hill complex has been frequented by Punekars exercising, a modern Maruti (signifying power and bravery) is established as “Hanuman” and “Apla Maruti” is enshrined at the Law college end on a path towards the Vetal hill top. The scrubby thorny wilderness of dry deciduous nature on the hills was perceived as forests by the erstwhile Punekars, and wilderness was recognised in the form of folk Gods guarding these sacred spaces. This has manifested in the form of sacred grove-like protected wilderness of a natural place. Goddesses Taljai and Waghjai and even the local goddess Parvati of pre-Peshwa eras are best examples of such mother guardian spirits. These hill deities epitomise the living connections of Punekars even today, as they guard the urban greens, critical for a quality urban life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sutradharas-tales-the-rustic-divinity-of-pune-s-deities-of-the-hills-101628074302240.html

04-08-2021||Chandigarh||Six years after sacrilege incidents in Punjab, two eyewitnesses surface||Six years after the sacrilege incidents at Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala villages in Faridkot district, two eyewitnesses have come forward to say that they saw four followers of the Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda pasting derogatory posters near gurdwaras on the night of September 24, 2015. In its chargesheet, the Punjab Police special investigation team (SIT) has said that the two eyewitnesses, Harnam Singh and Harnek Singh, saw the dera followers pasting the posters separately and identified them. Also read: No plans to tweak Citizenship Amendment Act, include other minorities: Parl toldHarnam and Harnek have not recorded their statements before any inquiry commission, including the Justice Ranjit Singh Commission, before this. This could be crucial evidence for the SIT-led by inspector general of police SPS Parmar. In May, the Parmar-led SIT had arrested Sukhjinder Singh, Ranjit Singh, Shakti Singh and Baljit Singh for pasting derogatory posters at Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village. On July 20, the SIT filed a chargesheet against the accused, copies of which were handed over to them on Tuesday. On May 25, Harnam appeared before the SIT to join investigation. He identified Ranjit and Sukhjinder, claiming that he saw them at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala on the night of the incident. He said he did not pay much attention at that time as he thought they might be pasting a religious poster. “In the morning, I found out about the derogatory posters, but I was not aware of the identity of both persons. The CBI recorded my statement but never called me for identification of any suspect. Today, I am identifying Ranjit Singh, he was the one who pasted the posters and Sukhjinder was accompanying him,” he said. CBI did not pay attention to leads The other witness, Harnek Singh, said that he saw Shakti and Baljit pasting posters at Bargari village on September 24, 2015. “I even went to the CBI officials to inform them, but they did not listen to me. I saw their pictures in a newspaper in May this year and identified them through pictures with SIT officials,” he said. An official said both eyewitnesses testified after the arrest of the accused in May. “They have not recorded any statement before this. Now, there are eyewitnesses, so the SIT is moving forward with strong evidence,” he said. The chargesheet reads that the case was traced by the SIT led by former IG RS Khattra during the probe of the 2011 Moga violence case. “But the CBI did not pay attention to the leads provided by the SIT in these cases and emphasised on proving Punjab Police wrong,” the SIT said. Bid to avenge insult to dera The SIT also added confessional statements of all accused in which they confessed to the crime. The accused said that they carried out the sacrilege on the directions of dera follower Mohinder Pal Bittu, who was killed in Nabha jail, to avenge the insult of the dera by a Sikh preacher. Bittu got instructions from the dera. Justice Ranjit Singh Commission report’s finding regarding the three sacrilege cases is also part of the SIT report. The chargesheets filed by the SIT in Gurusar Bhagta (Bathinda) and Malke (Moga) sacrilege cases are also attached.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/six-years-after-sacrilege-incidents-in-punjab-two-eyewitnesses-surface-101628071961191.html

The policy is yet to be finalised,” Bhardwaj said.Lawyer Ruchi Kohli, appearing for the Haryana government, said it would need three weeks to invite objections and finalise the draft housing plan for the slum dwellers.Also Read: Housing is critical for the environment | HT EditorialThe bench, which posted the case for hearing on August 25, asked MCF to submit its final status report on the demolition and directed the finalisation of the rehabilitation policy before the hearing.MCF started the demolition of structures in April this year following the Supreme Court orders to clear encroachments from Aravali forest land in February 2020.On June 3, the bench gave MCF six weeks to complete the demolition.The corporation wasn’t able to complete the exercise within this deadline and at a hearing on July 23, was given time till August 23 to complete the demolition.While granting this request, the Supreme Court bench also responded to complaints by some residents of the village that the administration was acting swiftly against the poor but has spared the rich who built farmhouses and commercial structures.Also Read: UN human rights experts call on India to halt evictions in Faridabad’s KhoriMCF was ordered to make sure all encroachments were removed. “Our direction to remove all structures on forest land applies to all structures without any exception,” the bench emphasised.On Tuesday, owners of some properties who rent out their premises for marriage functions also approached the court, saying MCF sent them notices for erecting boundary walls on forest land.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi who appeared for these persons told the court that they were not on forest land and their business is protected by orders passed by the Supreme Court in a pending case filed in 2013.The bench said: “If the MCF is of the firm opinion that the structure pertains to forest land, they will be free to proceed in terms of our order and demolish it. If it is not on forest land, then do not carry out any action till Friday.” The bench allowed the applicants to approach the authorities concerned on Wednesday with proof that the land is not forest land and directed the application to be listed on Friday along with the 2013 case files by which the applicants were protected.At Tuesday’s hearing, the court also heard complaints from Khori village occupants that people evicted by the corporation were not being provided temporary shelter or food. Senior lawyer Sanjay Parikh, appearing for one set of occupants, said the villagers were told to go to the nearby Radhasoami Satsang ashram which has a capacity to accommodate 50 persons but has close to a lakh people.He was supported by senior advocate Colin Gonsalves appearing for another set of dwellers.The bench said only those who are eligible as per the new policy will be rehabilitated. “For temporary shelter, we have permitted you to approach the commissioner.” In response, the corporation said food, medical support, ambulances, trucks for transportation, and temporary shelter at the nearby premises of Radhaaoami Satsang was being provided.The court asked the corporation to depute a nodal officer at the Radhasoami premises so that the Khori dwellers do not have to travel all the way to meet the commissioner. In addition, the bench allowed grievances to be made through email and asked MCF to provide the necessary details.The status report to be filed by the Corporation on the next date shall mention details of representations received and the outcome achieved, the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/khori-supreme-court-gives-haryana-3-weeks-to-finalise-rehabilitation-scheme-101628071601267.html

The Cabinet approval for AIIMS was granted in September last year.

A total of 200 acres land on DMCH campus was earmarked for AIIMS for which the union Cabinet had granted its approval. AIIMS was to be constructed at an estimated cost of ₹1264 crore in 48 months.According to Bihar information and public relations department minister Sanjay Kumar Jha, “After providing 200 acres of land for the construction of AIIMS in Darbhanga, the Bihar government has also given administrative and expenditure approval to spend ₹13.23 crore for soil filling and levelling on it.

04-08-2021||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh moves Bombay HC, seeks orders to disband Chandiwal Commission||Former Mumbai police commissioner (CP) Param Bir Singh on Wednesday moved the Bombay high court (HC) seeking orders to disband Justice (retired) Kailas Uttamchand Chandiwal’s enquiry commission days after the one-person probe rejected Singh’s objection to its maintainability. The state government on March 30 appointed a single-member commission headed by the former judge to probe the allegations that Singh made in a letter to the chief minister regarding the then home minister Anil Deshmukh, whom he accused of running an extortion racket. The panel was given six months to examine whether Singh submitted proof to establish that Deshmukh or any staffer from his office committed any offence/ misconduct as alleged in the letter; whether specific allegations raised by Singh merited investigation by the state Anti-Corruption Bureau or any other agency; as well as to offer any recommendations that it deemed fit. Singh, currently posted as the Commandant General, Maharashtra Home Guards, moved the HC to challenge the commission’s July 30 rejection of his objection to its continuation. Also Read | Deshmukh skips ED summons again, claims probe neither fair nor impartialSingh contended that the issues referred to the commission were already adjudicated on by the Bombay HC and the Supreme Court and thus there was no need for the Chandiwal probe. Singh’s petition stated that the HC on April 5 ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct a preliminary enquiry into Singh’s allegations against Deshmukh. The Supreme Court upheld the HC’s conclusion that Singh’s letter prima facie disclosed cognisable offence and required probe by an independent agency. On July 22, HC dismissed separate petitions filed by Deshmukh and the state government for quashing of the FIR registered by the CBI against Deshmukh on April 21. In the petition filed through advocate Anukul Seth, Singh contended that in the backdrop of the court orders nothing remained for the Chandiwal Commission to enquire into. “Once the CBI has registered the FIR, the recommendation by the Enquiry Committee as to whether investigation by an independent agency is required or not is rendered meaningless,” said the petition. “There is no purpose to be achieved by such a recommendation.” “The only purpose of the enquiry committee is to aid the State of Maharashtra to decide whether the contents of letter dated 20.03.2021 disclose an offense or not and whether the same are required to be investigated by an investigation agency,” states Singh’s petition. “One a definitive judgment has been delivered by the High Court and the Supreme Court on this very issue, very purpose of the Enquiry Committee does not survive,” the petition adds. On March 20, three days after he was transferred out of the post of Mumbai CP, Singh shot off a letter to the CM and other officials, alleging that Deshmukh used to intermittently summon some Mumbai police officers, including the then deputy commissioner of police (enforcement) Raju Bhujbal, assistant commissioner of police Sanjay Patil (social service branch) and dismissed assistant inspector Sachin Vaze, to his official residence. Deshmukh gave the officers a target to collect ₹100 crore every month from dance bars, hookah parlours and bars and restaurants in Mumbai, Singh alleged in his letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/param-bir-singh-moves-bombay-hc-seeks-orders-to-disband-chandiwal-commission-101628065360240.html

04-08-2021||Bangalore||29 ministers to be sworn into Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai’s Cabinet today||At least 29 legislators will be sworn in as ministers in chief minister Basavaraj Bommai’s Cabinet on Wednesday, ending speculation around the new leadership that was necessitated to contain the simmering political crisis in Karnataka. “Last night, final talks got over. List is ready now. I’ve sent it to Raj Bhavan. Twenty-nine ministers will take oath today [Wednesday],” Bommai said. He added that there will be no deputy chief minister this time, which, according to political experts, appears to be a way not to antagonise any leader and community after Bommai was chosen over several others for the top post. Bommai said that there are seven legislators from backward classes, three from scheduled castes, one from a scheduled tribe, seven Vokkaligas and eight Lingayats. Shashikala Jolle is the sole woman in the Cabinet. Political experts said the delay in the Cabinet formation indicates the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Centre has taken over most decision-making processes in Karnataka. Also Read | HC notice to BSY, son in corruption case“For the last two days, all seniors have discussed this (Cabinet) in detail, and there are just two issues left,” Bommai said on Wednesday. The issues that Bommai referred to likely include the number of deputy chief ministers and former chief minister BS Yediyurappa’s insistence on including his son, BY Vijayendra, in the Cabinet, people aware of the developments said. The Central leadership of BJP, people aware of the developments said, is yet to warm up to the idea, which also mens that Vijayendra might be given a chance to contest the bypolls from Hangal in Haveri district. Bommai said that Vijayendra is not in the existing list. Meanwhile, BJP legislators rushed to Bengaluru--some in the hope of getting a call from the chief minister over their inclusion in the Cabinet and others to protest if their names were missing from the list. “Sir, did you get a call?” was the most popular and frequently posed question by TV journalists camping at Vidhana Soudha since Wednesday morning. The Opposition has criticised the BJP and Bommai for not prioritising the floods that have ravaged over 13 districts in the state and the imminent third wave of Covid- 19 infections. Bommai, however, has been more fortunate than his mentor and predecessor, Yediyurappa, who was not given a Cabinet for over a month, leaving the then 76-year-old to handle one of the worst floods in the state in 2019 by himself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/29-ministers-to-be-sworn-into-karnataka-cm-basavaraj-bommai-s-cabinet-today-101628060319967.html

Contradicting the claim of the land brokers that his father sold the land in 1993, Dr De said, “I have received the rent from the state food corporation (SFC) office which was run in the building till last month when the office was shifted.” Station house officer (SHO) of additional Khazanchi Hat police station Sanjay Kumar Singh said, “We have visited the disputed plot and summoned both the sides to the police station.” He added, “The person against whom land-grabbing charge has been levelled showed his documents whereas Dr De has not yet turned up.” Purnia district Bar Association chief Bibhakar Singh assured Dr De of full legal support. “This is also related to law and order problem,” Singh said.Dr De’s advocate Sudip Roy alleged the broker got the land deed in connivance with the staff of registry office and on the basis of that forged documents, mutation of the land was also done in the office of circle officer of Purnia East block.“The nexus between land brokers, police and officials forced hundreds of Bengali families to leave Purnia in the last two decades,” he said. He informed that a title suit over the grabbed land has been filed at the court. Bihar Bengali Association is yet to come forward in support of Dr De. There are about 5,000 Bengali families in Purnia division-consisting of four districts-Katihar, Araria, Kishanganj besides Purnia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/doctor-in-kolkata-alleges-brokers-grabbed-his-land-in-bihar-s-purnia-101628046698450.html

04-08-2021||Delhi||Life-saving surgery on 2-year-old weighing 45kg||City doctors performed a life-saving bariatric surgery on a two-year-old baby whose 45kg weight left her incapable of walking or crawling and posed a serious health risk. A healthy weight for a child her age is between 12kg and 15kg.The doctors said that as per medical literature, the toddler, Khyati Varshney, is the youngest child to undergo weight loss surgery in the country.The doctors from Max Hospital in Patparganj, where the toddler Khyati has been undergoing treatment for over a year, were unable to pinpoint the reason why she was putting on excess weight that caused sleep apnoea, a condition where the breathing stops and restarts repeatedly during sleep.A sleep test conducted by her doctors, days before her surgery, showed that her oxygen saturation dropped to 75% in her sleep. Normally, people maintain oxygen saturation between 95% and 100%. Covid-19 patients with oxygen saturation below 94% are encouraged to go to a hospital.Khyati’s parents started noticing excess weight when she was three months old. “People dismissed it saying that she is from a well-to-do family. At six months, she weighed over 15kg. Before the surgery, she was 45kg when her mother weighed 50kg,” said her father Rahul Varshney.Doctors said they were unable to find any hormonal or genetic reason for her obesity, adding that it had nothing to with her diet as she started putting on weight even when she was on mother’s milk.“It could be a genetic condition that we still do not know of. She doesn’t eat any junk food, she doesn’t like sweets too much – so it is not a case of food making the child obese,” said Dr Vivek Bindal, head of Max Institute of Minimal Access, Bariatric, and Robotic Surgery.Doctors said Khyati is the youngest child to get a bariatric surgery. “There is a case of a 2.6-year-old child of 36 kg [undergoing weight-loss surgery] that is reported in medical literature. As far as we know, this is the youngest child to get the life-saving surgery. She may have died without it,” said Dr Bindal.Worried about the excessive weight gain, the parents encouraged doctors to try bariatric surgery on her even though it is not usually considered for children below 12 years old because of the lifestyle changes it entails.Among the challenges faced by doctors were a lack of medical equipment for bariatric surgery on children and no fixed guidelines to decide doses of medicines, anaesthetics or even ventilator settings.“If the ventilator settings were set for a 45kg person, her lungs would not have been able to deal with the pressure. But if we gave it according to a two-year-old, it would not have helped as her chest is heavy. We had to plan for all eventualities,” said Dr Rajiv Uttam, paediatric intensive care specialist.Dr Arun Puri, the anaesthetist, said that five days after the surgery, Khyati’s sleep apnoea started improving and her snoring, one of the symptoms of the condition, stopped completely. “This could pave the way for the surgery becoming available for other obese children in the future,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lifesaving-surgery-on-2-year-old-weighing-45kg-101628034599486.html
04-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police makes 11 stations child friendly: Colourful walls, books, games||Vibrant graffiti covered walls, eclectic chairs, colouring books and board games — no, this isn’t the description of a play school, but of the colourful corners one can now witness at a police station! Children are brought to the police station owing to a number of reasons. And, to ensure their experience is comfortable, Delhi Police has launched ‘child-friendly centres’ at 11 police stations in the Northwest district. The initiative was launched in a bid to address a few concerns when it comes to children. “We often rescue kids who have been kidnapped or get lost. They have to spend some time in the station while we trace their parents or arrange a shelter. Sometimes, kids are brought in to record their statements against a perpetrator, or are victims of abuse. Occasionally, juveniles who are held for petty crimes need to be counselled — all these require their presence in a police station. Children are impressionable, and we understood that changes had to be incorporated to make our stations safe, comfortable spaces,” says Usha Rangnani, DCP (Northwest), under whose guidance the centres have been set up. One can spot, in these child-friendly corners, a host of toys, educational games, notebooks, colouring books, drinking water and food. The fixtures and fittings, too, are child-friendly, and a female officer is stationed in each corner to tend to the kids. “Complainants often come to the station along with their kids, and are seen speaking to the inspector while taking care of their child. Now, they can simply allow the child to play in the room designated for them, and interact with the police with ease,” says Dinesh Kumar, station house office (SHO) Model Town Police Station.What’s more, the centres will double up as a crèche for children of police personnel. “I have a 1.5-year-old daughter. When I had night shifts, I’d have to leave her at home. But now, I can comfortably bring her with me to work, and feed her whenever required. I know many women like me, who are extremely happy that such centres have come up. Many children, not just our own, would benefit from having a comfortable space to interact with police officers,” opines Vandana, a constable at Ashok Vihar Police Station.

04-08-2021||Delhi||At 98.07%, record students pass in Class||Schools in the national capital registered a record overall pass percentage of 98.07%, 12.41 percentage points higher than the previous year’s 85.86%, in the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class 10 exams results announced on Wednesday.The CBSE used an alternative method of assessment this year after the government cancelled the Class 10 exams on April 15. Last year, the CBSE conducted board exams for most subjects but the pandemic halted the process with students not being able to write tests for some subjects.The improvement in overall performance of Delhi schools was led by the government-run institutions where the pass percentage went up from 82.61% in 2020 to 97.52% this year. The government schools recorded a pass percentage of 68.9% in 2017-18 and 71.6% in 2018-19.Similarly, the overall pass percentage of private schools also improved from last year’s 91.29% to 99.54% in Delhi East region. In Delhi West region, it shot up to 99.61% from last year’s 89.09%.Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia congratulated the students: “I am proud to state that 97.52% of Delhi government school students have passed and 186 government school children have scored more than 95%. It is the result of the governance model of @ArvindKejriwal ji that Delhi government schools are setting an example in the whole country.”Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also congratulated the students. “Many congratulations to the children, their parents and team education,” he tweeted.According to the data provided by the Delhi government, of the 1,008 schools from which Class 10 students were assessed, 750 achieved 100% results.The average Quality Index (QI), which reflects the performance of each student, in government schools has also increased to 278.3 this year from 265.31 in 2020.Several government school principals said the alternative evaluation criteria helped their students.Under the alternate assessment criteria, students have been evaluated on the basis of their performances in exams conducted at the school level, including unit tests, mid-term/half-yearly exams, and the pre-boards, following the cancellation of their final examinations in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The CBSE had also asked schools to keep their overall passing percentage in line with their best performance in Class 10 final exams in the last three years. The board has allowed schools to moderate marks within a range of plus or minus 2 obtained by the school in the subject in the reference year.“Schools picked their best performance in the last three years and marked students on its basis. It has majorly benefitted average students. Overall, this was the best board could have come up with in the pandemic year,” said Awadesh Kumar Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed School in Rohini, which has recorded 100% result this year.Explaining the major possible reason behind the improvement in overall pass percentage, Ashok Pandey, director of Ahlcon Schools that also registered 100% pass percentage, said, “The results were prepared on the basis of internal assessments that covered short units (syllabus), and were of short duration. In fact, the major portion of these tests or exams were multiple choice type or short answer type questions. Naturally, children tend to do well in such exams. The problem begins when exams happen for longer hours with long answer type questions. This only highlights the importance of continuous school-based assessment.”The majority of private schools said their result was in accordance with their previous year performances. Meenakshi Khushwaha, principal of Birla Vidya Niketan in Pushp Vihar, said, “Our results are almost the same as normal boards . We followed all the norms. There is no difference as such and we are satisfied with it.”Students also expressed relief after the end of an exhaustive pandemic-hit academic year. Hiten Goyal, 15, a student of RPVV Surajmal Vihar, has scored 478 out of 500 marks in Class 10. His father, an electrician, suffered financial losses due to the lockdown. “It’s a challenging year both academically and financially. There was a time when my father did not get work due to the pandemic. But my family did not let it affect my studies. I am happy with the results and satisfied that this long wait is finally over,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/at-98-07-record-students-pass-in-class-101628031290416.html
04-08-2021||Delhi||Vaccination karwaya hai? Ask Delhi-NCR residents before hiring help||Finding a domestic help is, as it is, a tedious task for many. But, denizens are now faced with one more challenge — finding a vaccinated house help. With a third wave of Covid-19 anticipated to hit the country in just a few weeks from now, residents of Delhi-NCR are being all the more vigilant and making sure that they hire part-time helpers only once they are vaccinated. “We are getting so many calls every day for helpers and nannies, but everyone is very particular about the maids being vaccinated. They tell us, ‘Dono nahin toh ek vaccination shot laga ke hi lana’. In fact, even after this [ensuring vaccination], we do an RT-PCR test and only then send them,” says Delhi-based Jibin Alex, owner of a firm that provides nannies, nurses and maids.Some people are going the extra mile and investing time in educating their helps about the importance of getting vaccinated, one such individual being Ishita Bhatt. “My part-time maid was very scared of vaccination. She and her family used to feel if they go in for free vaccination, they might fall sick ya marr jayenge. I told her we will get the paid one done for her. Gradually, she understood why it was necessary to get vaccinated. I also told her that if she doesn’t get a jab, we won’t be able to keep her,” says the Gurugram-based environment consultant. Some residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) are taking upon themselves the onus of ensuring that domestic helps get the jab. “Recently, we held a vaccination drive for maids and other workers. We have even compensated those who got their shots outside,” shares Prabhat Bhardwaj, RWA president of Central Park 2, Gurugram. And, domestic helps seem to have realised that if they want to remain employed, getting jabbed is the only way. “Pichle saal se hi kum kaam hai, kyunki lockdown mein nahin aa sakte the hum. Iss baar bhi bahut kum logo ne humein aane diya. Sab puchte hai ‘vaccination karwayi hai kya?’ Ab samajh gaye hain, kaam karna hai toh injection lagwana padega,” says Seetha, a domestic worker.

04-08-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Birdwatcher of Munirka Enclave||Kandala. Such an uncommon name. “It means ‘golden’ and indicates someone who has the properties of gold, such as beautiful, precious, rare,” says Kandala Singh. The word is from Punjabi, her mother tongue.A poet, Ms Singh lives in south Delhi’s Munirka Enclave. It is a neighbourhood that “gives me plenty of fodder for poetry—interactions on the terrace with neighbours during lockdown, messages on the colony WhatsApp group, the Ashoka trees, the cacophonous chorus of birds twice a day.”In her 30s, she finished composing Birdwatching this month last year. She wrote the first draft in a single day but “went back and forth on this poem over the next four months, revising and editing, and re-revising with the inputs of a poetry partner.”She feels especially attached to this poem, for it touches upon the “emotional truths and contradictions” of domestic violence. Ms Singh is a survivor of gender violence who also works on gender issues as a researcher and activist.“We don’t always manage to make room for these nuances. Perpetrators of violence are often painted with an unidimensional lens. The lived experience of violence is far more complicated.” Poetry can hold room for these contradictions, she believes.Ms Singh agrees to share the poem with us, which first appeared in the US-based poetry journal Rust + Moth.BirdwatchingMy mother says it was the peacockthat did it, the reason I said papabefore mama.

Instead of having to shut down at 4pm, he can now operate till 10pm, according to the new guidelines that came into effect in Mumbai from Tuesday. “We had decent sales on the first day of extension of timings. This 4pm deadline to shut shops was not feasible,” he added. As part of the Maharashtra government’s decision to partially lift lockdown restrictions, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) allowed opening of shops till 10pm on all days, which was earlier till 4pm on weekdays. The BMC on Tuesday clarified that shopping malls will remain shut and restaurants will be allowed to remain open till 4pm on all days. Earlier, restaurants were allowed to remain functional only on weekdays, with night curfew in the city between 11pm and 5am. Maharashtra on Tuesday recorded 6,005 Covid-19 new cases with 177 deaths, while Mumbai reported 291 new cases with three deaths. The number of cases in Maharashtra has reached 6,321,068, while deaths reached 133,215. There are currently 74,318 active patients across the state, in which Pune tops with 15,552 patients, followed by Sangli, with 7,301 active patients and Satara with 6,848. The number of cases in Mumbai reached 735,657 with 15,911 deaths till date. Despite demands by commuters’ associations and political parties like the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), the state has decided not to allow general public to travel by Mumbai suburban trains, as it is wary of Covid transmission. Like Parmar, thousands of shopkeepers in Mumbai heaved a sigh of relief as the BMC relaxed the timings for shops till 10pm from Tuesday. However, the decision has caused restaurant owners to cry foul, as they still have to close their establishments by 4pm. Restaurant owners have warned of an agitation, with the Vasai taluka Hotel Association organising a 60-km protest march on Wednesday. The Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), an apex body of hoteliers, said they are now gearing for a fight. “They are portraying us as spreaders of Covid-19 and we will fight to the end. We have a right for our livelihood,” said Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, spokesperson, HRAWI. Major hotel associations will meet on Wednesday to chalk out their course of action.The shopkeepers have welcomed the move. “There is positivity among shopkeepers due to this decision. Now we can operate our shops during normal working hours,” said Mitesh Mody, who owns an electronic outlet at Lamington Road.However, many of the employees who travel long distance are unhappy as they are not being allowed on local trains. “I have been without a proper job for the past two years and surviving doing petty works in my area. It is impossible for me to travel to Dadar everyday by bus,” said Raju Khakre, who lives in Kalyan.The Mumbai civic body has also allowed all indoor and outdoor sports activities, except swimming pools and all other sports related activities where close physical contact is required. However, corporators have complained there is no logic in allowing outdoor sports activities on all days of the week, but keeping gardens and playgrounds daily only between 5am and 9am. Asif Zakaria, Congress corporator from Bandra said, “I do not see any logic in keeping the gardens and open spaces shut in the evening hours.” Meanwhile, non-essential shops in Thane will now be allowed to remain open till 10pm from Monday to Saturday and will be closed on Sunday, while the essential shops can remain open till 10pm on all days. The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation too has issued similar notification, however, gardens in Navi Mumbai will not open even for morning walkers and joggers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/day-1-of-relaxations-mumbai-s-shop-owners-get-relief-101628021195609.html
04-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Kasturba Hospital to start tests to detect variants next week||The Kasturba Gandhi hospital in Chinchpokli installed genome sequencing machines in their laboratory on Tuesday. The hospital will begin conducting tests to identify variants of Sars-Cov-2 – the virus that causes Covid-19 – from next week, making it the first civic-run hospital to conduct whole genome sequencing in Mumbai.The high speed machine can run tests on 380 samples per round. The civic body will incur a cost of ₹10,000 for testing each sample. The machines will be inaugurated by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday. Genome sequencing is an exercise to study the changes in the structure of the virus over time. A combination of changes in the ribonucleic acid of the virus can give birth to a new variant. Currently, it takes over two-three months to get test results of genome sequencing which delays the epidemiological study of the mutated virus in infected patients. With the starting of the laboratory, the results of 380 samples will be available within three-four days. Dr Jayanti Shastri, in-charge of the molecular diagnostic reference laboratory of the hospital, said, “These tests have three phases—library presentation which in simple form is called pre-sequencing preparation, which takes two-three days. Then we do the sequencing of the samples in the machine that generally takes 4-5 hours. In the third stage, we do analysis of the results to understand the variations.”Genome sequencing is not a diagnostic tool, so suspected Covid-19 patients will have to mandatorily undergo RT-PCR tests for diagnosis. “Unlike RT-PCR, which is a target-based testing, sequencing helps identify unknown pathogens. This will help understand the genetic coding of viruses,” she said. The samples will be collected through the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) from international passengers, Covid-19 hot spots, places with high transmission rate, among others. Genome sequencing can also provide better diagnosis among patients showing unusual clinical presentations. “For instance, if a patient is negative for Covid-19, but symptoms indicate the presence of Sars-Cov-2, then sequencing can help us understand the nucleotides,” she added.The machines have been procured through donations that cumulatively cost around ₹10.5 crore.A US-based company has donated ₹6.4 crore, while Mumbai-based ATE Chandra Foundation has donated ₹4 crore for the machine. “An alumnus from our college (BYL Nair hospital) is the reason why we got support from the US company. He facilitated the talks and convinced them to donate,” she said. HT had reported earlier that due to Covid-19 restrictions in international cargo ferrying, the hospital had to wait for months to get the machine from Chicago. “This (genome sequencing) will be a great help in understanding and researching on the new virus Sars-Cov-2. It may give some hidden keys to the puzzles of the virus which may help us plan better,” she added.Since the outbreak of the second wave in the middle of February, three patients with Delta plus variants have been identified. All of them have recovered from the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-kasturba-hospital-to-start-tests-to-detect-variants-next-week-101628020955419.html

04-08-2021||Chandigarh||SKM leader Balbir Rajewal’s posters as next Punjab CM surface in Khanna||Posters exhorting residents to make Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leader Balbir Singh Rajewal the next Punjab chief minister have surfaced in Khanna town of Ludhiana district. The posters have come up close on the heels of Haryana Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Gurnam Singh Charuni’s suspension from the SKM over his suggestion that the Punjab farmer organisations involved in the agitation against the Centre’s three farm laws should contest the assembly polls next year. Some shopkeepers in the city’s mini-market claimed to have put up the posters, saying they wish to see Rajewal as the Punjab CM. Jagdeep Singh, a trader, said people of the state voted for the parties that promised the moon before the elections but never bothered to address the grievances of farmers and small shopkeepers after coming to power. “The SKM leader is talking about upliftment of farmer and small businessmen, which gives us a hope of a better future. It is up to Rajewal whether he wishes to contest the elections or not,” he added. Rajewal, who is currently in Delhi, expressed surprise over the posters, saying he has no plans to take a plunge into politics. “Such incidents only distract the focus of people from repealing of the three farm laws. I have never talked about contesting the elections. We do not know who put up the posters. We are going to file a complaint as it needs to be investigated,” said Rajewal over phone. These posters have been put up when a parallel Parliament is being run by the farmers against the central government in Delhi, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/skm-leader-balbir-rajewal-s-posters-as-next-punjab-cm-surface-in-khanna-101628020658651.html

The doctors, who are agitating against delinking of the non-practicing allowance (NPA) from the basic pay, did not allow civil surgeon Dr TS Dhillon to enter his office.Vinod Kumar, a patient, had come for the dressing of a boil only to find the OPD block locked. “I had pain and need medical attention. But there is no one to take care of the patients,” he said.Bikker Singh from Kothe Phoola Singh Wala village was worried about missing the last date of medical examination to get an arms licence. “It is mandatory to get a dope test for a new licence or for its renewal. I have to submit the medical certification by a government doctor by Thursday,” he said.Surjan Singh, a resident of Nahinawala village said he had to consult an ENT specialist for an infection in his ear. “It is the third instance today that doctors are unavailable at the OPD. Doctors may have justified demands but patients’ care should not be ignored,” he said.Jasbir Kaur had come from Jaitu in Faridkot district to consult a psychiatrist. “I came with my mother only to see that doctors are away from work today. We have limited resources and cannot afford to visit the hospital repeatedly,” she said.Civil surgeon Dr Dhillon said the doctors are attending only the emergency cases or Covid-related duties. “I am working from home due to the protest outside my office.

From markets to residential areas, the city was two-three feet under water. Besides low-lying areas, water entered houses in residential colonies outside the walled city.Besides spending lakhs on the cleanliness of the drainage lines in city, the authorities had claimed to be monsoon ready. Rain, however, has washed away such claims. Deputy commissioner Kumar Amit, MC commissioner Poonamdeep Kaur and mayor Sanjeev Sharma Bittu went around the city to inspect the situation. Shopkeepers had a harrowing time saving their goods from rainwater. The Government TB Hospital, in Rajindra Hospital, near the Mall Road submerged. Baljinder Singh, of Khalsa Mohalla, questioned the MC preparedness. “What’s the use of spending crores of rupees on the cleanliness of the drainage system, if there is no respite from water-logging?”Mayor Bittu added that officials and staff were at work, draining out water. “With the laying of drainage and sewage lines in most parts of the city, we have somehow managed to tackle water-logging situation. We have our teams in the field to redress grievances of residents.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/patiala-submerged-as-water-logging-continues-to-plague-royal-city-101628020535489.html
04-08-2021||Kolkata||Submit report, orders Calcutta HC after Suvendu Adhikari aide arrested again||KOLKATA: A two-judge bench of the Calcutta high court asked the West Bengal government to submit a report on the arrest of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Suvendu Adhikari’s aide, Rakhal Bera, after a judge granted him bail and barred the police from arresting him again without the court’s permission, Bera’s lawyer Lokenath Chatterjee said on Tuesday.Justice Rajasekhar Mantha on Monday granted bail to Rakhal Bera and shielded him from arrests by the police on the ground that he had been repeatedly arrested in new cases after getting bail in other cases.“The state is once again directed to submit a list of all cases pending against the petitioner anywhere in the state. This court is also inclined to direct that all police stations in the state may register any FIR against the petitioner but he shall not be arrested without the express leave of this court,” Justice Mantha ordered.On Tuesday, the West Bengal government approached the two-judge bench challenging the immunity from arrest granted by Justice Mantha. The division bench comprising justices Tapabrata Chakraborty and Subhasis Dasgupta was hearing the case, Chatterjee said, when “the court was informed that instead of being released from jail, Rakhal Bera had been shown as arrested in connection with another case registered at Nandakumar police station in East Midnapore district on June 16. We told the division bench that the arrest is illegal, especially after the court holding (on Monday) that the cases were politically motivated,” said Bera’s lawyer said. Chatterjee said the division bench asked the state government to submit a report on Wednesday to ascertain why Bera was arrested again.Rakhal Bera, an aide of Adhikari, the leader of the opposition in the Bengal legislative assembly, was arrested by the Kolkata Police on June 7 in a job scam case filed in East Midnapore district. In this case, Bera, a resident of East Midnapore, has been accused of taking ₹2 lakh from a man in 2018-19 by promising a job in the irrigation department that Adhikari headed at that time. Adhikari joined the BJP in December last year. Four cases were registered against Bera in East Midnapore in June and the fifth one was registered at the Manicktala police station in Kolkata on July 1. In his order on Monday, justice Mantha said the Bera was being punished by the ruling dispensation for changing his political affiliation and for being close to the present leader of the opposition by foisting false cases against him.“There appears to be a pattern being followed by police in coordination with one another in attempting to keep the petitioner in custody by hook or crook on one pretext or the other and by registering one FIR after the other,” the judge said in his order. HT has seen a copy of the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/submit-report-orders-calcutta-hc-after-suvendu-adhikari-aide-arrested-again-101628020118064.html

Kapurthala district food supply controller Geeta Bishambhu has written to senior superintendent of police (SSP) Harkamalpreet Singh Khakh for legal action against food inspectors Vivek Gupta and Bhupinder Singh. Bishambhu said, “Also, a departmental inquiry was recommended against two other inspectors Vikas Sethi and Rajeshwar Singh to probe their role in the scam to the tune of ₹5 crore.” While Vivek Gupta declined to comment, Bhupinder Singh claimed that he had no role in the alleged rip-off as he was posted in the Fatudhinga area of Sultanpur Lodhi sub-division. Food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu had suspended four food inspectors for not disbursing wheat to eligible beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act after the HT reported the scam on June 25. Bishambhu conducted a probe after Sultanpur Lodhi MLA Navtej Singh Cheema and members of the Kisan Union lodged multiple complaints over non-disbursement of wheat from October 2020 to March 2021 to beneficiaries. It was found that the department’s Sultanpur Lodhi centre didn’t provide records of wheat distribution to the inspection teams despite repeated orders.It was noted in the report that the department staff posted at Sultanpur Lodhi was guilty of “grave negligence” and did not even listen to the district circle office. An official privy to the matter said that a senior functionary of the district administration was aware of the matter but opted to remain silent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sultanpur-lodhi-wheat-scam-fir-recommended-against-two-food-supply-inspectors-101628019816586.html

On July 12, Masih, a former member of Punjab Subordinate Service Selection Board and was on interim bail on health grounds, was asked by the court to report in jail within seven days. Masih, however, purportedly consumed a poisonous substance during a protest outside the special task force (STF)’s Amritsar office the next day, alleging police harassment. He was admitted to a private hospital. Masih was supposed to present himself in the court on Monday, but the hearing was adjourned for a day. “The court issued his arrest warrant after Masih didn’t turn up on Tuesday. He is now absconding and our teams are working to nab him,” said STF deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Vawinder Mahajan. The STF had recovered the contraband from a house owned by Masih at the instance of one Sukhbir Singh alias Happy, who was arrested with 6-kg heroin in Mohali. Masih had rented out his house to another accused Sukhwinder Singh since December 2019. The STF had claimed that Masih was taking ₹80,000 monthly rent from the accused and was aware of the fact that a drug smuggling racket was being run on his premises. Later, the police arrested seven people, including Masih and an Afghanistan national. More people, including racket kingpin Simranjit Singh alias Sandhu, were named in the case. The heroin was smuggled from Pakistan via a Gujarat port, it was found in the investigation. The Afghan national was helping the other accused in processing the contraband.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/194kg-heroin-seizure-arrest-warrant-issued-against-absconding-ex-akali-leader-101628019815253.html

The high court acted on the plea of former DGP who had approached it in March and granted him the bail. Subsequently, the high court had quashed the charge sheets filed by Punjab Police on April 9, and the government was asked to constitute a three-member special investigation team (SIT). The high court bench of justice Avneesh Jhingan noted that the DGP was not named in the FIR and it was only on the basis of a challan that he was summoned and also that the charge sheet no longer exists in view of the high court order of April and now there is a fresh investigation by a newly constituted SIT. The court also observed that it will not be appropriate to ignore the factual background of the case as he served the state being an IPS officer and in a 2018 petition, a court examining various aspects involved, including “political colour”, granted a protection that in case he is to be arrested, a clear seven days’ notice should be served. “In view of the change in circumstances during the pendency of this petition, the present petition is disposed of. In case the petitioner is sought to be arrested, one week’s notice shall be given to the petitioner so as to enable him to have recourse to remedies available to him,” the court said while disposing of the plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2015-kotkapura-violence-give-week-s-notice-to-ex-dgp-saini-before-arrest-hc-tells-punjab-police-101628019757724.html

NIA informed the court that the extension of custody of the accused – dismissed cops Sachin Vaze, Riyazuddin Kazi, Sunil Mane and Vinayak Shinde and bookie Naresh Gor – was necessary. The agency has already got a 60-day extension and is seeking more time as under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) they can get custody for a maximum time of 180 days. Vaze was arrested on March 13 by the agency and the other accused were taken into custody in the subsequent days. Special public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves, appearing for NIA, claimed that several witnesses in the cases were threatened and that they have already provided protection to some of the witnesses. People are feared for their lives and not coming ahead as witness. In such a situation if the agency is not given appropriate time to file a charge sheet and the accused are released on bail, it could impact the pending investigation, Gonsalves argued. He also informed the court that NIA is yet to get a reply from Facebook on the account details of the accused and also from Apple about their mobile phones. “We have found several incrementing documents from PS Foundation’s office in Andheri and they are being analysed,” Gonsalves told the court. The agency also said that the accused had given ₹ 45 lakh to contract killers to carry out Hiran’s murder and they are still analysing bank accounts. After murdering Hiran, the accused had travelled to Dubai and Nepal and the evidence is been collected to corroborate the same. “The accused are police officers and they are not co-operating with the agency at all. We have to question 50 traders to find out how the gelatin sticks used in the Antilia explosives case were brought to Mumbai. If the accused could have co-operated, the work could have been reduced,” Gonsalves told court while pressing for his demand to extend the judicial custody of the five accused for 30 more days till the charge sheet is filed. However, the accused through their counsel pressed for their release, citing several judgements of the Apex court and owing to the delay in filing the charge sheet. The accused told the court that they were lodged in Taloja jail and sought time to reply to NIA’s plea for extension of custody and pressed to carry the matter before a regular court as the NIA court was not working on Tuesday. However, NIA told the court that it wanted the matter to be decided early. The court has now posted the matter for further hearing on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/found-several-incriminating-docus-from-ex-mumbai-cop-s-ngo-nia-on-antilia-case-101628019756610.html

In Tarn Taran district, which shares 103-km-long border with the neighbouring country, a massive combing operation is being carried out in the fields situated along the barbed fence. Some farmers, who own agriculture land between the barbed fence and the zero line, are also on the radar of the police. Besides increasing presence at the checkpoints in areas situated near the border, the police are also monitoring the movement of suspicious people closely. Officials believe that drugs and arms smugglers across the border increase their activities ahead of the Independence Day or Republic Day. Just a fortnight ahead of the Independence Day in 2015, three gunmen dressed in army uniform opened fire at a bus and then attacked the Dina Nagar police station in Gurdaspur. Similarly, the Pathankot Air Force station was attacked by a group of heavily armed terrorists ahead of the Republic Day in 2016. “We have made formed several teams for conducting search in the fields situated along the fence. We have inputs that the anti-India elements may send arms or drug consignments ahead of August 15,” said Tarn Taran senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruman H Nimbale. Another police official said, “We are also keeping a strict watch on some farmers whose record is dubious. We have also asked the BSF not to allow these farmers to cross the fence. We are also watching the labourers who go to the fields across the fence.”Nimbale said, “We have set up 24 checkpoints in every area leading to the border in the district. We are also taking pictures of all suspicious people and their identity proofs. We have deployed rapid response teams and commandos to deal with any untoward incident.”In Amritsar district, checkpoints along the border have been strengthened. Attari deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Gurpartap Singh Sahota said, “We are keeping a round-the-clock vigil near the border with a focus on suspicious people roaming in the area.” In Pathankot too, search operation is being carried out at public places and sensitive points along the border.On the intervening night of July 30 and 31, the Border Security Force (BSF) gunned down two suspected intruders who entered the Indian territory from Pakistan near Khalra village of Bhikhiwind sub-division in Tarn Taran. Similarly, on July 19, the Amritsar police had seized 8 pistols and 270 rounds from a field near Khalra village along the barbed fence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ahead-of-i-day-police-mount-vigil-along-indo-pak-border-in-punjab-101628019755351.html

The Opposition walked out of the House after the Speaker rejected their demand. Sharma was found hanging at his Delhi residence on March 17 this year. As soon as the House assembled in the morning, Congress legislator Jagat Negi demanded adjournment of the proceedings under Rule 67, seeking a discussion on the death of the Member of Parliament. Senior Congress legislator Nanda Lal and MLA from Kullu, Sunder Singh Thakur, had also given notice for the adjournment . Negi said Sharma’s son had raised the demand for investigation into death of his father. He said that forensic report was still awaited even after four months of his death. The Speaker, Vipin Singh Parmar, however, rejected the Negi’s demand after which the opposition walked out of the House. Amid the din, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said that Sharma was a BJP MP and “his unfortunate death is a huge loss to the party”. But, Sharma died in Delhi and the Delhi crime branch is investigating the case, said Thakur. The chief minister said that Sharma’s son, however, has sought an investigation as was reported in the newspapers. “ Ram Swaroop ji was a Lok Sabha member and represented the Mandi seat. He won the seat with a massive margin . His death was personally disturbing for me,” he said, adding, “This matter doesn’t come under the jurisdiction of Himachal Pradesh government.” Speaking on the issue, leader of Opposition in the assembly, Mukesh Agnihotri, said that the inquiry must be conducted and the chief minister should write in this regard to the authorities concerned. Dissatisfied with the government reply, the opposition members moved into the well of the House and continued raising slogans. The Speaker tried to pacify the Congress members, citing that the matter cannot be discussed under Rule 67. As the Opposition didn’t budge, the Speaker announced the question hour amid sloganeering prompting. Later, the Opposition staged a walkout. Matter of additional relief on death, disability of NPS staff being examined: CMA total of 2,114 employees covered under New Pension Schemes have died after 2003 in various departments, CM Jai Ram Thakur informed the assembly on Tuesday.

They may take stock of the situation and plan further course of action to prevent illegal mining, register criminal cases for offences involved, ensure seizure of vehicles involved in crime, assess and recover compensation for the violations, take action of cancellation of leases for violations, revocation of consents, criminal prosecution and other steps for protection and restoration of environment, said the tribunal. The orders were passed by the principal bench comprising NGT chairman Justice Adarsh Kumar Goyal and members Justice Sudhir Agarwal, Justice Brijesh Sethi and expert member Nagin Nanda on a petition filed by one Amandeep regarding illegal mining in Som Bhadra (Swan river) in Una. The petitioner alleged that unscientific mining by using earth movers, in utter violation of the norms and under the nose of the local district administration, was causing constant danger to the river and to the channelisation work.The courts ordered that carrying capacity study must be conducted with a view to determine the number of leases to be granted and inter-se distance to be maintained for the same. Monitoring mechanism in place must be reviewed in the light of startling revelation of the continuing failure of the authorities and colluding officers may be identified and made accountable under the environment, criminal and service laws.First such meeting may be organised within 15 days from the order to take stock of the situation and to plan remedial action. The chief secretary and HP DGP may remain personally present by videoconferencing with their action taken reports on next date of hearing, said the green court. Citing the reports by district magistrate Una and five-member independent committee constituted by it, the NGT expressed shock at the extent of violations and helpless shown in taking remedial action. “There appears to be laxity on the part of the police in not controlling overloading of trucks, illegal and mining. Equal failure is of mining department. So is the failure of the State Pollution Control Board and State Environment Impact Assessment Authority for inaction against violation,” said the court.

The CBI had concluded that no clue leading to detection of these three cases could be found. “No eye witness could be found,” it had said. The SIT, however, has claimed that from the peculiar facts and circumstances, it is evident that CBI had overlooked certain relevant, important aspects. “The motive behind these three cases is having direct link with Dera Sacha Sauda; and the accused in these cases are dera followers,” the SIT says. Punjab Police has said that the CBI had given the benefit of doubt to the accused on the ground that there is no CCTV cameras installed on relevant points. “On the other hand, the evidence collected by the SIT, as discussed in the report, clearly reveals the role and participation of each accused in the commission of the crime. The CBI has failed to deeply investigate regarding the CCTV footage available on record showing the movement of a Maruti A-Star car (used in the crime). SIT probe shows that the said car belongs to the father of accused Nishan,” it claimed. “The CBI, in its closure report, has observed despite their extensive efforts no person came forward with credible information. SIt investigation showed that the witnesses who came forward with the information have categorically stated in their statements that they tried approaching the CBI but they didn’t listen to them nor recorded their statements,” the SIT says.The SIT said that as far as lie-detection test and layered voice analysis test of three accused, Bittu, Sukhjinder and Shakti, is concerned, parameters for conducting these tests were not followed, and this is against Supreme Court guidelines. “As per the closure report of the CBI, fingerprints and specimens of handwritings of 49 persons were collected, adding that the CFSL report was received pertaining to only 10 persons.Without waiting for the report of remaining 39 persons, the CBI hurriedly prepared the closure report and filed the same in the CBI court at Mohali,” SIT claims. “The CBI has filled a joint closure report in three different criminal cases registered at different points of time, which is not permissible under the CrPC and is against the settled proposition of law,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2015-sacrilege-cases-sit-rebuts-cbi-closure-report-with-9-point-opinion-101628019575411.html
04-08-2021||Chandigarh||Power politics at play, now Sukhbir vows 400 free units||Six months short of Punjab polls scheduled for 2022, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Tuesday announced a 13-point agenda to be implemented on forming the government, promising 400 units of free electricity to all residential consumers, a discount of ₹10 per litre on diesel for farming and 75% quota in private sector jobs to Punjabi youth. The slew of promises included quota for women in jobs, reservation for government schools students in professional colleges, cheap electricity to the industry and the MSP for fruits and vegetables. “If SAD is voted to power, 400 units of electricity will be given free of cost to residential consumers across all categories and a discount of ₹10 per litre on diesel to tractor owners and farmers,” he announced at a press conference in Chandigarh on Tuesday. He also promised to restore power connections of all the Blue Card-holder families whose supply was disconnected due to default in payment. “Education and health will be the top priority, as was infrastructure development during our previous two terms (2007-17),” he said, claiming that most of the development projects in the state came when his father, Parkash Singh Badal, helmed the government. On Aam Aadmi Party’s 300 units free power promise, Sukhbir said it has little meaning because a single unit over 300 units will make the consumer to pay the entire bill. “We promise 400 units free irrespective of the consumption,” he said. “All Scheduled Caste scholarships will be revived and our government will also ensure free college-level education to them,” Sukhbir said. He also said there was a plan to introduce ‘student card’, offering a loan up to ₹10 lakh for those who want to pursue college/varsity education from abroad, the interest on which will be paid by the government with a payback moratorium of three years. To a query, Sukhbir said on coming to power, the SAD-BSP government will announce a liquor policy to plug loopholes for better revenue collection. He said Centre’s three ‘black laws’ will be “rejected” if the SAD-BSP alliance comes to power. The SAD has stitched a pre-poll alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) under which it will contest 97 seats and rest 20 will go to the Mayawati-led party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/power-politics-at-play-now-sukhbir-vows-400-free-units-101628019458427.html
04-08-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena slams BJP for double-standards on cow slaughter||The Shiv Sena questioned the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Hindutva credentials, calling it anti-Hindu after Meghalaya minister Sanbor Shullai made a remark promoting the consumption of beef. The Sena in an editorial in mouthpiece Saamana said the BJP should apologise to the victims of mob lynching and those booked on suspicions of consuming or transporting beef. Last week, BJP minister Shullai encouraged people to eat beef instead of chicken, mutton or fish. The Sena mouthpiece said BJP’s Hindutva is according to political convenience and called for a uniform policy on consumption of beef. “Shullai has supported eating beef. We will not say hang him or call him a traitor [for his statements]. But BJP should apologise to all those who were lynched to death by mobs and those who were insulted for carrying beef and face cases because a BJP minister has [now] supported beef,” said the editorial. The editorial further said that BJP is a pro-Hindu party but time has come for it to introspect whether its Hindutva is politically convenient. “The mob lynching during Modi’s first tenure was a disgrace to humanity,” remarked the editorial. It further said that in the Northeast, beef is the staple diet and there are no restrictions on the slaughter of cows. “If someone in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi and elsewhere says that cow is gau mata (a sacred animal) but says it’s a useful animal in Goa, Kerala and the Northeast, then it’s hypocritical and shows double-standards. How can the law change as per the state? Uniform Civil Code should be followed in the case of cows,” the editorial demanded.State BJP chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhye declined to comment on the editorial. “We don’t comment on Saamana editorials,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-slams-bjp-for-double-standards-on-cow-slaughter-101628019335892.html

With other Reliance outlets also not being allowed to do business, owners of these commercial properties are blaming farmers for their losses, with no rent being paid to them, in accordance with the terms of their lease contract.“The 275 retail outlets, include 18 supermarkets, 150 smart points or medium-scale retail outlets and a chain of apparel. Farmer associations need to rethink their indefinite dharnas outside Reliance outlets,” said Prabhnoor Singh Walia, who heads an association of building owners, who have rented out their premises to Reliance Industries for operating its businesses across Punjab. The Walmart Best Price Store in Bathinda is also unable to run its business. Sources in both establishments claim scores of retaining company executives, retailers, transporters and porters went out of work, as the agitation hit the entire supply chain and earnings. Employees are being paid salaries regularly since October even as there is no work. The fear of large-scale job losses, however, cannot be ruled out.“Wheat flour, oil, Suji, pulses, packed juices and other range of edible products have crossed its best before use date or have simply rotted away. The company has no access to its outlets. Huge quantities had to be dumped at the waste sites in the last few months, with the help of municipal bodies. No company would pay wages to employees indefinitely when its operations are forced to stop,” said an employee requesting anonymity.Corporate sources say Reliance has over 4,000 employees in its outlets/sources in Punjab, whereas the Walmart Best Price store at Bathinda’s Bhucho has about 300 on-roll workers.“Most of these employees are from Punjab and mainly come from farming families. After Adani Group’s decision to shut its dry port in Ludhiana due to prolonged farmers’ dharna, workers are worried about their future,” said senior officials of both companies on the condition of anonymity.A Reliance Industries spokesperson refused to comment. Walia added Punjabis with investments in the non-agriculture sector also have a right to earn their living and the SKM should honour it.“Farmers protesting against the Centre’s three farm laws are not allowing Reliance stores to operate in Punjab, whereas other corporate retail chains are functional. The farming sector is integral to Punjab, but other sectors cannot be ignored. Farmer unions should understand that it is the Punjabis and Punjab that will lose if the corporate sector chooses to stay away from investing in the state,” he said, adding a delegation will again meet the SKM leadership on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-siege-of-reliance-group-stores-staffers-worried-for-jobs-building-owners-decry-no-rent-payment-101628018977092.html
04-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra cabinet fumes at Governor plan to review meetings||In a fresh round of tussle between the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and Governor BS Koshyari, the ruling coalition has criticised the latter, alleging that he was trying to create two power centres in the state. The state cabinet on Tuesday took objected to the governor’s travel schedule that consists of review meetings in Nanded, Hingoli and Parbhani districts in central Maharashtra districts from Thursday to Saturday. Following the cabinet meeting on Tuesday, chief secretary (CS) Sitaram Kunte went to Raj Bhavan and conveyed the displeasure of the government to the principal secretary to the governor and said the review meetings were “inappropriate”. This is the latest episode in the friction between Koshyari and the Uddhav Thackeray-led government, which assumed office in November 2019. State minority affairs minister Nawab Malik said that since the time the MVA government has come to power, the Raj Bhavan has “interfered” with state government’s business. The government has also raised objection to the governor inaugurating two hostels built by the minority affairs department for Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University in Nanded district. Malik said the department has not handed over the hostel to the university, but the event is being held without intimating the state government. “On August 5, the governor will hold review meetings with Nanded collector and district officials. On August 6, he is heading to Hingoli, where there is no university or any official programme. He is holding review meetings with district collector and officials. Later, he is visiting Parbhani, where the Agricultural University is located, but he is scheduled to hold review meeting with district collector and officials. Is the governor trying to paint a picture that there are two power centres in the state?” Malik asked. The governor is the chancellor of all the universities in the state. Malik added, “If the governor wants any information, he can ask the chief secretary. Instead he’s going to the three districts and holding meetings with government officials. Therefore, the honourable governor is trying to show that there are two power centres.” The minister further said, “The CS has been directed to go to Raj Bhavan and apprise the governor’s secretary that the programme announced are the state government’s rights and it is not appropriate. The CS will meet his [governor’s] secretary today. The state government has expressed displeasure and the cabinet has opposed the governor’s programme,” Malik said. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) minister, in a sharp attack on Koshyari, said that the governor seems to have forgotten that he is not a chief minister (CM) any more. Koshyari was the Uttarakhand CM between October 2001 and March 2002. “He was CM once upon a time. He still thinks that he is a CM, but that isn’t the case. Has he forgotten that he is the governor? We are sure that as the cabinet has objected to his programmes, he will not hold the review meetings. He can carry on with his university event in Nanded as he is the chancellor.” Raj Bhavan did not respond to MVA’s allegations. “The programmes of the governor were planned in consultation with the universities that invited him as chancellor. The hostels at Nanded are already operational and students are staying in them. The governor will visit them. As long as meetings with collectors are concerned, those are just a formality,’ a Raj Bhavan official said, adding, “There is no change in the Governor’s programmes.” The tussle between the MVA government and Koshyari has been going on for over a year now. The tussle between MVA and governor first came to fore when the state cabinet nominated Thackeray’s name to be appointed to the upper house of the legislature – a move that would have safeguarded his chief ministership. However, the governor did not nominate him to the legislative Council. Koshyari also held review meetings with officials on Covid-19 management during the first wave, irking the state government. “This has not happened for the first time. After MVA government came to power, it has been observed that Maharashtra governor has repeatedly impinged in the rights of the government. The governor held a review on the Covid-19 management. The state complained to the Centre after which he stopped,” Malik added. In October 2020 a war of words broke out after Koshyari wrote to Thackeray, and remarked if the CM had turned secular for not deciding on reopening of temples and other places of worship. Thackeray in his response hit back saying he did not need a certificate from Koshyari on Hindutva. Another ongoing tussle is over the appointment of members to the Council. The cabinet has recommended 12 names for nomination to the upper house from governor’s quota. However, despite repeated reminders, Raj Bhavan has not cleared the names. In February, the state government denied permission to the governor to use a state government aircraft for a private trip to Dehradun, triggering a row and inviting sharp criticism from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In July, the MVA had expressed displeasure over Governor’s visit to flood-affected areas in Konkan along with BJP legislators. Reacting to the government’s criticism of Koshyari, Maharashtra BJP chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said that the governor has the right to hold review meetings as all the decisions are made in his name. “He is the constitutional head of the state. All decisions are made in his name. So he has the right to do so [hold reviews]. The government does not want to do any real work and therefore, blame game is an easy choice for them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cabinet-fumes-at-governor-plan-to-review-meetings-101628018975283.html
04-08-2021||Mumbai||After row over transfer, Anchal Goyal to take charge as collector in Maharashtra’s Parbhani||A day after controversy erupted over denying Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer Anchal Goyal from taking charge as Parbhani district collector, the Maharashtra government on Tuesday clarified that her transfer was not cancelled and that she will take charge of the post. District guardian minister Nawab Malik said that Goyal was not allowed to take charge following an objection raised with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray (CM). However, Thackeray accepted Malik’s request to allow her to take charge of the position.Goyal, who was transferred to Parbhani as the collector on July 13, was not allowed to take charge last week. On July 30, the general administration department (GAD) directed incumbent collector Deepak Mugalikar to hand over the charge to additional collector Ajit Patil, forcing Goyal to return to Mumbai. The matter has been seen as a case of political interference.“An objection was raised by an elected representative with the CM over Goyal’s transfer as Parbhani district collector, following which she was asked not to take charge for the time being. Her transfer order was not cancelled. Today, the issue was discussed with the CM. I requested him to allow her to take the responsibility and the CM agreed to it. Goyal will soon be asked to take charge as the district collector,” Malik told reporters after the state cabinet meeting on Tuesday.There were reports that the local Member of Parliament (MP) Sanjay Jadhav from the Shiv Sena made efforts to ensure that Goyal’s transfer order to Parbhani was cancelled. However, Jadhav refuted the charges. “I have nothing to do with her transfer order. I’m simply a public representative. The power of transferring IAS officials lies with the state administration and the chief secretary (Sitaram Kunte),” he told HT on Monday.Malik refused to divulge any name and said he did not know who had raised the objection against Goyal’s appointment. He said it was raised by an elected representative was but clarified that he had never objected to her transfer. “Before leaving for Parbhani, she informed me about going to the district to take charge of the post,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-row-over-transfer-anchal-goyal-to-take-charge-as-collector-in-maharashtra-s-parbhani-101628018675127.html

The employees had earlier announced to observe a two-hour strike by shutting down the entry gates of the bus stand on August 3 and 4. But, entry of buses was allowed after half an hour amid problems being faced by the public due to rainfall. Chaos was witnessed outside the stand, as private operators continued operations and the public faced trouble getting into the buses.  Gurpreet Singh, a passenger, said that the employees should not harass the public during their protest. “Even as the bus stand was opened after half an hour, public had to stand in the open while it rained. A few buses also got delayed,” he said.District president of the union, Shamsher Singh said, “Entry was allowed as passengers were facing difficulties due to rainfall. However, the union will shut down the stand for two hours on Wednesday, as the government has failed to fulfil the promise it made before the last assembly elections to regularise the employees. Also, a three-day strike will be observed from August 9.” Station supervisor Kuljit Singh Sodhi said there was not much impact on the bus services and even though there was some delay, it was covered up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punbus-contract-staffers-halt-services-at-ludhiana-bus-stand-for-30-minutes-101628018561111.html

Saini’s house had been raided on Monday evening, and sources said the vigilance team had taken away documents related to the case. Besides Saini, seven others also face a case under the Prevention of Corruption ActBefore raiding Saini’s house, the vigilance team was ‘almost sure’ about his presence inside the house. A special technical team has been roped in to analyse CCTV footage and check how and when he left the house. In addition to Saini, the vigilance has named Nimratdeep Singh, an executive engineer with the public works department (buildings and construction); Surinderjit Singh Jaspal, Ajay Kaushal, Parduman Singh, Paramjit Singh and Amit Singla in the FIR.In addition to offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act (2018 amendment), Saini and the others have also been booked under Section 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment) and 120 B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC.Saini is the seventh accused in the FIR of disproportionate assets registered against Nimratdeep and others. A senior vigilance officer claimed that during the inquiry pertaining to possession of DA by XEN Nimratdeep Singh, it was found that Saini had transferred a sum of ₹6.4 crore to the father of Nimratdeep from August 2018 to 2020, without any receipt or purpose. When Nimratdeep’s father was called to explain this fact, a fraudulent agreement was prepared projecting that the money was being paid for the purchase of house number 3048, Sector 20-D, Chandigarh, the house where Saini is presently residing.“This is despite the fact that Saini was earlier projected to be a tenant. In this manner, he in pursuance of a criminal conspiracy with Nimratdeep, transferred money in the account of Nimratdeep’s father thereby abetting his undue and illegal enrichment of Nimratdeep beyond known sources of income,” he claimed.Notably, the vigilane Bureau had registered a case against World Wide Immigration Consultancy Services (WWICS) Estates Pvt Ltd, Nimratdeep Singh and Surinderjit Singh Jaspal on September 17 2020, under Sections of IPC and the Prevention of Corruption Act for getting agriculture land, including the area lying in a natural choe, certified as a regular residential colony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vigilance-raid-team-stayed-at-saini-s-home-for-18-hours-takes-away-documents-101628018555138.html

They said that roots of the trees had damaged the retaining wall and there may have been soil erosion due to the rainfall, causing the road to cave-in. On suggestion of the GNDEC experts, MC staff has started removing the wild growth of trees around the wall of the approach road and the process has been initiated to repair the retaining wall.MC executive engineer Rakesh Singla said, “There is vacant space between the retaining wall of the approach road and another boundary wall established along the road in the area which is filled with sand and garbage. Due to wild growth of the trees, the retaining wall got damaged and soil erosion took place. We are also roping in PWD department as they had initially established the approach road in the 1970s.” Bridge open for movement of traffic: The civic body had repaired the damaged road portion using bulk bitumen on Monday night and the road was opened for traffic on Tuesday morning. Singla said that the work to repair the retaining wall is going on and might take around a week to finish.

04-08-2021||Bangalore||Cabinet rejig suspense grows, CM says final list likely today||Almost two days have passed since chief minister Basavaraj Bommai landed in Delhi in a bid to get his cabinet approved from the BJP high command as soon as possible to avoid a repeat of 2019, when it took a long time for BS Yediyurappa to get his council of ministers.After a long wait, Bommai on Tuesday night said that the BJP national leadership has informed to provide a final list of candidates by Wednesday morning post which it will be sent to the Raj Bhavan. “We are trying to get the swearing in done by tomorrow itself,” Bommai said. Talking about the delay, he said there were a few issues on the number of leaders to be included and some differences of opinion on carving out places for deputy chief minister’s. He added that the national leaders will take a final call on it. Bommai also said that Yediyurappa and the BJP’s national president are likely to talk, possibly about the cabinet. The CM said that the cabinet, which will have a mix of experience and new faces, will be formed keeping the 2023 elections in mind and to provide a clean, efficient and pro-people government. Meanwhile. some leaders like BC Patil, who served as the agriculture minister has already announced that he will take oath on Wednesday. The chief minister after his meeting with BJP national president JP Nadda on Monday had said that he is likely to get the candidates list by Tuesday. “I have had a detailed discussion with our national president. With JP Naddaji and have explained the ground situation in the state. They have said that they will have a detailed discussion tomorrow (Tuesday). Since Parliament session is going on, by tomorrow(Tuesday) evening or night they might give us a final cabinet list,” Bommai had said. However, with the national leadership still deliberating on the possible candidates, the state continues to wait for some relief after nearly three years (including HD Kumaraswamy-government) for some semblance of stability from the administration to deliver on much needed governance. Especially, at a time when nearly half the state has been impacted by floods and the imminent third wave of Covid-19 infections rearing its head much earlier than anticipated.Yediyurappa’s cabinet, which was dissolved after the change in leadership, had more to do with rewarding loyalists and turncoats who helped him to power in 2019 over considerations of regional and social representation, analysts said.But the BJP high command, it appears, has taken back control over cabinet formation, leaving the chief minister at the mercy of the national leaders whose decision may or may not undercut the newly sworn in chief minister who already bears the burden of being referred to as a “rubber stamp”.“Basavaraj Bommai has been made chief minister by Yediyurappa himself and his stamp will be there on this government,” Siddaramaiah, the former chief minister and Congress’ leader of the opposition said on Tuesday.The BJP high command had instated three deputy chief ministers in Yediyurappa’s cabinet, however, this time around, analysts and people aware of the developments said that there is a likely chance that there will be at least one more addition in the deputy minister’s post.People aware of the developments said that this time, the Centre is trying to get one member of Vokkaliga, one from backward caste and one each from SC and ST community. They have not ruled out the possibility of culling out another deputy CM post for a member of the Panchamasalis, the biggest sub-sect within the dominant Lingayats, to calm tempers from a community that has demanded better representation, reservation and are nursing a growing feeling of neglect for being overlooked for the chief minister’s post.To be sure, Murugesh Nirani was among the probables to replace Yediyurappa but instead the latter proposed the name of Bommai, who is from the Sadar Lingayat sub-sect.The probability of BY Vijayendra making his entry in the government has been peddled by some quarters, but people closely involved in the decision making process, have dismissed the speculation.“This time there could be a good mix of youngsters and seniors in the cabinet and possibly modelled like the union cabinet reshuffle,” said one senior BJP functionary, requesting anonymity.Analysts said that Yediyurappa has pushed prominent seers of the Lingayat community to add more pressure, as a way to challenge the BJP high command.“Its kind of a dividing line as the traditional support of the BJP is Lingayats. But much of this support was routed through Yediyurappa,” said one Bengaluru-based analyst, requesting not to be named.“He (Yediyurappa) has pitted the mathas against the central leadership,” the analyst added.But which seniors to drop has become the big question as one section have accompanied Bommai, another set is squatting in Yediyurappa’s home and a sizeable number are running around in Delhi on their own trying to impress upon the BJP’s central leadership.The likes of Raju Gouda, Sunil Kumar and Apachu Ranjan among others who identify with the core-ideology of the party are expected to make the list, people aware of the developments said.Though there is still no clarity, several persons have batted for the retaining of the 13 turncoats who helped Yediyurappa to power in 2019.In Yediyurappa’s cabinet, nearly half of 30 districts in the state were without representation, which Bommai is looking to fix this time around.A large reason for this was due to the placating of turncoats who were mostly from the southern Karnataka region, including Bengaluru.“The BJP bought our MLAs by paying them crores of rupees and formed the government and I am not sure what Bommai will do now,” Siddaramaiah said.Bommai on Monday however said that there was no question of the turncoats being treated differently since they are no longer “outsiders”. People aware of the developments said that the first list of ministers will be announced by noon on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/cabinet-rejig-suspense-grows-cm-says-final-list-likely-today-101628018254644.html
04-08-2021||Bangalore||HC notice to BSY, son in corruption case||The Karnataka high court on Tuesday issued notice to former Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa, his son and BJP state vice president BY Vijayendra, family members, former minister ST Somashekar and an IAS officer in a case alleging corruption in a housing project. The single bench of Justice S Sunil Dutt Yadav directed issuing notices to them on a petition filed by an activist TJ Abraham, who challenged the special court’s order on July 8 this year. The special court had dismissed the case for want of sanction to prosecute Yediyurappa and Somashekar. The special court had said that though “there is some material to refer a complaint about the investigation” against Yediyurappa on the allegation of accepting a bribe, it could not order a probe in the absence of sanction for his prosecution as per the law interpreted by the apex court. A communication from petitioner in the case, TJ Abraham on Tuesday, read: “The Hon’ble Court after hearing the counsels representing Social Activist Abraham TJ … has issued Emergent Notice to be served through Hand Summons to the Accused persons namely BS Yediyurappa, Vijayendra, Shashidhar Maradi, Sanjay Sree, Chandrakanth Ramalingam, ST Somashekhar, GC Prakash (IAS), K Ravi and Virupakshappa Yamakanamaradi. And the matter has been directed to be listed for final hearing during the week after next.” The case pertains to allegedly receiving kickbacks from a contractor for a housing project of the Bangalore Development Authority. It was alleged in the complaint filed before the special judge that Yediyurappa and his family members had abused CM’s office and bribes were received by the former CM through his family members from the contractors. The petitioner had accused Yediyurappa of abusing the powers of his office in allotting, speeding, and approving projects and payments. The money thus collected was routed through bogus shell companies to the companies belonging to the family members of the former chief minister, he added.

Of this, 7.5 quintals were confiscated from the godown of a grocery store in Jawahar Nagar camp.In total, five challans of ₹20,000 each were issued against four violators in Jawahar Nagar camp and one in vegetable market.

Over 400 workers have been left jobless by the decision.“Farmer unions should be clear on what they want. They are opposed to the new law and have problems with the previous marketing setup. If they have some idea, then they should discuss it. The line of talk, only after repeal of the laws, is not the way forward,” said Dr Johl. “By forcibly closing stores and other business ventures we are stanching away employment opportunity from our children. This also creates an environment in which investors will be reluctant to enter Punjab,” he added, holding the Centre responsible for failing to explain its stand properly and showing undue haste in enacting the three laws.“Ensuring that farmers get a fair price of their produce should be the sole objective of the government,” he said, “It is sad that no statesman came forward to mediate or made a sincere attempt to help the two sides in resolving their differences.”On a concluding note, he added that instead of politicising the issue, NRIs could play a constructive role in resolving the current impasse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/resolving-centre-farmers-dispute-needs-statesmanship-ss-johl-101628018075410.html

Excerpts: Was the force used by police against the protesters warranted? They were aggressive. They have assaulted policemen and they snatched lathis (batons) from them. If the police had not used force, they would have further escalated the situation. We have to disperse and secure, so we had to use force. One of the representatives of the African community has told the media that, those gathered acted in an unruly manner. That is on record. How many policemen were injured in the attack? Five police personnel have suffered injuries. The CID is probing a case of custodial death. Have you suspended any officer involved in the alleged crime for a fair probe? No one is under suspension. Prima facie there is no reason to place them under suspension. If the CID asks us, we will look into (placing officers under suspension). The policemen involved in the alleged custodial death are continuing to perform duties. They are conducting a crackdown on those protesting the incident. Isn’t this a matter of concern? Prima facie, there is no evidence suggesting any custodial death. From the information we have received so far, we have not come across any evidence of negligence or causing harm to the person (Joel). None of the officers involved in this case (alleged custodial death) are probing the attack on the policemen. Isn’t the death of a 27-year-old due to cardiac arrest, that too in a police station, highly unnatural? People in their 30’s have died due to cardiac arrest. This is not rare. Was there any CCTV footage of the events that took place inside the police station? No. The Supreme Court had made it mandatory to have CCTV cameras in lockups, interrogation cells, and other parts of the police. Isn’t it a violation of the SC order? The Supreme Court orders are yet to be implemented. A committee headed by the regional committee has given an estimate for the undertaking of this project (of installing CCTV cameras) before the relevant authorities. So, in this station, there are no formal arrangements for CCTV cameras in these places. I’m not aware if they have installed cameras in an informal arrangement. Senior officers have said that they are going to check the background of African nationals, was this prompted by the incident?The person who was arrested and subsequently died in custody was caught with drugs in his possession. He was overstaying in the country since 2015. As of now, we have information about more than 600 people overstaying in the state. This verification of documents is a continuous process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-evidence-suggesting-african-s-custodial-death-says-b-luru-police-commissioner-101628018075966.html

There is a small increase in the area under maize crop s compared to last year’s 6,600 hectare.Maize sowing season is almost over and the farmer have grown the crop on just 9,470 hectare against the target of 50,000 hectare set by the government.Officials said the government’s cash incentive scheme for diversification has yielded good results, encouraging farmers to shift from water-guzzler paddy to other crops.“The government had introduced cash incentive schemes for farmers. This is a key factor behind the fall in area under paddy and bajra crop,” said Jagraj Dandi, joint director (statistics), Haryana state agriculture department.On the other hand, farmers are of the view that no or less rainfall during paddy transplant period (June 15 to July 10) is the main reason behind fall in paddy acreage.“I could not transplant paddy on my two acre as there was no rain. I decided to keep my fields empty for vegetable cultivation,” said farmer Madan Lal, of Ratangarh village in Yamunanagar.As per the rainfall reports from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Haryana had received 34% below normal rainfall in the first 11 days (58mm rain) in scattered places against the normal (87.4mm) during this period.Rainfall in June was also 12% below the normal as the state had reported 57.8mm rain from June 1 to July 10 against the normal 86.2mm, stated the figures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/18-decline-in-area-under-paddy-in-haryana-101628017897953.html
04-08-2021||Bangalore||Amid stir over African’s death in custody, police intensify crackdown||Twenty four hours after the death of a Congolese national in police custody, Bengaluru police have begun tracking those who held a protest outside the police station. Police said the protest was illegal and policemen were attacked by the protestors. The death of the 27-year-old Congolese man in police custody has sparked outrage among the African community in the city. The deceased, Joel Shindani Malu, who worked under the alias Jon, according to police, was arrested by the JC Nagar police on Sunday, on the charges of selling banned narcotics. He died in police custody the same night. Even though the staff of the JC Nagar police are under investigation by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), these officers continued to be part of the probe against those who held a protest against the custodial death. Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant said the police have not found any reasons for placing any of the JC Nagar police staff under suspension, so far. “If we get any direction from CID to place any officer under suspension, we will look at it,” he said. According to police, he died due to cardiac arrest while in custody, following which, a protest was held by some members of the African community on Monday morning in front of the police station. This resulted in a scuffle between police and protesters, resulting in policemen and protesters getting injured. “Regarding this incident, there are two cases registered. The first case is as per the complaint by our police sub-inspector Latha and in the second case, some of the African nationals who ran from the police station had pushed a person. Since that person is injured, we have registered a case in this regard as well,” said Dharmender Kumar Meena, deputy commissioner of police, north. One police inspector and two sub-inspectors have been given charge of conducting the investigation. Following the incident, on Tuesday, police have begun a crackdown on African nationals to identify those who are overstaying in Bengaluru. DCP Meena said that police are going through the video recordings of Monday’s protest, to identify those who took part in it. “We will check the documents of everyone who was seen in the video. We will verify how many of them have legal documents with them. Whoever is found without relevant documents will be booked under the Passport Act,” DCP Meena said. The police have conducted urine tests of the five people arrested for the protests on Monday. The urine tests were conducted, as the arrested people refused to provide blood samples. The officers said that out of the five, one person was found to have consumed illegal narcotics. Reacting to the incident, Karnataka chief minister Basvaraj Bommai said that police acted in the right manner. “Drug trafficking has been rampant, and those involved are thus being arrested. They had a violent attitude and therefore, police action was taken. When they needlessly attacked the police, our police took action in the right manner,” Bommai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/amid-stir-over-african-s-death-in-custody-police-intensify-crackdown-101628017894613.html

Last month, AEML discontinued the power supply of about 700 families which had failed to pay the bills from the past two years despite repeated warnings.In the post-disconnection drive, it was found that despite the fact that the meters of these houses had been removed the families continued using direct supply from the main supply, cut out through a cable up to their premises. These residents had used 33,541 units worth ₹4.86 lakh.Commenting on the issue, an AEML spokesperson said, “These consumers were found stealing electricity after disconnection for non-payment of dues. Such consumers put unnecessary tariff burden on consumers who make the payments. Therefore, we will continue with these detection drives and book such offenders.” “Power theft overloads the network. This increases the cost of servicing as cables and transformers are more prone to failures, adding to repair and maintenance costs,” added the spokesperson.The residents however have called it a high-handed move. “We are not in a position to pay [the bills] as many are out of jobs from the past two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic. How can we survive without electricity?” questioned a resident, on the condition of anonymity.Last August, AEML had put on hold their mass power disconnection drive after protests and both the sides reached a compromise wherein the residents agreed to clear the bills. However, 700 residents failed to pay the pending amount, collectively worth ₹2.50 crore. AEML provides electricity to nearly 3,250 customers at Siddharth Colony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/12-mumbai-residents-booked-for-4-86-l-adani-electricity-theft-101628017781663.html

The disease is a contagious viral infection. Another 42 animals are critical, with cows bearing the major burden of the disease, officials of the animal husbandry department say. The affected cattle were among 1.5 lakh animals that the state government had vaccinated under the Centre’s National Animal Disease Control Programme (NADCP) in November 2020. However, the vaccine drive was halted midway after samples of the vaccine failed the quality test. Villagers claimed that at least four animals are dying every day and the death toll has crossed 100. They also alleged that the district animal husbandry department did not include the number of dead calves in its total count of dead animals. The results of samples taken by the department last week confirmed that the deaths were caused by Foot and Mouth Disease. “The results of samples listed negative for heamorrhagic septicaemia, commonly known as ‘Gal-Ghotu’ but they tested positive for FMD,” said an official. A panchayat member Pargat Singh, 32, said, “I have lost four animals, including 3 calves and a buffalo, due to FMD. The animals have been dying since the first week of July and the animal husbandry department had taken it lightly. With senior officials paying us a visit, however, now they are helping us.” Gurveen Kaur, deputy director of the department, said, “The first death due to FMD was reported on July 6 and since then around 35 cattle have died A camp has been set up at the village and our teams are conducting medical examination. Now, there is some improvement in the condition of under treatment animals.” “It is mandatory to vaccinate animals for FMD every six months. The Centre, however, is yet to send the vaccine. For now, the department has procured the vaccine from its own pocket to inoculate the cattle population in Dina Sahib and nearby villages,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/35-milch-cattle-succumb-to-foot-and-mouth-disease-in-moga-village-101628017780482.html

The farmers met Rohtak deputy commissioner Captain Manoj Sheoran a day earlier and asked him to make arrangements to ensure water is drained from their fields.The farmers are up in arms against the administration for its “failure to construct a 100-m drain” which connects the other drain since 2006 and they alleged that the drain was not cleaned before monsoon.Farmer Krishan Kumar, 55, said he had sown paddy on 11 acre and the entire crop got damaged as his fields are in an inundated state for the past one week.“More than 3-ft water is standing in over 300 acre in our village for one week and more water is coming in. We have been requesting the administration to build a 100-m drain which connects the main drain so that water can flow out easily. Due to government apathy, water flows up to 4-ft in our fields every year and we suffer huge losses. The government should provide us compensation,” he added.Another farmer Jaipal said he had sown paddy on five acre and bajra on two acre, but the crops got completely damaged due to waterlogging.“We are already in debt and after our crops get damaged, the debt amount will soar. We have requested local MLA Balraj Kundu but he failed to solve our grievances,” he added.Meham sub-divisional officer Gayatri Ahlawat said the deputy commissioner has conducted a meeting with irrigation department officials and SDMs to look after the situation in fields where water is still standing.“Due to more rain, we have received complaints that drains have overflowed and water entered into fields. We have directed the officials to throw water outside the fields,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/over-300-acre-land-damaged-due-to-waterlogging-in-rohtak-village-farmers-101628017777492.html

The court also found the plea not maintainable.The court also observed that as of the constitutional validity of Section 124-A, the same has already been upheld by a seven-judge bench of the Supreme Court.“The SC decision is final and binding on this court and this court has no power to go beyond the said judgement and examine the validity of the provision which has already been upheld by the SC,” it said, further taking note of the submissions of additional solicitor general Satya Pal Jain that constitutional validity of Section 124A has been challenged in the apex court afresh and matter is pending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-dismisses-haryana-progressive-farmers-union-s-pil-challenging-sedition-law-101628017595223.html

Another FIR also stands registered against him in 2017 for allegedly promoting hatred.He had argued that now challan stands presented. And the apprehension that he was arrested with a great difficulty and there is every chance of him absconding, he is ready to furnish surety of ₹2 lakh each in both the FIRs.The state counsel had said that if enlarged on bail, the farmer would indulge in similar activities and create law and order problem.“While dealing with the petitions for grant of regular bail, this court has no occasion to consider the merits of the allegations in detail. Suffice to say that freedom of speech is a fundamental right and makes a foundation for a strong democracy. At this stage must hasten to add that embargo to freedom of speech is prescribed in Article 19 of the Constitution of India itself,” the court said, dismissing the state’s claims, adding that the nature of contents of the speeches will be subject matter of trial as to whether it was lawful protest against the policies and working of the government or had a different goal and intention.The court, however, said that in case there is a misuse of bail granted to him, the state would always be at liberty to apply for cancellation of the bail order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jind-farmer-gets-bail-on-rs-4-lakh-surety-101628017536898.html

However, the kits will be handed over to the patients if cases rise in the coming weeks.”His counterpart in Yamunanagar, Dr Dilip Mishra (additional charge) contended that the department has received 2,500 kits from the Ambala warehouse. “These will be kept and provided to patients as an immunity booster if a third wave kicks in,” he said.The issue also sparked a controversy as the Indian Medical Association (IMA) had objected to a statement by Patanjali’s co-founder Baba Ramdev on allopathic medicines in treatment of coronavirus. The association had criticized the move by the state calling it “a complete waste of relief funds.”However, Vij had said that they cannot force patients to take this medicine but many believe in Ayurveda and its benefits.Dr Saket Kumar, managing director of Haryana Medical Services Corporation wasn’t available for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/months-on-coronil-kits-yet-to-be-distributed-in-haryana-101628017478318.html

In a letter to Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, Budhu has accused the mayor of corruption, misusing of power in awarding contracts and of promoting illegal construction. “I decided to rake up issue, as corruption is denting the image of Congress in the city of the CM. It is my moral duty to raise voice against such leaders,” alleges the letter. In response, the mayor has said, “Bidhu is a frustrated leader and is levelling baseless charges.” District Congress committee president KK Malhotra and PRTC chairman KK Sharma have come out in Bittu’s support. They claimed that Budhu was indulging in anti-party activities.On Tuesday evening, Budhu issued another press release and said that Malhotra and Sharma had no moral right to demand action against him, as both leaders had worked against party candidate Brahm Mohindra in the 1997 elections. “All these three leaders are surviving in politics by pleasing the members of the royal family.

The order said the Surya was beaten up by the cops and as per the medico-legal report, 13 injuries were found on his body.“The ASI tried to explain these injuries by taking the plea that these injuries were possible due to a fall on the ground, either due to heart attack or due to a fit of epilepsy. The plea cannot be accepted as there is no medical record on file,” the commission said.It said during a departmental inquiry, the ASI was found to be negligent and his complicity in giving third-degree torture to the youngster is established.The commission has asked the chief secretary to ensure that compensation to Surya is disbursed within eight weeks from now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pay-compensation-for-police-torture-hhrc-to-haryana-101628017414946.html

The tests were conducted by department of microbiology, Punjab Agricultural University.As per the reports, Coliform organisms were recorded at 460 at the school and a house in New Chander Nagar, while it was 240 in the sample collected from Rawal’s house and at 150 in the sample collected from the handloom store. E-coli was also detected in all four and the experts termed them as “bacteriologically not safe”. Residents rued that the ground water in the areas around the Buddha Nullah has been badly contaminated due to pollution in the nullah and the failure of authorities in providing potable drinking water is taking a toll on their health.Rawal said, “Cases of cancer and water borne diseases are rising in the areas along the nullah as the ground water is contaminated. Further, deteriorating condition of water supply lines also results in water contamination due to leakage. But, the authorities are not paying heed to the problem, due to which we have sought the intervention of human rights commission. We will also take legal action against the civic body so the MC is charging user charges from us, but it has failed even to provide potable drinking water.” MC superintending engineer Ravinder Garg said, “The MC has not received any report regarding the water samples from the district health department. Also. we are unaware about when and from where these samples were collected as the MC teams were not taken along. I will direct the staff to inspect the area and necessary steps will be taken to provide potable water after receiving the report from the district health department.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/4-water-samples-from-areas-around-buddha-nullah-fail-quality-tests-101628017295945.html

He said 25,826 emergency vehicles dispatches were made to the incident locations to assist people in distress. “Remaining calls were majorly enquiry, blank, appreciation or missed calls,” the ADGP said.The cop said of total actionable calls received at the unified emergency helpline number, 23,924 callers needed police assistance, 2,836 ambulance services and 241 people requested for fire department services.Of all dispatched calls, multi-service dispatches also happened in which the system dispatched multiple services on a single call. This round-the-clock emergency response support system (ERSS) started functioning from the State Emergency Response Centre (SERC) in Panchkula with highly-equipped 601 police emergency response vehicles (ERVs) across state.The SERC has been digitally connected to police control room at district levels and suitably located emergency response vehicles. It is integrated with the mirror centre in Gurugram and the disaster centre in Hyderabad so that the data remains secure at all times.Haryana 112 is an integrated emergency response system, established to provide emergency services to person in distress anytime and anywhere across Haryana.Chawla said initially the response time was on the higher side than expected. A continuous improvement has been observed on the basis of day-to-day monitoring to bring down the response time to 15-20 minutes.He said the average response time has been brought down from about 34 minutes on July 13 to less than 20 minutes on August 2.The ADGP said it is a new and complex system in terms of its multidimensional components and spread across state, so some issues in the system including delay in response, capturing accurate location of the victim, etc occurred in the initial stage.Now, Haryana 112 is improving rapidly by incorporating suggestions and feedback from Haryana residents. Feedback calls are being made to victims within 24 hours after availing the service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-112-emergency-helpline-flooded-with-missed-blank-calls-101628017112787.html

The plea was filed by Haryana Progressive Farmers Union in view of the registration of a case against 100 protesting farmers against three farm laws enacted by the Centre, on July 11.The union had sought the quashing of Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code on the grounds that it was violative of Articles 14, 19(1)(a) and 21 of the Constitution of India.The court found that the persons against whom the FIR has been registered are not the petitioners and that there was nothing on record to indicate that they had authorised the petitioner to act on their behalf. The court also found the plea not maintainable.The court also observed that as of the Constitutional validity of Section 124-A, the same has already been upheld by a seven-judge bench of the Supreme Court. “The Supreme Court decision is final and binding on this court and this court has no power to go beyond the said judgement and examine the validity of the provision which has already been upheld by the Supreme Court,” it said.

Rana is an arch-rival of gangster Jaggu Bhagwanpuria, lodged in Bathinda jail, and faces over a dozen criminal cases. He was outside the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the KD Hospital on Circular Road, when the bullets were fired at him. He was there as his cousin sister is admitted at the hospital.During the firing, Rana’s aide, Tejbir Singh alias Teja, who is a leader of the student wing of the SAD, and a guard of the hospital were also injured. Amritsar police commissioner Dr Sukhchain Singh Gill, who visited the spot along with other senior police officials, said Rana’s condition was critical while Teja and the guard are out of danger. DCP investigation Mukhwinder Singh Bhullar said, “Rana’s cousin sister has been undergoing treatment in the hospital. On Tuesday afternoon, Rana along with his aides went to the hospital. At around 7:20 PM, when he was standing outside the ICU section of the hospital, some unidentified persons came and started indiscriminate firing. Rana received three bullet injuries—each on his shoulder, head and a leg. Teja fired back and in the clash, he has also suffered a bullet injury.”“Rana’s family has alleged that Bhagwanpuria and his men are behind the attack,” he said, adding that Rana, is the prime accused in the Patti gang war that took place in 2016 between Bobby Malhotra and Devinder gangs. Rana’s close associate Sukhwinder Singh alias Lala was shot dead by gangster Saraj Singh, an associate of Bhagwanpuria and was also involved in Amritsar Hindu leader Vipan Sharma’s killing in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gangster-shot-at-outside-icu-of-amritsar-hospital-critical-101628016752255.html
04-08-2021||Chandigarh||IAF to set up vintage airplane museum in Chandigarh||The Chandigarh administration and Indian Air Force (IAF) on Tuesday reached an in principle agreement to create an IAF vintage museum at the government press building in Sector 18.After weeks of deliberations with the administration, which also included visits to the press building, a team of senior IAF officials from Delhi held a meeting with UT administrator VP Singh Badnore on Tuesday, where the final decision was taken to go ahead with the project.“Now, the IAF team will get the requisite internal approvals, and thereafter, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) will be signed with the administration. After the signing of the MoU, we expect the work on the project to be completed within six months,” said UT adviser Dharam Pal.The IAF plans to showcase its vintage aircraft, armaments and memorabilia from different wars, including 1971 Indo-Pak War and Kargil War, at the museum. There will also be a flight simulator at the museum. “Vintage aircraft like Dakota and Spitfire are planned to be exhibited at the museum. There will also be audio video galleries and a space for showcasing documentaries related to the IAF history,” Pal said. The IAF will design the museum, for which it will hire a consultant. “Depending upon the space and design, the number and type of vintage aircraft will be selected by the air force,” said Pal. IAF officials are happy with the space available at the four-storeyed building with glass facade, which is a heritage site. “The IAF officials expect the museum to bring greater awareness in the region, particularly among children, about the role and contribution of the air force in national security and defence,” said a UT official who attended the Tuesday meeting. No takers for vintage car museumThe administration had shut down the government printing press in 2019. It then decided to house a vintage car museum there, a dream project of Badnore. Later, the administration decided to also set up a heritage furniture museum on one of the floors. Another section was planned for organising auction of the spare heritage furniture items.After failing to get any response to tenders floated to invite firms to establish the museum, the administration decided to convert the museum into an IAF vintage museum.“The administration had even reduced the charges in successive tenders but still failed to get any response. The administration has already carried out extensive repairs and facelift of the building. The building located at the prime location on the Madhya Marg has always attracted attention because of its unique architecture. So, a revised proposal was prepared inviting the IAF to create a vintage aircraft museum,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/iaf-to-set-up-vintage-airplane-museum-in-chandigarh-101628016572178.html

The incident took place near a roadside dhaba in Pal Majra village of Ludhiana, the victims told the police. Complainant Neeraj Kumar, who works in the sales department of Sai Ram Agritech, Rampura Phul, Bathinda, said he, along with his two colleagues, were on their way to their company in a Maruti Suzuki Swift car when a Hyundai i10 intercepted them near a dhaba. There were three masked men in the car and one of the accused pointed a gun at the complainant and snatched the cash bag. Before fleeing, the robbers also punctured a tyre of their car with an ice-pick to avoid a chase. The complainant said he informed his employer and the police soon after the robbers left. Samrala station house officer (SHO), inspector Kulwant Singh said the employees of Sai Ram Agritech used to make collections from different districts and deposit it in the office every month. But there is no fixed date for collection, so it is not clear how the robbers found out about the cash in their victims’ possession. The SHO said police are probing if the accused were following the victims. Closed-circuit television cameras in the area are being scanned for more clues. A case of robbery has been registered against unidentified persons at the Samrala police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fertiliser-firm-staffers-robbed-of-rs-15-lakh-at-gunpoint-in-ludhiana-101628016393282.html
04-08-2021||Chandigarh||Prank notice sends Chandigarh Lake Club members into a tizzy||Chandigarh Lake Club found itself in the spotlight on Tuesday after a notice asking its members to follow a bizarre set of rules while visiting the gym and restaurant was shared widely on social media.The club management as well as the Chandigarh administration has claimed it to be a prank, which is being looked into.It all started in the morning as club members visiting the gym found the notice pasted on the information board, asking them to religiously follow some rules to maintain decorum and warned of action against the defaulters. Among other things, the notice talked about wearing a certain approved set of undergarments in the gym that would require a stamp from the authorities. A “smell test” for gym members was also proposed. Another rule mentioned that gym members wearing shorts should have their “legs shaved” or else defaulters would be “depilated” (hair removed) at sight. Another part of the notice read: “Please do not make loud noises while lifting weights.” If this was not enough, there was also a rule that banned the use of foul language except “only permitted bad words” inside the sports complex. While the notice was brought down as soon as members enquired about the bizarre rules, the damage had been done. With its copies shared on social media, netizens had a field day. Tehseen Poonawalla, a businessman and life coach, posed hilarious questions on Twitter: Can members wax instead of shave, who will check the brand of the underwear, what if the member abuses in another language? Another social media user said: “I feel bad for someone who is conducting the smell test.”The club management denied having issued the notice. General manager Naib Singh said: “Monday is a holiday at the club. The management did not put up such a notice. Someone did a mischievous act and put the members in discomfort. We will scan the CCTV footage to identify the culprit and take action.” Singh said all members have been requested not to resort to any such activity in future, while adding that no complaint has been made to police and only internal probe is being conducted.Meanwhile, the Chandigarh administration, under whose jurisdiction the club operates, clarified that the tweet being circulated in the media regarding the notice is “fake and holds no relevance”. The club has over 1,000 members, and offers gymnasium facilities besides sports infrastructure for tennis, archery and swimming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/prank-notice-sends-chandigarh-lake-club-members-into-a-tizzy-101628016392144.html

Have you linked it with their Aadhaar? Is geo-tagging being done to track their locations,” the bench said.The court’s remarks came on a plea by the SDMC, seeking release of money by the Delhi government for paying salaries to its staff.SDMC counsel Divya Prakash Pande told the court that the civic body has biometric attendance system, and added that he will find out if it is attached to the Aadhaar cards of the employees.When Pande told the court that the monthly expenses of SDMC include ₹214 crore for salaries and ₹30 crore for pensions, the court said the civic body was incurring abnormally high expenditure on salaries which is not justified as their core job is sanitation. “You need to see if you are overstaffed and paying salaries…,” the bench said.The SDMC counsel said that they were reviewing if they were overstaffed.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, objected to the SDMC application saying the corporation cannot move two forums for the same remedy as the civic body’s similar plea is also pending before a single judge of the Delhi high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sdmcspending-too-much-on-salaries-says-delhi-high-court-101628016271574.html

A senior government official said deputy chief minister Sisodia, who is looking after environment portfolio as an additional charge in the absence of minister Gopal Rai, accepted the recommendations proposed by the dust management committee. The committee proposed tighter monitoring mechanism for “better environmental compliance and controlling dust emissions from large construction and demolition sites” and said technology-based real-time air quality tracking needs to be implemented and violations would invite heavy fine. “Construction and road dust contributes between 15% and 40% of PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) emissions in Delhi. Tighter monitoring of large construction sites will help us reduce these emissions,” the committee said. Earlier this year, the Delhi government had set up the committee comprising environment experts from Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi, Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), IIT-Delhi, The Energy Resources Institute (TERI), Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) and Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to review international best practices and recommend actions for better management of dust pollution in Delhi. The recommendations included mandatory real-time monitors at all large construction sites, which will be constantly monitored by the DPCC, and if found tampering with the equipment, heavy penalty will be imposed on the site. To that end, the sites will also be required to deposit a predetermined bank guarantee with the DPCC, the recommendations further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-panel-recommends-installation-of-dust-monitors-at-construction-sites-govt-accepts-report-101628016215899.html

The accused, including 55-year-old priest of the crematorium, were booked under sections pertaining to rape, murder and threatening charges, Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the SC/ST Act. They were sent to jail. Though the accused have maintained that the girl died of electrocution while fetching water from an electric cooler, the family have alleged that the suspects hurriedly cremated the body after frightening the family off from informing the police about her death. Demanding death penalty for the four men and speedy justice through a fast-track court, the parents of the girl and nearly 200 people, including local residents, politicians and social activists, are protesting on Pankha road, close to the crematorium.On Tuesday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tagged a Hindi news clip reporting the incident and tweeted, “Dalit ki beti bhi desh ki beti hai (A Dalit’s daughter is also the daughter of the country).” Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said he will meet the family members of the girl on Wednesday. “The murder of a 9-year-old innocent in Delhi after her rape is shameful. There is a need to improve law and order in Delhi. The culprits should be given capital punishment at the earliest. Going to meet the victim’s family tomorrow, will do everything possible to help the family in this fight for justice,” Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi.At the protest, the girl’s mother alleged that the accused locked her inside the crematorium and cremated her daughter’s body without her consent. “They offered me money, asked me to return home and not tell anyone what all happened at the crematorium,” she said.The girl’s father said they will continue to protest until the culprits were hanged. “The priest and the other three men raped and killed my daughter and cremated her body to hide their gruesome crime. We want them to be hanged till death for what they did to our daughter. Till then, we will continue our protest to demand justice for my daughter,” the father said, sitting on a makeshift stage that has been set up in the middle of the Pankha Road.The girl’s mother also alleged that her husband was locked in a room and assaulted by a man named Naresh in the presence of the cops at the Delhi Cantonment police station, late on Sunday night. However, the police refuted the allegations, saying no such assault took place, and added that Naresh is a relative of the couple. They said the girl’s parents were called to the police station for counselling and completing the legal formalities.Among the politicians who visited the protest site on Tuesday were Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad alias Ravan and Aam Aadmi Party’s Mangolpuri legislator Rakhi Birla, who is also the deputy speaker of Delhi assembly.“I have come to meet the family and enquire about the entire incident. It’s a horrible case that cannot be expressed in words. What we saw in Hathras (UP) last year has been repeated in the national capital. Our team of lawyers will fight the case. We will make sure the girl’s family gets speedy justice and a strong message is sent that atrocities on women and children will not be tolerated,” said Azad.The child, who lived with her parents in a rented house near the crematorium, went to fetch water from the water cooler installed at the crematorium around 5.30pm on Sunday. Half an hour later, the priest and the three men called the girl’s mother and showed her the child’s body, the police said.“They told her that the girl was electrocuted to death while having water from the cooler... asked her to not inform the police about the death. They told her that the police will register a case and the body will be sent for an autopsy, during which doctors will remove her vital organs and sell them. The four then cremated the body,” said deputy commissioner of police (south-west) Ingit Pratap Singh.Police said the mother’s statement before a magistrate was recorded on Monday where she did not make the rape and murder allegations. In the evening, her statement before the SC/ST commission was recorded and she accused the four men of raping and killing her daughter and cremating her body.“Initially, the case was registered under culpable homicide not amounting to murder, wrongful confinement and destruction of evidence. After the girl’s mother statement before the SC/ST commission, we added rape, murder and threatening charges under revenant sections of Indian Penal Code and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act in addition to the SC/ST Act. There was no delay in police action,” said joint commissioner of police (New Delhi) Jaspal Singh.The police have identified the accused as Radhey Shyam, the 55-year-old priest of the crematorium, and three employees Salim,55, Laxmi Narayan,49, and Kuldeep,63.Many women protesters, who were carrying placards seeking justice for the girl whom they named Gudiya, demanded that the case be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for further probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dalit-girl-s-alleged-rape-murder-medical-board-to-conduct-autopsy-rahul-and-kejriwal-condemn-incident-101628016212122.html

The Delhi government on Tuesday evening issued an order regulating the movement of goods vehicles in some of the highly congested areas of the city. A gazette notification of this order will be issued on Wednesday after which the restrictions will come into force immediately. The traffic police will act against the violators of the rules. The public works department (PWD) has been directed to install signages at these stretches at the earliest to inform the public about the regulated traffic movement. Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot said the order was in the works for several months now as discussions on identifying the stretches were going on in consultation with the Delhi traffic police.“We hope this will decongest the busy stretches, and also help reduce pollution as Delhi, over the past few years has seen mushrooming growth of small to medium sized goods vehicles. There were no restrictions on their movement. This is the first time that movement of goods vehicles, including the small and medium sized ones, are being regulated in the city at this scale. Such vehicles will have no entry on the specified roads during the given timings,” Gahlot said.

Of the total 2,097,128 Class 10 students across the country whose results have been declared by the CBSE, 200,962 (9.5%) and 57,824 (2.76%) candidates scored 90-95% and above 95% respectively, higher than last year when 184,358 and 41,806 students scored in the same range. CBSE officials attributed the spike to the alternate assessment scheme, under which students were evaluated on the basis of their performances in school level unit tests, mid-terms/half-yearly exams, and the pre-boards, following the cancellation of their final examinations in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.The CBSE had also asked schools to keep their overall pass percentage in line with a reference year -- that is chosen from their best performance in Class 10 final exams in the last three years. “The increase in the overall pass percentage is because schools moderate the marks by +/-2 in accordance with their best percentage in the last three years. So the best of all the schools have together increased the overall pass percentage this year. This ultimately increased the number of top scorers,” said CBSE controller examination Sanyam Bhardwaj.Principal of a government school said that the schools which had been performing averagely benefited by the policy. “Many schools that had scored less in pre-boards later moderated marks in accordance with their reference year performances in final exams. This is how their overall score and number of top scorers increased,” the principal said. Ameeta Wattal, former principal of Springdales School in Pusa Road and chairperson of DLF foundation (schools and scholarship), said, “In the absence of any robust system to evaluate students without examination, this was the best way to evaluate students amid the pandemic. However, this could have huge repercussions later as the children move to senior classes, in terms of understanding and quality of learning. Steps need to be taken to check that. We must immediately start different ways of learning both online and offline and ways to bring children back to schools.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rise-in-top-scorers-in-class-10-exams-cbse-attributes-it-to-alternate-assessment-scheme-101628015985272.html
04-08-2021||Delhi||Privatisation of power helped save Delhi ₹1.2 lakh crore since 2002, say discoms||Ever since electricity distribution was decentralised in Delhi in 2002, the national capital has saved at least ₹1.2 lakh crore, mainly in terms of transmission loss, data shared by the three discoms on Tuesday showed.The Delhi Vidyut Board was disbanded in 2002 and the power sector was privatised because of which aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses have significantly reduced,the discoms said. “Delhi discoms have saved the city and its consumers over ₹1.2 lakh crore over the past 19 years. Of this, the biggest component is AT&C loss reduction, which has saved over ₹95,000 crore. At present, each percentage of AT&C loss reduction saves Delhi consumers around ₹250 crore,” said a BSES discom official, on condition of anonymity. Records show that at the time of privatisation, AT&C losses in the national capital were over 55%. In fact, they were as high as 63% in east and central Delhi. Currently, AT&C losses stand at around 7.5%, a record reduction of around 48%, the discoms further said.“This is followed by investments of around ₹19,000 crore made by the Delhi discoms to improve the distribution network in the national capital. Currently. In the decade before privatisation, the AT&C losses in Delhi had increased by 20%. This, coupled with prolonged outages, was a reason to bring in privatisation. Now if we compare Delhi’s current power distribution system, then the losses in other states will be much higher,” the official quoted above said. However, discoms said since there has been no significant tariff hike in Delhi since 2014, their power purchase costs have increased by over 300% since 2014, as compared to just 91% increase in the retail power tariff during the same period. “The savings by way of AT&C losses have provided a cushion to the Delhi discoms to ensure business continuity despite non cost reflective tariffs over the years. Due to non cost reflective tariffs, revenue gaps (regulatory assets) of the Delhi discoms have crossed the mark of over ₹50,000 crore, to touch ₹51,646 crore as of March 31, 2020,” said an official of discom Tata power-DDL, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/privatisation-of-power-helped-save-delhi-1-2-lakh-crore-since-2002-say-discoms-101628015973757.html
04-08-2021||Delhi||Two held for smuggling liquor through Asola Bhatti sanctuary||The Delhi forest department on Tuesday arrested two men for smuggling crates of liquor from Haryana into Delhi, via the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary, senior officials said.Senior forest officials said the patrolling teams seized 11 boxes with over 200 bottles of country liquor, adding that the accused were booked under the Wildlife (Protection) Act (1972).“The accused were produced before the magistrate on Tuesday. They will be booked under the relevant sections of Wildlife Protection Act,” said Amit Anand, deputy conservator forests (south division).Hindustan Times reported in July how smugglers from unauthorised neighbourhoods near the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary was using the forest routes to bring in large quantities of liquor from Haryana to Delhi. These smugglers have carved out dirt paths through the thick forest to connect illegal liquor vends in Haryana to Sangam Vihar from where it is believed to be further distributed to other localities. Since the rate of liquor in Haryana is lower as compared to Delhi, this is a viable business for many bootleggers in Sangam Vihar area, forest officials said.These incidents started becoming more frequent after the city went into a complete lockdown last year on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, said forest department officials. The smuggling cases spiked again during the second lockdown this year, when liquor shops in the national capital were closed.Range officer Satyendra Prakash said smugglers have been pulling down boundary walls around the sanctuary to gain access to the liquor vends on the Haryana side. “For the past few days, we have been tracking the movement of motorcycles, but they managed to get away. Today during early morning patrolling, our teams finally caught them,” Prakash said.Experts said such movement of people and vehicles in a protected forest area is not only dangerous to the safety of animals but can also have a long-term impact on their movement and foraging patterns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-men-booked-for-smuggling-liquor-through-asola-sanctuary-101628015973292.html
04-08-2021||Delhi||Low-income settlements have limited access to public transport, finds CSE study||Those living in unplanned, low-income settlements in the national capital have “limited access” to affordable public transport, resulting in 1.5 times to 3.5 times increase in their monthly cost of transport, according to a report released by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) on Tuesday. Residents of unplanned neighbourhoods also had to walk longer to access mass transit systems such as the Metro than those in planned neighbourhoods in the same vicinity, the study found.However, even planned residential neighbourhoods, including high-income areas, lacked public transport connectivity, though their situation is better than that in unplanned settlements.The report is based on a ground level assessment of infrastructure for accessibility in 16 residential neighbourhoods of varying economic status such as Tughlaqabad Extension, Govindpuri, Kalkaji, Shahpur Jat, Tughlaqabad village, Greater Kailash, and CR Park, among others. At a time when the government is investing heavily on developing public transport infrastructure and making efforts to promote its use in a bid to curb air pollution, CSE experts said accessibility and connectivity to and from unplanned and planned neighbourhoods have to be improved for substantial gains.As per the report, planned settlements are about 1.3 times better connected than low-income unplanned settlements and have 1.5 times better access to boarding points for buses, Metro etc.As per the Master Plan Delhi 2041 (MPD 2041), the population is estimated to be about 27-30 million by 2041 and it is likely to generate 46.2 million trips daily. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, CSE, said Delhi will “remain locked in the pollution and carb trap” if an 80% share of public transport is not achieved.“This requires immediate improvement in neighbourhood scale accessibility to bus and Metro services and minimisation of interchanges. The expectation of MPD 2041 is that 50% of Delhi’s population will be within the influence zone of mass transit systems by 2041 and mixed-use development will encourage a shift towards public transport. This can be fulfilled only if design and infrastructure improve at the neighbourhood-level for safe and efficient access,” said Roychowdhury.The 16 areas were assessed on parameters such as access to public transport, quality of accessible infrastructure, connectivity between the settlement and rest of the city, accessibility within the settlement etc.And it found that planned settlements are more accessible than unplanned and low-income ones.The report compared journeys from Garhi (low-income unplanned settlement) and East of Kailash (a planned residential areas, located next to Garhi) to the city’s centre.It was found that residents have to walk a longer distance from Garhi — a 27-minute walk— to the Metro station than from East of Kailash, which involved only a 13-minute walk, though both localities are in the same vicinity. The report stated that “on average, walk time of a trip is 1.2–1.8 times in unplanned areas compared to planned areas”. Due to lack of proper connectivity and accessibility to public transport boarding points, those living in unplanned areas end up paying 1.3-3.5 times more on a trip than those from high-income group areas in the same vicinity.As per the report, all neighbourhoods fell short on one key parameter — accessible infrastructure for safe access and connectivity. But it is 1.8 times better in planned areas with high-income group settlements as compared to unplanned neighbourhoods. The streets are 1.7 times more walkable and penetration of intermediate para transit is 1.9 times higher in planned areas than in unplanned areas.Even the general sense of safety is 1.7 times higher in planned areas, finds the study.Roychowdhury said efforts have to be made to improve residential areas’ connectivity and accessibility to public transport services. For that, she said there is a need to frame area-specific and neighbourhood-wise plan for improving accessibility and connectivity.In the 100-page report, CSE has also recommended measures that should be taken to ensure that buses and metro services are accessible by foot or by bicycles, and also pushed for a better feeder (bus) service system. There is also a need to work towards a “citywide development of integrated and affordable public transport service that deeply penetrate and connect neighbourhoods efficiently”, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lowincome-settlements-have-limited-access-to-public-transport-finds-cse-study-101628015734810.html
04-08-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab monsoon mess: Probe ordered after roads turn into rivers in Zirakpur||A week after roads turned into rivers in Zirakpur on the periphery of Chandigarh, the Mohali district administration has initiated a probe into the construction of about 60 illegal colonies in the town. Several housing societies, markets and roads were inundated after barely 30mm of rainfall. In the absence of proper drainage, the town is dependent on choes and nullahs to drain out rainwater. In fact, the Zirakpur residents’ body joint action committee had complained about the illegal colonies to the Punjab chief minister’s office last month, after which an inquiry was ordered. Mohali additional deputy commissioner (general) Komal Mittal, who is conducting the inquiry, said: “I have sought documents pertaining to the illegal colonies from the Zirakpur municipal council and will submit the report in seven days.” Meanwhile, the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has asked the revenue department to stop the registry of 23 more illegal colonies in Zirakpur, Gazipur, Peer Muchalla, and Nagla. Joint action committee president Sukhdev Chaudhary, who is leading the campaign against the illegal colonies, said: “Colonisers are violating many a rule in Zirakpur. Most of them have illegally occupied government land and started construction. MC officials are in the know. So, we lodged a complaint with the CM’s office and finally an inquiry has begun.”Newly appointed Zirakpur MC executive officer Girish Verma assured residents and said, “We will provide all related documents to the ADC and with the help of this report, we will also come to know about the illegal colonies.” The pitfalls of the haphazard construction may have come to the fore last week but it is an old issue plaguing the town for years. In February 2018, then Mohali additional deputy commissioner Charan Dev Singh Mann issued an inspection report in which he cited the connivance of the municipal council officials with builders as the root cause for the mushrooming illegal colonies and violations in projects in Zirakpur. “The situation on the ground is alarming and the safety of buyers and their hard-earned money is at stake,” he said in his report. Unplanned, exponential growth After more than a decade of unplanned development, Zirakpur got a master plan in 2009. But before it could be implemented, the town’s population exploded by 282% between 2001 and 2011. With the population expected to shoot up to 3 lakh by 2021, and 8 lakh by 2030, this urban sprawl stands little chance of orderly development. Harish Gupta, the president of the Zirakpur Builders Association, said even the proposed road-7 (PR-7 or Airport Road) aligned with housing and commercial projects has been approved by the MC but no sewage line or rainwater management has been planned. “Despite charging an extra ₹5 lakh per acre as PR cess from the builders, the department provides no facility,” he said. City of realtors and politicians According to the Punjab local government department, there are 59 illegal colonies within MC limits even though unofficial sources say the numbers are higher. Ironically, most of these were developed after the master plan was notified. Dera Bassi tehsil, of which Zirakpur is a part, has 57 illegal colonies in an area that falls under GMADA’s jurisdiction. Of the 31 members of the Zirakpur MC, 20 councillors from both the Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) are either colonisers or realtors. Local SAD MLA NK Sharma is also in the realty business. Vinay Kumar, the residents’ JAC vice-president, summed up the sentiments of most residents when he said, “We live in a city where elected representatives work for builders, not for residents. The illegal realty development needs to be stopped as the city is fast turning into an urban slum.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-monsoon-mess-probe-ordered-after-roads-turn-into-rivers-in-zirakpur-101628015672272.html

Several other unions and associations supported the protest, including the United Hospitality Association (UHA), of hotel and restaurant owners. Small and big hotel owners, their staff and other people gathered today at Good Luck Chowk and protested against the decision. “For the last two years we are hardly doing any business and now when the Covid cases have gone down we should be given some more relaxations. We follow all the Covid guidelines and rules very strictly, for our own and customers’ safety. Despite that there is no timing extension or relaxations given to Pune city. The current timings are not suitable for anyone, neither for us and nor for public. Who will come to have lunch or dinner between 7am and 4 pm,” said Sandeep Narang president of the association. Another member, Rahul Ramaswamy Ramnath, owner of Cafe CO2 at Bhugaon said, “People come to relax at the hotel. Due to this pressure and depression of not having business, till now, four hotel owners have died by suicide in the state. From 3,500 small and big hotels and restaurants 50 per cent have closed down in the last 1.5 years.

04-08-2021||Other||Cannot consider Pune city in isolation: state task force||PUNE As Pune city residents expressed frustration over the state government not providing any relaxations with regards to opening up more facilities or extending shop timings in the city, the state Covid-19 task force, which acts as an advisory body to the state government, has said that the districts of concern continue to remain under previous restrictions. These 11 districts, as an administrative unit, have continued to report a positivity rate of more than 5% in the last two weeks. While Pune city’s combined positivity rate has been below state average, the city’s RTPCR positivity is yet to come below 5% consistently for two weeks. Public representatives and citizens have been demanding special regulations for Pune city as a separate entity, and considering the positivity rate of the city. Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol even announced that he would support the business class which has been most affected due to the lockdown and said that the city’s reducing positivity rate must be considered, and not the district’s as a whole. However, the state task force has said that even though the city is performing well in terms of reducing cases and positivity rate, it cannot be considered in isolation. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state’s Covid-19 task force, said, “When we advised the CMO regarding relaxations we recommended it based on three factors mainly for all the districts; one, a RTPCR positivity of lower than 5% constantly for two weeks, every single day; two, over 70% fully vaccinated population which is not likely as of now and three, strict adherence to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour which is in the hands of the public. The districts of concern have had a RTPCR positivity rate of more than 5% in the last two weeks. I cannot say specifically talk about Pune, but this is the yardstick we applied. Also another factor is the R naught value which may be higher in these districts. If there are a lot of RAT tests being conducted then it is not a representative sample and so we have to separate the RTPCR positivity rate.”Joshi added, “All cities ultimately have to take certain precautions when they open up, especially large metros which are densely populated and see large migration. These are zero crowding, zero unmasking situations in public space and to maintain some Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, try to maintain vaccination and if somebody has symptoms so self-test and self-isolate so that the spread is prevented.” Joshi also pointed out that even though the city has reported a lower positivity rate than the rural areas, the movement of people from rural to urban cannot be restricted and so the urban areas are still at risk of higher infection. AMC Ravindra Bhinwade said, “It is a good thing that Pune city is recording a lower RTPCR positivity rate. In the past two weeks alone, Pune city has reported an RTPCR positivity rate of less than 5% except on 18th which was a Sunday. However as Pune continues to remain under ongoing restrictions as per state government orders we will continue to implement them.” Dr Subhash Salunkhe, state Covid-19 advisor said, “We cannot consider Pune city or even PCMC as a separate entity epidemiologically, although it is true that the city has seen a fall in the number of new cases and the positivity rate has gone down. However, the peri-urban areas surrounding Pune city are quite a large number and are still reporting a higher number of Covid-19 cases. “We did indicate that the shops could be kept open for a slightly longer period, however, opening of restaurants, especially AC restaurants, is absolutely not recommended. Only restaurants with proper ventilation were recommended to be kept open. The positivity in rural areas is still higher than the state average I will sound a similar warning bell for Mumbai as the relaxation come with a great risk. Surveillance of indicators involving private hospitals should be monitored, including that of waterborne or monsoon-related illnesses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cannot-consider-pune-city-in-isolation-state-task-force-101628015555622.html
04-08-2021||Pune||Politicians unhappy with Maharashtra govt's decision on Covid-19 norms for Pune||Even as the positivity rate in the city has been declining and is under the state’s average for the last few weeks, the state government’s decision to not offer any relief to Pune from the existing curbs is now being questioned on many levels.For the duration of July 15–21, the average positivity rate in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits was 3.9%, while it came down to 3.4% during July 22-28, and further dropped to 3.23% for July 29-August 2, making the city fit into the criterion announced by health minister Rajesh Tope last week. Tope said those areas with an average positivity rate less than that of the state will be offered relaxations.Under Pune district, the state government’s previous order clearly mentions that Pune city, Pimpri-Chinchwad and the rural parts be considered as three separate units. City-based traders said the Shiv Sena is ill-treating the city given that another party is in power at civic body here.Muralidhar Mohol, Pune mayor, questioned the mechanism of deciding which parts be granted relief.“Since a month, the positivity rate in Pune city is below 5%. State government had said that if the positivity rate remains below 5%, then curbs can be eased. In the weekly Covid review meeting I demanded several times that Pune should get relaxations. Traders and people are demanding the same. Guardian minister said that we are positive about it, but on other hand health minister said different things and CM took a different decision.”Pune city, according to Mohol, is fulfilling the criteria of relaxations set by the state government. “If these criteria are applied, then Pune belongs to level 2. It is important to give relaxations to Pune and the state government should rethink its decision.”According to data by the district administration, the oxygen bed occupancy in PMC is 7.86%. As per the earlier five-level unlock plan declared by the state government, a positivity rate below 5% and oxygen occupancy percentage below 10% allows more relaxations from Covid-induced curbs. After the level 3 restrictions were made a baseline for restrictions in the state, no official mechanism of unlocking was declared, but the health minister had mentioned that districts below the state average on various Covid indicators would get some relaxations.As the positivity rate in PMC has dropped a demand has been made to ease the level 3 curbs in Pune city, but no clear answer has been given by the state administration in this regard.Maharashtra cabinet minister for minority affairs Nawab Malik clarified that no special treatment has been given to Mumbai, saying the decision was taken as the positivity rate in Mumbai dropped to 1%. Malik asserted that if the positivity rate in Pune and the other 10 districts drop then relaxations would also be given to these areas. It has raised the question of whether the state government has secretly changed the criteria of relaxations.“In Maharashtra, there are 11 districts where positivity rate is above 5%. According Central government’s guidelines in order to contain the spread in such areas some restrictions have to be in place. In Mumbai, the positivity rate has dropped to 1%. So relaxations have been given in Mumbai. Shops are now allowed to remain open till 10 pm. If the positivity rate falls further in Pune and 10 other districts and situation comes under control then Covid curbs would be eased there too,” said Malik.Prashant Jagtap, NCP city unit chief said, the daily caseload in Pune city has decreased in the last 15 days. “As NCP members, we will request guardian minister Ajit Pawar to give some relaxations to Pune city. Undoubtedly the collective Covid numbers from the district is high, but Pune city has been recording fewer cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/politicians-unhappy-with-mva-decision-on-covid-norms-for-pune-101628015555002.html

Ayush is a specialised stream of practice in ayurvedic, unani and homeopathic ways of treatment which is also referred to as the Indian system of medicine. The ISM delegation raised several issues. The most important issues were regarding the subsidy for electricity in their clinics, the introduction of Ayush in mohalla clinics, and relief from ₹890 fees levied on biomedical waste collection.from Ayush clinics. The doctors submitted that the Ayush clinics were small and didn’t produce biomedical waste. Thus, the fee should be waived off or reduced. Jain immediately responded to this submission and gave directions to the designated departments to put this into effect,” said Jain’s office in a statement issued on Tuesday.Jain further said, “Mohalla clinics should be selected around Delhi to accommodate and introduce Ayush treatment which will serve the dual purpose of providing welfare to the Ayush doctors as well as people.”He soon issued direction to the health department to identify few mohalla clinics for Ayush treatments, the government said.Jain also emphasised the importance of Ayush in the overall health infrastructure of Delhi, especially during the Covid times. “Ayush will play a crucial role in the post-Covid-19 recovery of patients through its natural ways of boosting immunity and giving treatment with minimum use of medicines.

The restriction to end operation by 4 pm between Monday and Friday was retained for all shops in Pune district, inviting protests from traders, industries and restaurants in the city. “Covid cases have gone down in Pune city and yet shop timings continue to be up to 4pm. To oppose this biased decision by the state government, all our association members and traders across the city protested today while planning to keep the shops open till 7 pm from tomorrow,” said Fatechand Ranka, president of Federation of Trade Association of Pune (FTAP). Pune city’s positivity rate for the week ending August 1 has been 3.3%, which is less than average positivity rate of Maharashtra. The business community wants Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad municipal limits and rural parts of districts to be assessed as separate administrative units to decide their grade of relaxation citing lower Covid positivity rates. Maharashtra government on Monday left out 11 districts including Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara, Pune, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Solapur, Ahmednagar, Beed, Raigad, and Palghar from the ambit of relaxations citing their high Covid-19 caseload. Maharashtra recorded 4,869 fresh cases on Monday, taking its tally to 6,315,063 including 75,303 active cases. The association says it has reasons to allege bias claiming the new relaxations allow all essential and non-essential shops to remain open till 10 pm in Mumbai and 8 pm in other districts. They say that while the state government allowed the civic bodies to take the final call on easing of restrictions in Mumbai city, suburban areas and Thane, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad were denied any relief. At around 11.45 am several traders gathered near Sonya Maruti Chowk on Laxmi Road in Pune city before marching towards Alka Talkies Chowk while beating kitchen utensils and Bells. Similarly, other shop owners, traders and their local unions across the city protested in front of their shops. Ranka accused Uddhav Thackeray government of “favouring” Mumbai since the Shiv Sena controls the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). “Shiv Sena government has given relaxations to Mumbai just because it is in power in the BMC. But in Pune, another political party is in power so they are not giving any relaxations to Pune. We have decided to keep our shops open from tomorrow up to 7 pm and [are] ready to face any action taken by the police or government authorities,” said Ranka, referring to the fact that the Bharatiya Janata Party runs the Pune corporation. When asked about allegations by traders Maharashtra minister for minority affairs Nawab Malik said in Mumbai that government decided to relax curbs in Mumbai because positivitu rate there was less than 1%. “Tomorrow if Pune’s cases come down, government will immediately ease restrictions,” said Malik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pune-traders-allege-bias-firm-on-violating-deadline-from-aug-4-101628015553890.html

The report said that the hospital was right in raising the alarm about the shortage of oxygen in wider public interest and the other admitted patients.The report further said the hospital did not receive oxygen supply for almost 30 hours — from 5.30pm on April 22 to 11.45pm on April 23.“On scrutiny of death summaries of all deceased persons, it revealed that no death of patient was caused due to shortage of oxygen,” Tayal said.The police also told the court that the hospital authorities were not in a position to comment on or refute the preliminary conclusions drawn by a Delhi government committee, that also probed the deaths.The family members of the dead patients have demanded a CBI probe and said that the cause of the death of the deceased has been mentioned as respiratory failure by the doctors for the reason that proper oxygen supply was not given to the patients on time.On Tuesday, the court was told that on the date of the incident, the hospital was starved of oxygen and it is a matter of record that M/s Inox, the gas supplier, supplied 3.8 MT on April 24 at 5:30 pm.“Resultantly, when this situation ensued, there appeared to be a linkage between the unusually high number of deaths and deficient oxygen supply,” the hospital added.The court will now hear the matter on October 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-deaths-due-to-oxygen-shortage-at-jaipur-golden-delhi-police-tells-court-101628015552722.html

We do not think that there is any legal problem in calling for suggestions and objections. The administrative process of compiling suggestions and objections to the DP will take almost a year after which the same will be scrutinised before being sent to the metropolitan committee for approval.”Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) filed a writ petition and challenged the metropolitan committee of the PMRDA. Ganesh Bidkar, BJP leader of the house in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said, “It’s a victory for the BJP. As the state government was suppressing the municipal corporation’s right, the High Court has ruled against the state government.”“As the High Court has stayed the metropolitan committee, the PMRDA will not be able to call for suggestions and objections or even carry out further work on the DP,” Bidkar said.Attacking the Shiv Sena, Bidkar said, “Sena leaders Sanjay Raut and Tanaji Sawant are not from Pune. Then too, the chief minister appointed them here. They might have purchased land in the PMRDA area which is why they were appointed to the PMRDA. While appointing outsiders however, the state government did not appoint member of parliament (MP) Girish Bapat or any BJP member of legislative assembly (MLA) from the city. The state did not even appoint the mayors from Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad on the metropolitan planning committee.”When contacted, metropolitan commissioner Suhas Diwase however said, “We are waiting for a written order to get further clarity. It is early to make any comment on the issue.”The issue in question:While the metropolitan committee of the PMRDA has the right to approve the development plan (DP), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been kept away from the planning committee of the PMRDA by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). Rather than appoint an elected BJP member, the MVA appointed Sanjay Raut and former minister Tanaji Sawant – both of whom are not from Pune - to the committee. With Pune MP Girish Bapat, Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol, PCMC mayor and other BJP MLAs not on the committee, the BJP alleged that the MVA is playing politics.“The BJP is ruling in both Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal corporations. Ideally, mayors or standing committee chairmen should be nominated members. The ruling party has avoided MP Girish Bapat and other BJP MLAs altogether,” according to the BJP.Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it was not possible to hold elections for the planning committee. The planning committee consists of 30 members. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it was not possible to hold elections. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is the PMRDA committee president.The Maharashtra government has appointed MP Supriya Sule, MP Sanjay Raut, MP Shrirang Barne, MLA Tanaji Sawant, Sangram Thopate, Sunil Shelke and Sanjay Jagtap as committee members while the rest of them are government officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/hc-stays-pmrda-planning-committee-dp-work-will-not-be-affected-says-pmrda-101628015493894.html

The passing percentage this year in Pune is been higher by 10% over 2020, when 89.45% students cleared their HSC. This means top colleges in the city and the rest of the division are likely to have higher cut-offs for admissions for admission to graduate courses, which will lead to more competition among students looking for admissions to graduate courses like BA, BCom and BSc. Ravindrasinh Pardeshi, principal, Fergusson College, said that the cut-off may increase this year, but it will be only marginal. “Because of good results this time, it is likely that marginally the cut-offs may increase. But, they will not be too high,” said Pardeshi. He also added that if the university permits, top colleges can increase the capacity by 10 per cent, depending on infrastructure and other factors. Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal of Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce, Shivajinagar, said that prominent colleges will witness a higher cut-off this year, as many students have scored good marks. “There is likely to be higher competition this time for courses like Bachelor of Science. One lakh students have not registered this time for the Common Entrance Test (CET) for entrance to Engineering courses, as compared to last year. These students may seek admission for BSc, Bachelor of Arts and Commerce courses. Hence, if the university permits, big colleges can increase the capacity by 10 to 20 per cent,” said Zunjarrao. Speaking about Pune division’s results, Dinkar Patil, chairman, Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE), said that in Pune division, 231,331 students appeared for Class 12 . “Around 99.75 per cent of students in the division have passed Class 12 . Of these, 99.66 per cent male students passed and 99.77 per cent females passed,” said Patil. He further added that the pass percentage for commerce this year is higher than arts and science. “Commerce has a pass percentage of 99.91% in the division, whereas Arts is 99.75% and Science is 99.73%,” said Patil. Repeater candidates in the division also scored well this time. “Pass percentage for repeater candidates is 98.91 per cent this year. Whereas in 2020, only 34.08 per cent repeater candidates passed,” said Patil. He refused to share data about how many students scored 100 per cent marks in the Pune division. “There should be a demarcation regarding which division has a higher number of students with 100 per cent marks and 35 per cent marks. Hence, that data will not be shared by the board,” said Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hsc-pass-percentage-pune-division-records-99-75-cut-offs-for-admissions-to-undergrad-courses-to-increase-101628015492748.html

At 99.04%, almost all regular students whose results have been released passed the CBSE Class 10 this year through the revised criteria and became the first-ever batch to pass without taking board exams. According to the alternative assessment policy’s formula, the theory marks of each subject have been computed on the basis of internal exams conducted by the schools throughout the year. In the assessment policy, 10 marks were allotted on the basis of students’ performance in the unit or periodic tests, 30 marks on the basis of their performance in mid-term or half-yearly examinations, and 40 marks on the basis of their score in the pre-board examinations. Most schools conducted these exams in the online mode.These marks were then added to the actual marks scored by the students in internal and practical exams conducted by the schools for the subject either in online or offline mode.Every school was asked to constitute a result committee consisting of eight members, including the principal, five subject teachers and two external members. To ensure that the results are prepared on time, CBSE trained school staff on the assessment policy.“An online webinar was conducted to explain the tabulation policy. This webinar was viewed by more than 90,000 teachers. This was a live program on YouTube wherein after explaining the policy, queries of the schools were also resolved by the CBSE. Queries received on email, WhatsApp and on phone were converted into frequently asked questions (FAQs), uploaded on websites and sent to all the schools,” CBSE controller examination Sanyam Bhardwaj said in a statement on Tuesday.The schools were asked to keep their overall pass percentage in consonance with a reference year which could be chosen from among the institute’s best performance in CBSE Class 10 exams in the last three years.The board had also said that the overall average marks for the schools for 2021 should not exceed the overall average marks obtained by it in the reference year.The schools were also allowed to moderate marks by +/-2 from their reference year and to check inflation of marks by schools, the CBSE launched a portal to submit the marks. “The portal was tuned with the reference year and the mean marks. It only accepted scores in accordance with it. This portal helped schools to upload marks in a time-bound manner,” Bhardwaj said.Meanwhile, the board has also clarified that in case any candidate is not satisfied with the marks allocated, they will be given an opportunity to appear in an exam as and when the conditions are conducive to hold the examinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/class-10-results-how-cbse-evaluated-students-this-year-101628015433256.html

When people in the area argued and manhandled the authority officials, the police was called in, they said.“Police personnel were sent to deal with the situation. When the head constable tried to intervene and sort the matter out, one man assaulted him with a knife and then fled the area,” said deputy commissioner of police (Zone 1) Rajesh S. “We have identified at least two involved in the incident and efforts are on to nab them. There are no CCTV cameras at the spot but three teams are working on tracing them. We will register a case against them for assault and take necessary action.”A Noida Authority official said that it was a routine drive to remove vendors who had set up shop on public land on the roadside.“The officials asked them to move to the authorised vending zones to conduct their business. When they misbehaved with the staff, the police were called in,” said the official.In a separate incident, police said that a video on social media of a biryani seller’s vend allegedly being overturned by a policeman in Surajpur was fake.“It was found that the seller himself had overturned the stall to tarnish the image of the police who had asked them move from public spots that caused congestion. We also have CCTV footage that showed this. The vendor and his brother themselves did this and shared the video on social media.

04-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi Cabinet nod to salary hike for MLA's||The Delhi cabinet on Tuesday approved salary hikes for legislators in accordance with the Centre’s proposal, the government said in a press statement.The statement, issued after a meeting of the cabinet chaired by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, said, “Delhi Cabinet approves salary hike for MLAs as per Centre’s proposal. Delhi MLAs will only get a salary of ₹30,000. CM Arvind Kejriwal-led Cabinet approves Centre’s proposed salary for MLAs. Delhi’s MLAs will continue to be among the lowest-paid MLAs across India.”It said, “Even as the cost of living in Delhi has risen substantially, the restriction imposed by the Centre has forced Delhi’s MLAs to be amongst the lowest earning MLAs in the country whereas MLAs of states ruled by the BJP and the Congress earn around 1.5 to 2 times the amount that the MLAs of Delhi will earn. The salary of Delhi’s MLAs hasn’t increased since 2011 and the Delhi government had requested the MHA that the salary of Delhi’s MLAs be at par with MLAs of other states. The basic salary was requested to be set at ₹54,000. However, the MHA refused to do so.”According to a break-up shared by the government, the total monthly salary of ₹90,000 comprises ₹30,000 basic salary, ₹25,000 constituency allowance, ₹15,000 secretariat allowance, and ₹10,000 each for telephone and conveyance.The break-up, however, does not mention several additional salary elements such as allowance for attending assembly sessions, committee meetings, medical facilities, pension, electricity and water reimbursements, annual travelling reimbursements and reimbursement for data entry operators, said a senior official who did not wish to be named.The increase approved by MHA is likely to open up a new front in hostilities between the Centre and Delhi’s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government.“The Delhi Cabinet today approved the Salaries and Allowances of Ministers of Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi, (Amendment) Bill 2021 and MLAs/Speaker-Dy Speaker/Chief Whip/Leader of Opposition of Legislative Assembly of Delhi (Amendment) Bills 2021. After Cabinet approval, the proposal and draft bills will be sent for MHA’s approval before being placed in Delhi Assembly,” the statement said.The raise, the first since 2011, will mean Delhi’s lawmakers remain among the lowest paid in the country.As per the data shared by the Delhi goverment, in Uttar Pradesh, a legislator’s monthly salary and allowances add up to ₹95,000 a month; in Gujarat, ₹105,000; in Bihar, ₹130,000; in Rajasthan, ₹142,500; in Haryana, ₹,55,000; and in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, ₹198,000 and ₹190,000 respectively. Telangana pays its lawmakers ₹250,000 a month.Leader of the Opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said that the AAP government has failed to provide basic facilities to legislators.Bidhuri, a BJP legislator who represents the Badarpur assembly constituency, said: “The Delhi government has failed to provide furnished offices to MLAs, vehicles and basic facilities. I have written to the CM’s office and Speaker in this regard. The Delhi government does not need the central government’s approval for such things. Now, they are trying to blame the central government regarding the current increase in MLA’s salaries even though that is adequate in the light of the pandemic and its financial implications. This is the time to talk about preparations against a potential third wave of Covid-19 and not issues such as salaries of MLAs which does not directly affect the public. The AAP government should stop looking for excuses to hide their failures on the fronts of public transport, health infrastructure, water supply, etc.”In the 70-member House, the AAP has 62 members, and the BJP has eight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cabinet-okays-mlas-salary-hike-as-per-centre-s-proposal-101627979670480.html

The sectors for development include public infrastructure, transport network, solid waste management and fighting air pollution.The initiative has been named “Delhi@2047”, which is in line with the Aam Aadmi Party’s vision document incorporated in the state budget 2021-22.“Delhi has to be turned into a global city. We have to prepare a road map regarding our vision on how we see Delhi in 2047 – with the country completing 100 years of Independence. When we say 2047, we are not procrastinating. We are developing strategies. We have to set both short-term and long-term goals. Long term goals include increasing Delhi’s per-capita income to match that of Singapore, bidding to host Olympic Games. Goals such as 24x7 supply of water across the city have to be accomplished immediately,” said Kejriwal, addressing a video conference involving policy makers and corporate stakeholders, which was live-streamed.Kejriwal said, “In the last five years, several sectors in Delhi, such as education, health, power and public services, have witnessed good growth and improvement... Several sectors need more work in the days to come, such as Delhi’s roads, water supply, public transport system, development of lakes, sports infrastructure, solid waste management and fighting air pollution. It is not rocket science. Cleaning Delhi actually can be turned into a revenue generating idea... For doing such works, we need cooperation of residents, the corporate sector and all other sectors.”While tabling the budget in the Delhi assembly on March 9, finance minister Manish Sisodia said Delhi’s population is likely to reach 32.8 million by 2047.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cm-kejriwal-launches-initiative-to-make-delhi-global-city-by-2047-101627978410462.html

The new rollout will include 1.4 million teenagers across the UK.“In the last few weeks, there have been large changes in the way Covid-19 has been spreading in the UK, particularly in younger age groups. The adult vaccine programme has progressed very successfully and more safety data has become available, so it was important to review the advice for the vaccination of children and young people,” a statement issued by Public health England said on Wednesday. It added that young people will get 80% protection against hospitalisations, after being inoculated with the first vaccine dose.Health experts have welcomed the decision by saying it is an important step for protecting the young and reducing the transmission of Covid-19Accepting the JCVI’s recommendation on vaccinating young people aged 16 and above, health secretary Sajid Javid said on Wednesday that he has instructed the National Health Service (NHS) to prepare to vaccinate those eligible at the earliest.However, the vaccination committee has not yet recommended administering doses to children below 16 years. “JCVI will continue to review data and provide updates on at-risk groups aged 12-15 and whether any additional groups will be added,” Sajid said in a statement. At present, the UK has only approved vaccination of children above 12 years only with an underlying health condition or who live with a vulnerable person.Other countries in Europe, including France and Germany, and also the United States have already approved inoculations for children above 12 years.As of Wednesday, authorities in the UK have vaccinated 85,661,367 beneficiaries so far of which nearly 47 million have received the first dose and the remaining 38,733,334 are fully vaccinated, according to the bulletin shared by the Department of Health and Social Care.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukto-administer-covid-19-vaccines-to-healthy-16-and-17yearolds-101628097596947.html

It was also his first visit to Tibet as President.Opened on June 25, the 435-kilometre-long railway line has a designed speed of 160 km per hour. It reduces the travel time from Lhasa to Nyingchi from 5 hours to approximately 3.5 hours.China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of South Tibet, which is firmly rejected by India. The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC).

They will not need the consent of parents.The change, which means another 1.4 million people across the UK will be eligible for a first dose of vaccine, comes just two weeks after the JCVI recommended against routine vaccination of anyone under the age of 18 though did stress that it would continually assess the evidence.Currently, the only 16 and 17-year-olds being offered the Pfizer vaccine, which has been approved by Britain’s medical regulator for use for anyone aged 12 and over, are those with underlying health conditions or those living with vulnerable people.The timeline for when they will get their second dose has yet to be determined but further recommendations based on the evidence of how the response to the first dose has been will emerge in coming weeks.“While COVID-19 is typically mild or asymptomatic in most young people, it can be very unpleasant for some and for this particular age group, we expect one dose of the vaccine to provide good protection against severe illness and hospitalization,” said Professor Wei Shen Lim, who chairs the JCVI's Covid-19 program.While the British rollout of vaccines has been one of the world’s fastest, with 73% of the adult population fully vaccinated, it has been fairly tardy in offering jabs to youths. There have been growing calls for the vaccination drive to be expanded following a spike in infections this summer as a result of the spread of the more transmissible delta variant and the lifting of lockdown restrictions.Despite Wednesday’s change, the UK still lags many other European countries such as France and Germany, which are offering vaccines to children aged 12 and over.The JCVI said it will continue to keep its position under review on vaccinating under-16s without underlying health conditions or those not living with people who are immunocompromised.Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, England’s deputy chief medical officer, said there was “no time to waste" and that he expects the rollout to start in “a very short number of weeks."Schools across the UK are closed for the summer holidays, with most reopening in early September. However, students are set to return to schools in Scotland in the next couple of weeks.Wei Shen Lim, the JCVI's chair, said there had been feedback from young people who want to have the choice to get a coronavirus vaccine.“So, they’d like to be offered the vaccine, understand the risks and potential benefits, and therefore make a choice for themselves whether they want to have it or not," he said.The expanded rollout comes amid evidence that the vaccination drive among younger adults has slowed down in recent weeks, a trend that's prompted the British government to offer incentives, such as discounts and even free slices of pizza to persuade young people to roll up their sleeves and get the shot.There are many younger people who have opted against getting a jab because the evidence is clear that they are much less likely to get anything more than mild symptoms of Covid-19.“I would just urge all families thinking about this across the country to listen to the JCVI," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said while on a visit to Scotland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-rollout-covid-19-vaccines-for-adolescents-aged-16-17-101628094318261.html

The groom was among the 12 persons injured."Several lightning bolts within few seconds hit the boat carrying the wedding party revellers, killing 16 of them instantly," Chief Administrative Officer Sakib Al Rabby told reporters at Shibganj.The bride was not with the wedding party, he said.Rabby said the mishap took place as the revellers were disembarking from the boat one by one to take refuge at a shelter due to sudden monsoon rains that brought with it the unexpected thunderbolts.The bridegroom survived the disaster, but he was injured along with 11 others, the officer said, adding that the wounded are being treated at a government hospital with burn wounds.Lightning strikes, especially in monsoon season, kill hundreds of people every year in Bangladesh. The country in 2016 declared lightning strikes a natural disaster, though many thunderstorm deaths are never officially recorded.In 2016, over 200 people, including 82 on a single day, died in the month of May alone due to lightning strikes. Most of them were farmers and died while working in their fields.Experts attribute the rise in fatal lightning strikes to deforestation. According to them tall trees would have drawn lightning strikes.The monsoon rains in recent weeks have ravaged southeastern Cox's Bazar, leaving 20 people dead, including six Rohingya refugees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/16-killed-as-lightning-strikes-wedding-party-in-bangladesh-101628094545869.html

WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus highlighted the vaccine disparity as rich countries are moving swiftly to plan booster doses for their citizens.Tedros told a press briefing that 80% of the vaccine doses administered globally have gone to high- and upper-middle-income countries, while low- and lower-middle-income countries are struggling to vaccinate even their healthcare workers and high-risk groups. He stressed that hundreds of millions of unvaccinated people require Covid-19 vaccines urgently as they cannot afford to stay home."I understand the concern of all governments to protect their people from the Delta variant. But we cannot accept countries that have already used most of the global supply of vaccines using even more of it, while the Earth globe Europe-Africa's most vulnerable people remain unprotected," the WHO chief said.Also Read | These countries have made Covid-19 vaccination mandatory amid Delta surgeTedros stressed the need for an urgent reversal of vaccination supply, saying a majority of vaccines are going to high-income countries when low-income countries have only been able to administer “1.5 syringe for every 100 people.” Referring to his earlier call for global support to enable countries to vaccinate at least 10% of their population, the WHO chief lamented that they aren’t on track to achieve the target."Accordingly, WHO is calling for a moratorium on boosters until at least the end of September, to enable at least 10% of the population of every country to be vaccinated," Tedros said, adding that the plan needs the cooperation of a "handful of countries and companies that control the global supply of vaccines."Underscoring the importance of G20 countries in fighting the pandemic, Tedros said that the "course of the pandemic depends on the leadership of the G20 countries." He also urged everyone with "influence", including Olympics athletes and business and faith leaders, to call for the moratorium on booster shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-calls-for-moratorium-on-covid-booster-shots-as-delta-variant-threatens-lives-101628092019266.html
04-08-2021||World||These countries have made Covid-19 vaccination mandatory amid Delta surge||The spread of the highly contagious Delta variant of coronavirus and slowdown in vaccination rates have prompted several countries to make vaccination mandatory for certain groups, including health workers and people at high risk. During the initial days of vaccine rollout, governments around the world have said that the vaccination will not be made compulsory but encouraged people to get jabbed.However, the rise in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases largely driven by the Delta variant has threatened the gains made through vaccination and other social distancing measures. Australia, known for its relatively successful Covid-19 response, has been witnessing a worrying surge in infections. In late June, Australia made vaccinations mandatory for high-risk aged-care workers and employees in quarantine hotels in the wake of Delta variant spread.Here are some of the countries with compulsory vaccination policy for certain groups:BritainRelying on high vaccination rates, Britain removed almost all restrictions from July 19 amid the Covid-19 surge. It has made vaccination mandatory for care home workers in England from October. Those attending English nightclubs and large events will have to present a certificate of full vaccination from September end.United StatesFrom September 13, New York City will require proof of vaccination from customers and staff at restaurants, gyms and other indoor businesses. New York has mandated its state employees to either get vaccinated or get tested on a weekly basis from September 6. Several other US states have issued similar guidelines for government employees, health workers, and other groups as the Delta variant threatens to jeopardise the country’s Covid-19 response.All civilian federal workers will also need to get vaccinated and undergo regular testing, social distancing, mask requirements and travel limits, reported news agency Reuters citing people familiar with the matter.Also Read | China pushes to vaccinate minors against Covid-19 amid surge in Delta casesFranceOn Monday, the French parliament approved a bill to make vaccinations mandatory for health workers.

He was found dead in his dormitory on July 29.The deceased’s autopsy has been completed and an official from the Indian embassy in Beijing who went to Tianjin, 100km from here, is coordinating with local police and authorities to secure an early release of the body.Efforts were on to persuade the local police to release the body at the earliest to make arrangements to ship it to India in the coming days. The transportation of the deceased’s body back to India could cost thousands of dollars.Several questions about the crime remain unanswered including the motive behind it, the exact time of the incident and whether the university had done - or is doing - enough for the safety and security of foreign students staying on campus.Indian embassy officials have remained tight-lipped about the case other than responding to a senior BJP leader’s tweet about it.On Wednesday, the Chinese foreign ministry refused to share more details on the case. “The case is under investigation, and the details cannot be released at the moment,” the Chinese foreign ministry said to HT.The ministry was responding to a list of questions sent to them by HT on the crime. “Relevant Chinese authorities will handle the case according to law,” the statement said. “As for the repatriation of the body, relevant Chinese authorities will stay in communication with the Indian side and cooperate.”On Tuesday, the ministry said that Nagsen’s death was a homicide and a foreign student had been arrested in connection with the murder.The suspect’s nationality has not been disclosed so far.The transportation of the body back to India will take a while as currently there are no direct flights operating between India and China and it has to be repatriated through a third country, officials said.China has also tightened travel restrictions in view of the spike in Covid-19 cases in the past few days. “Let them continue the investigation after sending the remains home. We beg the Chinese and Indian authorities,” the deceased’s uncle Pankaj Paswan had said from Gaya on Tuesday.Despite the serious nature of the crime, which took place on the campus of a reputed university, Chinese media has blanked out the news about the case. Even well-known state-run English outlets like China Daily and the tabloid Global Times seemed to have skipped it until Wednesday night, a week after the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/murder-of-indian-student-in-china-talks-on-to-get-the-body-released-101628090623768.html

However, Pakistan NSA Yusuf did not elaborate on his options.This comment comes amid Islamabad's growing frustration over Joe Biden's snub to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan. Biden hasn't called Khan since he assumed office in January this year."The president of the United States hasn't spoken to the prime minister of such an important country who the US itself says is make-or-break in some cases, in some ways, in Afghanistan -- we struggle to understand the signal, right?" Yusuf said, as quoted by Dawn newspaper."We've been told every time that... [the phone call] will happen, it's technical reasons or whatever. But frankly, people don't believe it," he said. "If a phone call is a concession, if a security relationship is a concession, Pakistan has options," he added.Despite efforts from Pakistan NSA, Islamabad's ties with the US remains in a critical state. Top Pak top officials have been holding a series of meetings with the top US administration officials but 'divergent' views on Afghanistan and China have proved to be a hurdle between both the countries, The Nation reported citing a diplomatic source."Divergent views on Afghanistan and China factor are the reason for tense ties between Islamabad and Washington, after the meeting, the US National Security Adviser's tweet was focused on Afghanistan while there was no mention of Afghanistan in Dr Moeed Yousaf's tweet," the source informed.The US has urged Islamabad to put pressure on the Taliban, however, the Pakistan side made it clear that they do not have any control over the Taliban.In FT interview, Pak NSA complained about the US President's failure to contact Imran Khan as Washington sought help to stop the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan.Meanwhile, an official from the Biden administration told FT: "There are still a number of world leaders President Biden has not been able to speak with personally yet. He looks forward to speaking with Prime Minister Khan when the time is right."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-has-other-options-nsa-yusuf-tells-us-over-biden-snub-101628077430731.html
04-08-2021||World||Japan: Moderate Covid patients to isolate at home instead of hospitals as per new govt policy||Japan’s government is introducing a contentious new policy in which coronavirus patients with moderate symptoms will isolate at home instead of in hospitals, as new cases surge in Tokyo to record levels during the Olympic Games.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s plan, which aims to save hospital beds almost exclusively for those with serious symptoms or at risk of developing them, is a major policy shift as new cases in the capital have more than tripled since the Olympics began on July 23.Tokyo reported 4,166 new cases on Wednesday, an all-time high since the pandemic began early last year.The new policy, introduced this week, was debated in parliament on Wednesday. Opposition as well as some governing party lawmakers and experts charged that the lives of people isolating at home without adequate care would be at risk.Suga, who has been criticized for insisting on hosting the Olympics despite public virus fears, says there is no evidence linking the upsurge in cases to the Games.He defended the home isolation policy as a way to ensure that hospital care is available for seriously ill patients, and said the new plan is only for areas where hospitals are severely strained.Infections, propelled by the more contagious delta variant, could accelerate to 10,000 a day by mid-August, some experts say. They called for a current state of emergency in Tokyo and five other areas to be expanded nationwide. The emergency measures, which focus on alcohol bans and shorter hours for eateries, are increasingly ignored by the public, which has tired of restrictions.NHK public television and other media reported that Suga is expected to expand a milder version of the emergency measures to 13 prefectures from the current five.“The pandemic has now entered a new phase,” Health Minister Norihisa Tamura said in parliament. “Hospital capacity is limited."He defended the home isolation policy as necessary to prevent a medical collapse similar to what happened in April in Osaka, when thousands of people became sicker and some died at home while waiting for hospital beds.Tamura, cautioning against a repeat of that situation, urged people to avoid all non-essential outings to slow infections.In Tokyo, more than 14,000 patients with mild symptoms are currently isolating at home — more than a 10-fold increase from a month ago — and about 8,400 others are waiting for beds in hospitals or special hotels.Opposition lawmakers criticized Suga for not increasing hospital capacity sufficiently despite warnings about the fast-spreading delta variant. Coronavirus treatment in Japan is limited to public and university hospitals that have adequate facilities and expertise.“Lives that can be saved will be lost,” said Kazunori Yamanoi, a lawmaker from the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, calling isolation at home “abandonment.”Dr. Shigeru Omi, the government's top medical adviser, said patients at risk of developing serious symptoms while staying at home will need to be given proper support by community physicians who make household visits.Suga said vaccinations of elderly people have significantly reduced infections and that he plans to accelerate immunizations for younger people and inoculate 40% of the entire population by the end of August.Experts say higher vaccination rates are needed to control the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-limit-hospital-care-as-covid-19-cases-hit-new-high-101628082636835.html

While US President Joe Biden has rejected his predecessor’s approach to North Korea and its nuclear program, Pyongyang has been giving mixed signals to the new administration for restarting the talks.Park Jie-won, South Korea’s head of the National Intelligence Service (NIS), briefed the lawmakers on the matter a week after Pyongyang and Seoul restored hotlines suspended a year ago by North Korea, reported news agency Reuters. Citing the briefing by Park, Ha Tae-Keung, a member of the parliamentary intelligence committee, told reporters that North Korea has put some preconditions to reopen talks, including the lifting of sanctions banning exports of minerals and imports of refined oil and other necessities."I asked which necessities they want the most, and they said high-class liquors and suits were included, not just for Kim Jong Un's own consumption but to distribute to Pyongyang's elite," Reuters quoted the lawmaker as saying.Also Read | North Korea's Kim Jong Un seen with head bandage, sparks yet another round of health speculationUS secretary of state Antony Blinken has planned to participate in virtual meetings with his Southeast Asian counterparts where he will call on ASEAN countries to fully implement the sanctions on North Korea, state department spokesperson Ned Price said on Monday, indicating that Washington is not willing to lift any sanctions as a precondition to restart talks with Pyongyang.Price said the next day that the US welcomes the restoration of inter-Korean communication lines and is willing to meet North Korean leaders “anytime, anywhere, without preconditions.”“It’s up to [North Korea] to respond positively to that outreach,” he added.The UN Security Council has passed resolutions imposing a wide range of sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear programs and intercontinental ballistic missiles tests. The United States and other countries have imposed their own sanctions but haven’t been able to force North Korea to give up its nuclear and missile programmes."The United States should be able to bring them back to dialogue by readjusting some sanctions," said Kim Byung-kee, another South Korean legislator, citing Park.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lift-sanctions-on-liquor-and-suits-north-korea-s-precondition-to-restart-talks-with-us-101628080610724.html

Indonesia is the second country in Asia after India to reach this grim milestone. Health ministry data showed that Indonesia recorded 1,747 deaths in the past 24 hours, pushing the cumulative count to 100,636.Indonesia has now joined the list of countries including India and Brazil which have lost more than 100,000 people due to Covid-19 since the beginning of the pandemic last year.According to news agency Associated Press, it took 14 months for Indonesia to cross the 50,000-mark at the end of May this year, and just more than two months to double it. However, experts have pointed out the real figures are greater than what the official data shows.Indonesia has been grappling with a severe shortage of oxygen to treat critical patients. Hospitals across have been running out of beds because of which many of such patients are dying either by isolating at home or waiting to receive urgent care. The World Health Organization (WHO) earlier said that hospitals require more isolation rooms, oxygen supplies, medical and personal equipment and also body bags and mobile field hospitals.Since June, over 2,800 people have died during self-isolation at home, according to data presented by crowd sourcing platform LaporCovid-19, which keeps track of deaths at home. “They were rejected by the hospitals, so they went back home and did the self-isolation at home with limited access to medicine, no oxygen and no monitoring from doctors until they died,” Ahmad Arif, one of the founding members of LaporCovid-19, told the Associated Press.And in July, when the highly infectious Delta variant emerged, more than 30,000 deaths were reported in the country, over triple than the 7,914 deaths seen in June. The government in July had implemented the strictest curbs on movement in Java island and Bali to curb the spread of Covid-19, and further introduced similar curbs across the country.Even though the government is now speeding up its vaccination rollout and has diverted most of the industrial oxygen production for medical use and has come up with more isolation rooms and field hospitals, the situation still remains critical.Just 8% of the total 270 million in Indonesia have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, and the government is aiming to administer 2.5 million doses a day in August and in September, according to Bloomberg.Recently, the country started receiving jabs from Pfizer and Moderna through the COVAX programme and other bilateral deals. Among those people who haven’t been inoculated, 80% said they were waiting for a slot, are looking out for available vaccines or haven’t been vaccinated due to other reasons, Bloomberg further reported.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesias-covid-19-toll-breaches-100-000-1-747-deaths-seen-in-last-24-hrs-101628078352739.html

More than 450 people have been infected in two weeks, with the latest outbreak spreading to at least 18 provinces and sending millions into lockdown.As many as 71 new domestic cases were reported on Wednesday for the previous day, the highest daily count in China since January.China is scrambling to contain the new outbreak, which started from the eastern city of Nanjing in the third week of July, but has since triggered pockets of resurgence in cities such as Beijing and Wuhan where the coronavirus first emerged in late 2019. Cities such as Nanjing, Zhengzhou and Wuhan have ordered mass testing of all residents - in Nanjing’s case, the fourth round of testing is currently ongoing.Authorities feel vaccinating minors could help in containing the outbreak.A vaccination campaign for minors aged between 12 and 17 should be expanded across the country, an education ministry notice issued on Tuesday said.Vaccination should be promoted to all eligible students below the age of 18, the notice, quoted by official media, said.The anti-Covid jabs should be administered both with consent of the students or their guardians, the notice added.China administered about 19.2 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines on August 2, bringing the total shots given to 1.689 billion doses, data from the national health commission (NHC) said on Tuesday - the highest number in the world.A few Chinese provinces had announced vaccination plans for the 12-17 age group in July, but the campaign hadn’t really taken off among teenagers.However, the sudden surge in cases of the Delta variant has pushed authorities to promote the campaign as teenagers are considered to be an important part of the effort to build herd immunity in society.Tao Lina, a Shanghai-based vaccine expert, told the state-run tabloid Global Times that children and teenagers are key groups for China to achieve herd immunity, and most teens do not have immunity to Covid-19, so vaccination could protect them against severe symptoms and death.Meanwhile, China has “imposed massive travel restrictions, including temporary closure of airports and travel alerts for citizens to other places across the country”, to contain the ongoing outbreak, news agency Xinhua reported on Wednesday.All 31 provincial-level regions in the Chinese mainland have urged citizens not to go to medium and high-risk areas for Covid-19 or leave the provinces where they live unless it is necessary.By Tuesday afternoon, China had four high-risk areas and 125 medium-risk areas for Covid-19.Meanwhile, China’s gambling hub, Macau, will test its 600,000 people and close some entertainment spots after four new coronavirus cases, its government said on Wednesday.The latest resurgence in cases in a city that has seen very few infections over the past year and a half has raised concerns that casinos, Macau’s main economic engine and source of revenues, may have to close in the near-term if the spread is not contained, Reuters reported.Mainland China had recorded 93,289 confirmed cases by Tuesday. The overall death toll was 4,636.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-pushes-to-vaccinate-minors-against-covid-19-amid-surge-in-delta-cases-101628071962619.html
04-08-2021||World||Herd immunity unlikely in our lifetimes, should be heading UK's way: Expert||People should avoid using the term ‘herd immunity’ in the context of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as it is unlikely to materialise during our lifetimes, an expert has warned. Herd immunity is a stage where a certain percentage of the population gets infected with the virus and develops immunity against it, breaking the transmission chain. It interrupts the transmission chain and the virus spread is brought to an almost absolute halt.Herd immunity was one of the most talked-about concepts, and many believed that the world will reach a stage where the virus will get eliminated. In an article for The Conversation, Shabir A. Madhi, dean faculty of health sciences and professor of vaccinology at the University of the Witwatersrand, has now said that the virus is unlikely to be eliminated.Madhi listed several reasons that, he said, have forced a shift in our thinking about herd immunity, including the mutations making the virus more transmissible and their ability to evade vaccine-induced immunity. The inequitable distribution of vaccines across the world, with low- and lower-middle-income countries largely bearing the brunt of it, provides fertile ground for the virus to mutate, he added.Also Read | Centre says coronavirus case trajectory in eight states concerningMadhi opined that since no country will lock its border perpetually, the entire global population will need to reach a similar immunity threshold about the same time. He suggested that the world should rather be heading the way the UK has moved - high vaccination rates and getting back to a relatively normal lifestyle.“The UK experience is where we should be heading. That is getting back to a relatively normal lifestyle, provided that we’ve got a adequate number of people vaccinated, and particularly people who are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19,” he wrote.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has long back ruled out herd immunity strategy as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic, calling it scientifically and ethically problematic. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had stressed that herd immunity has never in the history of public health been used as a strategy for responding to a virus outbreak.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/herd-immunity-unlikely-in-our-lifetimes-should-be-heading-uk-s-way-expert-101628070810303.html

It has also made children as young as 12 eligible for inoculation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-reimposes-more-curbs-as-amid-covid-19-surge-101628066385354.html

The company has a controversial policy against fact-checking political ads, which led to criticism that candidates would pay the company to spread lies through their ads. Facebook eventually halted all new political ads in the week leading up to the 2020 US election in an effort to fight misinformation.Last October, Facebook sent the researchers a cease-and-desist letter demanding they stop collecting targeting data about Facebook political ads, and threatening “additional enforcement action.” Laura Edelson, a researcher at NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering, told the Wall Street Journal at the time that the group would stop if Facebook published the more nuanced data itself.Clark said Facebook offers targeting data sets for political ads, and has suggested the NYU group use that information. According to Facebook’s terms of service, a user may not “access or collect data from our products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data you do not have permission to access.”Facebook moved to penalize the researchers in part to remain in compliance with a 2019 data privacy agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, in which the company was punished for failing to police how data was collected by outside developers, Clark said. Facebook was fined a record $5 billion as part of a settlement with regulators.Edelson, a PhD candidate in computer science and the lead researcher behind the group, confirmed that her personal Facebook account and those of some of her colleagues were disabled Tuesday night. By cutting the group’s access to Facebook’s data stream, the company is essentially ending NYU’s effort to study misinformation in political ads, she added.“Facebook is silencing us because our work often calls attention to problems on its platform,” Edelson wrote in an emailed statement. “Worst of all, Facebook is using user privacy, a core belief that we have always put first in our work, as a pretext for doing this. If this episode demonstrates anything it’ is that Facebook should not have veto power over who is allowed to study them.”The NYU-led research project started before the 2020 US election to better study the thousands of political ads on the social network. Political ads on Facebook are public in a searchable database, including some demographic data about the gender and location of people who saw the ad. But the database doesn’t include details about how an ad was targeted, part of the information the Ad Observatory was trying to collect.Facebook’s political ad library is “is complicated to use, untold numbers of political ads are missing, and a significant element is lacking: how advertisers choose which specific demographics and groups of people should see their ad -- and who shouldn’t,” the Ad Observatory researchers said on their website.For instance, the Ad Observatory revealed that Jon Ossoff, a Georgia Democrat, targeted Facebook users who were interested in topics such as former president Barack Obama, comedian Trevor Noah and Time magazine during his campaign for US Senate. His opponent, former Republican Senator David Perdue, targeted users who liked Sean Hannity’s show on Fox News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-disables-accounts-tied-to-nyu-research-project-sparks-outrage-101628065367540.html
04-08-2021||World||Pakistan's Imran Khan under fire over 'failure' to exit FATF grey list||Pakistan opposition slammed the federal government of Imran Khan over its failure to remove the country from Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) grey list.Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) MNA and former prime minister Raja Pervez Ashraf asked the federal government to tell the National Assembly about the only condition which Pakistan had not so far fulfilled to come out of the FATF grey list, reported Dawn.Responding to the question Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Muhammad Khan on Monday said that the only point left for implementation was regarding the prosecution of some people.He said the country had not been able to come out of the FATF grey list because of political reasons and not on technical grounds, adding that when Prime Minister Imran Khan had taken a bold stance of saying "no" then "the nation will have to definitely pay the price [for it]".The question about FATF conditions had originally been asked by PPP's Shamim Ara Panhwar and it was deferred by the speaker during the assembly session in May.In a written reply to the question, Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin told the assembly that the FATF had reviewed Pakistan's progress on the FATF action plan in its plenary meeting held on February 25.He said Pakistan had undertaken enormous work to strengthen its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) regime and address the strategic counterterrorism financing-related deficiencies, reported Dawn."This work has been acknowledged by the FATF in its plenary statement by taking note of the significant progress made on the entire action plan and by largely addressing 24 out of the 27 action items in the action plan," the minister said, adding: "As of now, all the 10 action items pertaining to the financial sector and border controls have been addressed."In relation to terrorism financing investigations and prosecutions, he said six of the eight action items had been addressed, whereas, for targeted financial sanctions, eight of the nine action items also stood addressed, reported Dawn."Pakistan has also made notable progress in the remaining three action items which also stand partially addressed. The progress on the remaining three action items is well underway with significant progress made so far and it is expected that Pakistan would complete the remaining action plan items by FATF plenary of June 2021 and would become eligible to exit from the grey list in accordance with FATF International Cooperation Review Group (ICRG) procedures," the minister stated in his reply which had been submitted to the National Assembly Secretariat before the June 21 FATF plenary.Pakistan, however, had been retained in the grey list while failing to complete one action plan point.Pakistan was retained on the FATF's 'grey list' for failing to effectively implement the global FATF standards and over its lack of progress on investigation and prosecution of senior leaders and commanders of UN-designated terror groups.Announcing the decision at a virtual press conference five-day plenary meeting, FATF President Dr Marcus Pleyer had said Pakistan will remain on the grey list till it addresses all items on the original action plan agreed to in June 2018 as well as all items on a parallel action plan handed out by the watchdog's regional partner - the Asia Pacific Group (APG) - in 2019.Pakistan has been on the FATF's grey list for deficiencies in its counter-terror financing and anti-money laundering regimes since June 2018.Pakistan is facing the difficult task of getting its name off from the FATF grey list. As things stand, Islamabad is finding it difficult to shield terror perpetrators and implement the FATF action plan at the same time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistans-imran-khan-under-fire-over-failure-to-exit-fatf-grey-list-101628058097886.html
04-08-2021||World||UNSC condemns Afghanistan violence, says it won’t support ‘Islamic emirate’||The UN Security Council on Tuesday condemned deliberate and targeted attacks on civilians in Afghanistan and declared that it does “not support the restoration of the Islamic emirate” as the pre-2001 Taliban regime used to call itself.In a statement issued on the second day of the Indian presidency, the UNSC slammed the attack on a UN compound in Herat last week. It said that “deliberate attacks targeting civilians, United Nations personnel and United Nations compounds may constitute war crimes”.All UNSC members are concerned about the escalating violence in Afghanistan, as the statement reflected. A request is understood to have been moved for a UNSC meeting on the situation in the country, which would signal heightened concerns in the top UN body.Calling for an immediate reduction in violence, the UNSC said “sustainable peace can be achieved only through a comprehensive and inclusive Afghan-led, Afghan-owned peace process that aims at a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire, as well as an inclusive, just and realistic political settlement to end the conflict in Afghanistan”.The UNSC members directed their attention to the Taliban’s plans to restore the “Islamic emirate”, as their regime was called before it was overthrown in October 2001 by a US-led invasion following the 9/11 terror attacks in the US.“The members of the Security Council recalled resolution 2513 (2020) reaffirmed that there is no military solution to the conflict, and declared that they do not support the restoration of the Islamic emirate,” the statement said.It was referring to a resolution adopted by the UNSC in March 2020 welcoming peace talks and efforts following the signing of the US-Taliban accord. It had said, among other things, that the “Islamic emirate of Afghanistan is not recognised at the United States, and furthermore that the UN Security Council does not support the restoration of the Islamic emirate of Afghanistan”.The Taliban has advanced aggressively in recent weeks as the pullout of US-led international forces nears completion much ahead of the September 11 deadline self-imposed by US President Joe Biden. Their military advance has been accompanied by the return of brutal and barbaric violence and practices that had marked their 1996-2001 reign.INDIA WATCHING CLOSELYIndia has followed the situation in Afghanistan closely and has called for a “permanent and comprehensive ceasefire”, which was reflected in Tuesday’s statement. Afghanistan will be a key issue that could dominate India’s term as the rotational president of the Security Council for the month of August.The UNSC statement called on the Islamic Republic - as Afghanistan is called - and the Taliban to “engage meaningfully in an inclusive, Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process in order to make urgent progress towards a political settlement and a ceasefire”. The Security Council also stressed on “the need for full, equal and meaningful participation of women”.The Afghan government and the Taliban are barely talking as the insurgents have been focused on expanding their areas of influence through military advances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unsc-condemns-afghanistan-violence-says-it-won-t-support-islamic-emirate-101628053298515.html

"Shame to its backer(s)," Saleh had said in the tweet posted hours before he took part in the protest.For six year, Saleh was a key figure in the anti-Taliban fight as head of the National Directorate for Security (NDS). He became Afghanistan's vice president in 2020. An ethnic Tajik, Saleh was a prominent member of the movement which fought the Taliban during the 1990s.In July, Saleh had said that the diplomatic community of Pakistan is working hard to painting and decorating a fictional image for the Taliban. "On the ground, however, Talibs 2.0 is nothing but an Afghanistan replica of IS-K and Al-Qadea, providing bases to foreign "good and bad terrorists" The "good" LeT is their buddies in allegiance," Saleh had said in a tweet.Last week, residents in the western province of Herat braved the streets despite nearby fighting to protest against the Taliban. Other cities quickly organised to join from their homes in the evenings, as a message of support for security forces who are fighting the insurgent group.A car bomb blast followed by sporadic gunfire hit Afghanistan's capital Kabul on Tuesday near the heavily fortified "Green Zone", leaving three civilians and three attackers dead, security officials said amid an upturn in violence by Taliban militants.At least seven other people were wounded, said health ministry spokesperson Ghulam Dastagir Nazari.

04-08-2021||World||Pakistan to rent out PM’s official house to manage 'financial crunch': Report||Reeling from a financial crunch, Pakistan has now put its prime minister Imran Khan's official residence in Islamabad on the market for rent, according to a report by news agency ANI citing the local media. Earlier, the ruling Tehreek-Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government led by Khan had announced its plans to convert the prime minister's residence into a university. However, that plan has now reportedly been dropped, with the federal government instead deciding to rent out the property. Imran Khan had vacated his official residence in Islamabad after the Pakistan government announced in August 2019 its plan to convert the prime minister's house into a state-of-the-art federal educational institution. According to a report by Samaa TV, the federal government has decided to rent out the property to people who want to hold cultural, fashion, educational, and other events at the premises located at the Red Zone in Islamabad."Two committees have been formed for this purpose. They will be responsible for ensuring the discipline and decorum of the PM House are not violated during the events," Saama TV said.According to local media, the federal cabinet will meet and discuss ways to garner revenue from the PM House building.The auditorium of the prime minister's house, two guest wings, and a lawn will probably be rented out to generate funds. High-level diplomatic functions and international seminars will also be held at the former principal workplace of the Pakistani premier.Imran Khan, after taking over as Pakistan's prime minister, had announced that the federal government doesn't have the money to spend on public welfare schemes, while a few people in the country are "living like our colonial masters used to live". He has since then been living at his Bani Gala residence and only uses the prime minister's office.Pakistan's economy has shrunk by USD 19 billion in the last three years since Khan came to the power. When he became the prime minister, he took many austere steps to cut down government expenses to give respite to the country's economy.Earlier, former finance minister Miftah Ismail remarked that the Imran Khan-led regime was "toying with the economy", adding that it had increased the loans of the government and state institutions by ₹45,000 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-rent-out-pm-s-official-house-to-manage-financial-crunch-report-101628040583051.html

04-08-2021||World||Number Theory: A story of two worlds hit differently by the Delta variant of Covid||New infections of Covid-19 have once again started surging across the world, with several countries reporting a record number of new infections. Experts have blamed the latest surge on the global spread of the Delta variant, a highly contagious variant of Sars-CoV-2. The Delta variant, which was first identified in India late last year, is expected to become the dominant strain of the virus over the coming months, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).As of August 1, the variant had spread to 132 countries and territories, and caused a massive rise in infections in many of these nations.But despite the rapid rise of new infections in these countries, their experiences in dealing with the outbreak is turning out entirely different due to just one factor — vaccination. While the West, which has managed to cover large swathes of its population, has managed to keep its deaths far lower than in previous waves, nations in Asia and Africa are struggling. Here’s a look at how the “Delta waves” are charting different statistics in the rich first world and the not-so-rich developing world.1. Delta variant pushes new infections globally againFor the week ending June 21, the seven-day average of new cases across the world dropped to 359,095 a day – the lowest this figure had touched since February. Through most of June, with the exception of a handful of countries, new cases were dropping almost everywhere in the world’s major hot-spot nations, which was a good sign even as countries, especially in the West, rushed to cover as many people as possible with vaccines. But the “Delta wave” has since emerged. In the past week, more than 600,000 new cases were reported across the world every day, according to global case data maintained by Our World In Data. This is the highest daily case rate seen in at least two months; worryingly, the number is continuing to rise.2. Cases rise in the vaccinated West, but deaths remain lowThe case trajectories (seven-day average of new infections) of five Western nations – the United States, the United Kingdom, Portugal, France and Spain – where the Delta variant has been wreaking havoc show an alarming spike over the past few weeks.All have completely vaccinated large proportions of their populations and feature among the countries with highest vaccine coverage in the world. Spain has fully vaccinated 57.6% of its residents, while the UK has done so for 56.5% of its population. In Portugal, 55.7% of the country is fully vaccinated while this number is 50.2% in the US and 47.1% in France.While the highly infectious variant caused a spike in cases in these nations, deaths have remained low. In Spain, while there were 22,990 new cases every day in the past week, there were only 54 deaths a day on average. This translates to only 0.2% of infections in the past week resulting in deaths. The same proportion of cases have resulted in deaths in France as well, while deaths in the past week touched 0.3% of cases in the UK, 0.4% in Portugal and 0.5% in the US. The charts here show how the latest outbreaks in these countries are nowhere as fatal as previous waves – a clear result of the protection offered by vaccination.3. Developing and unvaccinated world sees deaths soarThe story that is playing out in Asia and Africa, however, is very different. Asia, in particular, has borne the biggest brunt of the Delta variant.For residents of these nations, access to vaccines has not been as easy as it has been in the West. For reasons ranging from supply issues to affordability to inability of their governments to cover their populations quickly with shots, the countries listed here have all managed to completely vaccinate only tiny proportions of their populations. For instance, Bangladesh has fully vaccinated just 2.6% of its residents, while Iran has managed to cover 2.9% of its citizens. In Thailand, just 5.2% of the nation’s population is completely vaccinated, while this number is 7.6% in Indonesia and 8.2% in Tunisia.While India’s second wave may have been brought under control for now, in the past few weeks, nations such as Indonesia and Thailand have become two of the world’s biggest outbreak centres with the spread of the Delta variant. But the biggest concern for these nations is not the rate at which cases have soared, but of rising deaths.Fatalities in these regions have soared to record highs, and continue to rise at an alarming rate. With the exception of Iran, average daily deaths in these countries are currently at record highs. Even in the case of Iran, it appears that the death trajectory will scale the previous record in a few days, unless the trend reverses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/number-theory-a-story-of-two-worlds-hit-differently-by-the-delta-variant-of-covid-101628032013214.html
04-08-2021||World||Bomb, gun assault targeting Afghanistan's defence minister ends with all attackers killed: Ministry||Four people were killed and 20 wounded in a coordinated bomb and gun attack targeting the Afghan defence minister and several lawmakers in the country's capital Tuesday, not far from the heavily fortified Green Zone.The wave of blasts, which Washington said bore the "hallmarks" of the Taliban, came as the Afghan army urged residents to evacuate a besieged southern city ahead of a planned offensive against the insurgents after three days of heavy fighting.Violence has surged across the country since early May when the Taliban launched a nationwide offensive soon after the US-led foreign forces began their final withdrawal.Security officials told AFP four people were killed and 20 others wounded in Tuesday's attack, with medical charity Emergency saying four bodies of people killed in the assault had been brought to its facility in Kabul.The interior ministry said the attack had been successfully repelled and all the attackers had been killed by security forces."A big number of people were rescued and the area is secured now," spokesman Mirwais Stanikzai told reporters.The first bomb blew up in central Kabul late on Tuesday, sending a thick plume of smoke into the sky, AFP correspondents reported.Defence Minister Bismillah Mohammadi said it was a suicide car bomb attack targeting his house."Unfortunately some of my guards are wounded," he added in a video message.Less than two hours after the car bomb detonated, another loud blast followed by smaller explosions and rapid gunfire again shook Kabul, also near the high-security Green Zone that houses several embassies, including the US mission.A security source said several attackers had stormed a lawmaker's house after setting off the car bomb and were also shooting at the residence of the defence minister from there."Several lawmakers were meeting at the house of this MP to make a plan to counter the Taliban offensive in the north," the source told AFP.- 'Hallmarks of Taliban attacks' -No group has yet claimed the attack, but Washington pointed the finger at the Taliban."We're not in a position to attribute it officially just yet but of course it does bear all the hallmarks of the spate of Taliban attacks that we have seen in recent weeks," State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters."We unequivocally condemn the bombing, and we continue to stand by our (Afghan) partners."Even as the blasts and gunfire rocked the city, crowds of people marched down Kabul's streets and took to rooftops chanting "Allahu Akbar" and "Death to the Taliban" in support of Afghan forces battling the insurgents in three regional capitals."We are in support of Afghan forces and all those who are against the Taliban and fighting on the frontlines," said Karim, a resident of Kabul who gave only one name.The insurgents' assaults on the cities of Lashkar Gah, Kandahar and Herat since last week came after they seized control of much of rural Afghanistan, as foreign forces began the last stage of their withdrawal from the country in May.Fighting is raging for control of Lashkar Gah, the capital of southern Helmand province, with the United Nations saying at least 40 civilians were killed in the last 24 hours.General Sami Sadat, commander of the 215 Maiwand Afghan Army Corps, urged residents to evacuate."Please leave as soon as possible so that we can start our operation," he said in a message to the city of 200,000 people."I know it is very difficult for you to leave your houses -- it is hard for us too -- but if you are displaced for a few days, please forgive us."We are fighting the Taliban wherever they are," he said.Officials said earlier that insurgents had seized more than a dozen local radio and TV stations in Lashkar Gah, leaving only one pro-Taliban channel broadcasting Islamic programming.The UN Assistance Mission for Afghanistan (UNAMA) tweeted its "deepening concern for Afghan civilians... as fighting worsens" and called for an "immediate end to fighting in urban areas".- 'Taliban are everywhere' -Sefatullah, director of Sukon radio in Lashkar Gah said: "Fighting was intense this morning".He said US and Afghan air force planes had pounded Taliban positions, and that fighting was ongoing near the city's prison and a compound housing the headquarters of police and intelligence agencies."The Taliban are everywhere in the city, you can see them on motorcycles in the streets. They are arresting or shooting people who have smartphones," a resident of Lashkar Gah told AFP, on condition of anonymity.The loss of Lashkar Gah would be a massive strategic and psychological blow for the government, which has pledged to defend cities at all costs after losing much of the rural countryside to the Taliban over the summer.In the western city of Herat that is also under siege, officials said government forces had managed to push back the insurgents from several areas -- including near the airport, which is vital for supplies.But on Tuesday afternoon, four rockets struck the airport. The facility was not damaged, airport chief Shaheer Salehi told AFP, but two flights were cancelled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/attack-targeting-afghanistan-s-defence-minister-ends-with-all-attackers-killed-ministry-101628022304940.html

The cities of Nanjing and Yangzhou in Jiangsu province in eastern China have cancelled all domestic flights, and Beijing has halted long-distance trains from 23 stations in the affected regions.Led by the national health commission, China has stepped up efforts to contain a new cluster of Covid-19 infections - the biggest in China since last year.In a related development, Zhangjiajie in Hunan province has ordered all residents and tourists not to leave the city to control a cluster outbreak of the Delta variant of Covid-19.NYC will require jab proof for indoor dining, gymsNew York City will soon require proof of Covid-19 vaccinations for anyone who wants to dine indoors at a restaurant, see a performance or go to the gym, mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Tuesday, making it the first big city in the US to impose such restrictions.Greece and Sweden plan booster shotsA large part of Sweden’s population is likely to be offered a top-up dose of a Covid-19 vaccine next year, according to the public health agency. Greece is also ready to start administering third doses for vulnerable groups.On the vaccination front, half of the population of the EU has been fully vaccinated, according to an AFP tally on Tuesday.In the US, 70% of adults have received at least one dose, a key milestone in the fight against the pandemic that the country hit nearly a month later than President Joe Biden had hoped.US Senator Lindsey Graham, meanwhile, said he has tested positive for Covid-19 despite being vaccinated, becoming at least the third member of Congress to recently report a coronavirus infection.Israel said on Tuesday it will require all persons arriving from the United States and 17 other countries to quarantine starting next week as the country grapples with a surge in coronavirus infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/its-deja-vu-in-china-s-wuhan-as-mass-testing-for-covid-19-returns-101628002831593.html
04-08-2021||World||Chinese government confirms Indian student was murdered, 1 held||The Chinese police have taken into custody a foreign student at Tianjin Foreign Studies University (TFSU) in connection with the murder of a 20-year-old Indian, a student at the same varsity, last week, people familiar with the development said.Aman Nagsen, a resident of Gaya in Bihar, was a student of international business studies at the university located in the city of Tianjin, around 100km south of Beijing. He was found dead on the campus on July 29.Preliminary examination of the body and the crime scene by Tianjin police confirmed that Nagsen was murdered, the Chinese foreign ministry told HT in a statement.“Around 8pm on the night of July 29, Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau (PSB) received a call saying that an Indian student was lying on the floor of the dormitory with no sign of life,” the statement said.“The initial investigation of the Public Security organ found the case to be homicide, and the suspect is another foreign student at the university. Compulsory measures have been taken on the suspect and the case is still under further investigation,” the statement added.HT has separately learnt that Nagsen was stabbed to death with a sharp-edged weapon.Neither the nationality of the suspect nor the motive behind the murder — what seems like a rare serious crime on a Chinese campus involving two foreigners — could be immediately confirmed. It also could not be known if the murder weapon was recovered by the investigators.The Chinese foreign ministry said it was in communication with the Indian embassy in Beijing on the case. The Indian embassy was informed about the case first on July 30 and then again on the following day, it added. “Relevant Chinese competent authorities had notified the Indian embassy in Beijing of the situation of the case on July 30 and 31, respectively, and maintained communication with the embassy,” the statement said.“The Chinese side will handle the case in accordance with law and offer active assistance in follow-up matters,” it added.Meanwhile, Nagsen’s grieving family in Gaya continued its appeal to authorities in India and China for help in getting the body back.“Let them continue with the investigation after sending the remains home. We beg the Chinese and Indian authorities,” the deceased’s uncle Pankaj Paswan said from Gaya.An official from the Indian embassy is said to have gone to Tianjin to coordinate the release of the body with local Chinese authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/foreign-student-in-custody-for-murdering-indian-student-at-university-in-china-101627995091386.html
04-08-2021||World||Chinese channel airs footage of Galwan Valley clash to mark PLA Day||China’s official English television channel, CGTN, has uploaded a video on one of the four People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers who died fighting Indian troops in Galwan Valley in June 2020 on social media and its website to mark the armed forces’ founding day on August 1.The focus of the video is Chen Hongjun, one of the four PLA troops killed in the brutal fight with Indian border personnel on the night of June 15, 2020.Besides interviews of Chen’s family members, including his wife, the video shows edited footage of the clash between the two armies, Chinese equipment on the banks of the fast flowing river, soldiers, mostly Chinese, wading in knee-deep water, and personnel from the two sides charging at each other.“To mark PLA Day, also known as Army Day, CGTN’s special series brings you Chen’s story,” the CGTN video said.The video, evidently pitched as a propaganda piece aimed at a domestic Chinese audience, begins with a one-sided introduction to the Galwan Valley clash. “Indian army violated the bilateral consensus and crossed the Line of Actual Control on June 15, 2020,” it says - a claim repeatedly dismissed by India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-tv-channel-uploads-footage-of-galwan-valley-clash-to-mark-army-day-101627988551003.html
04-08-2021||India||Kerala’s high caseload, double digit TPR worries medical experts||Kerala, a small state with barely 3% of India’s population, has been accounting for more than half of country’s Covid-19 virus cases recently, and the medical experts feel that the trend of rising cases in the state is not a good sign. However, the government has pointed out that the health infrastructure in the state is not overburdened.Statistics show that there has been no sign of flattening of the curve and cases have increased steadily for more than two months in the state, a grim reality, which is also reflected in the state’s double digit test positivity rate for more than a month now.What adds to Kerala’s intriguing battle with the pandemic is the fact that the state claims to have done well in managing the case fatality rate, vaccination drive, testing and tracing of contacts and hospitals have not been overflowing with patients recently. But before the state could get a handle on its challenges, some experts are already warning about the possible onset of a “third wave”.“The consistent surge indicates that this may be the beginning of a fresh wave. [Whether] you name it the second or the third wave, it is a fact [that the] cases are going up alarmingly,” said public health expert Dr S S Lal, who earlier worked with the World Health Organisation.Internal medicine expert Dr N M Arun, who has been studying the case trajectory of the state, agreed. “The state is going through a fresh wave and if the cases [continue to] rise like this, [the] system will drain,” he said.Out of the 18 worst affected districts in the country, 10 are in Kerala, where districts such as Malapppuram have over 15% TPR (test positivity rate). The district also has an active caseload of 21,603 as on Tuesday and its recovery rate is also slow. The TPR is the percentage of all Covid tests that turn out to be positive.Malappuram, Thrissur, Ernakulam, Kozhikode, Palakkad and Kasarago are the six districts where the average TPR has stayed in double digits for more than a week. Experts note that most infections are spreading through home isolation cases. According to the state’s latest sero survey, around 50% of the population is still susceptible to the virus.“Since half of the population is not affected, we have to vaccinate them on a war footing. We are in touch with the Union government,” said health minister Veena George.Government claims that despite the high volume of cases, pressure is not visible on the health system. Out of the 4,250 ICU and ventilator beds available in both private and public facilities, 2,300 are occupied, including by 1,500 critically ill patients and 800 requiring ventilator support. The state also has 250 metric tonne oxygen in stock.Kerala reported 22,414 Covid cases on Wednesday with a TPR of 11.37%. It also reported 108 deaths, taking total Covid fatalities to 17,211. Malappuram district topped the chart again with 3,691 fresh cases of the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keralas-high-caseload-double-digit-tpr-worries-medical-experts-101628101066216.html
04-08-2021||India||Will withdraw cases against Gorkhas in foreigners’ tribunals: Assam CM Sarma||GUWAHATI: The Assam cabinet has decided not to prosecute members of the Gorkha community under the Citizenship Act and withdraw all cases against community members in foreigners’ tribunals, chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said in a tweet after the cabinet meeting on Wednesday.The decisions, which were part of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s vision document ahead of the 2016 assembly polls, have been welcomed by the Gorkha community in Assam. According to the Assam unit of Bharatiya Gorkha Parisangh (BGP), nearly 22,000 Gorkha people in the state have been declared as ‘doubtful voters’ or D-voters, issued summons to appear before foreigners’ tribunals to prove citizenship and some even put in detention centres meant for illegal immigrants under the citizenship law.“Nearly 2,500 Gorkhas actually faced charges as D-voters, some were issued summon and some even spent time in detention centres. With our efforts, most of these cases have been resolved, but some are still pending,” Nanda Kirati Dewan, national secretary of BGP said. Dewan said the cabinet decision will come as a huge relief for Gorkha families who were prosecuted under the citizenship law. “It would also remove the tag of illegal immigrants or foreigners from members of the community who are residents of Assam and are Indian citizens. We want that the D-voter tags of Gorkhas removed so that they can exercise their right to vote,” he added. Persons against whom cases are pending in foreigners’ tribunals and their family members apart from those who are called D-voters in electoral rolls due to questions about their citizenship were not included in the updated National Register of Citizens (NRC) for Assam. The complete NRC, published in August 2019, also excluded names of 1.9 million of the 3.3 million people in the state who applied to include their names in the list that sought to weed out illegal immigrants. While most of those excluded were people who had roots in East Pakistan (later Bangladesh), the list also left out several people from the Gorkha community including Sahitya Academy Award winner Durga Khatiwada.In October 2018, the Union home ministry clarified that members of the Gorkha community who were Indians at the time of commencement of the Constitution, those who are Indian citizens by birth or those who have acquired citizenship by registration or naturalization are not ‘foreigners’ as defined by Foreigners Act, 1946 and Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939 and their cases should not be referred to foreigners tribunals. Citing the 1950 India-Nepal friendship treaty, the MHA clarified that members of the Gorkha community of neighbouring Nepal who entered India by land or air, with or without passport or visa and stayed in India for any length of time shall not be treated as illegal immigrants as long as they have some identity documents issued by Nepal government. They too shall not be referred to foreigners’ tribunals, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-withdraw-cases-against-gorkhas-in-foreigners-tribunals-assam-cm-sarma-101628099625887.html

04-08-2021||India||India for speeding up connectivity projects with Asean||India on Wednesday called for the speeding up of regional connectivity projects with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), including the trilateral highway with Myanmar and Thailand and the Kaladan transit transport project. While speaking at the virtual Asean-India foreign ministers meeting, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said New Delhi was also looking to an early review of the trade in goods agreement. In a set of tweets, Jaishankar described the meeting as “substantive and fruitful”. India, he tweeted, was looking forward to “accelerate our connectivity projects, especially trilateral highway and Kaladan project”. He didn’t give details. The Indian side has helped construct two key stretches of the 1,360-km trilateral highway in Myanmar, but work on several other sections and the upgrade of nearly 70 bridges has been held up by a variety of factors. India believes the highway, which will run from Moreh in Manipur to Mae Sot in Thailand, will allow it to access markets across the Asean region and boost people-to-people ties. Work on the $484-million Kaladan project, which will connect Kolkata port with Sittwe port in Myanmar’s Rakhine state, has been affected by the activities of militant groups such as the Arakan Army and land acquisition issues on the Indian side. New Delhi has been pushing for a review of the India-Asean trade in goods agreement, which entered into force in January 2010. Under the pact, the Asean states and India agreed to open their markets by progressively reducing and eliminating duties on 76.4% coverage of goods. The Indian side believes an early review of the agreement will help achieve the true trade potential between the two sides. The review is expected to include issues such as customs procedures, exchange of data and further liberalisation of trade. “Much of India’s interests and relationships now lie to its East, a testimony of its ties with Asean,” Jaishankar said in a tweet. India also seeks convergence between its Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative and the Asean outlook on the Indo-Pacific, he said. At the same time, India will support the initiative for Asean integration through capacity-building initiatives and also contribute through Mekong-Ganga cooperation and quick impact projects, he added. Jaishankar noted that the two sides had been strong partners in the Covid-19 response, including on medicines, oxygen, equipment and logistics. While backing the Asean position on resolving maritime issues, Jaishankar said India believes the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) sets out the “accepted legal framework for all maritime activities”. The minister subsequently addressed the virtual East Asia Summit foreign ministers’ meeting that was joined by the representatives of Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, the US and the 10 Asean members. Jaishankar highlighted the growing convergence of approaches on the Indo-Pacific among the members, and stressed that the “Code of Conduct on South China Sea should be fully consistent with UNCLOS 1982”. The code, he said, “should not prejudice legitimate rights and interests of nations not party to discussions”. Asean and China plan to draft the Code of Conduct to serve as a framework with rules and standards to cope with long-standing disputes in the South China Sea. Jaishankar also supported Asean’s five-point consensus for the situation in Myanmar and welcomed the appointment of a special envoy by the grouping to deal with the issue. The five-point consensus, adopted at an Asean leaders’ meeting in April following the military coup in Myanmar, called for an immediate cessation of violence and utmost restraint from all parties, constructive dialogue to find a peaceful solution, the appointment of a special envoy to facilitate mediation, provision of humanitarian aid, and visit to Myanmar by the special envoy. Asean on Wednesday announced Brunei’s second minister for foreign affairs, Erywan Yusof, had been appointed as the special envoy. The appointment was delayed by divisions within the grouping.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-for-speeding-up-connectivity-projects-with-asean-101628098065595.html
04-08-2021||India||Number of waves doesn't matter: What experts say on Covid 3rd wave in India||If in any particular area, the number of Covid-19 cases is increasing, it does not matter whether it is the second wave of the pandemic or the third wave as the interventions will be similar, experts said amid ongoing speculations over the 3rd wave of the pandemic which, according to several projections, may hit India in August."The wave or cycle is of academic significance only. If cases are rising, it does not matter whether that is a continuation of the second wave or the start of the next wave," Delhi-based physician-epidemiologist and health systems expert Chandrakant Lahariya told PTI.Researchers of IIT Hyderabad and Kanpur, who had predicted the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, have said the third wave may peak in October. Reacting to this, joint secretary of the Union health ministry Lav Agarwal has said that the second wave is still not over in India as around 40,000 new Covid-19 infections are being recorded every day.There have been several projections and opinions regarding the third wave in India. Here is all we know:> Mathematically, the timing of the third wave in India can be predicted and July-August was predicted as the arrival time of the wave while the peak may come in October.> The ground situation may be different from the mathematical model as the wave will depend on human behaviour and vaccine coverage.> The impact of the wave will not be the same across the country, as vaccination coverage, exposure to the virus is different.> The severity of the third wave will not be like that of the second wave. It will be a "blunted" wave compared to the devastating second wave, Scientist Gautam Menon told PTI.> Several states are witnessing a small spike in Covid-19 cases. But this can't be confirmed as the third wave, experts have opined. This spike can be a result of the lifting of the restrictions soon after the intensity of the second wave lessened.(With PTI Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/number-of-waves-doesn-t-matter-what-experts-say-on-covid-3rd-wave-in-india-101628096821470.html
04-08-2021||India||Govt refused. So Odisha man built 3 km road through hills. He took 30 years||Bhubaneswar: Thirty years ago, residents of Tulubi, a remote village in Odisha’s Nayagarh district, petitioned the administration for a three km stretch of road through the hills ad forest that would link their village to the main road. They just needed a walkable road so that people didn’t lose their way.But the request was rejected by the administration. The minister reportedly told them it was impossible.That is when Harihar Behera and his brother Krushna figured that if they needed the road, they would have to build it themselves. And they got down to work. With nothing more than a hammer, hoe and a crowbar.Harihar was then in his mid-twenties.Harihar Behera spent the next 30 years with his brother chipping the hills with a hammer to build the road, day after day, after finishing work on his fields.The brothers first cleared part of the forest and tried to blast the large rocks with small explosives and carry the small rocks with the help of carts. But the blasting had a detrimental effect on the environment, so they stopped the blasting and again fell back on hammering large rocks.After Krushna Behera died due to a kidney ailment, Harihar carried on with his work all alone.“We could finally get a road a few years ago thanks to Harihar and his brother,” said Dinabandhu Jani, a local.Harihar said he saw no choice before him.“There was no way we could go to nearby town. Relatives, while visiting our village, used to forget the route and get lost in the forest. Around 30 years ago, we asked the district administration for roads in the village but as no one listened, I and my brother started making the road.... I and my elder brother worked on the road after finishing the agricultural work. Later, other villagers also helped,” said Harihar.Once he was finished with this stretch, Harihar Behera figured others needed his help. There were dozens of inaccessible villages in his district.Harihar selected Nepal, another inaccessible village inhabited by tribals. But this time, the administration stepped in after he had laid around 300 metres using rocks and build an all-weather road using concrete.His village too is going to get an all-weather road.Nayagarh sub-collector Lagnajit Rout said Harihar has done wonderful work to make his village accessible.“Only a man possessed can keep on doing such things for 30 years. There are several such villages in the district that are not easy to travel to due to the hills. The construction of road from Rohiba village on Bhanjanagar road to Tulubi village will be completed soon,” said Rout.To be sure, Behera isn’t the first to demonstrate the power of ‘one’. There have been others as well.Like ‘Mountain Man’ Dasrath Majhi who took 22 years to single-handedly carved out a 110-metre passage through the Gehlaur hill in 1982 that reduced the distance between Atri and Wazirganj blocks of Gaya district from 75 km to just 1 km. Or Daitari Nayak of Keonjhar district who carved a 3-km-long canal through a mountain and Jalandhar Nayak, also in Odisha, who constructed a 15-km road to connect his village Gumsahi to the main road in Kandhamal district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-refused-so-odisha-man-built-3-km-road-through-hills-he-took-30-years-101628096626248.html

India currently has air bubble arrangements with 28 countries around the world, ranging from Afghanistan to Uzbekistan. In West Asia, such arrangements have been finalised with Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Saudi Arabia is home to about 2.6 million Indian nationals, one of the largest concentrations of expatriates in West Asia. About nine million Indians live in the Gulf states, a majority of them workers and professionals. In a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, Muraleedharan said: “Government has discussed finalisation of a draft air bubble arrangement with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which would enable people from both countries to undertake travel between India and Saudi Arabia during the Covid-19 pandemic.” Since Saudi Arabia suspended the entry of incoming passengers from India due to the pandemic, negotiations on the air bubble arrangement are “currently on hold”, he said. “The issue continues to be taken up by the government with Saudi Arabia,” Muraleedharan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-has-discussed-air-bubble-with-saudi-arabia-government-101628094945655.html

The road is at the height of 19,300 feet and it passes through Umlingla Pass in Eastern Ladakh. It is a black-topped, 52-kilometre road which connects many important towns in the Chumar sector of Eastern Ladakh, the ministry said in a statement. As the ministry said, the altitude of this road is higher than the base camps of Mount Everest as the South Base Camp in Nepal is situated at an altitude of 17,598 ft, while the North Base Camp in Tibet is at 16,900 feet. This road is much above the altitude of Siachen Glacier which is at 17,700 ft.The road offers an alternative direct route connecting Chisumle and Demchok from Leh and will be of great significance to promote tourism in Ladakh."Infrastructure development in such harsh and tough terrain is extremely challenging. During the winter, the temperature dips to -40 degrees and the oxygen level at this altitude is almost 50 per cent less than at normal places. The BRO has achieved the feat due to the grit and resilience of its personnel who work in treacherous terrain and extreme weather conditions," the defence ministry said in its statement.The project was underway since 2017 and now, four days ago, the blacktopping has been done, marking the completion of the project. The road is at a very strategic point as the villages that will be connected by the road are very close to the India-China border in the eastern sector. This road was constructed under Project Himank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/this-road-at-19-300-ft-in-ladakh-is-world-s-highest-motorable-road-101628093907305.html

On Wednesday, the Centre wrote to all states to actively consider imposing local restrictions in public observation of occasions like Muharram, Onam, Janmashtami, Ganesh Chaturthi and Durga Puja.These occasions are lined up from August to October starting with Muharram on August 19, Janmashtami on August 30, Ganesh Chaturthi on September 10 and Durga Puja between October 5 and October 15. "Indian Council of Medical Research and National Centre for Disease Control have expressed concern regarding the potential mass gathering events during festivals turning into superspreader events, thereby, leading to a spike in Covid cases...I would like to reiterate that any laxity in ensuring strict adherence to the five-fold strategy of test-track-treat-vaccinate and ensure Covid appropriate behaviour may result in losing the impetus that our country has gained so far in managing the pandemic," health secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote to the chief secretaries of all states.Though the Covid-19 situation is steadily improving in India, the second wave of the pandemic which reached its peak in May is not yet over as several states are reporting a rise either in the number of fresh infections or in the positivity rate, the Centre warned earlier.The Centre has sent its team to Kerala to probe into the rise of the cases.

The remaining ₹63 crore has been spent on the Central Vista Avenue, being redeveloped at an estimated cost of ₹608 crore, it added.The government response was to a question by Rajya Sabha members G C Chandrashekhar and Rajmani Patel, who wanted to know the total estimated cost of the Central Vista redevelopment project and the expected number of years to complete it. They also wanted to know the cost of demolition of old structures and the estimated costs to be incurred on the Central Vista redevelopment project for the financial year 2021-22.Minister of state of housing and urban affairs Kaushal Kishore said, “Under the Central Vista Redevelopment/ Development Master Plan, only 2 projects viz. construction of New Parliament Building and Redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue are being implemented, as on date.” The minister added that the estimated expenditure on these two projects over financial year 2021-2022 was ₹1,289 crore.He added that the estimated cost of razing down existing structures “has not been worked out separately.”Regarding the time taken for completion, the minister said the Central Vista Avenue was to be completed by November this year while the new parliament building will be completed in October next year.While the government mentioned the cost of two specific projects, the revamp of the Rajpath and associated new constructions in the area will see the establishment of a new SPG (special protection group) building, vice president’s enclave, Central conference center, ten common secretariat buildings and an automated people mover which will serve as a transit system to ferry employees to these ten secretariat buildings during peak hours.

04-08-2021||India||'Covid recovered people with Covishield jabs safer against Delta variant': Study||With more than 100 countries across the globe affected by the highly transmissible and more virulent Delta variant of Covid-19, a question that remains is who is protected against the strain. A recent study conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune, has found that those who recovered from the virus and have been administered with both doses of Covishield have higher immunity against the Delta variant.For the study titled ‘Neutralization of Delta Variant with Sera of Covishield Vaccines and Covid-19 Recovered Vaccinated Individuals,’ neutralising antibody (NAb) responses of three types of people were accessed.1. Individuals who were inoculated with two doses of Covishield.2. Coronavirus-recovered individuals who were administered both doses of Covishield3. Covid-19 recovered individuals who had contracted breakthrough infections such as Kappa and the Delta variants.The study findings discovered that Covid-19 recovered individuals and the breakthrough cases had “relatively higher neutralising responses against the Delta variant in comparison to the participants who administered either one or two doses of Covishield.”A comparative assessment of Covishield vaccinated individuals’ sera (n=116) in different categories was performed against the prototype strain B.1 (D614G) and the Delta variant of Covid-19. Moreover, under this study, sera was classified into five categories – 1. One dose (n=31), 2. Two doses (n=31), 3. Covid-19 recovered and inoculated with one vaccine dose (n=15), 4. Covid-19 recovered and vaccinated with both jabs (n=19), and 5. Breakthrough coronavirus cases (n=20).The sera from the first four categories were collected from the individuals after four weeks of their vaccination. On the other hand, the sera from the participants of the “breakthrough cases” of coronavirus category was sampled two weeks following their inoculation, the study report stated.Findings revealed that NAbs in individuals with breakthrough cases, and those recovered from Covid-19, with single or both doses of Covishield, had relatively higher protection against the Delta variant of the virus as opposed to those who only took at least one or both doses of vaccine.Notably, it is a test that gauges the presence and number of antibodies in a person’s blood.Meanwhile, in a recent ICMR study, it has been found that India’s first indigenous anti-Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin, is effective against the Delta Plus variant of the virus – a subtype of the Delta variant. Last week, Union science and technology minister Jitendra Singh said that as many as 70 cases of Delta Plus variant were detected by INSACOG, a cluster of labs that do genome sequencing.The World Health Organisation (WHO) also warned against the rapidly spreading Delta variant across the globe, and said that it is expected to become the dominant variant amongst all other variants of concern.(With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-recovered-people-with-one-or-both-doses-of-covishield-are-safer-against-101628082546283.html
04-08-2021||India||Aircraft carrier Vikrant sets sail for sea trials||India’s first indigenous aircraft carrier (IAC) Vikrant, the largest warship to be built in the country with specialised cabins for women officers, set sail on Wednesday for crucial sea trials ahead of its planned induction into the Indian Navy in less than a year, the navy announced on Wednesday.Vikrant has put India in a select league with only the US, the UK, Russia, France and China having the capability to build aircraft carriers.“Most of the ship’s construction activities have been completed and it has entered the trials phase. Readiness of ship’s propulsion and power generation equipment/systems were tested in harbour as part of basin trials in November 2020,” the navy said in a statement.India currently operates a solitary aircraft carrier, INS Vikramaditya, bought second-hand from Russia for $2.33 billion. In contrast, China operates two aircraft carriers — CV-16 Liaoning and CV-17 Shandong. It is building a third carrier as it expands its footprint in the Indian Ocean Region.Designed by the Indian Navy’s Directorate of Naval Design (DND), Vikrant has been built at the state-owned Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL).The warship, with a displacement of 37,500 tonnes, will operate MiG-29K fighter jets, Kamov-31 helicopters, MH-60R multi-role helicopters and the indigenous advanced light helicopters. It has been named after aircraft carrier INS Vikrant operated by the Indian Navy from 1961 to 1997.“IAC is a shining example of the nation’s quest for ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ with more than 76% indigenous content. This is the maiden attempt of the Indian Navy and CSL to indigenously design and build an aircraft carrier… Around 550 Indian firms, including about 100 MSMEs are registered with CSL, and are providing various services for construction of IAC,” the statement said.After Vikrant is commissioned into the navy, India will have two aircraft carriers --- one each for the western and eastern seaboards and that will mark a quantum jump in maritime capabilities, said former navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash (retd).“It’s a huge step forward for indigenous warship building. But the involvement of foreign consultants delayed the IAC project considerably. We have to try and cut down construction time. China can do it in four years. IAC has been in the making for years,” Prakash said. The construction of the aircraft carrier began in 2009.IAC is 262 metres long, has a beam of 62 metres and a height of 59 metres. It has 14 decks, including five in the superstructure, 2,300 compartments and it can accommodate a crew of 1,700, including women officers.“The ship has been designed with a very high degree of automation for machinery operation, navigation and survivability, Vikrant has a top speed of around 28 knots and a cruising speed of 18 knots with an endurance of about 7,500 nautical miles,” said navy spokesperson Commander Vivek Madhwal.Vikrant will be the fourth aircraft carrier to be operated by the Indian Navy. The first was Vikrant (British origin) from 1961 to 1997, INS Viraat (British origin) from 1987 to 2016 and INS Vikramaditya (Russian origin) 2013 onwards.Vikrant’s sea trials were delayed due to the second Covid-19 wave. “During the maiden sailing, the warship’s performance, including hull, main propulsion, power generation and distribution, and auxiliary equipment will be closely watched,” Madhwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aircraft-carrier-vikrant-sets-sail-for-sea-trials-101628082283505.html

The 14 MPs who demanded the discussion said that the issue has ramifications on the national security of the country. They also signed a joint statement where they held the government responsible for the impasse in the Parliament. The parties said that the government has been ‘arrogant and obdurate’ as it has not held a debate on the issue.“It is unfortunate that the government has unleashed a misleading campaign to malign the combined opposition and blame it for the continued disruption in the Parliament. The responsibility for the deadlock lies squarely at the doorsteps of the government, which remains arrogant and obdurate and refuses to accept the opposition’s demand for an informed debate in both the houses,” the joint statement said.The statement comes amid both Houses being adjourned as opposition MPs demanded discussion on the Pegasus spyware issue.

The Union minister of state for home affairs also told the Rajya Sabha that 400 encounters happened in the same time period which also led to the deaths of 85 security personnel.In his reply to Congress MP and former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singh, Nityanand Rai said that Jammu and Kashmir continues to face violence at the hands of terrorists who are sponsored and supported by elements from across the border.“In 400 encounters, 85 security personnel were martyred and 630 terrorists were killed from May 2018 to June 2021,” Rai said in a written reply. The minister also said that the government adopted a policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism. Rai said that the government took measures to strengthen the security apparatus, enforce strict laws against anti-national elements and intensified cordon and search operations to deal with challenges posed by terrorist organisations.“Security Forces also keep a close watch on persons who attempt to provide support to terrorists and initiate action against them,” Rai further added. The Union minister also said incidents of 664 ceasefire violations and cross border firing in Jammu and Kashmir were committed by Pakistan till June 2021. There were no reports of cross-border firing or ceasefire violation in Jammu and Kashmir in March.Rai also told the Upper House that 1,948 people were arrested and 34 others convicted under the stringent anti-terror law Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) in 2019 in reply to Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) MP Tiruchi Siva.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/630-terrorists-killed-in-jammu-and-kashmir-between-may-2018-and-june-2021-101628080448947.html
04-08-2021||India||Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru have Covid R-value over 1, reveals study. What it means||The Union health ministry on Tuesday said the R-value of SARS-CoV-2 virus in eight states is more than one, which is a cause for concern as this value, also known as the reproductive number of the infection, denotes how fast the infection is spreading. Institute of Mathematical Science, Chennai has revealed that Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Delhi too have an R factor of over 1. “The cities of Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, and Delhi also are showing R above 1. This suggests a rise in the active cases that are coordinated across widely scattered regions which would be hard to contain,” researcher Sitabhra Sinha told PTI.Eight states/UTs with R-value more than 1According to health ministry data, the states with R-value over 1 are Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Lakshadweep, Tamil Nadu, Mizoram, Karnataka, Kerala and Puducherry.Why is R-value important?R-value is the rate at which the infection is spreading. When a wave is at its peak, it is evident that the virus is spreading at a faster rate. But at a time when the wave is receding, a slight increase of R-value can indicate an impending upward trend in the wave again.What does a value greater than 1 indicate?It indicates that one infected person is spreading the virus to more than 1 person. If this is the situation, then the number of cases will gradually increase. If the value is less than 1, it mathematically means one infected person is spreading the virus to less than one person. For example, if R-value is 0.88, it means 100 infected persons are spreading the virus to 88 people.What is India's present R-value?An analysis by researchers at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, said the overall R number in India has crossed 1 for the first time since May 7.What is the R-value of other countries?US, Canada, Australia have a 1.2 R-value, on average. This means, one infected person can spread the virus to more than one in these countries too.Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru's R-valueTamil Nadu and Karnataka have already been put on high alert after Kerala started witnessing a spike since last week of July. The situation in Delhi and West Bengal is under control. But if the infection is spreading at a higher rate in these capital cities, it is a serious challenge to the states.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-chennai-kolkata-bengaluru-have-covid-r-value-over-1-reveals-study-what-it-means-101628078575086.html

On Tuesday, top government health officials said that the R number, which denotes how many people are contracting the virus from one infected person, is above 1 in eight states and continues to rise.The virus outbreak in these regions has also pushed the country’s overall effective R number to 1.2, which, many say, is an early warning of a growing outbreak. However, several scientists have suggested that the second wave may not be over yet. Gautam Menon, professor at Departments of Physics and Biology at Ashoka University, told news agency PTI that new daily cases in the northeast have not gone down to the levels as reported in Delhi and other northern states."In that sense, we are likely seeing a continuation of the second wave rather than the initiation of a new Covid wave distinct from the previous one," he said, adding that the surge in cases is, however, certainly worrying.Also Read | 'No lockdown on Saturdays but triple lockdown if...': Kerala tweaks Covid rules as infections shoot upIndia reported 42,625 new Covid-19 cases and 562 related deaths over the last 24 hours, the health ministry data showed Wednesday morning. While India’s Covid-19 situation currently seems under control, 13 states and union territories recorded a surge in infections last week, with Kerala reporting the highest number of cases among states.Sitabhra Sinha, from the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, sounded alarm that the rise in R number seems to be resulting from several states rather than any particular region. “The cities of Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, and Delhi also are showing R above 1. This suggests a rise in the active cases that is coordinated across widely scattered regions which would be hard to contain,” he told PTI.Sanjeev Galande, dean of the School of Natural Sciences, Shiv Nadar University, echoed the view of other experts that it is too early to declare the surge as the beginning of the next wave. Galande noted that the national weekly average hasn’t changed significantly as small increases are seen in a few states.“It is too early to predict whether this is indeed the beginning of the next wave,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-r-value-worrying-but-premature-to-declare-third-covid-wave-scientists-say-101628076472106.html

04-08-2021||India||Rape-murder of Dalit girl: Congress slams AAP, Delhi Police for lack of protection to women||Four days after the alleged rape and murder of a 9-year-old Dalit girl by a priest and three other men in a Delhi crematorium, the Congress on Wednesday slammed the Delhi Police and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government for being careless regarding the protection of women in Delhi. Besides asking for an SC/ST commission in Delhi, they also demanded that the family of the victim be given all necessary support. They said strict punishment should be given to the rapists after a fast-track investigation.Speaking to reporters outside Parliament at Vijay Chowk, Congress leader and member of Parliament Shaktisinh Gohil said, “A poor family used to earn their living through rag picking… They had a daughter... who went to fetch water from a crematorium… where she was raped, murdered and her mother was pressurised to take some money and let her daughter’s body be burned without investigation... The law and order of Delhi is in the control of the Central government… Police imprisoned her mother… when Congress leaders reached there, the mother started crying saying that they (police and criminals) aren’t telling the truth... Only after pressurising the police, they registered an FIR.”He added that Rahul Gandhi and other leaders met the family and assured them that “this fight is the fight of all the daughters of the country and not of this family alone.”“If there had been any humanity in the Prime Minister... would have at least met the family… The PM did not even tweet about it,” Gohil said.Anil Chowdhury, president of the Pradesh Congress Committee, Delhi, said that this incident too would have been suppressed like many others, had Congress leaders not intervened.“These rapists had told the family that their daughter died of electrocution and if they would call the police... they would take out her organs… It is being said that these people have been accused in the past as well which means that police had knowledge of them. Then why was it ignored? This raises doubts about the police. Had it been inquired, they (rapists) would have been behind bars and this child might have been saved,” Chowdhury said.He also hit out the Delhi chief minister saying that since 2014, at least 15,000 sexual assault cases were registered in Delhi, including those of girls as young as 5. “Why has the government not taken any step to protect women here?” He demanded that there be a fast-track investigation in this case and the rapists and murderers be given the death penalty.“Also an SC/ST commission should be set up in Delhi … There are reports that this family was locked up in the police station to pressurise them... There are many such cases where victim families did not get any justice from the police. Setting up of a commission here will help these people who are unable to raise their voice anywhere,” he said.Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) reacted to the incident, saying that the police are working to investigate the case thoroughly. Sambit Patra, BJP spokesperson, said that four people have been arrested in this case and justice will be delivered to the family.Patra, however blamed Congress for being “selective” when it comes to condemning rape. “It is criminal on their (Congress’) part to differentiate between states when it comes to rapes… Yesterday [Tuesday], Rahul Gandhi tweeted that a Dalit’s daughter is a daughter of India, which is not wrong. But is the daughter of a Dalit in Rajasthan not a daughter of India?” he questioned.On Tuesday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had tagged a Hindi news clip reporting the incident and tweeted, “Dalit ki beti bhi desh ki beti hai (A Dalit’s daughter is also the daughter of the country).”Patra also highlighted sexual assault cases in Congress-ruled states and criticised Gandhi for sharing the picture of the parents of the girl, saying Gandhi was resorting to “illegal” means for his “political gains.”Delhi Police said they have registered a case and arrested all accused persons. Ingit Pratap Singh, deputy commissioner of police (south east) said they are conducting a forensic examination of the clothes of the arrested persons to probe allegations of rape. Police have already collected the clothes worn by the accused persons on the day of the incident. “Apart from the clothes, we are also getting the cooler checked for any sign of electrocution. We are conducting a detailed probe,” said Singh. Separately, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who visited the girl’s family on Wednesday, said there is a requirement to fix the law and order system in Delhi. “I appeal to the Central government that concrete measures be taken in this regard and the Delhi government will fully cooperate with the Centre in order to fix the law and order situation in the city. Delhi is the national Capital. If such incidents take place in the city, it does not send out a good message about the city. It makes people feel unsafe,” he added. A board of three doctors will conduct an autopsy of the girl’s charred remains on Wednesday, even as protests by her family members and political activists continue.The four accused, including a 55-year-old priest of the crematorium, were booked under sections related to rape, murder and threats, and under provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the SC/ST Act. They were sent to jail.The accused maintain that the girl died of electrocution while fetching water from an electric cooler, but the family has alleged that the suspects hurriedly cremated the body after threatening the family against informing the police about her death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rapemurder-of-dalit-girl-congress-slams-aap-delhi-police-for-lack-of-protection-to-women-101628077182229.html
04-08-2021||India||Congress in fix over picking MLAs for Rajasthan cabinet expansion||Too many claimants for the nine vacant Cabinet posts in chief minister Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government in Rajasthan has made it difficult to strike the right balance while keeping all factions happy, which is also one of the reasons for the much anticipated expansion to be delayed by close to two months now, senior party leaders said.Party leaders on condition of anonymity said the three factions within the party including Gehlot loyalists, Sachin Pilot followers and the third comprising independents and former Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLAs, who later joined the Congress, have all laid claim to Cabinet vacancies. Senior MLAs and ministers said this “power struggle” could further delay the Cabinet expansion. However, MLAs considered close to Pilot were confident that it would happen before August 15. Party leaders considered close to Gehlot said the CM has told party leadership in Delhi that he will expand the cabinet by filling the nine vacant berths, instead of going for a reshuffle. A senior leader familiar with the developments related to the cabinet expansion, said at present, it was not about the differences between the leaders or their share but striking a balance between the factions. He said there were around 100 MLAs who stood by the government during the political crisis last year, then, there were the six BSP MLAs who merged into Congress and 13 independents. On the other side were the 18 rebels led by Pilot, which included two former ministers.“Now, the catch is striking the balance as there are around 99 MLAs including 13 independents and 18, who went with Pilot, eyeing a ministerial berth. The first cabinet was formed with supporters from Gehlot and Pilot factions. Then, the caste and regional equations took a backseat during the selection. But now the by-polls on two assembly seats are ahead and any decision made in haste could affect the party’s prospects,” he said. An MLA of Pilot faction agreed it was a tight situation and there was a need for balance. “If people in the Pilot group are satisfied then resentment will arise from the other side. Besides, things cannot be managed by mere expansion, the party has to go for a cabinet rejig.” Congress general secretary Ajay Maken, who is in-charge of Rajasthan, recently held a series of meetings with party MLAs and state unit leaders in Jaipur, reviewing performance of ministers, indicating a reshuffle may also be among the options on the table.In an indication that some members of the Gehlot Cabinet may be dropped, Maken on Friday said a few ministers have expressed willingness to quit the state government to work for the organisation.The Gehlot government, which came to power in December 2018, has completed half of its tenure.The demand for a cabinet reshuffle or expansion and political appointments to other posts gained momentum in June after some MLAs close to Sachin Pilot expressed resentment, saying promises made to him by the party high command last year had not been fulfilled.Including Gehlot, there are 21 members in the Rajasthan ministry as of now and up to nine more can be accommodated. Similarly, there are vacancies in party units at the district level.The Congress high command had brought about a truce in the Rajasthan unit after rebel MLAs led by Pilot appeared to bring the Gehlot government to the brink of a collapse last year. A three-member AICC committee was formed to look into the grievances of Pilot supporters. But they claim that this has not happened even after 12 months. Political analyst Manish Godha said the CM was in a catch-22 situation. “The congress has 106 MLAs including six of those who joined from the BSP. The CM would not want a new faction of disgruntled MLAs. Looking at the current situation, he would plan an expansion rather than a reshuffle,” he said.He added that filling all the 9 vacant berths in one go will not be a wise political decision as elections are still 2 years ahead. “Now, the only way out is doing things in the name of high command,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-in-fix-over-picking-mlas-for-rajasthan-cabinet-expansion-101628076581706.html

The cabinet has decided that besides allowing the people coming with RT-PCR negative test reports, those who have been vaccinated will be allowed in the state. Another cabinet meeting will be held on August 10,” Thakur was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The chief minister also said that few Covid-19 restrictions will be introduced in Himachal Pradesh to curb the spread of the viral disease. “It is a worrying subject but the increase in Covid-19 is not rapid,” he said.Also Read| Covid-19: 8 states showing high Reproductive Number, warns Health ministryHimachal Pradesh’s caseload of the coronavirus disease stood at 206,589 on Wednesday, which includes 3,523 deaths, 1,414 active cases and 201,652 recoveries. On Tuesday, 220 cases, one death and 108 recoveries were recorded. Kangra district is the worst hit with over 46,400 total confirmed cases followed by Mandi (28,128), Shimla (25,790) among others.Last week, Himachal Pradesh had recorded a Covid-19 positivity rate of 1.3% compared to 0.8% during the week before that. The state also witnessed a 64% increase in new cases last week as compared to July 19-25 week, Hindustan Times reported on Tuesday.The recent spike in infections can be linked to scores of people thronging hill stations in Himachal in July with no adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour such as wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. The chief minister at that time had said that tourists are welcome to visit the state but urged them to follow all virus-related protocols.Authorities have administered vaccine doses to 5,356,517 eligible beneficiaries till now of which 4,048,894 have received the first dose and the remaining 1,307,623 are fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19himachal-to-allow-vaccinated-people-to-enter-state-says-cmthakur-101628071360899.html

However, there will be a triple lockdown imposed in areas where there are more than 10 Covid-19 cases detected among 1,000 people in a week. In such areas, only shops dealing with essential items be allowed to be open.What are the new Covid-19 rules?In places where the number of weekly infections is below 10 in 1,000 population, all shops will be allowed to operate six days a week. The shops can function from 7am till 9pm.There will be no lockdown on Saturdays.Sunday lockdown will continue, but shops will be allowed to remain open on August 15 and August 22 because of Independence Day and Onam. But there will be a complete lockdown on August 8.Public functions are allowed in open areas with not more than 40 people. 20 people are allowed in weddings and funerals.Educational institutions will remain closed and hotels can open for home delivery.What is a triple lockdown?Triple lockdown is Kerala's tried and tested strategy to contain Covid-19 infections. This strategy involves three locks at three stages. The first lock is at the designated area where a sudden spurt of cases is being noticed. The second lock is generally put at the cluster level. And the third lock is at the house of the infected individuals.Relaxation plus restrictionThe government has decided that triple lockdown will only be imposed in areas where there will be more than 10 cases in 1,000 people in a week. The rest of the areas can come back to normalcy as the present spike in the state is district-specific.Centre versus KeralaTo probe into the sudden increase in cases, the Centre sent a six-member team to Kerala, which highlighted several loopholes in Kerala's approach, like the state is heavily dependent on rapid antigen tests and not the gold standard of Covid-19 testing, RT-PCR. The Central team also pointed out that the state is not maintaining central rules of containment.Health minister Veena George on Wednesday said in the assembly the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic was decreasing in the state as hospital occupancy and ICU occupancy are going down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-lockdown-on-saturdays-but-triple-lockdown-if-kerala-tweaks-covid-rules-as-infections-shoot-up-101628071905911.html

Referring to that photograph, BJP’s Sambit Patra said the party will urge the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights to take cognisance of the tweet as it violates Section 23 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and Section 74 of Juvenile Justice Care and Protection of Children Act that prohibit revealing a minor’s identity.The victim, a nine-year-old Dalit girl, was allegedly raped, murdered and then hurriedly cremated by the alleged perpetrators who are now in police custody. The four accused, including a 55-year-old priest of the crematorium, were booked under sections related to rape, murder and threats, and under provisions of the POCSO Act and the SC/ST Act. The accused maintain that the girl died of electrocution while fetching water from an electric cooler. The family have alleged that the accused hurriedly cremated the body after threatening them.Also Read | Delhi CM Kejriwal orders magisterial probe into rape, murder of 9-yr-oldFollowing his visit, Gandhi told mediapersons that he will stand by the family till they get justice.The BJP, however, accused him of politicising the issue.

Citing the case of Rajasthan where the Congress is in power, Patra said, “According to NCRB [National Crime Records Bureau], Rajasthan tops the list of rape cases. Rape cases in Rajasthan have increased by 30% in the last six months. In 2020, there were 13,750 rape cases in Rajasthan.”The BJP leader said the victim (in Delhi) must get justice, but so should those victims who have been raped and subjected to heinous crimes in Chhattisgarh and Punjab, which are also ruled by the Congress.Sambit Patra, this isn't politics, it is humanity, which your cunning leader totally lacks and our leader is filled with. pic.twitter.com/OAaz0FS8DaLater in the day, reacting to BJP allegations, Youth Congress leader Srivatsa tweeted, “Sambit Patra, this isn’t politics, it is humanity, which your cunning leader totally lacks and our leader is filled with.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-politicising-rape-murder-of-dalit-girl-in-delhibjp-101628070040723.html
04-08-2021||India||No plans to tweak Citizenship Amendment Act: Centre tells Rajya Sabha||The Centre told the Rajya Sabha in a written response on Wednesday that the government has no plans to revise the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) to include other minorities under the purview of the Act.Minister of state for home affairs Nityanand Rai, in response to a written query by Indian Union Muslim League MP Abdul Wahab, told the Upper House of the Parliament that the those eligible to be covered by the CAA may submit applications for grant of citizenship after appropriate rules are notified by the Centre.The CAA came into force on January 10, 2020, after it was notified on December 12, 2019."The Committees on Subordinate Legislation, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have been requested to grant extension of time upto 09.01.2022 to frame the rules under the CAA," Rai told the Parliament in writing.The CAA allows persecuted minorities belonging to the Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Parsi and Christian communities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan to avail Indian citizenship.People belonging to these communities who arrived in India till December 31, 2014, owing to religious persecution in these three countries will not be treated as illegal migrants but will be provided with Indian citizenship, according to the provisions of the act.Earlier this year, Union home minister Amit Shah said the Centre would enforce the CAA after the drive for vaccination against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is over. The amended citizenship Act faced fierce protests against its implementation from opposition political parties and citizens' groups across the country soon after it was notified.The opponents of CAA are of the view that the amended citizenship law coupled with the Centre's National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise is intended to target Muslims living in India, a charge that the Bharatiya Janata Party government have attempted to discredit.Speaking at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that the CAA would ensure access to a secured future to persecuted minorities and stressed that the law would not snatch anyone’s citizenship.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/citizenship-amendment-act-minorities-mha-reply-in-rajya-sabha-101628067272120.html

04-08-2021||India||Central teams review Covid-19 crisis in Kerala; suggest tracing, containment||The central teams which were recently sent to Kerala to review the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crisis in the state suggested enhanced testing, contact tracing, containment measures to deal with the recent surge in infection. Along with these steps, proper hospital infrastructure like ICU and ventilator beds also need to be augmented on an urgent basis, said the multi-disciplinary teams sent by the central government to Kerala."Kerala's 14 districts are presently reporting more than 20,000 cases per day and according to May' 2021 data, over 80 per cent of circulating strains are of the Delta variant," read a draft report published by the central multi-disciplinary team that reached Kerala on July 30, 2021.News agency ANI accessed the aforementioned report on Wednesday and revealed the observations made by the central teams during its review.The target of the central team was to specifically look at areas of testing, contact tracing including surveillance and containment, Covid-19 appropriate behaviours, availability of hospital beds, sufficient logistics including ambulances and hospital-wise case fatality analysis, and Covid-19 vaccination progress.In their report, the central teams recommended that clusters and super events, whenever suspected or reported should be investigated by district-level RRT. They also recommended that "RAT testing at an expanded level should be implemented to ensure saturation testing and reduce lag in the report, the re-categorisation exercise should ideally be undertaken every 14 days, vaccination, the system of whole house isolation to break the chain.""It was indicated by State officials that due to effective home isolation and containment strategies followed after the first wave of Covid-19, the population remained largely unexposed. This is also suggested by a recently conducted sero-surveillance study by ICMR. In it, Kerala ranked last with only about 44 per cent of the population showing antibodies against Covid-19," said the report.According to the report, in Kollam, the Positivity rate is relatively lower in coastal and tribal areas but the bed occupancy rate in the district is quite high with nearly 80 per cent of O2 beds occupied (in government setup).Samples sent for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) were lowest in Kollam among all districts of the State.However, in Thiruvananthapuram as per the report and data shared by the State, as of July 30 with the central team, the number of cases/deaths reported was 331147 and 3229 deaths. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of the district was highest at 0.98 per cent.In the Malappuram District, the report stated, "case detection is mainly through testing of those reporting to health facilities with Covid like illness. There is no active surveillance to detect cases." "The contact tracing is abysmally low with a case contact ratio of 1:1.5. This is more so important as the average family size in this district is above 5, implying even the primary contacts are being missed out. This lack of contact tracing results in an undetected pool of asymptomatic/ mildly symptomatic individuals in the community," the report stated.In Kozhikode District, as per the report, the case detection is mainly through testing of those reporting to health facilities with Covid like illness."There is no active surveillance to detect cases. The contact tracing is abysmally low with a case contact ratio of 1:1.2. The lack of contact tracing results in an undetected pool of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals in the community," the report said.Among those who tested positive, over 85 per cent are in home isolation.In the Kannur district, there are 5998 active cases. The Test Positivity Rate (TPR) is 13.72 per cent (for the week ending 31st July 2021). The case detection is mainly through testing of those reporting to health facilities with Covid like illness. There is no active surveillance to detect cases.The team was divided into Team - 1 for Southern districts of Kerala and Team - 2 for Northern Districts.While Team 1 visited Alappuzha, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, and Thiruvananthapuram districts of Kerala, Team 2 visited Malappuram, Kozhikode, Kannur, and Kasargod districts of the state.The Central teams included the following experts, Dr Sujeet Singh, Director, NCDC, Dr P Ravindran, Former DDG, Dr S. K. Jain, Advisor (PH), NCDC, Dr K. Regu, Addl. Director, Kozhikode Branch, NCDC, Dr Pranay Verma, Joint Director, NCDC, and Dr Ruchi Jain, Public Health Specialist.Kerala on Tuesday recorded 23,676 new Covid-19 cases and 148 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-teams-review-covid-19-crisis-in-kerala-suggest-tracing-containment-101628062579964.html

The dates for the crucial bilateral visits to these Latin American allies of India are still being worked out. Guyana has Indian origin diaspora and has close ties with New Delhi.With India deciding to make maximum contribution to the UNSC as a non-permanent member till 2022, EAM Jaishankar has been keeping constant touch with the multilateral body through its mission in New York. India is also the chair of the 1267 sanctions committee, which has the mandate to declare UN designated global terrorists.The focus of Jaishankar’s UN visit is expected to be Afghanistan, terrorism and maritime security with events in both South China Sea and Persian Gulf in focus as reports of irregulars seizing cargo vessels in the gulf coming in.

Although the exact circumstances surrounding his death is not yet clear, news agencies reported that Ankit's body was found at Jail Number 3 in Tihar this morning.Tihar Jail officials said that an investigation has been launched to probe his death and ascertain the exact cause behind the incident.Ankit Gujjar was said to have been involved in as many as eight murder cases. Both the Uttar Pradesh Police and the Delhi Police had issued rewards on him. While the UP Police had announced a reward of ₹1 lakh, the Delhi Police declared ₹25,000 as a reward for apprehending Ankit Gujjar.Ankit was arrested by the Uttar Pradesh Police back in 2015, but he had come out on bail in 2019. He then shifted his operations to Delhi. The gangster, a resident of Baghpat in western Uttar Pradesh, reportedly joined hands with a Delhi-based gangster, Rohit Chaudhary, to jointly form the Chaudhary-Gujjar gang. They were keen on expanding their network in South Delhi, reports say.Delhi Police in September last year arrested Ankit Gujjar, who by the time had become one of UP's most wanted criminals. Several other gangsters in the South Delhi area had also joined the Chaudhary-Gujjar gang and it was reported that the members of the gang were living together at Neemrana in Rajasthan along with their leaders, Rohit Chaudhary and Ankit Gujjar.Ankit's death is significant because only last month the Delhi high court ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe a case of an inmate named Shrikant Rama Swami's murder inside the prison on May 14.Swami, an under-trial prisoner, was found dead on May 14, 2002, in Barrack No. 4 of Ward No. 2 at Tihar's Jail Number 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ankit-gujjar-one-of-up-s-most-wanted-criminals-found-dead-in-tihar-jail-101628053424595.html
04-08-2021||India||How innovative protests make their mark this Parliament session||This monsoon session has been witnessing protests by the Opposition since day one. While the Opposition has been constantly protesting in the House with placards, there have been some innovative protests outside as well. On their part, farmers have been holding a mock Parliament, just a kilometre from the House. Here’s a look at some new ways that the lawmakers resorted to as they tried to draw attention to some key issues:Driving home the point: On July 26, Rahul Gandhi drove a tractor to Parliament. The vehicle, with a banner demanding that the three “anti-farmer black laws” be repealed, was stopped at the entry gate as it didn’t have a valid pass to be allowed in.But Gandhi managed to make his point. “We have brought the farmers’ message to the Parliament. The government is not allowing any discussions about their demands... All the farmers of India are being suppressed, that is why I have come here on a tractor… These are black laws and they need to be taken back,” he said while seated on the tractor.Back to basics: Harsimrat Kaur Badal, a union minister who resigned following the passing of three controversial farm laws last year, also took to protest in a unique way on August 2. Along with colleagues from Shiromani Akali Dal and Bahujan SamajParty (BSP), Badal handed over wheat stalks to lawmakers to arouse empathy for the farmers who have been protesting on borders of the national Capital since November last year.Click here for LIVE Updates of Parliament proceedings “It is shocking that a community to which everyone is beholden is being persecuted by the government which refuses to repeal 3 black #FarmLaws. Today, we distributed wheat stalks to MPs to appeal to the conscience of our policymakers to be just to the hand that feeds them,” Badal posted on Twitter. She was also seen handing out a stalk to BJP MP and actor Hema Malini while announcing-‘’Hemaji is with farmers!’’Rallying support: On August 3, Opposition leaders united for a breakfast meet in the constitution club in India. Afterwards, many of these MPs hopped on to bicycles and with Rahul Gandhi leading them, they headed to Parliament on cycles mounted with placards demanding reduction in fuel and LPG prices. Taking to Twitter the same day, Gandhi said, “Neither our faces are important nor our names. The important thing is that we are peoples’ representatives - in every face, there are crores of faces of the people of the country who are troubled by inflation. Are these good days?”Earlier on July 19, MPs from Trinamool Congress also rode cycles to Parliament to protest the fuel price hike. Congress leaders had also ridden horses in recent past to protest the fuel price hike.Holding fort: Protesting farmers have been holding a mock parliament at Jantar Mantar. On Tuesday, some of the farmers who have been protesting against the controversially enacted farm laws posed as lawmakers who signed legislation that repealed the “anti-farmer laws” and also imposed “legal guarantees” assuring minimum support price for crops.Farmers have been holding Kisan Sansad at Jantar Mantar as part of their agitation since the beginning of the monsoon session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-innovative-protests-make-their-mark-this-parliament-session-101628054862163.html

Some from within the BJP also reportedly called on the CM, asking him that the Bill be amended as it wasn’t acceptable in its present form.The Congress has now demanded that the Bill be withdrawn. “Why this unusual move to rename the Bill and invite suggestions after bulldozing it in the assembly? Is it hurting the BJP across Goa, across India and overseas too? The Bill has to be tabled back in House. Also, is this not strange to invite suggestions after the Bill has been passed? What mockery! He should withdraw the Bill in toto and restore the faith and confidence of the Goans,” Congress spokesperson Carlos Alvares Ferreria said.Goa Forward president Vijai Sardesai tweeted, “@DrPramodPSawant’s inability to grasp either the gravity or the intricacies of governance is making him not only an unmitigated disaster for #Goa but also a laughingstock across the country. Decisions that have far reaching consequences for #Goemkars are treated as child play!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-govt-seeks-suggestions-on-bhumiputra-bill-already-passed-in-assembly-101628051678526.html
04-08-2021||India||42,625 new Covid-19 cases take India's tally to 31,769,132; 562 new deaths added||India's tally of daily coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases increased again on Wednesday after 42,625 new cases were recorded in the last 24 hours, the Union health ministry update showed. This is at least 12,000 cases more from Tuesday's tally of 30,549.Today's cases took the total number of positive cases in the country to 31,769,132, the health ministry update at 8am showed. India also recorded 562 fatalities in the last 24 hours, taking the death toll from the start of pandemic to 425,757.India has 410,353 active cases in the country, accounting for 1.28 per cent of the total cases seen so far. The active cases have increased by 5,395 in the last 24 hours. Additionally, 36,668 people recovered from the viral disease on Wednesday, taking the national recovery rate to 97.38. A total of 30,933,022 people have recovered from the disease so far.The increase in daily cases recorded by the health ministry comes amid a warning by the government that the pandemic and the second wave are not over yet. At least eight states in the country have a reproduction number over 1, which means the outbreak is expanding and a growing outbreak is possible at this stage, the health ministry said on Tuesday. Reproduction number - also known as the effective R-number - denotes, on average, how many people each infected person is passing the virus to. This figure should remain under 1 for a disease outbreak to be called under control.In what has been a second concern for the authorities, the daily Covid-19 infections in India have started soaring again after a steady decline of nearly three months. At present, the spike is driven by states like Kerala, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh where the cases are increasing.Officials from the health ministry said on Tuesday that the second wave is not over in the country yet as India is still reporting more than 30,000 cases per day.“These cases are being reported from limited areas but when activities were opened up, there were some areas where Covid-19 safe behaviour wasn’t followed and there could be an increase in cases," Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union ministry of health said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/42625-new-covid-19-cases-take-india-s-tally-to-31-769-132-death-toll-at-562-101628043523683.html

The state's home minister Narottam Mishra has announced that he will personally visit the flood-affected areas in the Datia district on Wednesday to take stock of the ground situation."Due to heavy rains in the Gwalior-Chambal region, a number of districts are reeling under flood," the Madhya Pradesh home minister tweeted from his official handle on the microblogging website. "Several villages in the Datia district have also been affected by floods. I am going to personally visit this region today to take stock of the ground situation myself. On Wednesday, I will review the situation in the flood-hit villages of the district."As many as 1,171 villages in the Gwalior-Chambal region of Madhya Pradesh have been affected due to excessive rainfall, according to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. In the case of the Shivpuri and Sheopur districts of the state, an "unprecedented" 800mm rainfall in the past 24 hours resulted in flooding, Chouhan said while speaking to reporters earlier on Tuesday.Notably, the Indian Army has been helping out with relief operations in the districts of Shivpuri, Sheopur, Gwalior, and Datia, according to state additional chief secretary (Home) Rajesh Rajora. He said that despite the bad weather, the Indian Air Force (IAF) conducted as many as four sorties on Tuesday to rescue stranded people from the flood-hit areas.Three people were stranded atop a tree for about 24 hours in the Beechi village, while five others were reported to be stranded at Piproudha in the flood-hit Shivpuri district, it was reported earlier in the day.

04-08-2021||India||HC strikes down TN amendment banning poker, rummy games||In a shot in the arm for online games, the Madras high court on Tuesday struck down an amendment made to the Tamil Nadu Gaming Act, which banned online games including online rummy and online poker with stakes. The previous AIADMK government had brought in an ordinance in November 2020 later adopted as the Amendment Act, which the court said ultra vires the Constitution. The first bench, comprising Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, said that by imposing a wide-ranging blanket ban, the state has completely failed to meet the “least intrusive” measure test and, therefore, the impugned amendment falls foul of Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.The bench passed the orders on a batch of pleas moved by online gaming companies challenging the amendment. The court said that the legislation “has to be regarded as something done by the legislature capriciously, irrationally and without adequate determining principle such that it is excessive and disproportionate…”The court also drew in international sportspersons to make the distinction in skills of playing sports and games physically on the field, board games such as cards and scrabble and playing in cyberspace. “It is true that Arnold Palmer or Severiano Ballesteros may never have mastered how golf is played on the computer or Messi or Ronaldo may be outplayed by a team of infants in a virtual game of football, but Viswanathan Anand or Omar Sharif would not be so disadvantaged when playing their chosen games of skill on the virtual mode,” the court said. “Such distinction is completely lost in the Amending Act as the original scheme in the Act of 1930 of confining gaming to games of chance has been turned upside down and all games outlawed if played for a stake or for any prize.”“There appears to be a little doubt that both rummy and poker are games of skill as they involve considerable memory, working out of percentages, the ability to follow the cards on the table and constantly adjust to the changing possibilities of the unseen cards,” the court said. The bench added that though Poker may not have been recognised in any previous judgment in India to be a game of skill, an American case even convinced the Law Commission to accept poker as a game of skill in its 276th Report. The petitioners contended that these were games of skill and not of chance while the previous government brought in the amendment on account that teenagers and young adults were losing their money while playing online betting games which had also led to suicides. “All that can be said is that the Amending Act is so unequivocally audacious that it rules out any element of choice that an individual may exercise,” the court said adding that some regulation can still be exercised. The All India Gaming Federation, an apex industry body whose self-regulation charter includes Fantasy Sports, Online Poker, Rummy, welcomed the judgment. “It iterates that the Court is not against online gaming, and calls for the government to devise a regulatory framework to provide clarity to the sunrise online gaming industry with a view to encourage investments leading to technological advancements as well as generation of revenue and employment,” said Roland Landers, CEO, All India Gaming Federation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-strikes-down-tn-amendment-banning-poker-rummy-games-101628019454652.html
04-08-2021||India||Hyderabad encounter: SC grants 6 more months for panel to submit report||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave another six months to a three-member inquiry commission, headed by former apex court judge V S Sirpurkar, to finalise its report on the circumstances leading to the encounter killing of four accused in the gang-rape and murder of a veterinarian in Hyderabad in 2019. A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India N V Ramana, however, expressed displeasure at the pendency of the judicial inquiry which was initiated in December 2019. “Why is this matter going on and on? This can be done in three to four months. Is it necessary to inquire 130-140 witnesses?” the bench, which also included justice Surya Kant, asked.On a request by commission’s lawyer K Parameshwar, the bench pointed out that another commission, headed by former top court judge B S Chauhan, to look into the encounter killing of Uttar Pradesh gangster Vikas Dubey in July 2020 had already concluded its inquiry and submitted a report. “Why is this then taking so much time?” the court asked. Parameshwar, on his part, replied that the inquiry could not be completed due to the Covid-19 pandemic that stopped the commission from conducting physical hearings and examining witnesses in person. Reluctantly, the bench gave another extension to the commission for the third time. The previous two extensions of six months each were granted in July 2020 and January 2021. The panel, which also comprised retired Bombay high court judge Rekha Baldota and former Central Bureau of Investigation director DR Karthikeyan, was initially directed in December 2019 to wrap up its inquiry in six months. Mohammed Arif, Chintakunta Chennakeshavulu, Jolu Shiva and Jollu Naveen, who were arrested in connection with the rape and murder of the 27-year-old veterinarian in Hyderabad on November 27, 2019, were shot dead in an alleged encounter at the site of the offence in Hyderabad a month later.According to the police, the accused were taken to the spot to recreate the scene of crime when they tried to flee after snatching weapons from the police personnel. All four were killed when the police fired on them.Advocates GS Mani and Pradeep Sharma had filed petitions in the court, demanding an independent investigation into the incident, following which the judicial commission was set up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-encounter-sc-grants-6-more-months-for-panel-to-submit-report-101628019394680.html
04-08-2021||India||‘Procreate more, win big rewards’: Kerala Catholic commission sends out message to believers||The dwindling numbers of the Christian population in Kerala have prompted the Catholic churches to dust off an old slogan -- “procreate more and win rewards”. The clergy is tightening its grip on believers and all churches have been asked to redraw their pro-life and family commission activities by the family commission wing of the Kerala Catholic Bishops Conference (KCBC) to send the message across -- big is better. Catholics form about 60 per cent of the Christian population in the state. According to the 2011 census, the Christian population in Kerala is 18.38% – a two per cent drop from the earlier census, and its numbers are declining after every census.Pala diocese in Kottayam was first to make an offer last week – it announced a ₹1500 monthly bonanza for those who have got married after 2000 and have four children and above. The icing on the cake is free education and medical care for siblings and parents, with the church controlling a lion’s share of educational institutions and hospitals in the state. Later, many dioceses followed suit.“It is nothing new. We took it up again in the backdrop of the (Covid-19) pandemic and the ongoing year of family celebrations,” said Father Joseph Kuttianikal, director of the family apostolate of Pala diocese, scoffing at speculations that church is eyeing a population boom. The Kerala Catholic Bishops Conference said the new initiative of Pala diocese was part of the family welfare activities for “protection of life” as propounded by the Vatican direction to observe the ‘year of family’.”There is no room for any controversy. We have been consistently telling believer since 2011 when we started felicitating large families,” said KCBC family commission chairman Father M Paul Antony.“There are many policies to support families that receive more children. We have to formulate more such measures to boost our family life,” said Father Paul Simenthy, secretary of the KCBC family commission in a letter to all church heads. This is happening at a time when many states are planning stringent measures to control population explosion, but the church put up a brave face saying it has every right to check its depleting numbers, and that it was part of the ‘year of the family’ celebration announced by Pope Francis. Pastoral letters were read in many churches in the state last Sunday reminding believers about their “family duty and obligation”.The church also reminded believers that sex is not merely an instrument of pleasure, but integral to procreation and flourish. There is a growing tendency among couples in their pursuit of happiness and career options to opt-out children, and the church sniffs influence of globalisation and a perverse view on life for this malaise. It wants Indian Catholic tradition not to embrace the western way where religious life shrunk badly. “The pro-life movement is not to raise numbers only. It is a comprehensive move to uphold family values and cherish the Catholic way of life. It is all the more important now as the anti-life campaign is getting stronger globally,” said Father Paul Thelekkat, former spokesman of the Syro-Malabar church.However, reformists said the church’s latest call was triggered by “commercial interests”. “Our society needs responsible parenthood and not incentivised one. Let parents make a judgment on their progeny, not outside forces,” said Shyju Antony, a leader of Save Our Sisters, a movement floated in the wake of the stir against rape accused former Bishop of Jalandhar Franco Mulakkal. He said the church was only concerned about numbers, not the financial background of the family or the health of mothers.In 2017, the Thamarassery diocese in north Kerala told believers that boys should marry before the age of 26, and girls before 23, while the Irinajalakuda diocese in Thrissur had given an advertisement in local media in 2014 saying that it will give ₹1000 per month to the fourth child till he/she attains the age of 20. One of the reasons for Kerala’s low birth rate is late marriages. KCBC has also called believers to observe a black day on August 10, the 50th anniversary of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act in the country. The church has been opposing all types of abortions, saying human life must be respected and protected from the moment of conception. Kerala is believed to be one of the oldest Christian settlements. St Thomas, one of the 12 apostles of Lord Jesus, is learnt to have visited the state in the first century AD. In its 2000-year history, the Indian church has only six saints and the last five came in ten years, ending the long drought of holy men in a country where religion took roots in apostolic times. Out of the six, four are from Kerala – St Alphonsa, St Kuriakose Elias Chavara, St Euphrasia and St Mariam Thresia. Believers feel that since the laity’s religious enthusiasm is on the wane in developed countries, the church is seeking solutions in a big way. And Kerala still produces some of the best priests and nuns in the world, believers say, adding that a growing number of saints are a bonanza for them to tread the holy path.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/procreate-more-win-big-rewards-kerala-catholic-commission-sends-out-message-to-believers-101628019334687.html
04-08-2021||India||Kerala reports highest spike in Covid-19 cases since May||Kerala reported 23,676 new cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, the highest since May 29, but the spike could also be due to the more than 200,000 tests it carried out — one of the highest numbers till date.The numbers translated to a test positivity rate of 11.87%, roughly within the 12% range it has recorded over the last week. The test positivity rate is far higher than the 5% threshold.The state also recorded 148 new deaths.Officials said they have now stepped up random testing and are planning to intensify the vaccination drive for which they have approached the Union government for more doses. “We can inoculate 500,000 people a day. If we get more vaccines, we can inoculate maximum people. We are in constant touch with the Union government for this,” said state health minister Veena George.The latest serology survey across the country has shown that Kerala had the least exposure to the virus till July among all Indian states, which also means it has the largest chunk of susceptible population.Experts said the state will need to keep a close watch on the situation. “Consistent rise in cases and no sign of plateauing are indications of a possible third wave. As of now, things are under control, and we have to ensure it should not get out of hands during the upcoming Onam festivities,” said internal medicine expert from Palakkad, Dr NM Arun.Union government officials said in Delhi that there are 18 worst-affected districts in the country, of which 10 are in Kerala, with Malappuram averaging a TPR of over 17 per cent last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-reports-highest-spike-in-covid-19-cases-since-may-101628019274707.html
04-08-2021||India||‘Riding an unruly horse’: HC rejects plea to redact name of man acquitted of rape||CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Tuesday turned down a request from a man acquitted in a rape case to redact his name from court judgments, underlining that it would be appropriate to wait for the proposed data protection law that could provide an objective criterion for redaction of names of acquitted persons.“If such uniform standards are not followed across the country, the constitutional courts will be riding an unruly horse which will prove to be counterproductive to the existing system,” the bench of justice Anand Venkatesh said in its order on the man’s right to be forgotten.The petitioner, previously an accused in a case of cheating and rape on the false pretext of marriage, was acquitted by the court. After the verdict, the man approached the high court to seek orders to remove his name.During previous hearings, justice Venkatesh had observed that the accused, prima facie, are entitled to have their name redacted from judicial orders and verdicts, particularly the ones that are easily accessible by a simple Google search.The court consulted the advocates association and members of the bar to gauge the ramifications at a marathon five-hour-long hearing on July 28.Subsequently, the court concluded that implementation was going to be an issue if a generalised order is passed and directions were issued. On Tuesday, the court finally dismissed the petition, observing that the petitioner await the enactment of a data protection law that may spell out the criteria to be followed.“If such uniform standards are not followed across the country, the constitutional courts will be riding an unruly horse which will prove to be counterproductive to the existing system,” the court reasoned.Also Read: The fine line that separates judicial transparency and the right to be forgottenJustice Venkatesh also observed the failings of the criminal justice system in India such as “slipshod investigation, dishonest witnesses and lack of an effective witness protection system” due to which the court sometimes “helplessly” pass orders of acquittals.“This court honestly feels that our criminal justice system is yet to reach such standards where courts can venture to pass orders for redaction of name of an accused person on certain objective criteria prescribed by rules or regulations.”There are issues that would need to be figured. For instance, when can a court order redacting a person’s name. When the first verdict by the trial court is out or when the case goes to an appellate court or the revisional stage. “And how should it be done in cases which have already concluded and become a part of the record,” the court questioned. Unlike the United States, where through a court order there can be complete destruction of the entire records of an accused person after their acquittal and they can start their life afresh, such a system doesn’t exist in India, the court said.Only rules under The Juvenile Justice [Care and Protection of Children] Act, 2015 provides for the complete destruction of the entire criminal record which ultimately removes the person from their identity as an accused person. During the course of deliberation, various foreign judgments, Shakespear’s Othello related to the issue of privacy, reputation were cited. The court also noted a recent interim order of the Delhi high court that directed websites concerned to redact the name of the petitioner.“This court felt that there are certain finer aspects which have to be considered failing which may open up flood gates,” justice Venkatesh said.“There must be a proper policy formulated in this regard by means of specific rules... failing which, such an exercise will lead to utter confusion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/riding-an-unruly-horse-hc-rejects-plea-to-redact-name-of-man-acquitted-of-rape-101628018196722.html

It sought to know what research the petitioner had conducted to show that EVMs were faulty.“Petitioner has read these news items and filed a petition without looking at the EVM machine and style of working of EVM machine which is approved by ECI as well as by Parliament under Section 61A of Representation of Peoples Act, 1951. It is also submitted by party in person that petitioner has done research that neither in UK, France and other countries, EVMs are not used. This is not research by the petitioner but only a reading of news items by him,” the court said.The bench noted that the petition was based on four documents, out of which one was a news item and others pertained to his representation and plea before the Supreme Court, and added that Sukin had no direct knowledge about EVMs at all.“Nothing is argued by the petitioner (Sukin) concretely on the working of the EVM. We see no reason to entertain the writ petition... The writ petition is dismissed with costs of ₹10,000 to be deposited in four weeks towards Delhi State Legal Services Authority,” the court said.The court said that Sukin can file a fresh petition on the issue after conducting research and making proper averments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-junks-plea-to-replace-evms-with-ballot-rs-10k-penalty-imposed-101628017417201.html
04-08-2021||India||Chinese govt confirms Indian student was murdered, 1 held||Beijing The Chinese police have taken into custody a foreign student at Tianjin Foreign Studies University (TFSU) in connection with the murder of a 20-year-old Indian, a student at the same varsity, last week, people familiar with the development said.Aman Nagsen, a resident of Gaya in Bihar, was a student of international business studies at the university located in the city of Tianjin, around 100 km south of Beijing. He was found dead on the campus on July 29.Preliminary examination of the body and the crime scene by Tianjin police confirmed that Nagsen was murdered, the Chinese foreign ministry told HT in a statement.“Around 8 pm on the night of July 29, Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau (PSB) received a call saying that an Indian student was lying on the floor of the dormitory with no sign of life,” the statement said.“The initial investigation of the Public Security organ found the case to be homicide, and the suspect is another foreign student at the university. Compulsory measures have been taken on the suspect and the case is still under further investigation,” the statement added. HT has separately learnt that Nagsen was stabbed to death with a sharp-edged weapon.Neither the nationality of the suspect nor the motive behind the murder — what seems like a rare serious crime on a Chinese campus involving two foreigners — could be immediately confirmed. It also could not be known if the murder weapon was recovered by the investigators.The Chinese foreign ministry said it was in communication with the Indian embassy in Beijing on the case. The Indian embassy was informed about the case first on July 30 and then again on the following day, it added.“Relevant Chinese competent authorities had notified the Indian embassy in Beijing of the situation of the case on July 30 and 31, respectively, and maintained communication with the embassy,” the statement.“The Chinese side will handle the case in accordance with law and offer active assistance in follow-up matters,” it added. Besides the motive behind the crime, several questions remain answered, including the time when the murder was committed and if there was a likely gap of days between the crime and the discovery of the body.The case also raises questions on the role of the university authorities in looking after the welfare and security of foreign students staying on campus.Last week, worried family members got in touch with Nagsen’s local guardian in Beijing after being unable to contact him for several days.The local guardian in turn got in touch with TFSU authorities, persuading them to look him up. That was when Nagsen’s body was found.The Indian embassy has so far been tightlipped about the case because of the sensitivity of the matter.Meanwhile, Nagsen’s grieving family in Gaya continued its appeal to authorities in India and China for help in getting the body back.“Let them continue with the investigation after sending the remains home. We beg the Chinese and Indian authorities,” the deceased’s uncle Pankaj Paswan said from Gaya.An official from the Indian embassy is said to have gone to Tianjin to coordinate the release of the body with local Chinese authorities.Sending back Nagsen’s body to India is likely to be a complicated and a costly process as no passenger flights are currently operating between China and India in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The remains would have to be sent through a third country.Official sources told HT that the autopsy was conducted on Tuesday and the death certificate is expected to arrive in a week. The process for repatriation of the body to India will be carried out thereafter, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-govt-confirms-indian-student-was-murdered-1-held-101628017294536.html
04-08-2021||India||We’re making mockery of judicial system: Supreme Court on pending cases||“Collectively, we are making a mockery of the judicial system,” said the Supreme Court on Tuesday, referring to the sheer number of trivial and miscellaneous cases that have prevented the top court from deciding the ones that really matter to those waiting for final decisions of their long-pending matters.“A common man is not interested in our niceties or the big legal principles that we keep talking about. A litigant wants to know what is there for him in a case that he has filed; whether he has a case or not. He does not want to wait indefinitely to know whether he was right or not. What does he do with a judgment that takes 10 years or 20 years?” remarked a bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy.Justice Kaul added: “In the Supreme Court, I have dealt with an execution case in which the civil suit was pending for 45 years. We are deciding cases that old. Personally, I have been trying to take out old cases so that there can be quietus in at least some of them but we keep getting bombed by miscellaneous matters, anticipatory bail, bail, interim relief etc and there is no time left to decide the old cases.”As on August 2, there were 69,476 cases pending in the Supreme Court. Out of this, 50,901 cases (73%) are miscellaneous matters relating to relief at interim stages.The bench said that there are civil and criminal appeals pending in the Supreme Court that are more than a decade old. “We are sorry to say but the legal fraternity is also interested only in these interim relief matters. Nobody wants to argue the final matters. Collectively, we are making a mockery of the judicial system.” The court was hearing a bunch of cases relating to compensation in motor accident cases when it took umbrage at scores of applications and petitions for interim relief being filed indiscriminately before the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/were-making-mockery-of-judicial-system-sc-on-pending-cases-101628017235280.html
04-08-2021||India||Climate crisis triggered extreme events: Data||There has been an increase in cloudburst occurrences and landslide incidents due to extreme rainfall events in the western Himalayas this year, especially in July, when compared to previous years, according to data maintained by disaster management authorities of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.As per data, this year’s monsoon was also more erratic with the rainfall intensity increasing in short durations, causing damage to property and human life. “Most climate models agree that extreme rainfall events during the monsoon will increase and this was shown in July with heavy rainfall in many places in the last 20 days of the month,” said Prof Ravi Shankar Nanjundiah, director of Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.While heavy rainfall caused flooding in Bihar, West Bengal and parts of north-east India, it triggered landslides in the western Himalayan region. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the rainfall in the last 20 days of July in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir were around 110% above normal.One of the reasons for higher-than-normal rainfall was the high frequency of cloudbursts in the Himalayas. At least 30 people were killed in rain-related incidents, as per the data available with the home ministry.According to IMD, a precipitation event that exceeds 100mm of rainfall in an hour is considered to be a cloudburst. However, there may be heavy rainfall events that may not be described as a cloudburst and may cause flash floods. In July, the western Himalayan region saw several heavy rainfall days.While experts agree that climate crisis is one of the main reasons for increase in the frequency of extreme rainfall, some blame localised factors.“Unplanned road cutting and unabated stone mining are adding to the problem of frequent landslides, even during normal rainfall... authorities turn a blind eye to the damage done to the environment,” said Professor GM Bhat, former head of geology department at the University of Jammu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/increase-in-cloudburst-and-landslides-this-year-shows-data-101628016633309.html
04-08-2021||India||Farmers enact a mock Parliament to protest three laws||At Jantar Mantar, an 18th-century observatory in India’s national capital, a farmers’ mock parliament is in session, barely a kilometre from India’s actual Parliament. ‘Lawmakers’ in the mock one unanimously sign off on a series of ‘legislation’, from repealing real-world “anti-farmer laws” to enacting “legal guarantees” for assured farm prices.Protests in New Delhi by farm unions against three agricultural laws enacted by the Modi government last year are full of colourful acts of high symbolism, backed by nearly 200 cultivators from various food-bowl states.Elsewhere in the hinterland, however, farm unions are preparing to doggedly resist agricultural policies of the Narendra Modi-led government. The protests have long radiated, after they began in November 2020, from Punjab on to Haryana and Rajasthan, and most importantly Uttar Pradesh, a political bellwether which faces assembly elections next year.On the face of it, the farmers have had little success in convincing the government to scrap three laws that provide for freer agricultural markets, allowing big supermarkets and food businesses to directly source produce from farmers.“Aside from the question of repealing the laws, we are ready to talk on any provision of the laws at any time,” agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said twice last month.The Modi government has argued that the laws are important to boost rural investments and farm incomes. The farmers say the new laws will expose them to exploitation by big buyers. They prefer to rely on highly regulated government-backed markets, which are not corruption free, but allow farmers to get assured prices for cereals.Farmers have demanded a flagship law that will legally guarantee benchmark rates, known as minimum support prices, for all produce, regardless of market conditions.“You will see the impact (of the farmers’ agitation) in elections. Please wait,” Rakesh Tikait, who represents the Bharatiya Kisan Union outfit, said.Behind the curtains, strategies are being drawn to campaign against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which rules both at the Centre and states such as Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Farmers from both these states are heavily participating in the protests.A core group of farm leaders make up the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella outfit coordinating the protests that are now well-organised in at least four large states: Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab. The first two are ruled by the BJP.“We are saying repeal these laws. The government is not listening. We are opposing the BJP because it has brought these laws and is refusing to drop them.” Tikait makes it clear that he will work to defeat the BJP.His organisation has planned at least 100 mahapanchayats, or traditional clan-based rural rallies, in Uttar Pradesh. “Lucknow ko Dilli banayenge (will turn Lucknow into another Delhi,” he said. The BJP, which managed a landslide victory in the 2017 assembly polls and grabbed 76% of seats in the recent local body polls, hopes its policies for farmers will pay off.“The political fallout (of these protests) is not very concerning. Steps taken by the government to improve farm incomes will counter any negative fallout,” said Gopal Aggarwal, the BJP’s national spokesperson overseeing economic affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-enact-a-mock-parliament-to-protest-agricultural-laws-101628016632241.html
04-08-2021||India||Covid-19 cases rise for first time since second wave peak||After nearly three months of steady decline, daily Covid-19 infections in India have again started inching upwards, pushed largely by the high volume of daily cases in states such as Kerala where the outbreak continues to expand rapidly. Two more states, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, have seen their seven-day average of daily infections rise by over 75% from the lows seen after the end of the brutal second wave of infections, an analysis by HT shows.The seven-day average of new infections, which denotes the country’s Covid-19 case curve, dropped to a low of 37,975 every day for the week ending July 22, but has since risen gradually with 40,710 new cases being reported every day for the week ending August 3.While in absolute numbers, this may be a marginal increase in cases, each time such a reversal has occurred in India’s outbreak, it has marked a crucial turning point in the cycle.The week-on-week change in the case curve has now been above zero for the past six days, the first time this has happened since May 10 — when the second wave peaked (see chart). A positive change in this number means an outbreak is expanding, while when this value drops below 0%, it denotes a contraction. The last time this number rose above 0% was on February 17, the statistical point from where India’s second wave started.Meanwhile, the national average positivity rate – a crucial metric that shows the spread of infection – has also started slowly inching upwards, and has risen from a low of 2% to 2.4% in the past two weeks.To be sure, this increase in cases as well as positivity rate (at least at the national level) has been very gradual so far, but it is a cause for alarm as it comes at a time when restrictions on several economic and social activities have been eased, and people and governments are becoming complacent.The biggest centre of the outbreak in the country continues to be Kerala, which reported 20,337 new cases every day in the past week, accounting for nearly half of all new infections in the country. But there are plenty of other regions that are either seeing high levels of infections, or where cases are rising again. The states in the country’s North-East continue to see large number of cases. To be sure, cases in the region have peaked , with three of the region’s biggest outbreak centres , Mizoram, Manipur and Meghalaya , seeing a decline in cases.Two more states, however, appear to be taking their space. In both Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, the seven-day average of new cases has risen 76% from the lowest levels since the peak of the second wave.In Himachal, the case trajectory d dropped to a low of 95 new infections a day on average for the week ending June 23, but has again started rising and currently stands at 167.In the same period, the numbers have gone from 34 to 60 in Uttarakhand. Both states, interestingly, have seen a massive influx of tourists in recent weeks as cases have abated across the country.Even Delhi has seen a slight uptick in cases in recent weeks. The seven-day average of new cases in the national capital has gone up 26% in the past 11 days, data shows.These findings were echoed in the epidemiological estimates by the University of Michigan’s Centre for Precision Health Data Science, which showed that India’s overall effective reproduction number (Rt) has climbed to 1.04. An Rt of more than 1 means an outbreak is expanding in a region, while that below 1 denotes a contraction. Kerala had an Rt of 1.23, while Uttarakhand had an Rt of 1.33. The Rt of Delhi, meanwhile, was 1.05.During Tuesday’s Covid-19 media briefing, joint secretary of Union health ministry Lav Agarwal stressed it was too early to say the second wave has ended. He said that whenever R-number is above one, it means that the case trajectory is increasing and it needs to be controlled.“As far as India is concerned, the second wave is still not over,” he said, adding that there are 44 districts, located primarily in Kerala, Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland where the government is keeping a close watch on as they continue to have high positivity rates.Experts warn that these regions cannot be treated as isolated islands of infection as an outbreak in one state can easily spread to another.“This trend of a few isolated pockets of rising cases in some areas is something that we’ve seen before. Every wave has started like this with one or two states reporting cases, then it spreads to more, until the outbreak finally goes out of control... even more so in case of tourist states like Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. So it would be wise to prepare our strategies accordingly. Governments should try to isolate these pockets by forming microcontainment zones in districts with rising cases and stop the chain of transmission immediately,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cases-rise-for-first-time-since-second-wave-peak-101628016511620.html
04-08-2021||India||Best ever strike rate in CBSE’s Class 10 results||A record 99.04% of tenth graders cleared their exams, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) announced on Tuesday, in a trend similar to what was seen for twelfth graders after both board assessments were held on the basis of previous assessments in a pandemic year.The pass percentage was 7.58 percentage points higher than the previous academic year, when the Class 10 exams were largely held as usual except for in a few subjects before the country entered the first lockdown due to Covid-19.The pass percentage for Class 12 was 99.37% this year.Class 10 students were evaluated on the basis of their performances in unit tests, mid-term/half-yearly exams, and the pre-board examinations. Like last year, the board has not announced a merit list this year either, in view of the change in assessment method.The board declared the results of 2,097,128 out of the 2,113,767 regular students who appeared for the examination this year. Of them, 2,076,997 or 99.04% cleared it.As many as 200,962 and 57,824 students scored above 90% and 95% marks, respectively, higher than last year’s tally of 184,358 and 41,804 students scoring in that range.To check “inflation of marks”, CBSE had asked schools to keep their overall passing percentage in line with their best performance in Class 10 final exams in the last three years. The year they selected would be considered a reference year, and the schools were also required to ensure the overall average marks this year did not exceed the overall average marks in the reference year.The result of around 16,639 students was yet to be processed, officials said.CBSE controller of examinations, Sanyam Bhardwaj said, the schools of these students “either did not fulfil the required criteria or did not provide the required information in these cases”.“The board has already opened the online portal for these schools. The regional officers have already started working on it. We will declare the results of these students at the earliest,” he said.Bhardwaj also spoke on why the pass percentage shot despite the reference year requirement. “The increase in the overall pass percentage is because schools moderate the marks by +2 or -2 in accordance with their best percentage in the last three years. So the best of all the schools have together increased the overall pass percentage this year.”The overall pass percentage of Delhi has increased to 98.27% from last year’s 85.86%. The overall pass percentage of government schools in Delhi rose to 97.52% from last year’s 82.61%. Among private schools, this number increased from 90.2% last year to 99.58% this year.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a tweet: “The result for Delhi government schools is 97.52%. Our 186 children have scored above 95%. Many congratulations to the children, their parents and team education.”Several principals of private schools also said they were satisfied with the results. Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, where the average score stands at 82% and overall pass percentage is 100%, said: “The result is in accordance with our students’ performance in pre boards. We had strictly followed the CBSE criteria and the board also did not make any changes in the marks submitted by the school. We are quite satisfied with the results announced through the alternate method of assessment.”Educationist Meeta Sengupta said the alternate assessment method improved chances for more students, not just “toppers”. “It is heartening to hear the good news of a raised pass percentage in the CBSE examination, which not only reflects kinder assessments but also reflects that less stressful modes of testing students can improve the chances of more students, not just the toppers. This in-school portfolio mode of assessment supports the anxious student, the neurodiverse, the less abled and the many others who do well if the element of time and stress is removed, even if the stakes remain high, as they did this time,” she said.Parents also expressed relief. “Even as the school already started Class 11 lessons for my son, we were really anxious about his Class 10 result. There was a fear that the alternative assessment method could put him in a disadvantaged position since he is a high performer. But we are satisfied with the results. We hope things get better soon and he returns to the school,” said Sagar Pathak, father of a Class 11 student at Delhi Public School in RK Puram.Thiruvananthapuram remained at the top of the score tally with 99.99%, followed by Bengaluru (99.96%), Chennai (99.94%), Pune (99.92%) and Ajmer (99.88%).Maintaining the trend, more girls passed than boys by 0.35 percentage points, although the gap in performance shrunk drastically. Previously, this gap was 3.17% percentage point.Students appearing under the children with special needs category also recorded a pass percentage of 99.44%.The Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) and Central Tibetan Schools Administration (CTSA) recorded a 100% pass percentage across the country, followed by Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JKV), which had 99.99% pass percentage.Only 17,673 students were placed under compartment – they need to retake exam in a subject -- as against 150,198 students last year. The compartment exams will be conducted along with those enrolled in private and patrachar (correspondence) mode with the CBSE between August 16 and September 15, since the alternative assessment method could not be implemented in their case due to the unavailability of internal exam performances.The board has also clarified that in case any candidate is not satisfied with the marks allocated, they will be given an opportunity to appear in an exam as and when the conditions allow for it to be held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/best-ever-strike-rate-in-cbse-s-class-10-results-101628016512194.html

The doses from the unit have already started coming in; there was some delay to ensure quality control and optimisation.”“In addition to that, production of 6 million doses has also started at their Ankaleshwar plant that was used to make rabies vaccines,” Paul added.Several government units are also expected to chip in with production of Covaxin. “We may start getting about 2 million doses from Indian Immunologicals Limited by late August or September. It will take some time for production to begin at the Haffkine, BIBCOL (Bharat Immunologicals Biologicals Limited), and Gujarat consortium... Broadly, the activation of the PSUs will happen in November or December,” Paul added.“Final recommendation on whether the vaccine (by Zydus Cadila) is ready for use in adults and children or only in adults is likely in a week, or maximum two. Novovax has also received permission for conducting trials in children,” said Paul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monthly-output-of-vaccines-to-increase-centre-tells-parliament-101628016452730.html
04-08-2021||India||‘Insult to House’: PM; Opposition hardens stand||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday slammed the Opposition for insulting “democracy, constitution, Parliament and the people” by disrupting of proceedings, but the Congress and other parties maintained that protests in both Houses will continue until the government agrees to a debate on the potential use of spyware against politicians, journalists, and activists.At a meeting of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) parliamentary party, Modi attacked the Opposition for the disruption of Parliament and asked party lawmakers to display restraint so that the dignity of Parliament is maintained, even as they tried everything in their powers to get it to function normally.But at a breakfast meeting hosted by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, representatives from 15 parties agreed to to stick to their stand on the Pegasus snooping issue. Later, at a key meeting called by vice president Venkaiah Naidu, Opposition leaders said the disruptions will not end unless Pegasus is debated in Parliament.Since the beginning of the session on July 19, opposition parties have protested in both Houses, disrupting listed business. Some of the parties, including the Congress, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), have demanded a discussion and a reply from the PM or home minister Amit Shah on the Pegasus controversy. They have also sought a roll-back of three controversial central farm laws, and protested against spiralling fuel prices.As the stalemate continued in Rajya Sabha for the 11th day, the government and the Opposition met at the business advisory committee meeting headed by Naidu. The panel decided to take up eight items of business including seven bills and allotted 17 hours of time, but Opposition leaders maintained that the disruptions will not end unless Pegasus is debated.In the meeting, TMC and Congress leaders said that there were three urgent issues — price rise and economy, farm laws and Pegasus — and they wanted a debate on the third issue before anything else. Naidu again appealed to all sides to enable normal functioning of the House. The government managers reiterated they were ready to discuss the farm issue, price rise, and the economic situation.In the Lok Sabha, Speaker Om Birla appealed to Opposition members to restore peace. He announced the several issues related to the farmers were raised in the Question Hour. “I want you (the Opposition) to ask questions to farmers’ issues to the agriculture minister. Parliamentarians who are disrupting the House don’t want to talk about farmers’ issues. You must respect and maintain decorum of this House,” he said.Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said Modi expressed anger at the conduct of some Opposition members at the BJP lawmakers’ meeting. The conduct of the Opposition is an “insult” to Parliament and the Constitution, they have an “undemocratic” attitude and are not keen on meaningful debates Joshi said, quoting the PM.The Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha have been able to utilise only 14% and 21% of their allotted times, respectively, according to PRS Legislative research.The PM is also learnt to have criticised a tweet by TMC’s Derek O’Brien on how the bills have been passed in Parliament without referring to the MP’s name. O’Brien tweeted on Monday: “In the first 10 days, Modi-Shah rushed through and passed 12 Bills at an average time of UNDER SEVEN MINUTES per Bill…Passing legislation or making papri chaat!” , referring to a popular street food.Union minister V Muraleedharan said the PM referred to the tweet as “derogatory” and an “insult of parliamentary procedure and esteem of elected representatives.”O’Brien said his intention was to use a cultural idiom to connect with the people and asked if the PM would be happier if he used the word “dhokla” instead, referring to a snack popular in Gujarat. “I am happy to see that we are setting the agenda and the PM is reacting to it,” he said.The PM has been flagging the issue of disruptions in Parliament for the past two weeks and underlining the need to expose the Opposition’s “attempts to derail the session”. On Tuesday, he said BJP MPs should not give in to provocation, and remain present in the house for parliamentary business.CPI(M) leader Elamaram Kareem said, “It has never happened in the past that everyday the government is clearing bills amid protests. We are demanding division (vote on bills) but it is not accepted. BJP is destroying parliamentary democracy.”Analysts pointed to BJP’s similar disruption of Parliament in 2011 and 2012, and its defence of this, with then leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley saying , in early 2011 that “parliamentary obstruction is not undemocratic” and then leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj saying, in September 2012 that “it is the government’s job to run Parliament, not that of the Opposition.”According to an MP present at Tuesday’s meeting, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman made a presentation on how the economy, after being severely impacted by the pandemic, has picked up in June and July.A party functionary said the finance minister pointed out that despite the second wave of the pandemic, India’s economy is bouncing back rapidly.Responding to the Opposition’s criticism over the rushed passage of bills, Joshi tweeted, “Glaring Irony. Derek O’Brien accuses Govt of rushing Bills & fails to note: TMC & Congress are continuously disrupting Parliament, 13 bills passed without discussion in 1 day in Rajasthan, 16 bills passed without discussion in RS during UPA’s regime, Selective Amnesia?”On Tuesday, the Rajya Sabha passed the Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Bill, 2021 and the Lok Sabha passed the Tribunals Reforms Bill, 2021 and the Essential Defence Services Bill, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/insult-to-house-pm-oppn-hardens-stand-101628016452139.html
04-08-2021||India||Two pilots missing after army chopper crashes in Jammu||The fate of two Indian Army pilots — a lieutenant colonel and a captain — was not known after their Rudra helicopter crashed into the Ranjit Sagar Dam lake near Pathankot on Tuesday, even as search and rescue crews recovered the wreckage of the chopper along with some pilot gear, officials familiar with the development said.The items recovered by search parties included chopper skids, fuel tanks, stabiliser, helmets and the identity card of one of the two pilots, said one of the officials cited above.The Rudra helicopter, built at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), was carrying out a training sortie that involved low-level flying over the lake, said a second official.“If the helicopter is operating within gliding distance of shore/land, life preservers, EFG and life raft are not mandated. Occasionally, such helicopters may be required to operate over water. That’s ‘risk exposure,’ said Commander KP Sanjeev Kumar (retd), a military aviation expert and former experimental test pilot.The helicopter belonged to the army’s Pathankot-based 254 ALH-WSI squadron, which earlier lost a Rudra chopper in January 2021.Locals claimed the chopper used to hover over the dam and drop a pipe into the water every day. The moment it dropped the pipe on Tuesday morning, it crashed, they added.Kathua SSP Ramesh Kotwal said the chopper crashed around 10.45 am. “While deep water divers are on the job, the operation will take time... It will take time to retrieve the entire wreckage. We retrieved two helmets,” he said, adding that the lake was up to 250 ft deep. “The area where the chopper crashed has been zeroed in. Special forces of the army, divers are on the job, but the water is not clear.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-pilots-missing-after-army-chopper-crashes-in-jammu-101628016451551.html
04-08-2021||India||Cop, civilian injured in J&K terror attack: Police||Terrorists opened fire on a police vehicle in the Khanyar area of the old city of Srinagar on Tuesday evening, injuring a police constable and a civilian, police said.“A constable and a civilian were injured in the firing,” said superintendent of police, north Srinagar, Mubasher Hussain.Police said the Jammu and Kashmir Police’s Rakshak vehicle, an armoured military light utility vehicle, was parked at Khanyar’s Shiraz Chowk on Tuesday evening when an unspecified number of terrorists emerged from one of the bylanes and fired in the congested locality. The spot is not far from a camp of the Central Reserve Police Force that operates out of an old cinema building in the neighbourhood, police added.Hussain said the attackers probably attacked from a lane on the vehicle. “We are trying to ascertain what type of weapon it was. We are looking for the cartridges,” he said.The injured constable was identified as Abdul Waheed and was posted at the Khanyar police station.Dr Kanwarjit Singh, medical superintendent of Shri Maharaja Hari Singh tertiary care hospital, said that the policeman “has an injury below the chest and is stable”. Singh said the civilian was not brought to the hospital.It is not clear if the terrorists were targeting someone in particular. In June, there were two incidents of terrorist attacks on security personnel. On June 17, an off-duty policeman was shot dead near his house in the old city’s Saidapora area. Four days later, Inspector Pervaiz Ahmad, who worked with the Criminal Investigation Department wing, was killed near his Nowgam home.The shoot-and-scoot firing on Tuesday evening in Srinagar came hours after security forces in Bandipore district 40 km away shot dead a Pakistani terrorist.According to the police, the terrorist, identified as Babar Ali of Ugda Punjab in Pakistan, had succeeded in escaping from the Shokbaba encounter site where three terrorists were killed on July 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cop-civilian-injured-in-j-k-terror-attack-police-101628016393767.html
04-08-2021||India||Editors Guild moves Supreme Court on Pegasus issue||The Editors Guild of India (EGI) on Tuesday moved the Supreme Court to seek an independent investigation into the alleged purchase and use of Israeli spyware Pegasus in India to target phones of journalists, activists, opposition leaders and even ministers.EGI also asked the top court to order the Union government to produce contracts or deals with foreign companies for the supply of spyware, hacking or electronic surveillance which have been used, whether authorised or not, on Indian citizens.“The Pegasus cyber attacks have raised severe questions as to the integrity of several democratic institutions and the political process. Amongst names on the list of potential targets is included a former Election Commissioner (Ashok Lavasa), several members of the Opposition, and political strategists. If unaddressed, this can shake the public faith in democratic processes, and create a chilling effect, which is poisonous to the health of any democracy,” EGI’s petition, reviewed by HT, said.The Supreme Court may take up the petition on August 5 when a bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana holds a hearing on a bunch of petitions filed earlier on the alleged use of the military-grade spyware.Among those who have already filed petitions for an independent probe are five journalists, Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, SNM Abdi, Prem Shankar Jha, Rupesh Kumar Singh and Ipsa Shataksi, who were reported to be in the potential list of alleged surveillance using the software.Tuesday’s petition by EGI said: “Freedom of the press relies on non-interference by the government and its agencies in reporting of journalists, including their ability to securely and confidentially speaking with sources, investigate abuse of power and corruption, expose governmental incompetence, and speak with those in opposition to the government”.The Pegasus row erupted on July 18 after an international investigative consortium reported that many Indian ministers, politicians, activists, businessmen and journalists were among the 50,000 numbers that were potentially targeted by the Israeli company NSO Group’s phone hacking software. NSO says its software is sold only to government customers. The Indian government has neither confirmed nor denied that it used Pegasus and has ruled out any illegal surveillance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/editors-guild-moves-sc-on-pegasus-issue-101628016332110.html
04-08-2021||India||As vaccine inequity persists, nations eye third shots||Germany announced on Monday that it will offer coronavirus vaccine boosters to vulnerable people from September, becoming the ninth country to announce a third shot for its people amid concerns that the Delta variant could be weakening protection among some groups of fully vaccinated people.Some countries, such as Israel, have already begun administering boosters to people aged 60 and older out of these concerns but the approach has drawn criticism as wide disparities in vaccine availability remain.Only a trickle of the 4.5 billion doses estimated to have been delivered globally has gone to low-income countries till now. For instance, the US, with the third largest population in the world, received vaccines enough for 60% of its population, while Indonesia, the country with the fourth largest population, received doses that can cover only 26% of its population, according to Unicef’s August 3 update of the Covid-19 Vaccine Market Dashboard.In cumulative terms, roughly 3% of all doses have been delivered to Middle East and North Africa while Sub-Saharan Africa has received 1.2% of the 4.5 billion doses, the Unicef dashboard update showed.On July 30, Israel rolled out the first mass campaign for booster shots. Beginning September, Germany and the UK will begin similar campaigns.Germany’s booster drive will rely on the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna doses.In addition to these countries, Russia has made additional shots available to people who completed their inoculation more than six months ago and Hungary has allowed it for those who were vaccinated more than four months ago. France currently offers boosters only to those with weak immune systems, such as people who received an organ transplant, but plans to extend it to those vaccinated early this year by October. Cambodia, United Arab Emirates and Indonesia are other nations that have announced plans for boosters.Activists and scientists have said that offering third doses at a time when there is a large vulnerable population that is unvaccinated globally does little to stem the pandemic. Scientific evidence at present supports booster doses for people with suppressed immunity, but most indicators suggest that healthy, middle-aged people are adequately protected from severe disease or death by almost all of the vaccines available at present.Between late April and late July, the UK, European Union and the US ordered more doses or exercised options to procure additional shots to potentially administer them to children and as boosters. The announcements prompted criticism.“We cannot let pharmaceutical corporations prematurely dictate the need for boosters in the absence of conclusive data and evidence...,” said Dr Carrie Teicher, director of programs at Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders), US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-inequity-persists-nations-eye-3rd-shots-101628016331586.html
04-08-2021||India||Govt to release ₹19k crore under PM-Kisan: Narendra Modi||The Union government will disburse the next instalment of PM-Kisan, its cash transfer scheme for farmers, on August 9, totalling ₹19,000 crore to about 90 million farmers, an official with knowledge of the matter said.Under PM-Kisan, the government provides annual income support of ₹6,000 to every land-owning farmer with a valid enrolment. The money is paid in three equal cash transfers of ₹2,000, once every four months. The scheme was launched on 24 February 2019.In the last instalment paid in May this year, the government disbursed slightly over ₹19,000 crore to 90 million farm households. So far, the Union government has paid nearly ₹1.15 lakh crore under the scheme.In reply to a parliamentary question last week, farm minister Narendra Tomar said that nearly 4.2 million people who were not eligible for payouts under the scheme were given ₹2,900 crore since the scheme’s roll-out. Tomar added that states, where ineligible people received money, have been asked to recover the amount according to guidelines in force.Any farmer can enrol for PM-Kisan by applying at local revenue offices or a state’s nodal officer for the scheme, who is nominated by the state government. Farmers can also self-register through the PM-Kisan portal and common service centres, a network of public-services offices. “The identification of beneficiaries is the responsibility of state governments,” the official quoted above said.States have to upload data to a centralised public finance management system, a platform that auto verifies bank accounts and checks biometric Aadhaar details of beneficiaries sent by states. These are then sent back to states for physical signatures.Meanwhile, in a virtual interaction with the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PM-GKAY) beneficiaries in Gujarat, Modi said that the scheme helped lakhs of poor people during the pandemic. “Since Independence, almost every government had talked about providing cheap food to the poor. The scope and budget of cheap ration schemes increased year after year, but the effect it should have had remained limited...,” he said.Free ration was made available to more than 80 crore people under the scheme during the pandemic with an expenditure of more than ₹2 lakh crore, he said.With inputs from Darshan Desai in Gujarat||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-release-19k-cr-under-pm-kisan-modi-101628016039206.html
04-08-2021||India||Centre says coronavirus case trajectory in eight states concerning||The reproduction number of the Covid-19 outbreak in eight states is above 1 and rising, the government’s top health officials said on Tuesday, pointing to the data as a cause of concern at a time when most parts of the country are recording a drop in cases.The outbreak in these regions has also meant that the country’s overall outbreak reproduction number — also known as the effective R number — has risen to 1.2. The R number denotes, on average, how many people each infected person is passing the virus to. If the number is above 1, it thus means the outbreak is expanding. The value can be seen as an early warning of a growing outbreak.“The second wave is not over in the country yet; we are still reporting over 30,000 cases. These cases are being reported from limited areas but when activities were opened up, there were some areas where Covid-19 safe behaviour wasn’t followed and there could be an increase in cases. The reproduction number increased from 0.6, to 0.8, and now it has increased to 1.2,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union ministry of health, during the government’s routine briefing on Covid-19.He added: “There is an increasing trajectory globally. The US, Canada, and Australia also have an R nought of 1.2.”In India, there were eight regions where the effective R number was 1 or above, and had risen in recent days: Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Lakshadweep, Tamil Nadu, Mizoram, Karnataka, Puducherry, and Kerala.Himachal and J&K have the highest R number of 1.4 among all, the government’s data showed.At the briefing, the officials also cited early findings of a six-member central committee sent to Kerala to assess the outbreak there. Headed by director of National Centre for Disease Control Dr Sujeet Singh, the team visited one of the affected districts of Mallapuram where it advised the state to increase active detection of Covid-19 cases, improve contact tracing, and increase the number of RT PCR tests.Mallapuram recorded a test positivity rate of 17.26%, and 80% of the tests there were conducted using the less accurate rapid antigen tests.“People who get symptoms were getting tested. But our containment strategy suggests that wherever there is clustering of cases, containment zones be created and special teams go door-to-door for contact tracing and actively detecting cases,” said Agarwal.Strict containment must be followed even as the state opens up activities as per the test positivity rate in the districts, said Agarwal. He added that the committee also noted that 91% of the cases were in home isolation, making all household people high risk contacts. However, only 1.5 contacts were traced per case, according to him.“We have advised earlier that it should be close to 1:20. Contact tracing needs to be done properly,” said Agarwal. Along with the containment measures, he added that the committee also suggested that the health infrastructure, especially ICU and ventilator beds, also be increased in places where they are stressed. Increased vaccination is also needed, said Agarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-says-case-trajectory-in-eight-states-concerning-101628015733666.html
04-08-2021||India||Afghan foreign minister dials Jaishankar, calls for emergency UNSC session||Afghan foreign minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar on Tuesday spoke to his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar about convening an emergency session of the UN Security Council on stopping the Taliban’s violence and atrocities across Afghanistan.Atmar’s phone call to Jaishankar on Tuesday evening coincided with a car bomb attack on the residence of defence minister Bismillah Mohammadi in Kabul that triggered an intense clash between the attackers and security forces. Atmar also briefed the envoys of several countries, including India, on the security situation and the collusion between the Taliban and groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).India, currently a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, holds the rotating presidency of the body for August.Atmar said in a tweet he had called Jaishankar to “discuss convening an emergency UN Security Council session on AFG”. The UN and the international community “must play a greater role to stop the unfolding tragedy” in Afghanistan “due to Taliban violence & atrocities”, he said. He also appreciated the “lead role” of India as the current Security Council president.There was no official word from the Indian side on the call. Jaishankar, earlier on Tuesday, said the violent transition underway in Afghanistan has exacerbated the challenge posed by terrorism and its impact will be felt in the neighbourhood and beyond if it is left unattended.A statement in Dari issued by the Afghan foreign ministry said Atmar briefed Jaishankar on the escalation in violence, widespread human rights violations by the Taliban and foreign terror groups in Afghanistan, and the need for a special meeting of the UN Security Council.According to the statement, Jaishankar expressed India’s deep concern at the escalation of violence, insecurity and human rights violations by the Taliban and terrorists in Afghanistan.A powerful car bomb went off outside the residence of the Afghan defence minister in Shirpoor area of Kabul shortly before 8 pm local time. The minister was safe as he was not at the residence at the time of the blast, local media reports said. The homes of several lawmakers are also located in the high-security area.A readout from the Afghan foreign ministry said Atmar noted that the Taliban attacks were being carried out in “direct collusion with more than 10,000 regional terrorists” from Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), al-Qaeda, Ansarullah, Jundallah, East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghan-foreign-minister-dials-jaishankar-calls-for-emergency-unsc-session-101628015372115.html
04-08-2021||India||Lok Sabha passes bill to bar strikes in units providing essential defence services||The Lok Sabha on Tuesday passed a bill that allows the central government to prohibit strikes and lockouts in units that provide essential defence services. The Essential Defence Services Bill, 2021, was introduced in the Lower House on July 22 to replace an ordinance promulgated in June.The ordinance was issued after the Union Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, cleared the corporatisation of India’s main producer of weapons and military equipment, the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), to boost its efficiency and competitiveness in a long-awaited reform in the country’s defence manufacturing sector — but also one not well received by workers in the 41 factories that come under OFB. Essential defence services include units or undertakings involved in the production of goods or equipment required for defence.Under the bill, the government may prohibit strikes, lockouts and lay-offs to protect the country’s sovereignty and integrity. Those violating the prohibition order can be punished or fined, or both.Past records of performance have shown that the OFB has neither been able to produce quality equipment nor adhered to the timelines, former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd) said. “Globally, corporates are involved in the production of defence equipment. And with the corporatisation of the OFB, we are taking the same route to enhance quality and ensure timely deliver,” Jaswal added.C Srikumar, general secretary of the All-India Defence Employees Federation, said: “This is a draconian law that takes away the democratic and constitutional rights of defence civilian employees. A signature campaign against the law has been launched in all 430 defence units across the nation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lok-sabha-passes-bill-to-bar-strikes-in-units-providing-essential-defence-services-101627987050868.html

If the government wants to run this session, they have to agree to a debate on Pegasus,” said an Opposition leader after the meeting.The meeting went on for over an hour, and Gandhi, in his short speech, pointed out that opposition parties represent 60% of India and accused the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of undermining this large part of the country.Emphasising on unity, days after West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said she wants to bring like-minded parties together, Gandhi underlined that “if all of us remain together, the BJP-RSS (Bharatiya Janata Party-Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) would not be able to harm us.”Gandhi also acknowledged that the parties might have their own viewpoints and priorities. “We can always have space for arguments and debates in this framework of unity. But let us work together,” he told the leaders at the meeting.The meeting was attended by leaders from the Congress, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Nationalist Congress Party, Shiv Sena, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Samajwadi Party, Communist Party of India (Marxist), Communist Party of India, Indian Union Muslim League, Revolutionary Socialist Party, Kerala Congress (M), Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, National Conference, Trinamool Congress and Loktantrik Janata Dal. Congress functionaries added that Aam Aadmi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party didn’t attend the meeting while Shiromani Akali Dal was not invited. Dosa, idli as well as chhole bhature was served in an all-vegetarian menu.Different parties maintained that they should continue to press for a debate on the Pegasus issue but the CPI(M)’s Rajya Sabha leader Elamaram Kareem pointed out that the disruption in the House was helping the government clear its legislation. “Their bills are being cleared, but voice is not being registered. We have to register our protest,” Kareem said at the meeting.Another Opposition leader later told HT: “Many leaders want the House to run so that they can speak on key issues. But Congress, Trinamool, DMK and some other party leaderships are adamant on their demand for a debate on Pegasus.” The parties decided they would try newer ways to mark their daily protests every day. After the meeting, Gandhi and many other Congress leaders rode bicycles to Parliament to protest against the fuel price hike.RSP leader NK Premachandran said: “After a long time, nearly all key opposition parties have come together.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leaders-from-cong-14-other-parties-meet-as-oppn-launches-offensive-101627972530333.html
04-08-2021||India||Mizoram says Assam blockade squeezing its supplies||An alleged blockade of National Highway 306 by residents of Assam after a violent showdown last week has left medical stocks and essential supplies dwindling in Mizoram, the small north-eastern state complained on Tuesday.Since the July 26 clashes that killed seven people, nearly a hundred of trucks are stranded at the interstate border between Assam’s Cachar district and Mizoram’s Kolasib district due to protests by groups on the Assam side. The 90km road between Silchar in Assam and Kolasib in Mizoram serves as a lifeline for the state that has just one rail link. The crisis forced the government to ask residents to not hoard supplies and curtail unnecessary consumption.“The blockade has affected supply of all commodities, especially medicines. As of now, we are managing with existing stocks, but if the situation continues longer, it will become difficult for all, especially patients,” said R Lalramnghaka, special secretary, health and family welfare, Mizoram.Assam and Mizoram share a 164.6km-long disputed border. Police forces of the two states fought a pitched gun battle at a disputed border in southern Assam on July 26, in which six Assam policemen died. Assam claimed Mizoram police opened fire on its forces who objected to a road being constructed by Mizoram on a patch of forested land it claims. Mizoram claimed the land belongs to it.Tensions flared up immediately but eased over the weekend after central intervention. On Monday, Assam and Mizoram withdrew cases against each other as both chief ministers spoke of conciliation. But the renewed bonhomie didn’t end the blockade.The Bharatiya Janata Party rules Assam, and the Mizo National Front, a part of the BJP-led North East Democratic Alliance, is in power in Mizoram.On Monday, Mizoram heath minister R Lalthangliana said that the blockade crimped the supply of life-saving medicines and Covid-19 essentials such as oxygen cylinders, oxygen plant materials and test kits.He requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to intervene and prevent a health crisis. The state is battling a recent surge in infections, reporting nearly 500 to 700 cases a day on an average, and is under lockdown for over three months.Mizoram’s home secretary Vanlalngaihsaka wrote to his counterpart in Assam on Monday urging to allow entry of vehicles stranded on NH306 to Mizoram. “The government of Mizoram gives its assurance for the safety and security of all drivers, passengers and their vehicles,” he wrote. Talking to HT over phone from Aizawl, Vanlalngaihsaka, who also holds charge of the food and civil supplies department, said the state had adequate supply of rice and other cereals at present and some supplies were trickling in from neighbouring Tripura.Assam officials said efforts were on to persuade residents to remove the blockade. “We have had several rounds of talks with local groups and requested them to remove the blockades so that vehicles can move to Mizoram,” said Ramandeep Kaur, SP of Cachar district, through which NH306 passes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supply-of-medicines-for-covid-19-patients-hit-by-blockade-says-mizoram-asks-pm-to-step-in-101627929328806.html
