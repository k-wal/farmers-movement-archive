Most of you are tech-savvy and with the use of technology, you can solve the problems of the public thereby saving their time too,” Yogi said while addressing the newly appointed SDMs at a programme organised at Lok Bhawan on Tuesday. Congratulating the officers on the occasion, the chief minister also handed over appointment letters to 51 new SDMs selected after clearing PCS- 2019 examination. On the recruitment process in the state, he said, “Before 2017, the process of government jobs in Uttar Pradesh was vitiated. Casteism and nepotism were prevalent everywhere due to which matters went to courts and the courts then ordered CBI investigations. The youth of Uttar Pradesh got frustrated by it.”“After coming to power, our government ended the predominating chaos and corruption in boards and commissions by expediting the process, conducting recruitments with transparency and clarity,” Yogi added. “Our government has given government jobs to more than 4.5 lakh youths in Uttar Pradesh and no recruitment is pending in the court,” the CM said.Speaking at the event, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma gave a message to the newly selected deputy collectors to be self-confident, reflective and to work above personal interests. UP minister for finance, medical education and parliamentary affairs Suresh Khanna instructed the new officers to focus on their work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/use-tech-to-solve-people-s-problems-says-up-cm-to-new-sdms-101628015072892.html
03-08-2021||Delhi||Dalit girl’s rape-murder: Board to conduct autopsy, protest continues||A board of three doctors will conduct an autopsy of the charred remains of a Dalit 9-year-old girl who was allegedly raped and murdered on Sunday by four people at a crematorium near Delhi Cantonment in south-west Delhi, even as protest by family members and political activists over the incident continued for the third day on Tuesday.The accused, including 55-year-old priest of the crematorium, were booked under sections pertaining to rape, murder and threatening charges, Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the SC/ST Act. They were sent to jail. Though the accused have maintained that the girl died of electrocution while fetching water from an electric cooler, the family have alleged that the suspects hurriedly cremated the body after frightening the family off from informing the police about her death.Demanding death penalty for the four men and speedy justice through a fast-track court, the parents of the girl and nearly 200 people, including local residents, politicians and social activists, are protesting on Pankha road, close to the crematorium.On Tuesday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tagged a Hindi news clip reporting the incident and tweeted, “Dalit ki beti bhi desh ki beti hai (A Dalit’s daughter is also the daughter of the country).”Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said he will meet the family members of the girl on Wednesday. “The murder of a 9-year-old innocent in Delhi after her rape is shameful. There is a need to improve law and order in Delhi. The culprits should be given capital punishment at the earliest. Going to meet the victim’s family tomorrow, will do everything possible to help the family in this fight for justice,” Kejriwal tweeted.At the protest, the girl’s mother alleged that the accused locked her inside the crematorium and cremated her daughter’s body without her consent. “They offered me money, asked me to return home and not tell anyone what happened,” she said.The girl’s father said they will continue to protest until the culprits were hanged. “The priest and the other three men raped and killed my daughter and cremated her body to hide their gruesome crime. We want them to be hanged till death for what they did to our daughter. Till then, we will continue our protest to demand justice for my daughter,” the father said, sitting on a makeshift stage that has been set up in the middle of the Pankha Road.The girl’s mother also alleged that her husband was locked in a room and assaulted by a man at the Delhi Cantonment police station, late on Sunday night. However, the police refuted the allegations. They said the girl’s parents were called to the police station for counselling and completing the legal formalities.Among the politicians who visited the protest site on Tuesday were Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad alias Ravan and Aam Aadmi Party’s Mangolpuri legislator Rakhi Birla, who is also the deputy speaker of Delhi assembly.The child, who lived with her parents in a rented house near the crematorium, went to fetch water from the water cooler installed at the crematorium around 5.30pm on Sunday. Half an hour later, the priest and the three men called the girl’s mother and showed her the child’s body, the police said.“They told her that the girl was electrocuted to death while having water from the cooler... asked her to not inform the police about the death. They told her that the police will register a case and the body will be sent for an autopsy, during which doctors will remove her vital organs and sell them. The four then cremated the body,” said deputy commissioner of police (south-west) Ingit Pratap Singh.Police said the mother’s statement before a magistrate was recorded on Monday where she did not make the rape and murder allegations. In the evening, her statement before the SC/ST commission was recorded and she accused the four men of raping and killing her daughter and cremating her body.“Initially, the case was registered under culpable homicide not amounting to murder, wrongful confinement and destruction of evidence. After the girl’s mother statement before the SC/ST commission, we added rape, murder and threatening charges under revenant sections of Indian Penal Code and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act in addition to the SC/ST Act. There was no delay in police action,” said joint commissioner of police (New Delhi) Jaspal Singh.The suspects have been identified as Radhey Shyam, the priest of the crematorium, and three employees Salim,55, Laxmi Narayan,49, and Kuldeep,63.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dalit-girl-s-rape-murder-board-to-conduct-autopsy-protest-continues-101628014114575.html
03-08-2021||Noida||Family alleges medical negligence after woman’s death||The family of a 27-year-old woman who died following a surgery at a private hospital in Rabupura on Tuesday morning has alleged medical negligence. Police identified the dead woman by a single name as Poonam, a resident of Aachhepur village in Greater Noida. “After multiple consultations with doctors, it was decided to remove her uterus (following several health issues). We admitted her to the hospital where she underwent the procedure,” read the police complaint lodged by the woman’s husband, Pradeep. He claimed that Poonam died during the operation.Police said that they rushed a team to the hospital at around 5am when they were informed of the family alleging negligence. “The body was taken into custody and sent for an autopsy. The family claims that the doctor who did the operation was a quack,” said additional deputy commissioner of police (Zone 3) Vishal Pandey. Based on the family’s complaint, a case was registered against the owner and the doctor under section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder ) of the Indian Penal Code at the Rabupura police station. In the evening, family members of the victim and other people gathered outside the hospital demanding compensation for the woman’s death. “We have assured the family of due action against any responsible parties after a thorough investigation. The group dispersed after that,” said Pandey, adding that the autopsy report was awaited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/family-alleges-medical-negligence-after-woman-s-death-101628014712669.html
03-08-2021||Mumbai||Class 12 results out of the way, students, colleges now worry about undergrad admissions||Results of the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) has calmed the nerves of students across Maharashtra, especially those who were worried that the state education board was assessing them based on their previous years’ performances instead of an exam. However, once the results were out, students had every reason to cheer.Li Shu Liang Shun Ma, 18, is celebrating his success of scoring 96.66% in the science stream and topping his college, Fr Agnel Multipurpose School and Junior college in Vashi. “If not for the pandemic, I could have met my teachers and classmates and celebrated my results with them on this day. I missed out on attending college but have taken double the efforts to cover the portion through online education,” said Shun Ma who plans to pursue computer engineering and is already preparing for his entrance exam.While students opting for professional courses including medicine, engineering, architecture or law, are fairly prepared for the upcoming entrance exams which will decide their admissions, those opting for undergraduate degree courses in colleges affiliated with state universities are a worried lot. Unlike the admissions authority of professional courses who have clarified the next step for students, those aiming for seats in city degree colleges are still confused.“Class 12 students across all school education boards have performed extremely well this year and this automatically means admissions to degree college will be challenging too. My fear, which I believe most students share at present, is that the first three-seat allotment lists across top degree colleges in Mumbai will end at 90-95%. What happens to those who scored below 90% this year?” asked Anubhuti Sharma, who scored 91% in her Class 12 boards.While the state government or the University of Mumbai is yet to announce the admissions process for undergraduate degree courses, principals of city colleges believe that the admission process is most likely to be conducted based on marks scored by students in their Class 12 exams. “We are still waiting for instructions from the university on how to start the admission process for professional courses. Based on the discussions we’ve had so far, merit lists will be drawn up as usual,” said Anushree Lokur, principal of Ramnarain Ruia Autonomous College, Matunga.Every year merit lists are drawn up based on the scores of candidates in their Class 12 exams. However, this year, in the absence of an actual exam and with the boards assigning moderated marks to students, some colleges had pushed for entrance exams. Principals had maintained that without entrance exams, preparing the merit list will be difficult and colleges will not be able to screen students well.“It’s going to be a tough task preparing the merit list this year, especially for colleges that receive a flurry of applications and are sought-after. However, the state government, as well as the University of Mumbai, will take the final call and we will abide,” said the principal of a popular college on the condition of anonymity.Meanwhile, state higher education minister Uday Samant has indicated that entrance exams were unlikely. Most colleges begin their admission process immediately after Class 12 results across all school education boards are released. However, in the absence of any guidelines, colleges have been forced to wait this time around.“Admissions to junior college based on an entrance exam is easier because one exam will be applicable to all students but for the degree college admissions, separate such entrance exams will have to be conducted for different streams and courses, which is impossible at present. Admissions based on Class 12 marks seems the most non-chaotic way forward,” said the principal of a suburban college on condition of anonymity.A senior official from the University of Mumbai confirmed that the university is awaiting clarification from the state government on whether to conduct entrance examinations or not. University pro-vice-chancellor Ravindra Kulkarni said, “We are currently working on a detailed strategy for degree admissions and should be able to issue guidelines very soon.”(With inputs from Ankita G Menon)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/class-12-results-out-of-the-way-students-colleges-now-worry-about-undergrad-admissions-101628014712089.html
03-08-2021||Noida||Stamp dept proposes steep hikes in circle rates, homebuyers cry foul||The Gautam Budh Nagar stamp and registration department has proposed a steep hike in existing circle rates on the basis of which a property buyer pays stamp fee at the time of executing registration of a property. If accepted, buyers will have to cough up more money to buy property in Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway areas.In Noida’s A-category sectors 14A, 15A and 44, the circle rate is proposed at ₹1,94,250 per square metre (sqm) against the existing ₹1,03,500 per sqm — an 87% hike. In B-category sectors such as sectors 11, 12, 22, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77 and 78, which are hubs of middle-income group housing complexes, the rate is proposed at ₹72,000 per sqm against the existing ₹52,500 per sqm — a 37% increase.Stakeholders — buyers, industrial unit owners or developers — have been given time till August 16 to file objections, if any, against the proposal. At present, a buyer has to pay around 6% of the property cost, which in turn is determined by the circle rate, in stamp fee to buy and transfer property in their name. Homebuyers say that a hike in the time of a pandemic, when they face a financial crisis, is unjustified and uncalled for.In the proposal, the department cited the hike in allotment rates by the authorities in Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway areas in some areas. The department wants to match the circle rate with the allotment rate, which is the rate is at which the agencies sell their properties. The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yedia) in June increased the land allotment rate by up to 5% citing inflation. The same month, the Greater Noida Authority hiked its rates by up to 4.5% for residential properties and the Noida Authority hiked its allotment rate by up to 20% in some areas.The department also tied the stamp fee to distance from infrastructure. The new proposal says that if a plot is located along a 30-metre wide road, a Metro corridor or Noida Expressway then an additional 2.5% to 5% of total property cost will have to be paid as stamp fee. “Proposing a hike in circle rates amid the Covid-19 pandemic that has affected the society financially and disrupted all businesses, including the real estate sector, is completely unwarranted. We are filing objections,” said ATS promoter Getambar Anand who is also the former chairman of confederation of real estate developers association of India (CREDAI), a developers’ group.Around 50,000 homebuyers, who were unable to execute their registries five years ago due to the fault of the developers may now have to contend with the new proposal, said Amit Gupta, a resident of Prateek Wisteria Society in Sector 77 and member of the Progressive Community Foundation, a social group of citizens.“We have already objected to the proposal because it is illegal and against the middle-class people who have suffered a lot in the past due to the errors of the state government and developers. Most of us had already bought the stamp as per the previous circle rates but the registry was delayed due to the fault of developers and the state government. We may have to revise this now. Why are we made to suffer more?,” said Gupta.Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway residents said the authorities were yet to provide basic civic facilities in several areas and still want to hike circle rates.“The authorities want to keep putting burden on property buyers without providing them even basic services first. In Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway areas, people are yet to get proper roads, clean parks, proper drainage network or the possession of plot or flat,” said Rishabh Nigam, secretary of Yamuna Expressway entrepreneurs association.“So far this is only a proposal. And we have invited objections from all quarters. If objections are valid, then we will consider it and amend the rates. Nothing is final so far,” said SS Pal assistant inspector general of stamp and registration department, Gautam Budh Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/stamp-dept-proposes-steep-hikes-in-circle-rates-homebuyers-cry-foul-101628014651495.html

The group said the new date will be finalised later this year. SIAM director general Rajesh Menon said, “The postponement of the biennial show (held at Expo Mart) is to ensure the safety of exhibitors, visitors and all stakeholders involved as their safety is the topmost priority for the SIAM. It is in this context that the Indian automobile industry and SIAM recognise the inherent risks in organising the Auto Expo due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the apprehensions of a possible third wave.”Menon said that the chances of Covid-19 spreading in a crowded show like the Auto Expo was extremely high. “There is uncertainty around how Covid-19 would develop in the coming months and at the same time organising Auto Expo would need a lead time of preferably a year. Besides, Auto Expo is like a festival for the Indian automobile industry and we look forward to receiving maximum people with no fear of spread of infection. The new dates will be finalised later,” he said. The Auto Expo provides a platform for manufacturers to showcase new products and technologies, and is closely followed by enthusiasts. Almost 600,000 people participated in its last edition before the pandemic broke in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/fearing-covid-19-organisers-postpone-auto-expo-2022-101628014652039.html

While 98.35% students cleared class 10 in GB Nagar, the neighbouring Ghaziabad recorded a pass percentage of 98.7%, officials said, adding that girls once again outshone boys in both the districts.Overall, the Noida region recorded a pass percentage of 98.78% in the class 10 results, an improvement of over 11% since last year. According to the CBSE, the Noida region comprises 18 districts of Uttar Pradesh, including GB Nagar and Ghaziabad. Last year, Noida region’s pass percentage was 87.51%. This year, the students received their result without appearing for the board exams. The results have been declared on the basis of an alternative assessment method after the board exams were cancelled in the wake of the second wave of Covid-19. Under the alternative assessment criteria, students have been evaluated on the basis of their performances in exams conducted at the school level, including unit tests, half-yearly exams, and pre-board exams.In GB Nagar district, a total of 21,820 students registered for class 10 board exams, of which 13,099 were boys and 8,721 were girls.“Out of 21,820 students, 21,462 have cleared the exams with a pass percentage of 98.35%. The pass percentage of girls in the district is 99.1% while that of boys is 98.5%. There are 183 secondary schools affiliated to CBSE in the district,” said Piyush Sharma, CBSE’s regional officer for Noida.On the other hand, in Ghaziabad, 24,464 students were eligible for class 10 board exams, of which 14,652 were boys and 9,812 girls.“While girls achieved a pass percentage of 99.06%, it stood at 98.7% for boys. A total of 95 secondary schools are affiliated to CBSE in the district. The overall average pass percentage of Ghaziabad is 98.7%,” said Sharma.Meanwhile, students are elated after receiving their results. Samrudhi Pravin Shirke of The Khaitan School in Noida’s Sector 40 has scored 100% in her class 10 board exams. “I was expecting above 99% score, but never thought that I would score a 100%,” said Shirke, who plans to take science stream and wants to pursue neuroscience. Shubhi Bhatia, a student of Amity International School in Noida’s Sector 44, has scored 99.8% with 99 (out of 100) in English and 100 each in French, Maths, Science, and Artificial Intelligence.“With 157 students having scored above 95%, the performance of the school in the exams is praiseworthy. The highest scorers are Shubhi Bhatia (99.8%), followed by Nitya Agarwal (99.6%) and Simone Nayyar (99.4%),” said Renu Singh, principal of Amity International School, Noida.At DPS Noida, Tanvi Srivastava is the topper with 99% marks. “It is a great feeling to secure the first position in my school. It would not have been possible without the constant support of my teachers and parents, especially during the time of Covid-19 when we are getting used to online learning,” she said.At DPS Indirapuram, three students topped with 99.6% and four more students scored 99.4%. Sangeeta Hajela, principal of DPS Indirapuram, said, “This batch of students started online learning last year and even at such a tender age, they have been able to manage during the pandemic and perform well in class 10, which is a great achievement.”Shambhavi Sharma, a student of Gurukul-The School in Ghaziabad, scored 99.6%. “I got 98 in English and 100 each in other subjects. I am happy, but not satisfied as I feel that I could have scored a perfect 100 in English if board exams were held. I will take humanities and plan to appear for civil services exams,” she said.At Amity International School in Sector 1, Vasundhara, 39 out of 142 students scored over 95%. “We congratulate the students on their brilliant performance. Ultimately, their resilience, patience, adaptability and hard work paid off despite the adverse life-threatening circumstances posed by the pandemic. Parents, students and teachers are all very satisfied with this board results,” said Dr. Bhavana Kulshrestha, principal of the school.According to the CBSE, students who are not satisfied with their marks can appear for the in-person exams to be conducted by the board between August 16 and September 15 this year, dates of which will be announced soon.Aditi Basu Roy, president of All India Principals Association, GB Nagar, said that the students have a tough road ahead as the class 10 results have come easily to them. “The students now need to be prepared for the big jump from class 10 to 11, which is tougher than the shift from class 12 to graduation. Based on the class 10 results, which were done solely on internal assessments, students now have to decide their streams for class 11,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/cbse-results-over-98-students-clear-class-10-in-noida-ghaziabad-101628014591532.html
03-08-2021||Mumbai||HSC result: 1,300 colleges in Mumbai division get perfect score||Announcement of Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) results brought cheer not only to students but to colleges in the Mumbai division as well. Over 1,300 managed to get a 100% success rate in Class 12 results, a big boost compared to only 49 and 70 colleges in the same division who had managed the feat in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Mumbai division, which also includes Thane, Raigad and Palghar has around 1,570 junior colleges and almost every year, only a handful of colleges would manage a 100% pass rate. “Since the scores this year were depending on internals and students’ performance in previous years, it was not difficult for colleges to achieve such a feat. We are surprised some colleges still managed 98-99% pass percentage when they could have scored a full 100%,” said a senior official from the Mumbai divisional board office. He further added that colleges, where students have failed, have either been students who could not be reached for internal examinations due to network issues or those who dropped out of Class 12 altogether this year. “The 100% pass rate is a record that most colleges wish to achieve. However, this year, it has become possible for many. Until now, only those colleges with a small number of Class 12 students had managed to boast of this score, but this year, colleges with thousands of students have managed a 100% success rate,” said the vice-principal of a junior college in Thane. Scrapping of board exams this year meant colleges had to use a 30-30-40 formula to assess students where 30% weightage each will be given to Class 10 and 11 marks and 40% to Class 12 internals marks and students’ performance in the year.“A big chunk of the efforts in order to achieve 100% results goes to the teachers this year. Not only did they keep online classes interactive and fun for students throughout the year, but also made sure no student missed an internal test by sending regular reminders to all,” said Marie Fernandes, principal of St Andrew’s College in Bandra, which also managed 100% success rate across all three streams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hsc-result-1-300-colleges-in-mumbai-division-get-perfect-score-101628014472734.html
03-08-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad tops UP’s mega single-day vaccination drive||Ghaziabad on Tuesday topped Uttar Pradesh during the one-day vaccination drive against Covid-19 vaccinating a record 76,931 people, according to Co-WIN data till 8pm. The state vaccinated nearly 2.4 million people on the day, taking its total vaccinations till date to over 51 million.This was the most the district vaccinated till date, beating the previous daily figure of around 36,000 on July 6. It was also the most by any district in the state ever in a day. According to the figures from Co-WIN, Lucknow was on the second spot with 70588, followed by Prayagraj at 60,490, Agra at 58,899and Meerut at 54,840. Ghaziabad achieved the target with 185 Covid vaccination centres (CVC). “The drive has given us the experience to handle more vaccinations and showed that our staff has gotten attuned to the process. Now we will be able to demand more vaccines for the district,” said Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad. The district has administered 1,551,623 doses till date, which is third highest in state after Lucknow and Gautam Budh Nagar. This figure includes the first and second doses of the vaccines.Officials from the Ghaziabad health department said that they had requested 125,000 doses from the state, but were given about 75000. The extra doses came from vials leftover from previous days, they added. Officials involved in the planning process said that teams of Accredited Social Health Activist (Asha workers) and Anganwadi workers and teams of health care workers and even NGOs helped in sensitising residents two days before the drive. “We also roped in schools, community centres that had good ambience as vaccination centres in order to attract people. We tripled the number of CVCs. We achieved our target by 5pm but did not stop vaccinations. The experience that the staff gathered in the last seven months also paid off,” said Dr GP Mathuria, nodal officer for vaccination in the district. Many CVCs on Tuesday catered to over three times the number of people they attended to on other days. “Generally, our centre administers almost 300 doses per day. On Tuesday we clocked almost 1,000. We vaccinated almost all who came to our centre,” said Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital. Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) Ghaziabad, applauded the district’s performance. “It is a major achievement. We suggest that such drives be organised at least twice a week or on alternate days, with a particular focus on high caseload areas, so that the entire population can be covered,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-tops-up-s-mega-single-day-vaccination-drive-101628014411498.html

Officials said that this “rank” was subject to the vaccines supplied to the districts from the state government and could not be considered as a testament of the district’s effort.On Monday evening, The district got 54,000 doses of the vaccines from the state government for the drive, said officials. Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that the administration set up 162 walk-in vaccination booths, besides the 42 permanent vaccination booths for the drive. “We always set the target with respect to the availability of vaccines. That’s why, our internal target of 50,000 was more than the state’s target of 42,000 for us. In any case, we are upbeat with the coverage on the day. People from the lower income groups thronged the walk-in vaccination drive with much enthusiasm. Our figures for the day will go up further as some of these booths couldn’t upload their data on Co-WIN app as yet,” he said. Dr Neeraj Tyagi, the GB Nagar district immunization officer, said that on Tuesday, only second dose of vaccines were administered to the beneficiaries at the permanent booths. “We had set up these walk-in booths in schools, wedding halls, community centres and temples even in rural remote areas so that people who had internet connectivity issues and so could not book their slots, could turn up for vaccination,” he said. He said that the vaccination of pregnant women will begin in the district once the state government gives out guidelines on the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/singleday-mega-vaccination-drive-gets-good-response-in-gb-nagar-101628014291505.html
03-08-2021||Delhi||Hang the culprits at earliest: Delhi CM Kejriwal on 9-year-old’s rape and murder||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday demanded capital punishment for the accused persons in the alleged rape and murder of a nine-year-old girl near the Delhi Cantonment area.“The murder of a 9-year-old innocent in Delhi after the rape is very shameful. There is a need to improve law and order in Delhi. The culprits should be given capital punishment at the earliest,” he posted on Twitter in Hindi.In the same post, Kejriwal mentioned that he would meet the family of the victim on Wednesday and that he will do “everything possible to help the family in this fight for justice.”दिल्ली में 9 साल की मासूम के साथ हैवानियत के बाद हत्या बेहद शर्मनाक है। दिल्ली में कानून-व्यवस्था दुरुस्त किए जाने की ज़रुरत है। दोषियों को जल्द से जल्द फांसी की सज़ा मिलनी चाहिए। कल पीड़ित परिवार से मिलने जा रहा हूं, न्याय की इस लड़ाई में परिवार की हर संभव मदद करेंगे।The nine-year-old was allegedly raped and killed by a priest and three male staffers of a crematorium, who then cremated her body without the consent of her parents or informing the police. The four men were held after the victim’s family complained of foul play, and staged protests alongside nearly 200 villagers from Sunday night till Monday evening. They demanded the arrested persons be charged with rape and murder, Hindustan Times had reported.According to police, the girl lived with her parents at a rented house near the crematorium and had gone to fetch cold water from the water cooler installed at the premises around 5.30pm on Sunday. The priest and the three men summoned the girl’s mother to the crematorium after 30 minutes and told her that her daughter was electrocuted to death while having water from the cooler. They also showed the victim’s body to her mother.“They showed her the burn marks on her daughter’s wrist and elbow, and said her lips had turned blue. The four men asked the girl’s mother to not inform the police about the death. They told her that the police will register a case and the body will be sent for an autopsy, during which doctors will remove her vital organs and sell them. The four then cremated the body,” said deputy commissioner of police (south-west) Ingit Pratap Singh Singh.DCP Singh added that the men allegedly made the mother agree to their terms and claimed that it was better to cremate the body.Delhi Police has lodged a case against the four men based on the mother’s statement, who claimed that her daughter was raped, murdered and cremated without their consent on Sunday.DCP Singh further said that all the four men – identified as Radhey Shyam (55), the priest; and the three staff Salim, Laxmi Narayan and Kuldeep, were acquainted with the victim’s mother.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hang-the-culprits-at-earliest-delhi-cm-kejriwal-on-9-year-old-s-rape-and-murder-101628013558544.html

A gazette notification of this order will be issued on Wednesday after which the restrictions will come into force immediately.The traffic police will act against the violators of the rules.The public works department (PWD) has been directed to install signages at these stretches at the earliest to inform the public about the regulated traffic movement.Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot said the order was in the works for several months now as discussions on identifying the stretches were going on in consultation with the Delhi traffic police.“We hope this will decongest the busy stretches, and also help reduce pollution as Delhi, over the past few years has seen mushrooming growth of small to medium sized goods vehicles. There were no restrictions on their movement. This is the first time that movement of goods vehicles, including the small and medium sized ones, are being regulated in the city at this scale. Such vehicles will have no entry on the specified roads during the given timings,” Gahlot said.According to the order, between 12:30pm and 8pm, heavy, medium and light motorised goods vehicles will not be allowed in and around the markets mentioned above and those located at Kamla Nagar, Gandhi Nagar, Vikas Marg, Mahipalpur, Rajouri Garden, Tilak Nagar, and Dwarka sector 10 main market. Same timings will apply to the markets listed above.On the Barapullah from Ring Road till INA to Sarai Kale Khan, a complete round-the-clock (24 hours) ban has been imposed on all categories of buses (excluding mini buses and RTVs), Gramin Sewa vehicles, heavy, medium and light goods vehicles, e-rickshaws and e-carts.To address the perennial traffic congestion issue in Najafgarh, the entire Phirni Road, Najafgarh (Delhi Gate– Chhawla Road crossing–Dhansa Road crossing) will be out of bounds for heavy to light goods vehicles from 7am to 11pm, read the order issued by KK Dahiya, special commissioner (transport).Stretches such as Pataudi House Road, Daryaganj (from the T-Point at Kasturba Hospital Marg to T-Point Dakhni Rai Street) will be prohibited for goods vehicles from 12 noon to 3pm. There are at least eight stretches where the prohibition will be effective in two phases every day.For example, the Agra Canal Road from Kalindi Kunj to Faridabad Border will be shut for good vehicles from 7am to 11am and from 5pm to 11pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fresh-restrictions-on-goods-vehicles-to-cut-congestion-in-delhi-101628013556112.html

He also issued directions for waiver on fees paid for waste disposal by Ayush clinics.“Health Minister Satyendar Jain met the delegation of Ayush doctors, today... The most important issues raised were regarding the subsidy for electricity in their clinics, the introduction of Ayush in mohalla clinics, and relief from ₹890 fees levied on biomedical waste collection from Ayush clinics. The doctors submitted that the Ayush clinics were small and didn’t produce biomedical waste. Thus, the fee should be waived off or reduced. Jain immediately responded to this submission and gave directions to the designated departments to put this into effect,” said Jain’s office in a statement issued on Tuesday.Jain further said, “Mohalla clinics should be selected around Delhi to accommodate and introduce Ayush treatment which will serve the dual purpose of providing welfare to the Ayush doctors as well as people.”He soon issued direction to the health department to identify few mohalla clinics for Ayush treatments, the government said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-offer-ayush-treatments-at-some-city-mohalla-clinics-101628013251494.html
03-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: After Class 10 results, CBSE students now worry about junior college admissions||Results of Class 10 students from the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) may have brought cheer to students across the country, but for several students in Mumbai, the anxiety is far from over. While a large number of students have already confirmed their admissions to Class 11 in the same board, those interested in opting for junior colleges need to clear another hurdle — the common entrance test (CET) to be conducted by the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) on August 21.“More than the Class 10 results, most of us are more anxious about the CET because the state board plans to conduct exam based on the state board syllabus. There’s a vast difference in what we are taught in CBSE and what is taught by the state board, so it is unfair to force non-state board students to appear for a test based on a syllabus alien to us,” said Richa Chaturvedi, a CBSE Class 10 student who scored 93%.This year, Class 10 board exams across several school education boards had to be scrapped due to rising Covid-19 cases. Results for the Class 10 batch was instead based on students’ performance in Class 9 and 10 combined.According to a circular released by the state board last month, an optional CET will be based completely on the Maharashtra state board Class 10 syllabus. It will be a 100 marks multiple choice question format exam held over two hours. The exam will have questions from four subjects including English, Mathematics, Science and Social Sciences, each carrying 25% weightage in the test.In May, a Class 10 ICSE student approached the Bombay high court seeking help in this matter. The student’s petition points out the ‘bias’ against students of other boards and the added stress for students, therefore. After hearing the students petition, the court last month asked the Maharashtra state board to consider conducting the CET taking into to account the syllabus of ICSE and CBSE boards as well. The board recently sought opinions from experts on this matter and a final decision is pending still.“Most CBSE Class 10 students in our school have already opted to continue studying in the same school for Class 11 as well. While many are still keen to opt for junior colleges, it is unfair to expect them to prepare for a CET based on state board syllabus. The syllabus was made public very recently, giving students very little time to prepare for the same,” said the head mistress of a suburban school on condition of anonymity. She said that most students are still hoping for a positive response from the Bombay HC regarding the entrance exam. “There needs to be an end to the ambiguity and only the state board can bring clarity,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-after-class-10-results-cbse-students-now-worry-about-junior-college-admissions-101628013152074.html

On June 25, Lucknow had achieved a single-day vaccination count of 28,131. “None of the beneficiaries, who came for vaccination, were returned. Some of the centres conducted vaccination till late evening,” said Lucknow chief medical officer Dr Manoj Agrawal, who inspected the vaccination centres at the community health centre in Kakori and at Chhota Imambada. The health department had arranged over 88,000 vaccine doses against a target of 69,000 set by the state health department. There were 373 vaccination booths at 171 vaccination centres in Lucknow for the mega vaccination camp. “Maximum enthusiasm was seen among beneficiaries between 18 and 45 years of age. They not only came for vaccination, but also assisted the elderly and women to reach vaccination centres,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, Association of International Doctors. In Lucknow division, the target was to administer 2.91 lakh doses of the vaccine in six districts – Hardoi 51000 doses, Lakhimpur Kheri 48,000 doses, Lucknow 69,000 doses, Rae Bareli 36,000 doses, Sitapur 51,000 doses and Unnao 36,000 doses. The target was fixed at three times the average daily vaccination target (on normal days). By 6pm, 82.97% of the target was achieved, where Lucknow had met 96.40% of the target by 6pm and Hardoi 96.45% of the target.

03-08-2021||Mumbai||Class 10 CBSE results: Number of students with 90% and above marks rise by 40%||The number of high scorers grew by almost 40% in the Class 10 results declared by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) at noon on Tuesday. More than 21.5 lakh students in Class 10 registered for their board exams this year, across the country, according to data shared by the CBSE. Over 2.58 lakh of them have scored above 90% aggregate marks, up from last year’s 1.84 lakh. Similarly, the number of students scoring 95% and above stands at 57,824 this year compared to 41,804 students who managed this feat last year. Much like the Class 12 results announced last week, almost all students, whose results were announced, have passed. The board recorded an overall pass percentage of 99.04, the best so far. It was no surprise that city schools, too, witnessed a hike in the overall performance of their Class 10 batch. At Delhi Public School in Nerul, 51% of the batch of 239 students scored above 95% this year and 77% scored above 90%. “We have to congratulate our students as well as our teachers for ensuring that despite the time we are in and having to continue school only in the virtual platform, everyone ensured they gave their hundred per cent and this shows in the final result,” said J Mohanty, principal of the school. At Bal Bharti Public School in Navi Mumbai, more than 50% of their batch has scored above 90% this year, an increase compared to last year. “Of the 308 students who were part of our Class 10 batch, 237 students have scored above 90% which includes 116 students scoring 95% and above. Our results have consistently been good over the years and this year too our students have done exceptionally well,” said Suman Samarth, headmistress of the secondary section at RN Podar High School, Santacruz. The Pune region, which consists of schools in Maharashtra, Goa, Daman-Diu and Dadra Nagar Haveli ranked fourth among all regions by improving its success rate from 98.05% to 99.92%. Owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, students had been attending online classes and board examinations were cancelled in the interest of their safety. CBSE formulated a method to calculate and moderate the marks of students based on their performance in internal examinations conducted by the schools. Instead of the 80-mark theory exam, students were assigned marks out of 10 marks for their performance in periodic or unit tests, 30 marks for performance in half-yearly or mid-term exams, and 40 marks for pre-board exams. Any student, who was not satisfied by the marks assigned by the board, will be allowed to appear in an exam when the Covid-19 situation improves. “There was a detailed evaluation format that the CBSE had prepared; it was one of the best methods adopted. Overall students have scored well despite the challenging year that they had to face in their teenage years,” said Muriel Fernandes, principal, Ryan International School, Sanpada. “Initially it was difficult to cope with the sudden change in the pattern of studies. I found it quite challenging to manage online classes but support from my parents has helped me overcome and score well. Due to the lockdown, we could not go out much, hence I played my keyboards regularly and continued learning music to destress myself,” said Shaun D’souza (15), who topped Rajhans Vidyalaya with 98.2% and is aspiring to be a cardiologist. Principals and parents said that students were under unprecedented pressure amid rising Covid-19 cases. “It was a tremendous change for both students as well as teachers; they have worked hard and overcome it successfully. Those students who were consistent throughout the year would have scored well in the current evaluation pattern. Some of the playful ones who were not prepared for such an evaluation process would have been disappointed with the scores, however in the current scenario there is no other choice but to remain motivated,” said Kala Gangadharan, principal, Rajhans Vidyalaya, Andheri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/class-10-cbse-results-number-of-students-with-90-and-above-marks-rise-by-40-101628012732033.html

03-08-2021||Lucknow||OP Rajbhar’s meeting with UP BJP chief triggers buzz||An hour-long meeting of former Uttar Pradesh minister and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) leader Om Prakash Rajbhar with UP Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Swatantra Dev on Tuesday set off speculations about the likelihood of former BJP ally joining hands with the ruling party ahead of 2022 UP polls. Both BJP and Rajbhar described the meeting as “personal” but it triggered angry reactions from the opposition parties like the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) who claimed that the opposition leader who was busy cobbling together an anti-BJP front, was engaged in “double cross”. Irrespective of the actual outcome of the meeting, political experts said that Rajbhar’s meeting with BJP had taken the steam out of the build-up of smaller parties called the ‘Bhagidari sankalp morcha.” “In politics perception is stronger than reality. The meeting has given birth to mistrust among smaller parties that Rajbhar was trying to build together. For the BJP it’s a win-win situation,” said political expert Irshad Ilmi. When contacted Rajbhar, sounded desperate to make it appear that the meeting was “personal” and that he would continue to fight the BJP. “I have known Swatantra Dev ji for long. He is also a leader of the backward community. My meeting with him was completely personal. As for my politics, I would continue to fight the BJP tooth and nail,” he said. He couldn’t explain the “personal reason” that made him visit key BJP leader, and which triggered the buzz of Rajbhar returning back as BJP ally, as he had done ahead of the 2017 UP polls. Meanwhile, interacting with media persons in Varanasi, UP Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party vice president Shashi Pratap Singh said, Rajbhar’s meeting with UP BJP president was a courtesy call.“He is the chief of SBSP as well as an MLA. He may call on leader of any political party,” he said, adding that SBSP chief told the UP BJP chief that social justice committee report should be implemented and free education for all should be announced.Om Prakash is an OBC leader who belongs to the Rajbhar sub-caste which is strategically spread across several east UP constituencies. After Om Prakash Rajbhar, with whom the then UP BJP in-charge Amit Shah had inked a pact before 2017 UP polls, fell out with BJP after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP propped up Anil Rajbhar as cabinet minister in a bid to groom its own homegrown Rajbhar leadership. Former IAS officer turned BJP MLC and party’s UP vice president AK Sharma too had met BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Sakaldeep Rajbhar in Lucknow. However, party leaders admit that they haven’t been able to find a leader of Rajbhar community who could fit into “Om Prakash’s shoes.” This is exactly why the opposition leaders feel there is more to Om Prakash Rajbhar’s meeting with UP BJP chief than meet the eye. “It’s strange that OP Rajbhar says one thing on one day and does something different the next,” said AAP’s Rajya Sabha MP and UP in-charge Sanjay Singh. Congress spokesman Surendra Rajput felt that Rajbhar’s meeting with BJP chief didn’t inspire confidence (about Rajbhar’s anti-BJP stance). Deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, however, cautioned against reading too much into the meeting. “In politics, there are personal relations too. We are closer to leaders in opposition too,” he said.“It’s also true that OP Rajbhar has been an ally of ours,” Sharma added with a smile.In 2017 UP polls that the BJP had contested with SBSP and Apna Dal as allies, it had won the elections with 39.67 per cent votes against BSP’s 22.23 per cent, SP’s 21.82 per cent and Congress’s 6.25 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/op-rajbhar-s-meeting-with-up-bjp-chief-triggers-buzz-101628012072370.html

They drove over Khardung La, the highest motorable road in the world located in Leh district and also visited the Pangong lake on their 125cc scooter. The duo lives in Preetam Nagar colony and Mundera locality hhere respectively. Reshandra, 24, runs a fitness food supplement business while his 22-year-old friend Ashish is a sales executive. Although they had returned from their expedition on July 3, everyone in the city was oblivious of their rare feat and it was only after their video went viral on YouTube and other social media platforms that people started noticing them. Both these friends were honoured by the Vyapar Mandal of Prayagraj for the feat on Monday. “My younger brother, Nikhil, had undertaken a number of expeditions on his scooter and bike two years back. So I thought if he could visit Pokhra (Nepal) and Nathula pass (Sikkim) on his two-wheeler, we should also try visiting Leh on my scooter,” said Reshandra. So, the duo purchased items worth around ₹25,000 needed for their expedition and embarked on their journey on June 19. “We reached Agra via Lucknow on the same day and went to Karnal, Jammu, Srinagar, Drass valley, Leh, Khardung La and finally to Pangong lake. On our return journey we also visited Manali and reached Prayagraj on July 3,” shared Reshandra. Reshandra drove the scooter for the entire route which was meticulously planned by the two friends. While Reshandra would drive, his friends Ashish would keep record of the distance travelled, taking pics and shooting videos of surroundings and posting it on social media as their Vlogs. “The journey from Srinagar to Dras, Leh and Khardung La was very challenging as some patches of roads were very rough. We faced landslides, crossed many small rivers, roads full of boulders and even had to deal with punctured tyres but we kept moving forward with courage. Even the weather was chilly, and rain made it tougher,” said Ashish. Both friends feel that apart from the scenic beauty of Leh, the main market of the area and the products on sale would forever be etched in their memory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gutsy-sangam-city-youths-scooter-to-leh-101628012013803.html
03-08-2021||Gurugram||Tourism corporation surrenders six liquor shops||The Haryana Tourism Corporation Limited surrendered six liquor shops in Gurugram it was allocated through bidding last year. Officials said that the department did not renew the licences, following which the liquor vends were reallocated through tenders last month. The Gururgam excise department advertised in June for auction of liquor in 142 zones, following which tenders were floated and liquor vends were allotted, excise officials said, adding that there are two liquor vends in each zone. Last year, the decision to bid for the allocation of liquor vends in the district was taken by the state government after the tourism department suffered huge losses due to the closure of tourism complexes and guest houses during the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19. During the lockdown period, the revenue receipt of the corporation was almost nil, an official said. Rajesh Joon, additional divisional manager of Haryana Tourism Corporation, said that they had entered the liquor business following the Delhi model but could not make a profit. “This was a small exercise of government and a pilot project, but it did not take off well,” he said. There are close to 400 liquor shops operating at present in the district. The Haryana government last month auctioned 284 store licences in Gurugram district through e-tenders and earned ₹788.87 crore from the auction, a slight decrease from last year, officials of the excise department said. The bids were finalised in the presence of Gurugram deputy commissioner, additional deputy commissioner, four deputy excise and taxation commissioners (DETC), and officials of the sales tax and excise departments. The excise areas are divided into east and west Gurugram, with 69 and 73 zones, respectively, with two liquor vends allowed in each zone. Earlier, there were six liquor vends in each zone. In urban zones, unlike before, no sub-vends are allowed as per the excise policy announced in 2019. The state was also divided into three groups for the process of e-tendering this year and Gurugram city falls in Group A, officials said. In the east zone, the highest bid of ₹19.29 crore was for a vend at Mehrauli border, while the second-highest bid, of ₹19.05 crore, was for a store in Sector 31. The third highest bid was ₹18.61 crore, for a store on the Golf Course Road. In the west zone, the highest bid was ₹20.88 crore, for a vend at Shankar Chowk, while the second-highest bid was ₹18.59 crore for a vend at Sector 17/18 dividing road and the third-highest was ₹11.11 crore, for a vend in DLF Phase-3 (Nathupur). VK Beniwal, the deputy commissioner of excise and taxation, Gurugram (east), said they received bids for 38 of the 69 zones. “We were able to allot all 69 zones despite Covid restrictions and the department has not suffered major losses. There is a slight decrease compared to last year. The auction which used to take place in March was delayed to June. This time, there are many new players in the market,” he said. Dr Anirudh Sharma, deputy excise and taxation commissioner (west), said that they have managed to allot all 73 zones and it was a smooth and successful process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/tourism-corporation-surrenders-six-liquor-shops-101628012012009.html

Bihar State Archives is celebrating “Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav” to mark of 75th anniversary of the country’s Independence, which falls on August 15, 2022, and the online display of confidential records and reports is a part of this celebration. Titled “Representing Colonial Resistance from Archival Texts: From 1800 to 1914”, the report also includes documents related to political agitations held at various colleges like BN College and Patna College and the public halls in Patna between 1900 and 1914. Over 100 confidential records and documents, from 1800 to 1914, will be made available on the archives’ website. “People have been reading about our freedom fighters like Veer Kunwar Singh or about Pir Ali and Birsa Munda in text books. But going through the original reports on their works and activities is an altogether different experience. These British government reports and letters may reveal many new things,” said Mahendrapal Singh, director, Bihar State Archives. “For decades, these reports remained confidential. Now is the time to make it public. People should know what exactly happened at that time and how did it happen,” he said. Dr Rashmi Kiran, who is handling the online display of confidential records, said this was important because many important aspects of the freedom struggle and sacrifices of people have remained least known and are rarely discussed. “We tend to ignore tribal resistances against Colonial rulers. Much before the better known struggle, tribals of United Bihar had started resisting the British rulers,” she said. Besides, there is also less information among people about the students’ meetings held in the state capital much before Mahatma Gandhi stepped into the country’s freedom movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-before-gandhi-state-archives-plans-to-make-public-lesser-known-struggles-against-british-101628007931218.html

Meanwhile, chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar visited flood-hit areas of Vaishali, Samastipur, Muzaffarpur and Chapra districts to take stock of relief operations amid lurking fear of resurgence of Covid-19 pandemic.The river’s tributaries, Punpun and Dardha, are also in spate and reportedly causing damage in southern areas of Patna, inundating dozens of villages of Dhanarua and Masaurhi blocks. As per reports, zamindari embankments along Dardha river have been washed away at many places in Dhanarua block, leaving thousands marooned. The floodwaters are also posing threat to overtop the Patna-Gaya highway, which is barely two to three metres above the water at a diversion near Masaurhi. Officials in the water resources department (WRD) said the Ganga was flowing nearly 30cm above the DL at Gandhi Ghat and 26cm above the DL at Hathidah, and almost touched the red mark of 50.45m near Digha Ghat. The river’s water level is also approaching the DL at Kahalgaon and maintains a rising trend, officials said. Punpun has jumped the DL at Sripalpur by around two metres, engulfing low-lying areas of south Patna region, they said. River Kosi, that earlier breached its embankment near Dagmara in Supaul, has flooded five out of seven blocks of flood-prone Khagaria district. The floodwaters from Bagmati, which still flows above the danger marks at Sonakhan in Sitamarhi, Benibad in Muzaffarpur and Hayaghat in Darbhanga, has left thousands marooned. Kamala Balan and Khiroi rivers are also flowing above the DL in Madhubani and Darhbanga districts, respectively.Taking serious note, the CM during his visit instructed district authorities concerned to carry out relief operations on a war footing and ensure adherence to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour at relief camps. Additional chief secretary, roads, Amrit Lal Meena, water resources secretary Sanjeen Hans and other senior officers accompanied the CM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/flood-threat-looms-over-patna-as-ganga-crosses-danger-mark-cm-takes-stock-101628007872069.html

I, Mulayam Singh ji and Sharad bhai had struggled hard and raised issues related to Mandal commission and caste census in Parliament,” he said, adding that caste-based census should be done at all costs.Prasad met Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav on Monday.Sharad Yadav, who formed his own outfit after falling out with Nitish Kumar and quitting Janata Dal (United), had contested the 2019 parliamentary polls as RJD candidate from Madhepura but lost to Dinesh Chandra Yadav of the JD(U).All three leaders were once part of the old Janata Dal.“We are trying to unite all old Janata Dal forces. Talks are going on. Efforts to form a third front is also a welcome step as it would throw a viable alternative to people,” Prasad said.On Bihar, Prasad said RJD had come very close to power in the 2020 assembly elections but missed could not form government due to electoral manipulation. “I was in jail during the assembly polls, but Tejashwi fought alone and was close to forming the government. But some of our candidates lost by a margin of 10-15 votes due to electoral manipulation,” he said.Prasad had been incarcerated since December 2017 following his conviction in fodder scam cases and was released on bail in April this year.Asked if he still has a place in heart for his friend-turned-foe, chief minister Nitish Kumar, Prasad said, “People make a place in your heart and then relationships turn sour. Yes, Kumar was with us,” Prasad said, evading a direct reply. Asked about possibility of Kumar coming with the RJD again, Prasad did not comment.On JD(U)’s bid to project Kumar as “PM material”, the RJD chief said, “Let PM Narendra Modi take note of it. BJP has already said there is no vacancy for PM post.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/chirag-real-leader-of-ljp-should-work-with-tejashwi-lalu-101628007871323.html

It is a rare view for those who have for long been demanding constant flow of water in the river, on the banks of which the historical city of Agra is located. Despite this welcome change, there is also concern as flood threat lurks. The river is flowing at 491.4 feet, a little below the danger mark of 495 feet. The Chambal river in the rural belt is also rising. So the district administration has started taking measures to counter flood threat. District magistrate Prabhu N Singh visited Pinahat area on Tuesday and assessed the situation on the banks of the Chambal. “The water level is on the rise in Chambal, although it is yet to touch the 128-metre mark. It had gone up to 136 metres in 2019 and that had marooned at least five villages. We are on the alert as the water is expected to rise further,” the DM said. River Chambal flows in the border areas of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Good rain in the region had caused its water level to rise, said a villager living in one of the villages on the bank of the Chambal. The danger level in Chambal is at 130 metres and presently the water level is yet to touch the 128-metre mark. The administration is taking measures to meet the situation if the water level rises further. “Our concern is to save precious human livese and minimize losses in case of flood,” said the DM. Meanwhile, water is being released in river Yamuna from various dams, including include Gokul Barrage in Mathura, Okhla Barrage in Delhi and Tajewala barrage of Hathini Kund in Haryana.

03-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai railway commuters lose valuables worth ₹5.25 crore in 6 months||Suburban railway commuters in Mumbai have lost cash and valuables amounting to ₹5.25 crore to robbers and fatka gang members in past six months.The government railway police (GRP) have registered 2,654 cases between January 1 and June 30 this year. Those include 2,543 or 95% cases of thefts and robberies. However, the police have been able to solve only 907 cases, recovering stolen valuables worth ₹1.58 crore.Experts said that in spite of CCTVs installed on railway premises, the crime rate has been increasing throughout the railway premises while the detection rate and recovery of the stolen property remain low. The GRP officers said that the soaring numbers of thefts and robberies and the low detection rate has left them concerned as the majority of such crimes are committed by youngsters between the ages of 16 years and 25 years or freshers who do not have any past record of committing any crime.Police officers said that a maximum number of these robbers are not residents of Mumbai. These robbers arrive in Mumbai, commit the crime and flee back to their village, “The booty robbed by them is sold within just two to three days of the crime which makes it difficult to trace them and recover the booty,” said a GRP officer.In the past two months, the GRP has registered 303 cases of bag lifting, which were earlier registered as missing cases and not investigated at all, amounted to a loss of property worth ₹1.12 crore. Out of these 74 cases have been solved by the police.GRP commissioner Quaiser Khalid has since instructed all GRP units across the city to register all bag missing cases as thefts (FIRs) and investigate them.Khalid said that the move was adopted on the lines of directives issued by previous GRP commissioner Nikhet Kaushik who had started registering mobile missing cases as thefts. The drive led to the recovery of several lost or stolen mobile phones, and arrests of thieves and robbers. The GRP statistics revealed that in 2016 number of mobile phones robbery cases registered were only 1,590 however after the move by Kaushik in 2017 the cases rose to 18,000.In 2018 the GRP recorded 32,476 mobile theft cases and in 2019, 24,010 cases were reported. Out of these theft cases in 2018 recovery was 2,517 mobiles and 2,130 robbers were arrested and in 2019 the recovery of mobile phones was at 2,319 and 3,000 robbers were arrested.Based on this move, Khalid had come up with instructions to register all bag missing cases as thefts. “Normally when we register a bag missing case, it is not investigated and chances of getting the belongings were low however now when an FIR is registered, the officers will be compelled to investigate the case and recover the stolen booty,” said Khalid.Khalid added that when a commuter forgets his bag or wallet or drops it by mistake in a train or railway premises, he would have to check the lost and found department of the terminal where the train concludes, “In case the commuter does not find his belongings there, he will have to approach the GRP police station and register a complaint of theft,” said Khalid.Generally, when the commuter forgets his bag on the train, it is kept in the lost and found department by the railway staff such as cleaning personal or security, “However if the bag or wallet does not reach the lost and found department, it is assumed to have got stolen,” added Khalid.The police officers will then check the CCTVs of railway stations where the commuter said he forgot the bag and track it till the last station or terminal where the train concludes its journey trying to locate the bag etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-railway-commuters-lose-valuables-worth-5-25-crore-in-6-months-101628005891752.html

Instead of having to shut down at 4pm, he can now operate till 10pm, according to the new guidelines issued by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) . “This 4pm timing was not feasible at all to run our businesses. In fact, there would be crowds at our outlets in the morning, which made it difficult to maintain social distancing. Now we will get some relief,” said Parmar. As part of the Maharashtra government’s decision to partially lift lockdown restrictions, the Mumbai civic body, on Monday, allowed shops to open everyday till 10pm. Earlier, shops could be opened only from Monday to Friday till 4pm. Restaurants in the city have been allowed to remain open till 4pm everyday. Earlier, restaurants could be opened till 4pm only from Monday to Friday. The new rules came into effect from Tuesday. Also Read | Shops to operate on all days till 10pm from today in MumbaiLike Parmar, thousands of shopkeepers in Mumbai heaved a sigh of relief as BMC relaxed the timings for shops till 10pm from Tuesday. However the decision has caused restaurant owners to cry foul, as they still have to close their establishments by 4pm. “There is positivity among the shopkeepers due to this decision. Now we can operate our shops during our normal working hours,” said Mitesh Mody, who owns an electronic outlet at Lamington Road. “However, our main challenge is getting the workers to work as they live far off and they are not allowed on the railways,” said Mody. Hotel owners, meanwhile, angry over this decision. “This is total discrimination. In fact, it is easy to adhere to Covid-appropriate norms in restaurants, but a picture is being created that we are spreading Covid-19, which is misleading,” said Shivanand Shetty, president, Indian Hotels and Restaurant Association (AHAR). All Hotel Associations will hold a meeting at Bandra on Wednesday to chalk out a plan of action among fears that this will sound the death knell for the sector. Most shops have been facing the brunt of the Covid-19 pandemic from the last one year. Though they were allowed to reopen for a few months, they again had to face a shutdown due to the second wave. This has caused huge losses to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-shopkeepers-delighted-at-timing-extension-hoteliers-cry-discrimination-101627998211486.html

03-08-2021||Dehradun||Illegal crossing of Indo-Nepal border in Pithoragarh has forces worried||The recent drowning of a 33-year-old Nepalese national at Indo-Nepal border near Uttarakhand’s Dharchula town in Pithoragarh district has brought the focus back on Nepalese citizens illegally crossing the border to enter India. Jaya Singh Dhami’s drowning on Friday morning has led to an outrage in Nepal with locals alleging that India’s Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel, patrolling the border, cut off an iron wire stretching across river Mahakali that separates the two countries at that point, resulting in Dhami falling into the swollen river. They claim that at the time of the incident, Dhami was sliding on the wire, which was tied to a tree across the river on the Indian side for the purpose of illegal crossings.The SSB has, however, refuted the allegations and said that the man died after two other Nepalese citizens, who had already crossed into the Indian side, cut the wire after spotting that the SSB patrolling team was coming towards them. The SSB personnel deployed in the area also said that they often intercept such illegal border crossing mechanisms at the border in Dharchula and have often raised concerns before their Nepalese counterparts. “The Nepalese citizens often use such improvised river crossing mechanisms using iron wire, locally called- ‘tuin’, “ one SSB personnel said requesting not to be identified. “The Nepalese citizens tie one end of the iron wire to a tree or pole on their side, while the other end is tied to a tree on the Indian side across the river by their Indian aides here. They then attach a pulley to the wire and slide across the river while sitting inside an improvised metal drum, which is tied to the pulley with a rope. They cross into the Indian side for business and other purposes,” said the personnel. A SSB officer too corroborated the theory.”The illegal ‘Tuins’ (improvised border crossing mechanism) are installed at many places at the border, which has a very difficult terrain. However, we have been dismantling them during patrolling. These mechanisms are being installed with the help of some Indians, especially the local taxi drivers who ferry the Nepalese citizens to markets in Dharchula,” said the officer. He added that, “there were certain taxi drivers who were provoking the Nepalese citizens across the border to hold demonstrations against us and the Indian administration because we have been dismantling the Tuins, affecting their business.” He added that such illegal border crossing mechanisms “could also be used by terrorists”. “In that case, fingers would be pointed at the SSB that it let them cross the border,” said the officer. Mahendra Pratap, Commandant SSB Dharchula said, “We have asked Nepal’s Armed Police Force (SSB’s counterpart) to take action against their people who have been installing such illegal river crossing mechanisms. However, they too fail to take proper action because of the difficult terrain of the area. We have also asked the local administration of Dharchula to take action against some local taxi drivers who are helping the Nepalese citizens in crossing the border illegally,” said Pratap. Anil Kumar Shukla, sub-divisional magistrate Dharchula said, “We have been taking action against with the help of local police. We also warn people against such illegal activities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/illegal-crossing-of-indo-nepal-border-in-pithoragarh-has-forces-worried-101627994131418.html

03-08-2021||Other||51 cases filed in 2021-22 so far for misusing online study platforms: Kerala CM||Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday warned of stringent action against anti-social activities and cybercrimes associated with attempts to misuse the online study platforms meant for children. Addressing the state assembly, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) leader said that although the cyber sector has multiple positive aspects, it is lately being misused by anti-social elements for committing offences and misleading children.“One such intervention was the hacking of online classes by creating fake IDs and uploading obscene conversations and videos to the (social media) groups in which children, teachers and parents are members,” Vijayan said, adding that ensuring “uncompromising security” is the need of the hour.The chief minister also said that police have received as many as 51 such complaints during the ongoing 2021-22 academic year, of which eight were lodged after verification of information and probe into them is underway.Vijayan’s statements came as a reply to a submission by CPM legislator Sachin Dev on the recent attempts by vested interests to hack into digital study platforms of children.He further told the assembly that the state government has taken all possible measures to curtail such incidents of misuse though it has only limited control over several online platforms as most of them are foreign-made.The chief minister said that only in-depth awareness can make children conscious of dangers of cybercrimes and misuse of study portals, and that “it requires our collective effort.”Notably, in June, Vijayan said that digital devices and internet connectivity would be provided to all students of the state regardless of their monetary and geographical hurdles in order to facilitate online classes during the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.He also stated that immediate steps would be adopted to ensure internet for free or at subsidised rate to needy children – as an aim to alleviate the ‘digital divide’ among students in the state. Vijayan said that the internet connectivity issue in tribal and remote regions of Kerala would also be addressed.“We have already called a meeting of internet service providers in this regard… Our aim is to avoid giving any kind of burden to students and ensure hassle-free environs for their online studies,” he told the state Assembly.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/51-cases-filed-in-2021-22-so-far-for-misusing-online-study-platforms-kerala-cm-101627991213945.html
03-08-2021||Kolkata||Central agency ready to probe Bengal post-poll violence: Govt to HC||A central agency like the CBI or NIA is ready to probe allegations of post-poll violence in West Bengal, the Centre told the Calcutta high court on Tuesday. Additional solicitor general YJ Dastoor told the high court that the Centre was ready to assist the state goverment if the court directed a central agency to “take up investigation of some of the serious offences”.A five-judge bench headed by acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal is hearing PILs pertaining to allegations of post poll violence in the state. In June, the court directed the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to constitute a committee to examine all cases of alleged violence after the recent assembly elections. The report by the seven-member committee slammed the TMC-ruled state government while recommending a CBI probe. Also Read | 30 Covid hospitals put on notice over fire safety certificate, Gujarat to SC“The NIA or the CBI can be called upon to investigate if your Lordships preferred,” said Dastoor. The bench, however, questioned whether it would be an appropriate time to transfer the cases when all the FIRs are with the state police.Advocate general Kishore Dutta, appearing for the West Bengal government, said to the court, “The police acted contemporaneously. Whenever the police came to know of complaints, they had taken action. It is not that the police was completely inactive. Even without the NHRC’s reference of complaints, the police had registered FIRs,” Dutta said. The NHRC report had stated that the spate of violence in the state shows a pernicious politico-bureaucratic-criminal nexus while alleging that there was police inaction. Also appearing for the state government, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi said the NHRC report cannot be relied upon as it was prepared by an ad hoc body. He also told the court that there was gross exaggeration of the statements of the victims in Bengali and the translation made by the NHRC in English. The court reserved its order after hearing the arguments of both sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/central-agency-ready-to-probe-bengal-post-poll-violence-govt-to-hc-101627988670981.html
03-08-2021||Pune||Four-fold increase in online liquor purchase fraud in Pune city; 1,595 cases registered in seven months||Amid the restrictions in place if you are planning to get liquor delivered to your doorstep make sure you take all precautionary measures. The cases of online liquor purchase-related fraud have increased four-fold since 2019 in Pune city, according to Pune city police’s cybercrime complaint records.From 440 cases in 2019, the city has recorded 1,595 cases from January 2021 to July.The lockdown restrictions that necessitated the online purchasing of commodities was seen as the cause of this exponential rise.“It is not just liquor. Necessities also needed to be purchased online. Malls are shut even now, where did all these vendors go? They had to do something. Even a small-time “pani-puri” vendor can take his business online now and so did the liquor vendors. So people started searching for liquor stores near them,” said Bhagyashree Navatake, deputy commissioner of police, cybercrime and economic offence wing (EOW) of Pune city.The cases had increased in 2020 itself as the lockdown extensions started setting in. However, as the pandemic-related lockdown made staying indoors mandatory, the online orders went up.“I had called a store that is located in my area. The shop is genuine. But this man had tampered with the phone number registered with the wine shop on Google maps. I called the number and ordered wine and hr asked for payment before delivery. Because I knew about the shop, I agreed, and he sent me a QR code. I scanned and made the payment only to see that it had debited more than ₹16,000 from my account. I called him and he kept saying that the transaction never went through and that I must have received the text by mistake. I lost more than ₹1,16,000,” said a 30-year-old man who had ordered alcohol in Viman nagar in May 2021.“The number of these cases have shot up in May and April this year. And this year the cases are even higher than the previous year,” said police inspector Vidya Jadhav of unit 2 of the cybercrime cell of Pune police.The fraudster blocked the complainant’s number and was later found to have been active even after a police complaint and a subsequent first information report (FIR) was registered at the cyber police station.As a solution to such frauds, Navatake said, “The only solution is to not make the payment before you have physically seen the product. Always buy only from known platforms that have grievance redressal systems in place. The money is hard-earned and therefore should not be handed over to unknown platforms or people. Awareness is the only solution.”Year/Liquor-related online fraud cases2019: 4392020: 1,368Till July 30, 2021: 1,595(Source: Pune city police cybercrime )Take these precautions*Make payment when you physically see the product*Buy from known platforms that have grievance redressal systems*Be aware while buying online||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fourfold-increase-in-online-liquor-purchase-fraud-in-pune-city-1-595-cases-registered-in-seven-months-101627988250802.html
03-08-2021||Pune||Pune’s Civic Sanskriti: Why your ‘handprint’ could help offset the growing ecological footprint||The Earth Overshoot Day for 2021 was on July 29. Calculated every year by the Global Footprint Network, the Earth Overshoot Date is the date by when humanity’s demand for ecological resources and services in a given year, its Ecological Footprint, exceeds what the Earth can regenerate in that year, its biocapacity.The Footprint is the demand for food from farms, fisheries, and pastures, for shelter, clothing, and infrastructure. It also includes the land area needed to absorb the carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels.The biocapacity of a state or country refers to the biologically productive lands and seas, such as forest areas, grazing areas, farms, and fishing areas. A significant component of the Ecological Footprint is the Carbon Footprint, which is the land area needed to sequester carbon dioxide emitted from fossil fuel burning and cement production.Since the 1970s, humanity’s Ecological Footprint has been exceeding the earth’s biocapacity. Worse, the yearly date by which we collectively consume all of the biocapacity has been steadily decreasing. It was in November in the 1970s, October in the 1980s, and September, by the turn of the century.Now, we need 1.7 Earths to meet our needs and wants. Trips to space will not solve our problem; we need to live lighter on our own planet!The Ecological Footprint may be calculated at different levels, such as for an individual, an organisation, a city or a country. The Footprint or impact of all countries is not the same. It is influenced by the climate of a place (necessitating heating or cooling of buildings), the nature of the economy, production and consumption systems, and people’s lifestyles.India’s Ecological Footprint does not exceed its biocapacity currently, but it may soon do so. However, there is a huge variation in the consumption levels and the well-being of different people. There is a large proportion of the population whose essential nutrition, healthcare, and decent housing needs are not met. Decent living standards have been achieved for a smaller number. However, many people, especially in urban areas, are now over-consuming – some by choice, others thoughtlessly, and yet others by compulsion because low-carbon options are not yet well-developed (e.g. in public transport or cycling).This presents a few different challenges.First, how should production, consumption, and especially economic and governance systems be organised to enhance people’s living standards and well-being? These may include, for example, strengthening public distribution systems for rations, housing up-gradation, access to education, public transport, etc. A second challenge is to promote the shift to renewable energy and move to a circular economy with sustainablematerials and recycling. Such changes can help to bring down consumption levels at a systemic level.Yet another is how individuals can think about and change their lifestyles, behaviour to tread a bit lighter on the planet. Individual and collective action is called for.I want to share the concept of the “Handprint”. The Handprint is the symbol of, measure for, and commitment to positive action towards sustainability. Handprint also stands for caring and working together towards a sustainable future.While the Footprint is a measure of human pressure on earth’s resources, the Handprint measures what we can do individually and together to restore the balance between consumption and the planet’s carrying capacity.The Handprint concept was evolved and adopted at a conference on Education for Sustainable Development at CEE in 2007. It was inspired by a 10-year old student Srija, who participated in an environmental project at her school in Hyderabad.There is much to be done in everyday activities such as avoiding food waste, promoting organics, waste recycling, composting, walking, cycling facilities, greening, plantation, water management, and solar water heating. While technologies and solutions are generally known in these familiar topics, getting them underway often needs creativity and perseverance.Examining one’s own life and lifestyle, engaging with the neighbourhood, a community, a school or college or a workplace, and working with the local government offer many opportunities for Handprint actions. All of us need to become Handprint Action Heroes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punes-civic-sanskriti-why-your-handprint-could-help-offset-the-growing-ecological-footprint-101627987651185.html
03-08-2021||Pune||Pune traders allege bias, demand relaxations in curfew, will violate deadline||Hundreds of traders in Pune held ‘Ghanta Nad’(Bell clanging) protest on Tuesday to draw the Maharashtra government’s attention to their demand for an extension in current operation hours for shop keepers in the city following similar relief given to 22 other districts in the state on the basis of their respective Covid-19 caseloads. The restriction to end operation by 4 pm between Monday and Friday was retained for all shops in Pune district, inviting protests from traders, industries and restaurants in the city.“Covid cases have gone down in Pune city and yet shop timings continue to be up to 4pm. To oppose this biased decision by the state government, all our association members and traders across the city protested today while planning to keep the shops open till 7 pm from tomorrow,” said Fatechand Ranka, president of Federation of Trade Association of Pune (FTAP).The business community wants Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad municipal limits and rural parts of districts to be assessed as separate administrative units to decide their grade of relaxation citing lower Covid positivity rates. Maharashtra government on Monday left out 11 districts including Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara, Pune, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Solapur, Ahmednagar, Beed, Raigad, and Palghar from the ambit of relaxations citing their high Covid-19 caseloads. Maharashtra recorded 4,869 fresh cases on Monday, taking its tally to 6,315,063 including 75,303 active cases.The association says it has reasons to allege bias claiming the new relaxations allow all essential and non-essential shops to remain open till 10 pm in Mumbai and 8 pm in other districts where relaxations have been given. It said that while the state government allowed the civic bodies to take the final call on easing of restrictions in Mumbai city, suburban areas and Thane, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad were denied any relief.At around 11.45 am several traders gathered near Sonya Maruti Chowk on Laxmi Road in Pune city before marching towards Alka Talkies Chowk while beating kitchen utensils and Bells. Similarly, other shop owners, traders and their local unions across the city protested in front of their shops.Ranka accused Uddhav Thackeray government of “favouring” Mumbai since the Shiv Sena controls the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).“Shiv Sena government has given relaxations to Mumbai just because it is in power in the BMC. But in Pune, another political party is in power so they are not giving any relaxations to Pune. We have decided to keep our shops open from tomorrow up to 7 pm and [are] ready to face any action taken by the police or government authorities,” said Ranka, referring to the fact that the Bharatiya Janata Party runs the Pune corporation.Maharashtra’s minister for minority affairs and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik rejected the allegation and said the government relaxed curbs in Mumbai because the positivity rate there was less than 1%. “Tomorrow if Pune’s cases come down, government will immediately ease restrictions,” said Malik. Pune’s Covid positivity rate for the week ending August 1 was 3.3%, as per the health department’s data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-traders-allege-bias-demand-relaxations-in-curfew-will-violate-deadline-101627986091223.html

In spite of categorical observations in the reports of the statutory regulators, not even a single person is shown to have been prosecuted,” a bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel noted. The tribunal called this a “clear failure” of constitutional obligations of the relevant authorities, who, it said, have continued to remain “mute spectators of serious crimes against humanity.”“Therefore, the said authorities have failed to realise that they are holding positions of high trust and not to just enjoy position and perks at the cost of miseries of innocent citizens,” the green body said further.The bench was referring to authorities such as Noida authority, district magistrates, Uttar Pradesh State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA), UP Police and the Pollution Control Board. It further directed officials from both Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, including the two chief secretaries, to hold in-house meeting with concerned departments within 15 days to take stock of the situation and plan various corrective measures, including accountability of erring officers, preventing pollutants from being discharged into drains etc. The Delhi Jal Board (DJB), it said, needs to confirm that no sewage or any other effluent is being discharged into drains entering Noida, while the latter has to explain the sewage management status of sewage generated by residential socities“The tribunal expects meaningful improvement in the situation to prevent serious violations affecting the right to life, which have been going on for a long time without any meaningful action,” the bench said.

03-08-2021||Patna||CAG report notes irregularities in tax payments, vehicle registrations in Bihar||A Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) audit of Bihar transport departments’ functioning in financial year 2018-19 has revealed several irregularities including absence of mechanism to realise timely payment of taxes and fees from automobile dealers and ensuring vehicles are delivered to customers only after mandatory registration at the dealer-point.“Delivery of vehicles without registration mark not only compromised the objective of dealer-point registration to ensure... registration mark and immediate realisation of road tax, but also posed a risk as such vehicles can be easily misused for unlawful activities,” the CAG report tabled in the Bihar legislative assembly on July 29, said.It pointed out that the dealer’s failure to adhere to these rules was due to absence of deterrence or cost attached by the transport department. “Absence of any return, binding obligation as well as deterrent measures for the dealers to ensure delivery of vehicles after assigning registration mark is indicative of the weak control mechanism in the transport department, which led to undue delay in payment of taxes and fees,” the report added.Central motor vehicle rules 1989 provide that vehicles cannot be delivered without either temporary or permanent registration.The report notes that while the dealer-point registration system was functional in all the 38 district transport offices in the state, there was still delay in payment of taxes by 488 authorised dealers for 423,897 vehicles for a period ranging from one day to 1997 days (nearly five and a half years).“Audit verified documents of 2,920 out of 423,897 vehicles as submitted by dealers and observed that all of them were delivered prior to issue of registration mark,” the report said,The report underlined the grave situation by pointing out specific cases of brazen non-compliance with the rules.“In Sheohar district, an authorised dealer was found to have delivered 24 vehicles in December 2018 and uploaded required documents for registration in March, 2019 without payment of due tax and without allotment of temporary registration. Allotment of temporary registration at the time of delivery would have also brought additional revenue of ₹3.16 crore to the state government,” the report said.In its reply, the transport department said that “temporary registration was not a matter of right, instead it was a choice of the vehicle purchaser and hence the department did not levy temporary registration fee”.The department also argued that after February 2018 vehicles were delivered following the required procedure.“After implementation of VAHAN-4 (between May 2017 and February 2018), vehicles were delivered only after realisation of due tax and fee and allotment of permanent registration mark. In case of DTO Shehohar, necessary instructions have been issued to remit the amount realised from the dealer,” the department said.Vahan 4.0 is a web-based software which enables the registration of vehicles online along with e-payment of taxes, fees.However, the audit did not find the department’s reply tenable, as it didn’t cover why the system was not put in place to ensure timely remittance of tax realised by dealers after its realisation from buyers of vehicles.The audit report also pointed out that “due to absence of guidelines/supporting documents for registration of tractor and tractor trailer, seven district transport offices (DTO) registered 8,969 tractors or tractor-trailer combinations under agriculture category in arbitrary manner leading to loss of ₹25.22 crore in revenue.”“In Bhagalpur, no tractor or tractor-trailer has been registered in the commercial category since May 2017, indicating that discretionary powers were misused by the DTOs. On the other hand, in DTOs, in eight of the 15 test checked districts, no tractor was registered in the agriculture category. The department partially accepted it when pointed out and stated that necessary instruction had been issued to all DTOs to obtain certificates from tractor owners at the time of registration about the intended purpose,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/cag-report-notes-irregularities-in-tax-payments-vehicle-registrations-in-bihar-101627983330842.html

The monitoring committee met on Monday evening under the chairmanship of chief secretary SS Sandhu. Uttarkashi district magistrate Mayur Dixit, a committee member, said, “The decision on the project will be taken after we have studied its details.” Also Read | Uttarakhand extends Covid curfew till August 10, vaccination drive to continueDixit said among the issues discussed in the meeting on Monday included conservation initiatives that need to be taken, disaster management practices that need to be adopted. The zonal master plan of BESZ was approved in July last year by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC). This would expedite the execution of the Char Dham road project. Meanwhile, Hemant Dhyani, a resident of BESZ and member of Supreme Court appointed High Powered committee (HPC) on Char Dham Project has written to the state chief secretary, alleging violation and non-compliance of BESZ notification. Dhyani said in his letter that in February this year, Uttarkashi DM permitted someone from outside the state to buy 0.659 hectare agriculture land in BESZ for construction of a resort, which is based on misleading information that distance of river Bhagirathi is about 100 m north of this land. “I have attached photos in the letter which show that the entire land is just adjacent to the active flood plain of river Bhagirathi,” he said. Dhyani alleged that the land use was also changed to facilitate the construction through a letter issued by the district administration in May this year. “It is not only in gross violation of BESZ notification but also violates the by-laws of the state itself which prohibit construction close to the river flood plain.” Dhyani has urged the monitoring committee to cancel land-use change permission given in February, carry out environmental impact assessment (EIA) as per the standard procedure set by MoEF&CC for the activities of land-use change in case of village road construction, solid waste management site or any other similar activities and disqualify all such commercial complexes in close proximity of water streams or rivers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bhagirathi-zone-panel-seeks-report-on-proposed-ski-chair-lift-in-uttarkashi-101627982790811.html
03-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi Cabinet okays policy to promote medical O2 production||The Delhi government on Tuesday approved the Medical Oxygen Production Promotion policy 2021 which aims to make the national capital self-reliant in the production of medical oxygen for medical emergencies in the future by incentivising private enterprises that invest on production, transportation and storage of medical oxygen broadly through power subsidies and tax reimbursements.The policy was drafted after Delhi faced a severe crisis of medical oxygen during its fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic – also the worst so far – in April this year, said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.“Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal led Delhi Cabinet approved the Medical Oxygen Production Promotion Policy 2021, along with the provision for incentives for the production of medical oxygen. This policy is part of the Delhi government’s rigorous effort to make Delhi self-reliant in the production of medical oxygen to meet any medical emergency in the future,” said a statement issued by the CM’s office after Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting.Kejriwal said in the statement, “The Medical Oxygen Production Promotion Policy 2021 provides several incentives to the Pvt. sector to set up oxygen production plants, storage facilities, and oxygen tankers… This policy will help improve oxygen availability in Delhi, which became a huge bottleneck in handling the last Covid-19 wave.”A senior government official said that the policy is likely to be notified later this month.The statement said the objectives of the policy are “to make Delhi self-reliant in terms of medical oxygen production and supply” which the government aims to achieve by encouraging the setting up new manufacturing enterprises and expanding the production capacity of existing ones for “uninterrupted oxygen supply” to hospitals and nursing homes and “to facilitate storage and transportation of medical oxygen in Delhi”.Also Read | Delhi CM Kejriwal launches initiative to make Delhi global city by 2047Last month, lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal reviewed the progress of 160 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants in the city which are supposed to be installed in both public sector and private sector hospitals this year and collectively have a capacity of producing more than 148 MT medical oxygen per day. While 66 PSA plants, including 17 under PM-CARES fund, are being set up in Delhi government-run hospitals, 10 are being installed in central Government, and 84 in private hospitals.“Of the 66 plants in Delhi government hospitals, 36 PSA plants have been commissioned, three are ready and the remaining are expected to be commissioned by August 31. In the Central government hospitals, six out of 10 plants have been commissioned, and the remaining are to be commissioned by August 15. In private hospitals, 37 out of 84 plants have been commissioned while work is in progress on the remaining 47,” said a senior government official, adding, “At least 34 PSA oxygen plants are likely to be commissioned in different hospitals in the city by October 31.”In April, Delhi witnessed an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases which left the healthcare infrastructure overwhelmed. At its peak, Delhi added a daily average of 25,294 new Covid-19 cases for the seven days ending April 23. A severe crisis of medical oxygen turned the situation worse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cabinet-okays-policy-to-promote-medical-o2-production-101627980570482.html

03-08-2021||Jaipur||No digital access, no problem: Rajasthan teachers hold classes outdoors||For children with no digital access, classes are now conducted under trees and the open sky in Dekhla village in Jamwaramgarh tehsil of Jaipur, Rajasthan. Schools have been closed for over one-and-a-half years due to the pandemic, and most classes (be in government school or private school) are conducted online. However, there’s a large section of students that has no access to any digital medium or smartphone or is living in areas with poor network. Considering this, two teachers of Government Primary School, Dekhla, decided to start holding classes outdoors from June 30, and beautified the school by painting its walls during the lockdown. Students now maintain social distance as they sit around a tree and study from 8am to 10.30am twice a week. “We inform the students when the next class will be held. There are online modules for students but many don’t have digital access; besides the network is too poor here,” said Narendra Kumar, a teacher at the government school in Dekhla. There are around 70 students in the school who could not study for the last one-and-a-half years, but now are attending the outdoor classes. “The parents are happy and children are also taking an interest. Many of them had forgotten the basics as they were out of touch,” said Kumar. On asking what motivates them, he said, “We are paid for this, and its our duty to ensure that the children continue with their education.” Kumar, along with the school principal, even beautified the walls of the schools during the lockdown. “We were sitting idle during March-April so painted the wall,” he said. Speaking on the initiative, Class 4 student Ekta said, “My two brothers and I couldn’t go to school due to lockdown. We couldn’t afford online classes and now that classes are held near our home, we all are attending regularly,” she said. A senior state education department official said in the last academic session 2020-21, out of 8.3 million students, only 3.3 million attended online classes, which means 5 million were deprived of education. The department claimed that 3.7 million students were educated via TV and radio under the Aao Ghar Se Sikhe programme, but despite this, 1.3 million students could not attend classes. He said this academic year, the department is targeting educating 7 million students online. The department’s deputy director Arun Sharma said the department started the Smile programme wherein teachers would prepare education material for online classes. But when they realized that many students did not have digital access, the Aao Ghar se Sikhe programme was started. Under Aao Ghar se Sikhe, the teachers document the students’ homework, and take the weekly quizzes to their houses for them to solve, he said. Meanwhile, teachers of a government school in Barmer’s Bhimtal village have started travel on a camel gifted to them by villagers so they can hold classes right in their villages. The mobile network here is very poor as well. Initially, it began with classes at one village, around a kilometre away from the government senior secondary school, Bhimtal. But gradually, more parents wanted their children to be taught, so more villages were added to schedule. Students here are informed two days in advance of the visit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/no-digital-access-no-problem-rajasthan-teachers-hold-classes-outdoors-101627965272206.html

Of these, 2,543 or 95℅ cases are of theft and robbery, and only 907 cases could be solved, with recovery of goods worth ₹1.58 crore.To crack down on robbers, the GRP has started registering all missing bag cases as those of theft. In the past two months, the GRP has registered 303 cases of bag lifting, which were earlier registered as missing cases and not investigated at all, amounting to a loss of property worth ₹1.12 crore. Out of these, police have solved 74 cases.All GRP units have been instructed to register all missing bag cases as thefts. GRP commissioner Quaiser Khalid said that the move was adopted along the lines of directives issued by then GRP commissioner Nikhet Kaushik in 2017 to register mobile missing cases as thefts. The drive led to recovery of several lost / stolen mobile phones and arrests of the thieves and robbers.Taking cue from that, Khalid issued directives to register missing bag cases as thefts. “When we register a missing bag case, it is not investigated and chances of getting the belongings are low. Now that an FIR is registered, the officers are compelled to investigate the case,” he said.Khalid said normally, when a commuter forgets his bag or wallet in a train or railway premises, he would have to check the lost and found department of the terminal where the train concludes. “In case the commuter does not find his belongings there, he will have to approach the GRP police station and register a complaint of theft,” said Khalid.The police officers will then check the CCTVs of railway stations where the commuter said he forgot the bag and track it till the last station or terminal where the train concludes its journey trying to locate the bag.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thefts-on-rise-on-mumbai-suburban-trainsgrp-101627961789999.html

03-08-2021||Delhi||MHA nod to raise salaries, Delhi lawmakers says hike ‘too low’||The Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) has approved an increase of the salary and allowances of Delhi’s lawmakers to ₹90,000 a month, excluding reimbursements a 66.67% increase from the current ₹54,000 , although this is far lower than the raise sought by the Delhi government. Officials familiar with the matter said the matter will be discussed in a cabinet meeting chaired by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday.The quantum of the raise, the first since 2011, will mean that Delhi’s lawmakers remain among the lowest paid in the country. In Uttar Pradesh for instance, a legislator’s monthly salary and allowances add up to ₹95,000 a month; in Gujarat, ₹1,05,000; in Bihar, ₹1,30,000; in Rajasthan, ₹1,42,500; in Haryana, ₹1,55,000; and in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, ₹1,98,000 and ₹1,90,000 respectively.Telangana pays its lawmakers ₹2,50,000 a month.In addition to the current salary, Delhi’s lawmakers are also eligible for reimbursements worth at least ₹34,000.Speaker Ram Niwas Goel said salaries of all ministers -- seven, including the chief minister -- and the speaker, deputy speaker, chief whip and leader of opposition of the Delhi assembly have also been increased in the same proportion. At present, all of them are entitled to ₹1.20 lakh per month.“Whatever the Delhi government had asked for, the Centre accepted only about 40% of it... It could either accept or reject the Centre’s proposal. So, the city administration has no option but to accept it,” said Goel.The increase approved by MHA is likely to open up a new front in hostilities between the Union government and Delhi’s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government. The latter sought an increase in basic salary of lawmakers from ₹12,000 to ₹50,000, but MHA has increased it to ₹30,000.“The Delhi government is dissatisfied with what has been approved by the Centre,” Delhi government officials said on condition of anonymity.Including reimbursements, they pointed out, the Delhi government sought an increase from ₹88,000 a month to ₹2.1 lakh. Now that MHA has approved a lower raise, the discussion at the meeting tomorrow will be to decide the future course of action, one of the officials added. According to this person, the Delhi government will likely raise salaries in accordance with MHA’s approval immediately.Officials from the MHA did not respond to requests seeking comment.A senior Delhi government official, on condition of anonymity, said the Centre had sent this proposal to Delhi in March, 2020, but the Delhi government did not respond then due to the back-to-back Covid-19 waves that hit the national capital. “So, in July, the file was set in motion again and tomorrow (Tuesday) it will be discussed in the Cabinet,” the official said.Members of Parliament currently earn ₹230,000 a month in salary and allowances.Salaries and allowances of Delhi MLAs were last increased 10 years ago. The Delhi Assembly in 2015 approved a bill to increase the salary and allowances of MLAs by 400%, but the MHA did not approve this. The Delhi government in 2018 formed a six-member committee to take up the issue of salary hike of MLAs with the Centre. In March this year, the chairperson of this committee, AAP’s Greater Kailash MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj, said it was recommending to the Union government that the salaries and allowances be raised by 138.6% at the least.Rituraj Govind, AAP MLA from Kirari, said the increase does not factor inflation. “I have been an MLA since 2015 in Delhi and I can easily say we have to pay a lot from our own pockets on two major things: fuel and social events. Fuel costs have increased so much that the revised amount of ₹10,000 will not suffice. Every month, I have to spend at least ₹20,000 on fuel because as MLA we have to keep going to every corner of our constituency,” he said. Govind added that he spends money out of his pocket on gifts when he is invited to social events.Sanjeev Jha, AAP MLA from Burari, said, “The salary is not enough so I arrange a lot of things through crowd sourcing. For example, someone offered his shop out of goodwill and I have set up an office there. There is no other way out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mha-nod-to-raise-salaries-delhi-lawmakers-says-hike-too-low-101627945652727.html
03-08-2021||Delhi||Concrete, violations take toll on Delhi’s green giants||Two majestic Neem trees that stood tall for around 100 years, shadowing central Delhi’s APJ Abdul Kalam Road, fell in June this year. A survey report prepared by the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) attributes their uprooting to shallow roots — a phenomenon that occurs when the root system does not get enough water or breathing space. Concretisation is a big reason for that. A dense pilkhan, also about 100 years old, on Dr Zakir Hussain Marg dried up and died this May. The survey cited gradual decay because of lack of nutrients and repeated injuries as the reasons for the tree’s death.These towering trees, estimated to have been planted between 1920 and 1935 when New Delhi was being built, are among the 1,391 old and full-grown trees that were uprooted or died between 2015 and July 20 this year. Of these, 199 fell or died between January 1 and July this year, shows the NDMC data consulted by HT.According to NDMC officials, more than 30% of these trees were ‘heritage’ trees (more than 70 years old) with most of the neem and pilkhan trees aged more than 100 years.Ageing apart, concretisation and digging of roads for various civic works are the other two top reasons for the uprooting of trees as these obstruct rainwater from seeping into the ground, which then lowers the water table and affects soil quality, say officials. This is despite the 2013 National Green Tribunal order that prohibits any kind of digging or construction activity within a 1m radius of a tree trunk. “Among the 20-odd native tree species in Lutyens’ Delhi, neem and pilkhan are the most predominant victims of concretisation. On an average, at least 10 heritage neem trees die or fall off every year. These trees have heavy canopies and a girth measuring more than 2m. The tree trunks weaken as the roots do not get enough water and moisture... Eventually, it falls off as its weakened trunk cannot bear the weight of the canopy,” said a senior NDMC official.During its survey, the municipal body found that more than 70% dead cells constituted the core region of the neem trees that died, indicating that the trunk almost had no strength to bear the weight of the canopy. Similarly, the root system became shallow in the pilkhans, which have the heaviest canopy.“Both these species have a tap root system that goes deep into the soil vertically and have a stronghold... Most of these trees are about 100 years old and are now falling off because of concretisation,” said the official.According to data accessed by HT, of the 1,391 trees, 783 were in the category of ‘dead and dry’; 559 were ‘fallen or uprooted’; and 47 were in the ‘dangerous’ category. Most of these are ‘avenue trees’ (planted on both sides of the road), which experts say were planted keeping in mind the aesthetics of each stretch.“It has also been observed that the number of trees in the ‘dead and dry’ category has been increasing. On an average, 110 heritage trees are dying every year. The absence of enough water and moisture reaching the roots facilitates their gradual decay. The wetness leads to infections, pest and termite attacks, eventually leading to the death of the trees,” said another official requesting anonymity.Officials associated with the survey also said that Ganoderma, a fungal infection in trees, was also responsible for the death and decay. “Over the past 5-7 years, this infection has been growing in the collar region of the trunk in many silver oak trees. The infection dries up the epidermal cells, crucial to growth,” said the second official.S Chellaiah, director (horticulture), NDMC, said even with the utmost care, many trees, including heritage ones, are dying due to development activities. “Heritage trees have their own ecological value. What we need to do is have a strong policy to preserve trees and not allow repeated digging or trenching that damages the root system,” said Chellaiah.He said all underground cabling should be done through a single duct that wouldn’t require digging every time a cable has to be laid. “So far, the duct system has been adopted only in Connaught Place,” Chellaiah said, adding that it would require heavy investment but will increase the life span of trees by at least 20-25 years.C R Babu, professor emeritus at DU’s Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystem, said avenue trees in Lutyens’ Delhi are dense and have immense ecological value as they help to keep pollution in check by trapping dust. “These trees need to be preserved by minimising construction activity and maintaining a gap of at least two metres lengthwise,” he said.He added when there is concretisation around trees, their root system does not get enough space to develop or take nutrients and water from the soil. “Besides, many trees in Delhi are dying of termite attacks. In most cases, these are concretised trees which are not able to draw enough moisture and oxygen from their roots and become susceptible to termites,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/concrete-violations-take-toll-on-delhi-s-green-giants-101627941580668.html
03-08-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Kamal Kishor’s first delivery||He doesn’t know what water chestnuts are. Neither has he ever tasted any Thai dish, he says. But he has brought coriander dimsums with water chestnuts, and soggy Thai chicken fried rice for tonight’s dinner.It’s not his.This is Kamal Kishor’s first delivery, here in a south Delhi apartment. This evening he launches himself as a food delivery man, a career that has become more ubiquitous since the pandemic began last year, when eateries shut down for long periods. More and more people have been resorting to mobile phone apps to experience restaurant-grade cuisines at home.“I hope all the dishes are in good condition. It’s my first delivery so I don’t know exactly how it works,” he says nervously. In his 30s, Mr Kishor is a “full-time security guard” but decided to additionally work as a food delivery man in his off-duty hours “because my salary is low”. As he takes out the smartly packed meal boxes from his huge bag, he carefully studies the dish names scrawled on the top of each box, and reads them aloud. A seasoned delivery man simply hands over the food and exits. But Mr Kishor is behaving with the observant thoroughness of a first-time flyer intently paying attention to the air hostess as she mimics the safety instructions before the take-off.This job might help him to support his household, he hopes. “My wife died some years ago, and I‘m left alone to raise my two children.” Daughter Sunridhi, 10, and son Kunal, 8, are at home. It is 9pm. They must have had their dinner, Mr Kishor says. He cooked the meal (arhar dal [lentils], shimla mirch [capsicum], and rice) early in the evening. The kids were watching TV when he left for the assignment. They are under the watchful eyes of his younger brother at this very moment.Mr Kishor now looks at a scrap of paper and wonders if the food he is delivering is already paid for or not. With some embarrassment, he asks the customer to clarify.Later, as he leaves, he expresses delight in the thrill of starting a new chapter in his working life, though he isn’t sure just how much he will earn from this first delivery. “I want to make just enough money so that my kids can realise their dreams. I have to be both papa and mummy to them. I have to work hard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-kamal-kishor-s-first-delivery-101627940311112.html

03-08-2021||Chandigarh||Khattar launches ‘Har Hith store’ scheme, aims to wipe out unemployment by 2024||In a step aimed at encouraging youth towards self-employment, Haryana chief minister (CM) Manohar Lal Khattar on Monday launched the ‘Har Hith store’ scheme, as part of which a chain of grocery shops will be opened in rural and urban areas to sell the best quality daily-needs products at reasonable prices.As per the policy, 1,500 stores will be opened in rural areas and 500 in urban areas in the first phase and 5,000 stores in the second phase. Haryana Agro Industries Corporation Limited (HAICL) will allot one franchise of 200 sq ft area for a village with a population of 3,000, at least one for each ward in the municipal corporation and at least one in a group of wards having a cumulative population of 10,000 in municipal committee/council. The HAICL has signed terms of trade (TOT) with 51 corporate houses which would provide their quality products to these stores, enabled with a complete IT support system for smooth operations. “With the opening of these stores, the state government’s model of making youths job givers instead of job seekers will also be accomplished,” said CM Khattar after inaugurating a store during a programme held at Panchkula. According to Khattar, these stores will provide a platform to youth franchisees as well as micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), government cooperative institutions, FPOs (farmer producer organisations) and self help groups (SHGs) to increase their business. Franchise policy launched The CM also launched the Franchise Policy under which, those interested can apply as per the terms and conditions. People in the age group of 18-35, women, persons with disabilities and those verified under Mukhyamantri Parivar Uthan Yojana will be given preference.Priority will also be given to young members of families having annual income less than ₹1.80 lakh and verified under Parivar Pehchan Patra scheme. Khattar said now people can apply for these stores and the target is to open 100 stores in two months. A monthly income of at least ₹15,000 will be ensured for those verified under the Mukhyamantri Parivar Uthan Yojana and operating these stores. “As per the sale provision made in the Har Hith store scheme, the franchisee partner who sells products worth ₹1,50,000 will earn a marginal profit of 10%, that is ₹15,000,” said Khattar. If any youth whose verified family annual income is less than ₹1.80 lakh and is unable to earn ₹15,000 in the first six months, then the state government will provide financial help. “If the youth is able to earn ₹12,000, the government will give him ₹3,000 as financial aid, if the income is above ₹13,000, the government will provide compensation of ₹2,000 and so on. The state government will ensure that his minimum income comes to ₹15,000,” the CM said. If the applicant of the franchise is financially weak, Khattar said, the state government will provide loan facility under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana without any guarantee. “Making Haryana ‘Berojgar Mukt, Rozgar Yukt’ by 2024 is our target and opening of these stores is a step in the direction of Atmanirbhar Bharat,” said Khattar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/khattar-launches-har-hith-store-scheme-aims-to-wipe-out-unemployment-by-2024-101627937788428.html
03-08-2021||Chandigarh||Virus still down in Haryana but may raise its head again soon, say experts||The Covid-19 trajectory in Haryana continued its downward trend for the 12th week in a row even as the state reported a meagre increase in the number of positive cases last week. Experts said that the infection rate which has been at the lowest ever for the past five weeks is expected to go up in the coming days. The transmission of infection is expected to pick up gradually because of the lifting of lockdown restrictions, including opening of educational institutions, offices, shops, malls, eateries and allowing more people to attend social events. After reopening schools, the state government is contemplating to start academic session in universities too. Health officials said they were keeping their fingers crossed. Last week (July 26-Aug 1), the state reported 203 infections as compared to 200 the week before. Additional chief secretary, health, Rajeev Arora said this was an insignificant increase considering the fact that 1.67 lakh persons were tested for the infection last week. “However, we need to be watchful and not lower our guard,” he said.The dwindling numbers are unprecedented during a spell of decrease in the transmission of infection, data shows.The positivity rate for the second wave of infection (from March 1 to August 1) has also declined significantly. It was 9.55% this Monday as compared to 9.86% last Monday.Also, the daily positivity rate which went as high as 27% during the second wave in April-May, has come down to as low as 0.07%. The devastating second wave of virus transmission saw 4.21 lakh infections and more than 4,200 fatalities in a period of six weeks during April-May. Across 22 districts there were only 703 active cases as on August 2 with Hisar being the sole district to have more than 100 active cases. Sixteen districts continued to have less than 50 active cases. Nineteen persons died last week due to the viral infection. Nine districts continued to be out of critical positivity rate category having a cumulative positivity rate of less than 6%. The remaining 13 are also experiencing a decline in the cumulative positivity rate with Yamunanagar, Bhiwani and Sirsa districts closing in to exit the critical category if the downward trend continues for couple of more weeks, health officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/virus-still-down-in-haryana-but-may-raise-its-head-again-soon-say-experts-101627937308266.html

The city’s population is 12.4 million, according to the census of 2011. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s data shows between January 16 and July 31, 7,223,853 vaccine doses have been administered and 1,771,396 citizens are fully vaccinated. Of the 1.7 million fully vaccinated citizens, 742,758 are in the 45-59 age group, 619,871 are senior citizens above 60 years of age and 101,733 are in the 18-45 age group. Further, 425,202 vaccine doses have also been administered to frontline and health care workers, of which 292,829 citizens are fully vaccinated. According to BMC officials, they have the capacity to vaccinate 100,000 citizens on a daily basis, provided that many vaccine doses are supplied. HT had on July 29 reported how the city has reported a 23% drop in the number of vaccinations conducted in the first 28 days of July (1,499,125) compared to June (1,949,878), according to data. The data reveals that vaccination at public centres has increased marginally in July compared to June, but the vaccination at private hospitals has seen a significant fall of around 50%. Experts, on the other hand, say the current speed of vaccination should be increased in order to have more relaxations. Dr Madhav Sathe, a microbiology professor at Nair Hospital’s college, said, “We need to increase the speed of vaccination. However, if you may ask our epidemiologist, they may say that over 5 million citizens are probably exposed to Covid-19. As we have around 0.7 million Covid cases, when we multiply their contacts, the number comes to 3.5 million.” Dr Sathe added, “This means at least 3.5 million citizens have directly or indirectly got infected to Covid-19. On top of this, you add 1.7 million fully vaccinated and considering that around 0.2 million are non-residents of Mumbai, we will be able to infer here that around 5 million citizens are directly or indirectly protected as they may have antibodies. To have major relaxations in lockdown, around 80% of the citizens have developed antibodies. Post this, we can allow citizens to travel in trains, watch movies in theatres, etc. Even now, fully vaccinated citizens should be allowed to use trains.” Meanwhile, on Monday, 77,511 citizens were vaccinated in the city, and 62 bedridden citizens were vaccinated as part of BMC’s door-to-door drive. Gangadharan Balachandran, 102, was among the bedridden citizens vaccinated. He is a resident of K-East ward, and was administered Covaxin. No adverse effects were reported.Due to shortage of vaccine doses, on Tuesday, all public vaccination centres will not remain functional. The BMC will issue a list on social media by Tuesday early morning. On Wednesday, it is expected that the centres will remain closed considering the fresh stock will arrive on Tuesday and distribution process will be carried out on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/10-citizens-are-fully-vaccinated-in-mumbai-101627935868591.html

Saini, however, was not found at his residence. The operation was so secret that even the senior officials of the bureau were unaware about it, it is learnt. The case against Saini and seven others was registered under prevention of corruption Act in a case pertaining to sale of a property in a Mohali village. Vigilance SP Gagan Ajit Singh led the search party that comprised more 40 police officials. High drama prevailed outside Saini’s house as the raiding team was not allowed to enter the house by the ex-DGP’s security staff for nearly two hours. The staff kept on asking for warrants. According to officials, the raiding team was very sure about Saini’s presence in the house. The vigilance team even brought a private person to open the locks of the main entry door of the house but could not do as after strong protest by Ramandeep Singh Sandhu, a member of Saini’s legal team. The local SHO was called on insistence of Saini’s staff and after his arrival just four members of the raiding team were allowed to enter the house. The raid was on till filing of the report. Saini, who is said to be earlier staying in the house on rent, had later bought it from a private person. According to the bureau’s probe, one Jaspal bought the property but it was actually purchased by Saini, who was retired and was shown to have taken the house on rent after renovations in October 2018. The bureau claimed no money in the shape of rent was ever received. Instead, 6.4 crore were paid by Saini to Jaspal without any sale agreement. Jaspal and other accused have got bail from HC in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vigilance-books-punjab-ex-top-cop-saini-in-assets-case-raids-his-chandigarh-residence-101627935692644.html
03-08-2021||Mumbai||2nd Covid-19 wave: Infections among citizens aged above 50 dip in Mumbai||The second wave of Covid-19 has seen fewer infections among Mumbaiites above the age of 50 years, when compared to the figures before March, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) data has revealed. The second wave started in March, and experts and authorities believe it is presently on its decline. According to figures from BMC, of the 321,581 cumulative Covid-19 cases till March, the age group of 50 years and above had a share of 44% or 141,076 cases. It dropped to 39% (278,687 cases) by the end of July. Of the cumulative Covid-19 cases so far, the age-wise data is available with BMC for 707,367 cases as on July 31. Moreover, until March 2, the 50-59 age group reported the highest number of Covid-19 cases (63,081) among all the age groups. However, by July 31, the age group of 30-30 years reported the highest cases (141,456), as per BMC data. Officials and experts have attributed the drop in infections among those aged above 50 to early vaccination of this high risk age-group, increased awareness – especially during the ‘My Family, My Responsibility campaign – and the restrictions imposed in city. A senior civic official said, “Vaccines are effective in reducing instances of infection, and even its severity. Vaccination drive for senior citizens and those above 45 years of age started in March, which shielded them to some extent.” A BMC survey revealed that of the 300,000 surveyed patients who were infected in the second wave, only 26 patients who had taken both doses of the vaccine were infected, while 10,500 patients had received their first shot. The official quoted above said, “The restrictions imposed across the state also helped our case, as only those with the real need to step out of the house could do so.” Dr Rahul Pandit, who is a part of the state Covid-19 task force, said, “Vaccinating against Covid-19 is effective. It is seen even in case studies around the world during the Covid-19 pandemic. In cases where people get infected despite taking a vaccine shot, the severity of the infection is lesser.” So far, 5,504,338 beneficiaries in Mumbai have received their first dose and 1,797,026 beneficiaries have been fully vaccinated. The city has 624,772 fully vaccinated beneficiaries who are senior citizens, and 1,002,011 who have received their first dose. In the age group of 45-59 years, 756,502 beneficiaries have been fully vaccinated so far, and 1,465,293 have got their first dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/2nd-covid-19-wave-infections-among-citizens-aged-above-50-dip-in-mumbai-101627935688089.html
03-08-2021||Mumbai||‘Will approach Prez, PM to get nod for travel on Mumbai’s local trains’||Local train passengers on Monday stated that the citizens will suffer even more and it will soon become impossible to survive as the Maharashtra government has decided to continue denying permission to the general public to travel by local trains. Passengers associations’ have said that the Maharashtra government has left them with no choice but to approach the President and Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PM) to intervene in the issue so that local train services are resumed for all citizens. “I reside in Dombivli which is on the Central Railway network. My workplace is at Mahim on Western line. I am a senior citizen and the lockdown has crippled me. Can’t essential services staffers and government employees, who are allowed to commute by suburban trains anytime, transmit coronavirus? Is there any logic? Are only they free from pandemic or non-transmissions and are rest of the classes transmitters. The lockdown should be eased step-by-step, specifically to commute by local trains at stipulated timings, as was allowed earlier in order to have so that our lives are brought to motion and not left to die by starvation,” said Dombivli resident CK Balasubramanian. “We have been constantly requesting them [the state government] humbly to resume local train services for the general public. They have not paid any heed to this. In the coming days, this decision will be disastrous. We have no option left and will be approaching PM, asking him to help,” said Subhash Gupta, president of passengers’ body Rail Yatri Parishad. Associations also cited that as fully vaccinated passengers can travel by air, they should also be allowed to travel on local trains. “Airlines have started operating, and fully vaccinated passengers can travel without coronavirus-negative certificates. Then why can’t vaccinated citizens commute by local trains. Every day, the situation is getting grim with no respite from the state government. We will urge the President and PM to speak to the Maharashtra government,” said Lata Argade, secretary, Suburban Railway Passenger Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/will-approach-prez-pm-to-get-nod-for-travel-on-mumbai-s-local-trains-101627935268277.html
03-08-2021||Mumbai||Why not allow fully vaccinated citizens to travel by trains: HC to Maharashtra govt||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday asked the Maharashtra government to consider setting up dedicated counters at railways stations to provide identity cards and travel passes to all those persons who are fully vaccinated. The suggestion was prompted after the state informed the bench that it had decided to issue monthly, quarterly and six monthly railway passes to lawyers only after the bar associations concerned issued certificates confirming that the lawyer had been vaccinated and was fit to travel by suburban locals by observing Covid-19 protocols. The court, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by various lawyer groups, sought to know why access to public transport should be restricted to only lawyers while all persons who are fully vaccinated are denied the same. The court held that other persons also need to go out and earn a living but due to the restrictions on train travel have to opt for other modes of public transport which are already burdened and affected due to road and traffic conditions. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing PILs filed by the Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa (BCMG) and other lawyer groups, was informed by senior counsel Milind Sathe that they were seeking limited directions to the state government to consider around 1,000 practicing advocates as essential service providers and allowing them to travel by local trains to attend court and for other professional purposes. While responding to the PIL, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni for the state informed the bench that a meeting of representatives of BCMG, state and Central governments with railway officials had been held recently. A tentative formula wherein lawyers wanting to travel by local trains had to approach the bar associations concerned and show their vaccination certificates based on which the association would issue them a certificate which they could produce at railway booking offices to secure passes. Kumbhakoni, however, added that the railway authorities were requesting a letter from the state disaster management authority (SDMA) recommending this, but as the authority was headed by the chief minister who was slightly reluctant, only frontline health workers and certain government employees were permitted to take local trains at this stage. Kumbhakoni, however, assured the court that efforts were on to avail the letter from CM, who was visiting the flood-affected areas in the state. After hearing the submissions, the court sought to why people should stay home after being vaccinated. “They are supposed to work and earn their livelihoods. Courts have begun functioning physically, lawyers will go to courts. Railways are cooperating. Let us have a beginning not just for lawyers, but for people from other walks of lives too. Spread the net wide. We are concerned for lawyers and for others as well,” observed the court.The bench then asked why the population travelling by buses could not be allowed to travel by trains. “It takes three hours one way to Dahisar [from south Mumbai]. Why is the entire population travelling by road cannot travel by train?” questioned the bench. The bench further said that there was an urgent need to come out with a plan as it was affecting the lives and finances of people and hence the railways should consider having dedicated counters to verify whether aspiring commuters were fully vaccinated and issue them identity cards.The court asked the state to inform its decision for access to local trains to lawyers and vaccinated persons by Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/why-not-allow-fully-vaccinated-citizens-to-travel-by-trains-hc-to-maharashtra-govt-101627934908175.html
03-08-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19 orphans 490 children in Maharashtra||The Covid-19 pandemic has claimed more than 130,000 lives in the state and has severely impacted the lives of the children. In Maharashtra, 15,793 have lost one parent to Covid-19, while nearly 490 have become orphans, revealed the data compiled by the department of women and child development (WCD).Neelam Navale, 10, contracted Covid-19 in April along with her elder brother, Sunil, 15, and both their parents— Ramakant and Ankita. On April 13, Ramakant’s oxygen saturation dropped to 89% and he was immediately admitted to the district hospital. But he succumbed to the infection within 24 hours. Even before the family could cope up with their loss, Ankita also had to be rushed to the hospital’s intensive care unit (ICU) on April 15 due to breathlessness. She breathed her last on April 25. It was only in June that the relatives told the children about their parents’ deaths.“Neelam is too young to understand the loss but Sunil has been left completely traumatised,” said their aunt Renuka Ojha. At present, the children are staying with their uncle in Banaras, Uttar Pradesh. These are not isolated stories. Covid-19 has devastated families across the state, orphaning many children that include 267 males and 223 female children have lost their parents in the state. The highest number of deaths was recorded in the second wave which started from mid-February. The highest number of orphaned children have been recorded in Pune division (106), followed by Konkan division (104), Nashik division (94), Nagpur division (86), Aurangabad division (62) and Amravati (32). Pune and Nagpur districts have 21 orphan children each — the highest in the state, followed by Thane and Solapur districts with 15 children. These districts have recorded the highest cases of Covid-19, especially in the second wave. As more men have contracted the infection, the death rate is also higher among them. This has also been reflected in WCD’s data. A total of 13,540 fathers have lost died due to Covid-19, while 1,763 mothers have succumbed to the infection in the state. “The latest national sero survey report released by the Union health ministry showed that the sero prevalence was more in women. This indicates that the infection rate is higher among women but the death rate is more among men. In our hospital, we have witnessed a higher fatality rate among men, which can be attributed to various reasons,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair Hospital at Mumbai Central. Acting on the Supreme Court’s direction, the state constituted task forces in each district to identify such children and avert their trafficking and illegal adoptions. Women and child welfare officials have reached out to families that reported Covid-19 deaths and provided counselling, legal and financial aid to them. The process for enrolment of orphaned children, whose extended family members are not able to look after them, is ongoing. IA Kundan, secretary, WCD, said that district-level task forces have been appointed under the chairmanship of district collectors who are helping these children financially and psychologically through child welfare committees. “We had to identify those children, so we collected the data district-wise. We have got in touch with all the children and have provided counselling in tie-ups with professional psychiatrics,” she added. Earlier, WCD minister Yashomati Thakur had informed HT that the department has taken full responsibility of the further studies of such children for which technological support in the form of laptops and android phones are being provided to them as immediate steps. Thakur added, “We have already announced ₹5 lakh in fixed deposit accounts of these children till they turn 18. Until then, financial aid will be given to children under Balsangopan Yojana.” Children in custody of relatives are given financial assistance of ₹1,125 per month under the Bal Sangopan scheme.In the past few months, there have been several messages circulating on social media for adoption of children who have been orphaned due to Covid-19. WCD has requested the public to refrain from circulating such messages as ‘unauthorised’ adoption can lead to child trafficking. “There are due processes that need to be followed for adoption. If anyone wants to adopt such an orphan child, they need to contact us,” said Kundan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-orphans-490-children-in-maharashtra-101627934608063.html
03-08-2021||Mumbai||We have channels for movies, why not have one for education? asks Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday directed the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) and the National Council for Education, Research and Training (NCERT) to consider having dedicated television and radio channels for education, especially to cater to the needs of differently-abled students who do not have access to education due to technological and mobile connectivity issues. The court said as many regions had connectivity issues and students do not necessarily have smart phones to attend classes through online meeting platforms, and as most households had television and radio sets, the need of the hour was to fall back on past technologies to ensure that the differently-abled students did not lose out on the academic year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the National Association for the Blind (NAB). During the course of hearing, advocate Uday Warunjikar –who represented the petitioner body – informed the bench that visually impaired students had been deprived of education during the pandemic and the state and Central governments should be directed to formulate policies to provide the same. Warunjikar submitted that students attending normal schools had been getting education through online learning mode. However, many regions in the state, especially rural areas, do not have proper connectivity, as a result of which online classes could not be conducted and there was an apprehension that there would be a loss of the entire academic year.This, he said, was more of a concern for specially-abled students as out of the 200 schools for the visually impaired in the state, very few had the wherewithal for online education. He added that though the state had started televised classes through the channel DD Sahyadri, it did not suffice for specially-abled students.On a query from the court on how the state was imparting education to specially-abled and other students in rural areas, assistant government pleader Reena Salunke responded that both students were being provided education through online meeting platforms such as Google Meet and Zoom. She added that areas which had network issues, teachers were making home visits. However, the court observed that connectivity issues in rural areas was a pertinent problem and suggested that there should be dedicated education channel on television and radio for all students. The bench then asked advocate Rui Rodrigues for NCERT to speak with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) to consider the court’s suggestion and asked the Centre and state to explore imparting education through Doordarshan and Akashwani. “We have dedicated TV channels that show live proceedings of Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha and in the near future we may have live streaming of judicial proceedings too. Then why can’t there be devoted channels for education, not only for specially-abled students but even for those who have suffered. We have to go back to old technology now as the network issue will continue,” observed the court. “There are hundreds of channels for movies and entertainment, not one for education. We cannot have only colleges, schools and no academics. People in rural areas might not have funds to buy smartphones, but they need to get access to education,” added the bench. The bench has sought MIB’s feedback by the next hearing on Thursday and asked it to not wait for the court order to implement such a decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/we-have-channels-for-movies-why-not-have-one-for-education-asks-bombay-hc-101627934129049.html
03-08-2021||Chandigarh||2 Punjabi varsity staffers among 7 booked in fake billing scam||Police on Monday registered a case against seven persons, including two Punjabi University employees, in the fake billing scam in the varsity. The accused also include those shown as beneficiaries withdrawing funds through fake bills. The seven who were booked are varsity employees Nishu Chaudhary, a senior assistant, and Jatinder Singh besides Akashdeep Singh, Sonu Kumar, Harpreet Singh, Vinay and Nisha Sharma. In May, the varsity authorities had suspended two of its employees for their alleged involvement in the scam and then lodged a police complaint against the seven a month later. Patiala senior superintendent of police (SSP) Sandeep Garg had directed DSP Sourav Jindal to investigate the matter. The case was registered under sections 420 (cheating), 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant), 465 (for making forged documents), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged), 201 (tampering with evidence) and 381 (theft) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).DSP Jindal said, “The FIR was lodged on the basis of a preliminary inquiry. Now, detailed investigation will be carried into the matter. The accused will be arrested soon.” In May, the cash-strapped university’s internal audit department and finance wing had red-flagged five bills amounting to ₹6 lakh. The stamp and signatures of the department head were found to be fake and the names of research scholars and assistants against whom the bills were raised also turned out to be bogus. A committee comprising registrar Varinder Kaushik, dean (research) Ashok Tiwari and finance officer Rakesh Khurana probed the bank accounts of the senior assistant and the others involved. The help of the university’s forensic department was taken to investigate the fake signatures and stamps. According to the committee report, the senior assistant, who handled the funds provided to the university under various heads and was posted in the same department for over a decade, used to create and submit bogus bills in the name of fake research scholars and assistants to siphon off money. The funds included those provided by the University Grants Commission (UGC) for development schemes, non-UGC grant for research projects and scholarships given by the Union ministry of education besides those received under the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan. The embezzlement went unchecked for six years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2-punjabi-varsity-staffers-among-7-booked-in-fake-billing-scam-101627934128024.html

Famers have been protesting at the dry port entrance since January over the Centre’s agriculture laws. Rajiv Kumar, who was working as a transport manager in the inland container depot, said he was asked to proceed on leave without pay on July 25. Talking over phone, Rajiv said, “I cannot blame the company as they paid us salaries for nearly seven months. With no possibility of resuming of business, we were asked to leave. I have two children. I don’t know whether I will get another job due to the dwindling economic situation.”Basant Singh, a resident of Mandi Ahmedgarh who worked as a horticulturist with the firm said, “I was hired at a salary of ₹15,500 and was getting ₹12,000 in hand. Nearly 150 residents of Punjab were working in the depot. Will the Samyukt Kisan Morcha take the responsibility of safeguarding the future of our children.” An official said the depot had 400 employees on roll while 500-600 workers from surrounding villages were working as daily wagers. “The daily wagers were earning up to 15,000 a month,” he added. On Monday, the farmers continued their protest outside the dry port by placing tractor-trailers and tents at the entrance. Raghbir Singh Benipal, a member of the SKM, said the protest was only against the crony capitalists who were behind the implementation of three farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/adani-dry-port-closure-employees-blame-skm-for-rendering-them-jobless-101627934076968.html

The protests are being organised simultaneously when the farmer unions have been holding indefinite protests at the Delhi borders to oppose the farm laws. In Barnala, the protesters staged dharnas at the Badbar toll plaza on the Bathinda-Chandigarh national highway and Mehal Kalan village on the Barnala-Ludhiana road since October 1. In Sangrur, protests were held at the Kalajhar toll barrier on the Chandigarh-Bathinda national highway and th toll plaza at Ladda village on the Sangrur-Ludhiana road. The Badbar and Kalajhar toll plazas were being run by the same company which completed its contract and left the possession a couple of months back.Protests are being held outside Reliance fuel stations at Manna Pindi and Sanghera villages in Barnala. In Sangrur, the farmers organised dharnas in front of Reliance fuel stations at Kheri, Dhuri and Lehal Khurd villages.Reliance Group officials said 19 of their fuel stations are under siege and the company is facing huge losses in Punjab.Sangrur block chief of BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) Gobinder Singh said the farmers will continue protests outside the premises of the corporate houses till the central government repeals the three laws. “When people fight for a cause, one has to face some losses on other fronts,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-continue-siege-of-toll-plazas-reliance-fuel-stations-in-punjab-101627934068960.html
03-08-2021||Chandigarh||Suicide victim naming a person must be probed with all seriousness: HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has said that a person levelling allegations of abetment against other persons before committing suicide ought to be probed with all seriousness.The court was hearing a petition of a Rewari woman who along with her husband was named by a person in his suicide note. They borrowed ₹11 lakh from the victim in 2018 but when he asked them to return the money, they threatened to get him killed or frame in a case after making excuses for a while, it was alleged in the suicide note. The man committed suicide on June 10, 2020. The woman named in the note admitted to having a dispute with the victim but argued that there was no scope of abetment on her part as she never harassed him. Dismissing her plea for anticipatory bail, the bench of Justice HS Madaan said, “Human beings are in awe of death. Even the older people want to live longer. It is only under certain compelling circumstances that a person ends his/her life. If a person committing suicide holds someone else responsible for forcing him/her to take the extreme step, such statement is needs to be taken up with all the seriousness.” “It is difficult to understand why a person leaving this mortal world by ending his life himself would blame an innocent person,” the bench added. The court observed that the petitioner was specifically named in the suicide note with incriminating acts attributed to her. “The suicide note was examined by the investigation agency and the handwriting was that of the deceased as per experts,” it said. The court further observed that the aspects such as denial of abetment by the woman and determining the guilt of the accused will be looked into by the trial court. “This court is to examine the prosecution version primarily. Pre-arrest bail is a discretionary relief and is to be granted in exceptional cases. It is meant to save the innocent persons from harassment and inconvenience and not to save the culprits from arrest and custodial interrogation. The woman’s custodial interrogation is necessary for complete and effective investigation so as to find out as to how and under what circumstances she abetted the suicide,” the bench added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/suicide-victim-naming-a-person-must-be-probed-with-all-seriousness-hc-101627934008107.html
03-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra Highway Police send 3.1K licences of Mumbai motorists for suspension||The Maharashtra Highway Police has sent a proposal to the road transport department to suspend around 40,305 driving licences of motorists for three to six months. These include 3,149 driving licences from Mumbai, where 265,000 traffic offences have been registered. “The motorists in these cases face licence suspension for at least three months,” said a police officer. After the suspension orders are issued, the licence concerned will be seized by the police and released only after the suspension period is over. “We have sent a proposal to suspend driving licences of motorists who are found repeating traffic offences. Most of the offences are speaking on phone while driving, signal jumping, drunk driving and driving on the wrong side,” said Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay, additional director general of police, traffic. Upadhyay said the stern action of suspending driving licences is being taken as per suggestions by the Apex court’s road safety committee headed by justice KS Radhakrishnan. The police officer said around 1.47 million traffic offences have been registered this year in the state. On analysing the information, the traffic police department found that the accused included 40,305 repeat offenders, after which a decision was taken to send their licences for suspension. Of the 40,305 repeat offenders, 23,144 motorists have been repeatedly found speaking on phone while driving. Last year, 9,465 offenders were found speaking on phone while driving. There are 13,550 motorists whose licences have been sent for suspension for jumping signals. Last year, officials had sent around 4,888 driving licences for suspension, said an official. Around 1,887 drivers’ licences will be suspended this year for carrying passengers in goods vehicles. Officials said they have sent 1,776 licences for suspension for over speeding – 1,450 more than the number of licences referred for suspension last year. The officers said this year, drunk driving is the only category that saw a decrease in cases as only 448 licences have been sent for suspension. Last year the police had sent 1,995 driving licences for suspension for drunk driving. Mumbai traffic police have not send any licence for suspension for drunk driving this year as the campaign for drunk driving has been stopped owing to Covid-19 guidelines If the police suspect that a person is driving under the influence of alcohol, they take the driver for a medical test. “We have sent 2,167 and 982 licences for cancellation for jumping signals and talking on phone while driving, respectively,” said a Mumbai Police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-highway-police-send-3-1k-licences-of-mumbai-motorists-for-suspension-101627933768149.html
03-08-2021||Mumbai||Non-Covid surgeries, OPDs slowly gain momentum at Mumbai hospitals||With a steady decline in the Covid-19 cases in Mumbai, non-Covid medical procedures and visits at out-patient departments (OPDs) are slowly gaining momentum. Doctors said that the number of surgeries and OPD visits are yet to go back to the pre-Covid times, but there has been an uptick over the past month. “We have resumed about 80% of the non-Covid work,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, the dean of the civic-run BYL Nair Hospital that was converted into an exclusive Covid-19 facility last April. The hospital had commissioned all its 1,100 regular beds and 110 intensive care unit (ICU) beds for Covid-19 patients. “As the cases kept declining, we gradually decommissioned the Covid-19 beds, first reducing them to 700, then to 500, and so on. We currently have only 100 Covid-19 beds and 40 ICU beds for Covid,” said Dr Bharmal. In the pre-Covid times, the hospital carried out anywhere between 100 and 150 major and minor procedures daily. It is now conducting about 50-75 procedures. The civic-run KEM Hospital in Parel carried out nearly 300 major and minor procedures every day in the pre-Covid period. It is now conducting about 200 to 215 procedures. “Our OPDs had a footfall of about 5,000-7,000 patients every day, Mondays seeing the highest numbers every week,” said Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of the hospital. “The OPD numbers are still down by 20%,” he said. While KEM Hospital caters to a large number of people from the city, it also receives patients from the peripheral areas. According to Dr Deshmukh, transportation is a major hurdle and even as people are allowed to take local trains for medical reasons, the footfall in the hospitals has been low. “There is still some amount of fear to step into hospitals. Those waiting for elective surgeries like hernias or joint replacements are rarely scheduling their procedures,” said Dr Deshmukh. KEM Hospital received some of the most serious Covid-19 patients when the first and second peaks of the pandemic hit the city. While serious patients are still referred to the hospitals, the civic body has kept the jumbo facilities operational to take the load of mild to moderate Covid-19 patients to let hospitals like Nair and KEM pick up the pace of non-Covid work. Private centres, too, are recording similar trends. For instance, Andheri’s Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital (KDAH) has resumed almost 75% of the non-Covid services. The number of daily procedures at the hospital now hovers around 40-45 from the average of 50-55 before Covid-19 outbreak. During the peaks of the pandemic, the hospital still managed to carry out 15 to 20 non-Covid procedures, including emergency surgeries. “Many of our patients come from out of Mumbai. With the travel restrictions and lack of clarity about rules, such patients have reduced,” said Dr Santosh Shetty, chief executive officer of KDAH. “Nearly 15% of our work has now shifted online,” he said. Hospitals are hopeful that the general services will resume as more people get vaccinated. “We are gradually seeing an increase in patients visiting the hospital for consultations and we expect these numbers to rise further with the increase in vaccinations,” said Dr Rajeev Boudhankar, chief executive officer of Bhatia Hospital. The hospital has segregated its Covid-19 and non-Covid areas, designated separate lifts for non-Covid patients and has also created a Covid-19 operation theatre for minor surgeries of coronavirus patients. Before the pandemic, Bhatia Hospital had a daily OPD footfall of 150 patients and it conducted around 15 procedures. Since April, the hospital has been carrying out about seven to 10 surgeries per day and has a footfall of about 65 patients in OPDs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/noncovid-surgeries-opds-slowly-gain-momentum-at-mumbai-hospitals-101627933468074.html

03-08-2021||Mumbai||HC questions Centre, Maharashtra govt on incorrect details on vax certificates||The Bombay high court (HC) has questioned the Centre and state to explain how some beneficiaries of the vaccination ended up with certificates issued through the CoWin app having same dates and batch numbers for both jabs. The court also asked the authorities to inform how the error would be rectified to avoid “harassment” to the beneficiaries. The HC also directed the Centre and the state to enumerate the method of distribution of vaccines after it was informed that the vaccination drive in Maharashtra had seen a drop in the past month due to shortage of supply. The court asked the governments to file affidavits regarding the same. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a citizen Yogeeta Rajesh Vanzara, was informed by advocate Jamsheed Master that people faced several issues related to CoWin app and sought directions seeking ease of its operation, especially for the elderly. The bench had also ordered clubbing of another PIL filed by Mumbai-based lawyer Siddharth Chandrashekhar, wherein advocate Anita Shekhar-Castellino had pointed to the issues faced while booking slots on the CoWin portal and priority vaccination slots for the elderly. In the hearing on July 17, the bench had asked the Centre to file an affidavit on how vaccines were being allocated to different states and what was the procedure and time limit assigned to each manufacturer to supply them. On Monday, while perusing the affidavit filed by the Centre, the court observed that its queries had not been answered to a large extent. “We are concerned to observe that the deponent of such an affidavit was not serious,” the court noted and asked the Union Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) to file a better reply, indicating distribution of vaccines to Maharashtra.Additional government pleader Geeta Shastri for the state informed the bench that Maharashtra continued to face shortage of vaccines from the Centre and while it had nearly 90 million persons eligible for vaccination, 33 million had got one jab, while 11 million people had received both. The court was further informed that while nearly 2 million in the city were due to receive the second jab, only 500,000-700,000 jabs were being provided on a daily basis. Thereafter, Castellino pointed out that that some citizens, who got Covishield, were issued vaccination certificates with errors such as incorrect names, batch number of vaccine received and in some cases the date of both the doses was printed the same. She submitted that as there was no means to rectify such errors it could result in certificates of such persons being doubted, leading to harassment and hence the court should intervene. “We want the Centre and state to explain how such defective certificates could be generated and what could be the procedure for having them corrected. We issue general directions. In case such difficulties are seen in future, immediate steps should be taken to make corrections and actual date and names be mentioned in the certificate,” noted the bench. The court also asked the state to formulate a procedure to vaccinate people who were not registered on CoWin as it did not want anyone to be left out from being vaccinated. Seeking Centre’s response on state-wise distribution of vaccines and to making rectification in vaccine certificates by August 9 and state government’s reply to the plea by August 13, the court posted the further hearing to August 23. ‘Is 3rd dose needed?’HC asked the Maharashtra government if the third dose or a booster shot of Covid-19 vaccine was required to be taken by citizens who have already received two jabs. The division bench headed by chief justice Dipankar Datta referred to the disclosure of Dr Sanjay Oak, head of state Covid-19 task force, wherein he had informed HC’s administrative committee that people with two doses may require a third shot to protect themselves from several variants of the virus. While asking advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni regarding Dr Oak’s statement, the bench said, “Will a third dose be required to be taken 10 months from the second Covishield dose and six months from the second dose of Covaxin? Get a response from the Covid-19 task force as to how far the third dose is necessary. It should not happen that we are happy with the second dose, but there is an increase [in cases].”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-questions-centre-maharashtra-govt-on-incorrect-details-on-vax-certificates-101627932747929.html
03-08-2021||Chandigarh||SC rejects former trial judge’s plea challenging compulsory retirement||The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a plea of a former additional sessions judge seeking quashing of a decision of the full court of the Punjab and Haryana high court to recommend his “compulsory retirement”, saying there were “multiple transactions showing deposits and withdrawals of substantial amounts of money”. The apex court judgement came on a plea of Rajinder Goel, the then additional sessions judge in Haryana, seeking setting aside of the recommendation of December 14, 2020, of the full court of the Punjab and Haryana high court recommending his compulsory retirement. The former judge had also challenged the consequential order of January 5, 2021, of the Haryana governor accepting the recommendation alleging that the full court took the punitive action despite the fact that the two reports of the vigilance/disciplinary committee had exonerated him. “Considering the facts and circumstances on record and in view of the record indicating that there were multiple transactions showing deposits and withdrawals of substantial amounts of money, it cannot be said that the full court was not justified in taking the view that it did. We do not find any reason to take a different view in the matter,” said a bench of justices Uday Umesh Lalit and Ajay Rastogi in the judgement. The apex court, which had advised the former judge to approach the high court with his grievances first, later did not accede to the request saying now it has already reserved the judgement after hearing the parties. “It must be stated that the petition was heard and the order was reserved on July 27, 2021. Next day, an application was preferred submitting that the petitioner be allowed to withdraw the instant petition with further liberty to approach the high court invoking its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. Since the suggestion made by this Court as stated earlier was not accepted after due instructions from the petitioner, we reject the prayer,” said justice Lalit who, wrote the judgement for the bench. Goel, who had joined the Haryana Judicial Services in 1996, was promoted in 2008 to the Haryana Superior Judicial Services and later certain complaints, including the one by the Bar Association, were made against him.A preliminary report of April 21, 2011, had found that there was no documentary evidence regarding allegations of land purchases. However, it had observed that there were “heavy unexplained bank transactions”.Two reports of the vigilance/disciplinary committee found that the charges levelled against Goel were not proved and recommended that he be cleared of all the charges.The matter was placed before the full court, which in its meeting, deliberated upon reports and rejected them. “It is resolved that major penalty of compulsory retirement be imposed upon the delinquent Officer under Rule 4(1)(viii) of the Haryana Civil Services (Punishment and Appeal) Rules, 1987..., and a recommendation be made to the Government of Haryana that the Officer be compulsorily retired from service with immediate effect,” the full Court had opined. The top court also rejected the submission of Goel that the Full Court was bound by the findings of the vigilance or inquiry committees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sc-rejects-former-trial-judge-s-plea-challenging-compulsory-retirement-101627932628001.html
03-08-2021||Chandigarh||Affidavit stating no higher court approached must in bail matters||The Punjab and Haryana high court has made it mandatory that in each bail matter before trial courts, an accused will have to give an affidavit that for similar relief, higher courts have not been approached. If an application, which does not contain the said information, it would not be entertained and would be returned for resubmission with the necessary information, the high court has directed.The directions to trial courts in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh courts were issued by the bench of justice Manjari Nehru Kaul while dealing with a matter in which a bail plea was pending in high court but the accused by “concealing” the said fact approached trial court and secured bail.The court also said that public prosecutors / prosecuting agency would be duty bound to apprise the court concerned, after collecting the necessary information from the investigating officers with respect to the filing of any petition before any court seeking bail. In case of any lapse/default on the part of the investigating agency/prosecution, it would be construed to be a “fraud” played upon the court, which could invite departmental as well as penal action against the erring parties/officials, as the case may be, the court recorded asking registrar general to circulate this order to all concerned for information, and necessary and strict compliance in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/affidavit-stating-no-higher-court-approached-must-in-bail-matters-101627932508311.html
03-08-2021||Mumbai||Man who helped Mumbai cops solve break-in case held for ₹1.8 crore theft||A 21-old man who had helped police crack a house break-in case in south Mumbai has been alleged to have carried out a theft at his employer’s house in Bhulabhai Desai road near Breach Candy Hospital and fleeing with valuables worth ₹1.8 crore to Bihar. “He had helped us solve a break-in case that had taken place at a businessman’s house in our jurisdiction by tipping us about the accused. He worked with us for a long time during the investigation, which helped him understand our functioning,” said an officer from Gamdevi police station.After this, the accused had decided to carry out the break-in at his employer’s house. On July 5, a theft had taken place at the home of a bath fittings dealer when the family had gone to Lonavala for a function. The accused had fled with diamond and gold jewellery and cash, all collectively worth ₹1.8 crore.“The accused had not used his phone nor was he captured in any of the CCTV cameras. He had made sure that the cameras did not capture him,” said an officer from Gamdevi police station.However, in the routine inquiry, the police started questioning all the domestic helps of the house and found that one of them – Chandan Mukhia – who had been working with the family for the past three months, had went missing.“We started searching for him and minor details lead us to reach a small village under the Darbhanga Sonki police station’s jurisdiction in Bihar,” said the police officer.However, the cops did not find the accused at his village.“We stayed in Darbhanga for 24 days and finally traced Mukhia to his sister’s house in a nearby village. If we could have left the area, we would have not succeeded in arresting the accused,” said the officer.Mukhia denied his role in the house break-in and said had fled Mumbai because he feared that he would be blamed for the theft.However, the police kept questioning him and when he was promised that they would let him go if he returned the stolen booty, Mukhia accepted his crime.The cops recovered all the valuables from him and also arrested his uncle Phulo, sister Reena and cousin Bacchan. The police said Mukhia had buried the stolen booty near his house.The police said Mukhia had criminal record against him and had carried out similar thefts at his previous employers’ house after working there for some time.“His whole family has record of carrying out thefts after getting employed as house help. People should check the criminal record of workers before employing them as house helps,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/man-who-helped-mumbai-cops-solve-break-in-case-held-for-1-8-crore-theft-101627932448404.html
03-08-2021||Lucknow||Work in full swing, Bundelkhand villagers in Uttar Pradesh to get piped water in December||The residents of Budhpura village, 30 kilometres south of Jhansi in the drought-prone Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh, are eagerly waiting for the supply of piped drinking water to their households. The construction of a water treatment plant, overhead tank and intake well is in full swing in the village under the Har Ghar Nal Ka Jal (piped water for every household) scheme for the supply of piped drinking water. The residents of Budhpura, as well as 61 other villages, will get piped drinking water with the launch of the scheme in Budhpura village cluster in December, said BK Latoria, consultant engineer (drinking water project). The supply was earlier scheduled to begin in December 2022, he added. But the state government has directed the construction agency to expedite the construction work in Jhansi district to start supply to 648 villages in December this year, he said. The 10 village clusters to be covered by the scheme in Jhansi district include Gulara, Bacheli, Tilaitha, Budhpura, Imlouta, Barthari, Teharka, Kurechha, Purva and Barwar. They will receive water from Matateela, Parichha, Lahchura, Saprar and Pahadi dams, the Barwar lake and the Betwa river, he said. Kundan Ahirwar, a villager, said people living on the rocky terrain of the district were dependent on hand pumps for drinking water. With hand pumps running dry in summer, the villagers had to trudge to water tanks nearby or were dependent on water tankers sent by the district administration. “The supply of pure drinking water to households has remained a dream for us. The villagers are hopeful that with the launch of the Har Ghar Nal Ka Jal project, they will get the required drinking water with ease. It will protect us from toil and water-borne diseases. The villagers will save time which can be utilised on other works to increase income,” he said. Principal secretary (Namami Gange) Anurag Srivastava said the state government was going to start the supply of drinking water to thousands of homes in the Bundelkhand and Vindhyan regions from December. The state government has completed about 80% work of water treatment plants in various districts of Bundelkhand, including Jhansi and Mahoba. The Har Ghar Nal Ka Jal Yojana launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is aimed to be completed within six months, much before the earlier schedule announced by the state government, he said. “It will be a New Year’s gift to the villagers of Bundelkhand and Vindhyan region by the state government. The supply of pure water will bring relief to the people from diseases and the villages will be rid of the recurrent water crisis,” he said. Under the Jal Jeevan Mission, 467 piped drinking water schemes are being constructed as part of 32 projects launched by the state government. While 43 schemes are surface water-based, 424 are ground water-based. With the launch of the scheme, water connections will be provided to 1,195,265 households having a population of 7,2 68,705 in 3,823 revenue villages. The project will benefit the people residing in 40 tehsils, 68 development blocks, and 2608 gram panchayats of seven districts — Jhansi, Mahoba, Lalitpur, Jalaun, Chitrakoot, Banda and Hamirpur of the Bundelkhand region, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/work-in-full-swing-bundelkhand-villagers-in-uttar-pradesh-to-get-piped-water-in-december-101627932209247.html
03-08-2021||Mumbai||Party fights Sena Bhavan row with Marathi manoos card||The sparring between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiv Sena leaders in Maharashtra has given fuel to the Uddhav Thackeray-led party to activate its cadre and strike an emotional chord with its core constituents – the middle-class Marathi population of Mumbai – ahead of the crucial Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections. The Shiv Sena has picked up the Marathi ‘manoos’ card to counter the BJP after one of its legislators Prasad Lad said they will demolish Shiv Sena Bhavan, party headquarters in Central Mumbai, if the time comes. Speaking at a government event on Sunday, chief minister and Sena president Uddhav Thackeray said, “Nobody should speak the language of slapping us. Because we will give back more than what we get. We have been doing that (hitting back) and will continue to do so. We will give such a tight slap that the other person will not get back on his feet.” Senior Sena leader and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut rejected Lad’s clarification that he expressed regret over the statement and said that such mistakes cannot be forgotten by the people of Maharashtra. “No political party in Maharashtra or their leaders, who understand the importance of pride of Marathi people, will make such statements. Marathi people have not liked the language that was used against Shiv Sena Bhavan and no political party, of any ideology, has supported this... It is fine that [he has] expressed regret, but such mistakes cannot be forgiven. Maharashtra and its people will keep this in their minds,” Raut said. “They (BJP) are training the gun against us using these [outsiders], but the BJP will have to pay a hefty price because of such people.” Lad was in the NCP before he joined the BJP. He is now considered a close aide of opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis. Raut said that Shiv Sena Bhavan was not just any other building but it holds the same reverence like Hutatma Chowk. “We dare them to come and attack; they will come on their feet but go with the support of [other’s] shoulder,” he said. Political analyst pointed out that since Thackeray became the chief minister, there was some disconnect between the cadre and the top leadership. But such instances and aggressive statements from party boss have revived the “militant” nature of the party ahead of the civic polls. Surendra Jondhale, political analyst, said, “The Shiv Sena has tried to revive its aggressive posture for the forthcoming BMC elections. They are trying to show that the Sena militancy has not eroded. Uddhav’s statement during the BDD chawl programme about Marathi manoos was significant, which was backed by NCP chief Sharad Pawar in a way. Uddhav implicitly gave green signal to the cadre and leaders to talk about Marathi manoos. Uddhav’s attack on the BJP has sent message to common Shiv Sainik and they will get encouraged,” said Jondhale, former professor of political science at Mumbai University. As the battle for Mumbai’s civic body draws near, the friction between the former allies – BJP and Sena – is expected to grow more. The BMC is controlled by the Shiv Sena for three decades now. Following the bitter breakup between the Sena and the BJP in November 2019, the BJP now intends to wrest control of the richest civic body to give a jolt to the Sena. The BJP and Sena contested the previous BMC elections independently and the former convincingly demonstrated that they are a force to reckon with, as it secured 82 seats in the 227-member BMC – a jump from 31 seats in 2012. The Sena has used similar tactics ahead of the 2012 BMC elections when then chief minister Prithviraj Chavan had made a statement that the Congress will reduce the Sena to irrelevance in state politics. The Sena then had built a narrative of who would care about the welfare of Marathi people if the Congress comes to rule the civic body. Political analysts added that the upcoming civic election is a contest between the BJP and Shiv Sena. While BJP had won a chunk of seats in the wards from western suburbs, it can further consolidate to get more seats. The Sena is now moving towards its core ideology – Marathi manoos – to secure the voter base. This move will help the Sena counter the threat from Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), analysts said. “The BJP is uncomfortable with this agenda, it will take refuge in Hindutva as their core constituency is Marwaris, Jains, Gujaratis and north Indians,” Jondhale said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/party-fights-sena-bhavan-row-with-marathi-manoos-card-101627932208000.html
03-08-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC reserves order on Raj Kundra’s plea against arrest in porn film case||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday concluded the hearing of the petition filed by businessman and actor Shilpa Shetty’s husband Raj Kundra and his associate Ryan Thorpe wherein they alleged that the Mumbai Police had arrested them illegally. While Kundra claimed the police did not serve him notices as mandated under the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), the counsel for Thorpe submitted that he was arrested despite cooperating with investigators. The counsel for the police, however, submitted that as both Kundra and Thorpe had been found deleting evidence, the police could not be mute spectators, and hence to prevent further destruction of evidence the duo were arrested. The court was also informed that though Kundra was a British citizen he had secured an Aadhaar card and was conducting his activities. The single judge bench of justice AS Gadkari, while hearing Kundra’s plea, was informed by senior advocate Aabad Ponda that though Kundra was not named in the first information report (FIR), the police searched his office and asked him to be present at the crime branch’s office at Byculla. However, when he went there, he was arrested without being served a notice which is in violation of laws safeguarding a person from arrest when the offence carries less than seven years of imprisonment.Chief public prosecutor Aruna Pai submitted that the arrest was not illegal as the police found both Kundra and Thorpe deleting WhatsApp chats and other information that can serve as incriminating evidence against the duo. She said the police had recovered 68 pornographic movies along with material from personal laptops, cell phones apart from the 51 videos found on Storage Area Network (SAN). Pai added that a PowerPoint presentation with details of the working and marketing strategy of Hotshots app were also recovered during the search at Kundra’s office. She also refuted the claims of illegal arrest and said that both had been served notices, but only Thorpe had accepted it. While claiming that section 201 (punishment for causing disappearance of evidence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was added by the police as an afterthought when the petition was filed, Ponda said, “There is no contemporaneous record to show deletion, rather there are contemporaneous records to say non-deletion of data by accused. This is thus an afterthought and has been made to meet the requirement to tackle this petition.”Ponda added that if the police had found Kundra deleting data, they should have mentioned it in the panchnama or first remand, but it was not the case. He said there was no material to show that Kundra deleted the data on the night of his arrest on July 19. He further said the police had acted with vendetta as Kundra had refused to acknowledge its notice under section 41A of CrPC. Advocate Abhinav Chandrachud, for Thorpe, concurred with Ponda’s arguments and said while his client had acknowledged the police notice, he was not given an opportunity to comply with the same, and therefore his arrest was illegal. He added there were doubts regarding the investigation as there were discrepancies as to the date of deletion of the videos in question as well. The court then concluded the hearing and reserved its orders, which will be pronounced in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-reserves-order-on-raj-kundra-s-plea-against-arrest-in-porn-film-case-101627931967904.html
03-08-2021||Chandigarh||HIV+ blood transfusion: VB questions 2 suspects||The state Vigilance Bureau (VB) on Monday examined two sacked medical laboratory technicians (MLTs), suspects in the HIV+ blood transfusion case at a government hospital in Bathinda.HT had on Saturday reported that the VB had failed to question suspects even after seven months. The Bathinda range unit of the bureau questioned the suspects for the first time after the matter was handed over to it eight months ago.VB’s deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Kuldeep Singh said Gurpreet Singh Godara and Gurpreet Singh Ghumman were directed to appear at the bureau office for questioning.“Details cannot be divulged at this juncture. We will also question accused Jagdeep Singh and Ajay Sharma. More people from the Bathinda district hospital and others may be asked to join the investigation,” he said.In December last year, the state health department had tasked the VB’s Bathinda unit to investigate possibilities of a nexus of the sacked hospital staff and others behind the repeated cases of wrong blood transfusion at the government-run blood bank at Bhai Shaheed Bhai Mani Civil Hospital.The step was taken after five persons, including four thalassaemia patients aged between 7 and 13, being treated at the district hospital were found HIV positive after blood transfusion.The role of at least six staffers then posted at the blood bank came under the scanner in breach of strict guidelines of blood transfusion.As the Bathinda district police are conducting a regular criminal investigation in which the main accused, Baldev Singh Romana, a medical laboratory technician was already arrested, the VB was asked to probe patterns where several were infused infected blood at the same place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hiv-blood-transfusion-vb-questions-2-suspects-101627931788206.html
03-08-2021||Mumbai||Western Maharashtra likely to get above normal rains in August, September||The India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) probabilistic rainfall forecast for the remaining monsoon period shows a high chance of above normal rains in western Maharashtra. IMD’s forecast, released on Monday, also indicates that chances of above normal rainfall are higher in September.The standalone forecast for August shows that above normal rainfall is most likely (35 to 45% probability) across a majority of the area along the coastline and Western Ghats. In addition, a combined forecast for August and September indicates a very high probability (greater than 75%) of witnessing above normal rainfall across these regions.DS Pai, head of climate and research services at IMD Pune, concurred and advised authorities concerned to pay close attention to IMD’s short-range weather forecasts. “The first week of August will be quite dry, but the intensity of rains will pick up after August 7 and lead to a wet spell toward month-end. Even though the intensity of rains tapers off after July, there is still above normal rainfall in only about two weeks. So, officials should be ready in case a large quantity of rain is deposited in a matter of days or hours,” Pai said.Forecasts issued by other meteorological centres, such as the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the USA’s National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) also suggest that the monsoon in western Maharashtra will be more active in the second fortnight of August than the first.Experts and officials warned that the ongoing subdued rainfall phase should be used to prepare for the possibility of heavy rainfall events in Konkan and surrounding regions for the remaining duration of monsoon, even though August showers are typically less intense than those seen last month. The broad action points raised include planning discharge of water from dams, ramping up relief and rehabilitation work and shifting people from landslide-prone areas. Adequate preparation will also involve ensuring that all automatic weather stations, rain gauges and doppler radars are working efficiently in addition to strengthening communications systems.“In light of this forecast, authorities concerned must carefully plan the discharge of water from various dams in Konkan and western Maharashtra. Furthermore, a mapping of landslide-prone areas is crucial along with relocation of people from such areas,” said Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, UK. “My concern is that vulnerable mountains may have become more vulnerable. So you may not need that much rainfall now to trigger landslides. Such areas need to be immediately identified with the help of an expert committee of geologists. Furthermore, some rivers are still in spate, so the safety of people living near floodplains needs to be considered. Lastly, a strategic deployment of disaster response teams needs to be done now to improve disaster response time during the anticipated heavy rainfall events,” he added.Experts also emphasised that authorities should expedite relief measures which are yet to be provided to persons already affected by last month’s floods, so that a backlog is not created in the event of another flood situation. “Another focus needs to be on cleaning up drainage channels and creeks which may currently be filled with silt after the floods. This will become harder to do once the rains begin,” said Pai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/western-maharashtra-likely-to-get-above-normal-rains-in-august-september-101627931728227.html

03-08-2021||Chandigarh||Farm laws: SAD-BSP MPs give wheat stalks to parliamentarians||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MPs on Monday handed over wheat stalks to parliamentarians to highlight the plight of farmers protesting on the Delhi borders, and demanded justice for them. Former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, who was leading the protest, offered wheat stalks NDA government ministers and MPs and asked them to introspect about the treatment being meted to the farmers. Speaking to the media, Harsimrat said: “if we are partaking our daily bread, we have only farmers to thank. It is shocking that a community to which everyone is beholden is being persecuted by the Union government which refuses to repeal the three black agriculture laws. Today, we distributed wheat stalks to MPs to appeal to the conscience of our policy makers to be just to the hand that feeds them.” The MPs also raised slogans “Kala kanoon vapis lo and kisano ki mange poori karo,” (withdrawn lack laws, accept demands of the farmers). Harsimrat said the SAD-BSP parliamentarians had been demanding a discussion on the need for repeal three farm laws since the first day of the monsoon session. “We moved repeated adjournment motions. But all were disallowed,” she added. She condemned the attempts being made by the Centre to not only defame the farmers’ protest but also belittle the sacrifices made by them for this noble cause.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farm-laws-sad-bsp-mps-give-wheat-stalks-to-parliamentarians-101627931489097.html
03-08-2021||Mumbai||Monsoon ailments on rise in Mumbai amid heavy downpour||Amid the heavy downpour, Mumbai is grappling with monsoon-related ailments, especially malaria. There has been almost 56% rise in cases of malaria in July compared to the previous month, as per data provided by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The civic body has warned citizens against self-medication as they may confuse Covid-19 with seasonal ailments due to similar symptoms. There were 357 malaria cases in June which increased to 557 the next month (till July 25). Similarly, 19 cases of dengue were reported in July in the same time period as opposed to 12 in June. Cases of swine flu have doubled as the number of cases rose from six in June to 18 in July. Civic officials claimed that due to the heavy rainfall last month, incidences of mosquito-borne ailments increased. They added that more people are approaching doctors timely as a result of rise in awareness. “Every monsoon, we witness a surge in cases like malaria and dengue. Last year, cases were less due to the lockdown. This year, the movement of people outside is more, so cases have increased. But we are also investigating the reason behind the rise in cases,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC.Civic-run major hospitals are witnessing a sudden rise in the footfall of patients related to monsoon ailments. They are being referred to the fever clinics that started last year for diagnosis of Covid-19. Between July 25 and 31, BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central recorded 1,091 patients at their fever Outpatient Department (OPD) clinic. Of this, four were diagnosed with malaria, nine were admitted for dengue and five patients tested positive for leptospirosis. “Along with malaria and dengue, the incidence of leptospirosis has also increased. This can be attributed to the heavy rain recorded last week,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of the hospital.Considering that Covid-19 has symptoms similar to monsoon-related ailments, all hospitals are conducting RT-PCR tests among patients with symptoms such as fever, cough, respiratory tract infections to overrule the possibility of misdiagnosis.“We need to look at other specific symptoms to make a diagnosis. So if a patient has mostly upper respiratory symptoms like runny nose and sore throat, flu is more likely. Joint pains and swelling suggest chikungunya; loss of taste, smell or breathlessness suggest Covid. Blood tests help in making a diagnosis when clinical features do not help,” Dr Shalini Suralkar, consultant physician at LH Hiranandani Hospital, Powai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/monsoon-ailments-on-rise-in-mumbai-amid-heavy-downpour-101627931488037.html

The time restrictions have attracted criticism from the industry body, calling it a “shock” for the industry. Pradeep Shetty, sr. vice president, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), said that most of Maharashtra’s neighbouring states have lifted restrictions and allowed economic activities. He said that in the first wave, the industry was shut for 11 months and in the second wave of infections, it was shut for four months. “This evening’s communication from the government for the restaurant industry has come as a shock to us. There is no reason for imposing restrictions on restaurant timings and if it going to continue with the restrictions, then the least the government needs to do is waive the applicable statutory charges for restaurants. “Most of Maharashtra’s neighbouring states have eased the lockdowns. Gujarat allows commerce to remain open till 10 pm and has permitted social gatherings of up to 400 people and has also offered financial relief to businesses. Kerala, too, has announced industry-specific relief, is not collecting the statutory levies from its businesses apart from several relief measures to support its hospitality industry. Here, we neither have the permission to conduct business nor are we being compensated. We need a clear roadmap about what is to be expected from the government for us to accordingly make informed decisions for our businesses,” Shetty said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-relaxations-all-shops-in-mumbai-can-stay-open-till-10pm-101627931250812.html

He said it was time to take a few stringent decisions to avoid natural calamities like the ones witnessed in Western Maharashtra and Konkan last week.The CM visited flood-hit Sangli and Kolhapur on Monday and took stock of damages. He said the state is studying all the reports submitted by expert groups on ecology, flooding as well as recommendations for correctional steps. He said that besides rehabilitation of villages that are vulnerable to flooding and events like landslides, there needs to be a change in policies related to development works. He added that illegal constructions and encroachments in floodplains and riverbanks need to be removed. He added that the government is also tapping the idea of diverting flood water to drought-affected areas.“It is true that the reports submitted by Vadnere and other committees have been gathering dust, but I have asked the administration to revisit them and come up with a comprehensive plan to take steps to avoid any such calamity in the future. If it is not done now, it will be too late. We are constituting a committee to recommend the steps to be taken to save eco-sensitive zones and also for flood management. It is high time to chalk out a policy for development works in eco-sensitive areas. After all, there is limit to the capacity of nature’s tolerance. Development is important, but at the same time protection of ecology is more important. If the need be, we will also change development plans designed for the districts as per the changed situation,” he said.Thackeray urged the people in the respective districts to cooperate with the authorities in implementing stricter policies in the wake of the floods that caused damages in Sangli, Kolhapur, Satara, Ratnagiri, Raigad and Sindhudurg. As many as 219 people died in flooding and landslide and six are still missing, while 52 have been injured in rain-related incidents since July 22.The CM said, “The frequency of these natural calamities has shrunk, and they have become severe. Seasonal rainfall is recorded in just a few days, leading to the devastating effect”. He said the state has requested the Centre for change in the National Disaster Response Fund allotment to increase the financial aid for the people affected by natural calamity. Thackeray said he has written a letter to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman requesting her to direct the bank and insurance companies to be lenient while settling claims against the losses and giving loans to the affected people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/landslide-in-sahyadri-cm-uddhav-thackeray-hints-at-curbs-on-construction-activities-101627931188945.html

The Sangat is deeply hurt,” she said, accusing Sidhu of repeatedly violating the maryada. “Sidhu should arrive at the Gurdwara Sahib as a devotee and forbid his party workers from indulging in actions that are against Sikh principles,” she added. On the insult to the Kakars (articles of Sikh faith) in Kurukshetra, she alleged that the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) had orchestrated the conspiracy. “Such people create an atmosphere of conflict, while governments are silent.

The move came as Sena workers were irked with the company’s move to erect signage a with only their branding whereas the airport is named Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA), after the Maratha warrior king.Adani Airports Holding Limited (AAHL) said they have replaced the previous branding with Adani Airports which is in compliance with the norms and guidelines of the Airport Authority of India (AAI). “In light of the incidents around Adani Airport branding at the Mumbai International Airport, we firmly assure that AAHL has merely replaced the previous branding with Adani Airport branding and that no change has been made to CSMIA’s branding or positioning at the terminal. The branding at CSMIA is in compliance with the norms and guidelines of AAI. AAHL will continue to adhere to all the guidelines laid out by the government in the interest of the aviation community at large,” AAHL said in a statement issued on Monday.A group of BKS members led by BKS secretary Sanjay Kadam reached the Mumbai international airport vicinity and vandalised the neon signboard with branding of Adani, which recently took over the operations of Mumbai airport from GVK group.Kadam said the party had fought for the airport to be named after Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. “We will not object if it reads Chhatrapati Shivaji Airport operated by Adani instead of Adani Airport. The change should be made at every location in the vicinity,” he said.Sena chief spokesperson and BKS president Arvind Sawant congratulated BKS members who vandalised the signboard and said this was a spontaneous reaction. “It was a spontaneous reaction, as putting board of Adani Airport is an insult to Shivaji Maharaj and Marathi manoos,” he said. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), too, said that any change in the name of the airport is not acceptable and the Adani Group must ensure that the sentiments of the people are not hurt. Party national spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik said, “Adani Group took over the airport and the property, but it does not mean they have the right to change its name. The state and the Central government jointly approved its name as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport. If it is being changed to Adani Airport then they are playing with the sentiments of the people, which is the reason that the incident took place. Adani Group should avoid taking any step which will hurt people’s sentiments.”“Violence in any form cannot be supported but such a situation arises if sentiments are hurt, be it Adani or someone else. We are hopeful that Adani Group will be cautious in this matter,” he added.This is the second controversy in the past two weeks since Adani took over CSMIA. Earlier on July 20, the ruling parties — Shiv Sena and Congress — criticised Adani Group’s rumoured decision to move Mumbai airport’s headquarters from the city to Ahmedabad in Gujarat. The move was also termed an attempt to reduce the importance of Mumbai. Later, Adani Group denied shifting the headquarters and called it a “rumour”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-workers-vandalise-adani-airport-signboard-in-mumbai-101627930587904.html

I discuss complexity limitations inherent to autonomic behavior but also to integration in complex cyber-physical and human environments,” added Prof Joseph in his virtual address.The AICTE approved FDP was formally inaugurated by Prof P Nagabhushan, director of IIIT-A, who addressed the participants while highlighting the significance of cyber security in today’s world. Prof Nagabhushan also encouraged the participants for high quality research in the related areas of cyber security.Prof Vijayshri Tewari, registrar and prof Pawan Chakraborty, head of the IT department also addressed the participants.

Instead they owe ₹6,500 crore to the government, which they took in the form of a loan,” said AAP MLA and the party’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj during a press conference on Monday.Bhardwaj alleged that on one hand, the cash-strapped civic bodies say that they don’t have enough money to pay salaries to their employees but, on the other hand, they have money to pay their councillors. “The north corporation alone owes ₹2,407 crore to the Delhi government; yet it has decided to give ₹50 lakh to its councillors... The municipal corporations do not pay salaries... so that the employees go on strikes and they (civic body) can extort money from the Delhi government,” he said.Repeated calls and messages to the mayor of north corporation seeking comment went unanswered.Refuting the allegations, mayor of east Delhi municipal corporation Shyam Sundar Agrawal said the Delhi government was lying, adding that it owes the three civic bodies a total of ₹1,300 crore under the Fourth Delhi Finance Commission.“The AAP leaders should sit across the table and debate with us over how much money they owe to the civic bodies, which have been struggling to pay their employees as well as carry out development works. They owe us funds that need to be released under the Fourth Delhi Finance Commission. Even the Delhi high court has asked the Delhi government to release funds due to the corporations,” said Agrawal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-civic-bodies-lock-horns-over-payment-of-dues-101627930287254.html

The centres will also need to have separate massage rooms, toilets, changing rooms and bathrooms for men and women.The guidelines explicitly prohibit cross-gender massage. The centres will only be able to employ people above the age of 18 years, who possess a degree/diploma/certificate in physiotherapy, acupressure or occupational therapy. They will also need to obtain police clearance certificates for all employees and undertake police verification of the premises, a government spokesperson said.“Display boards, in both English and Hindi, shall be displayed at appropriate places at the reception containing the following information: i. Site plan of the premises; ii. Number of beds category-wise for males and females; iii. Details of the employees containing their designation and qualification; iv. Helpline numbers for customers i.e. 112 & 181; v. Declaration stating that ‘The spa massage centre is for spa & massage purpose only. If any customer employee/ employer is found involved in sexual activity, then legal action as per the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act and/or any other law will be taken against them. The same can be reported by calling at 112 & 181’,” the new guidelines said.The centres will also have to mandatorily install CCTV cameras with recording facilities at the entrance, reception and common areas and the camera recording retained for at least three months.“An internal complaints committee under the Prevention of Sexual Harassment of Women at Work Place Act shall be established in the centre where more than 10 employees are working. The existence of such a committee should be displayed at a prominent location. Reports as per law should be sent to the authorities concerned… In case of any violation of the guidelines, penal action shall be taken as per the applicable laws of the local body concerned… Engaging in any form of sexual activity on the premises of the spa centre is totally prohibited,” it further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-sets-guidelines-for-spas-and-massage-centres-to-prevent-sexual-abuse-and-trafficking-101627930167307.html

The car then hit another scooter in which a couple was coming from Ashok Vihar as the traffic signal on their side was green. The two fell off the scooter and sustained serious injuries,” said a police officer, quoting the complaint of the food delivery agent.Police said that the car also hit another scooter and injured two persons, including a woman, who was riding it.Passersby and locals gathered at the accident spot and rushed the five to nearby hospitals.The 56-year-old woman, later identified as Sukhbir Kaur, was admitted to a private hospital, where she was declared brought dead. Her husband, Surender Singh, and another injured man, Ravinder Singh, were referred to Sushruta Trauma Centre. Surender was declared brought dead, police said, adding that Ravinder’s condition is serious.The other two injured persons — identified as Prabmit and a woman named Pushpendra, both from Rani Bagh — were admitted to a hospital in Punjabi Bagh from where they were discharged after treatment.“The complainant gave the offending car’s registration number that helped us establish its ownership. Raids are on to nab the person who was driving it at the time of the accident,” said a police officer associated with the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/elderly-couple-killed-three-others-injured-in-hitandrun-101627930109781.html

A micro-plan has been prepared at the school-level to ensure compliance with Covid-19 norms. Students were allowed to enter only after thermal scanning and hand sanitisation.Entry and exit from classes have been staggered to prevent crowding and only one student will be seated on each desk.Classes having a large strength have been divided into groups and teaching will be held in separate rooms.Wearing mask is mandatory for students, teachers and non-teaching staff.Anish Banyal, principal of Government Senior Secondary School (Boys), Dharamshala, said there was enthusiasm among students as schools have opened after long.He said the school management has arranged thermal scanners and hand sanitisers for the entry points.The classes are being held in compliance with laid down SOPs, he said.Banyal said as per the micro-plan they have prepared, students of different streams will stay in their respective wings even during the recess period.He said attendance will not be enforced and online teaching will also continue.Schools in Himachal were closed in April after Covid-19 cases started to rise.The second wave also led to cancellation of annual exams and students were promoted to the next class.Schools in Chamba will open on Tuesday due to holiday on account of Minjar fair while in Lahaul-Spiti, it will reopen on August 10.Coaching centres, tuitions and training institutes had opened in the state on July 26 while the academic session in colleges would start on August 16.Meanwhile, the sudden spike in daily Covid cases and rising number of active cases has again set alarm bells ringing. The daily cases have doubled from 50-60 cases to 150 in the last week while active cases rose to 1,229 from 600.Himachal education minister Govind Singh Thakur paid a surprise visit to Senior Secondary Government School, Lal Pani, Shimla, on Monday to inspect the Covid-19 protocol.

Since the man drowned while allegedly trying to take a selfie, the department has also decided to station a boat, a diver and life jackets at such vulnerable spots in the city.These are some of the solutions that the department is going to implement short and long-term measures at seven of the city’s perennial waterlogging spots. PWD, which manages most of the arterial roads in the city, has identified seven most vulnerable points where waterlogging has been a chronic problem. They are Minto Bridge, Pul Prahladpur underpass, under Zakhira flyover, Loni Road roundabout, Jahangirpuri Metro station, Karala-Kanjhawala road and IP Estate (Ring Road, opposite WHO building).The PWD officials said waterlogging has been a problem particularly this year because the city has been witnessing record rains, coming in short but heavy bursts. “Delhi witnessed unprecedented showers this year with the cumulative 506mm rainfall in July,” said a senior official.Elaborating on how the measures were being implemented, the officials cited the example of Minto Bridge. Every year, a DTC bus submerged under a waterlogged Minto Bridge. However, the situation has so far been avoided this year.To address the problem, an independent drain along Minto Road towards JLN Marg was laid in April this year as a trial measure to prevent the waterlogging at Minto Bridge. Now, after the success of the measure, the department has decided to widen the drain after monsoon. Officials said that the drain was implemented initially as a short-term measure. CCTVs have also been installed at the bridge, officials said.They said in the long run provisions for an alternate drainage system for the area will be made, and the work is expected to be completed by 2022.“We have made a lot of interventions to ensure no waterlogging takes place at Minto Bridge and we have been successful in doing that. This monsoon is perhaps the first time in past several decades, when no waterlogging has been reported from there. Considering how successful this model has been,, we will try and implement the same at other vulnerable points,” said Dilraj Kaur, PWD secretary.After Minto Bridge, the Pul Prahladpur underpass is the second most dangerous spot, where the discharge of big catchment area flows into a bowl-shaped underpass and leads to flooding. Seven CCTV cameras have been installed there.A third official said as an interim solution, the pumping capacity has been enhanced from 450 horsepower (HP) to 500 HP and seven temporary pumps, with a combined capacity of more than 400 HP, have been installed. As a permanent solution, an additional underground sump with enhanced pumping capacity will be provided.With rainwater flowing down from a nearby railway track, the area under Zakhira flyover and Anand Parbat industrial area also witness waterlogging. The floating material from slum clusters adjacent to the railway track also add to the problem. The permanent solution for this has been suggested as removal of the local shanties by the northern railway, said officials.There is a proposal for laying a pipeline direct up to the existing drain’s end to enhance the capacity of electric pumps at the Loni Road underpass.At the Karala-Kanjhawala road, officials have proposed the construction and remodelling of drain with sump well and pumping system. At I.P. Estate, Ring Road opposite the WHO Building, the permanent solution will be constructing a sump having a capacity of approximately 1.5 lac litres with pumps of suitable discharge, before monsoon sets in next year, said officials.Officials said that they have addressed at least 20 and as many as 37 complaints in barely 30 minutes. They said they have advised all their staffers to be ready as soon as they receive calls to ensure the situation at any particular spot in the city is under brought under control at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pwd-finds-waterlogging-fix-for-7-seasonal-trouble-spots-in-delhi-101627930050700.html

This is the second time that the building has been sealed over the past three months, as Makkar had applied under the residential category for the Matta Wala Vehra on the Akalsar road.According to the building byelaws, more than two floors cannot be constructed in this area. Besides, the construction of projection and 100% covered area of the basement is against the Punjab Municipal Council Act, 1976. He, however, went to make a commercial complex in violation of several rules and regulations. No other action has been taken against him. A notice was also issued to the councillor five months ago. HT has a copy of this notice. “You had submitted the residential plan of a building constructed at Matta Wala Vehra, but the plan was not approved as you have constructed a commercial building at the site. A notice has also been issued...for starting construction in opposition to the proposed plan. The basement, ground floor, first floor, second floor and third floor of a commercial building were constructed at the site and all floors were covered 100%. This is a violation of the byelaws.”An official of the department, pleading anonymity, said, “Such blatant violation cannot be condoned or regularised in any manner or under any policy.”Right to Information activist Suresh Sood said, “Under the PMC Act, the corporation has to demolish the building for such grave violations and the councillor must be removed from the civic body.” Makkar said, “The corporation has done its work by sealing the building.

03-08-2021||Delhi||Supreme Court stays green tribunal order’s ban on functions in Delhi parks||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday stayed an order passed by the National Green Tribunal that imposed a blanket ban on use of parks and open grounds in the Capital for holding public functions, weddings, political rallies and social and political events.A bench of justices Indira Banerjee and V Ramasubramanian passed the order while dealing with a clutch of petitions filed by the various municipal bodies in the capital that stopped taking bookings for events following the ban imposed by NGT in February this year.Appearing for the North and South Delhi Municipal Corporations, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta informed the court that the NGT order had to be stayed as it was in violation of a 2009 order passed by the Supreme Court in MC Mehta case which permits use of parks and open spaces in Delhi for not more than 10 days in a month.In its judgment, the apex court expressed concern over large number of parks in the city being used for construction of marriage pandals and hosting other functions. The court observed that the permitted use of the parks being recreation under the Master Plan, it cannot be permitted for any other use. At the same time, keeping in view the need of the society, the 2009 decision held, “The use of parks by the MCD, the NDMC and the DDA for the purposes mentioned above shall not be permitted more than 10 days in a month. In other words when any of the designated parks is used for such purpose 10 days in a month, no function thereafter shall be permitted during the remaining 20/21 days.”Taking note of this judgment, the SC bench headed by justice Indira Banerjee allowed the appeals of the civic bodies and said that the order passed by the top court in MC Mehta case will hold the field.The order of NGT had come on a plea filed by several resident welfare associations who complained that civic authorities were flouting environmental norms by permitting commercial functions and events in parks and open spaces.Following the NGT order, the civic bodies were left cash starved. Even the Ramlila Ground, which has witnessed several social and political events in the past, was covered under the NGT order. There are close to 130 grounds and parks across South, East and North Delhi Municipal Corporations where events are allowed to take place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sc-stays-green-tribunal-order-s-ban-on-functions-in-delhi-parks-101627930048400.html
03-08-2021||Delhi||Nine-year-old girl raped, murdered by a priest and 3 others in Delhi||A nine-year-old girl was raped and killed allegedly by a priest and three male employees of a crematorium near Delhi Cantonment in south-west Delhi, who then cremated her body allegedly without her parents’ consent or the police being informed. Police said the four men were arrested after the child’s family alleged foul play and staged a protest along with fellow villagers on Sunday night.Police said the family expressed suspicions that the girl may have been sexually assaulted and murdered, given how her body was cremated in a hurry.According to the police, the suspects allegedly told the girl’s mother that the child was electrocuted to death, and also frightened the family off from informing the police by telling them that the police would register a case and send the body for an autopsy, where doctors will take out her vital organs and sell them, the police said.The four men were booked for murder, rape and criminal intimidation, a case regarding which was registered under Indian Penal Code’s sections 302, 376 and 506, in addition to relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the SC/ST Act.They four men were identified as Radhey Shyam, the 55-year-old priest of the crematorium, and three employees Salim, Laxmi Narayan and Kuldeep, who are all known to the girl’s mother, said deputy commissioner of police (south-west) Ingit Pratap Singh.Police said the girl, who lived with her parents in a rented house in front of the crematorium, went to fetch cold water from the water cooler installed at the crematorium around 5.30pm on Sunday. Half an hour later, the priest and the three men called the girl’s mother to the crematorium and showed her the child’s body.“They told her that the girl was electrocuted to death while having water from the cooler. They showed her the burn marks on her daughter’s wrist and elbow, and said her lips had turned blue. The four men asked the girl’s mother to not inform the police about the death. They told her that the police will register a case and the body will be sent for an autopsy, during which doctors will remove her vital organs and sell them. The four then cremated the body,” said DCP Singh.Police said nearly 200 villagers reached the crematorium on Sunday night and carried out a protest till Monday evening, demanding that the arrested persons be booked on rape and murder charges.“We want the strictest punishment for the priest and the three men. If it was a case of electrocution, why did they (the suspects) not inform the police or send the girl’s body to any hospital for autopsy? What was the urgency to cremate the body and that too late in the evening, when no cremation is allowed at the crematorium after 6pm. Why did they do it without the consent of the girl’s parents? We suspect that this is a case of murder after rape,” said a 45-year-old woman neighbour of the girl’s family.According to the neighbour, the residents came to know about the matter when the girl’s parents raised the alarm and told them that their daughter’s body was cremated without their consent.“Some people in our neighbourhood broke open the crematorium gate and confronted the priest... Police should scan the CCTV cameras installed on the premises to ascertain what exactly happened to the girl,” she said.Initially, the police registered a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, wrongful confinement, and destruction of evidence related to the offence along with common intention under Indian Penal Code’s sections 304, 342, 201 and 34. However, following the protest and the circumstantial evidence, the case was converted into one of rape, murder and criminal intimidation, said a senior police officer, who asked not to be named.Police said the crime scene investigation team and forensic experts have collected evidence from the crematorium for further investigation.Delhi social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam visited the protest site and assured to “provide the necessary support to the victim’s family”. In a tweet, the Aam Aadmi Party said, “Police should conduct fair investigation. If not then Delhi government will carry out a magisterial enquiry.”Delhi Congress president Anil Kumar also condemned the incident and said his party will not allow Delhi “to turn into another Hathras”, referring to the cremation by police of a Dalit woman who was allegedly gang raped and murdered in UP’s Hathras. “This is yet another instance of rising lawlessness in the national capital following the Arvind Kejriwal government’s liberalised excise policy, making easy availability of liquor in every ward,” he said.Anti-rape activist Yogita Bhayana also said on Twitter that she met the girl’s family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/priest-and-three-helpers-of-crematorium-arrested-for-rape-and-murder-of-9-year-old-girl-101627930047250.html
03-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Film critic Rashid Irani passes away at 74||Film critic Rashid Irani, 74, who reviewed new English releases for the Hindustan Times for several years, died following a suspected fall, most likely on July 30. The beloved member of the film fraternity lived alone but visited the Mumbai Press Club almost every day. He had spoken in a recent interview about the difficulty he was facing, managing the isolation and monotony of life in the pandemic. He had moved his computer to the Club, colleagues said on Monday, so that he would be compelled to leave the house more often. When he didn’t turn up there for the third day in a row, friends from the Club informed the police and accompanied them to his Dhobi Talao home on Monday afternoon, where he was found. A former accountant and co-owner of the iconic-but-now-shut Brabourne Irani café at Dhobi Talao, Irani had been a film critic for more than four decades. “Rashid would attend every single English film’s press screening. When you saw him, you knew that everything was right with the world,” said film critic Anupama Chopra. His love affair with cinema began in his teens, when he became captivated by the films of Marilyn Monroe and James Dean, said his close friend, photographer Rafeeq Ellias. “He then started watching Iranian films and Japanese films and Korean films. He watched and loved all kinds of cinema.” Irani had contracted Covid-19 last year and recovered. The Mumbai Press Club was always there for him; after all, he’d been a member for 30 years, said chairman Gurbir Singh. “He was very independent-minded and immensely free spirited. I loved that about him,” Singh added. “As soon as he tested negative, for instance, he headed straight home, ignoring all pleas to stay in hospital longer and recuperate.” Chopra remembered how Irani always seemed to know even the most obscure films. “Because he had seen so much. His only focus was cinema,” she added. “He wasn’t distracted by anything else. I don’t think any of us critics will be able to fill his shoes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-film-critic-rashid-irani-passes-away-at-74-101627929992043.html

From the last four years, there is no elected representative in Jammu and Kashmir. As a result, the UT is lagging behind in development, education, health and other key sectors,” he said before leaving for Delhi on Monday evening.He said L-G Manoj Sinha’s administration cannot be an option to the elected representatives.“There is no MLA or assembly today... the ideal situation in any democracy is to have elected representatives. Bureaucracy is not meant to deal with people directly. Their job is indoor. Outdoor is for elected representatives, which is not the case in J&K for the past three-and-a-half-years,” he added.Azad said in the absence of elected government in J&K, the hardships of people has increased manifold.He reiterated five demands of Congress—expeditiously completing the process of delimitation of assembly constituencies followed by statehood, which he said “can be done in a single day” and then immediately conducting assembly elections.“The two other demands are of safeguarding land and jobs besides dignified return and rehabilitation of Kashmiri Pandits,” he said.He said, “The way forward for all of us is to give statehood before holding elections as it will ensure optimum participation of people. And it will be good for all: Centre, the state and the democracy.”Amid frequent disruptions by the Opposition in Parliament over Pegasus snoopgate, Azad said he wasn’t bothered by it.“I’m not affected by it as this has been going on for seven years now. I raised this (snooping issue) in the Parliament on more than one occasion but the government never said anything on it,” he said.He denied that Congress is a divided house in its backyard. “Every political party has weakness and deficiencies. Who knows what will happen in 2024 but we will strengthen the party. In Punjab, we will form government,” he said.On what changed after the PM’s all-party meeting, he said, “Delimitation panel came into action. It didn’t move out in the last one-and-a-half-year but it did immediately after the meeting. The panel expedited its work, visited J&K and met delegations. We hope statehood will be announced before holding elections,” he added.On the assembly seats between Kashmir and Jammu, Azad refused to draw any inference. He, however, said two things are mandatory while conducting the delimitation exercise — population and topography.“They are two important aspects in such an exercise. I hope the election commission should consider them while conducting the exercise,” he said.“If there is no Darbar Move, Jammu will be ruined. Kashmir will not be impacted but Jammu’s economy will be ruined as many Kashmiris come and take rented accommodations in Jammu,” he said.He referred to Ladakh where he said parties in Kargil and Leh, except the BJP, want statehood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/announce-j-k-statehood-before-holding-polls-ghulam-nabi-azad-101627929990999.html

The portal was launched around 8pm Monday, and, according to the data shared by the university, 8,087 candidates registered within an hour of its launch; the portal also saw a traffic of around 74,000 during that hour, an indication of just how highly sought after seats in Delhi University are. The last date to submit forms is August 31 and the first cutoff is expected in the second week of September. Last year, the first cutoff came out on October 10. Several aspirants were disappointed with the late launching of the portal. Divya Mondal, 18, who plans to apply for a degree in psychology, said, “We knew that the admission process would start today (Monday), but we didn’t know when. My friends and I have been trying since morning, but the link wasn’t working. When we visited college portals, they were asking us for a DU registration link which wasn’t made available till late evening.”Owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, the admission process is completely digital this year as well. Last year, since the admission portal was open for around three months, the university received over 353,000 applications for the 70,000 undergraduate seats— the highest the varsity has received till date.Except for 15 undergraduate courses to which students are admitted based on entrance test results, admissions to all other undergraduate courses in over 63 DU colleges are conducted through a merit-based process— on the basis of cutoff marks. Colleges are supposed to give admission to all applicants who meet the announced cut-off criteria. With around 80% of DU applicants graduating from CBSE-affiliated schools, the cutoffs this year are likely to remain on the higher side. Around 220,000 students scored 90% and above marks in CBSE Class 12 this year, with around 70,000 of them scoring around 95% or more.Last year, DU saw 100% cutoffs in certain courses after a gap of five years. Lady Shri Ram (LSR) College announced 100% marks in best of four subjects for admissions to three courses – political science, psychology, and economicsTo make things easier for applicants, the university has decided to retain last year’s eligibility criteria for various courses. The fee for merit-based and entrance-based admissions, registration, and cancellation will also remain the same. The university has also set up virtual help desks and installed interactive chatbots on the website to assist students and address their queries in real-time.DU will not conduct sports and extracurricular activities (ECA) trials this year due to the prevailing pandemic situation. Admissions to the 5% of supernumerary seats reserved under sports and ECA categories collectively in each course will be conducted on the basis of certificates, as it was done last year as well. However, the university has introduced a small relaxation this time.“Only for this year, the applicants will be allowed to upload certificates of the preceding four years — from May 1, 2017 to April 30, 2021. Students have to choose the best three years’ certificates and upload them,” said Rajeev Gupta, chairperson, admissions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-8-000-register-within-an-hour-of-du-opening-its-admissions-portal-101627929930011.html

All classroom sessions are currently being held online in Delhi. According to officials, the government has so far received over 32,000 responses from stakeholders.“We are reviewing the suggestions from the public, some demanded the reopening (of schools), others didn’t. A decision is to be taken soon based on all factors (vaccines for children, daily case count, etc) and the feedback. Largely, it seems that many people want it (schools’ reopening),” he said while speaking to the media on Monday.Several states, including Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Odisha, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, and Gujarat, have either partially reopened schools or are in the process of doing so this month.The Uttar Pradesh government has announced plans to reopen schools for classes 11 and 12 from August 16.A senior government official, requesting anonymity, said, “The government will review all suggestions. An analysis of the suggestions will be placed before the DDMA (Delhi Disaster Management Authority) in the next meeting. Any decision will be taken after properly analysing the Covid-19 situation.”Meanwhile, the Directorate of Education (DoE) on Monday asked all heads of government schools to ensure that teachers and staff members have received at least one shot of the Covid-19 vaccine.“It must be appreciated that the very idea of reopening schools for children will remain unviable as long as all our teachers do not get vaccinated, at least, once,” the DoE said in a circular. The school principals have been asked to submit a report on the vaccination status of their staff by August 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/most-people-in-favour-of-schools-reopening-in-delhi-says-sisodia-101627929929524.html

03-08-2021||Delhi||'Sushil planned and executed murder as his ego couldn’t tolerate diminishing clout at stadium’: Charge sheet filed||Olympic medallist Sushil Kumar killed a fellow wrestler because his ego was bruised by rumours of his diminishing clout and he wanted to re-establish his authority among younger athletes, alleged the police in a charge sheet submitted to a Delhi court on Monday.Kumar, who won medals at the Beijing and London Olympics, is facing charges of murdering 23-year-old wrestler Sagar Dhankad inside Chhatrasal stadium, the arena that Kumar elevated to an iconic sporting destination and inspired a generation — before his dramatic fall from grace.“Kumar is the kingpin of the murder who hatched a conspiracy to kill Dhankad with the help of the co-accused... Since Kumar was the all-in-all of Chhatrasal stadium, therefore, he chose this place to execute his conspiracy,” said the charge sheet, seen by HT.The 1,495-page document, which named Kumar as the main accused and 12 others as accomplices, was filed before chief metropolitan magistrate (CMM) Satvir Singh Lamba. The charge sheet also said that police psychologists found him unremorseful.The 38-year-old wrestler, who won bronze at Beijing 2008 and silver at London 2012, is currently lodged in solitary confinement inside Tihar’s jail number two on charges of murder, abduction, attempt to murder, criminal conspiracy, culpable homicide and trespass.Kumar has also been booked for robbery, dacoity and dishonestly receiving stolen property. Five suspects are yet to be arrested in the case.FEELING HUMILIATEDThe charge sheet said Kumar and Dhankad had a dispute over a flat in Model Town. Dhankad was living as a tenant since December 2019, and was allegedly not vacating it despite Kumar’s repeated intimations.Though Dhankad vacated the house in March-April this year, Kumar felt humiliated by the tenants. Relations soured further, the document said, after rumours surfaced in Chhatrasal that Kumar, despite being called ‘guru’ by the younger athletes, was scared of them.The charge sheet said Kumar suspected some of his trainees and students were passing information about him to Dhankad — and this enraged him.“He started planning to strike them hard to teach them a lesson and re-establishing his supremacy,” said the document.“When he realised that some of his own students/trainees were passing information about him to Sonu and Dhankad, he felt betrayed and developed deep grudge against Sonu and Sagar for loss of respect in the eyes of his students and further betrayal by them by passing his information,” the charge sheet added.A notorious criminal, Sandeep alias Kala Jathedi ,who was arrested by the police on Saturday, also told the police that Kumar’s ego was hurt when Dhankad and Sonu refused to vacate his flat.Kumar and his associates allegedly assaulted Dhankad and two of his friends, Amit Kumar and Sonu Mahal, on the night of May 4 . Dhankad succumbed to the injuries later.The wrestler was arrested on May 23 after a 19-day run from the law that took him to Haridwar, Rishikesh and Punjab. At the time, the police had also announced a cash reward of ₹1 lakh for any information on him.“He called his associates with firearms etc. from different parts of Delhi as well as from Haryana and abducted victim/injured from different parts of Delhi i.e., from Shalimar Bagh, Delhi and Model Town-III, Delhi and taken them to Chhatrasal Stadium to execute his plan of conspiracy,” the charge sheet said.Kumar’s legal team rubbished the charge sheet.“We have come to know that the charge sheet has been filed in the court. However, we have not been supplied the copy of the same. It was through media that we came to know that Sushil Kumar has been chargesheeted by the investigating agency. We will chalk out the defence strategy only after going through the chargesheet along with statements of the witnesses. We are confident that the said chargesheet will not hold ground in the court of law as Sushil Kumar is not involved in the offence as alleged by the investigating agency,” advocate Pradeep Rana, counsel for Kumar, said.‘NO SIGN OF REMORSE’In the charge sheet, police told the court that Kumar was counselled by senior forensic assistants (psychology) who observed that he would lock his jaw and shoulders indicating he was withholding information about the brawl .The analysis also said that he showed no signs of remorse and behaved in an extremely egocentric manner. He thought that he was above the law and was extremely conceited about his name and reputation, the chargesheet said.The police said Kumar and his associate, Ajay Kumar Sehrawat, hatched a conspiracy to kill Dhankad and Sonu. They called another accused, identified as Kala or Joginder, and asked him to bring more men with arms to Chhatrasal stadium on May 4.Following this, a gang reached the stadium with Amit Kumar, who they had abducted on the way.According to the charge sheet, the victims were beaten for around 30-40 minutes with hockey sticks and baseball bats.“Some of the accused persons were carrying firearms with them and they threatened victims for dire consequences. Meanwhile, the gate of the stadium was also bolted/locked from inside and guards were directed to run away from the spot,” the charge sheet said.The police said Kumar and his associate, Ajay Kumar Sehrawat, hatched a conspiracy to kill Dhankad and Sonu.

03-08-2021||Mumbai||Limited use of simulator irks Spicejet pilots||SpiceJet airline’s simulators are being used in a limited manner for the past four months, which has resulted in many pilots not being able to perform their proficiency checks and hence are not able to fly, said sources. Around 150 pilots are likely to be affected due to the non-availability of simulators. Pilot proficiency check (PPC) is conducted every six months, using a flight simulator to continue flying. Sources say that SpiceJet has grounded a good number of its aircraft on account of non-payment of lease rentals in addition to those planes which have been pulled out of operations due to low travel demand amid the pandemic. Due to this, a good number of its pilots are not getting to fly. The airline in an email to the pilots on Monday has assured them to address the issue soon. A SpiceJet spokesperson, in a statement to the paper, too confirmed the delay in the proficiency checks of some of its Boeing fleet pilots. “As most of you will be aware that our simulator availability has been somewhat limited for the past four months. This has resulted in several of you having lost your PPC currency,” SpiceJet said in an email sent to its pilots Monday morning. “We want to assure you that this situation is temporary and could persist for some more time. In the process we are also fully aware and sensitive to the matter that those pilots with PPC expired are not being paid any compensation under the prevailing salary payment scheme,” the letter stated. The spokesperson said, “The proficiency checks of some Boeing 737 Pilots have been delayed. All Boeing 737 Pilots will undergo their ‘recurrent training and proficiency checks’ as required by regulations as the quantum of flying increases over the coming weeks.” Senior airline sources alleged that SpiceJet has slowed down on proficiency checks for some of its pilots as a large number of its Boeing fleet is also grounded on account of non-payment of lease rentals apart from the general grounding due to low travel demand. Since pilots are not current and are not flying, the airline is not paying them as per their contract, they alleged However, SpiceJet spokesperson said that all pilots including those whose licence is not current (Proficiency Test not done) are also being paid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/limited-use-of-simulator-irks-spicejet-pilots-101627929867880.html

In place of the existing building, SGPC plans to develop an 800-room inn, while keeping the outer appearance intact as per the present structure. A section of Sikh bodies and scholars are opposing this. They claim that the historic inn is a valuable piece of heritage. “The Guru Ram Das Serai requires renovation. It should be used as it is after its renovation. Devotees need history and solace and not a hotel-like feeling in a Serai. The feel of history is priceless,” said Kiranjot Singh, member and former general secretary, SGPC.In a social media post, she added, “The Guru Ram Das Serai can be transformed into a unique piece of heritage. The issue, however, is being unnecessarily politicised.” Another SGPC member and senior said, “History and heritage are the assets of a community and a guide for the future generations. I am sorry to say this, but Sikhs created history but have failed to preserve their heritage. The SGPC should dump the plan to demolish the inn. Reconstruction and restoration of the heritage buildings should not be done without the consent of the sangat.”“We should respect our historic buildings. The SGPC should expand accommodation capacity for the sangat visiting the Golden Temple, but not at the cost of historic buildings. Destruction of historic buildings is not legitimate at any cost. Many modern techniques are available with us to preserve heritage buildings,” he said, adding, “I will meet SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur on this.”“Some people are trying to stop the reconstruction of the inn by saying that it has a connection with the 1984 holocaust. This happening, however, has connection with the entire surroundings of the Sri Harmandar Sahib,” the SGPC president had told a press conference a few days ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dissent-surfaces-in-sgpc-over-of-razing-historic-serai-101627929688016.html

The bill, according to the government, is aimed at smoothening the taxpaying process, strengthening accountability and minimising room for tax evasions.“The Delhi government keeps taking suggestions from traders of Delhi from time to time and makes its policies based on that. The doors of the government are always open to traders and they can provide their suggestions any time,” Sisodia told traders.One of the key features of the GST amendment bill is the removal of the requirement of compulsory filing of audited annual accounts and reconciliation statements of the registered taxpayers, which had earlier made traders dependent on chartered and cost accountants.Further, in case of detention, seizure of goods, etc.,the goods can now be released on the payment of a penalty, as against the earlier practice of having to pay a tax as well as the penalty.GST expert and chartered accountant Rakesh Gupta, who attended the meeting with the deputy chief minister, said, “Lakhs of traders will benefit greatly from the bill, a positive consensus can be noticed among traders,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/traders-welcome-gst-amendment-bill-sisodia-says-delhi-govt-open-to-suggestions-101627929567803.html

The deadlines have been extended on humanitarian grounds,” said a senior DDA official aware of the development.Close to 1,354 flats were put on sale in the DDA housing scheme 2021, which was launched in January, and 10,000 flats were put up for sale in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/deadline-to-pay-deposit-for-dda-flats-extended-101627929087221.html
03-08-2021||Delhi||HC asks Delhi govt to consider opening all weekly markets||The Delhi high court on Monday sought the response of the Delhi government on a plea by the Saptahik Patri Bazar Association, a body of weekly markets, which has challenged the decision of the government to open malls and markets, but not weekly markets.Justice Rekha Palli, while issuing notice to the city government, said street vendors should also take proactive steps to get themselves vaccinated in order to keep the much feared third wave of Covid-19 at bay.The high court asked the Delhi government to consider allowing more weekly markets, while observing that a strata of society makes purchases only from such markets since they could not afford the regular shops, malls and markets.“It is expected that DDMA (Delhi Disaster Management Authority) will consider this aspect in its right perspective. It is also expected that street vendors will also take proactive steps to get vaccinated so that we can avoid the third wave and the NCT of Delhi is not left facing a surge as was faced recently,” the court said in its oral order.Presently, with an eye on preventing an escalation in Covid-19 cases, the Delhi government has allowed weekly markets to open only with 50% vendors and only one market is allowed in each municipal zone.The court went on to clarify that “it was not asking the Delhi government to allow all weekly markets to operate”, while also adding that the authorities should consider the issue and take a decision and ensure that all conditions are in place to check crowding. Delhi government counsel Satyakam told the court that there has been a “sudden” uptick in Covid-19 cases, with Delhi currently reporting about 45-49 cases daily — the city recorded 85 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, according to the state health bulletin. He sought time to seek instructions and inform the court.Advocate Rajat Wadhwa, representing the weekly market association, said restrictions on other activities were relaxed on June 13 and vendors of weekly markets, who belong to the poorest of poor class, are left to suffer.When the court remarked that the opening of these markets will lead to crowding, Wadhwa said if only one weekly market is allowed to be open in a municipal zone, then there will be more crowding because people would rush to that single market to make all their purchases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-asks-delhi-govt-to-consider-opening-all-weekly-markets-101627929027196.html
03-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: 15,355 Class-11 seats on offer in govt schools||After releasing the prospectus for Class 11 admissions, the UT education department has announced that there will be 15,355 seats up for grabs in Chandigarh’s government schools for the 2021-2022 academic session.Last year, 12,815 seats were available for admission in Class 11. The number was increased by 2,540 from last year after the government schools witnessed increased applications; many students from private schools also shifted to government institutions after Class 10.After facing the two Covid waves, it is anticipated that parents with financial troubles will also send their kids to government schools now.This year, there are 3,080 seats available in the sciences streams, 3,900 in commerce, 6,600 in humanities and 1,775 seats of vocational courses are available.Last year, there were 6,420 seats available in the humanities stream, 3,080 for sciences (both medical and non-medical), 1,755 for vocational courses and 1,560 for the commerce stream.While the number of seats for the humanities stream has increased slightly, the number of seats in the commerce stream has more than doubled.Speaking about this, UT director school education (DSE) Rubinderjit Singh Brar said, “We have converted three new schools into senior secondary schools in anticipation of increased admissions. To increase the number of seats in sciences, labs and other facilities have to be built which haven’t started yet. But for adjusting more commerce students, facilities will be adequate.”Admissions to open after Class 10 resultsThe admission process will open up two-three days after the Class 10 results are declared, which is likely in the next few days. Brar assured that adequate time will be given to students to apply before the admission process is concluded.Last year, 14,723 students had applied for seats in Class 11 in the first round of counselling and the number is expected to be higher this year. As much as 15% seats are reserved for scheduled castes, 2% for those with sports quota, 3% for physically challenged, 5% for the children of defence personnel and paramilitary, and 2% for the children/grandchildren of freedom fighters.One seat per class is additionally reserved for Kashmiri migrants; the department has cretaed 10 additional seats in skill courses for Muslim girls at the government senior secondary schools in Sector 45 and Manimajra.Currently, government schools have reopened for physical classes from Class 9 onwards, but attendance isn’t mandatory. Only one child is allowed to sit per bench to maintain social distance. All students have to wear a mask and bring a permission slip signed by their parents to enter the school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/class-11-15-355-seats-of-offer-in-chandigarh-s-govt-schools-101627928790271.html

As the monsoon session has been convened amid the fight against Covid-19, both houses of the state legislature will have to make special arrangements to follow the Covid-19 protocol during the session.“Yes, we are ready for the monsoon session. We will follow the Covid-19 protocol and a meeting of leaders of major opposition parties will be convened soon to seek their cooperation,” said Uttar Pradesh assembly speaker Hriday Narayan Dikshit.Besides carrying out other legislative business, including tabling of bills, the state government is likely to present the first supplementary demand for grants in the monsoon session as chief minister Yogi Adityanath has announced important schemes in recent months. The schemes announced in recent months include the ones approved for the upbringing of children who lost their parents to Covid-19 and also the maintenance of women who lost their husbands during the pandemic and have no other means to sustain them. More announcements may be made in the coming weeks as the elections to the state assembly are due early next year.The state government may also have some important ordinances and bills to be tabled and passed by the state legislature during the monsoon session.The state cabinet recently approved draft bills to set up two separate pilgrimage development boards titled Uttar Pradesh Shri Chitrakoot Dham Teerth Vikas Parishad and Uttar Pradesh Vindhya Dham Teerth Vikas Parishad for conservation of cultural heritage and development of Chitrakoot and the Vindhyavasini region of Mirzapur as pilgrimage centres of international importance.The cabinet also approved the draft of the Uttar Pradesh Repeal Ordinance 2021 and, once promulgated, the state government may move a bill to replace the ordinance.The monsoon session may turn out to be the second last session of the present state assembly, the term of which ends early next year. The state government may also convene the winter session in the coming months to carry out its business before going for the polls.Special arrangements had to be made for the previous sessions of the two houses of state legislature. These include the budget session that concluded on March 4. Special arrangements were made for mandatory Covid-19 tests for all the members and the staff. The members who are over 65 years of age were allowed to attend the session online. The members may, however, be required to get vaccinated this time before they take part in the proceedings of two houses of the state legislature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/monsoon-session-of-uttar-pradesh-legislature-to-begin-on-august-17-101627928787881.html

On Sunday, the administration sent 20 samples to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) for testing, which doubled on Monday to 49 more samples.Since the first Zika virus case was reported from Belasar village of Purandar taluka on Sunday, the health officials and administration have been working on a war footing to detect and test everyone in the village and also everyone from the neighbouring villages that fall within a five-km radius of Belasar. On Monday, over 49 blood smear samples were collected for testing and sent to the NIV. Of these 49, two include those with fever, eight pregnant women, 13 high-risk contacts and 25 migrant workers. A total of 15 teams surveyed 3,430 people in six villages that fall within the 5-km radius. Amar Mande, Block Development Officer of Purandar taluka said, “As of now we have restricted the movement of outsiders into the villages, however, being the sowing season villagers do go to nearby fields for agriculture.

The demand comes ahead of the upcoming assembly elections in five states, including in Uttar Pradesh where caste composition is perceived to play a key role in determining electoral outcome.On Saturday, the JD(U) passed a resolution in support of the caste-based counting of population, a move with potentially wide political ramifications, during its national executive meeting. The Bihar assembly has passed unanimous resolutions, in 2019 and 2020, favouring a census on the caste lines.“Bihar assembly has passed a resolution favouring caste-based census twice, which was supported by the BJP as well. All the party MPs from Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha signed the memorandum and explained all the benefits of caste-based census pointwise to the home minister,” Singh told reporters after the meeting, stressing that it is now up to the central government to take the final decision.According to a person aware of the details, Shah is learnt to have told the delegation that the Centre will discuss the issue.On Sunday, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar said that he will seek an appointment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the issue.Another ally of the BJP, the Republican Party of India, has also demanded a caste-based census.The last caste-based census was conducted in 1931. In 1941, however, the data was collected but not made public.At present, apart from the Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes, the other backward castes are grouped under the OBC category.The Centre has said, as a matter of policy, there will be no enumeration as per caste other than that for SCs and STs for the census.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/caste-census-jd-u-team-meets-shah-nitish-says-will-call-on-pm-101627920749464.html

Later, on Friday, the Supreme Court also took cognisance of the incident and sought a report from the state, even after clarifying it was interested in the high court hearing related to the matter.Dhanbad senior superintendent of police Sanjiv Kumar confirmed the police have submitted the report to the high court but refused to share the details.Additional director general (operations) Sanjay Anand Lathkar told reporters that all possible angles to understand the reason behind the road accident that killed Anand is being investigated.The CCTV footage of the incident casts doubts over the nature of the accident as the auto-rickshaw that killed Anand is seen swerving to the extreme left of the road from the centre before hitting the judge down and fleeing from the spot.The two persons -- Lakhan Verma and Rahul Verma -- riding the allegedly stolen three-wheeler, were arrested a day later, and the vehicle recovered. However, the police are yet to officially disclose the motive of the two persons behind the accident. “Different teams are looking into the incident. They have been given specific leads to work on. We are leaving no possible angle to crack the case,” Lathkar told reporters after a marathon meeting in Dhanbad on Monday.Meanwhile, since the SIT took over the case, around 250 persons were picked up for questioning in connection with the case. The Hemant Soren government on Saturday has recommended a CBI probe in the incident. However, the central investigation agency is yet to begin a probe in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/dhanbad-judge-death-2-accused-sent-to-jail-police-submit-probe-report-101627920687311.html

Youngest of the three siblings, she started playing hockey in Class 5 after seeing girls her age going to play in a ground near her school. Her mother Ram Murti, 53, added it was her daughter’s ‘zidd’ (obstinacy) that brought her this far.“Our family saw tough times; we couldn’t even afford a hockey stick for our daughter. But she was determined and under the guidance of her coach, Baldev, she earned this honour,” said the 27-year-old skipper’s father who drove a horse-cart almost all his life to provide for the family.The proud parents added, “We were clueless about the sport. At a time when girls were not even allowed to step outside their homes, we encouraged her to pursue her dreams. We would urge all parents to treat their daughters the way they would treat their sons.” Another local girl, defender Navjot Kaur, 25, was also inspired by other girls going to a hockey ground near their house and started playing at the age of 10, her father Satnam Singh, a shocker mechanic said. Goalie Savita Punia’s saves did the trick While Gurjit Kaur scored the first and only goal of the match in the second quarter, Sirsa girl Savita Punia remained a solid wall as she saved nine goals in the match. Talking over the phone, 31-year-old Punia’s father, Mahender Singh Punia, who works as a pharmacist at a public health centre in Sirsa, said, “Savita has fulfilled the dream of her late grandfather who got her enrolled in hockey at the age of 14.”“In her early days, Savita used to travel 30 kms from Jodhkan to Sirsa to sharpen her hockey skills. Later, she got a hostel facility and she used to visit home on weekends,” he added.Her mother, Leelavati Punia, said,” My daughter had to carry an extra bag for the goalkeeping kit during her travel on private buses. Many times, the conductors refused to let her travel seeing her two big bags. She complained several times that the conductors used to kick her bag aside,” she added.The others in the team from the state include Navjot Kaur, Neha Goyal, Monika Malik, Navneet Kaur, Nisha, Sharmila Devi and Udita. Nisha’s father Sohrab Mohammad, said they had shifted to Sonepat from Uttar Pradesh’s Moradabad 50 years ago. “I have three daughters and a son. My other two daughters are married. I was a tailor but due to paralysis, I have been unable to work since 2016. My wife Mahrun had started working at a factory but eventually, Nisha got a job in the Indian Railways through sports quota and became the sole breadwinner of the family. For the last many years, she has been waking up at 5 in the morning for practice sessions. I am hoping that the Indian girls will make us proud,” Sohrab added. Haryana sports minister and ex-captain of the Indian men’s hockey team, Sandeep Singh, also congratulated the team for the victory. “Hopefully this time, the Olympic medal will be ours,” he wrote on Twitter. Home minister Anil Vij also spoke to Rani Rampal over the phone to congratulate the team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chak-de-moment-for-families-of-women-hockey-players-from-haryana-101627907486921.html

Other cities quickly organised to join the chant from their homes in the evenings, as a message of support for embattled security forces.Clashes between Afghan forces and the Taliban have intensified across the country with the insurgent group gaining control over check points, trading posts and infrastructure projects.The Taliban said their fighters in Kabul killed a district governor of central Maidan Wardak province on Tuesday, the latest in a series of killings by the insurgent group aimed at eliminating senior government officials and social activists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/powerful-explosion-gunfire-hit-kabul-civilians-protest-against-taliban-101628011189312.html
03-08-2021||World||Boeing postpones Starliner capsule test flight to space due to glitch||Boeing Co on Tuesday postponed the planned launch of its CST-100 Starliner capsule from Florida's Cape Canaveral bound for the International Space Station due to a glitch in what was to have been a crucial do-over test flight following a near-catastrophic failure during its 2019 debut.During pre-launch preparations, Boeing engineers detected "unexpected valve position indications" in its propulsion system, Boeing said in a statement. The problem was detected during checks after electrical storms in the region, Boeing added."We're disappointed with today's outcome and the need to reschedule our Starliner launch," said John Vollmer, the program's manager. "Human spaceflight is a complex, precise and unforgiving endeavor, and Boeing and NASA teams will take the time they need to ensure the safety and integrity of the spacecraft and the achievement of our mission objectives."The Starliner capsule loaded with supplies had been scheduled to have blasted off atop an Atlas V rocket flown by the United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp, at 1:20 p.m. EDT (1720 GMT) from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.The launch had been planned for last Friday, but was postponed by NASA after the space station was briefly thrown out of control with seven crew members aboard, a mishap caused by the inadvertent reignition of jet thrusters on a newly docked Russian service module. Russia's space agency blamed a software glitch.Tuesday's planned uncrewed mission was intended as a precursor to a closely watched crewed flight potentially to be conducted before the end of the year. It was to be a key trial for the U.S. aerospace giant after back-to-back crises - a pandemic that crushed demand for new planes and a safety scandal caused by two fatal 737 MAX crashes - that have damaged Boeing's finances and engineering reputation.Atlas V's dual Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10A-4-2 engines were poised to send Starliner on a 113-mile (98 nautical miles/181 km) suborbital trajectory before the capsule separates and flies under its own power to the space station in a roughly 24-hour overall journey.The Starliner capsule headlined Boeing's efforts against billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX to be the first to return NASA astronauts to the space station from U.S. soil in nearly a decade.But a series of software glitches during the December 2019 debut launch resulted in its failure to dock at the orbital laboratory outpost. SpaceX's Crew Dragon has gone on to launch three crewed space station missions since 2020, with a fourth slated as early as Oct. 31, according to NASA.Boeing has spent a year and a half correcting issues flagged during NASA reviews, part of the U.S. space agency's strategy to ensure access to the sprawling international research satellite some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.NASA in 2014 awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to build their own capsules that could fly American astronauts to the space station in an effort to wean the United States off its dependence on Russia's Soyuz vehicles for rides to space following the end of NASA's space shuttle program in 2011. If all goes well, Boeing will bring the capsule home on Aug. 9, and then attempt the follow-on crewed mission that the company has said will take place no earlier than December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boeing-postpones-starliner-capsule-test-flight-to-space-due-to-glitch-101628005743309.html

A 165-page long report probing the sexual harassment allegations against Cuomo revealed that the governor’s “sexually harassing behaviour” was not limited to members of his own staff members but extended to other State employees.“This is a sad day for New York because independent investigators have concluded that Governor Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women and, in doing so, broke the law,” James said in a statement.After James appointed the investigative team in early March, the investigators interviewed 179 people and took testimony under oath from 41 of them. These included women who have accused Cuomo of sexual harassment and other inappropriate conduct. The investigators, led by Joon H. Kim and Anne L. Clark, found that Cuomo and his aides retaliated against at least one former employee for coming forward with her story.A woman, identified in the report as Executive Assistant #1, said that the governor’s behaviour ranged from "playful banter" about her potential romantic relationships to asking about her social and dating lives. Over time, the report said, Cuomo's behaviour escalated to more intimate physical contact, culminating in an incident where the governor reached under her “blouse and grabbed her breast.”“I am grateful to all the women who came forward to tell their stories in painstaking detail, enabling investigators to get to the truth. No man — no matter how powerful — can be allowed to harass women or violate our human rights laws, period,” James added.The report said that the Executive Chambered fostered a “toxic” workplace that enabled “harassment to occur and created a hostile work environment.” While the investigators find his actions and those of the Executive Chamber violated multiple state and federal laws, they have not suggested any punishment for the governor in the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-governor-andrew-cuomo-sexually-harassed-multiple-women-probe-finds-101628008205788.html

Citing the data from the United Nations, the White House said in a statement that the number of doses donated by the US is more than the donations of all other countries combined which “cements the United States as the global leader in Covid-19 vaccine donations.”US President Joe Biden has promised the country will be an “arsenal of vaccines” for the world amid fear of inequitable vaccine distribution in low- and lower-middle-income countries. Biden is expected to discuss the milestone later Tuesday, providing an update on his administration’s strategy to stop the spread of Covid-19 abroad.Indonesia, the Philippines, Pakistan, Bangladesh and South Africa received the largest chunk of the vaccines donated by the US. While Pakistan and Bangladesh received 5.5 million Covid-19 vaccines each, Indonesia received 8 million vaccines. The Philippines and South Africa are also major beneficiaries, getting 6.2 million and 5.6 million shots respectively.The White House stressed that these donations will not be used to secure favours from other countries. “The Administration looks at a variety of factors, including Covid-19 case rates, death rates, and hospitalizations; current vaccination rates; responses to surges; and a country’s ability to receive vaccines and put shots into arms,” it added.The United States has made the vaccine donations largely through a global vaccine program called COVAX. The White House stated that the US will start shipping 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccine at the end of August that it has pledged to donate to 100 low-income countries by June 2022.The announcement comes as the US has started witnessing a fresh surge in infections, mostly among the unvaccinated. The administration is encouraging states to incentivise people to get vaccinated against Covid-19 since vaccine hesitancy has slowed down the inoculation drive, especially in the southern states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-indonesia-among-biggest-beneficiaries-of-over-110-mn-vaccines-donated-by-us-101628004456335.html

(and) didn't seem remorseful".Intelligence shared by prison authorities with police four months before the attack in October 2019 also suggested he was involved in radicalising other inmates there.Britain passed emergency laws last year to stop convicted terrorists from being automatically released part-way through their prison sentences following Amman's rampage and a deadly knife attack near London Bridge in November 2019.In that prior incident Usman Khan, 28, stabbed two people to death while attending a prisoner rehabilitation programme less than a year after he had been released from jail under strict conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-attacker-had-vowed-to-kill-the-queen-join-isis-101628000817149.html

It will be the Starliner's second unmanned test flight. Boeing’s spacecraft will carry more than 400 pounds of cargo and crew supplies to the space station and return to the Earth with more than 550 pounds of cargo, according to Nasa.The spacecraft will blast off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket at 1.20pm EDT (10.50pm IST) on August 3. Nasa said that the Starliner will start performing its orbital insertion burn about 30 minutes after the launch. The spacecraft is scheduled to dock at the space station at 1.37pm EDT (11.07pm IST) on Wednesday.Orbital Flight Test-2 (OFT-2) is aimed at demonstrating the end-to-end capabilities of the capsule-and-rocket combo, from launch, docking and landing in the western United States.Also Read | Perseids meteor shower to light up night skies in August. When and how to watchThe launch was earlier scheduled for Friday last week but an incident throwing the space station out of control forced the mission controllers to reschedule it. An unplanned firing of jet thrusters of the Russian research module due to a “short-term software failure” knocked the ISS off its course causing a “loss of attitudinal control” that lasted for a little more than 45 minutes. Nasa assured that ground teams restored the attitudinal control and orientation of the space station by activating thrusters on another module attached to it."The crew is now busy balancing the pressure in the Nauka module. In the afternoon, the crew will open the hatches, enter the module, turn on the necessary means of purifying the atmosphere and begin normal regular work," Vladimir Solovyov, designer general at Energia, a Russian space agency company, had said in a statement.The launch and docking activities for the Boeing OFT-2 will be aired live on Nasa TV and its website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-boeing-oft-2-mission-with-starliner-atlas-v-rocket-set-for-launch-101627990720934.html

Stanford University astrophysicist Dan Wilkins and his colleagues were observing X-rays released by a supermassive black hole 800 million light-years away when the telescopes recorded additional flashes of X-rays smaller and of different colours than the bright flares.“Any light that goes into that black hole doesn’t come out, so we shouldn’t be able to see anything that’s behind the black hole,” Wilkins, the author of the study, said in a statement.While the bright flares are not an unusual phenomenon, the X-rays reflecting from behind the black hole was a strange discovery. Material falling into a supermassive black hole gets superheated due to the enormous gravity around it, powering continuous sources of light in the universe by forming corona.Also Read | Researchers observe never before seen short gamma-ray burst from collapsing starWhen the electrons separate from atoms at such a high temperature, a magnetic plasma is created. The magnetic field breaks as it arch high above the black hole and then bends towards it, producing high energy electrons that subsequently produce the X-rays. Researchers determined that the series of smaller flashes were the same X-ray flares but reflected from behind the black hole.“I’ve been building theoretical predictions of how these echoes appear to us for a few years,” said Wilkins. “I’d already seen them in the theory I’ve been developing, so once I saw them in the telescope observations, I could figure out the connection.”The study, published late last month in the journal Nature, is the first direct observation of light from behind a black hole."Fifty years ago, when astrophysicists starting speculating about how the magnetic field might behave close to a black hole, they had no idea that one day we might have the techniques to observe this directly and see Einstein’s general theory of relativity in action,” said Roger Blandford, a co-author of the paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-strange-discovery-scientists-detect-light-behind-black-hole-for-first-time-101627985533999.html

However, the whistleblower succumbed to the viral disease in February last year, leading to widespread public anger against the government.China has so far reported 93,193 cases, 4,636 deaths and 87,400 recoveries due to Covid-19. However, the real figures could be much higher than the official data. On Tuesday, the country reported 90 new Covid-19 cases, compared to 98 a day earlier, according to the National Health Commission. And of Tuesday’s case count, 61 infections were locally transmitted.The recent emergence of the Delta variant is also placing a huge challenge for the world’s second-largest economy. China’s stringent anti-Covid norms, which include mass testing as soon as a case emerges, aggressive contact tracing, widespread use of quarantines and targeted lockdowns, are also being put to test with the widespread increase of the variant.“The Delta variant is the biggest test of China’s zero-Covid strategy since the initial outbreak last year,” Julian Evans-Pritchard, a senior China economist at Capital Economics, told Reuters on Monday, adding he assumes that the country will quash the outbreak before it goes out of control.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-wuhan-to-test-all-residents-for-covid-19-as-virus-returns-101627963710089.html

"These murders could constitute war crimes," the embassies said in separate tweets.Taliban leadership must be held responsible, they said.

NSO owns the Pegasus spyware.According to the Guardian report, the French agency for information systems security, called Anssi, detected digital traces of the spyware on the TV journalist’s phone. Anssi shared the findings with the Paris public prosecutor’s office, which is overseeing the probe into possible hacking.It also found the Pegasus spyware on phones belonging to Lénaïg Bredoux, a journalist at the French investigative website Mediapart, and the site’s director, Edwy Plenel.“We are stupefied and angry that journalists could be the object of spying. We will not be taking this lying down. There will be legal action,” a source at France 24 said.Paris-based Forbidden Stories says about 180 journalists across the world may have been selected as possible targets for surveillance by government clients of NSO Group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spyware-found-on-phones-of-journos-french-intelligence-101627952834969.html
03-08-2021||World||Lindsey Graham first vaccinated US senator to test positive for Covid-19||Sen. Lindsey Graham has become the first senator to disclose a breakthrough infection after being vaccinated against the coronavirus, saying Monday he is “very glad” he received the vaccine, without which his current symptoms would be “far worse.”The news prompted several other lawmakers to get quick Covid-19 tests and report their status. A handful of Senate colleagues spent part of the weekend working and socializing with the South Carolina Republican, who attended a gathering on Sen. Joe Manchin’s houseboat the evening that he first developed symptoms.In a statement issued Monday afternoon, Graham said he “started having flu-like symptoms Saturday night” and went to the doctor Monday morning.After being notified of his positive test, Graham said he would quarantine for 10 days.“I feel like I have a sinus infection, and at present time, I have mild symptoms,” the 66-year-old Graham said. “I am very glad I was vaccinated because without vaccination, I am certain I would not feel as well as I do now. My symptoms would be far worse.”According to spokesman Kevin Bishop, Graham was among senators who attended Manchin's event on Saturday. Sam Runyon, a spokeswoman for Manchin, said the West Virginia Democrat "is fully vaccinated and following the CDC guidelines for those exposed to a COVID positive individual.”In the Capitol Monday evening, senators who attended the gathering were present and voting. Manchin said he had since tested negative and said the outdoor event, which lasted several hours and featured hamburgers, was “just trying to get people together.”“We do everything in a bipartisan way, and that’s what we do,” Manchin said. “I talked to Lindsey today, he's fine.”Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., told reporters that he was also on the boat, named “Almost Heaven,” and was awaiting test results. Sens. John Thune, R-S.D., and Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., were also there and were getting tested.More senators have donned masks in recent weeks as coronavirus case counts have risen, but they aren’t required in the chamber, and some still choose not to wear them. The House has returned to a mask requirement.Senate Democrats will switch back to a virtual caucus lunch Tuesday at the Capitol amid the virus surge. Republicans had been quicker to resume in-person meetings last year, but there was no word if their lunch plans would now change.Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a Republican who is vaccinated, was not wearing a mask Monday and said he had not decided whether to put one back on. He said he’s concerned that reports of Graham’s illness will discourage some to get vaccinated.On wearing a mask, Blunt said, “I think it actually is one of the reasons that people are encouraged to get the vaccine is they don’t have to.”There’s no way to know just how risky it was for the people who were near Graham — vaccinated or not. Vaccinated people are at a much lower risk of being infected at all and for contracting a serious case. But the level of risk depends on whether Graham was masked, whether they were masked, how much virus his body was producing when they met, how close they were and for how long.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fully vaccinated people determined to have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 do not need to quarantine if they are asymptomatic but should be tested within five days and wear a mask indoors for 14 days or until testing negative.Graham, who was vaccinated in December, has long been a proponent of vaccination, saying during a visit this spring to the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston that “the sooner we get everybody vaccinated, the quicker we can get back to normal.”Graham's infection comes on the heels of updated CDC guidance urging even fully vaccinated people to return to wearing masks indoors in areas of high coronavirus transmission, citing the surge of the highly contagious delta variant. Recent analysis has shown that breakthrough cases of COVID-19, with mild or no symptoms, still remain rare.Both congressional chambers have been adopting stricter face covering regulations amid a resurgence in COVID-19 cases across the country.Graham, who was wearing a mask, did not answer questions from reporters on Capitol Hill earlier Monday, prior to the statement being issued. Because of Senate votes, Graham was not in attendance at Friday night’s Silver Elephant dinner, the South Carolina Republican Party’s signature annual fundraiser and an event attended by hundreds, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a headlining speaker.___Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP.___Mary Clare Jalonick and Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report from Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lindsey-graham-first-vaccinated-us-senator-to-test-positive-for-covid19-101627951534324.html

03-08-2021||World||Indian student allegedly murdered on Chinese varsity campus||A 20-year-old Indian student was allegedly murdered in his university room in the city of Tianjin, around 100km south of Beijing, last week, a family member said on Monday.The body of Aman Nagsen was found by the staff of Tianjin Foreign Studies University (TFSU) on Thursday in his room on the university campus. Nagsen was enrolled for the International Business Studies course and was from Gaya in Bihar. Details are sketchy about the case with neither the local police nor the Indian embassy in Beijing releasing particulars about it.The Chinese foreign ministry is yet to respond to a query from the Hindustan Times on the crime, which has many in the Indian diaspora in China abuzz.It could not be immediately confirmed if a foreign national was involved in the alleged murder.“We were informed about the death of my nephew by the university at 1am in the intervening night of July 29th and 30th,” the deceased’s uncle Pankaj Paswan said from Gaya.Late on Monday, Paswan, who has been in constant touch with officials at the Indian embassy in Beijing, told HT it was “murder” after being asked whether Nagsen’s family members suspected foul play behind the death of Nagsen.Family members had been informed about Tianjin police’s initial findings, HT learnt from official sources.Indian embassy officials here remained tight-lipped because of the “sensitivity” of the matter.Last week, worried family members got in touch with Nagsen’s local guardian in Beijing after being unable to contact him for several days.The local guardian in turn got in touch with TFSU authorities, persuading them to look him up.That was when Nagsen’s body was found in the room.Nagsen’s family last spoke to him on July 23 after which he did not respond to calls or messages and did not accept a money transfer via a mobile app.While the 20-year-old’s body was recovered in the intervening night of July 29 and 30, several questions remain unanswered including the exact time and date of the crime and, most importantly, motive.On July 30, Bihar’s BJP chief, Sanjay Jaiswal, tweeted about the death of the student and asked the embassy to intervene in bringing the youth’s body home.The Indian embassy responded in a tweet saying it was in communication with Chinese authorities and the deceased’s family and was “providing all possible assistance”.A distraught Paswan, the uncle quoted earlier, said the family has urgently requested the Indian government through the external affairs ministry to help in getting Nagsen’s body back in India. “We request both the Indian and Chinese governments to help in sending the body back to India,” he said.Paswan added that a demonstration was organised by a group of students in Gaya to demand the quick return of Nagsen’s remains.The news of Nagsen’s death was being shared among social media groups involving Indians with links to China and many requested the Indian embassy to urgently look into the matter as well.It was learnt that officials from the Indian embassy in Beijing are working on repatriating Nagsen’s remains to India and are in touch with authorities in Tianjin.As per Chinese protocol in such cases, autopsy is likely to be conducted before the body is released to be taken back to India.Nagsen was among the few Indian students to have remained in China following the Covid-19 outbreak here.The vast majority of around 23,000 Indian students studying here had returned to India by themselves or via evacuation flights in 2020.They have not been able to return to China because of the ban on the return of foreign students imposed by Beijing because of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-student-allegedly-murdered-on-chinese-varsity-campus-101627929987929.html

The ministers also agreed to make vaccination available for all children in the age group of 12 and 17.The citizens will be inoculated with mRNA-vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna irrespective of the jabs they had originally been administered; the ministers confirmed following discourse with the federal health minister Jens Spahn.This development comes amid speculations of the country imposing curbs and lockdowns owing to the rise of cases from the Delta variant of Covid-19, even as Europe’s largest economy sees an approaching general election next month, the Reuters report added.The 16 states manage their own health affairs, and are keen on administering coronavirus vaccines to more people in order to keep the fourth wave of the virus outbreak at bay. A little over 52% of the population has been fully vaccinated and nearly 62% have received at least one jab.The ministers pointed out that vaccinated children between 12 and 17 is voluntary, and will only be proceeded with after parental consent and a medical check-up that negates any serious health risk, is provided.Notably, German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced in May that the country will begin offering coronavirus vaccine jabs to children aged over 12 from June 12 onwards. “The main message to parents is: there will be no compulsory vaccinations,” she told reporters at the time.Merkel had, however, urged parents to be patient saying that not every parent would get an appointment to get their child vaccinated against coronavirus.Also Read | 'Covid-19 not over yet': Germany to vaccinate children over 12 from June 7Canada and the US have already started administering vaccine doses to children over 12.Nearly 10% of the 4.5 million children in Germany in the said age group have already been fully vaccinated. Meanwhile, the country has been witnessing over 2,000 new cases every day since Wednesday.

03-08-2021||India||Nagaland assembly adopts resolution, NSCN (IM) protests against Centre’s silence||Nagaland assembly on Tuesday adopted a resolution asking all Naga political groups to unite to expedite the peace process while the Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN-IM) registered its protest against the Centre’s “silence” on the Framework Agreement which they had signed six years ago to resolve the Naga issue.Major towns in Nagaland including the streets of state capital Kohima bore a deserted look on Tuesday morning after the NSCN (IM) called for a 12-hour closure of shops and business establishments across Naga inhabited areas to protest against the Center’s alleged “delay in fulfilling its commitment” on the Naga peace process, made through the Framework Agreement which was signed on 3rd August 2015. The issue dominated the opening day of the monsoon session of the state assembly too, resulting in the adoption of a five-point resolution calling for various Naga political groups to come together and to expedite the peace process.The house appealed to the negotiating parties of the Indo-Naga political issue to resume the peace talks with a positive approach and mutual respect by setting aside pre-conditions, in deference to the Naga people’s cry for long term peace, and resolve the contentious issues of the competencies at the earliest. “The House appeals to all Naga political groups to make serious efforts towards unity and reconciliation. The constant antagonism against each other, especially in public space and the media is sending out a wrong message to the masses, considering the fact that we are all pursuing the same aspiration of peace and political solution. Taking the positive example set by the elected members of the Nagaland Legislative Assembly, who have risen above party affiliations to unite for the Naga political issue, the Naga political groups should make concerted efforts, and listen to the voice of the people for unity and oneness,” stated the resolution, which was moved by chief minister Neiphiu Rio and later adopted unanimously by a voice vote.The House also appealed to the mass-based organisations and the Tribal bodies to make renewed efforts towards creating a conducive atmosphere for the early realisation of a political solution by pursuing unity, reconciliation and oneness. The house also resolved that all the elected members were prepared to make any sacrifices for an inclusive, honourable and acceptable solution. “The House, therefore, appeals to the Naga political negotiating groups to come together in order to hammer out their differences, and give the people One Solution and One Agreement,” the resolution further stated.Meanwhile, the NSCN (IM) issued a statement thanking owners of shops and business establishments in Nagaland and other Naga inhabited areas for “exhibiting the courage to show solidarity to the Framework Agreement”, the Naga people and public for bearing with the inconveniences during the 12-hour closure shutdown.Besides the NSCN (IM), which has been in a ceasefire agreement with the Centre since 1997, a conglomeration of seven different Naga national political groups (NNPGs) were also involved in separate talks with the Centre since 2017. The Centre signed a Framework Agreement with NSCN (IM) in 2015 and it also inked an “agreed position” with the NNPGs in 2017. While it is largely claimed that negotiations have concluded, the NSCN (IM)’s demand for a separate Naga flag and constitution has been a delaying factor in signing a final deal on the Naga peace process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-assembly-adopts-resolution-nscn-im-protests-against-centre-s-silence-101628014832086.html
03-08-2021||India||Delhi not adequately accessible for its residents, finds study||Delhi has ignored the needs of low-income settlements by providing access to adequate public transport and sufficient street space, thereby distancing them from centres of economic opportunity and state-of-the-art services that the national capital offers to planned and richer neighbourhoods, a recent study conducted by policy think-tank Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) found.The study also sheds light on the elephant in the room: Less-then-ideal last-mile connectivity and haphazard urban designs distance cities from sustainable mobility solutions that emerge from the travel patterns of the poor.The report, How accessible are low-income settlements: The case of Delhi, released on Tuesday showed that unplanned, low-income areas in the national capital region have very limited access to affordable and efficient public transport services while the planned and swankier areas are comparatively better connected, but are still not up to the mark."If all settlements of Delhi — planned and unplanned — are not equally well connected with public transport services and are not made accessible, the capital will fail to implement fully its sustainable, low-emission forms of travel such as walking, cycling or public transport," the report highlighted.As per the estimates of the draft Delhi Master Plan 2041 (MPD 2041), the city’s population is expected to touch 27-to-30 million by 2041, and 50% of this increase would happen on account of migration. By then, Delhi would generate 46.2 million motorised trips every day.“If such a massive load of daily motorised travel trips are not shifted to public transport to achieve the MPD 2041 target of a modal split of 80:20 in favour of public and shared transport, Delhi will remain locked in pollution and carbon trap,” says CSE executive director Anumita Roychowdhury.The CSE conducted a ground-level assessment of infrastructure for accessibility in 16 settlements in the southern part of Delhi and took into account neighbourhoods of varying economic status, with a special focus on the vulnerable urban poor.The diverse settlements included unauthorised colonies that have been subsequently regularised such as Tughlakabad Extension, Tigri Extension, Govindpuri, Kalkaji, Khanpur, Pooth Kalan and Khirki Extension; resettlement colonies like Garhi and Zamrudpur in East of Kailash; and slum clusters like Jawaharlal Nehru Camp in Kalkaji. There are also villages that have become part of the urban system like Shahpur Jat and Tughlakabad village.On the other hand, the study also focussed on planned settlements and neighbourhoods of higher-income groups, including East of Kailash, Kailash Colony, Greater Kailash and Chittaranjan Park."While it is challenging to quantify the differences in absolute terms, indicators have been derived from national policies, guidelines, service-level benchmarks, the Ease of Living Index of the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, and a few global indexes related to liveability and accessibility – the aim was to broadly assess the qualitative differences between settlements, the CSE said, adding, "This is a rapid diagnostic study of equity of access, ease and affordability of movement and what determines access in different settlements."The study found that the planned settlements and higher-income neighbourhoods perform better on most criteria compared to unplanned settlements inhabited by the people from the economically weaker section of the society. However, even planned colonies were found to be falling short of the benchmark for accessibility as provided in guidelines and standards and are deficient in public transport-oriented design.Experts warned that the trend is an indication of over-dependence on personal vehicles in these neighbourhoods.“These indicators bring out the relative differences in local conditions related to transport, mobility patterns and connectivity, the status of infrastructure and services, accessibility, and the increase in interchanges due to poor connectivity that has a bearing on journey costs,” says Anannya Das, deputy programme manager with the sustainable mobility programme at CSE.Unplanned colonies, on the other hand, are hugely burdened with legacy problems as they have grown incrementally and without any planning support. They are already very densely built with hugely constrained infrastructure. There is barely any space left to manoeuvre as all vacant and open spaces have ceased to exist.The study found out that the planned areas have, on average, 1.6 times more road space and 1.4 times more open qualitative spaces than the unplanned parts of the city mostly inhabited by people from the economically-weaker section of the society.It further pointed out that planned settlements are about 1.3 times better connected than low-income unplanned settlements. Within the low-income settlements, planned low-income settlements have relatively better chances of being located strategically in relation to a major economic hub and important locations within a city."In unplanned low-income settlements, inter-modal transfer requirement increases the waiting time for a mode by 1.1–1.6 times. Most importantly, this increases the cost of the journey. In fact, the monthly cost of transport increases by 1.5–3.5 times," the CSE finding read.Meanwhile, Roychodhury said the need of the hour was an immediate improvement in neighbourhood-scale accessibility to bus and metro services and minimisation of interchanges."The expectation of MPD 2041 that 50% of Delhi’s population will be within the influence zone of mass transit by 2041 and mixed-use development will encourage a shift towards public transport, can be fulfilled only if neighbourhood-level design and infrastructure improvements for safe and efficient access,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-cse-study-urban-mobility-planned-settlements-transport-facilities-101627998519185.html
03-08-2021||India||BJP arms party MPs with factsheet on Covid response ahead of assembly polls||Expecting the Centre’s handling of the second wave of the Covid pandemic to become a major poll issue in the 2022 state assembly elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has armed its lawmakers with a 34-page booklet, detailing the actions that were taken by the Union government during the crisis. The booklet, drafted by the union ministry of health and family welfare was handed out to the MPs at the BJP’s parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday with the instruction to publicise its contents widely to “counter” the Opposition’s charges against the government’s performance. A party functionary said the details in the booklet will help the lawmakers answer the questions on the government’s response when the party hits the ground for electioneering in states such Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur, where the impact of the pandemic is expected to be a major poll issue. Apart from these states, elections will also be held in Himachal Pradesh and Punjab next year. Systemic deficiencies exposed during the pandemic resulted in shortfall of oxygen, essential drugs and hospital beds across several states; the Opposition has accused the union government of being unprepared and for focusing on elections in West Bengal instead of containing the spread of the virus that took many lives in the second wave in April and May. The document also lists the quantities of essential medicines such as Remdesivir, Amphotericin B, medical oxygen and the grants that were supplied to each state and UT. As per the document, ₹1,113 crore was sanctioned to 36 states and UTs in the financial year 2019-20 under the national health mission for management and containment of the pandemic while ₹8,257 crore was sanctioned under the emergency response and health system preparedness package in the financial year 2020-21. Referring to the challenges faced during the second wave by the government, the document says, “Due to ongoing field activities in terms of increased testing, surveillance, clinical management and other activities for more than one year, the health system witnessed fatigue.…” It also says that the Health systems in peri- urban and rural areas were strained due to sudden surge in cases amid limited capacity of beds, testing, drugs, oxygen and logistics. Since the Opposition has also questioned the country’s vaccination policy, the booklet has an annexure that details how the vaccination drive has been carried out across India and how it compares to other nations. It says, by July 31, India has administered 456 million doses of the vaccine, of which 120.3 million were administered in July alone. In the corresponding time, UK has administered 84 million doses, the US 343 million doses and Brazil 137 million doses, the booklet says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-arms-party-mps-with-factsheet-on-covid-response-ahead-of-assembly-polls-101628012852601.html
03-08-2021||India||Serosurveys can’t be deduced to estimate undercounting of Covid-19 cases: Centre||Serosurvey reports cannot be deduced to estimate mortality rates of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) or the undercounting of people infected with the virus as they are not meant to cover granularity at state level, NITI Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul said on Tuesday. “This isn't the way interpretation of data should be done or convey misleading information,” he added.The statements came amid claims by opposition leaders regarding undercounting of coronavirus cases by the Centre.During the Covid-19 press briefing earlier in the day, Dr Paul, on being asked about the fourth round of Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) national serosurvey, said that it is carried out with the “specific purpose of enunciating how many people have previous experience of Covid-19.”Dr Paul further explained that all the serosurveys that have been done till now have been done to portray the “national picture of Covid-19.” “Having said that, remember if the antibody is found in any person, it shows that the person has been exposed to Covid-19,” the NITI Aayog member said, adding that mere exposure doesn’t mean it was a case of a “serious disease” or indicates a “life-threatening situation.”Moreover, if in such scenarios, the person in question hasn't got the Covid-19 test done, it is more likely that the case may have been asymptomatic or totally known to the individual, Dr Paul said.“In most cases, above 80%, there are no symptoms; you are totally unaware. This situation cannot be equated with a situation where there is a significant chance of mortality,” he added.The government official further pointed out that serosurveys involve a large number of people who are asymptomatic, and extrapolating those is “irrational and biased.”He said that coronavirus vaccination could also be the reason why antibodies are found in an individual. “At least some part of it has come from the vaccine, and the vaccine is protective. Making a mathematical calculation and drawing a picture of your own is not scientifically valid. This is not a way of data interpretation,” Dr Paul said during the press briefing.The recently released results of the fourth round of national serosurvey, which was conducted across 70 districts in June to July, revealed about 40 crore Indians are still vulnerable to coronavirus as they didn’t have antibodies.The latest serosurvey also included children aged between six and 17, and it showed that two-third of the general population – above six-years-old, had developed Covid-19 antibodies.ICMR director-general, Dr Balram Bhargava, said that the total seroprevalence stood at 67.6%, of which, those between 45 and 60 accounted for the highest at 77.6%. Citizens between 18-44 had 66.7% seroprevalence, while those in the six to nine-year age group and 10-17 years were found to have 57.2% and 61.6% seroprevalence, respectively.Meanwhile, at the same press briefing, joint secretary of Union ministry of health and family welfare, Lav Agarwal said that as many as 18 districts in India are showing an upward trend in daily Covid-19 cases. A total of 10 districts are in Kerala, while three are in Maharashtra – two of the most-affected states in India.Also Read | 18 districts showing rise in daily Covid-19 cases; 10 are in Kerala: CentreBesides, these two states account for 60% of the total active case count in the country, with Kerala’s tally currently at 1,65,834 and Maharashtra’s at 78,700, he further told the media persons.(With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serosurveys-can-t-be-deduced-to-estimate-undercounting-of-covid-19-cases-centre-101628011923606.html

It is a matter of concern because anti-social elements in border areas can plan attacks on common people in Assam using these drones, the official order said. “We have declared all the areas under Sonai Revenue Circle and those bordering Mizoram state as no drone zones, where flying of drones and any other unnamed aerial vehicles will be strictly prohibited.... The decision has been taken considering the present situation,” Cachar deputy commissioner Keerthi Jalli said.After the firing between Assam and Mizoram police on July 26, the border areas in both the states are tense.

03-08-2021||India||No arrests made in connection with 2020 JNU violence: Centre||On Tuesday, the Central government informed Parliament that Delhi Police haven’t arrested anyone so far in connection with the violence that took place in the Jawaharlal Nehru University in January 2020.While replying to the question of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) Member of Parliament (MP) Dayanidhi Maran, minister of state for home Nityanand Rai said the Delhi Police have constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of Crime Branch to investigate three cases registered at Vasant Kunj police station in south Delhi regarding the January 2020 violence in JNU campus. “The investigation conducted inter-alia includes the examination of witnesses; collection and analysis of footages; and examination of identified suspects. As reported by Delhi Police, no arrest has been made in these cases” Rai further said in Lok Sabha.Tagging the reply, the DMK leader tweeted, “Sad to see that a year and a half later, no progress has been made to deliver justice to the students of JNU.”On January 5, 2020, around 100 masked individuals, armed with rods and hammers, unleashed violence at the JNU campus, attacking students and ransacking hostels and other buildings for four hours before the police intervened, leaving 36 students,staff and teachers injured. An FIR against the attack was filed and the case was transferred to the Crime Branch.Several witness accounts and videos indicated that in most places, police personnel present at JNU did almost nothing to stop the violence, and, in fact, allowed the attackers to exit the university without apprehending them.JNU Students Union president Aishe Ghosh was among the several students who suffered severe injuries in the attack and her photos with a bleeding head triggered widespread anger across the nation.Soon, the JNU students launched major protests against the attack both inside and outside the boundaries of the campus. Several student unions and colleges stood in solidarity and protests emerged in various cities like Mumbai, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Ahmedabad.Several opposition leaders had denounced the violence and accused the central government of being involved in the attack on students. However, the BJP had said that the violence was “ a desperate attempt by forces of anarchy, who are determined to use students as cannon fodder”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-arrests-made-in-connection-with-2020-jnu-violencecentre-101628009551788.html
03-08-2021||India||Violence in Afghanistan could affect neighbourhood and beyond: Jaishankar||The violent transition underway in Afghanistan has exacerbated the challenge posed by terrorism and its impact will be felt in the neighbourhood and beyond if it is left unattended, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Tuesday. In a virtual address to the inaugural session of the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) Academic Forum, Jaishankar reiterated India’s concerns about the legitimacy of any dispensation that comes to power in Kabul through force and called for an inclusive set-up that ensures peace and stability. India has been concerned by the Taliban’s violent campaign to capture territory across Afghanistan, which last week expanded to key cities such as Herat, Lashkargah and Kandahar. New Delhi has maintained that any regime that seeks to capture power through military force will not be legitimate. In his speech, Jaishankar said terrorism thrives in some of the gaps that emerged after multilateral institutions were disadvantaged by “structural inertia, competitive gridlocks, uneven resourcing and skewed navigation”. The nursery of terrorism “lies in conflict-ridden spaces made fertile for radicalisation by malign players, including states”, Jaishankar said, in a tacit reference to Pakistan’s role in backing the Taliban. “The transition in Afghanistan that we are seeing today and the warfare that has yet again been forced upon its people has sharpened this challenge. Left unattended, its edge will be deeply felt not just in Afghanistan’s neighbourhood but well beyond,” he said. “We are, therefore, all stakeholders in the quest for a clear, coordinated and undifferentiated response to terrorism. In the 21st century, legitimacy cannot be derived from mass violence, brutal intimidation or covert agendas. Representation, inclusion, peace and stability are inextricably linked,” he said. The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent normative breakdown have “rudely reminded us that institutions built to tackle problems of the 1940s desperately need to be upgraded and made fit-for-purpose for our century”, Jaishankar said. An expansion of the permanent membership of the UN Security Council is not sufficient to address the gaps that have emerged because multilateral institutions are unable to cope with contemporary challenges, he added. “Too often, we obsess with one or the other response, more effort and action is actually required to fill the gaps,” Jaishankar said. India’s presidency of Brics in 2021 has come at an “inflection point” for the grouping and the pandemic has “demanded a price in terms of economic growth” and challenged timelines for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). “Technology could help us now recover ground and time. India is optimistic on this score, and ready to share what it has harnessed, innovated and learnt in these last years,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/violence-in-afghanistan-could-affect-neighbourhood-and-beyond-jaishankar-101628008111799.html

Occasionally, such helicopters may be required to operate over water. That’s ‘risk exposure,’ he said.The helicopter belonged to the army’s Pathankot-based 254 ALH-WSI squadron, which lost a Rudra chopper in January 2021. Four Rudra helicopters have been involved in mishaps in as many years.The Rudra is a weaponised version of the indigenously built advanced light helicopter Dhruv. The army operates six Rudra squadrons with 10 helicopters each.Search and rescue involved specialized divers and Dhruv and Cheetah helicopters. In the evening, a heavy-lift Chinook helicopter also joined the search.Locals claimed the chopper used to hover over the dam and drop a pipe into the water every day. The moment it dropped the pipe on Tuesday morning, it crashed, they added.Kathua SSP Ramesh Kotwal said the chopper crashed around 10.45 am. “While deep water divers are on the job, the operation will take time. Police and local boatmen retrieved some floating material from the lake. It will take time to retrieve the entire wreckage. We retrieved two helmets,” he said, adding that the lake was up to 250 feet deep.“The area where the chopper crashed has been zeroed in. Special Forces of the army, deep water divers are on the job, but the water is not clear,” he said.Army ambulances, two helicopters, senior army officers and civil administration officials were present on the spot. The dam is located about 30 km from Pathankot.There are four weapon stations on the Rudra with a turret gun in its nose area. The helicopters are also equipped with air-to-air missiles, 70 mm rockets and 20 mm turret guns. Capable of firing anti-tank guided missiles, it is also equipped with infrared jammers and obstacle avoidance systems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/helmets-i-card-recovered-from-army-chopper-crash-site-pilots-missing-101628005351709.html

It targeted nearly 800 million people with provision for 5 kg wheat or rice and 1 kg of preferred pulses for free for 11 months in total during the two waves of the pandemic. It also offered monetary assistance to Jan Dhan accounts holding women, poor senior citizens, widows and disabled and increased MNREGA wages to labourers. The government had previously claimed that it was highly successful, however, one study suggested the scheme may not have delivered the full quantum of benefits to a large section of the targeted people. On Tuesday, the Prime Minister said a continuous increase in the budget and spread of cheap food grains schemes for 70 years have had a limited impact because of “selfish elements and ineffective delivery systems.”Modi said this was the reason for increase in starvation and malnutrition despite a huge expansion in food storages.As against this, the PMGKAY helped millions of poor people through free distribution of free rations during the pandemic with the use of new technology to make the delivery more effective, Modi said.“Since Independence, almost every government has talked about providing cheap food to the poor. The scope and budget of cheap ration schemes increased year after year, but the effect it should have had remained limited. The country’s food reserves increased, but hunger and malnutrition did not decrease in that proportion,” he said.He said because earlier governments remained ineffective, “Some sickness crept into the system and selfish elements ruled the roost.”Modi claimed that after he took over in 2014, crores of fake beneficiaries were removed using new approach and new technology, and ration cards were linked with Aadhar cards along with adoption of digital technology in government fair price shops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/free-ration-scheme-helping-poor-earlier-govts-paid-lip-service-modi-101628003011542.html

Among the remaining five districts, two are in Manipur, and one each in Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram.The Centre further stated that the 10 districts of Kerala accounted for 40.6 per cent of the total number of coronavirus cases in the country in the last one week. Furthermore, these 18 districts are reporting 10 weekly average Covid-19 cases as of August 1.Stressing fresh coronavirus cases are being reported from a “limited trajectory or area,” the Centre highlighted that 49.85% of total cases in India last week were reported from Kerala.Addressing the active cases of Covid-19 in the country, the Centre said that the case count has dipped from 4,14,188 on May 7 to 30,549 on August 3. Notably, the second wave of the pandemic was at its peak between April and June this year.As far as state-wise data is concerned, as many as eight Indian states and Union territories (UTs) currently have 10,000 to 1,00,000 active cases. Kerala is the only state where the active caseload is more than one lakh (1,65,834) — constituting 40.95% of the total active case count of India. Maharashtra, on the other hand, has 78,700 active cases, which comprises 19.43% of the total active caseload.Those coronavirus patients, who are either under home isolation or under the active supervision in a healthcare centre, constitute a state or UT’s active case count, the Centre explained.“Looking at the scenario from this understanding, it is to be noted that even in terms of active cases, Kerala and Maharashtra constitute 60 per cent of the total caseload,” Agarwal said.Besides Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Odisha, Assam, Mizoram and West Bengal are the states where active caseload currently stands between 10,000 to 1,00,000.As many as 27 states and UTs, however, have shown significant drop in the number of active cases and currently have less than 10,000 infections.The Centre further pointed out that the weekly positivity rate has declined to less than 2% in India – 1.98% as of last week, for the first time in three months. This rate climbed up to 21.3% during the week of May 10 when the second wave of Covid-19 hit India.“This declining trend of weekly positivity is being maintained on a national level,” Agarwal added.However, there are as many as 44 districts that have 10% per cent weekly positivity rate. These are from Kerala, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Sikkim, Rajasthan, Puducherry, Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Assam.Meanwhile, the Centre said that the number of districts where more than 100 new Covid-19 cases are being reported in the country have decreased to 57 now from 279 on June 1. The government added that number cases saw a downward swing in 222 districts.Referring to Worldometer data, Aggarwal added that as many as 4,77,903 fresh coronavirus cases are still being reported every day across the globe. “The daily Covid-19 caseload reported worldwide is still very high…and as far as the second wave in India is concerned, it is not over.”Also Read | Covid third wave likely this month, may peak in October: ReportIndia on Tuesday reported 30,549 fresh infections, thereby taking the overall tally of the country to 31,726,507, according to the bulletin data of the Union health ministry.

The dam is located about 30 km from Pathankot. Kathua’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) Ramesh Kotwal said as per local residents, the crash took place around 10.43 am when the advanced light Dhruv helicopter was on a routine sortie after taking off from Mamun cantonment.Kathua.“We have pressed into service divers and motorboats but there is no clue so far,” Kotwal said. In the evening a heavy lift chopper, Chinook was also pressed into search and rescue operation. The SSP pointed out that the depth of the lake was between 200 to 250 feet in the area of the crash and while the rescue team including specialised forces had recovered some floating objects from the lake, retrieving the wreckage will take time. “Deep water divers are at the job, but the operation will take time. We have also retrieved two helmets, which are most likely of the two pilots, who were flying the helicopter,” Kotwal said, adding that the water was not clear. Army ambulances, two helicopters, senior army officers and civil administration officials were also on the spot.

The move will allow UAE residents from these six countries to return, provided 14 days have elapsed since they received the second vaccine dose. The travellers must possess vaccination certificates issued by authorities in their countries.According to the latest directive, both vaccinated and unvaccinated travellers from several other categories will also be allowed into the UAE from August 5.These categories include health workers such as doctors, nurses and technicians employed in the UAE, those working in the education sector, students, humanitarian cases with valid residency permits, and employees of federal and local government bodies. India has been pushing the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states, including the UAE, to allow Indian professionals and other workers to return to their jobs in West Asia by easing Covid-19 related travel restrictions. Some recent reports earlier suggested that the UAE could extend the restrictions into August.The UAE alone is home to 3.42 million Indians, one of the largest concentrations of expatriates in West Asia. A large number of doctors and nurses in the UAE are of Indian origin.The UAE imposed fresh travel restrictions on India and suspended flights following a second wave of Coronavirus infections earlier this year. Other categories of travellers from these six countries will continue to be barred from entering the emirates. Travellers will have to apply online through the website of the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship to get approval. Besides vaccination certificates, the applicants need to submit a negative PCR test result within 48 hours of the date of departure. A lab test will be conducted before they board the planes, and a PCR test will be done on arrival in the UAE. This will be followed by home quarantine. The UAE will also lift a ban on transit passenger traffic from the six countries from August 5. NCEMA said on Twitter that passengers from these countries will be able to transit through UAE airports as long as they present negative PCR tests taken 72 hours before departure.Final destination approval would also have to be provided and UAE departure airports will arrange separate lounges for transiting passengers, NCEMA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uae-residents-from-6-countries-including-india-can-return-after-vaccination-101627999051766.html

A pall of gloom has descended upon the family house in Gaya. “He was so good in studies and always remained in touch. We cannot believe he is no more,” said a family member. Nagsen’s body was found by the staff of Tianjin Foreign Studies University (TFSU) in his room on the university campus. The 20-year-old was enrolled for the International Business Studies course.Nagsen’s mother, Rita Devi, is inconsolable. “The last time he talked to us was on July 24. There was no communication after that,” she said. Nagsen’s sister, Jyotsna Chandra, a second-year student at DJ Dental College, Ghaziabad, alleged that her brother was murdered. “It is strange that despite Beijing town being barely half-an-hour drive from the university, no one from the Indian embassy went there [where the body was found],” she said to HT over the phone on Tuesday.Also Read | Foreign student in custody for murdering Indian student at university in ChinaOn the intervening night of July 29-30, the victim’s uncle, Ram Kishore Paswan, a BJP activist, got a call from the Tianjin Foreign Studies University, informing them about Nagsen’s death. He said he also got a mail from the Indian Embassy that the ministry of external affairs got a communication from Tianjin authorities about Nagsen’s death. This Monday, said Paswan, the embassy received another communication from the Tianjin local authorities that a suspect has been held in connection with Nagsen’s death. The family has met Gaya district magistrate Abhishek Singh with a request to initiate steps to bring back the body.

03-08-2021||India||BJP says 2 workers killed in Bengal after attack on Abhishek Banerjee’s car||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday alleged that two of its workers were murdered in Bengal by members of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). A day earlier on Monday, TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee posted a video in which some miscreants, alleged to be BJP workers, were seen shouting slogans against him while a man hit his car with a bamboo stick. The incident was condemned by Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya, who said the attackers were not BJP workers. However, Udayan Guha, a senior TMC leader from Dinhata in north Bengal’s Cooch Behar district, later wrote on his Facebook page that BJP workers and leaders in Dinhata would be “well taken care of” after what happened in Tripura. On Tuesday, the Bengal BJP alleged that Tapan Khatua, a party worker from Egra in East Midnapore district and Indrajit Sutradhar, another party worker from Khoyrasol in Birbhum district, were murdered by TMC workers between Monday night and Tuesday morning. While Khatua’s body was fished out from a pond, Sutradhar’s was found hanging in an abandoned house. “Khatua’s body has been sent for post-mortem examination. There was no apparent sign of violence but a probe is on,” an officer from Egra police station said on condition of anonymity. An officer from Khoyrasol police station said, “Sutradhar’s family said he left home on Monday night. There are reports that he had a dispute with some local villagers.” In both districts, TMC workers alleged that the BJP was trying to pass off unnatural deaths as murders to gain political mileage. Reacting to this, Samik Bhattacharya said, “It is unfortunate that every time a BJP worker dies in Bengal the ruling party says it is a case of suicide. There is no rule of law. Udayan Guha instigated this violence. The BJP has moved court and carried out democratic movements but post-poll violence has not stopped.” “If BJP workers attack Abhishek Banerjee’s car with bamboo sticks, should we greet them with sticks of tuberose? The BJP should be careful,” Guha told HT. Bhattacharya also alleged that a BJP office at Jalpaiguri in north Bengal was vandalized. Kisan Kalyani, president of the TMC’s Jalpaiguri district unit denied the allegation. “We have no such information. In the past, BJP workers ransacked their own offices and put the blame on us. Since morning, we have been holding peaceful demonstrations in protest against the attack on Abhishek Banerjee’s car in Tripura,” Kalyani said. North Bengal, especially Cooch Behar district, has been witnessing unrest since the state polls held in March-April. Union minister of state for home affairs, Nisith Pramanik, is the BJP Lok Sabha member from Cooch Behar. Pramanik contested the Dinhata assembly seat and defeated Guha, who was the sitting legislator, by 57 votes. Guha suffered multiple fractures in his right arm and two of his security personnel were injured when they were attacked, allegedly by BJP workers, on May 6. Denying the charge, BJP leaders said the attack was a fallout of infighting in TMC. Assembly polls will be held again in Dinhata as Pramanik resigned from the assembly to retain his Lok Sabha seat. On May 13, governor Jagdeep Dhankhar faced demonstration by TMC workers at Dinhata which he visited to meet alleged victims of post-poll violence despite a strong advisory from chief minister Mamata Banerjee. During the trip, Dhankhar was accompanied by Pramanik and the party’s district unit president Malati Rava Roy. They took the governor to some villages where people alleged that TMC workers attacked them and ransacked their homes after the poll results were announced on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-says-2-workers-killed-in-bengal-after-attack-on-abhishek-banerjee-s-car-101627997371503.html
03-08-2021||India||‘Not decided yet but…’: Goa’s MGP chief confirms alliance talks with AAP||PANAJI: Goa’s Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) has discussed the possibility of a pre-poll alliance with Arvind Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) but the two parties have not taken a decision yet, a senior MGP leader said on Tuesday.MGP chief Sudin Dhavalikar ruled out an alliance with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party or the opposition Congress, insisting that his party will only team up with a “good party”. The AAP appeared to make the cut on this benchmark.“If we do an alliance it will be with a good party. There is no way we will align with either the BJP or the Congress. AAP has discussed this with me... We have not decided anything yet,” former deputy chief minister Dhavalikar told reporters.The lawmaker from Marcaim in north Goa said his party had an invite from AAP to travel to Delhi for further discussions.“They have invited us -- the committee -- to go to Delhi, see the work that they have done and then we can again have a discussion.… I also want to go to Delhi to see that work, and either this month or next I will go to Delhi”.Dhavalikar’s statement after a quiet meeting with AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal during his two-day visit to Goa beginning July 13. Both leaders had then insisted that their meeting was a courtesy visit and they did not discuss a possible alliance between their parties.Notwithstanding the denials, their meeting did spark buzz about a possible alliance. Political analysts say an alliance would make sense since the MGP is strong in areas where the AAP has little or no presence.The Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party was once a powerful regional party that ruled Goa through the 1960s, 70s and 80s giving Goa its first chief minister Bhausaheb Bandodkar. The party has a large vote base among the state’s politically powerful Bahujan Samaj. However, the MGP has been losing ground to the BJP which has grown at its expense, reducing the party to a minor coalition partner.But the MGP nevertheless remained a kingmaker in successive coalition governments led by the BJP and Congress.The AAP, on the other hand, has a visible presence only in constituencies where the Catholic vote holds sway, where the MGP is known to be weak.AAP state convener Rahul Mhambre said that his party was ‘open’ to alliances but for now there was nothing. “We are working to strengthen our party and they are working to strengthen theirs. We are open to alliances,” Mhambre said. Kejriwal’s party contested all 40 seats in the 2017 Goa legislative assembly elections but didn’t win a single seat. To be sure, all its candidates except one lost their security deposit. The lone candidate who secured more than one-sixth of the total votes polled has since moved to the Congress. AAP leaders suggest that an alliance will help them improve their performance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-decided-yet-but-goa-s-mgp-chief-confirms-alliance-talks-with-aap-101627997011157.html
03-08-2021||India||Tribunal Reforms Bill passed in LS as govt, Oppn trade charges||Lok Sabha on Tuesday passed the Tribunal Reforms Bill which seeks to dissolve certain existing appellate bodies amid protests by the Opposition. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman criticised the Opposition for creating a “constitutional impasse” by neither allowing the Bills to pass and nor allowing any discussion on them.“If the Opposition is ready for a discussion… We are also ready to respond...but sadly, instead of taking part in a discussion, they are creating disturbance and not even not taking any steps to stop it,” she said.The Tribunal Reforms Bill, replacing the ordinance issued in April this year, seeks to withdraw and then replace the Cinematograph Act, the Copyright Act, the Customs Act, the Patents Act, the Airport Authority of India Act, the Trade Marks Act, and the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act. The government said this would reduce another layer of litigation by abolishing tribunals or authorities under various laws.Opposition leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said, “This kind of legislation will further an ominous system in our country. This (Bill) is nothing but a serious encroachment upon the judiciary. It violates (judiciary) rights.”However, before Chowdhury could complete his statement, the Speaker appealed to the members to vote on all the clauses of the Bill which were then passed with a voice vote.Reacting to the passing of the Bill, Congress spokesperson and MP Manish Tewari said it was a “daylight murder of democracy”. He said that the Opposition wanted a discussion on said Bill “for it encroaches on the domain of judiciary” but their demand was ignored.“It is the right of every member to ask for a vote. The demand was not heeded and an important legislation was passed in the din,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tribunal-reforms-bill-passed-in-ls-as-govt-oppn-trade-charges-101627996291431.html

The directive from UAE’s National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority (NCEMA) and General Civil Aviation Authority will also apply to citizens of Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nigeria and Uganda. The move will allow UAE residents from these six countries to return, provided 14 days have elapsed since they received the second vaccine dose. The travellers must possess vaccination certificates issued by authorities in their countries. According to latest directive, both vaccinated and unvaccinated travellers from several other categories will also be allowed into the UAE from August 5. Also Read | Philippines extends travel ban on India, 9 other nations due to Delta variantThese categories include health workers such as doctors, nurses and technicians employed in the UAE, those working in the education sector, students, humanitarian cases with valid residency permits, and employees of federal and local government bodies. India has been pushing the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states, including the UAE, to allow Indian professionals and other workers to return to their jobs in West Asia by easing Covid-19 related travel restrictions. Some recent reports had suggested that the UAE could extend the restrictions into August. The UAE alone is home to 3.42 million Indians, one of the largest concentrations of expatriates in West Asia. A large number of doctors and nurses in the UAE are of Indian origin. The UAE had imposed fresh travel restrictions on India and suspended flights following a second wave of Coronavirus infections earlier this year. Other categories of travellers from these six countries will continue to be barred from entering the emirates. Travellers will have to apply online through the website of the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship to get approval. Besides vaccination certificates, the applicants need to submit a negative PCR test result within 48 hours of the date of departure. A lab test will be conducted before they board the planes, and a PCR test will be done on arrival in the UAE. This will be followed by home quarantine. The UAE will also lift a ban on transit passenger traffic from the six countries from August 5. NCEMA said on Twitter that passengers from these countries will be able to transit through UAE airports as long as they present negative PCR tests taken 72 hours before departure. Final destination approval would also have to be provided and UAE departure airports will arrange separate lounges for transiting passengers, NCEMA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uae-to-allow-entry-of-health-workers-from-india-from-august-5-101627995511401.html

The incident, according to a report by geologists from the Uttarakhand Disaster Recovery Initiative (UDRI) submitted to the Chamoli district magistrate in July, destabilised Raini, whose most famous resident to this day remains Gaura Devi, one of the founding members of an environmental movement that started when she and a few other women hugged trees to prevent them from being felled for timber.“The Raini village is facing serious slope stability problems where the whole area is affected by active subsidence whereas downslope is affected by toe erosion. During investigation wide cracks were observed in the walls and floors of many houses indicating active slope movement in the area. It is therefore advisable to rehabilitate Raini village to an alternative safe location,” said the report, a copy of which has been seen by HT.Located at the confluence of the Rishiganga and Dhauliganga rivers, Raini saw wide cracks (5-10cm) on the roads. The report said the high-flow intensity of the flood may have disturbed the slope. On top of the slope face, there is an active slide zone from where large rock chunks continue to fall.During a field visit by the geologists, they observed that the material that forms the slope is highly saturated due to incessant rain. Chamoli district received heavy rain in mid-June that triggered landslides at many places. On June 14, about 40 metres of the road at Raini broke off and was engulfed by the Dhauliganga on the Joshimath-Malari route, cutting off Army and Indo Tibetan Border Police posts and villages along the India-China border.“There are several slope instability-related concerns in Raini following the February 7 glacier breach. It’s up to the government now to take forward our recommendation to rehabilitate the village,” said Manish Semwal, slope stabilisation expert, UDRI.But the villagers aren’t keen on being relocated. “First, the villagers have to agree to relocation and rehabilitation. They haven’t agreed yet. They are looking for suitable government land to relocate. They have to find that land first, have a gram panchayat meeting approving rehabilitation and then send the proposal to state government for us to process it,” said S A Murugesan, secretary, Uttarakhand State Disaster Management Authority.Climate Trends, a Delhi-based communications organisation that is tracking Raini’s case study, said the climate crisis and unplanned development in recent years has made several parts of Uttarakhand extremely vulnerable.Professor Y P Sundriyal, head of department, geology, HNB Garhwal University, said: “Higher Himalayas, both climatically and tectonically, are highly sensitive, so much so, that construction of mega hydro-projects should be avoided. Or else they should be of small capacity. Secondly, the construction of roads should be done with all scientific techniques...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/uttarakhands-raini-village-declared-unstable-and-unsuitable-for-habitation-101627995151451.html

The figure is based on the system operations highlights for July 2021, put out by the Power System Operation Corporation Ltd (POSOCO), the ministry added.This number was 17.6 per cent higher than the country's demand for power in July last year, according to power ministry.The POSOCO report also showed that average energy consumption per day recorded in July this year was 10.6 per cent higher than the figures in July last year.India has been pushing for use of green energy sources, and in this regard, renewable energy sector saw impressive gains in the month of July, the ministry said."Average solar generation recorded in Jul’21 (158MU/day) was 7.6% higher than in Jul’20 (147MU/day). Average wind generation recorded in Jul’21 (349MU/day) was 64.5% higher than in Jul’20 (212MU/day). Additionally, solar and wind generation recorded an all-time high of 43.1 GW on 27th July 2021. Earlier, the record was 41.1 GW on 11th Jun’21," the ministry said in the release.The power consumption had dipped across the country due to lockdowns - both in the first and second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The economic activity was impacted due to lockdowns, which in turn led to fall in energy demand.Power consumption had recorded a 4.6 per cent year-on-year growth in September 2020 and 11.6 per cent in October 2020. In November 2020, the power consumption growth slowed to 3.12 per cent, mainly due to the early onset of winters. In December 2020, power consumption grew by 4.5 per cent while it was up 4.4 per cent in January 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-power-demand-hit-all-time-high-of-200-57-gw-july-7-101627993385999.html

The eight states with a high Reproductive Number value, as highlighted by the ministry, are Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Lakshadweep, Tamil Nadu, Mizoram, Karnataka, Puducherry and Kerala.Also Read: Covid-19 R-value rising steadily in India; Kerala, N-E states tops listAmong these, the number is at its highest in Himachal Pradesh and J&K, where it is at 1.4 for each, followed by 1.3 in Lakshadweep. It is at 1.2 in Tamil Nadu, Mizoram and Karnataka, while the corresponding figure for both Puducherry in Kerala is 1.1. Additionally, nine states have a Reproductive Number value at exactly 1: Delhi, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Goa, Jharkhand, Nagaland and Meghalaya.“Whenever this number is at more than one, this means that the case trajectory is increasing and thus needs to be brought under control,” Lav Agarwal, a joint secretary in the Union health ministry, said at a press briefing on current Covid-19 situation in the country. Agarwal also pointed that, at 1.2, the average figure is same for the United States, Canada, Australia and India. Few days back, India's Reproductive Number was at 0.88, he said.Reproductive Number, which is also known as R-factor or R-value, is the reproductive rate of a virus, in this case SARS-CoV-2. It denotes the speed at which the infection is spreading, or, as Agarwal explained, the number of people to whom the virus was passed by an individual at the time he/she was infected with it. An R-value of more than 1 means an infected individual further infected more than one individual.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8-states-showing-high-reproductive-number-warns-health-ministry-highest-in-himachal-jk-101627991262207.html

Pakistan had planned to take a group of five foreign journalists to Islamabad during August 3-7 for interactions with Prime Minister Imran Khan and other senior leaders and officials. The group included representatives from The New York Times, Reuters and The Economist. The visit by the New Delhi-based journalists was to have been a follow-up to a visit last month by a group of Afghan journalists that interacted with Khan. The visits are part of Pakistan’s overall effort to shape the narrative on Afghanistan and the country’s role in the stalled peace process. Also Read | Speed of Taliban’s assault on key cities exceeds Indian assessmentThe people cited above said on condition of anonymity said the Wagah-Attari border crossing is currently open to very limited categories of travellers, including diplomats and people travelling for essential reasons, because of Covid-19-related restrictions. The Pakistani side had sought permission for the five foreign journalists to travel via Wagah along with Jamil Baitu, the spokesperson of the Pakistan high commission in New Delhi. The Pakistani side had been planning the trip by the New Delhi-based foreign journalists for the past few weeks. Another plan by the Pakistani side to take a group of Indian journalists to Islamabad in March was subsequently dropped. The Wagah-Attari border crossing was closed last year following the Covid-19 outbreak. Pakistan recently increased restrictions on travellers from India after the country was hit by a devastating second wave of infections earlier this year. Both Pakistan and India have imposed restrictions on each other’s journalists in recent years after bilateral ties plunged to an all-time low following the military standoff in the aftermath of the 2019 Pulwama suicide bombing that killed 40 Indian troopers. The attack was blamed on Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed. Pakistan also often denies visas to Indian journalists for reporting assignments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-permission-for-india-based-foreign-journalists-to-travel-via-wagah-101627990111157.html

03-08-2021||India||Farm unions prepare to take on BJP in the political arena||At Jantar Mantar, an 18th century observatory in India’s national Capital, a farmers’ mock parliament is in session, barely a kilometre from India’s imposing Parliament. “Lawmakers” in the mock parliament unanimously sign off on a series of “legislations”, from repealing real-world “anti-farmer laws” and enacting “legal guarantees” for assured farm prices. Protests in New Delhi by farm unions against three agricultural laws enacted by the Modi government last year are full of colourful acts of high symbolism, backed by nearly 200 cultivators from various food-bowl states. Elsewhere in the hinterland, however, farm unions are preparing to doggedly resist agricultural policies of the Narendra Modi-led government. The protests have continued, after they began in November 2020, from Punjab to Haryana and Rajasthan, and most importantly Uttar Pradesh, where assembly elections will be held next year. On the face of it, the farmers have had little success in convincing the government to scrap three laws that provide for freer agricultural markets, allowing big supermarkets and food businesses to directly source produce from farmers. The legislation also permit traders to stock large quantities of food for future sales and lay down a new format for contract farming. Also Read | Farm laws: SAD-BSP MPs give wheat stalks to parliamentarians“Aside from the question of repealing the laws, we are ready to talk on any provision of the laws at any time,” agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar has said twice this month. The Modi government has argued that the laws are important to boost rural investments and farm incomes. Allowing food businesses to stock large quantities, for instance, is aimed at spurring private investors to build spacious, modern silos, according to the government. These changes have riled farmers, who say the new laws will expose them to exploitation by big buyers. They prefer to rely on highly regulated government-backed markets, which are not corruption free, but allow farmers to get assured prices for cereals. These markets are also interlocked, meaning farmers depend on middlemen to not just sell their produce but also for credit to meet cultivation costs, which some studies have shown to be a reason for market inefficiencies. Farmers have demanded a flagship law that will legally guarantee benchmark rates, known as minimum support prices, for all produce, regardless of market conditions. “You will see the impact (of the farmers’ agitation) in elections. Please wait,” Rakesh Tikait, a farm leader representing the Bharatiya Kisan Union outfit, said. Behind the curtains, strategies are being drawn to campaign against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which rules both at the Centre and states such as Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Farmers from both these states are heavily participating in the protests. A core group of farm leaders make up the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella outfit coordinating the protests that are now well-organised in at least five large states: Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab. The first two are ruled by BJP. The SKM’s coordinating committee is the engine of the politically challenging spell of protests. And as elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab approach, it is crafting a campaign especially directed at the BJP. The SKM’s decision-making body comprises regional farm leaders who have their own turfs of influence and have, therefore, been assigned jurisdictions. Tikait is influential in western Uttar Pradesh. He belongs to the Baliyan khap, a dominant clan among the Jat agrarian community in western UP, most of which is made up of sugarcane growers. They voted overwhelmingly for the ruling BJP in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha, and the 2017 assembly elections. Tikait has built a groundswell of support for the agitation by raising local farm issues, such as the problems of pending payment from millers to sugarcane growers, aside from the larger demand of scrapping the farm laws. “We are saying repeal these laws. The government is not listening. We are opposing the BJP because it has brought these laws and is refusing to drop them.” Tikait makes it clear that he will work to defeat the BJP. His organisation has planned at least 100 mahapanchayats, or traditional clan-based rural rallies, in Uttar Pradesh. “Lucknow ko Dilli banayenge (will turn Lucknow into another Delhi,” he said. The rallies could be embarrassing for the BJP for they purport to reveal numbers. “The state government had said they would procure every grain produced by farmers. Uttar Pradesh produced nearly 30 million tonne of wheat this time but the government procured just about 6.5 million tonne, figures till July 26 show,” said Yogendra Yadav, another key farm leader, addressing crowds last week. Such statistics are repeated ad nauseum. The BJP, which won a landslide in the 2017 assembly polls and grabbed 76% of seats in recent local body polls, hopes its policies for farmers will pay off. “The political fallout (of these protests) is not very concerning. Steps taken by the government to improve farm incomes, cash transfers for farmers, linking of markets, building of warehouses, expansion of procurement, funding for agricultural markets known as mandis…all these together will counter any negative fallout,” said Gopal Aggarwal, the BJP’s national spokesperson overseeing economic affairs. Farm leaders like Gurnam Singh Charuni, a linchpin of the agitation, want to openly back candidates and even toyed with the idea of fighting polls with a joint farmers’ party. The SKM has shot down Charuni’s proposals, suspending him twice for breaching a promise to keep the agitation apolitical. But he is too important to let go and so the suspensions each time were for a week. “There are ways to intervene electorally by highlighting farmers’ issues,” said Darshan Pal, a medical doctor who coordinates the protests. Charuni, a firebrand, is credited with expanding the farmers’ agitation into Haryana, before it made its way into camps along Delhi’s borders. “What I have decided is that we will back specific candidates of various parties who will voice only farmers’ issues. That is my Mission Punjab. That should be done in all states,” Charuni said. Punjab faces elections next year. In Rajasthan, one of the key lieutenants of the farm agitation is Amra Ram, who belongs to the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), a left-affiliated organisation. The AIKS wields considerable influence in the Shekhawati belt of Rajasthan, an agriculturally and politically significant belt. “Rajasthan is all clear. No farmer wants the farm laws,” Ram said. However, the BJP spokesperson Aggarwal said his “understanding” from interactions with farmers from states such Karnataka, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh was that “farmers not only support the farm reforms but have also shown commitment to them”. In 2017, a big farmers’ uprising failed to make any dent in the BJP’s fortunes, despite thousands marching into Delhi and sharing stage with key Opposition leaders. The Modi government won handsomely in the national election of 2019. At the time, asked why the farmers’ agitation did not succeed in influencing voting patterns, Yogendra Yadav, a professional psephologist and political analyst before assuming his current role as farm leader, had said: “The issue is farmers don’t vote as farmers. They vote as Brahmins, Muslims, Dalits etc.” Yadav was referring to the well-known pattern of voting along caste and religious lines. “This time it will be different,” Tikait said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-unions-prepare-to-take-on-bjp-in-the-political-arena-101627989752444.html

The former Bihar chief minister and the RJD chief also said that despite the rift within the LJP, Chirag Paswan continues to be the leader of the party.Meanwhile, Chirag Paswan said discussions on possible alliance in Bihar or Uttar Pradesh would be done close to the elections. "I respect his (Lalu's) feelings but my priority is the 'Ashirwad Yatra' and making my organisation strong," Chirag Paswan was quoted as saying.Earlier in the day, Lalu called on Loktantrik Janata Dal leader Sharad Yadav along with his daughter Misa Bharti at his Delhi residence.वरिष्ठ समाजवादी नेता शरद भाई से मुलाक़ात कर स्वास्थ्य लाभ संबंधित जानकारी प्राप्त की।सामाजिक, आर्थिक, शैक्षणिक और राजनीतिक असमानता के विरुद्ध हमारा लंबा संघर्ष रहा है। हम समाजवादियों का संघर्ष ही संस्कार है। सांप्रदायिकता और ग़ैर-बराबरी के ख़िलाफ अंतिम दम तक लड़ाई जारी रहेगी। pic.twitter.com/W93QWwa5wIOn Monday, too, Lalu had met Samajwadi Party (SP) supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav in Delhi where his son, the incumbent SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, was also present. Lalu called his visit to Mulayam Singh Yadav a "courtesy call" to enquire about the health of the ailing former Uttar Pradesh chief minister.Calling Mulayam Singh Yadav country's most-veteran socialist, Lalu took to Twitter from his official handle to post photos from the meeting and write that the country needs equality and socialism as opposed to capitalism and communalism.देश के वरिष्ठतम समाजवादी साथी आदरणीय श्री मुलायम सिंह जी से मुलाकात कर उनका कुशलक्षेम जाना।खेत-खलिहान,ग़ैर-बराबरी, अशिक्षा,किसानों,गरीबों व बेरोजगारों के लिए हमारी सांझी चिंताएँ और लड़ाई है।आज देश को पूंजीवाद और सम्प्रदायवाद नहीं बल्कि लोकसमता एवं समाजवाद की अत्यंत आवश्यकता है। pic.twitter.com/XWA2goMjG8Taking a swipe at JD(U)-BJP coalition government in Bihar, Lalu said his party was close to forming a government in Bihar 2020, but couldn't because it was "cheated and defeated" by "10-15 votes". NDA had secured 125 seats in the assembly while the Mahagathbandhan, a coalition of anti-BJP parties, including RJD, Congress and Left Front parties, won 110. RJD couldn't form the government despite emerging as the single-largest party after securing 75 seats, followed by 74 of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and 43 seats of JD(U). LJP which is part of the NDA coalition at the Centre chose to contest the assembly elections separately and managed to keep it foothold on only one seat in the 243-seat Bihar assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lalu-prasad-triggers-buzz-on-tejashwiyadav-chirag-paswan-alliance-in-bihar-101627986381106.html

The harbour phase of the Malabar naval exercises is scheduled on August 21-24, while the sea phase of the annual exercise will be held on August 25-29.According to South Block sources, US Navy is bringing in no less than three warships including destroyers, maritime reconnaissance aircraft P 8, anti-submarine warfare helicopters and special forces. Indian Navy will be represented by two surface combatants led by Guided Missile Destroyer INS Ranvijay and Frigate INS Shivalik along with maritime reconnaissance aircraft P8I, ASW helicopters and special forces. The Japanese Navy is bringing in three surface combatants, a submarine mine-layer, maritime reconnaissance aircraft, ASW helicopters and special forces. The Australian Navy will participate in Malabar with one ship, ASW helicopter and special forces. The last Malabar exercise off the coast of Guam was held in 2018 with Japanese, Indian and US Navy participating in the advanced naval war games. The Australian Navy joined the Malabar exercises as part of Quad last year.The Quad navies, according to officials, will be interacting with each other during the Malabar exercises with notes being exchanged on how to enforce the rule of law in the Indo-Pacific in wake of an aggressive Chinese Navy. The exercises will involve freedom of navigation operations with the Indian Navy conducting bilateral exercises with Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia and Australian Navy both in South China Sea and the Indo-Pacific.While the Quad exercises are expected to rankle the PLA Navy and Beijing, the Chinese propaganda machine will also be hyperactive by show-casing the DF-26 intermediate range ballistic missile also called the Guam killer in reference to the US Naval base in the far Pacific territory.The Malabar exercises comes just before the much awaited Quad summit in US in which Australian, Japanese and Indian leaders will meet the US President Joe Biden in October. The dates and venue of the Quad summit are being worked out, keeping in mind the Japanese general election in that month.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to attend the G-20 summit in Italy, the COP26 in UK, the UNGA and the Quad summit this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quad-special-forces-to-wargame-off-guam-in-indopacific-101627986615822.html

However, amid the din, Question Hour, which involved questions mostly about farmer welfare, continued without the Opposition’s participation. Speaker Om Birla alleged the Opposition was not interested in the issues of farmers.Addressing the protesting Opposition members who huddled in front of the chair with placards, Birla said, “Today, I took up more than seven issues about farmers in the Parliament. I wanted you to question the (agriculture) minister about their issues in the Question Hour so that their problems would be resolved. But you don’t want to debate or question (the government) about their issues.”He added that the Opposition also had a responsibility to respect the House and maintain decorum. “You have been chosen by the people of this country so that you can voice their issues here (in Parliament) … so that you speak about the issues of farmers. But you (Opposition) are just sloganeering… This is not right,” he said.

The bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh imposed a fine of ₹10,000 on the petitioner, a lawyer.“Nothing in argued by the petitioner concretely on the working of the EVM. We see no reason to entrain the writ petition,” the court said.The judges also said that C R Jaya Sukin, the lawyer, filed a "publicity interest litigation" based on hearsay and "baseless allegations and averments".The lawyer had used four documents in his petition, out of which one was a news item."The petitioner has read the news item the filed the writ petition without looking at the EVM and working of the EVM...which is approved by the Election Commission as well as Parliament," the court said.The court said Sukin may file a fresh petition on the issue after conducting research and making proper averments.“The writ petition is dismissed with costs of ₹10,000 to be deposited in four weeks towards Delhi State Legal Services Authority,” the judges said.Sukin, who appeared in-person, argued that "democracy was in danger" by the use of EVM as the machine was prone to be hacked.The use of EVMs always comes in focus during the time of election and these machines are often slammed by political parties. Many of them have claimed that these EVMs can be hacked to show results in favour of a particular party, a claim dismissed by the Election Commission repeatedly.The commission has though allowed the use of voter-verifiable paper audit trail - short for the commonly used VVPAT - in elections along with EVMs to ensure transparency, it has ruled out reverting to the paper ballot system. It even organised a hackathon in 2017 in a bid to end the raging debate over devices.But in April-May assembly elections in four states and union territory of Puducherry, EVMs were again targeted by the politicians, especially in Bengal. But the EC said that results recorded in EVMs and VVPATs are same.The EVMs were introduced in India in 1982 for a bypoll in Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/publicity-interest-litigation-delhi-high-court-dismisses-plea-against-evms-101627982303217.html
03-08-2021||India||Speed of Taliban’s assault on key cities exceeds Indian assessment||The speed of the Taliban’s assault on key cities in Afghanistan has exceeded an Indian assessment, with hundreds of fighters of the group engaging Afghan forces over the past week in a bid to capture provincial capitals such as Herat and Lashkargah. According to the Indian assessment done last month, officials were expecting the Taliban to expand its sustained campaign of violence from rural areas to urban centres and provincial capitals by the end of August, when the US is set to complete the drawdown of its troops in Afghanistan. The Indian side had also expected the Taliban to step up its offensive in more provinces by the end of the month, including Paktia, Ghazni, Helmand and Kandahar, the southern province which is of symbolic and historic importance to the group because it served as the Taliban headquarters in the 1990s. Also Read | Afghan forces fight Taliban in Lashkargah, clashes intensify in HeratHowever, the Taliban began its assault on Herat, the third-largest Afghan city and capital of the western province of the same name, and Lashkargah, capital of the key southwestern province of Helmand, late last month – much earlier than the Indian assessment, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. These attacks follow the Taliban’s campaign to capture a swathe of rural areas in order to strengthen its position before any possible negotiations, and to gain control of international border crossings with Iran, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Pakistan to maximise the collection of funds by extorting money from exporters. Clashes began around Herat – located some 100km from the Islam Qala border crossing with Iran – almost a week ago and Afghan forces in the city have been bolstered by support from local militias and 75-year-old warlord Ismail Khan, whose group had fought alongside American forces to topple the Taliban in 2001. “If Herat doesn’t fall, this might become a turning point in the Afghan war,” Avinash Paliwal, associate professor in the department of politics and international studies at SOAS University, who closely tracks developments in Afghanistan, said in a tweet. The situation in Lashkargah is more serious, with media reports stating that the Taliban had made inroads into the western city. Tolo News channel cited local residents as saying on Tuesday that heavy fighting had been going on since last night close to the city’s police headquarters, the provincial governor’s compound, the office of the National Directorate of Security (NDS) or the spy agency and a prison in the capital of Helmand province. The local residents also said all other areas of Lashkargah are under the control of the Taliban and that air strikes were being carried out in many parts of the city. The people cited above said air support will be crucial to efforts by Afghan security forces to push back the Taliban offensive in many key areas, both in terms of air strikes on the Taliban and for logistics, supplies and casualty evacuation. Such support is also crucial in view of the backing for the Taliban from the Pakistani side, the people added. “The supply lines from the Pakistani side remain open. Funds are being raised in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa for the Taliban and madrasses in these provinces are calling on people to join the jihad in Afghanistan,” said one of the people cited above. “All forms of logistical and tactical support from the Pakistani side are still active,” the person added. Numerous videos and images have also emerged in social media in recent weeks about injured Taliban fighters being brought for treatment to Pakistani cities such as Peshawar, Chaman and Quetta and of funerals being held for Pakistani fighters killed on Afghan soil. The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) has documented extra-judicial killings in areas captured by the Taliban, such as Spin Boldak, a border crossing with Pakistan. Following the emergence of videos of Taliban fighters summarily executing pro-government civilians in Spin Boldak after capturing the district on July 14, AIHRC investigated the incidents and interviewed families of victims and witnesses. “The evidence indicates that the Taliban, in violation of international humanitarian law, committed retaliatory killings of civilians and looted the property of several local residents, including the properties related to former and current government officials,” AIHRC said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/speed-of-taliban-s-assault-on-key-cities-exceeds-indian-assessment-101627982430863.html

"Almost 47crore doses have been administered so far. In August, availability should increase significantly overall and it is expected that Bharat Biotech will be able to provide seven to 10 crore doses per month in the coming weeks," he said."Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute are our major vaccine suppliers and we hope they will drive our mission to complete the adult immunisation programme in this country by the end," he added.Regarding the present status of vaccine supplies, he said, "Serum Institute produced almost 8- 10 crore doses, 3-3.5 crore from Bharat Biotech and a small contribution from (Russia-made) Sputnik V."Dr Arora also expressed hope that ZyCoV-D, being manufactured by Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila, will be available soon.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quality-concerns-delayed-covaxin-supply-says-top-govt-advisor-101627979351809.html

Speaking with beneficiaries of Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PM-GKAY) in Gujarat via video conferencing, Modi said free ration is being distributed to lakhs of families under the scheme and it has helped lessen the worries of poor during pandemic. "I'm satisfied that your family's ration problem is solved now," he told a beneficiary.An official release from the Prime Minister's Office said a public participation programme is being launched in Gujarat to create further awareness about the scheme.The PM said since Independence, almost every government talked about providing cheap food to the poor. "The reach of cheap ration schemes and budget increased during these years, but the effect remained limited. Food storage kept increasing, but starvation and malnutrition did not decrease in that ratio," Modi said. One of the main reasons behind this was the lack of effective delivery system. To change this situation afresh work was started after 2014. Crores of fake beneficiaries were removed from the system. Aadhaar was linked to ration card and digital technology was endorsed in government ration shops," he said, adding the new scheme ensures nobody sleeps on empty stomach even during the pandemic."Today, in addition to the quota of wheat at ₹2 per kg and rice at ₹3 per kg, 5 kg of wheat and rice is being given free to every beneficiary. This scheme is going to last till Diwali. In Gujarat, around 3.5 crore people are benefitting from this scheme," Modi said.Modi said empowerment of the poor is a top priority of his government. "Today, the country is spending lakhs of crores on infrastructure, but at the same time, it is also setting new benchmarks to improve the quality of life of the common man,” he said.The PM-GKAY is a food security welfare scheme that was envisaged by the PM to provide assistance and help mitigate the economic impact of Covid-19.Under the yojana, additional foodgrain of 5 kg per person is given to all beneficiaries covered under the National Food Security Act.Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani addressed the beneficiaries before the PM interacted with them.

Some $2 trillion will be spent on infrastructure in just the next decade,” he said. "The bulk of the infrastructure needed for 2030 is yet to be built. That's why some 100 new airports are under planning or construction today alone," he added.He told students that India has the youngest workforce in Asia. “…and you'll hold that advantage until 2050. That's pretty formidable,” he said.Also read | US announces additional $25 million to support India's vaccination programVerma, who was the first-ever Indian American envoy to India, said the modern US-India relationship was quite young. “We mark the start of this era with President Clinton's visit to India in the year 2000. It was a breakthrough visit after decades of being somewhat distant, and even at times, estranged,” he said.Verma asserted that it was now time for the relationship between India and the United States to deliver. “We can no longer look decades into the future. The time to deliver results for our people is now – it's today – that's a big challenge, but it's also exciting, for us here in America, and for all of you in India, especially as you start out on your studies and then careers,” he said.Also read | India, US should stand together as threats to democracy, freedom rise: BlinkenThe former US envoy said the ties between India and his country is the "most consequential relationship of this century." "We can do so much together. Whether it's battling a pandemic, countering terrorism and proliferation, or bringing to market all those new innovations and solutions that will make people's lives easier, safer, greener, more prosperous, more inclusive and more secure,” he explained. "We can do that. We are not there yet, but can we get there."Richard Verma's comments came days after US secretary of state Antony Blinken said during his visit to the country last month that there are few relationships more vital than the one between India and the United States. Blinken also said the two countries should continue to stand together as leading democracies amid rising global threats to democracy and international freedoms.He told the students that they will have "the world at your fingertips". “Your country will have a leading seat in international institutions, your businesses will continue to power economic growth and innovations globally, and all of you can choose what role you want to play today and in the future.”Richard Verma, a lawyer, served as the US ambassador to India from 2014 to 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exus-envoy-says-india-may-lead-the-world-by-2030-lists-areas-101627968009671.html
03-08-2021||India||Monsoon Session: Here are some of the Bills passed without discussion||In the current monsoon session of Parliament, the Opposition has accused the NDA government of “bulldozing” Bills by denying them their “legitimate right” of discussion.Here are some of the Bills that have been passed without much discussion in Parliament in the recent past:Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Amendment Bill, 2021: Cleared in this session, the Juvenile Justice Amendment Bill provides district and additional district magistrates the power to issue adoption orders and examine the work of various child welfare authorities, including the child welfare committee and district child protection unit. It also categorises many undefined crimes where no minimum sentence was prescribed.Factoring Amendment Bill, 2021: The Bill was passed in just 15 minutes after it was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on July 28. It aims to aid the MSME (micro, small and medium enterprises) sector and was scheduled to be taken up a week ago as well but could not because of Opposition protests over the alleged targeting of politicians, journalists, and constitutional authorities by Israeli spyware Pegasus.Click here for LIVE Updates of Parliament session todayThe General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Amendment Bill, 2021: On Monday, Lok Sabha passed the Bill which will allow the government to reduce its share in the state-owned general insurance companies, helping achieve its divestment targets. Divestment refers to the government’s selling of part of its ownership in state-run corporations.While the government said it would generate income, the Opposition had protested against it, saying the Bill is “anti-people”.Tribunal Reforms Bill, 2021: The Bill was cleared by Lok Sabha on August 2 without a discussion even when the Opposition specifically asked the government for one. The Bill seeks to abolish tribunals or authorities under various laws by amending various statutes to streamline the justice delivery system. These include the Cinematograph Act, the Copyright Act, the Customs Act, the Patents Act, the Airport Authority of India Act, the Trade Marks Act and the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act.The government said it believes many tribunals only add to another additional layer of litigation.“By riding over the legitimate right of the Opposition, the government has been bulldozing one after another legislation without a discussion… There has been no enlistment of this Bill… by the BAC (business advisory committee),” Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said while opposing the Bill.Trinamool MP Derek O’Brien tweeted, “In the first 10 days, Modi-Shah rushed through and passed 12 Bills at an average time of UNDER SEVEN MINUTES per Bill.

03-08-2021||India||Covid-19 norms flouted amid rush at UP temple||Over a hundred thousand devotees thronged Varanasi’s Kashi Vishwanath temple to take a holy dip in the Ganga river on the second Monday of ‘Sawan’ month, ignoring warnings issued by authorities to adhere to the Covid-19 guidelines. Most visitors were seen walking without face masks or maintaining social distance.“Baba Bholenath takes care of one and all. His devotees are safe. Corona is nothing in front of the power of Baba Bholenath,” said Raju Rai, one of the devotees, as he joined loud chants of “Har Har Mahadev” heading to take a dip in Ganga. Prasad Dikshit, a priest, expressed a similar sentiment. “Baba will take care of all,” he said.A senior official of the temple administration assured that adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour is a priority. “It is being ensured that the devotees maintain physical distance in the temple premises,” said chief executive officer of the temple, Sunil Kumar Verma.A devotee, however, said: “The crowd was so huge that it was virtually difficult to maintain social distance as queues stretched for nearly two kilometres.”The month-long celebration of Sawan, also known as Sharvan, is dedicated to Shiva and Monday is considered as the most auspicious day for worshipping Lord Shiva.As per tradition, devotees collect gangajal (Ganga water) from the river and walk to the temple to offer the water to the deity.Many devotees take a holy dip in the Ganga and collect Gangajal in pitchers and then go to the temple.This year, owing to Covid-19, the annual kanwar yatra, which is usually carried out in the month of Sawan, has also been cancelled amid warnings over a possible third wave.“We have appealed to the people several times to wear masks, follow physical distance and avoid visiting crowded places,” said Varanasi’s chief medical officer Dr VB Singh.Till Monday, Uttar Pradesh’s tally of Covid-19 cases reached 1,708,500, with 24 new cases. Of these, Varanasi reported two.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-norms-flouted-amid-rush-at-up-temple-101627936793941.html
03-08-2021||India||30 Covid hospitals put on notice over fire safety certificate, Gujarat to SC||NEW DELHI: The Gujarat government told the Supreme Court on Monday that 30 out of 328 Covid-19 hospitals in the state have been issued notices to comply with fire safety measures while the remaining 298 have a valid no objection certificate (NOC) from the fire department.Gujarat, which witnessed two major fire incidents at Covid hospitals last year. faced scrutiny by the Supreme Court which noticed that a July 8 notification by the government permitted the state’s hospitals to acquire building use (BU) permission by March 2022. On July 19, the court asked the government to explain if its notification violated a Supreme Court order of December 18, 2020 ordering mandatory fire safety audit for hospitals across the country.A fire at Shrey hospital in Ahmedabad killed eight people while another at Uday Shivanand hospital in Rajkot left five people dead.In its affidavit, the Gujarat government said its July 8 notification extending the deadline for compliance with BU permission did not grant any extended time limit for hospitals to obtain a valid fire safety certificate. “While Fire Safety Certificate is one of the necessary pre-requisite for grant of BU Permission, there is no requirement of BU Permission for granting the Fire Safety Certificate,” the affidavit said. To make this point clear, the state said it issued a clarificatory notification on July 23 to this effect.As on date, Gujarat said that out of 328 hospitals serving as Covid hospitals, 298 have a valid Fire NOC. Pursuant to the fire audit ordered by the top court in December 2020, the state said that out of 5,705 hospitals in the state, 4,604 possess valid Fire NOC under the Gujarat Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act, 2013.“All the requirements of fire safety norms related to fire systems and provisions for equipment related to fire safety or any building in the state, are mandatory and must be complied with. The authorities competent to take action under Gujarat Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act, 2013 shall continue to take all actions, including coercive actions, in case of non-compliance,” the state added, citing its July 23 notification.But the Gujarat government did itself in trouble over its new notification.The bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah said: “How can the government say by issuing a notification that provisions of law will not apply. The BU permission is under the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act, 1976. You cannot stay the provisions under the Town Planning Act.”The court wondered who advised Gujarat to issue its July 23 order which categorically suggested that the July 8 notification applied only to BU permission and not fire clearance. The bench, which posted the matter after a week, asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta to advise the state on this issue.On July 19, the court while dealing with a suo moto petition on the issue of proper treatment to Covid-19 patients and dignified handling of dead bodies had remarked: “Hospitals have become a large industry. They survive on human distress. They cannot be protected at the cost of citizens whom they are meant to subserve.” The July 8 notification was seen as an attempt by the state government to provide a long rope to hospitals. On the previous day, the court had even directed the state to supply a copy of the report prepared by Justice DA Mehta Committee, which gave suggestions following the two fire incidents at Covid hospitals. The report was presented to the court on Monday in a sealed cover.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/30-covid-hospitals-put-on-notice-over-fire-safety-certificate-gujarat-to-sc-101627934728410.html
03-08-2021||India||‘Ball in Centre’s court’: NSCN-IM on eve of anniversary of Framework Agreement||KOHIMA: On the eve of the sixth anniversary of the Framework Agreement signed between the Union government and the Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN I-M) on August 3, 2015, to resolve the protracted Naga political issue, the NSCN (IM) has called upon the Centre to execute the agreement with “all honesty” and not resort to misinterpretation to suit its convenience.In a statement on Monday, the Naga armed group said the framework agreement was entering six years without any follow-up action by the Centre to concretize the agreement into a solid official document as a transitional arrangement for the final settlement of the Naga political issue.“Six years waiting is a long period in any sense of the term. Given the complexity of the issue, Naga people are, however, patient enough waiting for GoI (government of India) to act upon its own commitment. The ball is, therefore, with the court of the Government of India, and not with the NSCN,” the statement said.The outfit, which has been in a ceasefire agreement with the government since 1997, maintained that the framework agreement was the fruition of gruelling rounds of discussions to set the “Indo-Naga political talks” on firm footing to take the Naga peace process to an honourable and acceptable conclusion for both parties.“It was after more than ten years of negotiation following the official recognition of the unique history and situation of the Nagas when the talks reached deadlock-like situation with no side willing to compromise as both the Indian and Naga leaders took their respective parallel stands never to meet whatsoever. The stand of the GoI was – ‘solution within the parameter of the Indian Constitution and Union of India’, whereas the stand of the Nagas was-‘nothing to do with India, nothing short of total independence and total sovereignty. Finally, after a long series of talks, the Government of India proposed the Framework Agreement as a formula of win-win solution (sic),” the NSCN (IM) statement said.The statement pointed out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is now being carefully watched if he would live up to his “high profile Framework Agreement speech” where he is said to have mentioned that the Nagas and the people of India have continued to look at each other through the prism of false perception and old prejudices, but the signing of the Framework Agreement was a shining example of what can be achieved when both parties dealt with each other in a spirit of equality and respect, trust and confidence and leave the path of the dispute to take the high road of dialogue.The group maintained that in order to find a “lasting Naga solution”, the Centre will have to look through the prism of the Framework Agreement and no other way.“Prime Minister Modi had shown his confidence and pride in signing the FA that he made it sure that the signing ceremony is live-telecast to make the whole world witness the historic agreement. He even generated much amusement among the opposition parties when he informed them that he had solved the longest-running insurgency movement in Southeast Asia by the stroke of a pen signing the Framework Agreement,” the NSCN (IM) stated while underscoring that PM Modi should appoint his representatives to take the agreement to a logical conclusion.“There is no point talking with the officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), GoI as the informal talk is leading to nowhere other than beating around the bush,” it asserted.“It is our conviction that only the principle of the Framework Agreement is the key to an honourable and acceptable solution for durable peace. Neither economic packages nor imposed political packages will bring about a lasting solution. There are no other tangible options we can conceive,” the statement further said.The delay in signing the final pact to seal the Naga peace process under the aegis of the Framework Agreement was widely attributed to the NSCN (IM)’s resolute demand for a separate Naga flag and constitution (Yehzabo), which, the outfit holds strongly that they represented the unique history and political identity of the Nagas.“Without the Naga national flag and Yehzabo, everything discussed and agreed upon shall be nullified,” it stated.The NSCN (IM) has also announced protests against the Centre “for keeping silent” on the Framework Agreement, by calling for a total closure of shops and business establishments in Nagalim (all Naga inhabited areas) for 12 hours on August 3 till noon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ball-in-centre-s-court-nscn-im-on-eve-of-anniversary-of-framework-agreement-101627933828170.html
03-08-2021||India||2.5 lakh people rescued as flood-like situation hits six districts of Bengal||Nearly 2.5 lakh people had to be rescued and relief material had to be rushed as a flood-like situation hit six districts in south Bengal due to heavy rainfall in the state and its neighbouring areas and release of water from barrages and dams. A top official of the West Bengal government said that Indian Air Force choppers had to be deployed at Khanakul in Hooghly district to rescue people. At Khanakul in Hooghly a 101-year-old woman was rescued and taken to a relief shelter. A low pressure, which triggered heavy rainfall in south Bengal last week moved in the northwest direction across Jharkhand and southern parts of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh triggering rain in the adjoining districts, said a senior official of the India Meteorological Department’s regional weather forecasting centre (RWFC) in Kolkata. This prompted the Damodar Valley Corporation to release a huge amount of water from the barrages over the past few days. The water, flowing down the rivers, flooded multiple areas such as Udanarayanpur in Howrah, Khanakul in Hooghly and Ghatal in West Midnapore. “We have shifted around 2.5 lakh people to rescue shelters in Hooghly, Howrah, Purba Bardhaman, Paschim Bardhaman, Paschim Medinipur, and South 24 Parganas districts. Over one lakh tarpaulin, around 1,000 MT of rice, thousands of drinking water pouches and clothes have been sent to the rescue shelters,” a senior official said. Javed Ahmed Khan, disaster management minister and Dushyant Nariala, secretary of disaster management and civil defence could not be reached despite repeated attempts. State panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee visited some of the flood-hit areas of Ghatal in Paschim Medinipur to take stock of the situation. “Some places have been completely inundated and thousands of people have been stranded. The chief minister has asked me to look into the matter. After conducting this survey, I will report to her,” he said. A DVC official said that water was last discharged from its dams on July 31. The corporation had 1.14 lakh cusec of water on Saturday, he said. “We haven’t yet estimated the loss incurred due to the flood. As of now, our sole priority is to rescue the affected,” the official underlined. “Due to extremely heavy rainfall on July 30 and 31 at DVC area and in the upper reaches in Jharkhand and release of huge amount of water from the Tenughat dam by the Jharkhand government, DVC had to release up to 1.14 lakh cusecs on Saturday. This has now been brought down to 80,000 cusecs. The West Bengal government was informed beforehand that DVC would be releasing water from Maithon and Panchet dams,” said a senior official of DVC. Water from several rivers, including Rupnarayan, Dwarakeswar, Shilabati rivers have overtopped banks and entered residential areas, flooding homes in districts. At Khanakul IAH choppers rescued around 27 people who were stranded. At Ghatal, there were multiple breaches in the embankments of River Shilabati. The river water inundated several villages and the municipal area too. People had to take shelter in the first floor of two-storey houses. At Udanarayanpur in Howrah at more than 40 villages were hit by water of the River Damodar. The water entered the villages through breaches in the embankments. At least 80 villages were inundated. There was knee-deep water at the campus of the state general hospital in Howrah. At Kalimpong in north Bengal, three people, who were swept away on Friday when the water level in the River Mam Khola rose due to heavy rains, could not be traced even on Monday.

03-08-2021||India||Odisha’s Naveen Patnaik, hockey and the legacy that he could be building||Bhubaneswar: Moments after the Indian women’s hockey team beat the much-fancied Australians in Tokyo Olympics’ quarter-final on Monday morning, 74-year-old Naveen Patnaik stood on the verandah of his official residence Naveen Niwas in Bhubaneswar to record a congratulatory video message for the Indian eves.“What a terrific game by our women’s hockey team against Australia,” said Patnaik, wearing a black tee and pyjama. The previous evening, Patnaik was seen standing and clapping for the Indian men’s team that beat Great Britain to enter an Olympics semifinal after a gap of 49 years.It was a game that Patnaik helped when not many others came forward. Like when Sahara backed out from sponsoring the Indian hockey teams in 2018, the Odisha government signed a ₹100 crore deal with Hockey India to sponsor the men’s and women’s hockey teams over the next 5 years. Describing the 5-year sponsorship deal as Odisha’s gift to the nation, Patnaik then described the game as a way of life in his state’s tribal region “where children learn to walk with hockey sticks”.There was recognition on and off social media for the critical support his government extended to the game that he once played as a member of the Doon school hockey team. He was then the goalie.India dominated the world hockey scene as hockey wizard Dhyan Chand led the national team to three successive Olympic gold medals in 1928, 1932 and 1936. But after the defeat in the 1980 Moscow Olympic finals, the game lost much of its popularity in India. Odisha helped give the game a much-needed push starting with the Champions Trophy hockey tournament in 2014.In 2017, his government also sponsored Kalinga Lancers club that won the Hockey India League in January and followed up by hosting Hockey World League in December 2018 when Bhubaneswar’s Kalinga Stadium hosted World Cup Men’s Hockey tournament. The following year, Odisha hosted FIH Men’s Series Finals and Olympic Hockey Qualifiers 2019 and even the FIH Pro League in 2020. India is set to host the 2023 edition of the FIH Men’s Hockey World Cup, after successfully organising it in 2018.In 2023, Bhubaneswar and Rourkela will again host the World Cup Hockey for Men for the second time. In Rourkela of Sundargarh district, Patnaik government is building the country’s biggest hockey stadium with a seating capacity for 20,000 spectators that will be named after tribal leader Birsa Munda. To further strengthen the hockey ecosystem in Sundargarh, Odisha is also planning to lay a synthetic hockey turf in each of the 17 blocks of the district.“Odisha is the sports capital of India thanks to the vision of Naveen Patnaik,” said Odisha sports minister Tusharkanti Behera. “It’s not just hockey, but our government is patronising many other sports disciplines starting from rugby to football.”Just before the pandemic hit India last year, the first-ever Khelo India University Games was held in Odisha in which 4,000 athletes from 176 universities participated in 211 events in 17 sports events over a period of 10 days. In 2019, the state government tied up with Olympian gold medallist Abhinav Bindra to start a Targeting Performance Centre at the Kalinga Stadium complex. The centre’s services would include performance enhancement, injury prevention and management, biomechanics, physiology testing and training, recovery as well as strength and conditioning training.In his home district of Ganjam, Patnaik is setting up an integrated sports complex that would have a synthetic athletic track, multi-purpose indoor hall, aquatic complex, basketball and volleyball courts, yoga hall, medical room and a 150-bed sports hostel, with a proposed expenditure of ₹43 crore. In November last year, his assembly constituency of Hinjili got a 500-seating capacity centrally air-conditioned stadium.Rishabh Jaiswal, who runs Sporting Ethos, a sports science and medicine institute in New Delhi, said Odisha’s government’s sponsorship of games including hockey was a key element in creating a healthy sports ecosystem in the country.“Odisha government deserves a lot of credit for the rise of an Indian hockey team over last 5 years. The Naveen Patnaik government’s public-private partnership for sports is a model for all states to follow,” said Jaiswal.Some believe that Naveen Patnaik generous support may be an effort to create a legacy for the politician who has ruled Odisha for 21 years on the trot. To be sure, his father Biju Patnaik is credited as one of the makers of modern Odisha for delivering signpost projects such as Paradip port, Rourkela Steel plant, Hirakud dam and Bhubaneswar airport.“Naveen perhaps wants to leave a legacy through sports and erase the image of Odisha as a state that is known for its poverty or punching bags of natural disasters,” said Gyana Ranjan swain, a political science professor. Incidentally, he was the first CM in Odisha to have made a hockey player a Rajya Sabha MP.Of course, Patnaik won’t be the first to use sports to make a political statement. In 1995, Nelson Mandela used the Rugby world cup to get South Africa out of the isolation of world sports. The celebration of the Olympic Games in Greek city-states was an occasion for the rulers to discuss important political issues and form political and military alliances. While the Olympic games of 1964 sought to present a new, pacific Japan to the world, South Korea in 1988, China in 2008 and Brazil in 2016 have used the Olympics to mark their emergence on the world stage.Back home, Patnaik’s critics agree that his decision to support hockey made a world of a difference. “He has given hockey a new lease of life through sponsorship and raised the profile of the state in the process. I only wish the money could be spent more on grassroots,” said Prasad Harichandan, former Odisha Congress president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odishas-naveen-patnaik-hockey-and-the-legacy-that-he-could-be-building-101627931849033.html
03-08-2021||India||Chennai civic body to set up park dedicated to covid victims||Chennai: The Chennai civic body is planning to set up a memorial park for Covid-19 victims in the city, where families will plant saplings in memory of their loved ones who succumbed to the coronavirus, officials said. For the proposed park, the Greater Chennai Corporation has selected a 3-acre empty space under a flyover which turned into a dumping ground. Officials are also planning to have an obelisk in the park for engraving names of the Covid victims. “The idea is yet to be approved but the saplings could be provided from government nurseries and each family could be given a unique number; in future they could also add their names to the trees,” said a senior civic official. Besides being an initiative that’s a reminder for the generations to come on how Chennai, the Covid-19 hot pot in Tamil Nadu, fought the pandemic, the park is being planned to offer comfort to those who are living with the loss and to honour communities coming together to help one another during the crisis. Several countries are planting native trees as a memorial to remember people whose lives were cut short abruptly due to Covid-19. Since the virus outbreak in March 2020, as many as 8,318 people have lost their lives in Chennai, the highest among all districts in Tamil Nadu. The state death toll is 34,102 as of August 1, according to the health department data. The proposed site is under Mint flyover in Royapuram, the northern region of Chennai. During the first wave, the Covid-19 caseload was the highest in north Chennai, which is densely populated. Chennai corporation commissioner Gangandeep Singh Bedi and regional deputy commissioner (North) D Sneha inspected the site last week. “The components of the Covid memorial park are being discussed and we are coordinating the work between the headquarters and the region (north),” said Sneha. “We have cleared the garbage and debris in anticipation that work will begin soon.” A budget estimate of ₹5 crore has been prepared for the memorial park. One of Chennai’s oldest civic movements, Exnora International, which has spearheaded tree plantation drives in the city, is for the idea of planting tree saplings. “The trees would be a living memory to Covid-19. Planting saplings also connects people to trees which are being felled everywhere,” said MB Nirmal, founder of Exnora. “Usually, VVIPs plant saplings and it’s good to pass on the ownership to people, so they can take care of these trees.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chennai-civic-body-to-set-up-park-dedicated-to-covid-victims-101627931547366.html

When 835 samples were collected from the least affected to worst-affected areas randomly, the Delta variant was found in 735 samples, said the study jointly conducted by the Institute of Genomic and Integrative Biology (IGIB), Delhi and the state health ministry. Samples were collected from almost all districts and the variant was detected widely in Ernakulam, Kozhikode and Malappuram districts. Except Wayanad, all other districts have shown an alarming presence of the variant in May end and June, it said. Malappuram still topped the pandemic chart in the country with over 3,500 daily average cases. The study shows-- in March, the less contagious Alpha variant was widely prevalent in many districts but later the Delta variant took its place aggravating the situation. Dr Vinod Sacria, principal scientist at the (IGIB), said findings of the new study point to the need of intensifying virus-control measures and surveillance in the state. Three variants-- Alpha, Kappa and Delta-- have been detected in the state and the presence of the highly-contagious last variant is a cause for concern, the study pointed out. Another study conducted by the health department with the help of the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology also found that the Delta variant is dominating in the state. It also found in areas where the Delta variant dominates other variants were not found abundantly. “All studies point to the increased presence of the Delta variant. The next three weeks are crucial for the state,” said state health minister Veena George. Kerala reported 13,984 cases on Monday with a test positivity rate of 10.93% tests were low (1,27, 903) due to weekend closure. It also clocked 118 deaths taking the total fatality to 16,955, according to the statistics released by the health ministry. The active caseload currently stands at 1,65,332. For almost a week, the state has been reporting nearly half of the total cases found in the country. The central team visiting the state met top officials of the health ministry on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-variant-detected-in-90-of-samples-in-kerala-reveals-genome-study-101627931371264.html

The court directed the chief judicial magistrate of Villupuram to conduct the trial on a day-to-day basis. Justice Anand Venkatesh passed the orders in the suo moto writ petition he initiated on March 1.The alleged sexual harassment took place on February 21, when the woman IPS officer was travelling in the car of the special DGP of Tamil Nadu while they were on duty for former chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami’s tour. The superintendent of Chengalpattu was accused of colluding with the main accused and for using the police force to prevent the victim from entering Chennai to file the complaint. Both officers were suspended. On February 27, the CBCID in Villupuram district registered an FIR against the special DGP on several charges under the Indian Penal Code and the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act, 2020. Later, an FIR was also registered against the Chengalpattu SP. The Internal Complaints Committee submitted its preliminary report to the government. “Ultimately, in a case of this nature, the criminal proceedings must reach its logical conclusion at the earliest possible time by holding proceedings on a day-to-day basis,” the court said in its orders. “The effectiveness of the criminal justice system largely depends upon the completion of the proceedings at the earliest and certainty of either punishment or acquittal, as the case may be, of the accused persons.” The court also ordered for a compliance report to be filed on December 23. In case the Villupuram magistrate requires an extension of time, a memo could be filed before the high court for its consideration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-sets-deadline-to-complete-the-trial-in-ips-officer-s-sexual-harassment-case-101627931370153.html
03-08-2021||India||Amid stir, Lakshadweep floats bids on ecotourism||Thiruvananthapuram: Despite protests over new regulations and concerns expressed by many scientists, the Lakshadweep administration has floated global tenders for developing ecotourism projects and water villas in Minicoy, Suheli and Kadmat islands. The global tender was issued on July 31. The Save Lakshadweep Forum, comprising political parties and others opposing new regulations, has decided to step up its protests against the move. The administration on Sunday issued a statement, saying that three premium water villa projects were identified in three islands and the last date of application is September 2. It said a survey by the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management and Niti Aayog has cleared the projects. “Scientific approach adopted in each stage of the project will strike a clear balance between protection of fragile ecosystem of corals and need to improve livelihood opportunities of islanders,” said a statement from the collector’s office. It also said all mandatory clearances, including costal regulation zone norms and environment impact assessment report, are in final stages and all stakeholders will be taken into confidence. Lakshadweep MP Mohammad Faisal, who has been opposing the regulations, said people are not against development but it should be executed with proper environmental clearance after clearing doubts and apprehensions of local people. “We are against crass commercial development in the fragile group of islands. Many scientists have warned that rising sea level triggered by global warming may destabilise permanent structures and affect marine biology,” said UCK Thangal, a leader of the Save Lakshadweep Forum. Earlier, a group of civil servants and many scientists, including herpetologist Romulus Whitaker, have written to President Ramanth Kovind, urging him to withdraw the draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation (2021) that seeks to develop the island as a major tour destination undermining the region’s unique geography and ecology. For more than three months, residents of the archipelago have been protesting against three draft regulations brought in by new administrator Praful Khoda Patel, saying they will affect the unique culture and tradition of the island. People are opposing the move to make the island a tourist destination, ban on cattle slaughter, two-child norm for local body members, liquor licence, goonda law and other new rules. But BJP leaders from the island said some vested interests were stoking fire and provoking local people to stall the developmental projects in the island. Earlier, the Kerala high court had stayed some of the new regulations, including demolition of houses and structures situated close to the sea. Many pleas are pending in the high court now. The local administration also slapped a sedition case against filmmaker and activist Aisha Sultana. She landed in trouble after she made a remark in a TV panel discussion in early June that the union government’s decision to relax Covid-19 restrictions and appointment of new administrator Patel were a bio-weapon against the people of the archipelago. On June 11, Kavaratti police registered a case against her under sections 124 (A) (sedition) and 153 (B) (acts against national interests) of the Indian Penal Code. The case was based on the complaint of Lakshadweep BJP president C Abdul Khadar Haji who said her words were in bad taste and hurt many. Though Sulatana later expressed regrets and withdrew her words, the union government took a strong position saying that her words were used widely by foreign media to portray the country in bad light. The Kerala high court had granted anticipatory bail to her but it refused to quash the case against her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-stir-lakshadweep-floats-bids-on-ecotourism-101627931368392.html

According to the data released from the state health ministry, in at least four Kerala districts, the reproduction number (R value) is above 1.2%. R value is an indicator on how quickly the infection is spreading and gives a clear picture on how many people on an average get infected from a Covid-19 patient. “The latest sero survey shows at least 50% of the population is vulnerable,” said George.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-variant-found-in-90-samples-in-kerala-study-101627931367893.html

But, imagine constructing such architectural marvels with the most basic tools, such as a knife, chisel, hammer, jaggery and tree bark, and using an elephant as your crane.That, in a nutshell, is how the stunning Kakatiya Rudreswara Temple, popularly known as the Ramappa temple, was sculpted way back in the 13th century. It’s no wonder that the 800-year-old monument in Telangana has now been inscribed as a Unesco World Heritage Site, the 39th in India.According to Unesco (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), a monument gets recognised as a heritage site when it has an “outstanding universal value and represents a masterpiece of human creative genius.” The temple is located in Palampet village in Mulugu district, which is about 230 kms away from Hyderabad. Even its builder, Recherla Rudrayya, acknowledged it and had a warning inscribed on the temple itself for his foes. “I can be an enemy to anyone. But, not this temple. Do not destroy it,” it said.Views on some unique featuresSand-box technology: This is one of the key reasons why the temple got the heritage tag. A general of Kakatiya dynasty, Recharla Senapati Rudrayya had commissioned the temple and famous sculptor Ramappa was its chief architect. It took 40 years (1173 to 1213 AD) for Ramappa to complete the construction. The temple stands majestically on a six-foot-high, star-shaped platform which was constructed using sandstone, granite, dolerite, and lime. “The technology involved filling a pit with a mixture of sand-lime, jaggery (for binding) as foundations before the stronger structures were constructed on ‘sandboxes’ to absorb the waves of the earthquake as the site is located under a seismic zone of the Godavari belt. Elephants were used as cranes to construct the ‘shikara’ roof of the temple,” said Prof M Panduranga Rao of the Kakatiya Heritage Trust who played a stellar role in coordinating with the Unesco to get the heritage tag for the temple.Floating bricks: “The bricks used in the construction of the temple shikhara or gopuram weighs 0.85 to 0.9 gms/cc which is lower than the density of water (1 gm/cc). It is made of clay mixed with acacia wood, chaff and myrobalan (a fruit), making it sponge-like, thus being able to float on water,” Rao said.Pillars reflect light onto sanctorum: “The presiding deity in the temple is Lord Shiva. In a significant architectural feat, daylight is reflected by the four granite pillars in the sanctorum which is diverted towards the inner sanctum, keeping it illuminated the whole day,” explained BV Papa Rao, a retired IAS officer, who along with the professor floated the heritage trust.Musical pillars: A pillar has the sculpture of Lord Krishna. He can be seen sitting on a tree playing his flute denoting the mythological tale of Gopika Vastrapaharanam. Saptaswaras (Sa Ri Ga Ma Pa Da Ni Sa) can be heard by tapping the sculpture of the lord.Warding off the evil eye: A portion of the main pillar inside the sanctorum is a little flawed. The carvings are misplaced. In fact, the portion also has a slight dent to it. Sculptor Ramappa intentionally left the space blank to ward off the evil eye, according to locals.13 needle holes: There is a fine carving on one of the pillars which is shaped like a bangle. It has 13 holes which, according to legend, indicate Lord Shiva’s Trayodashi (13 in Sanskrit). “According to Hindu mythology, Lord Shiva defeated demons on Trayodashi to save other sages. The 13 thin-threaded holes between the stone pillars reflect the richness of the architecture of Kakatiya kings. Only a small thread or a needle can pass through the holes of the sculpture. It is unclear as to how there were specific tools in the 13th century to carve this out,” said Papa Rao.Optical illusion: There is one carving where there are three dancers in the middle but there are only four legs. If you close the body of the middle dancer, you can see two girls dancing. But when you close the bodies of the girls on either side, the middle legs become the legs of the dancer in between.Thank you, elephants!: “There are 526 elephants (adding up to 13, the significance of which is explained above), carved on the outer walls of the temple. The startling fact is that each elephant is chipped differently. This was done to acknowledge the contribution of elephants in building the temple and transporting the granite stone. Also, the elephants face clockwise, indicating the ritual of Hindus walking in that direction around a shrine,” said Prof Panduranga Rao.Egyptian and Persian carvings: The figurines carved in sandstone all around the temple feature Persian men, Egyptian Pharaohs, among others, pointing to the trade relations the Kakatiyas had with these countries during the 13th century. There are also some sculptures of Jains and Buddhists.Mandakinis: There are 12 black stone statues of mandakinis (dancing figures) perched atop pillars of the temple. Each figure has a distinct feature with the one named, Ragini, wearing high heels. “The work is so intricate that on one mandakini, there is a shadow of a necklace worn by her which looks natural but is actually carved out. Irrespective of the angle of the sun, we can see the shade on her body,” explained Papa Rao.Kakatiya emblem: “You can also find carvings and statues of elephants and lions on the walls and pillars here. The foot is shaped like an elephant trunk, in the middle is a human shoulder and the top is a lion’s face. That is called Gaja Kesari which is the Kakatiya dynasty’s emblem. It is symbolic of their valour,” Papa Rao said.The temple is built with three different coloured stones (red, white and brown), with the colours merged on a single stone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/musical-pillars-floating-bricks-adorn-800-year-old-ramappa-temple-101627931307894.html
03-08-2021||India||Political circles abuzz after CM calls on former mentor Gowda||Bengaluru As chief minister Basvaraj Bommai on Sunday met Janata Dal (Secular) leader and former prime minister HD Deve Gowda in Bengaluru as a courtesy to his former mentor but the decision, in the middle of the intensifying political drama over the formation of the cabinet, has raised the possibility of using the family-run party as a stabiliser of sorts should the situation turn rocky with simmering dissent boiling over in the coming days within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), an analyst who didn’t want to be named said.JD(S) has 32 legislators in the lower house, the BJP has 118 and the Congress has 68. While in the Upper House, the BJP has 32, the JD(S) has 12 and the Congress has 29 members.While the obvious reasons are that the BJP needs the JD(S) for smooth passage of bills and consolidate their support bases in the upcoming Zilla and Taluk Panchayat elections apart from other urban local body polls, including Bengaluru corporation, the analyst cited above said that the reasons are more than what meets the eye.One is this is BS Yediyurappa’s way of challenging the high command and keeping control over the state. “They are putting together an alliance which asserts local power over the high command,” said one Bengaluru-based political analyst, requesting not to be named.The analyst said that despite the change in personalities “those who control power are the same”, referring to Yediyurappa, Gowda and Siddaramaiah. The JD(S) and the BJP have a very good working relationship, especially since the two parties consider the Congress as its common enemy, stitching local alliances in several regions of the state to tip the scales in its favour.But this is the party position but the personalities operate in a rather contrasting manner, observers said.A Narayana, political analyst and faculty at the Azim Premji University uses marketing language to state that the two parties are “hedging their bets”.Narayana said that if it was just a courtesy meeting then Bommai missed meeting SM Krishna, who is more senior to Gowda and with the BJP.n the unlikely event of this (cabinet formation) leading to some serious problem where several prominent senior leaders do not figure, this move (of stitching up an alliance with Gowda) is to state how they can keep the government going,” Narayana said.Unlike other states, where leaders of major parties barely see eye-to-eye, Karnataka’s turbulent politics has rested on local coalition building at least in the last two decades where the likes of BS Yediyurappa, Siddaramaiah and HD Deve Gowda have maintained healthy personal working relationships to remain relevant and aren’t hesitant to call for personal or political favours from time-to-time.The three have firmly resisted the “interference” by Delhi into Karnataka’s affairs as a way to keep control over a state.The cabinet expansion will force some legislators to lash out for being left out and the future of the turncoats, who engineered the collapse of the HD Kumaraswamy-led coalition government and backed Yediyurappa to power, hinges on a thin and uncertain thread.“We and this government, when it comes to crisis, we will give them our support,” Gowda said in Bengaluru on Sunday after his meeting with Bommai.Bommai was with the Janata Dal and later with Janata Dal (Secular) and even served as its deputy leader of the opposition in the legislative council from 2000 to 2004.But his personal equation has little to do with the meeting, people aware of the developments said, as it remains a show of strength and outreach to a party leader who has played “kingmaker” for over two decades now.Gowda(89) has remained central to the political discourse in Karnataka--and the country--over the last three decades, tactically maneuvering every hurdle that has come his way by stitching up alliances with both national parties to keep his party not just afloat but thrive.Gowda and the JD(S) also have almost the full backing of the dominant Vokkaliga community, believed to be the second largest caste group after the Lingayats, which firmly backed the regional outfit in the 2018 assembly elections after nursing a feeling of neglect under Siddaramaiah-led Congress rule from 2013.Analysts add that though BJP leaders rush to Delhi during any crisis situation, the last thing they want is for the Centre to dictate terms which has effectively “decentralised” power in Karnataka which is very different from how the saffron outfit operates in other parts of the state.Yediyurappa has rarely ever pushed for Hindutva and has based his entire politics on caste-based reservations, making it easier for him to use this card to get the powerful and influential Mathas or monasteries to his side, which no leader with all the backing of even the central leadership is likely to challenge, people aware of the developments said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-circles-abuzz-after-cm-calls-on-former-mentor-gowda-101627931187372.html
03-08-2021||India||B’luru civic body buckles up to tackle Covid spread||Bengaluru: The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) on Monday made institutional quarantine mandatory for those coming from Kerala and Maharashtra without carrying a RT-PCR negative test certificate. The move comes after the government on Saturday made negative test report mandatory for those entering Karnataka from these two neighbouring states. “Those coming from these states (Kerala and Maharashtra) must bring an RT-PCR test result. Those who come without it, will be tested and will be kept in quarantine until the results are available. those who will be quarantined pending results, will have to undergo institutional quarantine and not home quarantine,” said BBMP commissioner Gaurav Gupta. The state on Monday recorded a slight dip in new Covid cases as it logged 1,285 infections as against 1,875 cases on Sunday. The active caseload in the state now stands at 24,021. Bengaluru accounted for 290 new infections, taking its active cases to 8,670. As many as 25 fatalities were reported across the state on Monday, which took the state’s toll to 36,612. Bengaluru’s toll jumped to 15,885, with 5 more deaths being reported on Monday, according to the state health department. When asked if there are any plans to impose a weekend curfew, Gupta said, “We need to control the spread of the pandemic and make sure the economy returns to normalcy. We need to strike a balance on both fronts. The government will take a call on this (weekend curfew),” he said. He stressed on the need to follow the night curfew imposed in the city from 10 pm to 5 am. Police cooperation is key to ensure night curfew is followed properly, he added. The government on Saturday extended the existing restrictions till August 16 and said a decision on night curfew or weekend lockdown will be taken after 15 days after reviewing the progression of the situation. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Saturday had also informed that stringent border checking and random testing have also begun in the state. “I have reviewed the Covid status of 8 districts today. Last time the second wave came from Kerala and Maharashtra. Now again, Kerala is witnessing a surge in cases in the last few days. I have instructed to DCs to take care of it. And the testing unit has to be medical infrastructure has to be improved in these districts. Vaccination has to be done,” the chief minister had said following a review meeting on Saturday. Almost a month after lockdown restrictions in the city were eased, there has been an increase in the total number of Covid-19 cases, deaths, case fatality rate and positivity rate. The number of fresh Covid-19 cases registered in Bengaluru in the week between July 25-31 was 2,988 compared to 2,571 cases the previous week, as per the data released by the BBMP. Similarly, the number of deaths in Bengaluru was 48 in the week ending July 31 while the number of deaths in the previous week was 36. The positivity rate has increased from 0.62% to 0.72% in the week ending July 31. Meanwhile, the number of tests conducted in Bengaluru over the last two weeks have remained around 413,000 to 415,000 per week. However, the number of admissions in all hospitals in Bengaluru under government quota was 127 for the week ending July 31, lower than 143 in the previous week. “It not possible to say if this is the third wave or not, but the easing of lockdown will have an impact on the case. The important point here is that the government should not wait and watch but prepare aggressively for the worst-case scenario. The restrictions should be brought back slowly, instead of waiting till the last moment. The expert committee is constantly advising the government,” said a Technical Advisory Committee member, who didn’t want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bluru-civic-body-buckles-up-to-tackle-covid-spread-101627931067926.html

The police have booked Lingapalem panchayat secretary M Sugunraj and the sarpanch under section 429 of IPC and Section 11(l) of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.“It all started with a tip-off during Bakrid (July 21) that dog meat was being sold in the village. We immediately formed a team of four activists and started our investigation. After a few days, we were informed by the locals that a foul smell was emanating from the lakebed, on the outskirts of the village. We dug up and found at least 300 dog carcasses there. Looking at the decay, we are guessing all the dogs could have been poisoned and killed around July 26,” said Challapalli Srilatha, an activist for Fight for Animals. “We started gathering evidence and found out that poison was purchased from stores nearby. It was smeared onto darts and dogs were shot at by hired catchers. It is quite evident that the local panchayat is involved in it. They (panchayat body) receive money for vaccinating stray dogs, and they pay around ₹100 per animal to a dog catcher to kill them,” the activist alleged.Animal activists went the following morning along with evidence to the Dharmajigudem police station to register a complaint.“No one supported us. We were told that dogs being killed were not important, and they were preoccupied with murder cases. I sat there for 12 hours till they filed a zero FIR,” said Srilatha.Confirming that the FIR has been lodged, Dharmajigudem sub-inspector, P Ramesh, under whose jurisdiction the area comes, said carcasses of close to 300 dogs were found. “Postmortem was conducted on Sunday on 14 dogs, and we have sent samples to a forensic lab. We can only comment once we receive the post mortem and forensic report,” he said.Lingapalem panchayat secretary M Sugunraj denied the involvement of the panchayat body in the gruesome crime. “Local pig catchers informed me that stray dog carcasses were found buried in a pit near Perantam tank on July 29. I was the one who immediately went to the local police station to file a complaint at night. This is gruesome, and I know that killing dogs is against the Panchayati Raj Act. I suspect aggrieved locals must have hired dog catchers to kill the stray dogs,” he claimed.The activists claimed that the case was registered against the accused only when they approached district collector Karthikeya Misra and superintendent of police, Rahul Dev Sharma. The activists said they would take up the issue in court. “We are waiting for the postmortem report. We will approach the local court if the accused aren’t brought to book,” said Srilatha.ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/300-dogs-poisoned-in-andhra-village-say-activists-101627931067310.html
03-08-2021||India||Bommai calls on BJP brass in Delhi amid Cabinet rejig talks||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Monday continued his meeting with the national leadership of the BJP in his bid to finalise the new Cabinet. Bommai rushed to Delhi on Sunday night and is expected to remain in the national capital till Tuesday. The chief minister said that he will finalise the Cabinet after returning to the state. “We will discuss the whole process comprehensively on Cabinet formation including whether it should be in stages or at one go, regional and social representations,” he told reporters in Delhi on Monday before his meeting with the national leaders. Bommai, who met BJP national president JP Nadda on Monday night to finalise a list of probables for his new cabinet, after the meeting said that he has shared all relevant information about the ground realities with the national president and the latter has also given some advice and directions. “I have had a detailed discussion with our national president JP Nadda ji and have explained the ground situation in the state. They have also expressed certain things. We want to give a very proactive, credible cabinet and they have said that they will have a detailed discussion tomorrow. Since Parliament session is going on, so they might give us a final list by tomorrow evening or night and the list will be presented by the high command itself,” Bommai said. He added that there was no question of the turncoats being treated differently since they are no longer ’outsiders. Earlier, the CM added that not everyone can become ministers and that the final decision of the national leadership would be to find some balance and take everyone forward collectively. Bommai, however, indicated the possibility that the party is likely to form the Cabinet in phases to assess the disgruntlement as the list of aspirants continue to grow. The CM hinted that the Cabinet formation, at least the first phase, could be completed by Wednesday. As soon as speculations over Cabinet formation started doing the rounds, several leaders started making a beeline at former chief minister BS Yediyurappa’s residence, indicating how the 78-year-old continues to hold the reins of the new government under his confidant. Bommai was flanked by legislators from his own party who have been trying to retain their seats in the cabinet. This included the likes of Laxman Savadi and CC Patil while several others like Shashikala Jolle, Arvind Bellad and CP Yogeshwara among others are reportedly in Delhi trying to make a case for themselves. Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal), the firebrand legislator and critic of Yediyurappa, on Monday said that there is no guarantee of landing a ministerial berth by visiting Delhi. The rumblings within the BJP is unlikely to die down anytime soon as there are several senior legislators who are likely to be dropped which could antagonise them further and add to the already simmering tensions within the party, people aware of the developments said. “It is totally Delhi’s decision and we have to just wait for it,” said one three-time MLA, requesting anonymity. This legislator is in the running for a possible berth in the cabinet, according to at least three people aware of the developments. The national leadership has taken complete control over the formation of the Cabinet which, until a few years ago, was a consultative process with the chief minister being given the courtesy of at least presenting a list of probable choices. People aware of the developments said that the possible carving out of more posts for deputy CMs, has added to the uncertainty on who the likely candidates will be in the new Cabinet. Leaders like Gulihatti Shekar, an independent who helped form the first BJP government in Karnataka in 2008, has reminded the state and national leadership of their “sacrifices” that has helped the party grow from strength to strength over the years. The likes of Raju Gouda, Sunil Kumar and Apachu Ranjan among others who identify with the core-ideology of the party are expected to make the list, people aware of the developments said. Though there is still no clarity, several leaders like Shekar have batted for retaining the 13 turncoats who helped Yediyurappa to power in 2019. Shekar said that there should be no “injustice” of any kind to these 17 persons who are the reasons behind BJP coming back to power in Karnataka. “The 17 people should not face any kind of injustice. They have to be given primary importance,” the legislator from Hosadurga said on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bommai-calls-on-bjp-brass-in-delhi-amid-cabinet-rejig-talks-101627931008494.html
03-08-2021||India||Congo man’s death in police custody sparks outrage among Africans in city||The death of a 27-year-old African man in police custody has sparked outrage among the African community in the city. Joel Shindani Malu, who worked under the alias Jon according to police, was a Democratic Republic of Congo national and was arrested by the JC Nagar police on Sunday. As per the police’s claim, he died due to cardiac arrest while in custody, following which, a protest was held by some members of the African community on Monday morning in front of the police station. A minor scuffle between police and protesters was also reported. Hours after the incident, additional commissioner of police (West) Soumendu Mukherjee said that as per the National Human Rights Commission guidelines, a case has been registered, and investigation has been handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) from the local police. Police have also filed a complaint against some protesting Congo nationals for allegedly attacking the policemen on duty. As per the police’s claim, around 10.30 pm on Sunday, JC Nagar police received information regarding a drug peddler and a team was dispatched to the location. Police had sent an informer and some policemen in mufti as decoys to arrest suspects on the pretext of buying drugs. “A police team led by sub-inspector Raghupati laid a trap to catch a drug peddler Jon near 10th Cross, Banjara Layout. The Police team kept watch and waited till around 12:30 pm. Due to the sudden arrival of regular police patrolling van to the said place, the drug peddler named Jon changed the location of trade to Babusah Palya locality in Hennur PS limits,” read a statement issued by Dharamender Kumar Meena, deputy commissioner of police, north. The police team then proceeded to the new location, and around 12.30 am, two foreign nationals approached them on a scooter. “Once the police informant identified pillion rider as Jon, the policemen in mufti apprehended him. In that scuffle as Jon was trying to flee, few small plastic packets containing white colour substance fell on the ground which was suspected to be narcotics substance,” the officer claimed. The foreign national refused to give details or produce any document regarding his identity on enquiry by the police. On further enquiry, he confessed it to be MDMA, an illegal narcotic. Jon was brought to the police station, along with seized suspected narcotics substance, and bike at around 2.15 am and an FIR was registered against him. Around 5.10 am, in charge SHO (Station House Officer) informed the PSI Raghupati that Jon suddenly started complaining of chest pain. “PSI Raghupati immediately acted on this information and shifted him to nearby Chiraayu Hospital for treatment at around 5:30 am. On preliminary medical examination, he was diagnosed with Bradycardia and administrated several rounds of CPR and other lifesaving interventions. At around 6.45 am, he was declared dead due to suspected cardiac arrest,” said the DCP’s narrative of the events. The Congo nationals who protested in front of the police station claimed he was not a drug peddler and the police torture resulted in his death. “We got a call from our brother (Joel) that police had picked him up, and he needed money for bail. We arranged the money and came to the police station in the morning (Monday), then the police told us that he died. How can anyone believe this?” said one of the protesters who refused to identify himself. He further added that they were not allowed inside the police station and none of the officers provided any answers to their questions. They were later dispersed by the police. “We are students, we are here to study. We want a case registered against the officers responsible for his death,” said another student. Police claimed that on verification, it was found his visa had expired in 2015, and his passport had expired in 2017. Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant said that all procedures laid out by NHRC have been followed. “Postmortem by two doctors, inquest by a judge and the entire process has been recorded on video. Despite us following procedures, some Africans had tried to attack the police. We have arrested them, and the cases have been filed,” said Pant. He also pointed out that more than 90 foreign nationals have been arrested for drug peddling in the city this year.Meanwhile, CM Basavaraj Bommai while reacting on the incident on Monday said, “There are many African nationals (living in Bengaluru) and several of them who have overstayed beyond their visa. We are taking very strict action against this.” He added that they have asked for a CID probe and that protestors are attacking the police unnecessarily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congo-man-s-death-in-police-custody-sparks-outrage-among-africans-in-city-101627931007329.html
03-08-2021||India||Five journalists on Pegasus list move top court||Five journalists, who were reported to be on the potential list of alleged surveillance using Israeli Pegasus spyware, have moved the Supreme Court, ruing violation of their right to privacy and free speech.The petition, filed jointly by Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, SNM Abdi, Prem Shankar Jha, Rupesh Kumar Singh and Ipsa Shataksi, has demanded an unequivocal statement from the Union Government on use of Pegasus spyware and adduce before the top court all documents relating to authorising its use and investigation conducted into the alleged surveillance.The petition has requested the court to put in place a judicial oversight mechanism to deal with any complaints on illegal breaches of privacy by hacking and punish all government officials responsible for violations.A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, will on August 5 consider a clutch of three other petitions that have demanded a court-monitored investigation into the alleged snooping of Indian citizens using Pegasus and to identify the entities responsible for this. The fresh plea filed by the journalists is likely to be taken up along with these petitions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-journalists-on-pegasus-list-move-top-court-101627930768437.html
03-08-2021||India||Opposition likely to hold parallel Parliament as a mark of protest||Opposition parties are likely to consider an idea to hold a “parallel parliament” near Vijay Chowk to highlight their protests over Pegasus snooping row, spiraling fuel price and the contentious farm laws.Revolutionary Socialist Party(RSP) lawmaker NK Premachandran is one of the few leaders who have floated the idea.“Our protests are being blacked out. We are not getting any chance to speak in the House. Even the Leader of Opposition is not getting a chance to speak. A parallel parliament can be conducted at Vijay Chowk by Opposition parties to speak freely on our issues,” said Premachandran.While no final decision has been taken, some other leaders might consider it during the breakfast meeting of Opposition leaders convened by former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi.Parliament is reeling under Opposition protests since the beginning of the monsoon session. So far, only the Covid issue has been discussed in Rajya Sabha while the Lok Sabha could not take up a single structured discussion.Recently, the protesting farmers conducted a mock parliament session over the farm laws at the Jantar Mantar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-likely-to-hold-parallel-parliament-as-a-mark-of-protest-101627930707291.html

The International Telecommunication Union regulated the allocation of frequencies so that there is no interference between signals from different systems. The interoperability of the systems allows a user to seamlessly switch from one constellation system to another and results in improved navigation signal, especially in a situation where an area is obscured from one satellite system.“The interoperability is an important step, and it is the right time to do it. It took several years for ISRO to complete the navigation constellation. Now chipsets have also started coming in; this was the logical next step. ISRO will have to ensure that the signal and data provided is better than the already existing system so that users have an incentive to switch to NavIC,” said Ajay Lele, senior fellow working on space security and strategic technologies at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses.The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), also known as Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC), is a constellation of seven satellites that together provide navigation support over India and 1,500km around it. The first of the seven satellites was launched in 2013, and the constellation was completed in 2018. New smartphones in India running on Qualcomm chipsets released in 2020 can use IRNSS signals for navigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-to-expand-reach-of-navigation-system-globally-new-draft-policy-101627930648368.html
03-08-2021||India||Can’t detain a person on breach of law apprehension: Supreme Court||An apprehension of possible breach of law and order cannot provide a “springboard” to invoke the preventive detention law and arrest a citizen, the Supreme Court said on Monday, ordering the immediate release of a 34-year-old Telangana resident who has been held for 10 months.Banka Ravikanth has been in detention under the Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities Act 1986 on orders of the Cyberabad police commissioner in September 2020 after he secured bail in five criminal cases accusing him of cheating, criminal breach of trust and criminal intimidation under the Indian Penal Code.The Telangana police reasoned that Banka Ravikanth’s detention was ordered because there was every possibility that he would commit similar offences, which would again certainly affect public order. The Telangana high court, which ruled on a petition by Ravikanth’s wife Banka Sneha Sheela, agreed with this argument and rejected her petition in March this year.On Monday, the Supreme Court disagreed.“It is clear that at the highest, a possible apprehension of breach of law and order can be said to be made out if it is apprehended that the detenu, if set free, will continue to cheat gullible persons. This may be a good ground to appeal against the bail orders granted or to cancel bail but certainly cannot provide the springboard to move under a preventive detention statute,” a bench of justices Rohinton Fali Nariman and Hrishikesh Roy said on Monday.Arguing for the petitioner, advocate Gaurav Agrawal said the detention order was issued nine months after the last FIR registered in December 2019 and showed no proximate connection between the acts complained and ground for detention.The state government, represented by senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, submitted that Ravikanth was a habitual fraudster who “created fear amongst the gullible public”. Since he was likely to commit similar offences in future, it was important to preventively detain him as there was no deterrent available under any other law.The bench, on a close reading of the detention order, said that the “reason for the said order is not any apprehension of widespread public harm, danger or alarm but is only because the detenu was successful in obtaining anticipatory bail/bail from the courts in each of the five FIRs.”The bench noted that “mere contravention of law such as indulging in cheating or criminal breach of trust certainly affects ‘law and order’ but before it can be said to affect public order, it must affect the community or the public at large.” If a person accused of any crime is granted anticipatory bail/bail wrongly, the state can always appeal against the bail order granted or seek cancellation of bail, which, the court noted, was not done in the present case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sccant-detain-a-person-on-breach-of-law-apprehension-101627930648912.html
03-08-2021||India||Extreme rainfall events may increase: Experts||Extreme rainfall events during monsoon months are likely to only increase in all emission scenarios and are expected to spike further where the current global emission trends continue and no efforts are made to cut down emissions, a senior scientist from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) said on Monday.IITM’s climate model, Earth System model is contributing to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 6th Assessment Report. It is the first Indian model to contribute to IPCC’s evaluation.“Most climate models agree that extreme rainfall events during monsoon months will increase. We are already seeing a rise in these trends in recent years. Our model is also showing similar results that extreme events will increase in future. Not every extreme rainfall event can be attributed to climate change directly. Natural variability is combining with anthropogenic climate change to create this complex scenario,” Professor Ravi Shankar Nanjundiah, director, IITM, said during a press conference.He added that due to the long residence time of greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere its difficult to say when the occurrence of extreme rainfall events stabilise. On whether we have crossed the threshold on moderating extreme rainfall events, he explained: “We have already crossed 400 PPM of globally averaged carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. This cannot be reversed soon...if we continue with business as usual, we are in for very tough times and are likely to see a rapid increase in extreme rainfall events during monsoon months in India.”Nanjundiah’s comments come ahead of IPCC presenting its report, the Climate Change 2021: the Physical Science Basis. The IPCC is meeting remotely from July 26 to August 6 to approve the report.India experienced a spate of extreme rainfall events this July leading to flooding, landslides and loss of life in the Konkan and Madhya Maharashtra region and towards end of July there were several cloudburst events in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir which caused widespread devastation.IITM is presently hosting International Conference on Clouds and Precipitation 2021 where international scientists and cloud physicists will discuss latest research on clouds, convection and rain with particular focus on the monsoon. “Clouds are a major uncertainty in climate change projections, so their role is very important,” said Prof Andrea Flossmann, President, ICCP Commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/extreme-rainfall-events-may-increase-experts-101627930588362.html
03-08-2021||India||JD(U) delegation meets Shah over caste census||NEW DELHI: As calls for a caste-based census grow, a delegation of Janata Dal (United) MPs, led by party president Lalan Singh, met Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday. The demand comes ahead of the upcoming assembly elections in five states, including in Uttar Pradesh where caste composition is perceived to play a key role in determining electoral outcome.On Saturday, the JD(U) passed a resolution in support of the caste-based counting of population, a move with potentially wide political ramifications, during its national executive meeting. The Bihar assembly has passed unanimous resolutions, in 2019 and 2020, favouring a census on the caste lines.“Bihar assembly has passed a resolution favouring caste-based census twice, which was supported by the BJP as well. All the party MPs from Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha signed the memorandum and explained all the benefits of caste-based census pointwise to the home minister,” Singh told reporters after the meeting, stressing that it is now up to the central government to take the final decision.According to a person aware of the details, Shah is learnt to have told the delegation that the government will discuss the issue.On Sunday, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar said that he will seek an appointment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the issue of a caste-based census. Kumar, who is the de facto leader of the JD(U), however, asserted that divergent stands adopted by his party and the BJP, which heads the Union government, on the issue will not affect the coalition. Apart from JDU, another ally of the BJP, the Republican Party of India, has also demanded a caste-based census.The last caste-based census was conducted in 1931. In 1941, however, the data was collected but not made public. In 2011, a Socio Economic Caste Census for collecting data on the basis of caste and economic status of every household in the country was carried out but the caste data was again not made public, citing “discrepancies”. At present, apart from the Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes, the other backward castes are grouped under the OBC category.The Centre has said, as a matter of policy, there will be no enumeration as per caste other than that for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) for the census. It has cited the provisions of the Constitution and reservation of seats for SCs and STs in Lok Sabha and in the assemblies as per their proportion in the population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jdu-delegation-meets-shah-over-caste-census-101627930528350.html
03-08-2021||India||Political row erupts over J&K govt order on Davinder Singh||A political controversy broke out on Monday over a Jammu and Kashmir government order in May dismissing former police officer Davinder Singh, who was held last year for alleged involvement in terrorism and espionage.Singh was dismissed from service by lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha in a May 20 order that said the L-G “was satisfied” that the activities of Singh, a suspended deputy superintendent of police at the time,warranted his dismissal from service.The same order also said that Sinha was “satisfied that in the interest of the security of state, it is not expedient to hold an enquiry in the case of Mr Davinder Singh.”The order, which was issued by the commissioner secretary of the general administration department on behalf of Sinha, cited clause 2 of Article 311 of the Constitution, which carves out an exception for holding an inquiry before dismissing a person from service.”If the president or the governor, as the case may be, is satisfied that in the interest of the security of the state, it is not expedient to hold such inquiry,” the clause says.The Opposition accused the government of hiding facts and double standards.“Innocent Kashmiris arrested under anti-terror laws rot in jails for years. For them the trial becomes the punishment. But GOI (Government of India) doesn’t want an enquiry against a cop caught red-handed with militants. Is it because he colluded with the system to orchestrate certain dodgy incidents?” former CM Mehbooba Mufti tweeted.In another tweet, Mehbooba said, “Kashmiris are considered guilty until proven innocent... But when a policeman is known to have facilitated militants, he is let off the hook. The double standards & dirty games is (sic) obvious,”.“Who is J&K Dy. SP Davinder Singh? Why can’t government hold an enquiry? Why does the enquiry threaten national security? What is his role,if any, in Pulwama? Who was he arrested with? What’s the name of his accomplices? What is the Modi govt hiding? Nation has a right to know!”tweeted Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala on Sunday.A senior government officer said on condition of anonymity that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) had investigated Singh and there was nothing hidden about his role.“All those involved in this case have been arrested. The case against Davinder Singh and the terrorists arrested with him has already been thoroughly investigated,” he elaborated.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) dismissed the allegations and said anyone involved or affiliated with terror activities faced action.“The case of Davinder Singh is already being investigated by the NIA so everything about the case will come out,” said BJP leader Altaf Thakur.In January last year, Singh was intercepted and arrested by security forces on the way to Jammu along with two Hizbul Mujahideen commanders, Naveed Babu and Rafi Ahmed Rather. A third man arrested with them was Irfan Shafi Mir, a local lawyer.The NIA probed the case and filed a 3,064-pages charge sheet and accused the officer of “waging war against India”.Former J&K law secretary, Mohammad Ashraf Mir said one of the three exceptions to the protection granted to civil servants under Article 311 is for reasons of national security. “There are concerns like security of the state and secrecy and the enquiry may open these things. Where the government thinks it is not expedient to hold inquiry in the interest of the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-row-erupts-over-j-k-govt-order-on-davinder-101627930528968.html
03-08-2021||India||Parliament impasse on, Opposition to frame its strategy today||Defence minister Rajnath Singh reached out to at least two senior Opposition leaders on Monday in an effort to bring the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament back on the rails, but with both the government and the Opposition sticking to their respective positions, chances of this happening are fast slipping away.The defence minister spoke to the Rajya Sabha’s Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge of the Congress and the Trinamool Congress’s Lok Sabha chief Sudip Bandopadhyay. Both reiterated that a debate on the Pegasus snooping row is a must for disruptions to end, people familiar with the matter said. As many as 13 opposition parties have been protesting from the first day of the monsoon session over the Pegasus controversy, the three farm laws and spiraling fuel prices.“ I told him (Singh) that Pegasus is not a personal issue but the party’s issue and a debate should take place,” said Bandopadhyay.Amid repeated adjournments and fierce protests, productivity of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha now stand at just 14% and 20%. Both Houses faced repeated disruptions and protests on Monday. The government managed to introduce the Tribunals Reforms Bill in the Lok Sabha amidst the din. During the day, the Lower House passed the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Amendment Bill, 2021 before it was adjourned for the day. The Rajya Sabha approved the Inland Vessels Bill, 2021.On Tuesday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi will meet all Opposition MPs over breakfast in a bid to consolidate the Opposition’s new-found unity and discuss the strategy for the remaining part of the session. The Akali Dal’s Naresh Gujral said his party has not been invited for the meeting.The Pegasus row erupted on July 18 after an international investigative consortium reported that many Indian ministers, politicians, activists, businessmen and journalists were among the 50,000 numbers that were potentially targeted by Israeli company NSO Group’s phone hacking software, Pegasus, with a forensic analysis of 10 of the targets proving they had been hacked or that there had been attempts to do so.But the long spell of disruptions have also led to underlying tension within the Opposition ranks.“A section of the Opposition is of the view now that marathon disruption is hurting Opposition’s interest as the government is clearing two bills daily,” said a senior leader of an opposition party.The government’s floor managers, however, said the opposition was given a chance to discuss the Pegasus issue but instead opted to disrupt the House. The Opposition wants Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to be in the House during the debate. The BJP leader added that the opposition had a chance to ask questions when IT Minister Ashwani Vaishnaw made a statement on the controversy in both houses of Parliament. “The government did not run away from addressing the issue. A statement was made by the minister in charge on the floor of the House in Parliament...”Congress chief whip Jairam Ramesh maintained that the government has offered no proposal for a debate so far and there’s no outreach. “The Opposition has told the government managers to call a meeting chaired by Singh in a bid to end the stalemate,” Ramesh added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-impasse-on-opposition-to-frame-its-strategy-today-101627930111107.html
03-08-2021||India||Judge death case: SIT submits report, two sent to judicial custody||The Dhanbad police on Monday sent the two accused in the additional district judge Uttam Anand death case into judicial custody after questioning. The special investigation team (SIT) constituted to probe the incident submitted its report with the Jharkhand high court, which is likely to hear the case on Tuesday. The high court had taken suo motu cognisance of the incident on Thursday and directed the policeto submit an investigation report by August 3. Later on Friday, the Supreme Court also took cognisance of the incident and sought a report from the state, even after clarifying it was interested in the high court hearing related to the matter. Dhanbad senior superintendent of police Sanjiv Kumar confirmed the police have submitted the report to the high court but refused to share the details.Additional director general (operations) Sanjay Anand Lathkar told reporters that all possible angles to understand the reason behind the road accident that killed Anand is being investigated. The CCTV footage of the incident casts doubts over the nature of the accident as the auto-rickshaw that killed Anand is seen swerving to the extreme left of the road from the centre before hitting the judge down and fleeing from the spot. The two persons -- Lakhan Verma and Rahul Verma--- riding the allegedly stolen three-wheeler, were arrested a day later, and the vehicle recovered. However, the police are yet to officially disclose the motive of the two persons behind the accident. “Different teams are looking into the incident. They have been given specific leads to work on. We are leaving no possible angle to crack the case,” Lathkar told reporters after a marathon meeting in Dhanbad on Monday. On a specific question, if the police would go for narco test of the two accused arrested in the case, Lathkar said, “As of now, the two have been sent into judicial custody. But if required, we will use all scientific techniques in the course of the investigation.”Meanwhile, since the SIT took over the case, around 250 persons were picked up for questioning in connection with the case. “Altogether, 243 persons were picked up for questioning. Most of these men were those who have had a criminal history in the past. Some have been convicted in different cases. However, all of them were released after questioning. Till now, only two persons have been arrested in the case,” SSP Sanjiv Kumar said. The Hemant Soren government on Saturday has recommended a CBI probe in the incident. However, the central investigation agency is yet to begin a probe in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/judge-death-case-sit-submits-report-two-sent-to-judicial-custody-101627929747281.html
03-08-2021||India||PM Modi launches e-RUPI for digital payment||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday launched a “person and purpose-specific” one-time cashless and contactless digital payment vouchers ‘e-RUPI’ that aim to catalyse the direct transfer of subsidies to beneficiaries without any leakage.Although the e-RUPI vouchers will initially be available for health services, they will gradually cover other welfare schemes of the government, and can also be used by the corporate sector.“In addition to the government, if any organisation wants to help someone in their treatment, education or for any other work, then they will be able to give an e-RUPI voucher instead of cash. It will ensure that the money given by him, is used for the work for which the amount was given,” PM Modi said.The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) in association with the Department of Financial Services (DFS), the National Health Authority (NHA), the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), and commercial banks, have developed the digital solution.“The users of this seamless one-time payment mechanism will be able to redeem the voucher without a card, digital payments app or internet banking access, at the merchants accepting e-RUPI. e-RUPI would be shared with the beneficiaries for a specific purpose or activity by organisations or government via SMS or QR code,” NPCI said on its website.So far, more than ₹17.5 lakh crore have been transferred directly to the accounts of the poor via DBT, benefiting 900 million Indians in the form of cooking gas subsidy, ration, medical treatment, scholarship, pension and wage disbursal.Bharat Panchal, CRO at fintech firm FIS, said: “The new digital payment mode-- e-RUPI-- is basically a prepaid voucher that can be issued directly to citizens after verifying mobile number and identity. e-RUPI voucher will be delivered in the form of a QR code or SMS string-based e-voucher to the beneficiary’s mobile number.”“The beneficiary can redeem the voucher without a card, digital payments app or internet banking access, at the service provider. This would be very useful instrument for those who are not privy to use to the digital platform yet the government can extend monetary support in digital form directly to citizens in a ‘leak-proof manner’ in the form of prepaid e-voucher powered by UPI [Unified Payment Interface].”TV Narendran, president, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), said the new payment mechanism would ensure monetary support to citizens without the involvement of intermediaries. “It will also be an excellent tool for the corporates, through which they can extend employee and community welfare schemes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmlaunches-e-rupi-for-digital-payment-101627929629516.html
03-08-2021||India||Supreme Court rejects pleas by rape survivor, convict to marry each other||The Supreme Court on Monday refused to facilitate marriage between a woman and her rapist, a former Catholic priest from Kerala who is undergoing 20 years’ jail term for the crime committed on her when she was a minor.A bench of justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari dismissed the petitions moved separately by the woman and Robin Vadakkumcherry Mathew.Mathew was the vicar of St Sebastian’s Church at Kottiyoor in Wayanad district when the crime occurred. He was the manager of a church-backed school where the survivor, then a Class XI student, was studying. She got pregnant due to the crime and gave birth to a girl child in February 2017.A childline agency that worked among schoolchildren met the survivor and she told them about her ordeal. Accordingly, they filed a complaint based on which a rape case was registered against Mathew. He was convicted in February 2019 and sentenced to 20 years in jail. The Vatican, too, defrocked him.Citing several Supreme Court judgments that lay down that a rape case cannot be settled, the Kerala high court had refused to suspend Mathew’s sentence for marriage, saying that a judicial approval cannot be granted to a marriage when the woman he intended to marry is the one whom he had raped.Against this order, Mathew and the survivor approached the top court, asking for bail to Mathew to enable him to come out and marry. While the woman emphasised that the marriage will give legitimacy to the child born to her, Mathew argued that the courts must not stop him from exercising his “fundamental right to marry”.Senior advocate Kiran Suri appeared for the woman and advocate Amit George represented the former priest in the apex court. Suri said that the child was of school-going age, and hence the father’s name needed to be mentioned in the school admission application form.On his part, George argued that the Kerala high court order made scathing and sweeping observations against his client, virtually foreclosing all possibilities for Mathew to walk out of jail even for a brief period. “How can my fundamental right to marriage be restricted while deciding a bail application?” asked the lawyer.But the bench was unmoved. “You invited it yourself. The high court order is a well-reasoned order. It has made the observations after considering all aspects of the matter. We do not want to disturb the findings of the high court,” said the bench.It also asked George about the age of his client and the survivor, and he said Mathew is 49 and the woman 25.At this, the bench said that it would not interfere in a matter like this and that Mathew should resort to other remedies available to him under the law, including raising his grievances before the high court where his appeal against the sentence imposed by a special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) court in 2019 was pending.Mathew was arrested on February 27, 2017, from near Kochi international airport while trying to slip out of the country. He was sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment on February 17, 2019 by a court in Thalassery after he was tried under the POCSO Act.During the trial, the survivor and her mother turned hostile. But the trial court proceeded on the basis of evidence collected already and handed out the guilty verdict for Mathew. Mathew had also argued during the trial that the girl was impregnated by her own father. However, the DNA of the child, which clearly attributed paternity to Mathew, acted as a clinching piece of evidence, resulting in his conviction.Four nuns, another priest and one more woman attached to the convent, who were made co-accused in the police chargesheet, were let off due to lack of evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-rejects-pleas-by-kerala-rape-survivor-convict-to-marry-each-other-101627929507190.html
03-08-2021||India||Permanent commission to women: Implement order instead of seeking clarifications, says SC to govt||The Supreme Court on Monday refused to entertain requests for clarification on the grant of permanent commission to women short service commission officers (WSSCO) and said that any clarification on its March 25 judgment should be addressed to the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT).“As judges, we get fed up with miscellaneous applications (MA). There are human limitations on us. We have laid down the law for a broad class of individuals. How can we entertain individual cases of officers?” the bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah said. Before the judges were two sets of applications filed by the Centre and women officers seeking clarifications on the implementation of the Supreme Court’s March 25 verdict.In its March 25 ruling, the Indian Army was directed to positively grant permanent commission to all WSSCOs who obtained 60% marks in their assessment subject to their meeting the medical criteria prescribed by the army’s August 1 2020 order and receiving disciplinary and vigilance clearance. The court gave the government three months to complete this exercise.The Centre’s application asked whether permanent commission should be granted to WSSCOs who obtained the benchmark 60% marks as laid down by the court but were found “unfit” on discipline or vigilance grounds by a selection board that considered their case in September 2020.The army said that out of 529 WSSCOs who opted for permanent commission, 514 fulfilled the 60% grade criteria.But 72 of the 514 women officers were ineligible for grant of PC under the two army policies of September 30, 1983 and February 24, 2012, that require WSSCOs to be “fit” and secure at least 60% marks and wanted the court to spell out if it meant permanent commissions had to be granted irrespective of the criteria being met.“Government should not have filed this application. We do not want to encourage this. Everything was argued before us and now we won’t entertain it,” the bench said.Women short service commission officers who were denied permanent commission (PC) and face the prospect of being released from service next month were also before the court with a prayer to stay their release.The bench asked them to approach the tribunal. “The Government has given benefits to a large mass of people (among WSSCOs). By mistake, if the benefit may have been left out for some, for that the AFT is there.”“What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. You have not yet gone to the tribunal,” the bench remarked, noting that some women officers have already approached the tribunal.Senior advocates Huzefa Ahmadi and Meenakshi Arora, appearing for WSSCOs, agreed to the suggestion but sought a time-bound decision on their case. The bench disposed of their request, ordering that their petitions seeking “substantive and interim relief” shall be considered expeditiously by the tribunal.The Centre’s application contained other prayers too including a two-month extension to implement the order.It also sought to expunge remarks of “systemic discrimination” made against the army with regard to the annual confidential report (ACR) assessment and career progression of WSSCOs. The direction requiring the army to reconstitute the same selection board which originally considered the batch mates of the affected WSSCOs was also sought to be modified.Appearing for the Centre, additional solicitor general (ASG) Balbir Singh and senior advocate R Balasubramanian said it will be better for the top court to clarify these aspects to avoid multiplicity of proceedings.The bench responded: “You must implement the judgment as it stands. There is an attempt on part of your client (Centre) to go around our judgment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/permanent-commission-to-women-implement-order-instead-of-seeking-clarifications-says-sc-to-govt-101627929389758.html
03-08-2021||India||Covaxin effective against new Delta Plus variant, says study||Covaxin can effectively neutralise the Delta Plus (AY.1), the vaccine’s manufacturer Bharat Biotech said citing laboratory studies it carried out along with the Indian Council of Medical Research. The study, which is yet to be peer-reviewed, showed that the vaccine’s ability to neutralise the variants was lower than what was seen with the ancestral version of the Sars-Cov-2, similar to what has been seen with the case of other vaccines.The scientists carried out lab tests with antibodies derived from three groups of people – those who had two doses of vaccines but no infection, those had both doses of the vaccine after recovering from Covid-19 and those who had Covid after getting both doses (breakthrough infections).These antibodies were then made to react with three variants – Delta, Delta Plus and B.1.617.3, as well as the B.1 (the version prior to the mutation).The study found neutralising antibodies, which bind to the Sars-CoV-2 virus, was the higher in people who had the infection along with vaccination, rather than those who just received the vaccines. But, the authors said, there wasn’t significant reduction in antibody levels against the variants as compared to the original one in those who received only the vaccine. The blood serum of recovered cases with vaccinations and breakthrough cases had considerable fold-reductions, said the study.“Vaccine is showing very high neutralizing titre in all three categories of sera whether it’s full vaccinated, recovered cases with vaccination or breakthrough cases. The titres of recovered cases with vaccination or breakthrough cases are very high... Natural infection offers good protection,” said Dr Pragya Yadav, senior scientist at Natio-nal Institute of Virology and one of the authors of the paper.“But after some time the antibody titres drop; immunization boosts it. That is why people should get immunized after recovery.”To be sure, neutralising antibody titers do not reflect efficacy rates, which are based on a vaccine’s real-world ability to prevent symptomatic infection. Bharat Biotech in June said the final efficacy estimates, based on its phase 3 trials, showed Covaxin had an efficacy rate of 77.8% against the Sars-Cov-2 virus that most closely resembles the origin virus, and 65.8% against the Delta variant, which is now predominant in India.The reduction in neutralising activity in the latest study was observed in fully vaccinated individuals who never had Covid-19 was seen to be 1.3, 1.5, 1.9-fold against Delta, AY.1, and B.1.617.3. Similarly, the reduction in neutralising titre in those who had an infection and were then immunised was 2.5, 3.5, 3.8-fold, and in those who had a breakthrough infection it was 1.9, 2.8, 3.5-fold when compared against the corresponding neutralisation levels seen in people with the ancestral version of variants.“What this essentially means is get vaccinated. It is great news that all the vaccines seem to be working against all the variants...,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College-Vellore||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-effective-against-new-delta-plus-variant-says-study-101627928429192.html
03-08-2021||India||Supreme Court notice to states on use of scrapped Section 66A||The Supreme Court on Monday observed that police cannot continue to lodge cases under the scrapped Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, seeking an explanation from all states and Union territories on steps taken by them to comply with the court’s March 2015 judgment which declared the provision null and void.A bench of justices Rohinton F Nariman and BR Gavai accepted the central government’s argument that the states were issued repeated reminders by the Union ministry of home affairs, and that the onus was on them and their police departments to stop lodging fresh cases under the scrapped provision.“Ultimately, police is a state subject. States will have to be put on notice...this (registration of cases) cannot continue,” said the bench while seeking replies from states and UTs in four weeks.Earlier this month (on July 5), the bench said it was “shocking” and “distressing” that there was a fivefold increase in the registration of cases under Section 66A though the provision was quashed as it heard an application by NGO People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL). The NGO highlighted that the situation on the ground did not change even after the Supreme Court in February 2019 asked the chief secretaries and directors general of police of all states and UTs to ensure that the 2015 judgment was widely publicised.On Monday, attorney general KK Venugopal and solicitor general Tushar Mehta appeared for the Union government and pointed out that the MHA has been sending letters to the states to instruct their police departments to stop registering cases under Section 66A, and that the latest communication to this effect was on July 13. The SG added that the police and law and order were state subjects.On his part, senior counsel Sanjay Parikh, representing the NGO, submitted that apart from the police departments, directions will have to be issued to the district judiciary as well to ensure that whenever such cases are brought before the trial courts, they dropped the charges under the said provision.The court acknowledged this problem. “Yes, you are right. We will take the issue of judiciary independently and will also ask registrar generals of the high courts,” responded the bench, also issuing notices to the registrar generals of all the 24 high courts.“We want to pass a concrete order after hearing all of them,” emphasised the bench while directing that along with the notices, states and the registrar generals of the HCs should also be sent PUCL’s application and the affidavit filed by the Union government.The bench was hearing PUCL’s application that revealed that after the law was quashed by the SC in 2015, the police in different states went on to lodge 1,307 new cases under the same provision. This demonstrated a fivefold hike as there were only 229 cases pending in 11 states when the Supreme Court struck down the provision that authorised police to arrest people for social media posts construed as “offensive” or “menacing”.On July 5, the bench sought a reply from the Union government on measures undertaken to ensure implementation of its 2015 judgment. In its reply, the Centre maintained that it was the primary duty of states and UTs to desist from lodging any fresh cases under Section 66A of the IT Act and withdraw prosecutions from all such cases. It said that 21 states wrote to the IT ministry between January and April of 2019, saying they issued suitable directions to the police departments and complied with the 2015 verdict.The Centre’s affidavit, however, disclosed that these 21 states did not include Maharashtra, which topped the list in registration of cases after the judgment with 381 cases, followed by Jharkhand (291), and Uttar Pradesh (245). Also, while the Rajasthan government reported compliance with the 2015 verdict, the NGO’s application stated that there were more than 70 cases still pending prosecution in the state under the scrapped provision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-notice-to-states-on-use-of-scrapped-section-66a-101627928367200.html
03-08-2021||India||India-made Sputnik V Covid vaccine may be available from September: Dr Reddy’s||Locally manufactured Sputnik V vaccines against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) are expected to be available in India within September or October, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories told news agency ANI on Monday."We have received 31.5 lakh doses of component 1 and 4.5 lakh doses of component 2 of the Sputnik V vaccine in India. We are working closely with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) to ramp up supplies. We are also working closely with our partners in India for manufacturing readiness,” ANI reported quoting a release by the company.The company further stated that the Russian vaccine launch has seen a “gradual and steady commercial scale-up and roll-out” all over India since its soft pilot in May and now spreading to around 80 Indian cities.“We have partnered with major hospitals around the country and set up our cold chain infrastructure across more than 300 locations since the vaccine requires -18°C temperature,” the release added.Notably, the RDIF said on Saturday that the production of Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccines in India is expected to come “fully on stream” in September.“RDIF expects India to become a major production hub of Sputnik V,” a statement issued by Russia’s sovereign wealth fund read.In the statement, the RDIF mentioned the Pune-based world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, Serum Institute of India (SII) among several pharmaceutical companies with which it has joined hands to manufacture Sputnik V jabs in India.Notably, SII will produce over 300 million doses of the Russian vaccine annually, starting this year. On the other hand, RDIF has entered a partnership with Dr Reddy’s Labs to market the first 250 million doses of Sputnik V in India.The vaccine is a two-dost shot, but as opposed to other two-dose coronavirus vaccines, both the jabs of the Sputnik V vaccine is unidentical. It has been found 91.6% effective against Covid-19 as was observed in its phase 3 clinical trials.The Russian vaccine’s soft launch rollout commenced initially in Hyderabad on May 14, and since then it has reached many major cities of India such as Bengaluru, Delhi-NCR, Chennai, Pune, Kolkata, Mumbai, Indore, Bhopal, Nagpur, Patna, Lucknow, Guwahati, Bhubaneswar, and Jaipur, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiamade-sputnik-v-covid-19-vaccine-may-be-available-from-september-dr-reddy-101627927337311.html
03-08-2021||India||A week later, Assam-Mizoram dispute hits economic activities on both sides of border||A week after the clash between Assam and Mizoram at Lailapur border on July 26, an undeclared economic blockade prevails against the latter, with most truck drivers admitting they are afraid to move towards Mizoram, even as protests against the killing of six Assam policemen in the incident, dot the Barak Valley in the state.Hundreds of trucks carrying essential goods for Mizoram are stranded in various parts Assam’s Cachar district . Most of these trucks can be seen parked on the 43-km-long highway from Silchar to Lailapur.M Ravi, 45, a truck driver, is a resident of Hyderabad who travelled for almost a week from Chennai to Cachar district of Assam, but he has been waiting near the Mizoram border since July 27. His truck is carrying liquid milk packets. “I have travelled to Mizoram several times in past but never witnessed a situation like this. There were tensions in border area in past and I have faced some economic blockades in Assam’s side a few times. But this year, it seems the end is not near...”Drivers and cleaners on Sonai Road, Nagatilla, Sonabarighat, Kabuganj or Dholai can be seen cooking or resting by the roadside and some claim they are running out of money.Mukesh Kumar Jat, a truck driver from Rajasthan, said, “We are short of money and also food... We have been stranded on the road for the past six days. We just want to leave.”But the blockade cuts both ways, if unequally.In the border areas of Assam, for instance, it has hit small businesses. The Monday market at Channi Ghat area under Dholai constituency of Cachar, around 2.5 km from the Khulicherra border between Assam and Mizoram, was patronised by well-off Mizos. “Initially Covid-19 hit sales, and now this. Mizos loved to buy dry fish from our market,”said a seller at the market.Near the Dholai police station is Aizawl FC (Mizo Dawr), another shop patronised by Mizos. “I can speak Mizo language and have so many friends in Mizoram... Government’s policies have created a situation where common people are suffering,” said the owner, a Bengali.There also appears to be a breakdown in trust.Abdul Ali , 25 was shot in the forehead with an air gun. After a week, he has returned home. But everything has changed. “Now we are afraid to talk to the Mizos... It seems we are sharing border with a different country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-week-later-dispute-hits-economic-activities-on-both-sides-of-border-101627928307949.html
03-08-2021||India||Assam, Mizoram drop cases as key N-E leaders call on PM Modi||Mizoram and Assam withdrew police cases against each other as key leaders from the North-East met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, underlining that interstate ties bruised by an unprecedented gunbattle last week are on the mend after central intervention.Mizoram governor K Hari Babu met Modi in Delhi and said the Centre was trying to find a solution to the standoff that killed seven people and left 41 others injured. “The home minister is trying to defuse the tension and he is trying to find the solution. Both chief ministers have committed that peace will be restored,” said Babu.Separately, a group of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmakers and two Union ministers – law minister Kiren Rijiju and shipping minister Sarbananda Sonowal -- also met the PM, who assured the leaders of an amicable solution to the dispute.The leaders — 12 from Assam, two from Arunachal Pradesh and one each from Manipur and Tripura — submitted a memorandum praising the BJP’s efforts and accused the Opposition of fanning tensions.“We assured him (PM Modi) unity of Northeast & that the unfortunate incident at Assam-Mizoram border won’t be allowed to affect his vision to develop NE region,” tweeted Rijiju after the meeting.The easing of tensions was also marked by the withdrawal of cases in both states.Mizoram said it won’t proceed against Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and six other officials on attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy charges. “In order to build a conducive atmosphere for amicable solution to the Mizoram, Assam border dispute and to reduce the plight of suffering citizens. I have directed Mizoram Police to withdraw FIR dated July 26 filed at Vairengte, Kolasib in Mizoram...,” Mizoram CM Zoramthanga tweeted on Monday.Assam responded by withdrawing police cases against Mizoram MP L K Vanlalvena and two senior officials, but said proceedings against four other officials will continue. “I learn that hon’ble CM Zoramthanga has asked Mizoram Police to withdraw FIR dated July 26 against our officers. I heartily reciprocate this positive gesture and ask Assam Police to withdraw cases against DC, Kolasib and SDPO Vairengte,” Sarma tweeted.He also announced that two Assam cabinet ministers will travel to Mizoram’s capital Aizawl to hold talks on August 5.The developments came a day after Shah spoke to Sarma and Zoramthanga to defuse tensions.Assam’s Barak Valley districts of Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi share a 164.6km-long border with Mizoram’s Aizawl, Kolasib and Mamit districts. The decades-old border dispute escalate on July 26 when police forces of the two states fought a pitched gun battle, in which six Assam policemen and a civilian died.Silchar MP Rajdeep Roy said the PM assured the delegation that an “amicable solution” will be found to the problem. “All channels of negotiations, not just between the two CMs, but with all the relevant people have been opened. And de-escalation is already happening at the border since this evening,” Roy added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-mizoram-drop-cases-as-key-n-e-leaders-call-on-pm-101627928188170.html

03-08-2021||India||Bill for amendment of general insurance law passed in House||Lok Sabha on Monday passed a Bill to amend the general-insurance law and allow the government to offload its stake in state-run insurance corporations, clearing its first hurdle without discussion as Parliament continued to witness pandemonium.The General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Amendment Bill, 2021 seeks to permit the government to cut its stake in prominent state-owned general insurance corporations, helping achieve its divestment targets. Divestment refers to the government’s selling of part of its ownership in state-run corporations.The Bill aims to amend the parent Act, The General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Act, 1972. Lok Sabha proceedings witnessed disruption by opposition members and had to be adjourned until Tuesday.While presenting the budget 2021-22 in February, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said: “We propose to take up the privatisation of two public sector banks and one general insurance company in the year 2021-22. This would require legislative amendments and I propose to introduce the amendments in this session (Budget) itself.” The government however did not introduce the Bill in the Budget Session in February.The finance minister, while introducing the Bill in Lok Sabha on June 30, sought to suggest that the government was not aiming to fully privatise government-backed insurers.“It is not to privatise, we are certainly bringing some enabling provision so that citizens can have some participation. Our market can give the money from retail funds, through Indian citizens. It can enable faster growth for such insurance companies. The public participation is only going to help us by bringing more resources,” she had said, meaning that the government was looking to pare its stake.According to the Bill, the proposed legislation aims to remove the requirement that the Union government should hold not less than “51% of the equity capital in a specified insurer”.It also lays down the objectives of the Bill, including “greater private participation in the public sector insurance companies”.The government hopes to achieve its planned divestment target of ₹1.75 lakh crore for 2021-22 but the target has hit hurdles posed by the pandemicA panel headed by the finance minister had framed a policy for equity listing of the country’s largest life insurer LIC too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lok-sabha-clears-insurance-divestment-bill-101627905806646.html

I don’t want to hear this matter legally. But if the matter can be settled in mediation, please do that. Otherwise, we will have to send this matter to another bench,” the CJI told senior counsel Dushyant Dave, who appeared for the Andhra Pradesh government, which has filed the petition alleging Telangana government was depriving its people of legitimate share of Krishna water.Dave, on his part, commended the CJI’s views, adding he would have to speak to the competent authorities in the Andhra Pradesh government.Appearing for Telangana, senior advocate CS Vaidyanathan said the Centre has intervened and there was nothing left for the court to adjudicate. Justice Ramana then asked both the lawyers to persuade their client to iron out the issues amicably. “I can only wish for both of you to convince your governments to resolve it without the involvement of any third party,” the CJI said while fixing the matter on Wednesday.The Andhra government, in its petition, has complained that Telangana was refusing to follow decisions taken in the apex council constituted under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, directions of the Krishna River Management Board and those of the Centre.“More significantly, the state of Telangana is clearly in violation of a binding award, popularly known as ‘Bachwat award’ made on May 31, 1976, and express provisions of the 2014 Act whereby the state of Andhra Pradesh was bifurcated into Telangana and Andhra Pradesh,” stated the petition.The petition urged the SC to direct the Centre to take control of the common reservoirs of Srisailam, Nagarjunasagar, and also Pulichintala and operate the same as per the binding award and regulations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/resolve-krishna-water-dispute-amicably-sc-to-andhra-pradesh-telangana-govts-101627887505983.html
