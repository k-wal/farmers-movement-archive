The exams will go on till September 8 for Class 10, and September 16 for Class 12.The board used an alternate assessment system -- based on internal marks -- to score students of classes 10 and 12 after exams were cancelled this year due to the pandemic. However, the assessment scheme excluded private or patrachar students due to the unavailability of internal exam performances.The board will conduct three-hour examinations -- from 10.30am to 1.30pm -- in 19 subjects for Class 12, and 10 subjects for Class 10. According to a notification issued by the board on Tuesday, among those who are eligible to appear for these exams are students who are placed under compartment -- ie, failed in one or two subjects; who are not satisfied with their marks given through alternate assessment scheme and have requested improvement tests; whose result could not be prepared on the basis of new assessment criteria; and those who failed in their “sixth subject”. Besides, exams will be conducted for those enrolled under private and patrachar (correspondence) categories, and those who were placed under compartment category in 2019 and 2020. “The centres will be fixed keeping in view the Covid protocols and students will also be required to follow the same strictly. In each centre, a smaller number of candidates will be allotted to implement social distancing norms strictly,” said CBSE controller examination Sanyam Bhardwaj in the notification.Candidates who are already registered with the board will be able to appear in these exams and no fresh applications will be accepted. “Candidates will be informed about the date of downloading of the admit cards in due course through the CBSE website. In case of any discrepancy in the admit card, candidates/schools should contact the regional office of the board. It would be the responsibility of the candidate to download admit cards within the stipulated time schedule,” the notification added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cbse-offline-compartment-improvement-exams-from-aug-25-101628620104796.html

10-08-2021||Other||Ganga, Yamuna rise in Prayagraj, people fear repeat of past floods||: The Ganga and the Yamuna are flowing above the danger mark and many in the city are spending sleepless nights as they fear a repeat of previous floods of 2013 and 2019 or the worst ever flood of 1978. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has been pressed into action. The water level of both the rivers was increasing by around 3cm each hour and continuous showers have made things worse for the people. The Ganga at Phaphamau (as recorded at 6pm on Tuesday) was flowing one meter above the 84.74m danger mark, officials said. “At Chhatnag too, the Ganga level was 85.03m at 6pm and still rising,” officials said. Yamuna too had risen in the past 24 hours and its water level at 10pm (Monday) was 85.21m and had risen to 85.68m by Tuesday 6pm. “The entire Gaughat, Baradari of Balaughat, parts of Kareli area were all submerged in flood water that had entered ground floor of many houses located on the banks of the Ganga. Boats are being to supply necessary items in these localities,” locals said. Local residents of Bagraha, Daraganj, Salori, Beli gaon, Mehenduari goan, Ganga nagar, parts of Rajapur, Ashok Nagar said with flood water all around them, they were virtually cut off. National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams had been pressed into action, officials said. The local administration too along with NDRF teams were busy shifting people to safer places or providing necessary items to those stranded. “We are providing all the help needed by the flood affected people. Every two hours we take rounds of the flood-hit localities asking if anyone wants to move to safer places. For now, people have shifted to first floors of their houses,” NDRF, inspector Dinkar Tripathi who is leading the rescue team. One team of NDRF having 25 personnel with two boats have been pressed into service to help flood victims, many of whom now fear a repeat of floods like in 2013 or 2019 or the worst ever floods of 1978. “We still remember that localities like Mumforganj, Kydganj, Muttuganj, Alopibag, Khatghar, Bairana, Kareli etc were all flooded. Without the help of the then district magistrate Bhure Lal and the SSP Ajay Raj Sharma as well as Allahabad University, college and social organisations, the city could have suffered much more,” said Anand Dey, a resident of Kydganj. “The flood of 1978 was so intense that waves of river Yamuna were hitting the road of the bridge. The Ganga and Yamuna had inundated almost every locality of the city and people of Allahapur used to sit in the boats from the first floor of their houses,” said veteran city politician Shyam Krishna Pandey. “The then DM had not slept for four days and four nights continuously and assured that the relief items reach everyone affected by the floods,” he recalled. Congress MLA from city North, Anugrah Narayan Singh said, “The flood water from Ganga had crossed the present pump house of the Stanley road of Mumfordganj because of which the entire locality was inundated and boats were pressed into service”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ganga-yamuna-rise-in-prayagraj-people-fear-repeat-of-past-floods-101628619263817.html

10-08-2021||Noida||Priest stabbed inside Dasna temple premises, critical||Ghaziabad: Unidentified persons stabbed and critically injured a 50-year-old priest who was visiting the Dasna Devi Temple in Ghaziabad early Tuesday, police said. They said the victim, Nareshanand Swami from Bihar’s Samastipur, was sleeping at the temple when he was stabbed. He was rushed to the Yashoda Hospital where he is reported to be critical, police said. The temple authorities said the attack took place around 3.30am, despite the presence of police guards. “It seems that the assailants scaled the wall and entered the temple. They attacked the priest and he suffered injuries to his throat, abdomen and other parts of the body. We have four policemen posted within the temple complex, and more at the main entrance. It appears that the assailants came to attack our chief priest, Yati Narsimhanand Saraswati, but he was asleep in another room,” said Anil Yadav, one of the temple caretakers.Saraswati has been in news since March this year when a Muslim boy was allegedly roughed up on the temple premises when he purportedly went inside to drink water.Following this, Saraswati was given police security after he claimed a threat to his life. “Swami ji (the victim) arrived at the temple on August 7. Despite police security, this happened. I was asleep at the time of the incident and caretakers informed me about it later. Such attacks within a temple have taken place several times,” said Saraswati, the chief priest.CCTV cameras on the temple premises were not working at the time of the incident, said police. “We have our own CCTV cameras outside the temple and those are being scanned. We have a provincial armed constabulary deployed at the main gate, and another set of police guards inside and outside the temple,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural).“Four police guards provide security cover to the chief priest. He also has private bodyguards... An investigation in the case is underway,” the officer added.An attempt to murder case will be registered at the Masuri police station if a complaint is given, said police.“The priest was operated on, and is in the ICU,” said Dr Sangita Garg, Yashoda Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/priest-stabbed-inside-dasna-temple-premises-critical-101628618542456.html
10-08-2021||Noida||RRTS project: Ghaziabad development authority prepares framework for seven influence zones||The Ghaziabad development authority (GDA) has prepared a framework for seven influence zones and two special development areas (SDAs) along the 82-km route of regional rapid transit system (RRTS) high speed rail project that will link Delhi, Ghaziabad and Meerut and likely to be commissioned in 2025.Authority officials said that the influence zones will fall under a 1.5-km radius centred at each of the seven proposed RRTS stations in Ghaziabad — Sahibabad, Ghaziabad, Guldhar, Duhai, Muradnagar, Modinagar (South) and Modinagar (North). The SDAs will be adjacent plots at Guldhar (250 hectares) and Duhai (400 hectares) close to the Delhi Meerut Road and will form a larger township, they added.“Under the influence zone, we will allow mixed land use and commercial activities upon payment of impact fee for which rules are being framed. The idea behind the influence zones and SDAs is planned development,” said Asheesh Shivpuri, the authority’s chief architect and town planner (CATP).Influence zones will be used to enhance economic activity around areas by creating walkable communities and easier access to transport.“The influence zones and SDAs will be incorporated under the Master Plan 2031, which will come into effect next year. The two SDAs will have different zones for residential, commercial, industrial and other categories. Extra purchasable floor-area ratio (FAR) of 2 to 2.5 will also be available for different land uses,” the CATP added.The city’s Master Plan 2031 is also in its final stage and will incorporate different plans for Ghaziabad, Loni, Modinagar and Muradnagar.The proposals will now be sent to GDA board for approval and will later be notified by the state government, which had ordered for the proposals to plan development around RRTS stations, said officials.Under the RRTS project, which is pegged at ₹30,274 crore, the NCR Transport Corporation (NCRTC) is also developing the 17-km priority route from Sahibabad to Duhai where a major maintenance and parking depot for the RRTS trains is also coming up. This section is scheduled to open in March 2023, but officials said that they are hoping to complete it by the end of 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/rrts-project-ghaziabad-development-authority-prepares-framework-for-seven-influence-zones-101628618483874.html

More funding through the equity route is likely in the future.The YIAPL has taken possession of 1,334 hectares in Jewar where the airport is proposed to be built and has started work to mobilise resources. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath are likely to lay the foundation stone of the project but the date and venue are yet to be decided. Nial officials said that the ceremony could be held either this month or next.Christoph Schnellmann, CEO of YIAPL, said, “We are delighted to have signed the financing agreements with SBI and Nial to develop the airport. This marks the financial close (a technical term referring to the financing agreement) for the project, and we now eagerly look forward to the development of the airport in close collaboration with our partners, including Nial and SBI. This partnership will boost economic growth and employment in the state of Uttar Pradesh and will bolster the Indian aviation growth story”.The airport is scheduled to become operational by 2024 and officials are busy in preparations of foundation laying event scheduled ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/escrow-account-for-noida-international-airport-opened-101628618483179.html
10-08-2021||Noida||Man held for impersonating police officer, extortion||A 26-year-old man was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly impersonating a police officer and extorting money from roadside vendors in the city. According to police, on Sunday, a video was shared on social media, showing a man in police uniform extorting money from a roadside food vendor, consuming the items and refusing to pay the vendor. Following this, a probe was launched and the video was found to have originated from Sector 39 police jurisdiction. The suspect was identified as Saurav, a Jalaun native currently living at Chhalera village in Noida’s Sector 44. “He would dress up in police uniform, claim to be from the crime branch and then extort benefits from local vendors or try to intimidate them claiming to be a police officer,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1. Saurav had been extorting money in this manner for the past few months, police said, adding that he was nabbed from Chhalera. A khaki uniform set, two fake badges of UP Police and a motorcycle were recovered from him. Police said that he had recently purchased the motorcycle for ₹2,900 and changed its number plate to avoid getting caught. The suspect was booked for cheating and impersonation under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code at the Sector 39 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-held-for-impersonating-police-officer-extortion-101628618482446.html
10-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Only 4% leasehold properties find buyers||Similar to its previous attempts at selling leasehold properties, the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) has failed to get a positive response in its latest auction on Tuesday. Out of 189 leasehold properties on offer, it got buyers for just eight. The housing board had put up 38 dwelling units and 151 commercial properties on auction. In all, 15 e-bids were received for just five residential units. Their cumulative reserve price was ₹2.46 crore while the highest bids for these units totalled ₹2.77 crore. Three commercial units also found takers with five bids in all.“The board has received about 12.6% above the reserve price for residential units and about 6.5% above the reserve price for commercial units,” said Yashpal Garg, chief executive officer (CEO), CHB. Few takers for leasehold propertiesThe CHB, in the past four months, has conducted four e-auctions for its 121 freehold residential properties and has been able to sell 87, earning ₹70.59 crore. In the same period, excluding the Tuesday auction, it has been able to sell only two residential and nine commercial leasehold properties, earning ₹1.74 crore and ₹4.73 crore, respectively. The CHB is selling those properties on leasehold that are constructed on the land allotted by Chandigarh administration on leasehold basis. Similarly, the residential properties constructed on the land allotted on freehold basis are being sold on freehold. “In leasehold properties, the allottee is required to pay a yearly ground rent at the rate of 2.5% of the consideration amount for 33 years, followed by 3.75% for next 33 years and 5% for the subsequent 33 years. Since this is a substantial amount and ownership rights are inferior than in the case of freehold, people prefer to go for the latter properties,” said Garg. Also, the conversion of leasehold property to freehold is a costly affair. “The conversion charges for residential properties may range from 12% to 15% of the consideration amount. However, the conversion is not permitted in the case of commercial properties,” said the board CEO. UT urges Centre to allow conversion The Chandigarh administration has once again written to the Centre for its approval to allow conversion of leasehold properties to freehold in the case of commercial and industrial plots. Earlier, it has sought the approval in April this year. Around 70% commercial and industrial plots in the city are leasehold. The ownership rights are with the government agencies, such as the UT estate office, municipal corporation and the CHB. A large number of them are lying vacant as there are no takers for leasehold properties, and the administration is losing crores of rupees in revenue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-only-4-leasehold-properties-find-buyers-101628618363040.html

10-08-2021||Bangalore||HC asks Centre to respond to Karnataka’s request for 3.5m vaccine doses per week||The Karnataka high court on Tuesday directed the Centre to consider Karnataka’s request for 3.5 million doses of Covid vaccines per week in order to vaccinate all residents above 18 years of age within three months. The state told the court that the demand was based on its capability to vaccinate 500,000 eligible population daily. It stated that as of August 5, it had received a total of 27 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine including 24 million Covishield and 3.49 million Covaxin doses. It is also said that the state had administered 32 million doses as of August 5 to 49.7 million eligible recipients. A division bench of chief justice Abhay Oka and justice Aravind Kumar said, “If some state government is able to achieve the tall target, the Government of India shall welcome that and assist it.” The court suggested that, “There is no clarity on the efficacy of Covaxin and Covishiled, if the vaccines are effective for a limited period, necessary provisions shall be made for providing further doses in the action plan.” The court also directed the Centre to respond on this point. Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Tuesday gave a slew of directions to the state police including maintaining a tight vigil in the districts bordering neighbouring states where the Covid-19 cases are rising, having zero tolerance towards crime and crack down on drug cases while hailing the police force for “exemplary” work during a review meeting at the Vidhana Soudha. “Action has to be taken to prevent the possible Covid third wave. Precautions have to be taken at the border districts. Senior officers will have to work more responsibly. Inspection at the check posts in borders will be mandatory,” a statement issued by the chief minister’s office said. Revenue minister R Ashok, in charge of pandemic management in Bengaluru, said on Monday that tough measures will be imposed in the city to contain the virus after August 15. When quizzed whether this would mean weekend curfews and closure of economic activity, he said nothing can be ruled out and decisions will be taken based on the evolving situation. “The vaccination rate in the city is good, which we hope will reduce the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the city, even if the cases shoot up,” he said.Meanwhile, after clamping restrictions on people arriving from Kerala, the Chamarajanagar district administration made it mandatory for travellers from Tamil Nadu to furnish negative Covid-19 reports not older than 72 hours at the time of arrival from Sunday onwards. The decision comes in the wake of fresh reports of rise in Covid cases in the neighbouring state. The district administration has intensified screening of people at Punajanur checkpost, Naal Road near Ardhanipura and the checkpost at Palar in Hanur taluk on the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/hc-asks-centre-to-respond-to-karnataka-s-request-for-3-5m-vaccine-doses-per-week-101628617403092.html
10-08-2021||Noida||Warm, dry days in Noida till Aug 15, predicts IMD||The ‘break’ in monsoon is likely to prevail for the next few days in Noida and adjoining areas and the in the region is likely to be warm and dry till then, said the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Tuesday. Weather analysts said the cool moist easterly winds have been replaced by warm dry westerly that will cause a spike in mercury levels, although it will reduce humidity, at least till August 15.Officials said that the monsoon trough line, a low pressure line that oscillates north to south and bring rains, has shifted to the Himalayan foothills.“It will stay there for a few days and cause heavy rains there, but lead to a ‘break monsoon’ or weak monsoon condition. Winds also have changed their direction, so the moisture content may drop as well. The break monsoon usually happens every season so there’s nothing unusual about it,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD“The monsoon axis is likely to return after August 15. So the earliest that region could see the rain will be around August 15,”said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.On Tuesday, the IMD recorded maximum and minimum temperatures of 33.6°C and 26.3°C, respectively, for Noida. On Tuesday this was 33.4°C and 25.1°C, respectively. The humidity oscillated between 89 to 57%.“On Wednesday, the maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to hover around 36 and 27 degrees Celsius,” said an official from IMD.At Safdarjung monitoring station, considered average for the national Capital region, the maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded at 35.8°C, one degree above the season’s average, and 25°C, two degrees below the season’s average.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/warm-dry-days-in-noida-till-aug-15-predicts-imd-101628617042232.html

Officials said that the motive behind the dedicated zones is to make sure that the squatters are discouraged from operating at a public space at their will, thereby causing nuisance.The authority has earmarked the space for vending zones in sectors 36, Delta 2, Alpha 2, Beta 2 and Beta 1, the officials said. In these vending zones, a total of 205 platforms will be constructed where street vendors can station their carts, they said. “We will select an agency in the next two months for the vending zone project. We aim to ready the vending zones and the platforms by end of this year. The platforms will be allotted to licensed vendors via lucky draw next year. We want to remove all squatters from footpaths, markets and other public spaces,” said Deep Chand, additional chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority.The city at present has about 1,000 street vendors, the officials said, adding that the vendors will have to register themselves with the authority to be eligible for the platforms. The authority will develop 40 platforms in Sector 36, 45 in Delta 2, 35 in Alpha 2, 45 in Beta 2 and 40 in Beta 1. The authority will also build toilets and create a parking space at each of the five sites, the officials said.“We have started preparation of estimates for this project and soon a tender will be issued to select an agency,” said Chand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-authority-to-make-five-dedicated-vending-zones-for-street-vendors-101628616802223.html

10-08-2021||Noida||Noida: 40K defaulters set to lose power||After a series of reliefs following the Covid-19 outbreak in Gautam Budh Nagar district, the power distribution company (discom) in Noida – Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) – has resumed disconnecting supply to defaulters. From Sunday, it began taking action against nearly 40,000 consumers who owed it a total of ₹200 crore. In May, the PVVNL had decided to suspend the drive after state energy minister Shrikant Sharma intervened and told them to put it off till the Covid crisis had subsided. PVVNL (Noida) chief engineer Virendra Nath Singh said that the dues had been pending since the last one year. “We had already issued several notices to these consumers and yet they have not made any payment. Out of these 40,000 defaulters, over 1,500 have outstanding bills ranging between ₹1 lakh and ₹20 lakh each. Similarly, we have 12,000 others who have not cleared their dues ranging from ₹50,000 to ₹99,000, while the rest owe us between ₹10,000 and ₹49,000,” he said. Singh said that supply to nearly 500 consumers had been disconnected since Sunday. “Since we began the process, over 300 defaulters have cleared their dues amounting to nearly ₹35 lakh so far,” he said. PVVNL has around 325,000 consumers in Gautam Budh Nagar district, which gives it ₹300 crore every month. “Earlier, we began a disconnection drive in December. On instruction from the energy minister, we suspended it in May. If we keep providing power to these defaulters, the discom will be under heavy loss,” he said. The chief engineer further said that the discom will accept only offline applications for converting single-point electricity connections in high-rises to multi-point connections. “We got six complaints that the software we deployed to digitise application process was faulty. It resulted in debiting the amount without processing the application properly. We’ve decided to go on with offline applications till the software is fixed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-40k-defaulters-set-to-lose-power-101628616562287.html
10-08-2021||Other||PM: People’s lives could have been bettered decades ago||Lucknow: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday targeted the non-BJP governments that ruled the country since independence, saying certain conditions and situations could have been changed decades ago to make the lives of people better. “We are entering the 75th year of independence and when we see the progress made in the past seven and a half decades, we realise that certain conditions and situations could have been changed long ago,” said Modi after launching Ujjwala 2.0 (Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana), distributing LPG connections at a programme in Mahoba in Uttar Peadesh’s Bundelkhand region via videoconferencing. Union minister for petroleum and natural gas Hardeep Singh Puri and chief minister Yogi Adityanath also attended the programme. Yogi made a token distribution of LPG connections on the occasion. Modi, who interacted with Ujjwala scheme’s five beneficiaries, including one from Gorakhpur, used the occasion to point out how his government had worked to fulfill basic needs of the people. He said the people had to wait for decades to get their basic needs fulfilled and the women, especially the poor, had to suffer the most. “How can a family and society progress and realise big dreams if it has to struggle for basic needs?” he asked. “Our sisters and daughters will be able to contribute to nation building only if their problems of kitchen and home are taken care of. We have worked in mission mode to resolve such issues,” he said. He referred to the forthcoming festival of Raksha Bandhan to connect with the women, saying he was delighted to get blessings of his sisters well in advance. He also used the occasion to connect with the people of Bundelkhand, saying Ujjwala 2.0 was being launched from Mahoba, the land of the brave, and said the region was also the land of Major Dhyanchand after whom the highest award for sportspersons had been named to inspire lakhs of youths. He said by their exemplary performance at the Tokyo Olympics, the country’s sportspersons had given an indication about the future in the sports sector. Giving statistical details about achievements of his government, he said under the first phase of Ujjwala scheme, LPG connections had been given to 8 crore women from the poor and deprived sections of society. He said India was close to achieving 100 per cent coverage on gas connection front and the number of gas connections given in the past seven years was higher than the total connections in the country till 2014. He said a self-declaration of address would work to get an LPG connection in other states under Ujjwala 2.0, which would help migrant workers and added that efforts were also being made to supply piped natural gas. The Prime Minister said expeditious work was being done to give PNG connections in UP and north-eastern states. A target to give PNG connections to 21 lakh households in over 50 districts of Uttar Pradesh had been set in the first phase. Efforts were also being made to boost use of CNG for transportation, he said. The World Biofuel Day on Tuesday was a reminder about the targets on clean energy front, the PM said and added that India was close to achieving the target of 10 per cent blending of ethanol in petrol and would achieve 20 per cent blending in coming years. Vehicles would use 100 per cent ethanol in future. Modi said Uttar Pradesh’s farmers would be benefitted the most with the option of making ethanol from sugarcane. Ethanol of about ₹7 lakh crore was bought from producers last year, he said. A number of units linked to ethanol and biofuel had come up in the state and plants were being set up in 70 districts to make compressed biogas. He said three big complexes were also coming up to make biogas from ‘parali’ (stubble), including two in Badaun and Gorakhpur in UP and another in Bhatinda in Punjab. Another scheme Goverdhan Yojana was about making biogas from cow dung. Lauding the Yogi government, Modi said it had set up a large number of gaushalas (cow shelters) and efforts had also been made to protect crops of farmers. ‘LPG connection has made life easy’ As Prime Minister Narendra Modi interacted with beneficiaries of Ujjwala scheme, Kiran Devi from Gorakhpur informed how an LPG connection had made her life easy and requested him for financial help. “Our money is stuck up due to lockdown. I request you for some help,” Kiran Devi told the Prime Minister.She was among five beneficiaries of Ujjwala scheme from different states with whom the PM virtually interacted at the programme organized in Mahoba to launch Ujjawala 2.0. The PM, however, probably did not hear her and asked her more about benefits of Ujjwala scheme and whether or not she and the others were getting benefits of scheme of free ration distribution. She had joined the interaction with her daughter and wished the PM a long life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pm-people-s-lives-could-have-been-bettered-decades-ago-101628616324607.html

10-08-2021||Gurugram||Admin develops calculator to promote rainwater harvesting||The district authorities have developed a rainwater harvesting (RWH) calculator, which will provide design specifications and a list of vendors, to encourage conservation of rainwater in the city. GuruJal society, an integrated water management initiative of the district administration, has developed the calculator based on the records of rainfall for the past 30 years in the district. Osho Kalia, a senior member of the GuruJal team, said, “Gurugram has immense potential for groundwater recharge. In order to promote water conservation, we have developed an RWH calculator based on the records of rainfall for the past 30 years in the district. The calculator provides design specifications and a list of vendors that can be accessed through the website that may build the suggested designs.” The portal allows users to input specifications of their premises, location and the total area available to harvest rainwater, based on which the calculations are made. According to the records of the Central Ground Water Board, of the 1,258 square kilometre area of the district, the total area available for artificial recharge and augmentation is 1,190 square kilometres. Recently, a report filed by GuruJal stated that the majority of the 84 rainwater harvesting units checked by the district administration in July, after the city received intermittent spells of rainfall, were choked. According to the report, rainwater harvesting units in areas under nine residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) were checked, with 54% of 84 drains found dirty and choked. Further, the report stated that 33% of the drains need to be cleaned and 13% are in good condition. The inspections were conducted on July 15 and 22. The district administration has been trying to promote rainwater harvesting in the district to increase the groundwater level. In July, Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, during a statewide review meeting of work done under Jal Shakti Abhiyan, had said that a target of installing 2,106 rainwater harvesting structures is set for the district, with 405 structures already having been built.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/admin-develops-calculator-to-promote-rainwater-harvesting-101628616142710.html

However, officials denied that it was leachate and said that it was contaminated rainwater, with an inspection scheduled for Wednesday in this regard.Vaishali Chandra, a city-based environmentalist who visited the site on Tuesday, said that leachate was spilling out, with streams flowing into the adjacent forest area and towards Bandhwari village. “Once again leachate water is being discharged from Bandhwari landfill into the surrounding Aravalli forests, harming both the wildlife and life of local villagers. So much leachate is being discharged that a pondage has formed near the landfill. Streams carrying this dirty water was flowing at least 200-300 metres inside the forest area,” said Chandra. Officials of Ecogreen Energy, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram’s concessionaire for waste management at Bandhwari landfill, denied the allegation and said that it was dirty water. Sanjeev Sharma, the spokesperson for Ecogreen Energy, said, “There was no leachate spill from the landfill on Tuesday. There was contaminated water (rainwater mixed with fresh waste) that accumulated on the ground, but no leachate. As the city received heavy rain in the past few days, it is that very water which is flowing out from the waste.”Meanwhile, taking note of the situation, officials from the regional office of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) said that they will conduct an inspection on Wednesday. Kuldeep Singh, regional officer for Gurugram North, HSPCB, said, “We have received a complaint regarding spilling of leachate from the landfill and a team will visit the site on Wednesday morning for an inspection. After the inspection, necessary action will be taken.” The Bandhwari landfill receives around 2,000 tonnes of waste every day from Gurugram and Faridabad. Municipal solid waste from both these cities is being dumped at the site since 2015. As per a report by the Central Pollution Control Board submitted to the National Green Tribunal in September 2020, approximately 3.1 million tonnes of waste is dumped at the site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/bandhwari-landfill-citizens-allege-leachate-spill-officials-say-it-is-rainwater-101628616086290.html

The department also sought details of electricity connections to residences, questioning on what basis the same was issued.Around 135 flats have been constructed in violation of rules and without permission in Sai Lane Colony of Old Gurugram, while over 100 flats have been built on agricultural land in Sector 65, DTCP officials said. RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement), said that while notices have already been served to owners, developers and property dealers, they are seeking details from the revenue department regarding the registry of these illegal properties. “We have also sought details from the power utility, to find out on what basis electricity connections were released to these flats owners,” he said. “We have sought details of the property deeds registered by the revenue department and also an explanation as to how these properties could be registered as these were developed without CLU [change of land use] permissions or licence from DTCP. As per Haryana urban development rules, clearance has to be obtained from the department for registration of property smaller than two acres in controlled areas,” said Bhath. A letter sent to the revenue and electricity departments states, ”After perusal of revenue documents, it has been found that unauthorised colony has been carved out in the revenue estate of Gurugram village without any permission from competent authority and raised unauthorised construction of independent flats/floors and sold to individuals and sale deeds executed.”Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner (enforcement), said action was initiated against the colony developed in Sector 65 last year and a number of flats were sealed and constructed stopped. “A case has also been registered against the property developers and landowners who were engaged in the sale of such flats.

10-08-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19: Hospitals directed to constitute committee to monitor oxygen use||The district health department on Tuesday directed all private hospitals having at least 50 beds to set up an oxygen audit committee for monitoring the current oxygen requirement, its usage and wastage, in the backdrop of the state government extending the deadline for installation of Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen generating plants in hospitals to December 2021.The audit committee will have to provide the details on oxygen supply and consumption, the status of setting up oxygen PSA plant and the total number of oxygen-supported beds by August 20. Officials said that this will help keep a tab on the medical oxygen situation in the district and avoid a repeat of the circumstances experienced during the second Covid-19 wave in April and May.In an order issued by the health department, hospitals will form a five-member committee comprising a medical superintendent, anaesthetist, physician, nurse and technical support staff or oxygen supervisor. Also, each hospital will have to designate a nurse specifically for monitoring oxygen. “The committee will ensure optimal usage of oxygen, prevent wastage due to leakage and adoption of good oxygen therapy practices,” an order in this regard stated.Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said, “The details submitted by hospitals will help us in estimating and making future projections on the requirement of oxygen supply if there is a surge in coronavirus infection in the coming months. It will help us in keeping a tab on the wastage of oxygen and devise ways it can be prevented. The next course of action will be decided only after the details are submitted by August 20 and analysed by our team.”In April and May, various private hospitals of the city grappled with a lack of liquid oxygen supply due to a sharp rise in coronavirus cases. Refilling cylinders became an impossible task due to the short supply of oxygen, as the demand increased from around 25 metric tonnes (MT) a day to almost 48 MT in a short span. Currently, the daily requirement of oxygen across the district is 10-12 MT, as per the rough estimates made by the health department. In May, hospitals having a capacity of at least 50 beds were directed to install PSA oxygen plants. Currently, of 43 hospitals, only five private hospitals have fully functional oxygen plants, according to the health department data. The remaining hospitals are in the process of installing it and are likely to set it up in August and September. Dr Vikram Singh, director of Aarvy Hospital in Civil Lines, said, “The PSA oxygen plant set up in the facility got functional on Tuesday. It is sufficient to refill 130 D-type oxygen cylinders. The daily requirement during the second Covid-19 wave was around 92-100 cylinders. Taking that requirement into consideration, the plant is sufficient enough for 70 oxygen beds in the hospitals,” said Singh. He said that they would be submitting the details based on the format shared by the health department. It includes details like the total number of oxygen supported beds for adults and children along with the intensive care unit (ICU) and paediatric ICUs with and without a ventilator support system. According to Yadav, Civil Hospital in Sector 10 also has a sufficient supply of medical oxygen due to the installation of a 750 LPM (litres per minute) oxygen plant. Additionally, a 1,000-LPM plant is likely to be installed by this week. Besides these, a 1.2 MT liquid oxygen tank is also available with the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-hospitals-directed-to-constitute-committee-to-monitor-oxygen-use-101628616082798.html
10-08-2021||Noida||Saturdays to be reserved for second Covid dose in Uttar Pradesh||In order to increase the number of individuals fully vaccinated against Covid-19, the Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday said that all Saturdays starting August 14 will be reserved only for those needing their second shot of either Covishield, Covaxin or Sputnik V — the three vaccines that are in use in the state at the moment. The order will be applicable at both government and private vaccination centres.The vaccine coverage was expanded to all adults on May 1 and the first dose for most people was the Covishield vaccine, which was more in supply. With a three-month waiting period for the vaccine, it was expected that the number of people lining up for their second dose would increase from August. “It (the decision) is because many people whose are scheduled to get their second dose have not appeared at the vaccination centres in time. It may be because they face issues with regard to booking their slots. So, we have reserved Saturdays only for them. The other weekdays from Monday to Friday will be used for administration of both the first and the second dose,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health). There are no vaccinations at government centres on Sunday. “From 9am to 11am on Saturday, the preference will be for those who booked their second dose by way of booking online. Thereafter, (it’ll be opened to) anyone needing the second dose who wish to walk-in and get the jab.”The state government also issue a government order to this effect adding that the routine immunisation for children will be unaffected on Saturdays. According to the figures from the Co-Win portal, Uttar Pradesh till 6pm on Tuesday had administered nearly 55 million doses of which the first dose was 46 million first dose and just over 8.6 million were second doses. On Monday, ACS Prasad said that the government wished to expedite the coverage of the second dose and special focus is being given for the purpose. “We have received directions about expediting of the second dose coverage and we will devote Saturday for second dose beneficiaries. The second dose for the age group 18-45 years is also due now and we are making efforts to cater to them with maximum coverage,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar. The district’s second dose coverage was about 19% (333,610 second doses) of the total 1.7 million doses administered so far, as per the Co-Win portal till 6pm on Tuesday. Likewise, the coverage for Ghaziabad district was about 18% (299,758 second doses) out of the total 1.6 million administered. “We are also encouraging and making calls to beneficiaries through our Integrated Covid Command and Control Centre. Further, even on regular days we have reserved 60% doses for beneficiaries who need to get their second dose,” said Dr GP Mathuria, nodal officer for Covid vaccination in Ghaziabad. The government order also said that special vaccination centres will be opened at the social welfare department for vaccination of destitute, beggars and vagabonds. Likewise, similar centres will be opened up at the offices of basic education officer and district inspector of schools for vaccination of teachers, school staff, bus drivers and cleaners. It is also directed that such centres should come up latest by August 11.

Most of these dogs are diseased, have rashes and keep vomiting on the road. They also make horrible and strange sound in the night,” said Vivek Shesh, a resident of Aundh.He also hinted that part of rising problem is because animal lovers feed the strays.“There is no long-term plan to address the stray dog menace. They keep proliferating even though PMC has a huge budget for sterilisation,” said Deepak Gogate.In June, PMC had announced 15 vans to catch strays and had set up seven sterilisation centres in the city.“Areas on the outskirts of the city limits or cremation grounds close to the road are the worst. A pack of dogs will often rush towards you or a passing vehicle, which is very dangerous. This is happening very often in the Hinjewadi area,” said Ravindra Sinha, a resident.“PMC has one dog van while we have help from NGOs who help us with sterilisation areas,” said Mukadam Vishal Kamble, PMC Zone 2. “The sterilising of strays is done throughout the city, but the population of dogs varies,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/stray-dogs-on-the-increase-as-residents-allege-civic-sterlisation-plan-not-happening-101628614942011.html

10-08-2021||Kolkata||Eyes on 2023, TMC wants to revamp Tripura unit by Dec 31||Days after three Trinamool Congress (TMC) youth front leaders were allegedly attacked by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers in Tripura and arrested by the local police for violating pandemic restrictions, West Bengal’s ruling party has decided to revamp its organisation in the north-eastern state by December 31. The deadline has been set by TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee who visited Tripura twice last week, a senior party leader told HT on condition of anonymity. The youth leaders were sent to carry out organizational work. I-Pac, the company formed by election strategist Prashant Kishor, is collecting data on the ground. “Abhishek Banerjee is in charge of the mission that aims to overthrow the BJP government in the next assembly polls in 2023. Right now, we have no organizational committee in Tripura. Banerjee wants new committees to be set up down to the polling booth level by December 31. If this target is achieved, we will have enough time to pose a challenge to the BJP,” the TMC leader quoted above said. To ensure that this work continues without break, Banerjee has created a travel roster for six TMC leaders from Bengal. They are education minister Bratya Basu, law minister Moloy Ghatak, Lok Sabha member Kakali Ghosh Dastidar, state general secretary Kunal Ghosh, TMC’s trade union front president Ritabrata Banerjee and former legislator Samir Chakraborty. Each one of them will spend three days in Tripura and leave the state when the next person marked in the roster arrives. “People of Tripura want a change. We have felt their pulse,” Kunal Ghosh, who went to Agartala on Sunday, said. Mukul Roy, who left the BJP and returned to the ruling party on June 11, played the key role in building the TMC’s base in Tripura by breaking the Congress. “Roy has not been given any responsibility yet because of his age and health condition,” said a third TMC leader who did not want to be named. The Tripura assembly has 60 seats, of which, 43 are in control of BJP and its allies. Under Roy’s leadership, Sudip Roy Barman, who was leader of the Opposition in the Tripura assembly during the Left regime and who is the son of former Congress chief minister Samir Ranjan Barman, left the Congress and joined TMC in 2016 along with five MLAs. Barman joined the BJP with his followers in 2017 when Mukul Roy switched sides. After Roy joined the BJP, the TMC made Sabyasachi Dutta, the former mayor of Salt Lake township in the eastern outskirts of Kolkata, in charge of the Tripura unit, but he, too, joined the BJP after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. After this, Ashish Lal Singh, the son of Tripura’s first chief minister Sachindra Lal Singh, remained the TMC’s only face in Tripura. BJP leaders in Tripura said the TMC is aware that it cannot win the state polls and its real aim is to secure 6% votes ,a criteria for being recognised as a national party. Though the TMC is recognised as a national party because of its seat share in the Lok Sabha, its presence is negligible outside Bengal. In June, Abhishek Banerjee announced that the TMC will contest assembly polls in other states and take the BJP head on. “The TMC tried twice to win elections in Tripura but failed. On both occasions, TMC leaders arrived 12 or 18 months before the polls and left after the results were announced. They are following the same routine. But this time around, people are questioning their intentions, the staged attack and the drama surrounding it,” said Subrata Chakraborty, the BJP spokesperson in Tripura. “This is a democratic state where anybody is free to come and go. However, people have taken note of the social media videos in which the TMC youth leaders can be seen using slang language against chief minister Biplab Deb,” said Chakraborty. Leaders of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), who ruled Tripura from 1978 to 1988 and again from 1993 to 2018, have condemned the attack on the youth TMC leaders. “The CPI(M) may tacitly support the TMC but it won’t help them. The Left parties were completely wiped out in the autonomous district council elections,” said Chakraborty. CPI(M)’s Tripura state secretary Gautam Das said, “There is no question of helping the TMC. We have only said that every party has the right to carry out organizational work because the Constitution guarantees that freedom. The BJP is running a dictatorial government in Tripura. No other party is allowed to work. Our workers were murdered after the state polls. Many party offices were burnt down.” Kolkata-based political science professor Udayan Bandopadhyay said, “The TMC can make a breakthrough in Tripura only if there is an exodus from the BJP because Biplab Deb came to power using the anti-incumbency factor against the CPI(M).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/eyes-on-2023-tmc-wants-to-revamp-tripura-unit-by-dec-31-101628614763393.html

The outbreak, which has infected around 230 people, also left a 30-year-old man and a three-year-old girl dead in the past three days. Meanwhile, the civic authorities have found the source of contamination of water at Ekta Vihar and fixed it. Fresh supply of water has been resumed. Girish Verma, executive officer, municipal council, Zirakpur, said: “There are sewage pipes passing near the water tank in Ekta Vihar. Around eight years back, there was a leakage in the sewage pipe and the contractor, instead of replacing the pipe, had used a rubber pipe to plug the leakage.” The present contamination started as both sewage and water pipes developed a leakage, he said.Mohali civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur said medical camps were being held in all the three colonies and the health department was keeping a close eye on the situation. She said medical teams and ambulances have been stationed in the area and free medicines are being provided to the affected people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/diarrhoea-outbreak-55-more-cases-source-of-contamination-found-plugged-101628614762019.html

As per the study the presence of Sars-Cov-2 RNA was demonstrated in the faeces of Covid-19 patients, suggesting the possibility of transmission via the faecal-oral route.As per the study, a family that had four members was admitted for Covid-19 treatment. The index case was a 37-year old male healthcare worker in the Covid-19 ward. He was living with his wife (34-years old) and two children (8- and 6-years old). The index patient showed fever, nasal discharge and generalised weakness at the onset of symptoms. He was admitted to hospital and diagnosed with Covid-19 by real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR). Stool and urine samples were collected to check if the virus could be detected in specimens from non-respiratory sites. Additional stool samples were collected from the index case on days number 14, 21, 32, 40, 48 and 55, after the onset of symptoms, to determine the duration of excretion of the virus in faeces.The index patient continued to excrete the virus in his stool until 48 days, despite throat/nasal swabs showing negative Viral RNA. A rather surprising finding from the study was detection of viral RNA from the faecal specimens of patients, though none of them had diarrhoea as part of their symptoms.Dr Sampada Patwardhan, associated with Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital said, “The study was basically by NIV to find transmission pattern of four patients in a family cluster from Pune city. All four members presented with different clinical features after being infected with Covid-19. The index case contracted this infection from the hospital and subsequently infected other members in the family. When we say that the virus is present in the faeces and that it could spread through the faecal-oral method it means that the aerosolation of the faeces either through open defecation, flushing of the toilet and sharing of public toilets in huge clusters, could prove to be means of transmission.”Dr Patwardhan further explained, “The virus is attached to receptors heavily present in the respiratory system, which is why initial symptoms are related to respiration. However, receptors are also heavily present in the large intestine and so symptoms like diarrhoea are also prevalent. We are not denying that the family could not have been infected from the index person via other methods, but the transmission of the virus through faeces is also probable.”The study has been authored by Sujata Ranshing, Enteric Viruses Group, ICMR-National Institute of Virolog; Mallika Lavania, National Influenza Centre; Varsha Potdar, (NIV); Dr Sampada Patwardhan, department of microbiology, Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital; Dr Parikshit S Prayag, infectious disease, Deenanath Mangeshkar; Dr Sameer Jog, critical care centre, Deenanath Mangeshkar; Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director, Deenanath Mangeshkar; Dr Pradeep Sawant, Dr Manohar Shinde and Dr Nutan Chavan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/faeces-potential-source-for-transmission-of-covid-19-niv-study-101628613981990.html

Delivering its verdict on a writ petition against the published result, the single bench on this June 7 quashed the merit list of the sixth civil services examination through which 326 candidates were appointed in different cadre jobs. The HC at the time also directed the commission to issue a fresh merit list after making the required corrections within eight weeks. The HC bench earlier found that the JPSC committed error by adding marks obtained by the candidates in mains qualifying papers (Hindi and English) to prepare the final merit list. It also directed the state government to make cadre allocation of the successful candidates as per the new revised list within next four weeks. However, the verdict was challenged by several successful candidates, pleading that the declared result was as per the exam rules published in the advertisement issued by the JPSC. On Tuesday, the division bench of chief justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Sujit Narayan Prasad ordered status quo in the matter. “After hearing our argument, the court has ordered a status quo till the next hearing on September 28. The court has also ordered to send notices to all concerned, including those who filed writ petition challenging the result, besides the state government and the JPSC,” said Sandeep Gadodia, counsel for successful candidate Shishir Tigga and 45 others. Senior Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan and senior counsel Anil Sinha also argued on behalf of other applicants, who filed separate petitions. Gadodia said they argued that the merit list was prepared as per the published job advertisement. “The advertisement clearly mentioned that the total marks of the mains papers adds to 1,050, including the first paper (Hindi and English). Accordingly, marks of paper one was added while preparing the merit list,” he said. The counsel further argued that even if there was any ambiguity in the advertisement, the benefits went to all candidates, including the unsuccessful ones. “The result has been published as per the advertisement. Moreover, it’s not as if the marks of paper one (Hindi and English) were only added to the marks of the successful candidates,” said Gadodia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jpsc-exam-result-hc-division-bench-orders-status-quo-interim-relief-to-326-candidates-101628613922816.html

Two candidates could not be analysed. The Rashtriya Janata Dal was the party with the highest number tainted but winning candidates ( 73%), followed by BJP (64%), JD-U (47%) and Congress (17%).The Election Commission (EC) guidelines, issued in the light of the Supreme Court order, required candidates and parties to mandatorily publicise pending criminal cases through advertisements in a local and a national newspaper, besides official social media platforms of the political party, and explain reasons for fielding them. However, the compliance was low and the EC served show cause notices to over 100 such candidates and later issued a general notice for all to comply, failing which it was reported as violation, an EC official had said soon after election.Former advocate general PK Shahi said the apex court order could lead to compliance of its order and EC guidelines in future. “The court has taken the extreme step of imposing fine because its orders were not being followed. The objective is to let the voters know which candidate is facing what kind of cases prior to election so that they could make an informed choice. Now disclosure will be compulsory,” he said. “This a welcome step, and should ensure compliance in future. The political parties will have to take it seriously. Compliance to EC guidelines remained disappointing even though the information is required to be furnished within 48 hours of the selection of candidates and not less than two weeks before the first date for filing of nomination,” said political analyst Prof NK Choudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/experts-hail-sc-order-on-tainted-lawmakers-101628613202971.html

The two-time MP from Jamui, who has been allotted a house in North Avenue, has always lived at 12 Janpath along with his father and mother . Chirag wasn’t available for comment, but his aides said he has sought some time to vacate the house. A LJP leader close to Chirag, not willing to be quoted, confirmed that a fresh notice had been sent to him again, but he wants to stay there till the first death anniversary of his father. The LJP leader said Chirag had a meeting with the union urban development minister Hardeep Puri in this regard. The eviction notice comes as a fresh blow for Chirag, who was upstaged in his party by his uncle and Lok Sabha MP Pashupati Kumar Paras a few months back. Paras, who enjoys support of five of the six MPs of the party, declared himself as leader of the real LJP and was included in the union cabinet recently.LJP sources said that after the induction of over 40 new faces in union cabinet, houses are being allotted to all of them.

The two-lane bridge would also improve Bihar’s connectivity with Uttar Pradesh upon its completion, likely in March 2024.A proposal to ease traffic congestion on the approach to JP Setu with the national highway 119 (Vaishali-Chapra stretch) by widening it and strengthening the service road also got the cabinet nod. A sum of ₹598 crore would be spent on building the approach roads, which also include rail over bridges and culverts. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/cabinet-meet-decks-cleared-for-new-municipal-building-tribunal-101628612903666.html

The standing committee of the civic body on Tuesday gave its permission to continue the contract with SWaCH. SWaCH is a cooperative model that emerged in Pune city, and has garnered appreciation from all over the country.Hemant Rasne, chairman of the standing committee of the PMC, said, “We gave our nod for the SWaCH proposal. Earlier, social leader Baba Adhav agitated for it and even held a meeting with corporation officials.” Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “We put forth a clear proposal in front of the standing committee and got a nod on Tuesday.”With the earlier agreement between the PMC and SWaCH having ended, the corporation was initially planning to appoint a private contractor for door-to-door garbage collection but later decided to keep that on hold. In 2005, a pilot programme implemented by the Kagad Kach Patra Kashtakari Panchayat in collaboration with the department of adult education of the SNDT Women’s University enabled 1,500 waste-pickers to become service providers and collect door-to-door waste from households in Pune city. This improved their working conditions and livelihoods considerably while also bridging the gap between the households and the municipal waste collection service. The pilot became operational in 2006 and SWaCH was formed in 2007.In 2008, the PMC signed a five-year agreement with SWaCH for decentralised door-to-door waste collection from households, shops, offices and small commercial establishments, renewing it in 2016. The members of the cooperative work in pairs and are in charge of door-to-door waste collection for about 200 to 250 households. The waste-pickers collect segregated waste (separated as wet or organic and dry namely, plastic, glass, paper etc.) from households and commercial establishments. They further separate it as recyclables to be sold in the recycling market and non-recyclables to be dropped off at feeder points. The model is energy-efficient and benefits the environment as SWaCH waste-pickers recycle the waste and reduce the quantity of waste sent to landfills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-gives-nod-to-swach-contract-101628612842003.html

The CM then directed his officials to upload the work done by the health department on the social media, by putting it in perspective of what the situation was in 2005 (when he took over the reins of Bihar) and the progress the state had made now.Kumar also asked his officials to scale up Covid-19 tests to 2 lakh per day. He said from performing 20,000 Covid-19 tests a day during the first wave, the state had crossed 1.70 lakh tests in a single day.The state had administered 2.74 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine by August 8 against a target to inoculate an adult population of 7.22 crore by December.Health minister Mangal Pandey, referring to the oxygen crisis during the second wave of the pandemic, said 122 oxygen generation plants would be ready by August 31 at different hospitals and subdivisional hospitals in the state. Deputy chief ministers Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi also spoke on the occasion.Among the projects the CM graced through virtual mode were the foundation stone laying ceremony of a 1,200-bed and a 500-bed hospital at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), inauguration of a state cancer institute at the institute, eSanjeevani OPD (tele-consultation with doctor from home) and eSanjeevani.in module (visiting any of the 2,319 designated health sub-centres and talking through virtual mode to medical officers and getting medicines prescribed by them).Commending the role of “Jeevika didis” (women’s self-help group), the CM also extended “Didi Ki Rasoi” (canteen for in-patients) to 32 other district and subdivisional hospitals in the state. The canteens aim to provide quality and nutritious breakfast and meals to in-patients for a package rate of ₹150 per day per patient, and the government bears its cost. The service was earlier confined to seven district hospitals and one subdivisional hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/nitish-inaugurates-projects-worth-2-7k-cr-takes-a-jibe-at-states-high-on-publicity-101628612482667.html

The snakes are currently under the care and treatment of Wildlife SOS, a non government organization for animal welfare. A total of 16 cobras, 4 Indian rat snakes, and four common sand boas were rescued from snake charmers from outside Kailash, Balkeshwar, Mankameshwar, Rajeshwar and Rawli temples and transferred to the Wildlife SOS rescue facility. All snakes were found to be starved and dehydrated. The mouth of a harmless, non-venomous rat snake had been stitched. Veterinarians from Wildlife SOS immediately removed the stitches from the rat snake’s mouth and hydrated all snakes as the first step. The NGO is treating and observing all reptile, determining if they are fit enough to be released into their natural habitat. The month of ‘Shravan’ or ‘Sawan’ which started on July 25, is highly auspicious for devotees of Lord Shiva, also known as the Lord of the Snakes. The Mondays of this month, known as “Shravan Somvar,” have special significance, with devotees observing fast on the day or flocking to temples to receive blessings. Taking advantage of Lord Shiva’s association with snakes and people’s innocent reverence, snake charmers (saperas) often lure devotees with snake displays and promises of blessings. With the intent of gaining alms, some snake charmers even encourage devotees to offer milk to the snake, which is detrimental to the reptile’s health. Wildlife SOS and the forest department urged tourists and locals to steer clear of snake charmers and discourage exploitation of snakes for display or entertainment. Snake charming promoted the illegal possession of protected wildlife species and was an illegal offence under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, they said. Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder & CEO of Wildlife SOS, said, “These snakes are kept in the most dreadful conditions and the gruesome reality of snake charming needs to be exposed. Snakes are injured and mutilated to the point that they often can’t return to their natural habitat. Our team is dedicated to ensuring that these snakes receive all the medical attention needed.” Dr. Ilayaraja, deputy director veterinary services, Wildlife SOS, said, “The rat snake with the stitched mouth was exhibiting aggressive behaviour due to pain. We carefully removed the stitches and no major bleeding or swelling has been found since. No animal deserves such barbaric treatment.” Akhilesh Pandey, divisional forest officer, Agra, said, “Snake charming is an illegal and punishable offence that has been going on for years. To combat this, the forest department teams up with Wildlife SOS to rescue snakes from snake charmers every year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/wlsos-foresters-rescue-24-reptiles-from-agra-snake-charmers-101628611521912.html

The couple has spent over two years in jail for entering the country illegally, and the court has ordered the police to make necessary arrangements to send them back home, an official said on Tuesday. Speaking to PTI, the couple said an agent had brought them to Pune from Bangladesh in February 2019, with the promise of getting them jobs with a company. However, they got a rude shock, when the woman was asked to work in the red-light area in Budhwar Peth. "When I resisted and refused to work in the area, the agent got my husband arrested, as neither of us had a valid passport or visa. After I somehow managed to flee the place and reached the police station, I was also arrested for entering the country without valid documents," the woman recounted. A court later convicted the couple and sentenced them to two years and three months in jail. "The agent brought us here promising a job in a company. If we had known that we would get in trouble here, we would not have crossed the border without passports and visa. The agent, who had brought us here, got us arrested. But after spending over two years in jail, we now want to go back to our country and be with our children," the woman said. Inspector Rajendra Landage of Faraskhana police station said the couple, hailing from Satkhira district of Bangladesh, had been arrested and charged under relevant sections of The Foreigners Act and The Passport Act. "Following their release, the court ordered the police to make necessary arrangements to send the couple back to their country. While we are trying to get in touch with the Bangladesh embassy through the Pune police’s special branch, it has been two months since the couple was given an accommodation inside the police station," the official said. The police personnel have been taking care of the couple's needs by providing them food and other daily essentials. "On the occasion of Bakri Eid, we even gave them a set of new clothes and they celebrated the festival with our staff," Landage said, adding that the Bangladesh embassy has been apprised of the couple, but the police are yet to hear from them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/police-station-in-pune-offers-refuge-to-bangladeshi-couple-awaiting-passage-home-101628608266125.html

The over two-month-long Moharram is likely to begin from August 11. This year too, the district administration has denied permission for the processions in wake of the ongoing pandemic and the possible third wave of Covid, which has added to the woes of tazia makers. Those engaged in making tazia said the situation has further pushed this fading trade towards oblivion and left artisans hand to mouth.“We were ready with the tazias thinking that the situation will be normal by Moharram. But, following the confusion over tazia processions, people seem to be avoiding keeping tazia at home, which used to be the tradition during Moharram,” said Sarfaraz Mirza, a tazia maker at Rauza-e-Kazmain – the structure in Old City said to be a replica of the tomb of Hazrat Musa Al-Kazim and his grandson, the ninth Imam Hazrat Taqi al-Jawwad in Iraq. The compound of Rauza-e-Kazmain houses more than 90 families engaged in tazia making and also serves as a biggest ‘mandi’ of tazias of all shapes and sizes. “We generally start making tazias much before Moharram. This is team work in which the entire family gets involved,” said Begum Tahira, a traditional tazia maker.She said each family prepares around 1,500 to 2,000 tazias, depending upon the amount they want to put in. These tazias prepared from bamboo sticks, glossy paper and other decorative items range from ₹10 to ₹40,000. Faiyaz Haider, another tazia maker, said the pandemic situation has made things worse for those engaged in this trade.. Mohd Shahenshah, one of the oldest tazia makers, said Kazmain is a hub of the finest tazia makers. In Lucknow, the tazias are buried in Tal Katora Karbala, in Purana Najaf and Kala Imambada while people of Sunni faith bury it at Phool Katora in Mahanagar area of Lucknow. BOX IMPORTANCE OF TAZIA Nawab Jafar Mir Abdullah, a member of the Royal family of Awadh, said during Moharram, those of Shia sect house tazias at their respective imambaras in their houses. “Those who do not have enough space often convert a small portion of their house to keep tazia, commemorating the martyrdom of Imam Hussain in battle of Karbala,” he said. “Tazias are mostly buried on the 10th Moharram while some of the families bury it on Chehellum – the 40th day of the martyrdom of Imam Hussain while some bury it on the last day of Moharram,” added Abdullah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-continues-to-cast-a-cloud-on-tazia-makers-101628606486351.html
10-08-2021||Bhopal||MP Assembly clears bill on death penalty, life term in spurious liquor cases||The Madhya Pradesh Assembly on Tuesday passed a bill prescribing the capital punishment and life imprisonment in cases related to deaths caused by consumption of spurious liquor. The bill amending the state Excise Act to enhance punishment in spurious liquor cases was presented by state finance and excise minister Jagdish Devda, and the legislation comes in the wake of death of a dozen people recently. Assembly speaker Girish Gautam declared the bill passed without any discussion amid sloganeering by Congress legislators, who were demanding the implementation of the 27 per cent quota for OBCs in jobs and education announced by the erstwhile Kamal Nath government. The Madhya Pradesh Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2021, was proposed by the state government in the backdrop of death of at least seven people after drinking spurious liquor in Mandsaur last month. Later, five persons died following liquor consumption in Indore. Under the bill, provisions of life imprisonment and the death penalty have been made in cases related to deaths due to spurious liquor besides imposing a fine of ₹20 lakh on culprits, a Public Relations Department official said. Before, there was a provision of imprisonment up to 10 years in such cases. Earlier this month, state home minister Narottam Mishra had said that punishment has been increased, ranging from 10 years to a maximum of 14 years from the present one year to six years, in addition to fine of up to ₹10 lakh, in cases of "physical damage" caused to victims after drinking poisonous alcohol. He had said in case of seizure of spurious liquor, the jail term for culprits has also been increased between six and ten years from the present six months to a maximum of four years. The amendment in the bill also proposed that people who attack police and excise department teams while they are seizing illicit liquor will be arrested without a warrant. The scope of punishment has been increased in several other provisions as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-assembly-clears-bill-on-death-penalty-life-term-in-spurious-liquor-cases-101628605138319.html

10-08-2021||Lucknow||Sweetshops flooded with monsoon delights||The sweet shops in the state capital are full of sawan delights these days. Seasons’ special and the most sought-after sweets are varieties of ghewar, pheni and andarsey ki goli. Sweet shops are innovating with ghewar toppings, its portion size and packaging to catch people’s attention. Ram Asrey Sweets, a 206-year-old sweet shop, has introduced blueberry, orange, coconut, mango, rose toppings to their existing flavours of chocolate, pista, paneer, badam, saffron, malai and regular. Its owner Pankaj Gupta is candid in saying that 90% of the business is of plain and malai-kesar ghewar. “We can easily use top-end dry fruits and real-gold foil and make it worth multi-thousand but all that is gimmick. I tell my customers to buy plain one, which has more shelf-life, and then add any home-made malai or rabri and garnish with dry fruit as per taste,” Gupta says. He recalls that as a kid he used to savour it with milk. Chhappan Bhog, another sweet shop in city, has come up with is innovative packaging and sizes. “Mini ghewars, due to its single-use portion size, is in huge demand. Gift hampers comprising of all three sawan special items are selling like hot cakes,” says Ravindra Gupta. Telling us about the sweets connection with tradition he adds, “The most auspicious day is Teej, when family members take the sweet to their daughter’s home. The maximum sale of these delicacies is seen on Teej and then on Raksha Bandhan,” he says. The tradition of ghewar comes from Rajasthan and Braj region as sawan or rainy season is celebrated in these otherwise dry areas, he adds. Not just sweetshops but small eateries in lanes and bylanes prepare andarsey ki goli all day long in small portion. Deepak Sahu who runs a makeshift roadside stall in Chowk exclusively during this season admits that he is doing good business. “Only from July to October, I do these sawan special delicacies and remaining months take up catering assignments or set-up chaat stall. Despite have all top sweet shops in this hub, we have customers coming in big cars. We have customers coming from Agra, Varanasi and Delhi also. Our sweets are also in big demand just like big shops, the only difference is we prepare them in refined oil where as they make in ghee,” he says. He serves two types of pheni, jaggery and sugar andarsa (big ones), andarsa goli, khoya andarsa goli, milk cake, khoya barfi and pedey while ghewar is made on orders. “Main reason for this delicacy to sell in this season is its connection with rains. The more it rains and better these delicacies taste. Pheni and ghewar is made from refined flour while andarsa is made from rice. But the natural blend of sponginess and crispness comes from the moisture,” says Utkarsh Gupta of Classic Radhey Lal Sweets. Advocate Prateek Saxena says ghewar and andarsa is his weakness. “I have controlled diabetes but when I see ghewar, I put all dieting plans aside and always take a big portion. Akhirkaar saal main sirf kuch hi dino main khane ko milti hai!” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sweetshops-flooded-with-monsoon-delights-101628603122364.html

State government is misleading us and is not serious about concerns of the priest community..,” said Krishan Kant Kothiyal, president of the Char Dham Teerth Purohit Hak-Hakookdhari Mahapanchayat, the flag-bearing organisation against the constitution of the board.Krishan Kant Kothiyal suggested that the constitution of the board was tantamount to unfair interference.“Only priests, teerth purohits, pandas and stakeholders of Char Dham shrines and forty- seven other temples are being targeted and brought under this Char Dham Devasthanam Act. Why are we being targeted when the tradition of managing the Char Dhams by local priests and stakeholders has been going on for decades,” said Kothiyal.The Mahapanchayat office-bearers also claimed they had support from Jyotish-Dwarka-Sharda Peeth Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati, who currently holds religious seat of Shankaracharya of Shri Badrinath Dham as well as Dwarka Dham.Meanwhile, at the Kedarnath shrine, agitation of teerth purohits against Devasthanam Board continued on the 58th consecutive day with over twenty local priests associated with the BJP giving up their membership of the party.Kedar Sabha president Vinod Shukla said all teerth purohits will give up anything to ensure the board gets abolished.“We were not also consulted by the government and party office bearers which shows the side-lining of the teerth purohits by the BJP, so we don’t feel right to be associated with such a party,” said Mukesh Shukla, a Teerth purohit.In April, the then chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat had announced that the state government will review the formation of the board following protests by several Hindu akhadas, seers, priests of Char Dham and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leaders looking to safeguard the interest of local priests, who have been traditionally managing these shrines.The Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Bill was passed by Uttarakhand government in December 2019 to create a governing body for the famous holy Hindu shrines of Badrinath, Kedarnath, Yamunotri and Gangotri, known as Char Dham, and nearly 50 other temples in the state. The priests associated with these temples have protested against the board alleging it was a ploy to take over control of the shrines.A SC ruling in response to a 2020 public interest litigation challenging the constitutional validity of the Uttarakhand Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act, 2019 had clarified that the ownership of the temple properties would vest in Char Dham shrines and power of the board will be confined only to the administration and management of the properties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-char-dham-priests-to-launch-state-wide-protest-against-shrine-board-101628602521802.html

The department has directed the individuals to stop further construction and asked them to explain, by August 13, why no action should be taken and the plot restored to its original condition.RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement), said that they had received a complaint about illegal construction of flats in the revenue estate of Gurugram village, for which requisite permissions were not taken from DTCP or other agencies. “No permission has been taken concerning the change of land use and these flats have been constructed in violation of rules. We have issued a show-cause notice to 22 persons and asked them to explain the violations,” he said, adding that vacant flats will be sealed and no further construction is being allowed.Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner (enforcement), said that the project comprises 19 buildings, with 135 flats already constructed. People have already started living here and the department will seek directions from its headquarters in Chandigarh for action concerning occupied flats, he said.According to DTCP officials, the Sai Lane Colony on Old Railway Road has been constructed on around 5,000 square yards. Till 2014, this plot was owned by a trust and it was sold to a private company, following which construction of flats started after 2015.Bhath said that if a satisfactory reply is not received, a final notice will be given to the violators and action will be taken as per rules. “After this matter came to notice of director, DTCP, he issued strict instructions to the enforcement department that no such constructions will be allowed in controlled areas.

10-08-2021||Bangalore||Lighthouse: RSS and its ways to influence Tamil Nadu||Tamil Nadu has been on the radar of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for a while, more intensely since the passing away of influential leaders like Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi. The National Council meeting of the RSS was held in Coimbatore for the first time in the state in the organisation’s 92-year-old history in March 2017. This meeting of Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha (ABPS), the highest decision-making and policy formulation body of the RSS, was inaugurated by Mohan Bhagwat himself. Tamil Nadu and Punjab are two states which have been resisting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) strongly due to their insistence on preservation of their distinct identity. The RSS, which found it difficult to organise rallies or demonstrations in Tamil Nadu under the late chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s regime, conducted its route march in Chennai after a gap of 16 years in January, 2017. Today, there are nearly 2,200 shakas operating currently in Tamil Nadu and 600 shakas have been established in the last few years alone. There are 100,000 shakas operating today throughout the country. This figure indicates an increase of nearly 100 % during the period between 2010 and 2020.Also Read | In pics: TN fishermen protest against Indian Marine Fisheries BillThere are also front organisations like Hindu Munnani (Hindu Front) and associate political parties like Hindu Mahasabha which are also quite active at the grassroots. Shakas are a regular feature in rural areas of Tamil Nadu, especially in the Coimbatore-Nilgiris zone. The RSS leadership in Tamil Nadu believes that the growth of organisation would automatically impact on the voters’ mobilisation in favour of the BJP. The RSS is responsible for coordinating sympathetic private school & college managements and select private universities with strong affiliations to the organisation in Tamil Nadu under common socio-cultural and religious grouping with a long-term strategy of political functions for the BJP. These institutions are part of the ideological and political lobbying network with the presence of powerful RSS members on board who hold high positions in the Union government and other critical national institutions, including the Reserve Bank of India.There are increasing numbers of students’ scholarships available for the organisation and party members studying in the colleges and universities. The RSS is also active at the grassroots with the networking of influential north Indian traders and business community along with the facilitation of ration cards & voter identity for the vast number of migrant labour from North in metropolis and big cities in Tamil Nadu. All these networking happen in the name of hosting nationalist and religious events in the semi-urban and urban areas as well as by organising weekend get-togethers of influential business persons/groups.The donations for temples and financing of rural religious festivals are increasingly becoming common. The RSS local units are advised to identify temples longing for financial support and organise activities to engage the local community, especially the women.One of the foremost strategies of the RSS is to take over temples and its management through penetration into the temple committees. There is a concerted campaign by the RSS and its affiliate organisations in the state against the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) of the government of Tamil Nadu.This is a twin headed policy drive for RSS and BJP in the state with mutual benefits of organisational growth and political outreach for the party. The strategy includes the politics of provocation like saffronisation of poet-philosopher Thiruvalluvar and adoption of celebrated deity Murugan as part of its propaganda machinery which are desperate acts to absorb the popular attention of the masses. Religious chants were liberally mixed with the election campaign during the Assembly Elections 2021 by the BJP, including the Prime Minister himself during his election campaigns in Tamil Nadu.There is a special focus to draw more women’s support and the RSS is directly involved in organising Lakshmi Pooja on full moon days and on special occasions through its local units in different parts of the state. Vinayaka Chathurthi and Krishna Jayanthi festivals are slowly being surrendered to the initiatives of RSS in Tamil Nadu like elsewhere in the country. Mohan Bhagwat, the RSS chief did find a cause to join the Pongal festival in Tamil Nadu in January 2021 with state assembly elections only a few months away. RSS is also trying to absorb local deities and cults as part of its new drive to thrust a dominant Hindu paradigm as well as distort the local beliefs and indigenous practices as though they have no roots. There are also reverse attempts by generating Tamil identity such as Tamil Divine Society (Tamil Deivega Sangam) initiatives as a mask to cover the saffronisation of Tamil Hindu society as well as to defy its image as a north-centric politico-religious outfit.BJP’s attempts to gain greater influence in Tamil Nadu politics through caste and communal politics will continue as core strategies in the near future. Despite the presence of a strong Dravidian movement and social bases, RSS and its affiliates will continue to engage and conduct politics in Tamil Nadu with an assurance of power at the Union remains unchallenged.

In 2019, the state hosted FIH Men’s Series Finals and Olympic Hockey Qualifiers. Despite the pandemic last year, Odisha hosted FIH Pro League in 2020. To further strengthen the hockey ecosystem in Sundargarh, the government is planning to lay synthetic hockey turf in each of the 17 blocks of the district.In July 2017, Odisha became the talking point of international sports bodies, when the state government organised the 22nd Asian Athletics Championship hosting over 560 athletes from 41 countries which earned it praise from world athletics federation president Sebastian Coe. In 2019, it hosted the 21st Commonwealth Table Tennis Championship at the Jawaharlal Indoor Stadium in Cuttack. In 2020, it announced the sponsorship the Indian men’s and women’s national rugby team for the next three years and its facilitation of high performance training and conditioning of the players. The state is a strategic partner of the AIFF and has been shortlisted as venue for FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup and AFC Asian Women’s Cup in 2022.Just before the pandemic hit India last year, the first-ever Khelo India University Games was held in Odisha, in which 4,000 athletes from 176 universities participated in 211 events in 17 sports over a period of 10 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-announces-sports-infra-project-worth-rs-693-35-crore-101628599882072.html

10-08-2021||Chandigarh||Black and white memories from good old school days||The moment we stepped into our classroom in school, our vibrant rainbow-like life would fuse into two fundamental colours, black and white. My little daughter was bemused to learn that in our school days, a large blackboard attached to the wall was used by teachers for writing on with a white chalk. Her jaw-dropping expression was justified for Covid has confined her initial phase of learning to an internet-enabled tablet. She is accustomed to studying from tech-savvy teachers, scribbling words on a smart board with multicoloured markers and rubbing them off with gentle swipes of their hands. My daughter’s imploring entreaty, soaked in inquisitiveness to get a deeper insight into traditional teaching modules, consumed me with nostalgia. Also read: Why Canada again extended ban on direct flights from India | ExplainedBack in our school days, fetching a chalk box from the staffroom was deemed a privileged obligation and whoever was entrusted with the task, would perform it with utmost devotion, solemnity, and sincerity. Flaunting the prized possession in hand, the student would strut back into the classroom with squared shoulders and keep it safe on the ledge of the blackboard beside a duster. That small piece of chalk was our teachers’ chief weapon, using which they would stroke their knowledge all over that big black canvas, whitening it up radiantly with their priceless lessons, life-changing thoughts, and righteous morals. Their prudently frugal approach in consuming resources at hand with minimum wastage often came to the fore. The rising cadence of the squeak of the tapering chalk, grating heavily on our auditory nerves, would fail to persuade them into replacing that minuscule old and worn-out piece with a new one until the very last vestige of it was put to use. Rubbing off the blackboard clean with a duster was another task every student yearned wistfully to undertake with the covert aim to earn brownie points from their teachers. One heart-warming memory that exercised a coveted edge over many was our queer manner of wishing our mathematics teacher on her birthday. Once when she entered the classroom, she was shocked to note that no one stood up to greet her. Hardly did she spell out her annoyance to our impudence than the whole classroom shouted in a chorus to look back and sprung a pleasant surprise on her. Spinning around, she felt overwhelmed at the scintillating sight of the blackboard chalked all over with birthday wishes and testimonies beautified with drawings of balloons, buntings, fairy lights, tinsels, and streamers. Reading out each message under her breath with a smile on her lips, and to acknowledge our pure gesture, she decided not to rub the blackboard off and oddly went for oral revision through her period. Having struggled to sustain the sweeping change, that complementary pair of hard black board and soft white chalk swapped colours by turning, as if by magic, into a white board and a black marker, while their third buddy, the duster, bravely survived the test of time. The smooth flow of the soft tip of that new marker on a finely polished whiteboard permanently silenced the crude rasping scrape of the chalk but contrastingly our peer group, driven by emotional adherence, often silently wished within to have continued with the old school of thought. The inseparable duo has merrily slipped into the folklore of yore, however even years later my heart palpably feels a sense of close even-handed attachment with both as their mere mention rekindles a host of beautiful memories and priceless pleasures of our unforgettable school days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/black-and-white-memories-from-good-old-school-days-101628597001438.html

10-08-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: Parking the problem in a no-parking zone in Pune is not the answer||We don’t have to be nostalgic for the good ol’ times before Covid. They are back again, with a vengeance. Our streets are again full of parked vehicles leaving little space to walk, cycle or even drive. Parking is a problem in Pune – too many parked vehicles spilling onto footpaths and carriageways, and no prioritisation of spaces for people with disabilities, emergency needs and public transport. Instead of clamouring for more parking, we need to stop and ask for managing existing parking spaces well. The issue A vehicle typically needs three different parking spaces – at the owner’s place, at the workplace, and other places a person might drive to. The increase in private vehicles implies that parking-space demand also increases. However, city- and street-space is precious and limited. It meets many other needs – mobility of people using environment-friendly travel modes, street vendors’ livelihoods, vegetation, and civic services like waste management. PMC is implementing excellent street designs, such as in Aundh and on JM road. But, the beautiful public space created for walking and cycling is quickly taken over by parked vehicles. We cannot first build huge parking lots and then try to manage parking space. There will never be enough space and money to build parking lots. Parking lots occupy land that could have been playgrounds and gardens, woefully in short supply. Pune’s progressive parking policy A progressive approach is already detailed out in Pune’s Parking Policy, approved by the PMC General Body in 2016, but not yet implemented. It recognises parking as an essential component of the transportation system that if not managed properly, can create a public nuisance. The policy has three crucial components. The first is designation of three parking zones based on the current demand for parking: A – high parking demand; B - medium parking demand; and C - low parking demand. The second component is fixing parking charges in these zones, and the third is creation and management of parking facilities with a view to reducing parking demand and dependence on personal motor vehicles.A basic fee for different vehicle types and parking duration is recommended. Over and above the base rate, dynamic pricing is suggested. Short-duration parking is to be cheaper. Commodities are cheaper if you buy in bulk, but good parking management works the other way. You should pay at a higher rate if you are parking longer – this encourages you to vacate your slot quickly. People who need to park their vehicle for the whole day, say when they drive to work, could use cheaper parking which may be a short walk from their offices. Where off-street parking is available, on-street parking should be significantly more expensive, to encourage people to use parking structures. The idea is that folks who want to use personal motor vehicles must pay the full value of the parking space they occupy. In turn, revenue from parking fees, expected to be several crores of rupees a year, must be used to improve public transport facilities. Special parking plans are supposed to be created for hospitals, railway stations, bus stations and tourism sites. Areas with extensive freight movement may also need special plans. PMPML buses, ambulances, school buses are exempt from parking charges. Autorickshaw stands are already designated in some areas, and the Parking Policy supports the demarcation of such stands where needed. And yes, since Pune was and aims to be a city of cycles, if you pedal, you may park for free! A Pune parking app is expected to be developed to let drivers know about parking availability and charges. Apart from these provisions, attention is needed for managing parking needs of residents in localities with older houses, apartments, and informal settlements without their own parking spaces. In addition, delivery vans, autos, and cabs may also need special space allocation. Further, in the Development Control Rules, presently, residential and commercial buildings are required to provide a certain minimum amount of parking – as if the city confesses that it cannot provide good public transport, so people should fend for themselves and hence, will need ample parking. Progressive cities around the world put an upper limit on parking space and use precious urban space for better facilities for walking, cycling and public transport. Urgent, systematic implementation needed With rising congestion, poor air quality, concerns about road safety and difficulty of parking when really needed in an emergency, the public is facing the consequence of non-implementation of the parking policy. In the core city and many segments of the arterial roads, there is a crying need to prioritise de-congestion, mobility, and efficient use of road space. However, if a limited stretch of road is designated as a no-parking zone, the adjoining areas become clogged with parking. Instead of a piecemeal approach, the city authorities must initiate a structured approach of area-based parking management plans with stakeholders’ participation as recommended in the parking policy. These plans should include user communication mechanisms, strengthening public transport and non-motorised transport facilities as required, clear definition of parking and no-parking spaces, parking charges, and enforcement. What can you do? The first thing is to recognise that “parking is not a right”. Those who drive should try to locate off-street parking and be prepared to pay the fee. As citizens and neighbourhood groups, we need to demand that our elected representatives implement the already-approved, forward-looking Pune Parking Policy. We should participate in processes to organise and regulate parking spaces. Alongside, we should assess public transport and demand for better services, universal accessibility, and last-mile connectivity, where ever needed. The sooner we, individually and as a city, limit the occupation of our streets with parked vehicles and shift to walking, cycling, and public transport, the better it is for our collective good.

10-08-2021||Chandigarh||Beyond Tokyo: Making India the best sporting nation||We must congratulate our national superheroes for winning seven Olympic medals, including a gold, two silver and four bronze, in the Tokyo Olympics. It’s a much to be celebrated achievement because some lost glory has been restored after decades and the first gold medal in track and field events has been won. Also, for the first time our women’s hockey team reached the semi-finals, giving a lot of hope for the future. The euphoria across the nation is as expected and it’s heartening to see governments announcing cash rewards and incentives to the medal winners, sending the right message to budding sportspersons to pursue sports as a career. It’s also time to do some serious thinking and analyse our sports achievements vis-a-vis other countries. Also read: The goal was to inspire women, we created a legacy: Women’s hockey coach MarijneOur overall rank in the Tokyo Olympics medal tally is 48. We are a nation of 139 crore with more than 30 crore youth of Olympic participation age, which is almost equal to the population of the US, which has won the highest number of gold medals (39) and the total number of medals (113) in the Tokyo Olympics. Even smaller countries, a few smaller than some of our states, have performed better by winning more medals. Targets for next three Olympics Before the euphoria dies down and we get back to our routines, there is a need to formulate policies and create structures for ensuring that India emerges as the best sporting nation in the next few Olympics. As an immediate measure, we can fix some targets based on our present performance and capabilities The following, to my mind can be achievable targets for the next three Olympics.1. In the 2024 Olympics at Paris, we may ensure that all those sportspersons who had qualified this time should win medals in their respective events, especially those who had reached the last 16 of their competitions, as they are well exposed to the requirement of winning. We may add as many more sports to qualify for the next games so that our participation increases. 2. For the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, our target should be to ensure participation in almost all events that are organised in the Olympics along with ensuring the continuity of the principle of winning medals for all previously participated events.3.In the 2032 Olympics in Brisbane, we should target top positions as the highest gold medals and total medals winning nation.Systems and structuresThe next important question is how these targets can be achieved and what kind of systems and structures should be created. My suggestions are the following: 1.There should be centres of excellence for each major sport or a group of similar games. For example, A centre of excellence each for hockey, football, volleyball and handball, for athletics (running events), throws (javelin, hammer, shotput), wrestling and boxing besides water sports. These can be 15 to 20 and each major Indian state should have one such centre. 2. These centres of excellence should have players at three age levels, namely below 15 years, below 19 years and seniors. Each age group should have 10 times the number of players in a playing team with a minimum of 100 players in each age group to begin with. This number can subsequently be increased according to available talent for that sport. 3.These centres should be residential for full-time training and must provide all facilities to the selected players such as quality board and lodging, diet, even pocket money, so that the players are devoted to their game.4.These centres should provide facilities for study according to the aspiration and eligibility of the players so that they are not deprived of basic educational qualifications. The teaching hours must be flexible to accommodate the sports timings of the players.5.The selection of the players should be done by giving sufficient notice for trials to be held at each district headquarters by the teams of highly qualified achievers of the game and coaches in a transparent and objective manner.6.The centres should have state-of-the-art infrastructure that can be created jointly by the central and state governments. One option can be that the infrastructure is created by the central government and its maintenance and running cost can be met by the state governments or vice-versa. Corporates may also be roped in to sponsor some of these centres.7.The centres should be managed by top sportspersons and coaches supported by competent professional management experts along with nutrition experts, physiology experts and sports medicine and fitness professionals.Like Odisha’s initiative for hockey, Punjab can establish a centre for shooting and archery, Haryana for wrestling, Kerala for water sports and Rajasthan for equestrian events. Let the achievements of our sports heroes in the Olympics become a launching pad for our country to become the number one sporting nation of the world. rs_bawa1@rediffmail.com The writer is pro vice-chancellor of Chandigarh University, Gharuan.

These stations come under the ambit of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation's (BMC) jurisdiction.Speaking to reporters, Pednekar said, “Citizens should not indulge in altercations as long queues are likely at ticket counters. People should cooperate and follow the Covid-19 norms.”Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday announced that the Mumbai suburban train services will resume for passengers, who are fully vaccinated with both doses of Covid-19 vaccines. However, there needs to be a gap of 14 days after taking the second dose before a person can avail of the service.Thackeray, however, cautioned people against lowering their guard as the coronavirus crisis is “yet not over.” Taking to Twitter, he said, “I know that people are running out of patience due to the lockdown curbs…We are trying to strike a balance between keeping the virus in check and opening up financial activities.”Also Read | Maharashtra allows fully vaccinated to use Mumbai locals from August 15Mumbai local train services were until now only open to government employees and essential service staffers. It has been closed to the general public since April this year owing to the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, only after resuming services on February 1 after almost a year of remaining off the tracks.The new arrangement for fully vaccinated people requires them to first register themselves on a mobile application currently being developed by the state government for them to travel on the Mumbai suburban train network. This registration facility will be available offline at the offices of civic bodies and railways.The QR code-based passes will be issued on the application after passengers register and submit their vaccination certificates.When asked about Ganeshotsav Kruti Samiti’s demand of allowing fully vaccinated citizens to participate in Ganpati immersion processions, Pednekar told media persons that Thackeray will take a decision on the matter after a discussion with the state Covid-19 task force.A senior member of the task force, Dr Shashank Joshi on Monday said that if the daily coronavirus caseload of Maharashtra continues to witness a downward trend, the state government may consider easing more restrictions starting September 1.Also Read | May ease more curbs from Sept 1 if Covid cases fall: Maha task force memberMaharashtra on Tuesday recorded 4,505 fresh cases as against Monday’s 5,508.

Raje said PM Narendra Modi visited at the time of Cyclone Taukte; Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also visited the flood affected area and brought relief to the people. The CM should also come out and take care of the people. Expressing her concern, she demanded that the chief minister visited flood-hit Jhalawar, Baran and other districts in Kota division. She said 100% of crops in the Hadauti region were damaged but the divisional commission gave a report of 30% damage. “Dozens of people died, hundreds of houses collapsed, thousands of animals died and went missing but the state government and administration remained ineffective,” she said. Reacting to Raje’s allegations, Congress spokesperson RC Choudhary said the chief minister is closely monitoring the flood situation, and ensuring that timely relief reaches people. Such allegations by the Opposition during a disaster are unfortunate. “This is a natural calamity and everyone should stand and work together to bring relief to people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/cm-gehlot-should-step-out-to-help-the-flood-hit-in-rajasthan-raje-101628589440707.html
10-08-2021||Delhi||Thorough probe needed in oxygen related deaths in 2nd wave: Sisodia||Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday said a thorough probe was needed into deaths related to oxygen shortage during the last Covid-19 wave in the Capital, and asserted that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government shall soon share details in this regard with the Centre.“We faced a major oxygen crisis during the last wave of Covid-19. As a government, we are taking all steps to ensure that it doesn’t happen again in case of potential future waves. But we appeal to the Central government to take the issue seriously too. I have come across news reports today that said that the Central government has claimed to have sought response on oxygen deaths from 13 states so far of which only one has accepted deaths caused by oxygen shortage. We have also learnt that states were given time till August 13 to respond to the Centre’s queries on the issue. However, we (Delhi government) have received no letter from the Central government with any query on oxygen deaths,” said Sisodia in a video press briefing that was live streamed.At its peak, Delhi recorded around 28,300 cases in a day and a positivity rate exceeding 36% on April 20 and 22 respectively. Around that time, at least 31 Covid patients are believed to have died due to oxygen shortage in two hospitals. Several deaths linked to oxygen shortage were reported from other states too around this time. However, a political blame game ensued between the Centre and the Opposition when the Union government told Parliament that no state had identified oxygen shortage as the cause of deaths caused by the second wave of the pandemic.“We accept that the oxygen crisis happened during the last wave of the pandemic. And without any probe it is difficult to say if that has caused deaths. I am going deeper into whether it has or has not. I am stressing on the importance of thorough investigation into cases of deaths that can be related to oxygen shortage,” Sisodia said.On May 4, the Delhi government told Delhi high court that an expert committee could not ascertain whether 21 deaths at the capital’s Jaipur Golden Hospital had happened because of oxygen shortage. The leaders of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that runs the Central government later cited this submission to accuse the Opposition of hypocrisy on the matter of oxygen-related deaths.The AAP government in Delhi criticised the Central government saying it did not let the city government probe such matters by setting up a larger expert committee. Health minister Satyandar Jain had pointed out that the submission in court on deaths in Jaipur Golden hospital was based on “preliminary” findings and the matter needed more investigation.Sisodia on Tuesday added that all states should be given enough time to “investigate” such matters. “Without that, how can they draw conclusions. Though we have not been asked yet, we have decided to share such details with the central government very soon. And I appeal that it should be made public along with details of other states,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/manish-sisodia-says-thorough-probe-needed-in-oxygen-related-deaths-in-2nd-wave-101628589380751.html

Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav said those arrested, apart from Upadhyay, are Preet Singh, Deepak Singh, Deepak Kumar, Vinod Sharma, and Vinit Bajpai.The slogans were raised purportedly at an event organised on Sunday to demand the abolition of colonial-era laws. The video was circulated after the event organised by Upadhyay under the banner of Bharat Jodo Andolan (unite India movement) at Jantar Mantar. Police said permission was not granted for the event.Upadhyay on Monday claimed no inflammatory slogans were raised at the event.Also Read | Covid-19: Delhi govt issues SOPs for partial re-opening of schoolsHT tried to contact Upadhyay on Tuesday for his comments, but his mobile phone was switched off.Early on Tuesday, Hindu Sena chief Vishnu Gupta issued a statement saying police raided his residence around 1.30am and he was “illegally arrested on false charges for Jantar Mantar controversial remarks by some unknown activists”. Police denied Gupta was arrested in the case.On Monday, the police said they registered a case against unknown persons under Indian Penal Code’s (IPC) Sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc, and acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant).

10-08-2021||Other||Kerala: Catholic church observes anniversary of MTP Act as black day||The Catholic church is observing Tuesday, the 50th anniversary of the implementation of Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act in India, as a black day. The family commission of the Kerala Catholic Bishops Conference (KCBC), an apex body of Christians, asked believers to observe the day as “Day of Protection of Life”, ring bells in churches and conduct special prayers for terminated foetuses. The KCBC has asked all 32 dioceses in the state to protest against the MTP Act and uphold pro-life activities. The MTP Act was introduced in the country in 1971, allowing termination of certain pregnancies by registered medical practitioners--as long as the length of pregnancy did not exceed 20 weeks. If so, special permission is required from a competent court. The church has been opposing all types of abortions saying human life must be respected and protected from the moment of conception. In 2020, Pope Francis had exhorted believers to observe 2020-21 as the Year of Family. Also Read | ‘Procreate more, win big rewards’: Kerala Catholic commission sends out message to believersThe church was in the news two weeks ago after it announced a series of incentives for followers to have more children as part of the Year of the Family celebrations. It said the move was also aimed to check a fall in the Catholic population in the state, but it comes at a time when the country is debating whether population needs to be controlled by dis-incentivising couples with more than two children. Many states have introduced special laws to curb population explosion. But the KCBC justified its decision and expressed grave concern over the low birth rate among believers. It said in 1950, Christians formed 24.6% of Kerala’s population and in 2011, the number fell to 17.2%. It fears that in the next census there will be a dip of 2 to 4%. It said the community has the lowest birth rate (among communities in the country) of 1.8% and if the situation continued like this, the very existence of the community will be in danger. Kerala is the largest Christian-populated state in the country, followed by Nagaland. “It is not logical to consider population reduction as the only solution for social crises arising out of improper developmental policies,” said the KCBC in a statement, citing China’s recent stance. It said countries such as China are forced to rethink its policies due to ill-effects of rampant population control. It also justified the decision announced by many dioceses like Pala, Idukki and Thamarasserry to reward families who have four or more children. Pastoral letters were read in many churches in the state two weeks ago reminding believers about their “family duty and obligation”. “Drastic fall in birth is a serious concern. There are many policies to support families that receive more children. We have to formulate more such plans to encourage family life,” said Father Paul Simenthy, secretary of the KCBC family commission. Pala diocese in Kottayam was the first, last week, to announce ₹1500 monthly assistance for couples married after the year 2000, who have four or more children. The church also offered free education and medical care for siblings and parents, relying on its control of several educational institutions and hospitals in the state. Later many dioceses followed suit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kerala-catholic-church-observes-anniversary-of-mtp-act-as-black-day-101628572699589.html

Inaugurating the ATM, Ramesh RS, the Chief General Manager (Northeast Circle) of SBI told the small gathering, “On behalf of SBI, we are really delighted to have this opportunity to have an ATM in this iconic hospital, which has completed almost 100 by its hospital for the yeomen service to the people of Meghalaya and neighbouring states since time immemorial and now, especially amidst the greatest health challenge mankind has ever had to face; the life consuming Covid-19 pandemic.The small but meaningful gathering was attended by the bank’s Deputy General Manager Amit Kumar and other officers while the hospital was represented by its Medical Superintendent, Dr Roken Nongrum.John Adrian Shepherd Barron was born at the Gordon Robert Hospital in Shillong on June 23, 1925; about three years after the hospital came into existence. His father was Wilfred Shepherd Barron, the Chief Engineer of the Chittagong Port Commissionerate and his mother was Dorothy, an Olympic tennis player and a Wimbledon Women’s Doubles champion.The Shillong-born British innovator had joined De La Rue a British company headquartered in Basingstoke, England that manufactures polymer and security printed products including banknotes and tax stamps in the 1950s as a management trainee and swiftly rose the ranks to become the Managing Director in record time.Galvanised by chocolate vending machines, he conceived what at that point of time surely sounded ridiculous, the idea of cash vending machines as well. Interestingly, the ‘Eureka’ bolt of creating a self-service machine dispensing cash came to him whilst lying in the bath.The first De La Rue Automatic Cash System (DACS) machine, called Barclaycash, was installed outside the Enfield branch of Barclays Bank in north London in June 1967. And, the first person to withdraw cash at the DACS machine was actor Reg Varney, a celebrity resident of Enfield. Now, life without ATMs is almost impossible for all kinds of financial transactions across the globe.Though there is no record of the British innovator leaving Shillong, it is apparent that the family left after his Scottish father took over as the Chief Engineer of the Port of London Authority.John Adrian Shepherd Barron was educated at Stowe School, the University of Edinburgh and Trinity College, Cambridge. During World War II, he was commissioned into the Airborne Forces, serving with the 159th Parachute Light Regiment.The innovator of ATM died on May 15, 2010 after a brief illness at the age of 84 at the Raigmore Hospital at Inverness in Scotland.His son, Nicholas Shepherd-Barron is professor of algebraic geometry at the King’s College London.

His petition added that if the concept was replicated in 720 districts across the country,it can easily triple existing medical seats available nationwide and also reach close to a healthy doctor: patients ratio of 1:1000, as contemplated by the World Health Organixation.The 56-year-old media consultant has claimed that the PG-NEET has not only restricted the number of PG medical seats to 43,000 - half of 86,000 MBBS seats, but the shortage of seats has also given rise to the problem of corruption in the admission process and demand and payment of huge capitation fees.“The petitioner is of the opinion that if all 86,000 students who have completed MBBS, having studied for 5-and-a-half years, to move forward and do post graduation in the discipline of their choice, in the same medical college as in-house students, it would provide a large contingent of medical professionals,” stated the petition.It added that the petitioner has “after a lot of study through discussion with cross sections of persons, private and government, connected to medical education, has come to the conclusion that there is no need for NEET-PG to be conducted for a doctor who had graduated, licensed and registered as a doctor with the Medical Council of India.”“They are declared doctors and have the right to study higher and practice and yet they are forced by the system to go back to the next step of NEET where they began their carriers 5-and-half years ago,” Nair’s petition added.The petition added that under- graduate medical courses are available at 542 medical colleges across the nation, but PG medical courses are available only in 64 colleges.Nair has, therefore, urged the high court to either direct the central government to discontinue PG-NEET or double the intake of PG medical courses.The PIL will be heard by the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pil-urges-bombay-high-court-to-scrap-pgneet-101628568739203.html

10-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi weather: Dry spell likely for next few days, says IMD||From Tuesday, Delhi is likely to witness “break monsoon” conditions for the next seven to ten days, India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said. Met officials said that as the monsoon trough has shifted to the north of Delhi, the Capital along with some other neighbouring states might experience a dry spell for the next few days. “Monsoon entering a break phase means that there is no intense system that can result in rainfall. It happens when the monsoon trough moves to another region. From August 10, the trough is likely to move north to the Himalayan foothills. During this period, parts of northwest and central India will mostly be dry till the trough again starts moving towards the south. Good rainfall spells may occur once the monsoon recedes, covering for the first half,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.Also Read | Widespread rain likely over NE states, Uttarakhand, parts of UP for 5 daysThe break may last till around August 19, said experts. This is a usual phenomenon that is observed almost every other year. “In the absence of rainfall, the temperatures are likely to rise and may be above the season’s normal,” Srivastava added.He added that though Delhi receives most of its monsoon rain in August, showers in the second half may be able to cover for the entire month. The city usually gets 247mm rain in August.Forecasters said that break monsoon conditions are not uncommon in northwest India around August, when the region has already received a round of rain spell, before monsoon showers resume again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-weather-dry-spell-likely-for-next-few-days-says-imd-101628563638985.html

The relaxation has been given till September 30.The Delhi government said that the decision has been taken in view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) situation. "As per an advisory issued by the government of India on June 17, parking/custody charges imposed under Rule 16 of Delhi Maintenance and Management of Parking Rules 2019 are waived off," the order said.According to transport department officials, as quoted by news agency PTI, many vehicle owners could not get their impounded vehicles released due to Covid and lockdown which led to accumulated custody charges. The officials claimed that one vehicle had a custody charge of ₹2 lakh, PTI reported.The Union ministry of road transport and highways, in its June order, suggested extending the validity of various kinds of motor vehicle documents like driving licenses, fitness test and registration certificates, that could not be renewed due to lockdown, up to September 30.Vehicles impounded for any violations of the Motor Vehicles Act by enforcement teams of the Transport Department or the Delhi Traffic Police are slapped with custody charges if their owners do not get them released within 48 hours. Depending upon the type of vehicle, custody charges ranging from ₹200 to ₹1,500 are imposed per day.The transport department keeps hundreds of such vehicles at impounding pits located in Burari, Dwarka and Sarai Kale Khan.The Delhi government had ordered similar relaxation last year too. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said that the relaxation was given due to Covid-19 restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-waives-custody-charges-on-impounded-vehicles-till-september-30-101628561534560.html

The panel has divided the suggestions into 53 categories.The Uttar Pradesh Population (Control, Stabilisation and Welfare) Bill aims to bring down the gross fertility rate in the state by limiting government benefits for couples with more than two children, and offering incentives to those who have a maximum of two children.The bill was uploaded on the law panel’s website on July 9, inviting suggestions from the public till July 19.State Law Commission chairman Justice AN Mittal, a former judge of the Allahabad high court who is preparing the draft for the bill, said: “The State Law Commission has received wide-ranging suggestions. People have suggested permission for a third child to parents who have two daughters.” The draft, he added, has been completed and the panel would soon call on chief minister Yogi Adityanath to hand over the report.Experts criticised the suggestion. “Such suggestions must not be accepted. It promotes a mindset that prefers sons over daughters,” said Madhu Garg, vice president, UP, the All India Democratic Women’s Association.Justice Mittal said other suggestions received by the panel include imposition of a fine on couples who opt for a third child and banning them from contesting parliamentary and assembly elections. “Some have also suggested permission for a third child to couples whose children are physically challenged.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/allowing-3rd-child-after-2-daughters-among-suggestions-for-up-draft-bill-101628553873060.html
10-08-2021||Mumbai||In 2 yrs, Maharashtra farmers ineligible for PM-Kisan aid granted ₹358.99 cr||Nearly 571,745 farmers who were not eligible for aid under the PM-Kisan (Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi ) cash transfer scheme were given ₹358.99 crore over the last two years. The state government has begun the process of recovering the amount paid to them.The scheme involves the transfer of ₹6,000 a year to poor farmers in three instalments. Thus far, eight instalments have been paid and the ninth will be credited on August 9. A scrutiny of the beneficiaries has found a large number of beneficiaries in the state. Of the 571, 745, 262,960 are income tax payees, who were outed after the tax department linked the list of IT payees with the list of beneficiaries. The remaining 308,785 were termed ineligible for other reasons.The information has been obtained under RTI by Hindustan Times from the state agriculture commissionerate.On July 22, HT reported how 4.2 million ineligible farmers have received ₹2,900 crore under the scheme across the country. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar told Parliament that the largest numbers of such ineligible beneficiaries were in Assam, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, Punjab and Bihar.“The Maharashtra government requested the Union government to link IT payees with the list of beneficiaries in this scheme. The Centre informed us about the ineligible beneficiaries after doing this... Only one person from a home of the couple and their minor children can avail the benefit, but in some cases both more than one member of the family applied,” said state agriculture commissioner Dheeraj Kumar. “We have asked district collectors to expedite the recovery of the money wrongly credited to farmers,” he added.There may be some challenges on that front, another official familiar with the matter said.“We recently filed an FIR in Nanded after we found that 30,000 fake accounts of beneficiaries were created by creating fake user IDs...”Vinay Kumar Awate, deputy commissioner, Agriculture, said, “The number of the ineligible beneficiaries may rise as we have also found some beneficiaries from other states too...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/in-2-yrs-maharashtra-farmers-ineligible-for-pm-kisan-aid-granted-358-99-cr-101628553519360.html
10-08-2021||Delhi||Active Covid cases in Delhi below 500||The number of active cases in the national capital fell below 500 on Monday, for the first time since the early days of the pandemic in March and April last year, as the city continued its progress in a remarkable turnaround after the punishing fourth wave of infections between April and May this year.Delhi added 39 new cases of Covid-19 on Monday, even as 76 more people recovered from the infection, showed data from the state’s daily health bulletin. As a result, the city’s active case count fell from 536 on Sunday to 498.The city added one more death of the infection.The test positivity rate also fell below 0.10% once again, after two days, to 0.08%, showed data from the state government bulletin.Positivity rate is a crucial metric as experts say it shows how widespread the virus is in the community, and when a dropping positivity rate is coupled with decreasing new cases, it indicates that the spread of the virus is reducing within the community.As a rule of thumb, tracking a region’s positivity rate serves as a good barometer for whether cases are going to increase or decrease in the coming days: a rising positivity rate generally means cases will rise in the immediate future, while a dropping positivity rate tends to precede a drop in new infections.In Delhi, this number has been below 5% for 81 days, and below 1% for 71 days, according to the state government’s health bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/active-covid-cases-in-delhi-below-500-101628549954234.html
10-08-2021||Delhi||Foot soldiers in rain: Going beyond the call of duty||Standing neck deep in water, wearing rain boots and helping to not just clear the traffic but also to go beyond their call of duty to help citizens sail through the water, quite literally, are the cops in Delhi-NCR. The past few weeks have seen the Capital getting lashed by the rain, followed by waterlogging reported at several key junctions. And images of police personnel, stepping up to aid those stuck, have surfaced online. From facilitating the traffic flow to lifting trees that fell due to strong wind and rain and even filing potholes, the men in khaki are doing it all. Filling potholes in Gurugram, which were created due to heavy rain, Shahid Ahmed, in charge of traffic control in Gurugram Police, says, “It rained heavily the second time here, and there was a lot of water around. There have been many instances when my colleagues and me filled up the potholes that are dangerous in this weather and can cause serious accidents. There was this one instance when a manhole got jammed, and we tried to take out the mud or garbage so that water could drain out. All inspectors and constables, deputed at different points, are our foot soldiers in this time of rains, as saving people’s lives is of prime importance to us. And we ensure that our officials are well equipped with raincoats and umbrellas.”Ritesh Kumar, SHO, Greater Kailash, who recently pitched in to lift a fallen tree on a day when it rained excessively in the city, says, “There are no limitations when it comes to duty. Saamne koi situation ho, toh usko solve karna humara maksad rehta hai. Kaise kisi ko problem se bahar nikalna hain, yehi koshish hoti hai. Pehle human life save karna sabse zaroori hai. When I was lifting the tree, some people saw me and came forward to help. They, too did their service to humanity by helping us. Yehi sabse badi duty hai!”And then there’s sub inspector Joginder Singh, from Gurugram Police, who helped dug out water stuck at a man hole. He says, “Mana yeh duty se hatke hai, par zaruri tha kyunki pani nikal hi nahin raha tha IFFCO Chowk pe. Pura din pareshan rahenge sab yeh soch ke kiya. I was helped by two other policeman.

10-08-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Biryani's new buddy||Biryani is traditionally identified with chicken or mutton. But a quiet revolution seems to be unfolding in the street biryani civilisation, and scores of stalls have sprouted up in the entire Delhi region selling vegetable biryani. Such biryani has rice cooked with lots of peas and gobhi (cauliflower) or any other veggies, and often with one more additional element that gives the dish an illusion, a texture one might say, of “non-veg.” It’s soybean. This is the primary ingredient of almost every veg biryani on the pavement carts. Actually, soybeans embedded in oil-covered glistening rice do look like (undercooked) meat balls.Now, at least one cart in Gurugram is offering yet another radical twist to the biryani. It’s veg biryani served with poori.This afternoon Tika Lal’s modest cart is parked beside the road in Gurugram’s Roshanpura. It has two large pans—one is filled with the soybean biryani, the other is filled with potato curry. “Earlier I was only selling aloo subzi with poori, but after I noticed how popular veg biryani had become in so many stalls, I started serving it too.”Mr Lal introduced the rice dish some time last year, after the lifting of the first coronavirus-triggered lockdown. He supposed that his customers would either pick aloo-poori or biryani for their meal. He hadn’t expected that they would make their own combo by mixing biryani with poori. “That’s what most of my daily customers ask for,” he says. His regulars include lots of rickshaw pullers. “May be because biryani has more vegetables than aloo subzi (which is just aloo and tamatar and gravy)… and who doesn’t like poori?!”It is possible that those of us whose daily life involves intensive physical exertion will take it very naturally to this double consumption of carbs—but then very many of us have both roti-chawal in our meals. Even so, for others, this odd coupling might be slightly disorienting. Whatever, the poori is addictive and biryani is super yummy, speckled not only with soybeans but also with paneer. The vendor sells two poori for ₹10 (you cannot pay for just one) and he charges biryani by measuring it in a weighing scale—200 gm for ₹20. The rice is topped with red chutney and fried green chillies, only on request.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-biryani-s-new-buddy-101628545046861.html
10-08-2021||Delhi||Glam for cam: Men queue up at salons||Gone are the days when only women would wait for lockdown curbs to be lifted, so that they could resume parlour visits. Now, as the pandemic continues, it’s the men who are making a beeline for grooming sessions. Salon owners in Delhi-NCR claim that they are, of late, receiving more requests from men than women. And many are making bookings for themselves to ensure that they are ever ready for the official video calls that have become a crucial part of the #WorkFromHome scenario. So, from hair colour to haircut and mani-pedi to facials, men in the city are opting for everything required to look their best, as the focus is now on the face!“I was very particular about being well dressed for work till the time we were working from office. And honestly, it was much easy because I would dress well and could look sharp. Par ab toh sab ghar par hain, and if I’m not well groomed then it looks so shabby on the camera because only the face is visible during all the meetings with clients,” says Kripneet Singh, a computer engineer, adding that he has been regularly visits salons during the pandemic, “whenever lockdown eases”. “I want to look presentable in the virtual meetings so have started going for face clean-up and beard grooming more often than earlier. After all it’s all about making an impression to stay afloat at the work front,” adds the south Delhi resident. Confirming that Singh isn’t the only one on this bandwagon, Shikha Ahuja, owner of a parlour in Shalimar Bagh, says, “We’ve certainly been getting more bookings from men than women, and this is for various services and not any one in particular. Men need haircuts regularly and many are coming in to get their hair coloured as well. Besides, facials are something that seem to have gained popularity. And most of the men tend to come after their office hours, to avail these services.”Jaya Ahuja, the owner of a salon in Punjabi Bagh, says that men are more particular about what they want. “I’ve noticed that more than women, men know about the hair style they want. Most of them come and brief the hair dresser even before they wear their apron, and start giving detailed instructions of what they want,” she says.But not everyone is opting for salon visits for the need to look presentable on the video screen. Ajay Malviya, a Delhiite who works for a US-based firm, shares how going to a salon for regular grooming sessions helps him relax. “It’s certainly therapeutic to go to a salon. Life hasn’t been easy during the pandemic and I go at least once a week to get my beard coloured, and at least once a fortnight I opt for a pedicure and manicure, which is super relaxing.”Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/glam-for-cam-men-queue-up-at-salons-101628543417824.html

On Monday, the Trust members themselves started to revamp the porch, which does not fall under the ambit of the archaeology department.Trust president Ashok Thapar, who is also a relative of the martyr, said, “The house is 150 years old and requires frequent repairs, but the authorities have turned a blind eye to it. Garbage has also accumulated around the area, and we have been demanding an approach road to the house for long. The MC commissioner met with us today and assured to expedite the work. We hope the project won’t be delayed further.”When contacted, MC commissioner Sabharwal said the building branch has been directed to expedite the process of conducting a social impact assessment, which is required before the land is acquired for constructing an approach road. “The beautification work will commence only after the land is acquired,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-mc-starts-cleaning-area-around-martyr-sukhdev-s-ancestral-house-101628539697746.html

The BKU leader, however, didn’t change his stand and reiterated his political aspirations during his recent tours of different Punjab regions. “Following Charuni’s repeated statements that morcha members should launch mission Punjab and contest polls, we have decided to suspend him for a week,” senior SKM leader Balbir Singh Rajewal had told reporters. Rajewal said Charuni had been telling the Punjab farmers unions leaders to take a political plunge. “We had been telling him that we have no such programme. The SKM was not formed to contest polls but to lead the agitation,” said Rajewal, adding that during the suspension period, Charuni will not be allowed to share the morcha stage and make any statement on behalf of the umbrella body. Charuni, in a video message, had said his suspension was wrong and it won’t change his stand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2022-punjab-polls-charuni-joins-hands-with-traders-to-form-political-outfit-to-be-cm-face-101628538377583.html

The MC employees’ union and members of a few NGOs gathered outside the mayor’s camp office near the Rose Garden on Monday, seeking revocation of the orders but had to return as the mayor was not available. With officers continued to remain tight-lipped, it is being widely speculated that the orders have been passed at the behest of the plastic industry, which wields significant political influence. Highly-placed sources, on condition of anonymity, said that Sekhon was leading a special team formed by the mayor to ensure that the blanket ban on plastic bags was being adhered to when the aide of a high-ranking Congress leader took offence to the raids conducted in the Jawahar Nagar camp area on August 3. The team had reportedly confiscated around 10 quintals of banned plastic carry bags and imposed challans on five shopkeepers in the area, which amounted to ₹1 lakh. After Sekhon refused to soften his stand, matters allegedly came to a head, with the leader’s aide also butting heads with mayor Balkar Sandhu. Later, the Congress leader reportedly took up the matter at the state-level. Foul play is suspected as the transfer orders dated July 30 (before the drive against plastic bags was launched on August 2), was formally received by the MC through email on August 6, after a week’s delay. Also, no more drives against plastic bags were carried out after August 3. Sekhon, who is part of the MC committee, also left for Prayagraj on official tour to study solid waste management on August 5, a day before the transfer orders were received. The team is expected to return on Tuesday. On August 4, representatives of the plastic industry also met the mayor seeking permission to sell 50-micron plastic bags. MC employees’ union chairperson Ashwani Sahota said the employees had gathered to learn the reason behind the transfer. “If it is a routine transfer, we will not object to it. However, if the orders were passed under the plastic industry’s pressure, they must be rolled back.” The union will meet on Tuesday to chalk out an action plan. NGO members have also been garnering support for Sekhon on social media networks alleging that he was transferred for doing his duty. Sikh for Sikhs, NGO member, Gursahib Singh, said, “ Sekhon should not be punished for doing the right thing.” Sekhon, and the mayor were unavailable for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/staff-union-cries-foul-over-ludhiana-mc-secy-s-abrupt-transfer-101628538258624.html

Further investigation is on,” the DGP said. “In the past also, such consignments were dropped in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir from across the border. A probe is on to ascertain the exact target of the consignment. The police are already on toes ahead of Independence Day,” said Gupta.He cautioned the people to remain alert all the time and immediately inform the police if they find any suspicious object lying abandoned or unclaimed anywhere, especially in trains, buses and restaurants. “People can inform the police on the 112 or 181 helplines,” he added. A case was registered under sections 25, 27, 54 and 59 of the Arms Act and sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Explosive Substances Act at the Lopoke police station.Probe points to Pak linkThe police probe in the case has pointed to direct involvement of groups in Pakistan as the tiffin box that was fabricated is sold online on a Karachi -based e-commerce firm hiffy.com. The firm’s contact number +92 2135 899657 is mentioned in the tiffin box. The tiffin brand Bright is widely sold in the neighbouring country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-on-alert-as-drone-dropped-tiffin-bomb-grenades-found-in-amritsar-101628538257443.html

Amritsar senior superintendent of police (SSP) Gulneet Singh Khurana said, “On Sunday morning, we got a call from a resident of Bachiwind village informing that he heard the sound of a flying object at around 12:30 am. He also heard another sound of something falling on the ground.” During the search operation, another villager informed us of a suspicious bag lying near a drain at Daleke village, which is 4.5 km from the border, the SSP added. “It is likely that someone kept the bag there or dropped it near the drain in haste out of fear of getting noticed,” he added. Bachiwind sarpanch Resham Singh said, “Our former sarpanch Gurbhej Singh was working in his fields with some other people on Saturday night. He claimed of having heard the sound of a flying object. He also followed the drone for a few hundred meters. Except Gurbhej and his workers, no one noticed the drone movement in our village. On Sunday, around 200 police personnel searched the village, but didn’t find anything. They found the ammunition at a neighboring village.”Attari DSP Gurpartap Singh Sahota said, “The BSF was not aware of the drone movement. They didn’t open any fire in the area on Saturday night.” Punjab BSF public relations officer (PRO) Kuldeep Singh didn’t respond to repeated phone calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/examritsar-village-sarpanch-notices-drone-movement-bsf-caught-unawares-101628538197957.html
10-08-2021||Chandigarh||Wheat pilferage: Verification of stock in all state godowns begins||The vigilance wing of food and civil supplies department, Punjab, has started physical verification of wheat stock in godowns across the state two days after at least 87,164 quintal grain was found missing from facilities managed by Pungrain at Jadiala Guru. Official sources said district deputy director and district food and civil supplies controller-level officers are likely to face the music for being negligent in physical verification of stock and giving false clearances. “The records are being examined and action will be taken accordingly,” said food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu. After the shortage was detected at Jandiala Guru, three officials — the food department placed district food and supplies officer (DFSO) Amarinder Singh, assistant food and supplies officer (AFSO) Arshdeep Singh and inspector Jasdev Singh — were placed under suspension. Two senior officers — district food and civil supplies controller (DFSC) Raj Rishi Mehra and his predecessor Jasjit Kaur — have been issued a charge sheet to explain negligence in duty. Also, the case was referred to state vigilance department for further investigation. “This is a case of sheer negligence that stock verification was not done properly. If negligence is proved, termination from service is a possibility,” said a top food department officer, requesting anonymity. “We have started verification of stock at other places. Currently, our teams are at Nangli godown in Amritsar district,” said an officer of the department’s vigilance wing. “The report is expected tomorrow,” he added. At least 5 lakh wheat bags weighing around 25,000 tonne are stored in the state. Stock verification at 145 ration depots In Jadiala Guru, vigilance teams have been sent to verify stocks at 145 ration depots that distribute wheat under the Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalian Yojana (PMGKY). As per department records, around 60,000 quintals of wheat was dispatched for distribution from these godowns. At least 1.45 lakh wheat bags weighing 50kg each (87,164 quintal) and 56,000 bags of 30kg each (16,800 quintal) were missing from Jandiala Guru godowns. The total value of the missing grain is pegged at around ₹20 crore. Pungrain insepctor in Dubai Pungrain’s inspector posted at Jandiana Guru Jasdev Singh, who was the in-charge of the godowns, is absconding since the pilferage came to light. He is believed to be in Dubai, sources said. “He is in touch with the food department over email and claims he has not done any wrong and has all documents,” said an officer, who was not willing to be named. He added that the absconding officer has told the department that he’s suffering from coronavirus and was in quarantine. The case has been handed over to the state police and an FIR registered. Efforts are on to bring back and arrest Jasdev Singh, said the officer mentioned above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wheat-pilferage-verification-of-stock-in-all-state-godowns-begins-101628537958257.html

Now, cases of crimes against women, elderly persons and children can also be lodged here.A team of two women police officers have been deputed at all Saanjh Kendras in the city for helping women lodge their complaints. Police stations with no Saanjh Kendras under their jurisdiction can set up a separate room in the area to take such complaints. The initiative has been started under Punjab Police Mahila Mittar (PPMM) scheme.Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, headquarters) Ashwini Gotyal, who is the nodal officer, said, “Sometimes, women hesitate to visit police stations, fearing that male officers may taunt or trouble them. Due to this fear, they keep suffering in silence and are not able to lodge complaints against their perpetrators. So, we have decided to station 65 women cops at Saanjh Kendras across the city so women can approach them for help there.”The ADCP said the scheme was initiated a week ago and they have already started getting complaints from some women in distress. In most cases, women officers counsel the complainants and try to resolve the issue but if it cannot be resolved, the matter is moved to police stations and wings, the ADCP revealed.She added that women can also dial 112 or 181 for police assistance. Cases of thefts, snatchings and other crimes can also be lodged online, through an email.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/now-ludhiana-women-can-lodge-police-complaints-at-saanjh-kendras-101628537957295.html

The civic officials have claimed that the fever cases not related to Covid are also treated as Covid cases at the initial stage and antigen tests are carried out compulsorily at the hospitals and health centres.Although the number of daily Covid cases is under control now at less than 100, the KDMC health department is also focusing on tackling the non-Covid fever and other illnesses like dengue, malaria and typhoid in its vicinity.In June, a total of 2,617 fever cases were recorded while in July, it was 5,000, as per the KDMC health department.“There is an increased number of cases of fever and other illnesses during monsoon that we need to take care of. With the Covid cases reduced, we are still making it mandatory to get Covid tests done, though most test negative,” said Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC.“This is the period when most dengue and malaria cases are reported due to the changing weather. Our staff are doing the survey, providing medicines and also carrying out fogging at breeding spots across the city,” added Panpatil. As of now, the civic body has recorded 10 cases of dengue and 39 cases of malaria between January and July. No deaths related to these diseases have been recorded till date.The spread of the viral fever among the residents of Kalyan-Dombivli has also led to anxiety among them figuring out if the fever was due to Covid-19 infection or not.“Last week, my entire family suffered from viral fever and the symptoms were similar to Covid-19 infection. We carried out the antigen tests that were negative. However, most of us were anxious when we suffered from fever, cough and body ache,” said Sapna Kothari, 45, a resident of Khadakpada in Kalyan (W).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/viral-fever-related-to-monsoon-worrying-residents-of-kalyandombivli-101628537897663.html

10-08-2021||Chandigarh||Ranjit Sagar Dam chopper crash: 7 days on, no clue of missing pilots||It has been a week since an Army Aviation Corps helicopter with two pilots had crashed into Ranjit Sagar Dam lake in Basohli area of Kathua district and with each passing day, chances of the survival of those on board — a lieutenant colonel and a captain — turn more grim. Another team of sea divers of the Indian Navy has been requisitioned from Kerala to join the search operations. The team is likely to reach in a day or two. Kathua senior superintendent of police (SSP) Ramesh Chander Kotwal said, “It’s a technical issue. Deep-water search can’t be mechanical. Though searches are still being conducted by army and navy since day one, there has been no recovery so far.” Kotwal further said, “The water is not clear...it’s all muddy. Naval divers don’t share much technical details but they are using technology, equipment and divers. The lake bottom is muddy and full of silt, boulders, caves besides an uneven surface.” “It is a difficult place to search for a chopper or bodies. The searches are on since August 3 morning. There are 10 to 12 divers at the job to trace the wreckage,” he said. The Kathua police chief said the main wreckage of the chopper hasn’t been located yet. “Once they do it, tracing bodies would be much easier,” he added. Kotwal said the place where the chopper had presumably sunk is around 200ft to 250ft deep. “Releasing water will not make much difference because it is a big lake spread over a vast area. And then, we get water for irrigation and electricity from it,” he added. Officials said multiple factors such as depth of lake, silt, wooden logs, boulders, muddy water, cavities besides poor visibility are adding to the difficulty. A senior army officer said, “On Sunday, additional equipment was taken to the site of crash. The authorities have now sought another team of naval divers from Kerala. They are likely to reach the place in a couple of days.” The officer said, “Sonar technology is being used for the past two days, but it has also not fetched any tangible results so far. There may be small caves beneath and in that case, a helicopter going down with its engine on in one of such cavities makes the task really difficult for the searchers.” Built over the Ravi, 60% of the reservoir of 600MW Ranjit Sagar Dam falls in Jammu. The dam is around 30km from both Pathankot in Punjab and Kathua in Jammu and Kashmir. It is among the highest earth-fill dams in India and has the largest diameter penstock pipes in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ranjit-sagar-dam-chopper-crash-7-days-on-no-clue-of-missing-pilots-101628537780802.html

This despite the fact that the state school education department recently topped the national performance grading index based on the parameters of infrastructure, facilities, access, learning outcomes and governance. The same hall is being used to cook and serve food to students under the Mid-Day Meal scheme. Moreover, there are no separate washrooms for girls and teachers. Besides, the community hall does not have its own power connection. A teacher requesting anonymity said, “It has been over 15 years since the school is functioning from the park community hall. Earlier, the hall was used by local residents for holding functions.” The teachers take 7 classes, including pre-primary, simultaneously in the congested space amid the Covid-19 pandemic. They said it is impossible to adhere to social distancing and other Covid safety norms in the room. The district education department said efforts were being made to resolve the problem and provide a building to the school. Earlier, the school was being run from a serai (dharamshala) in the area. Later, the serai building was declared unsafe and the school was shifted to the community hall. “We have got a temporary electricity connection from a nearby building to run the ceiling fans in this hot weather. The power connection the school earlier had was disconnected as we did not have money to clear the pending bills,” said another teacher. Deputy district education officer (DEO) Gurpreet Kaur said, “Funds have been received for the school building. Land has also been identified for the purpose and construction work will be initiated in a few days.” Moga MLA Harjot Kamal did not respond to repeated calls and messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/moga-govt-school-running-from-community-hall-for-15-years-for-want-of-building-101628537777208.html

Thakur said his government has made good use of every penny donated to fight the epidemic. He appreciated the legislators for contributing their salaries towards the relief measures in the state. The CM intervened in the discussions initiated under Rule 130 and said, “It is wrong on the Opposition’s part to level allegations without facts.” He also took strong exception to the remarks made by Congress’ Jagat Singh Negi on the Prime Minister and said that it was absolutely wrong to say that Narendra Modi has given the free vaccines only after one crore people have been inoculated. Thakur said that the doctors, paramedical staff and front-line workers worked while risking their lives, “so the Opposition should not discourage them”. Earlier, Congress member Inderdutt Lakhanpal introduced a resolution in the House under Rule 130 regarding the impact of the epidemic on the public and steps taken by the government to get rid of it. He said Covid-stricken patients, who were referred to Ner Chowk in Mandi, did not get the required treatment and many of them died. He said there were many patients who died due to scarcity of oxygen. Lakhanpal alleged that the government procured low-quality equipment. Vikramaditya Singh said the government did not keep up the pace required for vaccinating the public against the contagion. He also accused the government of spending extravagantly on the promotion of vaccine and termed it a tactic to gain “cheap popularity”. The CM, however, clarified that not a single penny was spent on publicity regarding the vaccine from the money donated to fight the pandemic. Vikramaditya claimed the first wave was natural, while the second wave was man-made. “If the Himachal government had heeded to suggestions and advice from the doctors, the state could have avoided the terrible situation it faced during the second wave,” he added. BJP’s Narendra Thakur said the present government has fought the battle against coronavirus in a better way and Himachal has stood first in dealing with the virus. “70% people have got the first dose of vaccine and 30% people have been fully vaccinated,” he added. Congress’ Mohan Lal Brakta said if the government had not been negligent in dealing with the situation, then there would not be more than 3,500 deaths in the state. Meanwhile, Vinod Kumar said the state government has provided over 40,000 home isolation kits to Covid patients. CPI(M) MLA Rakesh Singha said the government does not seem to be ready to deal with the possible third wave of coronavirus. He said in the preparation of the third wave, the deficiencies during the second wave should be plugged. “Therefore, steps should be taken for this from now on. If you don’t do the needful, the situation will get worse,” he said, while urging the government to work seriously on the issue. 310 test positive for Covid in stateHimachal on Monday recorded 310 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the state’s tally to 2,08,197 while the death toll mounted to 3,519 after one patient succumbed to the contagion.

Suggestions were submitted regarding size of plots, connectivity, establishment of effluent treatment plants (ETP) and earmarking space to establishing labour quarters among others.Knitwear and Textile Club president Vinod Thapar said, “We have suggested that space be earmarked to establish labour quarters, as it will be difficult to transport labourers to that area. Further, size of the plots to be allocated should not be less than 1,000 square yards.”Rahul Verma from Focal Point Dyeing industry suggested that at present, GLADA is offering a minimum plot of 1 acre at a cost of 1.90 crores, which is very high. Further we have also sought information regarding connecting roads. The authorities should also earmark some space for small and medium industry in the park and a residential colony should also be developed.Members of different NGOs, who have been opposing the project citing damage to the nearby Mattewara forest area and pollution of the Sutlej river , also participated in the meeting.They raised objections over the alleged proposal to establish the park on flood plains of Sutlej river, which is against the norms. Earlier, NGOs had moved National Green Tribunal (NGT) against the proposal.Chief administrator of GLADA, PS Gill, said that hosiery and dyeing industry representatives were invited for their suggestions regarding the upcoming industrial park, which will be spread around 1,000 acres. “The decision regarding whether it will be a textile park or if any other sector has to be involved will be taken by the Punjab Small Industries and Exports Corporation (PSIEC). Suggestions from industrialists have been noted and more such meetings will be held with industrial associations in the coming time. The Mattewara forest will not be damaged as no forest land is being used to establish the industrial park,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mattewara-industrial-park-glada-seeks-suggestions-from-industry-101628537297254.html
10-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: MVA, BJP bicker over decision of allowing vaccinated passengers in locals||A day after the announcement of opening up of local trains for fully vaccinated citizens from August 15, the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA)-led state government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled Central government bickered over the decision. Union minister of state for Railways and former Maharashtra BJP chief Raosaheb Danve said the Railways was not taken into confidence by the state government while announcing the decision. State officials said chief secretary Sitaram Kunte had spoken to senior railway officials before the announcement was made by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Danve on Monday said that though the Railways was ready to cater to the commuters as announced by Thackeray, it would have been better if the Railways administration was taken into confidence. He said that the state government should take the onus of checking the commuters at the entry points of the railway station to verify if they were fully vaccinated.“We are not against operating the local trains for the general public as we have been doing it during lockdown, but had the state government taken us into confidence, it would have been in the interest of the people. The CM has announced the entry into local trains by checking a QR code, but the Railways does not have any such mechanism for verification. The vaccination programme has been implemented by the state and it is the responsibility of the state to verify the vaccination status of eligible commuters. Railways will provide the services, but giving entry at the stations after verification is the responsibility of the state government,” he said in Delhi.Danve was reacting to Thackeray’s announcement of opening up the local trains for the fully vaccinated people from August 15.According to an official from CMO, chief secretary Sitaram Kunte had spoken to general managers of the Western and Central Railways before the announcement. “Divisional railway managers, too, were informed about the decision. We have been holding meetings with railway officials continuously since the beginning of the first lockdown in March 2020. They have, time and again, clarified to us that the decision of opening up of the local trains has to be taken by the state government and they were ready to implement it. Railway officials in Maharashtra are fully aware about the decision and the steps taken by us for its implementation,” he said.Leaders from MVA have strongly reacted to the reaction given by the junior railway minister. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut questioned if the BJP assumes the railways as its personal property. “Railways is national property and does not belong to any specific political party. Is Railways the employee of BJP? The Maharashtra government is a law-abiding government and I am sure they must have followed all protocol while announcing the decision. The minister should first take proper information provided to him (by his ministry) on mobile and email. The decision of opening up local trains for the general public was keeping the interest of the public and the BJP had staged protests demanding for it,” he said.Water resources minister and state NCP chief Jayant Patil said that the BJP should not indulge in one-upmanship over the decision. “The state government has been doing its best to keep Covid-19 under control by extending relaxations from the lockdown in a graded manner,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-mva-bjp-bicker-over-decision-of-allowing-vaccinated-passengers-in-locals-101628537238170.html
10-08-2021||Chandigarh||Let CBI probe paper leaks in Haryana: Surjewala||Congress general secretary and former Haryana minister Randeep Singh Surjewala on Monday demanded that every exam paper leak in state should be investigated by the CBI under the supervision of the Punjab and Haryana high court.Surjewala, who was addressing journalists in context of recent paper leak in police recruitment exam conducted by the Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC), said the HSSC should be sacked and a system of transparent and accountable job recruitment should be put in place by the BJP-led government.Surjewala said, “The HSSC’s recruitment process has become a mockery, which is evident from the absurd, incomprehensible and frivolous questions in the police constable examination. Instead of asking questions related to duties, functions and responsibilities of a constable, senseless questions having no co-relation with police functioning, the Constitution, etc were asked,” he said.“About 8.39 lakh youngsters had applied for the job of constable which means every fifth Haryanvi family has been affected by this recruitment. On August 7, which was the first day of the exam, about 3.5o lakh youth took the exam. It is estimated that an amount of ₹100 crore was incurred by the aspirants and their parents on preparation for the exam, coaching, physical test, exam fee and commutation. And what was the result?” he said.“It is for the 28th time that the paper leak mafia has successfully leaked and sold the paper allegedly with the help of those sitting in the echelons of power,” he added.The Congress leader said the exam paper was openly sold for ₹12-18 lakh to poor youths. He said the Khattar government and the HSSC spends ₹25 crore every year on secrecy of exam.“So where does this money go? The contract to conduct exam has allegedly been given to a Hyderabad-based company. It is natural that contract for conducting all future examinations would also have been given to this company. Since, the said company is under suspicion, how can a fair investigation be conducted? he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/let-cbi-probe-paper-leaks-in-haryana-surjewala-101628537237029.html

10-08-2021||Chandigarh||New Haryana DGP: UPSC to select panel of officers on Aug 12||The Haryana government may appoint a new director general of police (DGP) by next week. The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has scheduled a meeting of the empanelment committee on August 12 to prepare a three-officer panel for selection of the new head of police.The move to appoint new DGP comes in wake of incumbent DGP Manoj Yadava seeking premature repatriation to the intelligence bureau citing career consideration and family requirements. The August 12 meeting will be held in New Delhi and will be presided over by the UPSC chairman or a member.Union home secretary or his nominee, Haryana chief secretary, the outgoing DGP and an officer heading central paramilitary organisations or central police organisations will be members of the empanelment committee.Last month, the state government had sent a proposal containing names of eight IPS officers to the UPSC for short-listing three senior officers. As per directions of the Supreme Court, the state DGP will be selected by the state government from among the three senior-most officers of the department who have been empanelled for promotion to that rank by the UPSC on the basis of their length of service, good record and range of experience for heading the police force.“Once they has been selected for the job, they should have a minimum tenure of two years irrespective of their date of superannuation,” the apex court had said in the landmark 2006 Prakash Singh judgment.The SC had in March 2019 clarified that recommendation for appointment to the post of DGP by the UPSC and preparation of panel should be purely on the basis of merit from officers who have at least six months of service prior to retirement.On paper, seven IPS officers who have put in 30 years of service are eligible for empanelment. They are 1988-batch officer PK Agrawal, 1989-batch’s Mohammad Akil and RC Mishra, 1990-batch’s Shatrujeet Kapoor and Desh Raj Singh, and 1991- batch’s Alok Roy and Sanjeev Kumar Jain.However, the three who will make the cut will be the actual contenders for the job.Top officials said if one makes a realistic assessment based on service record, seniority and range of experience, then only four officers are in contention for making it to the UPSC panel – PK Agrawal, Mohammad Akil, RC Mishra and Shatrujeet Kapoor.After shortlisting three names, the UPSC will send the panel to the state government for selecting the next DGP. The state will have the discretion to pick one officer from the panel and appoint them as the new DGP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/new-haryana-dgp-upsc-to-select-panel-of-officers-on-aug-12-101628536640074.html
10-08-2021||Chandigarh||Reetinder Singh Sodhi wants to give back to cricket||Life has come full circle for former Indian cricketer Reetinder Singh Sodhi. From being one of the most talked about young Indian cricketers to becoming a member of the Punjab Cricket Association’s (PCA’s) cricket advisory committee (CAC), he has come of age. The 40-year-old is enjoying this new role and considers it a way of giving back to the sport. “I was so excited when the PCA appointed me a member of the CAC for the upcoming season. Playing for PCA and then India is something I will always cherish. If I can give back to my state association and assist, then why not?” said Sodhi, who has played 18 ODIs for India. He was made CAC member along with former Indian cricketer Bhupinder Singh Senior and Harpreet Kaur a few months ago. For the first time, state selection panels (men and women) were appointed after conducting interviews and awarded contracts with remuneration. “The credit goes to PCA president Rajinder Gupta, who wanted to give all appointed candidates pay packages. This will bring accountability. The same process will be followed when coaching and support staff members are appointed,” added Sodhi, who played 69 first-class and 109 List-A matches. A hard-hitting batsman and a useful medium pacer, he first burst into the national scene in August 1996 with a superb all-round display (3/34 and 82 not out) as India captain to win the Under-15 World Cup final against Pakistan at the Lord’s cricket ground. A few months later, Patiala’s Sodhi made his first-class debut against Delhi in the Ranji Trophy at the age of 16. He was following in the footsteps of his father Mahesh Inder Singh, who also played the Ranji Trophy for Punjab. “My father is an inspiration and I have learnt a lot from him. If I can serve cricket and assist others, then I am very lucky. PCA is in a great phase with so many great changes happening. The CAC aims to appoint qualified and deserving candidates during the coaches and support staff interviews with transparency,” said Sodhi, who was vice-captain of the Indian team that clinched the U-19 World Cup in 2000 in Sri Lanka and now, he is a BCCI certified referee. PCA will appoint coaches and the support staff for men’s and women’s teams by end of this month. The domestic season starts at the end of September. “By appointing coaches and selectors through a fair process, we are bolstering the system at PCA and adhering to the Lodha Committee suggested rules. I am sure that in the coming years, cricket will benefit from this,” concluded Sodhi, who has also played for Ahmedabad Rockets in the Indian Cricket League and Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/reetinder-singh-sodhi-wants-to-give-back-to-cricket-101628536638387.html
10-08-2021||Chandigarh||Three held for Zirakpur robbery, three still at large||With the arrest of three persons, the Zirakpur police have solved a robbery case where four armed men had robbed cash and jewellery worth ₹15 lakh after holding a mother-son duo and their maid hostage at swordpoint at Sharma Estate in Lohgarh on July 22.Those arrested were identified as Captain Oram Kapil, 29, Naseem Ahmed, 31, and Javed Ahmed, 30, all residents of Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh.Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Satinder Singh said, “There were six persons involved in the robbery. The three arrested confessed to committing the crime. We are hopeful of arresting the other three and recovering the jewellery from them.”The SSP said that the main accused, Kapil, worked as a carpenter at the victims’ house four years back and was aware that the owner works in a bank and always keeps cash at home.Station house officer Onkar Singh Brar said, “We have recovered a car and a motorcycle used in the crime. During the incident, two accused were in the car and the rest were on bikes.”All three were produced before a court, from where they were sent to three-day police remand, he said, adding that they were arrested on a tip-off from informers.On July 22, at 11.30am, four-armed men had entered the house of one Jaydev Goyal, who retired as deputy general manager from Union Bank and is currently working as an assistant manager at Muthoot Finance in Sector 35, Chandigarh.The incident happened when Goyal was not at home. His wife, Naresh Rani, 60, told the police that she, her son, Kapil Goyal, 40, and their maid were home when the accused had struck. Holding a sword against Kapil’s neck, they had demanded all the cash and jewellery in the house. The robbers had then tied them all up and proceeded to rummage the house for more valuables.After holding the trio hostage for an hour, they had decamped with the valuables.Three Ropar men held for robbing car at gunpoint Zirakpur police have arrested three men for robbing a car and ₹25,000 at gunpoint from Vijay Kumar, resident of Sector 66, Mohali, at Aerocity Road on June 24.

10-08-2021||Chandigarh||Nuh judge grants bail to POs, HC terms it ‘grave judicial indiscipline’||The Punjab and Haryana high court has termed an incident of a judicial officer granting bail to proclaimed offenders as “grave judicial indiscipline” warranting disciplinary action against the officer and sent the matter for consideration by the chief justice.The HC bench of justice Manoj Bajaj cancelled bail to six persons granted in June 2020 by the judicial officer and ordered that a copy of the order be sent to registrar general for placing it before the chief justice for further orders on the administrative side.The court was hearing a matter from a Nuh resident who had challenged additional sessions judge, Nuh’s order of granting anticipatory protection to these persons who were declared proclaimed offenders in July 2019 in a 2013 FIR.Upon his complaint, an FIR was registered in November 2013 for unnatural sexual offences under Nagina police station, Mewat against these persons. After FIR, police filed a cancellation report to which the petitioner filed a protest petition.In May 2017, a court summoned these persons for alleged offences of kidnap on his plea. But the trial court found no evidence of unnatural sexual act. The petitioner again preferred appeal on deletion of this offence, which was accepted by the sessions judge in August 2017 and three of the accused were summoned under this offence.Thereafter, during the trial, six accused failed to appear and the court declared them proclaimed offenders in July 2019.Following this, they had filed for anticipatory bail on two occasions but withdrew it and continued to evade hearings but in the meantime, moved a third plea for anticipatory bail before additional sessions judge, Nuh.They were given interim protection from arrest in February 2020. The petitioner challenged the order before the HC which was disposed of with a direction to bring these facts before the judicial officer. But in June, the judicial officer confirmed their anticipatory bails.It was this order he had challenged before the HC arguing that the conduct of the accused persons was completely ignored by judicial officer while accepting their plea.The HC bench observed that the power to grant pre-arrest bail is extraordinary in nature, thus, the concession cannot be granted in a routine manner, but in exceptional cases only.While considering such pleas, court is supposed to examine various factors i.e. nature of accusation, role attributed to accused, punishment for the alleged offences, as well as the conduct of the accused applicant etc and after careful analysis, the said discretion is exercised, keeping in mind the sound judicial principles, the bench added.It added that trial proceedings were much within the knowledge of the accused persons. The judicial officer accepted the prayer without analysing its maintainability or discussing the merits of the case.It said the June 2020 order makes it absolutely clear that the officer exercised discretion in favour of the accused persons, without dealing with the objections raised by the state counsel on them being proclaimed offenders. By now it is well settled law that the accused person who has been declared proclaimed person is not entitled to the concession of pre-arrest bail, the court said, adding that the judicial officer passed an order in an “illegal and arbitrary manner, and that too after a long delay without even seeking explanation for their continuous absence from the trial proceedings”. The officer passed order violating the HC order and without examining maintainability or merits of the application, law on the subject and objections on behalf of the prosecution and it amount to “grave judicial indiscipline warranting disciplinary action against the presiding officer”, the bench said, cancelling the bails and forwarding the matter to the chief justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nuh-judge-grants-bail-to-pos-hc-terms-it-grave-judicial-indiscipline-101628536520118.html

10-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to issue universal pass to enable entry at public places||After an announcement by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to start the local train travel for all fully vaccinated people in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) from August 15, the state government has started preparations for the portal which will enable the commuters to register themselves. The portal will be linked with the Centre’s Co-Win portal for the verification of the information related to the vaccine doses, making the system foolproof and enable the government to use it for access to the holder at other public places such as government offices, malls, theatres and markets.The portal which is expected to begin its dry run in a day or two will be linked with the Co-Win portal for verification. Once both the portals are integrated, the holders will be issued QR code embedded universal pass through which they can obtain their tickets or season tickets. “We have evolved the system to verify the credentials of the holder as we did not want to rely only on the copy of the vaccination certificate, which can easily be faked. Once the registration is done on the Maharashtra government portal, the information will be verified using the application information interface linked with Co-Win and will be certified back to the state portal. The user will then get a link to take a selfie and upload back to the portal for the generation of the universal pass,” said an official from Mantralaya.MMR, which comprises three districts, has 2,453,494 fully vaccinated people as of Monday, according to the state government data. Mumbai has 1,960,495 fully vaccinated people, while in Thane, Raigad and Palghar the number of fully vaccinated people is 982,498, 213,560 and 83,331 respectively. The pass will be certified proof of the person being fully vaccinated. “The QR code on it could be verified by the authorities, including ticket collectors at Railway stations, using mobile cameras in smartphones. They will not have to have any separate mechanism for it. Once proved successful for the issuance of the railway tickets, the universal passes so issued can be utilised for the verification of the fully vaccinated people for relaxations to be given at other public places including malls, markets among others,” the official said.The Central and Western Railway has started their discussions for the implementation of the universal pass with the Maharashtra government. Discussions between the railway authorities and state government officials happened on Monday as well. The railway authorities are tight-lipped on how the universal pass with QR code will be implemented but have stated that all concerns are being raised with the state government.A detailed travel Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for passengers and information regarding universal passes is likely to be made public by Wednesday. “Inspection of the passes and checking on the entry and exit of the railway stations would have to be done. We are discussing all possible scenarios as to how the universal pass can be introduced for passengers. Discussions on how railway staff including ticket checkers, Railway Protection Force(RPF) personnel will be involved in crowd control is also being done.” said a senior railway official who did not want to be named.Passenger associations have welcomed the move and have stated that SOP should be implemented immediately. “We welcome the decision to allow vaccinated passengers to travel by local trains. We had been demanding for a long time. The state government and railways should immediately issue SOP,” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad.The state government officials have held many meetings with the officials from Railways and have arrived at the consensus to evolve the system. “We have taken care to simplify it to make it feasible. For example, since it is not possible to check the credentials of the commuter at the ticket window due to crowding, we are issuing the universal pass which can be easily checked by the TCs at stations. This will encourage people for vaccination and the crowding in the train will increase gradually, only after the number of fully vaccinated people increase,” an official from the CM office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-issue-universal-pass-to-enable-entry-at-public-places-101628536517229.html

10-08-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana to launch ‘state song’ depicting glorious past, rich present||The Manohar Lal Khattar-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) coalition government in Haryana on Monday knocked the doors of prominent Haryanavi poets and writers to compose what will be called a ‘state song’ by August 15.The government plans for the composition – capturing Haryana’s link to the pre-Indus Valley civilisation, Vedic culture, Bhagvat Geeta and Sarswati river – to be sung in local dialect.The poem should also touch participation of Haryanvis in the first war of Independence, freedom struggle and now where Haryana stands in all spheres, including its contribution in defence and sports.“We hope to give our people an inspiring state song to remind them about our glorious past and rich present while giving them a bright vision of the future,” said Suresh, joint director, art and culture affairs.Haryana has set the ball rolling for the state song after a recent communication to the state governments, where the Centre talked of its plans to celebrate 75 years of India’s Independence as ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’ in an inclusive and participatory manner.Sources said the Centre has said a special initiative is being undertaken to create songs connected to each state and UTs in local languages and dialects – celebrating their heroes, major events, and stories of the region’s freedom struggle.“Each state/UT is requested to explore the idea of creating its own freedom song in the local language/dialect as deemed appropriate. The aim is to bring out the hidden stories of India’s journey to freedom by celebrating local unsung heroes, relatively unknown regional events and popular stories worthy of commemoration as part of India @75 activities,” the Union ministry of culture said in its communication.In this backdrop, the Haryana art and cultural affairs department on Monday kicked-off an exercise to invite compositions from writers and poets, who are native of Haryana, for the state song.Interested writers and poets will have to verify their own creation and send it through the department’s email: artandculturalaffairshry@gmail.com by August 15.As the August 15 deadline set for receiving the compositions is too tight, steps are afoot to extend the deadline.The author of the best composition, which will be selected as the state song, will be honoured with a cash award of ₹1 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-to-launch-state-song-depicting-glorious-past-rich-present-101628536397385.html

Based on the complaint the Andheri magistrate court had begun proceedings against Ranaut in February and had issued a bailable warrant in March, the actor appeared before the magistrate and applied for bail, which was granted.The petition filed by Ranaut in HC last month challenges the entire proceeding initiated by the magistrate, including all orders and summons issued to date. It said that the magistrate, instead of simply directing the Juhu police under section 202 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), to conduct an inquiry, was duty-bound to examine Akhtar and the witnesses named in the complaint as per CrPC.“The magistrate failed to appreciate that he was duty-bound to protect the rights and the interests of the proposed accused while hearing any complaint at the stage of inquiry and also at the time of taking cognisance of the complaint,” the petition of Ranaut states. The petition has further said that if such proceedings are allowed, other magistrates will follow it as a precedent and will affect the rights and liberties of other accused. The petition sought a declaration that the statement collected by the police following the magistrate directions was illegal and also sought a stay on the magistrate court proceedings till HC decided her petition.The response by Akhtar has stated that Ranaut’s contentions are baseless and unfounded has also stated that the magistrate followed due process of law before initiating proceedings against Ranaut. Akhtar in his affidavit has stated that the magistrate had initiated proceedings after considering the contentious footage of the interview dated July 19, 2020, and the statement of witnesses. The affidavit further states that perusal of record will prove that due process of law has been followed by the magistrate and there is no infirmity in his orders. The affidavit concludes that the petition by Ranaut was intended to delay the proceedings as she had not appeared before the magistrate on the last five hearings and her petition should be dismissed with exemplary costs. The bench has posted hearing of Ranaut’s petition on August 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/defamtion-case-kangana-ranaut-trying-to-delay-proceeding-javed-akhtar-tells-bombay-hc-101628536157110.html
10-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Maneka Gandhi opposes walk-in aviary near Sukhna||Animal rights activist and politician Maneka Gandhi has written to UT administrator VP Singh Badnore regarding the walk-in bird aviary that is being constructed near the Sukhna Forest, calling it illegal.Gandhi wrote the letter after a city-based activist, RK Garg, highlighted the issue in a letter to her and to the authorities on Monday.As per Gandhi, that the UT administration brought out a tender on July 22 for purchasing 1,500 exotic birds was illegal as the birds were not bred in India and would be smuggled. She added that a collection of animals and birds on display was classified as a zoo, and no zoo could be started without the permission of the Central Zoo Authority.Gandhi also said that the aviary would be like a cage and several high courts including the Punjab and Haryana high court had forbidden the caging of birds.Gandhi added that the city already had an Open Bird Sanctuary in Sector 21 and many people had objected to the project. She further added that the report on this would go to the Prime Minister’s office and the Union ministry of forest, environment and climate change. Garg, in his letter to Gandhi, had highlighted how residents were against the aviary, which would be like a cage for birds: “The quotation for the supply of exotic birds by the administration asks for things like DNA certificate and age certificate of the birds which practically can’t be followed thus I have highlighted the issue.”Meanwhile, the officials of the UT forest department said that the enclosure would be about 58 feet high and spread over 3-4 acres, so it would have ample space for birds. They further added that forest guards posted there would ensure that birds were treated well.The officials pointed out that the government was already constructing aviaries like these in Mumbai and Gujarat. The Sardar Patel Zoological Park and Geodesic Aviary Dome in Kevadia, Gujarat, was inaugurated by the Prime Minister himself in October 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-maneka-gandhi-opposes-walk-in-aviary-near-sukhna-101628536037023.html

But, it is purely on the applicant whether they want to supply their identity or not,” the order read.“An applicant just has to share that much information which is sufficient for supplying the requisite data at a convenient address,” the commissioner said, adding that the grounds taken by the information officer are not legally tenable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/demanding-id-reason-for-rti-plea-illegal-haryana-information-commission-101628535917206.html

Badungar has also requested the Akal Takht, the highest temporal seat of Sikhism, to intervene and stop the razing.In a two-page letter to Akal Takht acting jathedar, Giani Harpreet Singh, Badungar says, “There is no need to demolish the serai, which holds heritage value. The SGPC was constituted to manage affairs and take care of the historic gurdwaras. Even its general House cannot take decisions like this of razing. This organization is not under any other organization or personal asset of any individual.”“The entire Khalsa Panth is the owner of the heritage of the community. If any such decision is to be taken, it can be taken by calling a gathering of all the Sikh organizations and other prominent Sikhs from across the world in presence of the Guru Granth Sahib and Panj Pyare (five beloved ones of Guru) with consent of all,” he said.“Foundation stone of this serai was laid by Sant Baba Sadhu Singh Patiale Wale, in 1931. If any part of anyone’s body fails, we don’t give poison to kill them, but give him medical treatment. Historic buildings need the same treatment,” he said, adding, “Today, architects can renovate these buildings in such a way that their originality remains intact. Panthic circles will strongly oppose this anti-panthic and unnecessary plan. The SGPC should tackle many challenges ahead of it instead. I hope you (jathedar) will fulfil your responsibility in this case.”The Sikh bodies are opposing the demolition, citing that the sarai testifies to historic developments including 1947 partition, Punjabi Suba Movement and Operation Bluestar. Though the SGPC is going to constitute a sub-committee to look into the matter, it has not made any official announcement that the serai would not be razed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/razing-of-historic-serai-former-sgpc-chief-badungar-slams-plan-as-anti-panthic-writes-to-akal-takht-jathedar-101628535857250.html

Apart from this, the department’s revenue collectors will carry point of sale machines to the doorsteps of consumers, who would be able to make cashless payments via cards. The option of cash payments will also be there. “The system is user friendly and totally secure against online frauds,” said the minister, adding that it will not only make bill payment easier for consumers but also boost revenue collection of the department, thereby helping in efficient management of water supply schemes and ensuring uninterrupted supply of potable water in rural pockets. This system has been implemented in collaboration with HDFC Bank, which has provided the technological and banking platform. It will also bring transparency in operation and maintenance of water supply schemes, said the minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-now-rural-consumers-can-pay-water-bills-online-101628535737042.html

CESC is the flagship company of the Kolkata-based industrial and services conglomerate RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group.The report of the empowered committee will now be submitted with the UT administrator for his approval, which will be then forwarded to the Union government. The final decision will rest with the Union Cabinet.Meanwhile, in response to the strike call, the administration said that the principle of “no work, no pay” will be strictly enforced. “The employees are, therefore, advised to attend duty. The defaulting employees will also be liable to other disciplinary action,” said a UT spokesperson.Though necessary arrangements for maintaining the continuity of power supply have been made, chances of snags due to any untoward incident cannot be ruled out, said the spokesperson. In case of any disruption, consumers can contact complaint centres in their areas or the control rooms (0172-2703242, 2740475) besides the citizen facilitation centre (0172-4639999).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-powermen-call-one-day-token-strike-101628535677039.html
10-08-2021||Mumbai||New IT Rules will have chilling effect on editors, authors, petitioners tell Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday was informed that the recently notified Information Technology Rules 2021 under the Information Technology (IT) Act were against free speech and promoted draconian censorship and delegated powers to the authorities that were more than what was intended. Senior journalist Nikhil Wagle and legal news portal Leaflet who have filed challenged the Rules submitted that they will have a terrible chilling effect on the free speech of authors/editors, people at large and hence should be set aside. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni while hearing the two petitions which termed the Rules as arbitrary, illegal and contrary to articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution was informed by senior counsel Daraius Khambatta and advocate Abhay Nevagi that the Rules were against the principle of net neutrality, which is adopted and accepted by all countries including India. The new rules titled Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code for social media platforms and digital news outlets was brought into force in May this year by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. The guidelines issued in February had stipulated that all social media platforms should have a grievances redressal and compliance mechanism which would be done through a resident grievance officer, chief compliance officer and a nodal contact person. The platforms were asked to submit monthly reports on complaints received from users and actions taken on them. The third requirement for instant messaging applications was to make provisions for tracking the first originator of a message and also made the service provider liable for penal action in the event of non-disclosure of information.Senior counsel Khambata, representing the company that owns The Leaflet submitted that new IT Rules were vague, wide, draconian and would have a terrible chilling effect on free speech on authors, editors and anyone who wants to post anything online. He added that the Rules sought to control investigative journalism which would result in journalists not being able to write anything which they cannot prove 100 per cent. He said that while the journalists are expected to be accurate, the Rules could not decide between ‘fair and crass’ and could not control publishers and editors through it. “The rules seek to effectively monitor and censor speech on the internet, the most draconian law on free speech in recent times. They have nothing to do with regulating or recognizing the e-transactions on the internet,” said Khambatta and sought a declaration that the rules were ex facie ultra vires of the constitution of India. He also sought interim relief by staying the application of the Rules till the petition was decided. Advocate Nevagi appearing for Wagle in his PIL said that while messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal were akin to post offices that just delivered letters between the sender and the receiver without opening the letter, the rules allowed authorities to use artificial intelligence mechanisms to access the data or communication sent, leading to misuse of the same. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the Central government submitted that the Supreme Court (SC) was likely to hear the petition which sought transfer of the two petitions in HC to the Apex court on August 10 and urged the Court to wait till SC’s decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/new-it-rules-will-have-chilling-effect-on-editors-authors-petitioners-tell-bombay-hc-101628535617015.html
10-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Abbott Healthcare leases 5,000-sqft space in BKC for ₹9.26 lakh/month||In one of the major realty transactions in recent times, pharmaceutical company Abbott Healthcare has leased a 5,000-square feet apartment in Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) for ₹9.26 lakh per month. Abbott leased this premium residential property – Signature island building constructed by Sunteck Realty – from owner Ramesh Bhatia and Vijaya Bhatia for a period of 36 months. According to the documents scanned by Zapkey.com, a real estate data analytics and research firm, the luxury pad comes with five car parks. In the first 12 months, the rent will be ₹9,26,890, which will be hiked to ₹9,91,770 in the second year and in the last 12 months, it will be ₹10,90,950. “After two years of Covid-19 pandemic, where such high-end deals came to a virtual standstill, we are witnessing leasing activity by corporates,” said Sandeep Reddy, co-founder, Zapkey.com. He cited the examples of MUFG bank which leased the property in Signia Isles in BKC by the same builder in May for ₹5.25 lakh. Another transaction was in June, when Mirae Asset Capital Markets India Private Limited leased an apartment in Signia Pearl for ₹3.75 lakh a month. Signature Island, which is leased by Abbott, is one of the ultra-luxury projects located opposite Trident Hotel in BKC. It has just 3- and 4-BHK (bedroom, hall and kitchen) apartments with amenities such as landscaped garden, multipurpose hall, squash court, jogging track and meditation room. It is a ‘by invitation only’ project. Abbott, which has its corporate office at BKC, will use this apartment to house its senior executive. Real estate expert Ajay Chaturvedi said, “Corporates are being very cautious while taking places on lease and these are very specific in nature. The overall market is still to pick up.” Many well-known personalities namely Uday Kotak, Sonam Kapoor and Aishwarya Rai have all bought apartments from Sunteck builders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-abbott-healthcare-leases-5-000-sqft-space-in-bkc-for-9-26-lakhmonth-101628535498126.html
10-08-2021||Chandigarh||Apartments issue: SC moved against survey order in Chandigarh||A Sector-27 resident has approached the Supreme Court against the high court’s directions to the Chandigarh administration to carry out a survey to identify residential properties partially sold to a person outside the family of the original owner. The plea by Mamta Gupta was taken up by the bench of justices LN Rao and Aniruddha Bose on Monday. However, the detailed order of the proceedings is awaited. Gupta’s argument is that there is no prohibition on multiple individuals, even from distinct families, buying residential units, with a caveat that the construction of the home must be done in a cohesive manner and as a single entity. Once the plans of a house are passed and construction approved by the relevant authorities, how the individual residents within the house reside is firmly within the fundamental right of privacy of those individuals and it would be impermissible for the authorities to adjudicate who must live within the confines of such a house, she has argued, further adding that such a survey should not have been ordered amid the pandemic. The high court last month had sought a survey of properties sold in Chandigarh since December 31, 2019, wherein shares to the extent of 50%, 30% or 20% have been transferred to a person outside the family of the original owner. The court also asked for a physical inspection of such identified buildings to find out as to whether the sale has actually translated into the buyers occupying an independent floor in the otherwise composite dwelling unit. The order had come on a batch of petitions pending since 2016 seeking prohibitory orders on conversion of residential plots into apartments by selling them floor-wise to multiple owners. While the administration has maintained that no permission is being granted, the HC bench itself scanned newspapers and noted that 24 such advertisements scouting for purchasers/investors for separate floors were found on a single day in an English daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/apartments-issue-sc-moved-against-survey-order-in-chandigarh-101628535376985.html

The NEET Examination was postponed, delaying the arrival of fresh batch of postgraduate students. Many universities could not hold the examination for final-year PG students.”He added that it was against this backdrop that the NMC has issued an advisory, facilitating the institutes, in utilising the services of the MD and MS students who had finished their term of three years, till the arrival of the fresh batch of students. “Our advisory makes it clear that these students should be paid stipend and hostel facilities should be continued. This was done to augment the medical man power during the pandemic,” he said.“Unfortunately, we have received many complaints from the students that many institutes are refusing to pay the stipend after their term is over and are also not relieving them. They are holding their documents. This is illegal. Hence, this advisory is being issued,” he said.In the advisory NMC directed all medical colleges that irrespective of the status of examination, postgraduate students should be paid the stipend till their services are availed.“Wherever the examinations have been held and the results are declared, the successful MD, MS and DM, MCh candidates shall be designated as senior residents and assistant professors, respectively, and be paid accordingly,” the advisory reads, adding that if medical institutes do not want their services, they should be relieved and all their documents should be returned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amid-complaints-from-md-ms-students-nmc-issues-advisory-for-medical-colleges-101628535319274.html

The court said that the magistrate court had properly quoted material on record and had given proper reasoning.MRA Marg police had filed the closure report in March 2020, after probing the complaint filed by Rajendran Neruparambil, chief financial officer of ATIPL against Jet Airways and the Goyals.Neruparambil had alleged that in 2018-19, Jet Airways owed ATIPL ₹46.05 crore. He further alleged that the Goyals’ had engaged ATIPL in business despite being aware of the financial crisis faced by the airline, which shut operations in April 2019 and had accumulated debt of nearly ₹8,500 crore.After conducting a probe, MRA Marg police filed a closure report in March, having found no evidence of cheating; and sought closure on the grounds that it was a civil case. ATIPL had questioned the closure report and had filed a protest petition seeking re-investigation. The magistrate court had in December 2020 rejected the protest petition of ATIPL and closed the case by accepting the closure report. Against the order of the magistrate court, ATIPL had moved the sessions court.ATIPL had contended that ‘the respondents (Jet Airways and its directors) despite knowing that the company is heading for eventual collapses, fraudulently induced the applicant’s company to invest with them for their benefit and wrongful loss to the applicant company.’The lawyers for Jet Airways had argued that there would not have been smooth business between applicant and respondent no.2 till October-2018 though an agreement was executed, which is in question dated April 01, 2018.The court considering this held, “by no stretch of the imagination I can arrive at a conclusion that since 01/04/2018 the respondent No. 2 to 4 were having the intention to cheat the applicant and that’s why only has given an offer of incentive though they were aware that the respondent no.2 is running into losses.’The airways had also pleaded that the matter about the financial disputes was before The National Company Law Tribunal. The court was informed that the NCLT has approved the resolution plan for Jet Airways.Hence the court said, “once the Resolution Plan is approved by Hon’ble NCLT then immunity is given to company under the said act for an offence committed prior to commencement of said of resolution of the plan. As such considering the immunity given under section 32-A of Insolvency Act and Bankruptcy Code amendment act 2020, no case for any offence committed by the said company prior to Resolution Plan cannot be taken up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cheating-case-against-jet-airways-directors-court-rejects-closure-petition-101628535318220.html

In the week ending August 4, Mumbai recorded a 69% deficit in rain, seeing just 48.8mm of precipitation against the seasonal normal of 160mm.The dry spell has also seen a steady rise in temperatures since August 4, with Monday’s daytime maximum at 32.5 degrees Celsius (up from 30.4 degrees Celsius a week ago). This is the third time in a decade that August temperatures have touched 32.5 degrees Celsius, and follows last year’s 10-year high of 33.5 degrees Celsius (on August 3). The city had previously touched a daytime high of 33.5 degrees Celsius (a record for August) on August 26, 1969.As per the India Meteorological Department’s seven-day forecast for the city, “generally cloudy sky with moderate rain” is expected until at least August 13. With higher chances of rain expected August 14 onward, a dip in temperature is also expected around that time. The relative humidity, meanwhile, dipped from 90% a week ago to 74% on Monday. “The humidity has dipped because the temperature is rising and rain is not adding moisture to the air,” said a meteorologist with the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai.The ongoing break in the monsoon, IMD officials said, is due to the lack of any sustained large scale weather systems in the region. With no vigorous monsoon trough in the vicinity, and without any low pressure systems in the Bay of Bengal, the influence of rain bearing westerly winds has become subdued, with a chance of revival only after August 14. Until then below normal rains are likely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-hot-humid-conditions-to-remain-for-a-week-101628535078224.html

10-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra forest department yet to ask for mangrove count for NMIIA||Amid the push for transfer of mangroves to the state for safekeeping, the forest department is yet to ask the now denotified Navi Mumbai Special Economic Zone (NMSEZ) for assessment of the mangrove cover on its 1,250-hectare property in Uran, Raigad district. This is despite evidence of mangrove cover on the land, say environmentalists, who have been tracking the destruction of wetlands in Uran taluka. The erstwhile NMSEZ entity, which migrated to an Integrated Industrial Area (IIA) in March 2019 under the state’s industrial policy, has previously been pulled up by the Raigad administration and forest department for destruction of an estimated 4,500 mangroves in Pagote. A government official privy to the matter, preferring anonymity, said that as the NMIIA is a public-private-partnership (PPP) between City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) and three other private entities, it is being treated as private land. “The state has no jurisdiction to take over the mangroves there, unlike in case of other public entities such as the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority, Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation or municipalities,” the official said. A representative of the erstwhile NMSEZ did not respond to request for a comment on Monday. Despite attempts, HT was unable to contact Cidco’s newly appointed environment officer for a response. Environmentalists, however, pointed out that state-run Cidco continues to hold 26% equity in the NMIIA. “Cidco handed over 282 hectares of mangroves in Raigad district to the forest department earlier this month. It should also assess and hand over the mangroves on the NMIIA land,” said BN Kumar, environmentalist with the Navi Mumbai-based NatConnect Foundation. Moreover, NMIIA has not been included as a respondent in a recent public interest litigation filed by NGO Vanashakti, seeking compliance with the Bombay High Court’s 2018 judgment, ordering transfer of all mangroves in Maharashtra to the government. Stalin D, director of Vanashakti, clarified, “This is because Cidco has been included as a respondent. They are still the custodians of the land which has been leased out for the integrated industrial area.” NatConnect has now written to the chief minister to look into this anomaly, and called for an inspection of the property on the basis of the existing coastal zone management plan (CZMP) maps, which indicate presence of mangroves across Cidco’s Dronagiri node in Navi Mumbai, Panje, Pagote, Kunde and other spots. The CMO, on August 7, forwarded the inquiry to the forest and environment departments for further action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-forest-department-yet-to-ask-for-mangrove-count-for-nmiia-101628534836952.html

While two of them kept sitting in the car, the other two chased Vicky and fired at him repeatedly as he was about to sit in his SUV around 10:30am. After the attack, the assailants had fled towards Kharar via Sector 76, the investigations have revealed. According to the a senior police officer, privy to the investigations, one of the shooters and a man who was sitting in the car have been identified. “We will be disclosing the names soon,” said the cop.Sources said police suspect the murder was executed by the same men who killed Youth Congress leader Sukhmeet Singh Deputy in Jalandhar on June 20, as the style and sequence of both crimes were identical. Meanwhile, senior superintendent of police Satinder Singh, who is leading the investigations said: “We have got vital leads and are very close to cracking the case.” In the past two days, police have questioned around 25 persons, who are associated with gangster Gaurav Patial, alias Lucky, the prime suspect. He is at present lodged in jail in Armenia, from where he is reported to be running the operations of the Davinder Bambiha gang, which has claimed responsibility for Vicky’s murder. On Monday, the Mohali police also brought gangster Sukhpreet Budda, who is Lucky’s close aide, for questioning from the Sangrur jail. He has been lodged there since January 2020.Hours after the murder on Saturday, the Bambiha gang had taken responsibility for the attack in a Facebook post. It claimed that Vicky was killed as he was allegedly acting as an “informer” for the rival Lawrence Bishnoi gang. Both gangs are running extortion racket in the region. A day before Vicky’s murder, police in the neighbouring Panchkula district had also arrested two sharp shooters of the Bambiha gang, who were allegedly planning to eliminate Bishnoi gang members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/youth-akali-leader-s-murder-two-attackers-identified-say-mohali-police-101628534717151.html

The murder was committed on July 30.The girl stayed with her mother (a home maker), father (an engineer) and six-year-old brother. The parents of the juvenile wanted her to become a doctor and had enrolled her for the NEET classes. On July 27, her father scolded her for playing on the phone following which she left the house and went to her uncle’s house nearby. The mother then went and called her back to which the daughter said that she was fed up of the harassment over studies and would go to police station to file a complaint against them. The mother then took the daughter directly to the police station, after which the police counselled them.On July 30, at around 2.30pm, the mother started shouting at the girl over studies again. During the fight, the mother took out a knife to threaten the girl. “The girl thought that the mother was going to kill her and she pushed her following which the mother got a head injury as she hit the corner of a cot. The mother was semi-conscious and tried to grab a karate belt that was lying nearby. On seeing this, the girl grabbed the belt and strangulated the mother till she died,” an officer from Rabale police station said.After making sure that she died, the girl used her mother’s phone and sent a WhatsApp message to her father and uncle saying ‘I tried everything I quit’. She then took the key of the latch from the outside of the door and inserted it from the inside and closed the door. The girl then called her father on phone and told that the mother was not opening the door. The father, who was at office, informed the uncle who went home and kicked open the door to find his sister lying dead on the bed with the karate belt around her neck.“The police officials were doubtful about it being a suicide due to the way the body was lying. After interrogating all the family members, we suspected the girl. After we took her into confidence, she narrated what happened,” senior police inspector Yogesh Gawade said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-15-year-old-girl-booked-for-killing-mother-over-studies-101628534658423.html

10-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man arrested for bid to kill daughter, staging son’s death to bring back estranged wife||The Kurar police on Sunday arrested a man for trying to kill his 13-year-old daughter and staging the death of his eight-year-old son to bring back his estranged wife from her village. Police officers said that complainant Suchita Gaud told them that her brother was an alcoholic who used to assault his wife and children. She told police that two years ago, Ajay’s wife left for her village and did not return. On Sunday, Gaud called his wife and informed her that their son had died and daughter had committed suicide. The officers said that he sent his wife a picture of their son’s framed photo with a garland on it and covered him in a white bedsheet. He then made his daughter climb on a bucket and put a noose hanging from the ceiling fan around her neck. He then allegedly tried to kill the girl by pushing the bucket away, but she started to scream that she did not want to die. Hearing her cries, neighbours gathered outside the house and broke open the door. They contacted the Kurar police and reported the incident.

10-08-2021||Other||Ganga, Yamuna flowing above danger mark in Prayagraj||: The Ganga and the Yamuna crossed danger mark (84.73mts) in Prayagraj on Monday morning. With the water still rising in both the rivers and inundating fresh areas on its banks, district administration has begun evacuating affected families and moving them to safer places and to flood-relief camps. The water level in river Ganga as recorded at 8am at Phaphamau was 85.08 mts while at Chhatnag, it was 84.29 mt. Likewise, water level of Yamuna at Naini was recorded at 84.90 mt. Water level in both Ganga and Yamuna increased with a pace of around 6cm every two hours. Because of the rising water, the water level at all the three recording points of the rivers (as recorded at 4pm) increased to 85.27 mt at Phaphamau and 84.49 mt at Chhatnag. Water level of Yamuna was recorded at 85.13mts at Naini. The water level, as recorded by the irrigation department, is still increasing at a rate of 4cm at Phaphamau, 3cm at Chhatnag (Ganga) and 6cm in Naini (Yamuna). With the increase in volume of water in both the rivers, flood water has entered further into the localities that are already affected, including Ganga Nagar, Nevada, Ashok Nagar, Beli Gaon, parts of Rajapur, Salori, Bada and Chota Baghara, Badra and Sanauti, Daraganj and Nagvasuki etc. Similarly, with the level of water increasing in Yamuna, flood water has reached the Baradari on the banks of Yamuna at Baluaghat, Gaus nagar, JK Ashiana, parts of Karelabagh and other areas located on the banks of Yamuna. Several flood relief camps setup by the administration are providing facilities to flood affected people. Meanwhile, administration and NDRF (national disaster relief force) is helping the locals to shift to safer places as well as keeping a strict vigil on the flood level. “We are keeping a close watch on the water level and since the water level in the upstream of Yamuna is increasing, the same trend would continue here at Prayagraj and further downstream towards Varanasi”, said executive engineer of irrigation department, Brijesh Kumar Verma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ganga-yamuna-flowing-above-danger-mark-in-prayagraj-101628534358278.html
10-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: No processions on Muharram amid Covid pandemic||In the wake of the Covid pandemic, the Maharashtra government on Monday ordered people to observe Muharram in a simple manner and without any procession to avoid crowding. This is the second consecutive year when no religious processions are allowed for any community in the state. The state also said that people living in one housing society are also not allowed to gather for mourning and they should mourn inside their homes. Muharram is observed by Muslims with abstinence and prayers to mourn the martyrdom of Hazrat Imam Hussain in the battle of Karbala in the seventh century. It marks the first and one of the sacred months of the Islamic calendar. It will be observed on August 18 and 19. “In line with the ban imposed on social and religious programmes by the Centre and the state government, the processions will not be allowed this year. People are expected to mourn inside their homes…,” states the circular. The state has also prohibited taking out Tazia (a replica of the tomb of Imam Hussain) to observe Muharram. For setting up ‘Sabeels’ (stalls that provide free drinking water), permission should be obtained from the local administration and not more than two persons are allowed to be present there. Water should be distributed only in sealed bottles from ‘Sabeels’ and cleanliness along with Covid protocols should be observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-no-processions-on-muharram-amid-covid-pandemic-101628534057294.html
10-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai sees dip in reporting of adverse events post Covid-19 vaccination||Mumbai has recorded a drastic drop in reporting of adverse events post Covid-19 vaccinations over the past several weeks. Civic officials said the initial fear and anxiety associated with the vaccines and their common side effects have settled down resulting in the drop in reports of adverse events. However, medical experts warn that such a trend may eventually lead to missing out on severe Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI). In the first few months after the Covid-19 vaccination drive began on January 16, the city recorded anywhere between 5 to 15 adverse events every day. However, the daily reporting on most days now is zero. For instance, between August 1 to 7, Mumbai administered 2.91 lakh doses and recorded only seven adverse events (six with Covishield and one with Covaxin). Similarly, in the last week of July, the city administered 4.98 lakh doses and recorded 10 adverse events (all with Covishield).AEFI’s are classified into minor, severe and serious events. Any adverse event that leads to hospitalisation is considered a serious event. “In the initial days, there was a lot of fear associated with the vaccine, not just among the public but also among the vaccination centres,” said Dr Mukesh Agarwal, chairperson of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) AEFI committee. “Therefore, centres were admitting people with all kinds of common side effects like fever, headache etc. Because of the hospitalisation, a lot of these minor adverse events were being counted as serious events,” he said. Minor AEFI’s consisting of the common side effects like fever, mild headache, pain and swelling at the site of the injection are not actively investigated. However, all serious AEFI’s have to be investigated by the AEFI committee. Earlier the committee would investigate anywhere between 30 to 40 serious AEFI cases in a month, as many minor cases were getting hospitalised as well. Since May, the numbers dropped drastically with no cases coming up for analysis for several weeks. Mumbai has so far administered over 7.5 million doses. According to the civic data up to June, nearly 990 adverse events and 24 fatalities have been recorded in the city. About 66 adverse events were in the severe and serious category. “A robust AEFI reporting mechanism is crucial and it should be promoted widely among the people who are getting vaccinated,” said immunisation expert Dr Naveen Thacker. “But in most cities or districts, people don’t have easy access to this information,” he said. According to Thacker, not just serious adverse events, people should be able to easily report minor events as well. A senior health official said that one of the many reasons for low AEFI reporting is ‘vaccinators fatigue’. “There is a possibility that vaccinators get calls from people, but they are not recording it in the system. Many of these may be minor or severe AEFI’s. The vaccinators have been working nonstop since the drive began, and it’s obvious for such fatigue to set in.” The official said that while some minor and severe events may go unreported, deaths post-vaccination don’t go unreported. *How are AEFI’s classified? Minor AEFI: Fever, mild headache, pain and swelling at the site of the injection, irritability are some of the common side effects of the Covid-19 vaccines. Any such side effects that don’t require active treatment and subside in a day or two are classified as minor events. In such events, paracetamol can be used to alleviate the symptoms. Severe AEFI: Any event post-vaccination that requires some medical intervention but not hospitalisation can be classified as a severe event. For example, if swelling at the site of the injection becomes an abscess and the person has to be put on medication for it. Serious AEFI: Any event that requires hospitalisation is classified as a serious event. These can also be events that are seen in clusters or that lead to death. *Reporting AEFI -Adverse events seen within a half-hour of vaccination are recorded directly in the observation area -One can report adverse events at the vaccination centre or to the vaccinator directly. -If standalone vaccination centres don’t have any contact information, adverse events can be reported to the ward war rooms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-dip-in-reporting-of-adverse-events-post-covid-19-vaccination-101628533936986.html
10-08-2021||Delhi||Legal drinking age brought down to bring parity with other states: Delhi govt||New Delhi: The Delhi government on Monday informed the Delhi high court that the decision to bring down the legal age for drinking in the national capital was taken to have parity with other states, especially neighbouring cities such as Noida and Ghaziabad.Delhi was one of only six states or union territories that pegged the benchmark at 25. An expert committee set up by the government recommended in December that the legal drinking age be changed to 21.Announcing the new age in March, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia also said that government will introduce the system of “age-gating” in the city wherein persons below 21 years will not be allowed to enter any restaurant, pub or club that serves liquor by themselves. The change in rules is part of the new Delhi excise policy which aims to reform the city’s liquor business by improving user experience, cleaning up the liquor mafia and eradicating pilferage.In an affidavit before a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh, the Delhi government said a Group of Ministers (GoM) received many suggestions to end the disparity between the business practices carried out in Delhi and neighbouring cities such as Gurugram, Noida, Ghaziabad and Faridabad such as minimum age of person who can be served liquor, dry days, time restrictions, etc.The 606-page affidavit, filed by standing counsel (civil) Santosh Kumar Tripathi, said, “……the state will ensure sufficient checks and balance which are in place viz. age profiling of the people who are placing order(s) vide proper check of government issued identification.” It is also stated that in States of West Bengal and Orissa, similar amendments have been made in their excise rules and accordingly the same can be implemented in the State of Delhi whilst ensuing compliance of necessary conditions as it may deem fit.The GoM was constituted by Delhi Cabinet on February 5, 2021 to examine all aspects of current system, report of the expert committee and the suggestions/feedback/ comments received from the stakeholders/general public.The GoM recommended that legal age for drinking should be brought in line with majority of states in India such as Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand and West Bengal etc.The Delhi government’s affidavit was filed in response to a bunch of petitions challenging the new excise policy of Delhi, including one by All India Bhrashtachar Virodhi Morcha which challenged the provision to reduce the legal drinking age.On Monday, the court adjourned till August 27 other petitions, challenging the new excise policy, and granted time to the Delhi government to bring on record its counter affidavit.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing Delhi government, informed the court that ₹10,000 crore has been earned by Delhi” pursuant to the new excise policy.Such revenue is higher than most states in India, Singhvi said.The Delhi government has already earned ₹5,300 crore from auctioning alcohol licences for 20 of the city’s 32 zones and looks set to double its excise revenue by netting a record ₹10,000 crore in the first few months of the new liberalised liquor policy.The city government has also defended its decision to allow the home delivery of liquor, citing a Supreme Court judgment of May 8, 2020 allowing states to consider non-direct sale including online sale/home delivery of liquor.Opposing a plea by BJP MP Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma, who has challenged the provision to allow home delivery of liquor, the Delhi government said the provision will result in less overcrowding outside the liquor store/shops.Defending its ambitious liquor policy, the city government said that it will bring ease of doing business by eliminating cartelization, proxy players.The city government also said that it took a policy decision to exit from the business of sale of liquor, in consonance with the GoM’s recommendation that the government has no business to be selling alcohol and that it should completely exit the liquor trade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/legal-drinking-age-brought-down-to-bring-parity-with-other-states-delhi-govt-tells-hc-101628532798309.html
10-08-2021||Delhi||Experts call for system to bridge DU's digital divide||Even as admissions to Delhi University’s undergraduate courses began on August 2, experts feel the lack of a centralised system to track students requiring assistance to access online classes will affect many as colleges do not follow a uniform procedure to identify them.Though university officials said that collecting this data during the registration process may discourage aspirants from applying to DU, several stakeholders and experts said educational institutes need to formulate a uniform plan to track students affected by the digital divide.Educational institutes have been shut down in the Capital since March last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, moving the teaching-learning process online. Even as many students reported challenges while pursuing online education, the tragic death by suicide of a 19-year-old undergraduate student from Lady Shri Ram College for Women in November, allegedly due to a lack of devices to attend online classes and losing her hostel seat over policy changes, jolted colleges and universities across the capital into action.For instance, LSR also set up a digital inclusion club along with reaching out to students with financial and mental health support.Students’ union president Karthika Sajeev, a final-year student of political science, said, “As a means to ensure that the incident wasn’t repeated, we have a digital inclusion club led by college administration and supported by our alumni. Through this club, college tries to identify students who don’t have a laptop. We also have a tech-support group where students can reach out if they have issues and we can assign someone to help them.”Several DU colleges, including LSR, St Stephen’s College, Hindu College, Miranda House and Ramjas College, have offered scholarships to needy students and arranged for devices by roping in alumni members, wherever required, along with forming task forces to address the matter.However, its implementation has been patchy as only a few DU colleges have systems in place to track students who require laptops or internet data packs to attend online classes during the pandemic. Most colleges continue to put the onus of asking for assistance on students, which many feel might leave some students behind.Educationist Meeta Sengupta said that maintaining such data on students and studying how each student accesses the internet will help institutes in devising hybrid teaching-learning plans as well. “Ideally, universities and colleges should conduct a survey once the admission is confirmed and develop a mechanism to find out where each student stands. Along with lack of devices and internet, educational institutes also have to understand how students having these facilities are using it so that they can design teaching plans accordingly,” she said.University officials, however, feel the move may deter applicants. Rajeev Gupta, dean of students’ welfare, said, “Asking for such information may discourage students from applying as they may think that they need these things to fit into DU. We have to consider that aspect as well. Once they are admitted into colleges, they can reach out to college administration asking for assistance. The laptops distributed under the FYUP (four year undergraduate programme) schemes are still with colleges and they can be given to needy students.”Most colleges HT spoke to said they have asked students to write to them in case they needed help, but such help will require outstation students to visit to campus at least once to collect the devices, which may not be easy for all.DU executive council member Seema Das further said that it is not prudent to expect all students to know about their rights to access education. “Those from marginalised backgrounds may not have the awareness that they can seek help from the system. These are just 18- or 19-year-olds who have no idea that they have a right to education and can ask for assistance. It will be better to formulate a survey to find out how many students need help. We also have to account for the financial distress of the pandemic and see how the cost of education has gone up in terms of internet charges. Students had to buy devices to continue their education even if it meant taking loans,” she said.Falit Sijariya, a second-year student of St Stephen’s College (SSC), said that he learned about his college offering laptops to those in need only after he returned to the hostel in January this year. “There is no proper mechanism for college to track students who don’t have devices. It was working on a word-of-mouth basis. It is only after I started living on campus that my seniors told me about this provision and we were able to tell others on how to go about this process,” he said.Teachers have also called for streamlining the assistance schemes, ahead of the new academic session.Former DU teachers’ association president Nandita Narain, who is also the teachers’ representative of SSC governing body, said that the college departments were asked to send in names of needy students. “But this has happened only once in the previous academic cycle. Instead of expecting students to reach out to us, we should reach out to them. Before the classes begin for the new batch of students, a transparent and proper mechanism for providing assistance to students should be developed,” she said.A handful of DU colleges, including Aryabhatta College, are among the few institutes augmenting their existing systems to ensure that they are prepared for the upcoming batch. Principal Manoj Sinha, who is also the general secretary of the DU principals’ association, said, “We distributed around 300 laptops in the last academic cycle and are preparing for around 500 devices in the current academic session. While it is difficult to maintain class-wise data, we have been sending emails to students and asking teachers-in-charge to get in touch with each class so that we are able to reach all students.”Aurobindo College principal said that when they sent out the email, only a few first-year students came to college to collect the laptops. “The attendance for online classes has been more than that for offline classes. This means that all students have access to devices and have been attending lessons. We had sent out an email to students last year asking them to collect laptops from the college if they needed them. However, there is no mechanism in place for outstation students,” he said.Experts, however, said that attendance cannot be a parameter for the accessibility, with Sengupta pointing out that a student may access classes on their phone but the quality of the internet or the device may not aid learning. “There are students who may not be able to follow the full lecture if their internet connection is poor. Though they will be marked as present, their learning process is being hampered. This is where the data, if recorded, could help. Teachers could form learning plans based on the kind of internet access and availability the students have. This can be used after the pandemic as well,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/as-du-admissions-begin-many-in-delhi-call-for-a-centralised-system-to-track-students-affected-by-digital-learning-divide-101628532616294.html
10-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt outlines guidelines for students of classes 10-12 to return to school||Vaccinating teachers on priority, explicit consent from parents of students willing to attend school, and restrictions on sharing stationery or books in classrooms — these are among the guidelines the state education department recommended for institutions to thwart the spread of Covid-19, a day after the Delhi Disaster Management Authority allowed students of classes 10, 11 and 12 to visit school for admissions and board exam-related work.“Online classes/digital distance learning will continue and students who wish to continue their studies through online classes will be allowed to do so. The concerned head of school shall make specific schedules as per the capacity of the classroom/labs following Covid-appropriate behaviour,” the directorate of education said in a circular issued to all schools on Monday.All willing students between classes 10 and 12 will be allowed to visit schools, except students and staff members from containment zones.Everyone on premises will be required to stay socially distant and wear masks all the time, said the guidelines.“Proper sanitisation of school premises including frequent sanitisation of common areas like washrooms etc shall be ensured by the head of school concerned,” the circular added.Schools have also been directed to thermally screen all staff members and students, and those with flu-like symptoms will be asked to return. Teachers will be deputed at school gates during entry and exit periods to ensure distancing protocols are followed even outside the school’s premises. When classes resumed briefly between January and February this year for students of classes 9 to 12, several principals and teachers flagged the issue of overcrowding outside schools.With the Capital’s Covid-19 caseload at a nearly 16-month low, several schools and parents inquired with the government if schools will reopen for senior students. This is mainly because of the two-term board examination introduced by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) this year to prepare for an “unprecedented situation” arising due to the pandemic next year. The first set of board examinations for Class 10 and 12 students is set to take place between November and December this year.However, government schools and several private schools in the Capital, including The Indian Public School, Modern Public School in Shalimar Bagh, Army Public School in Shankar Vihar, Amity International School in Pushp Vihar, said they are not likely to open before next week.Principals explained that while standard operating protocols were drawn up in January this year, schools needed to acquire consent forms from parents and hold sessions to ease the students back to school. Preparing laboratories and working out a schedule with teachers to allot students into small groups will take a few days, schools said.“Our school has also planned that only teachers at least partially vaccinated will be allowed to come to school. Our priority will be Class 12 students. We will issue consent slips to parents in a day or two and will decide upon the batches based on the responses. We will give parents time to think about it after informing them of the safety protocols being put in place. It is likely that we will open by next week,” said Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School.Malini Narayanan, principal of Army Public School in Shankar Vihar and chairperson of National Progressive Schools’ Conference, which has 122 schools under it, said, “Most of our schools will start calling students from next week. Our laboratories are large enough and we have started the sanitisation process already. We will not run buses or call students every day. Children will come once or twice a week and can catch up on the remaining work at home. We have conducted walk-throughs with parents to ensure they are confident of sending their children to school.”Not all schools in the city are keen on calling back students now, though.Madhulika Sen, director of Tagore International School, said, “We are supposed to call them for any of three reasons — counselling, practicals, or admission formalities. All of these can be done online. Our practical work has been scheduled for between September-October so we will call students then. If students want to come for counselling, only that will be allowed.”Government schools in the Capital have also begun the process of consultation with students and teachers. The education department has asked district deputy directors of education (DDEs) to vaccinate teachers and school staff by August 23. Several Delhi government schools are also serving as vaccination centres and will have to take special care to arrange for classes.Government school principal Sukhbir Singh Yadav, president of Vice and Principals’ Association of Delhi, said they will start classes from August 16. “We have around three vaccination sites and require only three rooms for the process and that can be conducted in the primary wing. We will have separate entry-exit points for those coming to get vaccinated and those coming for academic activities along with supervision. Initially, we will start with teachers demonstrating the practicals and students can just observe. Students will be divided into smaller groups to hold practicals,” he said.Class 11 admission process has already started in Delhi government schools, and it will take around a month to complete the formalities, principals said. Government school students will have to come to school to discuss their subject interests based on their class 10 scores for the admission process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-outlines-guidelines-for-students-of-classes-10-12-to-return-to-school-for-admissions-or-board-exam-work-101628532556207.html
10-08-2021||Delhi||4 of crowd that raised anti-Muslim slogans at Jantar Mantar identified||The Delhi Police on Monday said they have registered a first information report (FIR) in connection with a video circulating on social media in which some people are seen raising anti-Muslim and inflammatory slogans near Jantar Mantar in central Delhi on Sunday.The police added that they have identified four suspects who are seen in the video raising communal and inflammatory slogans. A senior officer who asked not to be named said raids are being conducted in Delhi, Ghaziabad, Noida and Gurugram to nab the suspects.The slogans were raised purportedly at an event organised on Sunday to demand abolition of colonial-era laws. The officer said the organisers, including former Delhi BJP spokersperson and Supreme Court lawyer Ashwini Upadhyay may be asked to join the investigation.The FIR has been registered against unknown persons under Indian Penal Code’s (IPC) sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) at the Connaught Place police station.“A case has been registered against relevant sections of law in the Sunday’s matter. Investigation is in progress,” said deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav.The purported video was circulated on social media with allegations that the communal sloganeering took place during the event organised on Sunday at a road near Jantar Mantar by Upadhyay under the banner of Bharat Jodo Andolan (unite India movement). Police said permission was not granted for holding the event.Upadhyay refuted the allegations, saying that inflammatory slogans were not raised during the event that started around 11am and was over by noon.“We started our event at 11am, and left after concluding it at noon, because the crowd started swelling up. No inflammatory slogans were raised during our event. If the video is genuine, I believe that the sloganeering may have happened either before our event or afterwards. I learnt about the video around 8pm on Sunday, when it was circulated on social media and some people started tagging me with intent to defame me. I don’t know the people sloganeering in the video, have never met them, nor they were called for the event,” said Upadhyay.Many people, including Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, criticised the incident and have sought police action. “What a disgrace to read of an unauthorised BJP demonstration where communal slogans & hate speech were voiced…Expecting exemplary action from @DelhiPolice – only stern action & condign punishment will prevent such misbehaviour recurring,” Tharoor tweeted on Monday morning.Dissociating himself from the communal sloganeering and the suspects, Upadhyay said he has filed a written complaint with DCP (New Delhi), seeking an investigation to verify the authenticity of the video and strict action against the people for spreading “religious frenzy”.Shipra Srivastava, media in-charge of Bharat Jodo Aandolan, also denied any links to those who raised anti-Muslim slogans. “The protest was held to demand abolishing 222 British laws. We have seen the video, but have no idea who they are. The police should take strict action against the persons who raised the slogans,” she said.A police officer said, “A huge crowd turned up for the event and the number was constantly increasing. The Covid-19 guidelines such as maintaining social distancing and wearing masks were not followed.”“We are verifying the authenticity of the video and trying to ascertain when and where exactly it was shot. Further action will be taken,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/4-of-crowd-that-raised-anti-muslim-slogans-at-jantar-mantar-identified-101628532496890.html
10-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal to launch ‘faceless’ transport services on Wednesday||The Delhi government will launch on August 11 “faceless transport services” that entails providing services such as issuing learner’s licence and registration certificate online, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Monday.The service will be formally launched by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday. “All services except issuing driving licence and vehicle fitness are now faceless, meaning applicants don’t have to visit transport authority offices for them,” Gahlot said.With this, Delhi will become one of the first states in the country to bring all transport-related services online, allowing people to save time and money spent on visiting motor licensing officers (MLOs), officials said. Maharashtra is also trying a similar model.Kejriwal is likely to launch the services from the IP Estate MLO, officials said, adding trials of online learning tests have begun at the Sarai Kale Khan and Vasant Vihar offices and over 50 people have been provided learning licences so far.In another tweet, Gahlot congratulated a Delhi resident who was given his learner’s licence test online. “Congrats Adi ! You are one of country’’s first to pass this facial recognition enabled E-LL test. Delhiites get true freedom from long queues. With all services available at their homes, Delhi under able leadership of @ArvindKejriwal has set yet another example for the country,” the minister said, responding to the tweet posted by Adi Singh who praised the department for the initiative.Gahlot also held a meeting with motor licensing officers to discuss ongoing preparations for the launch of the faceless services. “Held a meeting with all the MLOs over preparations of the faceless services. All these faceless services will be dedicated to the public by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on August 11,” Gahlot tweeted.The transport department was working on providing online services since February, the official said.The services will include those related to driving licence and registration certificates such as duplicate copies, change in address, international driving permit and transfer of ownership, they said.According to officials, the majority of transactions at the transport department offices are related to driving licences and registration certificates. In 2019, over 1 million transactions were related to driving licences, and nearly 1.3 million were related to registration certificates, records with the state transport department showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-chief-minister-arvind-kejriwal-to-launch-faceless-transport-services-on-wednesday-101628532496216.html
10-08-2021||Delhi||Woman killed by live-in partner, two others in south Delhi||A 22-year-old man was arrested along with his two friends for allegedly killing his 30-year-old live-in partner in a forested area near Rajpur Khurd village in south Delhi’s Maidan Garhi on Sunday.A senior police officer said they cracked the case after they caught the lie of one of the suspects who called the control room and tried to mislead investigators about witnessing a murder “by two unknown persons”, after carrying out the crime.Police said the suspects -- identified as Anuj Kumar, 22, Ramzan Khan, 32, and Naushad, 21 -- allegedly strangled the woman with her dupatta, left her body in the wooded area and fled.One of them reached home, called the police and informed them that he had seen two men strangling a woman to death in the jungle near Rajpur Khurd village, police said.Kumar was in a live-in relationship with the woman, the police said.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said that the three planned the woman’s murder two days ago as she was against Kumar’s relationship with another woman and opposed their plans to get married.DCP Thakur said that police received a call regarding the body of a woman found in a forested area behind Rajpur Khurd village around 6.30pm on Sunday.Initially, the caller stated that he is an alcohol addict who saw “two men strangling a woman with her dupatta” when he was drinking in the jungle.“The caller told us that he was scared and ran away to his house, from where he later called the police,” said the DCP, adding that a murder case was registered and teams were formed to identify and nab the suspects.During the investigation, the police scanned CCTV cameras installed in the neighbourhood and found that the woman had come to the jungle with two men on a bike from the side of Gosala road. The CCTV footage showed the caller, identified as Ramzan Khan, also going to the jungle during the same time.“When confronted with the video footage, Khan broke down and confessed to his involvement in the crime. His interrogation led to the arrest of Anuj Kumar and Naushad and the recovery of the bike used in the crime,” said DCP Thakur.Kumar’s interrogation revealed that he befriended the woman around two years ago and eloped with her.Though they were in a live-in relationship, Kumar was also in a relationship with another woman, who was also pressuring him to marry her.Two days ago, Kumar eloped with the second woman but her family members located them and asked him to leave his live-in partner, the police said.“Kumar shared his problems with Khan and Naushad and the three planned to kill his live-in partner. Kumar and Naushad lured her to the jungle, where Khan was already present. They strangled her to death and left her body there,” added the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/woman-killed-by-live-in-partner-two-others-in-south-delhi-101628532378099.html
10-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt kicks off plans to mark India’s 75th year of independence||The state government on Monday kicked off celebrations to mark the 75th year of India’s Independence with a ceremonial run from the Delhi secretariat to Raj Ghat.Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who participated in the run, said the event was aimed to signify that even though India is turning 75, the hearts and spirits of its people are still young.“On the occasion of the 75th year of Independence, I congratulate everyone as we celebrate our freedom. I hope that we all can together fill our motherland with a spirit of joy, and happiness and keep working for the welfare of each and every person in the country. We will work in order to achieve great heights for our nation,” Sisodia said.The spot run — called for Run For Delhi@75 — was held on a three-kilometre stretch from the Delhi Secretariat to Raj Ghat. About 200 employees and officers of the secretariat participated in the run and were grouped in batches of 10-15 persons, officials said.Chief secretary Vijay Dev said, “Let Delhi make it an example for the nation that we are all here to celebrate, to run for the celebration of our freedom and fitness, which we owe to ourselves, our community and our country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-kicks-off-plans-to-mark-india-s-75th-year-of-independence-101628532377425.html
10-08-2021||Delhi||Deshbhakti curriculum will be taught through activities, no formal exam||A quick question-and-answer session as warm-up, followed by creative activities such as visualisation and self introspection, and opinion collection from outside classrooms to ”broaden one’s perspective” — that’s how the Delhi government will teach the ”deshbhakti curriculum” from this year to all students from nursery to Class 12. The evaluation will be done without the students having to take a formal exams, the education department officials said.The Delhi government plans to launch the curriculum in public schools as soon as schools reopen. On Friday, the government announced that the governing council of the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) has adopted the framework for the curriculum.Ahead of assembly elections in 2020, the Aam Aadmi Party in its manifesto promised to introduce deshbhakti curriculum in all Delhi government schools once elected to power. While presenting the annual budget in March, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia announced that the deshbhakti curriculum will be introduced in the 2021-22 academic session.According to officials of the education department, the curriculum is designed as a “set of activities” that are related to students’ day-to-day life. “The government has shortlisted several activities and the SCERT has adopted them. These activities will now be classified into different categories. Most of the activities are related to the daily lives of students with the purpose to make them more self-aware, self-confident, develop problem-solving approaches and make them socially responsible. That’s how they can contribute the most to the nation,” said a senior official, who asked not to be named.For students enrolled up to class 8, there will be just a single period of deshbharkti curriculum daily, while the education department is yet to finalise the number of periods for those studying in classes 9 to 12, the official said.According to an official document seen by HT, the lessons have been designed in five steps. For instance, the classes will begin with a warm-up question-and-answer session in order to spark student interest and involvement. This will be followed by activities that will aim to “accelerate children’s expression in class and engagement with the content”. “Activities such as visualisation, self-introspection, interpretation and creative exercises will be conducted to help students delve deeper into questions or issues raised in class discussions,” the document read.As homework, the students will be asked to seek views and opinions of people around them — adults and acquaintances in order to “enhance the expanse of discussion and broaden student perspective”. “The final step will be introspection in which children will introspect and share what and how much they have learnt from the chapter. It will help deepen children’s learning and help them better understand their own thoughts and opinions,” the document added.A member of the curriculum committee, who wished not to be named, said the pedagogy of deshbhakti curriculum will be similar to the happiness curriculum and entrepreneurship mindset curriculum launched by the Delhi government in 2018 and 2019, respectively. “Here, the idea is to convert values into actions and to make each child realise that every action of theirs represents their relationship to India and has an impact on the country. This will be done through activities, stories and discussion just like we have been teaching students how to be happy and how to develop entrepreneurship skills,” the member said.At the end of the academic season, the students will be evaluated through self-assessment, peer assessment, and assessment by the teacher. “No formal examinations or grading system will be followed for the Deshbhakti curriculum. Emphasis will be on observing and assessing the development of the values, behaviours and actions of Deshbhakti amongst students on an ongoing basis,” the document added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/deshbhakti-curriculum-will-be-taught-through-activities-no-formal-exam-says-delhi-government-101628532376927.html
10-08-2021||Delhi||Repair work at Old Delhi’s Masjid Mubarak Begum begins||The World Monument Fund has begun work to repair the central dome of the 200-year-old Masjid Mubarak Begum. Located in Old Delhi’s Hauz Qazi Chowk, one of the mosque’s three domes collapsed due to heavy rain in July last year.Repair and reconstruction work on the heritage site was started with the Delhi Waqf Board (DWB) inking an agreement with the World Monument Fund— a non-profit organisation that provides direct financial and technical support for the preservation of heritage sites across the globe—earlier this year.Mehfooz Mohammad, section officer, DWB, said work had been initiated at the mosque recently. “Pits for preparation of lime mortar have been constructed. Due to rain, the work is on hold but once the weather improves, it will be carried out in full swing,” said Mohammad.A senior WMF official said conservation experts were documenting the site, and lime mortar pits have already been built. “The lime needs to be processed. It takes around two-three weeks for this to happen. By the time, documentation and research process is completed, we will be ready to start conservation,” said the official, who did wish to be named.WMF officials have said that the process is expected to take four-five months, provided work is not disrupted on account of Covid-related problems. “We are hoping that sourcing of required material and craftsmen is not disrupted due to Covid-related concerns. The team will make efforts to source original material as per requirements,” said the official.Another member of the conservation team, who did not asked to be named, said the weather conditions have not been helpful but the required material has been arranged. “Most of the material has been sourced from Delhi itself. If we require other things, we will source them, and once lime is processed, we will start work,” said the official.Masjid Mubarak Begum was commissioned in 1822 by Mubarak Begum, the wife of David Ochterlony, the first British Resident of Delhi to the Mughal court. Located in Old Delhi’s Hauz Qazi Chowk, the mosque is built using sandstone and painted in terracotta colour.According to author Swapna Liddle, Mubarak Begum was quite well-respected and enjoyed an important stature in her time. She was also a frequent visitor at the courts of Mughal rulers Bahadur Shah Zafar and Akbar Shah. Due to the influence she exercised, Begum was popularly addressed as ‘Generalee Begum’ since Ochterlony was known as General Ochterlony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/repair-work-at-old-delhi-s-masjid-mubarak-begum-begins-101628532316929.html
10-08-2021||Delhi||Dalit girl’s rape-murder in Delhi: Four accused sent to three-day police custody||A Delhi court on Monday sent four people, accused in the alleged rape and murder of a nine-year-old Dalit girl in south west Delhi’s Delhi cantonment area, to three-day police custody.Additional sessions judge Ashutosh Kumar remanded the four accused—Kuldeep Singh, Laxmi Narayan, Radhey Shyam and Salim Ahmad---to custodial interrogation till August 12.On August 1, a nine-year-old girl was allegedly raped and killed by a priest and three employees of a crematorium in Purani Nangal village, near Delhi Cantonment. The suspects allegedly told the family that she died of electrocution when she was fetching water from an electric water cooler installed at the crematorium. They allegedly cremated her body after threatening her parents not to tell the police about the incident.Police had said the four men were arrested after the girl’s family alleged foul play.The investigating officer in the case informed the court that new facts have emerged during the investigation and further custody of the accused was required for five days.The remand application was opposed by the counsels for the accused who argued that there is no evidence against the accused and neither has the police presented a justified ground for grant of custody.The four men have been booked for murder, rape and criminal intimidation, a case regarding which was registered under Indian Penal Code’s sections 302, 376 and 506, in addition to relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the SC/ST Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dalit-girl-s-rape-murder-in-delhi-four-accused-sent-to-three-day-police-custody-101628532196764.html
10-08-2021||Delhi||Strong rain likely in Delhi after monsoon break: IMD||Even as the monsoon is expected to enter a ‘break phase’ with little rainfall in store for at least a week, after a mostly dry August in Delhi, forecasters said the city is likely to get a stronger spell of rain in the latter half of the month, which may even cover up for the first half.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Delhi is set for a dry spell that may last six days.“Monsoon entering a break phase means that there is no intense system that can result in rainfall. It happens when the monsoon trough moves to another region. From August 10, the trough is likely to move north to the Himalayan foothills. During this period, parts of northwest and central India will mostly be dry till the trough again starts moving towards south. Good rainfall spells may occur once the monsoon recedes, covering for the first half,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.The break may last till around August 15-16, said experts. This is a usual phenomenon that is observed almost every other year. “In the absence of rainfall, the temperatures are likely to rise and may be above the season’s normal,” Srivastava added.He added that though Delhi receives most of its monsoon rain in August, showers in the second half may be able to cover for the entire month. The city usually gets 247mm rain in August.According to IMD, the monsoon season in India lasts from June 1 to September 30.Even though the IMD predicted light rainfall for Monday, none of the weather stations across Delhi received any precipitation between 8.30am and 5.30pm.According to Met officials, the expected break will be the second during the monsoon this year, after the first one in the last week of June this year delayed its arrival into the national capital.The monsoon then arrived in Delhi on July 13, over two weeks behind its usual arrival date.Independent forecasters too said that the monsoon is likely to revive only after August 15. “The break phase usually lasts a week or so, as has been observed over the years. The monsoon may revive in Delhi and all over northwest India by August 17, after which the trough moving back to Delhi may result in good showers,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, Skymet, a private forecaster.He added that when the trough is in the Himalayas, westerly winds start blowing over Delhi. Though humidity levels will reduce slightly with westerly winds, but with already enough moisture in the atmosphere, coupled with high temperatures, it is likely to add to discomfort.According to IMD, the maximum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory, considered representative for Delhi weather was 33.4 degrees Celsius, a notch below the season’s normal. The minimum temperature was recorded 25.1°C, two below normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-as-monsoon-enters-break-phase-experts-say-rain-in-second-half-of-august-may-cover-up-for-the-month-101628532140409.html
10-08-2021||Delhi||Driver’s seat still eludes women in DTC||In April 2015, Venkadarath Saritha became the first woman to be enrolled as a bus driver in the DTC. Till August 9, 2021, she remains the only woman driver in the city’s public bus operator.Around 4:45am, the Sarojini Nagar bus depot run by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) comes alive with a bunch of men entering the premises and heading straight to the “resting room” to change into their uniforms. While some of them are conductors, the others are bus drivers. Ten minutes later, the roaring noise of a Bullet bike entering the depot makes heads turn.Riding the bike is 36-year old Saritha who goes on with her usual drill of parking her two-wheeler, “not looking here and there” and heading straight to the attendance counter to collect her duty slip for the day.Her joining came with a lot of hope that Delhi will have a greater presence of women in the operation of its state-run buses which carry at least 4.2 million passengers every day. But, six years later, Saritha continues to be the only female bus driver Delhi has ever got. To be sure, DTC has women working as bus conductors and marshals. Delhi has 6,750 operational buses which includes 3,760 owned by DTC and 2,990 buses run under the cluster scheme.“Look around, you can see how things are here. It takes a lot of adjusting to fit into this environment. Unlike others, I come wearing the uniform from my home. There is one resting room, which has beds, etc but it is used by the men. After six years of working here, the DTC administration listened to our request, and has now agreed to build a separate resting room for women employees. A defunct room was cleaned and emptied just last month with a bed being placed there, but it remains shut and is still not yet accessible to us,” Saritha said.HT found the room locked during a visit to the depot. One of the many dingy and dark corridors inside the depot leads to the only accessible woman’s washroom. “The staff working in the administration have a different one. But, for me and the other female conductors and bus marshals, it is this single Indian style toilet which is not cleaned frequently. Also, I do not know why, but I have seen men using it too despite having more toilets than us,” she said.“That is why I do not even use it. I use the toilets in Noida Sector 62, Dhaula Kuan or Nauroji Nagar as they are way cleaner and have more lighting. Even if I have the urge to relieve myself, I have to hold on to it until I reach any of these three places which are on my bus route,” Saritha said, while adjusting herself in the drivers’ seat of an AC bus on route 392 --- Mayapuri Chowk to Noida Sector 62.Data accessed by HT showed that of the total 28,949 employees of DTC, as on Monday, 28,149 (97.2%) were male, while 800 (2.7%) were female. Besides just one woman bus driver, DTC has 15,433 conductors of which 14,702 (95.2%) are men and 731 (4.7%) are women.RS Minhas, deputy chief general manager (public relations), DTC said the state transport utility initiated a fresh recruitment process for drivers and conductors in March this year in preparation for the new bus procurement plans. “We tried to recruit woman drivers this time. But, we have found that there are hardly any women who possess a heavy vehicle driving licence that is required to drive a DTC or cluster bus. Moreover, for the post of driver, one must also have a driving experience of three years, which means the licence should be at least three years old. Few women fits this criteria. Overall also, if we see, the number of woman applicants to job of driver are close to nil,” he said.Omkari, 43, who goes by her first name, and her friend were among the select few women who applied to be DTC bus drivers this year. “But, both of us got rejected because our heavy vehicle driving licence was just four months old. I hope they waive off this criteria, and if they are doubtful of our driving skills or fear safety of passengers, they must make us undergo rigorous training for three months and test us after the course,’ she said. Omkari is a faculty at NGO Azad Foundation’s women’s only driving school in Shahdara. Prior to this, she drove commercial taxis for more than five years.Amrita Gupta, director-research advocacy and communications at Azad Foundation, which also trained and helped induct Saritha in 2015, said it recently held a meeting with transport minister Kailash Gahlot who suggested conducting an evidence-based policy review on this matter and get back to the government with its findings.“In 2020, during the pandemic Azad Foundation trained at least 12 drivers who successfully received heavy vehicle licence from the state transport department. However, according to the current rules, the heavy vehicle licence has to be achieved three years in advance for them to apply. We have requested the Delhi government to kindly to set a precedent by waiving off the minimum period required for applying for the position in DTC. Former DTC MD Debashree Mukherjee had done this in 2015, and that is how Saritha got inducted,” said Gupta.A senior DTC official said in order to attract more woman applicants, it even reduced the minimum height criteria from 162 centimetres to 159 centimetres. But, Gupta said even after the reduction, the criteria continues to be restrictive as in India the average height of women is less than 160cm. “This works as a deterrent for their inclusion even if they are trained. Now, buses come with adjustable seats, hence we request a revision of this restrictive height criterion in today’s technologically advanced environment, and urge the Delhi government to help modify this archaic rule. This will also attract many young women to establish their career in the transport system especially at a time when the Delhi government is in the process of procuring at least 3,500 new buses,” said Gupta.But, for Saritha, who regularly has to dispel rumours of her having quit her job, the role of a DTC bus driver has been empowering beyond her imagination. She started in DTC as a driver with a salary of about ₹12,000 per month, and now she earns about ₹24,000 a month.“I have to give credit to the DTC where it is due. They have been considerate towards me and my needs. For everyone else, the duty is spread between night shift and day shift. But, the DTC made an exception for me and I am given only day duty. Secondly, the bus route for drivers is changed every month. But, for me, they have kept the route fixed (route 392),” Saritha said as she headed back to her home in Govindpuri on her olive colour Enfield bike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/drivers-seat-still-eludes-women-in-dtc-101628532137389.html

The girl’s father said that they had threatened to rape her.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that a case was registered under sections 365 (kidnapping), 511 (attempting to commit offence), 506 (criminal intimidation), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 8 and 12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act at the Sector 10 police station. “The probe is underway and we will take action after verifying facts,” he said.Earlier, the police had said that the labourer and his brother-in-law had visited the area for the first time on the day of the murder.The police said that the girl has been staying at the badminton academy for the past 18 months and pursued her education online. She used to go for coaching classes and was returning from a class when she was allegedly abducted.The girl’s father said, “She said that four men had kidnapped her and were taking her to an under-construction building but she escaped and was hiding in a nearby building. They were threatening to rape her if she did not exit the building. They had surrounded her, made dirty gestures and passed lewd comments.”The girls said that she entered a residence in the building and explained her situation to the residents, following which a woman of the household clicked pictures of the four people and asked them to leave and her husband asked them to go away. “However, they continued to stand there and threatened them not to interfere. They kept on shouting, asking me to come out,” she said.After receiving a call, the girl’s father called the academy manager and requested him to go to her aid. “I had already started from my house for the academy. When my daughter, along with the manager, reached the campus, the four of them followed them and again tried to kidnap my daughter, but locals caught hold of them. One of them who was on a motorbike managed to escape,” he said.The police said that the trio was assaulted on the academy premises, following which one of them died. Two arrests were made after a case was registered on the statement of one of the assault victims.The girl’s father said that they are facing life threats and requested police protection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/four-booked-for-trying-to-abduct-rape-16-year-old-badminton-student-week-after-retaliatory-assault-murder-101628530456670.html
10-08-2021||Pune||Low footfall at malls in Pune on first day of reopening||PUNE On the first day of restrictions being eased in Pune, all 10 major malls in Pune and Pimpri- Chinchwad resumed operations on Monday. As per strict Covid protocols, only citizens with both Covid vaccine doses are allowed inside the malls. As most of the public does not have both doses completed yet, several were denied entry. “We are happy that state government has allowed malls to reopen in Pune city, but as there as a gap of four months it will take some time to gain momentum. On the first day, it was a slow start. There are several protocols that need to be followed, of which the most important is to have both Covid vaccine doses completed. Many customers were sent back as most had only completed a first dose. We are hopeful in the coming days we will have more footfall,” said Mukesh Kumar, chairman, Shopping Centres Association of India (SCAI) and CEO of Infiniti Malls. Surjit Singh Rajpurohit, committee member-(SCAI) and COO, Amanora Mall said, “It was a good start but most of the youngsters coming to the mall didn’t have both doses completed. We have written to the district authorities to change this rule and allow people even if they have the first Covid dose. Most of our staffers have only one dose, so there is a shortage of staff too due to the incomplete vaccination.”Major relief was given to traders, shop, mall owners and hoteliers in the city by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Sunday, as all shops are allowed to remain open till 8 pm for six days in the week. Also malls are allowed to be open and hotel timings have been extended to 10 pm. Pawar also warned that if the district positivity rate goes above 7 per cent the relaxations would be rescinded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/low-footfall-at-malls-on-first-day-of-reopening-101628528715948.html
10-08-2021||Pune||Pune rural admin wants private hosps to hand over current vax stock; replacements in Sept||PUNE In a bid to have vaccines available for the susceptible population, the rural administration has appealed to private hospitals in the city, as well as PCMC to exchange their existing vaccine stock for fresh stocks in September. As of now, the rural administration is facing a shortage of vaccines at government centres as supply has dwindled in August as compared to July. Private hospitals across the district, most of which are located in Pune city, have about 0.46 million Covid vaccine doses. The rural administration is now approaching private hospitals, as rural areas are reporting a much higher number of new Covid-19 cases than the city. The RTPCR positivity rate for Pune rural is 6.5 per cent as of Monday.Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO), Zilla Parishad, said, “We are approaching private hospitals, most of which are located in the city to exchange their current vaccine stock with us, for a fresh stock which we plan to have by September, when the stock arrives. As of now Pune rural has more susceptible people and so we would like to vaccinate as many beneficiaries as possible. As of now the RTPCR positivity of Pune rural is 6.5, which is much higher than the state average. We have about 0.207 million people eligible for their second dose, and as per our estimates private hospitals in the district have a stock of 0.46 million doses. Even if we get half the number of those doses then we could complete the second doses of eligible beneficiaries and increase the number of fully vaccinated people in our villages and councils. The vaccines would be distributed as per the population irrespective of the current status of Covid-19 active cases.”A senior immunisation officer speaking anonymously, said, “As of now our demand is much more than the supply and since it is controlled by the central government there is little we can do about it. However, discussions are underway to reduce the quota of private hospitals from the existing 25% to 15%. The final call will be taken by the central government. However, if private hospitals do give us their stock we would be able to expedite the vaccination process much faster.”Prasad also added that private hospitals would benefit as they would get fresh stock from September and avoid the risk of vaccine wastage due to expiry. However, private hospitals do not seem to be excited about the same. Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital said, “As of now we have only 20,000 vaccines available with us and we get around 500-100 beneficiaries daily. So we are not thinking of returning the stock, in fact we are expecting to get a higher demand for a second dose after August 15.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/rural-admin-wants-pvt-hosps-to-hand-over-current-vax-stock-replacements-in-sept-101628526015849.html

On Monday, Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer said that all three patients did not require hospitalisation. All three had mild to moderate symptoms. The state reported a total of 45 cases of the delta- plus variant, of which Pune reported three, while Jalgaon reported 13, and Ratnagiri 11.Dr Awate said, “A total of 45 of 8,000 samples were sent for genome sequencing. This means that less than 1% tested positive for this variant. It is important to keep in mind that it is natural for the virus to undergo mutations and change its genetic make and so citizens must not be afraid of the same. The only thing we know as of now to stay safe is follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and get vaccinated. Of the three confirmed cases reported in Pune, all are discharged. One from Chakan, aged 42, is a male who tested positive for the infection on June 24. He was admitted to a Covid care centre but did not require any hospitalisation. The other two, both from Nira, bordering Baramati, a female aged 48 and a male aged 14, were isolated at home. The Chakan sample was sent to CSIR, Delhi and the other two to NIV, Pune. All the samples were collected on July 17. None of them required oxygen or remdesivir.”Dr Awate also said that the state government is further focusing on genome sequencing and in addition to National Institute of Virology and National Centre for Cell Sciences (NCCS), who have partnered with BJ Medical College for genome sequencing, the state would also start genome sequencing facilities at two more labs in Pune, the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (ISSER) and the National Chemical Laboratory (NCIL). The samples for sequencing are collected over a number of categories depending on symptoms, active cases or deaths, and pre- and post-vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/3-detla-plus-covid-cases-in-pune-did-not-need-hospitalisation-state-surveillance-officer-101628525895764.html
10-08-2021||Lucknow||Small farmers getting top priority in agricultural policies, efforts made to enhance their income: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said that now small farmers were getting the top priority in the country’s agricultural policies.Serious efforts had been made during the last few years to enhance the income of small farmers through various initiatives, he said.He was interacting with farmers after releasing the ninth instalment of ₹19,500 crore to 9.75 crore farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) during a virtual function that UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath also attended here.“Under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, ₹1 lakh 60 crore has been given to farmers so far. Out of this, ₹1 lakh crore was transferred to small farmers during the pandemic period. More than 2 crore Kisan Credit Cards were issued during the corona period, most of them to small farmers,” he said.The PM released ₹4,720 crore to Uttar Pradesh’s 2.25 crore farmers under the scheme. He said that the ₹2,000 instalment that each beneficiary got every four months helped farmers meet their expenses towards seeds, fertilisers etc because of which they were saved from falling prey to moneylenders. The PM also interacted with the beneficiaries of the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund Scheme that was launched a year ago.Shyama Charan Upadhayaya, one of the beneficiaries, told the PM in a virtual interaction that he had formed a farmer producer organisation (FPO) involving 517 farmers in his district (Kasganj) in UP with assistance provided under the new scheme. A BSc degree holder in botany, Upadhyaya grows medicinal and aroma plants on 280 hectares of land helping FPO members get a good income. The PM lauded Upadhyaya’s efforts of setting up a chilling and icing plant in the district.Modi said the scheme of Kisan Infrastructure Fund with a corpus of ₹1 lakh crore completed one year on Monday and urged farmers to avail of the scheme to enhance their income. Referring to the upcoming 75th Independence Day, he said that apart from being an occasion for pride, it was also an opportunity for new resolutions.“We have to take this opportunity to decide where we want to see India in the coming 25 years,” he said. He further said that agriculture and farmers had a big role in determining the condition of India in 2047, when the country would complete 100 years of independence.“It is time to give a direction to India’s agriculture to face new challenges and take advantage of new opportunities,” he remarked. The PM said that the government had made the highest-ever purchase from farmers at MSP (minimum support price), be it the kharif or the rabi season. “With this, about ₹1,70,000 crore has directly reached the accounts of rice farmers and about ₹85,000 crore has gone directly into the accounts of wheat farmers,” he said.He urged farmers to grow pulses and oilseeds more and more to meet the country’s requirement.The PM said that food parks, kisan rails and infrastructure fund would help small farmers.“In the year gone by, more than 6,000 projects have been approved under the Infrastructure Fund. These steps increase the small farmer’s access to the market and his bargaining power through FPOs,” the Prime Minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/small-farmers-getting-top-priority-in-agricultural-policies-says-pm-101628525176334.html
10-08-2021||Lucknow||Young and fearless: They display nerves of steel to rescue snakes in Uttar Pradesh||Quick reflexes, a cool and razor-sharp brain, nerves of steel and a fearless heart — that is what it takes to be a skilful snake rescuer. And 19-year-old Prachi Tiwari has all these traits. No wonder, many foresters say about her: “Don’t go by her delicate, skinny look, she can do things that most of us can’t.”Prachi is perhaps the youngest female snake catcher-cum-rescuer who is part of one of Uttar Pradesh’s oldest snake/reptile-rescuing-helplines operating in Lucknow and the adjoining districts.The foresters’ praise of her skills received further endorsement during a rescue operation at the Lucknow zoo a couple of months ago.On getting a SOS call reporting the presence of a thick python in the zoo’s open area, the 19-year-old was rushed to the spot and took control of the situation. It was found that the snake was a thick Indian rock python, around six feet in length and weighed several kilograms.The zoo staffers were overheard saying: “She is too young to handle the snake.”Undeterred and armed with a hook and bag, she successfully rescued the python.“I was just focusing on the snake. I want to tell people it’s not your body’s constitution but your skills that matter while rescuing a snake,” she said.In her almost a year-long stint as a snake rescuer, she has saved around 12 non-venomous snakes including python, rat snake, checkered keelback (commonly known as Asiatic water snake) and common kukri. Prachi, who aspires to be an IFS (Indian Forest Service) officer, became part of the helpline in June last year only after celebrating her 18th birthday. “Currently, I am allowed to handle only non-venomous snakes. Soon, I would be tackling the venomous ones as well,” she said. Prachi is the sister of Aditya Tiwari, who owns an NGO Paryavarnam that runs the snake rescue helpline. She gives the entire credit to her brother Aditya and her father for bringing her close to nature.She, however, is not the lone female snake rescuer in a special group of 12. In all, about half-a-dozen others are part of it. Devyani Singh, 31, is the senior most among female snake rescuers with expertise in rescuing the venomous snakes.In her almost six-year career, Devyani has rescued more than 80 snakes and other reptiles.Cobra, Common Krait, Russel’s Viper and saw-scaled viper are a few of venomous snakes that she rescued. Admitting that rescuing poisonous snakes is not easy, she recalled a most recent experience.“We got an SOS call from Parag Dairy near Bhaisakund, Lucknow, informing about a snake on a battery-loaded truck. We rushed to the spot and asked the staffers to stay away. On boarding the truck, we came to know that it was a cobra that was hiding between the batteries. While we were trying to bag the snake, a hiss was heard from another corner. To our surprise, we noticed another male cobra that was in the attacking mode. It took me more than half-an-hour to tackle the situation. This rescue operation would be remembered throughout one’s life. There are several such stories to tell,” she said.She said she was thankful to her mother Rooma Chauhan, a retired official of National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI) for motivating her throughout. “I know how tough it is for a mother to allow a daughter to pursue her dream of rescuing snakes. But I am thankful to her as she always motivated me,” she added. She said she would like to continue pursuing a career in the same field and would continue to live up the motto of the Paryavarnam helpline that is to prevent human-animal conflict and to minimise the snake bite cases to zero.Aditya Tiwari, a nature enthusiast from Lucknow, launched the helpline—8090667166 in 2012.Instead of climbing career ladder, he chose to save snakesRescuing snakes, especially venomous ones, is no cakewalk. Aditya Tiwari, a nature enthusiast, knows this all too well. Yet, he remains unfazed by the challenge.A consultant to the “snake house” at Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo), he said he preferred nature conservation to better job opportunities. Hence, he was trying to conserve nature in his own way through the human-animal conflict helpline. Aditya Tiwari runs the NGO Paryavarnam and launched the helpline—8090667166 in 2012.In the nine years since inception, Tiwari and his group have rescued more than 2500 snakes and other reptiles. However, his journey as a conservationist was not easy.Tiwari gave the entire credit of bringing him close to nature to his father, a retired government employee and a staunch believer in Lord Shiva.“I remember the short trips to the temple where my father used to touch the snakes with the snake charmers. He used to ask me to touch them as well. He also used to tell me the names of the snakes and about their habitat,” Aditya recalled.His curiosity about how snakes could move despite not having legs attracted him to the reptiles.Out of curiosity, he said he read all the literature about snakes available on the internet and had watched all the shows related to snakes on wildlife channels to learn about them.Tiwari was in class 9 when he had his first encounter with a live snake at home.“It was a sultry afternoon when my mother shouted.... and my sister came rushing to me, saying that there was a snake in the house. Having watched so many television shows based on snake rescue, I was treating myself to be no less than an international snake expert. I immediately assessed the situation, went into the kitchen, tried to calm down my mother and asked about the colour and location of the snake,” he said.“The seemingly professional behaviour of mine surprised my parents, too, who just stood by to watch what I was about to do next. I took my mother’s kitchen tong and my socks. I took hold of the snake with the help of the tong and guided it into the socks. The job was done. That was no less than a Eureka moment for me but before I could expect a few words of appreciation, the snake escaped from the tiny hole in the socks and I received a thorough scolding from my parents,” he recalled.Recollecting the maiden rescue operation, he said the first call was from Chhata Mill in Bakshi Ka Talab (BKT) area of Lucknow where a snake was sighted in a granary.“We rushed to the site. On enquiring, we concluded that it was a cobra. I remember that I was holding a tong and I have asked another volunteer, who was holding a torch to assist me. I managed to get hold of the snake, using a tong and then we heard a loud hiss, following which the volunteer ran away. It was pitch dark in the granary again and I was left with a cobra in my hand. I at once threw the cobra to one corner and ran out of the granary. Though it was an unsuccessful rescue operation, it taught me a lot,” he said. After gaining experience for seven years, he registered his own NGO Paryavarnam and took the snake conservation work to a new level.Tiwari’s group has 12 members at present and six of the snake rescuers are women.“Yes, that’s true. We have 50% boys and 50% girls on our team. The youngest girl in our team is 19,” he said.Giving a brief idea about the “daredevils”, he said almost all the group members were professionals working together voluntarily out of interest.“We first teach them how to identify snakes or any reptile. This helps the volunteer in learning more about the particular animal which further eases the rescue process.” He said the motto of the group is to prevent human-animal conflict.During the monsoon, the call load increases to 10 to 15 calls a day. On regular days, the group receives around three to six calls a day.“On getting a call, the first thing we ask the caller is to stay away and keep watch. Then we note down the address, ask about the colour and other details of the snake or any reptile and tell them to keep watch. On the other hand, we prepare our team and rush to the spot. Once we reach, we make sure that the area is clear. With the help of hook and gunny bag, we ensure that the snake is rescued safely. Once rescued, we inform the forest department that ensures that the animal is released in the forest area.”Tiwari said more than handling snakes, it was tougher to convince his family members, especially his mother, to let him continue his work.“No doubt, it’s my father who brought me closer to nature but it’s actually tough to convince them to allow me to continue rescuing snakes. However, after so many years, now they are ok. But I know that somewhere within, they don’t want me to expose myself to the dangerous task of rescuing snakes that can cost one life,” he said.Seal AC ducts, plug manholes to keep snakes at baySnakes were the most peace-loving creatures, nature enthusiast Aditya Tiwari said.“They won’t harm you unless you harm them or if the snake thinks that you may harm them. In the monsoon, snakes generally come out in search of rats or frogs. And the chances of a snake entering the house increase if you reside in greener areas, including the Cantonment,” he added. The best way to prevent snakes’ entry into houses was to seal cracks, holes, plug manholes, AC ducts leading into the houses as it often acted as a hideout for snakes, he added.“On seeing a snake, do not panic. Maintain safe distance and inform us,” he said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/young-and-fearless-they-show-nerves-of-steel-to-rescue-snakes-in-uttar-pradesh-101628519956415.html
10-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chamba artisans struggle to keep art of metal craft alive||Tucked away in the snow-clad Himalayas with the Ravi and Chenab rivers meandering through its beautiful landscapes, Chamba, an erstwhile princely state, has a rich heritage of art and craft. Metal casting is one such matchless art form with its origin in the 10th century when King Sahil Verman shifted his capital from Brahmpur (present day Bharmour) to Chamba. Believed to have been introduced by Kashmiri artisans, the metal craft, which showcases relics of Chamba’s past, stares at an uncertain future. Once a source of livelihood for thousands, this unique skill is waning fast with only two families left in the business today. Ankit Verma, whose family has been into metal crafting for centuries, says the intricate art passed down generations requires years of practice. “We usually make idols and Mohra mask of deities, folk musical instruments and vessels. Chamba Thaal, a brass plate used for rituals, which was introduced only 40 years ago, is now representative of Chamba’s metal craft,” says the young artist. “However, there are few takers for this art today and it may soon fade away if steps are not taken to promote it,” he adds. Livelihood gains primacy over art The new generation has shown little interest in picking up metal casting and is exploring other career options for a secure livelihood. “It takes long to master this art and needs big investment. Also, there is lack of knowledge about its value in terms of our cultural legacy,” Verma says. He believes the craft stands a chance if introduced in schools and taught in institutes of fine art to encourage youngsters to take it up as a profession. Moulding idols, crafting legacy Making Chamba metal artefacts involves two techniques: The lost-wax method (cire perdue) and sand casting. Cire perdue involves making a wax model (a sculpture), coating it with a refractory (clay) to form a mould. The wax is heated until it melts and runs out of small holes left in the mould, and then pouring metal into the space left vacant. Each artefact made using the lost-wax technique is unique and a masterpiece. Sand casting is used for mass production. Vijay Sharma, a Padma Shri awardee for Kangra miniature painting and a researcher, says statues in Bharmour and Chamba temples are marvels of Chamba metal craft. The beautiful craft is also seen in the form of metal casting on walls and door frames of temples. “Of late, the art has lost favour due to lack of promotion and a marketing platform,” he says. Glorious past, uncertain future Another artist, Himanshu Anand, says his grandfather won a national award for metal craft in 1973, while his father Rajesh Anand’s works have been showcased in foreign museums, including in the US. “We need an apt platform for our products. Earlier, there was a government procurement centre in Chamba, but it shut shop a few years ago,” he says. “In a technology-run and industrialised era, people are forgetting traditional crafts and moving towards machine-made artefacts that are cheaper. The younger generation of artisans’ families are also giving up the art for want of a secure livelihood,” he says. Amid the gloom, a ray of hope There is still a ray of hope as the Chamba Thaal, the decorative premium brass plate with vibrant images of gods and goddesses, such as the 10 incarnations of Vishnu and nine incarnations of Goddess Durga, is gaining popularity as a keepsake from Chamba. Surender Thakur, who is in-charge of Chamba’s Bhuri Singh Museum, says Union sports minister Anurag Thakur presented the Chamba Thaal as a souvenir to Tokyo Olympic medal winners Mirabai Chanu and PV Sindhu recently. “This will help promote Chamba art at the national and international levels,” he says. The district administration recently constituted the Chamba Art and Craft Promotion Society to prop up Chamba art. Society adviser Manuj Sharma says the Union sports ministry has requisitioned more Chamba Thaal to felicitate the hockey teams and other medal winners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chamba-artisans-struggle-to-keep-art-of-metal-craft-alive-101628515035700.html
10-08-2021||Kolkata||Amit Shah behind attacks on TMC leaders in Tripura: Mamata||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee alleged on Monday that Union home minister Amit Shah orchestrated the weekend attack on 14 Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders in Tripura and their subsequent arrest while they were on a visit to the north-eastern state to prepare for next year’s assembly elections.“Tripura chief minister Biplab Deb does not have much courage. I firmly believe that the instructions came from Amit Shah and the Union home ministry,” Banerjee told reporters after visiting youth TMC leaders Jaya Dutta and Sudip Raha at the state-run SSKM Hospital in Kolkata.The TMC chief alleged that the life of her nephew and party national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, who had rushed to Tripura to monitor the situation on Sunday, was in danger.“Abhishek’s car was attacked last week,” she said, referring to an incident on August 2 wherein Abhishek was shown black flags in Agartala and his vehicle was hit with bamboo sticks by a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker.“Abhishek was saved because the (Tripura) government had provided a bullet-proof car. Had it been an ordinary car, the windshield would have shattered into pieces. He could have suffered a head injury,” the chief minister said while referring to the BJP as a “party of demons”.Abhishek was on a visit to the state after 23 members of political strategist Prashant Kishor’s Indian-Political Action Committee (I-PAC) team were booked and asked to stay inside a hotel in Agartala for violating Covid-19 norms.“Whenever Abhishek boards a plane, five ruffians are placed in the seats around him. His life is in danger. Instructions have been sent to Tripura so that we cannot hire planes and helicopters,” Banerjee said.“Before being arrested, our youth leaders were assaulted in front of the police. The police did not arrange for their treatment or even give them water for 36 hours,” she added.Reacting to the chief minister’s allegations, Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said, “If the chief minister claims that goons are boarding planes to pose a threat to Abhishek Banerjee, her police are free to arrest them at the Kolkata airport. What is stopping them?”“As far as whatever she said about Amit Shah is concerned, we leave it to the judgement of the masses. The BJP has not become so intellectually bankrupt that it has to react to such allegations. The TMC is an insignificant force in Tripura,” Bhattacharya added.On Saturday, TMC youth front leaders Debangshu Bhattacharya, Sudip Raha and Jaya Dutta, who were touring Tripura as part of the party’s plans to prepare for assembly polls in 2023, alleged that their vehicles were stopped and attacked on Ambassa Road by goons backed by the BJP. The TMC leaders also claimed that shots were fired and a party office was vandalised in Dharmanagar, the biggest Tripura town after Agartala.On Sunday morning, the three leaders, along with 11 others, were arrested for violating Covid-19 restrictions by travelling after 7pm. Tripura has been observing a night curfew for 10 hours starting from 7pm in the wake of the pandemic. All the TMC leaders were charged under non-bailable sections of the Indian Penal Code but were granted bail by a local court later in the day.Following this, Abhishek rushed to Tripura along with Bengal minister Bratya Basu, Rajya Sabha member Dola Sen and TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh and returned with the injured youth leaders on Sunday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/amit-shah-behind-attack-on-tmc-leaders-in-tripura-alleges-mamata-banerjee-101628506155259.html
10-08-2021||World||UN envoy warns of Myanmar civil war if no successful talks||The UN special envoy for Myanmar warned Tuesday of “a full-scale civil war” if the powerful military, supporters of the ousted democracy, ethnic groups and other key parties don’t hold a successful dialogue on all issues ranging from the current Covid-19 outbreak to the root causes of the country’s crisis.Christine Schraner Burgener told a news conference that clashes between the military and local defense forces are continuing, people are frightened and suffering, there is no freedom of speech, the World Bank predicts an 18% drop in GDP this year and the International Labor Organization estimates 2.2 million jobs have been lost since January.On top of that, she said, Myanmar is currently facing “a severe Covid-19 third wave” with more than 333,000 reported cases, including 3,611 new cases on Monday.Myanmar for five decades had languished under strict military rule that led to international isolation and sanctions. As the generals loosened their grip, culminating in Aung San Suu Kyi’s rise to leadership in 2015 elections, the international community responded by lifting most sanctions and pouring investment into the country. The Feb. 1 coup followed November elections, which Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party won overwhelmingly and the military contests as fraudulent.Schraner Burgener said Myanmar’s military leader, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, wants to maintain his grip on power, pointing to the recent declaration naming him prime minister, the annulment of November’s election and fears that Suu Kyi’s party will soon be disbanded.In her wide-ranging discussions with all sides in Myanmar, she said she realized no sides “will give up and are ready to make any compromises.”So she said she decided not to wait for the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations known as ASEAN to appoint a special envoy and moved ahead with her proposal for an all-inclusive dialogue that would also include discussions of humanitarian assistance, the plight of Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslim minority and “root causes” — the country’s federal system, constitution, army, election and legal systems, and more.Over the last two months, Schraner Burgener said, she discussed her proposal with key parties in Myanmar and the international community.Her proposal also envisions an international observer group including China, India, Japan, Thailand, United States, United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland, European Union, United Nations and ASEAN, which includes Myanmar.During her discussions, she said Myanmar’s ethnic armed organizations “were in the majority very positive of this idea” and members of the National United Government, established by elected legislators who were barred from taking their seats when the military seized power on Feb. 1, were “interested in the ideal but clearly would have preconditions to start such a dialogue.”Schraner Burgener said she had a long conversation with deputy military chief Soe Win on July 16 on many issues including the proposal for a dialogue, but “I didn’t receive an answer,” and since then, “There is no positive feedback from the army on this dialogue, which I really regret.”Nonetheless, she said, a dialogue will hopefully start through ASEAN and its new special envoy for Myanmar, Brunei’s Second Foreign Minister Erywan Yusof. She said she had a long videoconference Monday with Yusof, who plans to visit Myanmar after consulting key parties, and told him, “He can count on my full support.”“I also offered to join him, so I hope that the army will be ready also to receive me,” she said, adding that she believes the military keeps saying it’s not ready to meet her not because they don’t want to talk to her but “because people on the ground would be very encouraged by my presence in the country, and that’s probably something which the army doesn’t want to see.”Schraner Burgener said she remains worried that the country will move in the direction of a civil war if the dialogue, which hopefully will start through ASEAN, “will not be successfully done.”“We see a lot of violence on the ground,” she said.Many people are afraid of “the huge violence scale” of the military, she said, but “the people’s defense forces” have also moved from using self-made weapons and “are using now professional weapons.”“So, I really hope that a dialogue can happen to avoid a breakout of a full-scale civil war,” Schraner Burgener said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-envoy-warns-of-myanmar-civil-war-if-no-successful-talks-101628618596465.html
10-08-2021||World||Germany to end free Covid-19 tests for citizens in October||Germany is ending free coronavirus tests for its citizens from October, in part to encourage people to get vaccinated, government officials said Tuesday.Chancellor Angela Merkel said the country had sufficient vaccines for its population - more than half is already fully immunized — and that studies showed they are effective in preventing severe cases of Covid-19, including ones caused by highly contagious virus variants.“The not-so-good news is that the speed of vaccination has declined significantly,” Merkel said after a Tuesday meeting with the country’s 16 state governors.While federal and state officials agreed that people who are fully vaccinated, have recovered from Covid-19 or have recently tested negative should continue to be treated equally in most situations, they also decided that German citizens will have to start paying for their own tests starting Oct. 11.Some German politicians had criticized the proposal, arguing that it amounts to a tax on the poor. Others claimed that ending free testing is a way of punishing individuals who refuse to get vaccinated.After a sluggish start and only really gaining from March onward, Germany's vaccination campaign has lost speed in recent weeks. Officials worry the country may not reach the target set by the federal disease control agency of immunizing at least 85% of people between ages 12 and 59 and 90% of those over 60.In response to the drop in demand, officials have begun pushing for more vaccinations at megastores and in city centers, or offering incentives to get people to show up to get shots.Bavaria's state governor, Markus Soeder, said it would not be fair to those who are vaccinated if they have to keep paying for others' free tests.Soeder added that in his opinion, vaccinated individuals should not be subject to another lockdown if the infection rate rises in the fall.While Germany has a relatively low number of confirmed virus cases compared to other European countries, cases are rising again. Authorities fear unvaccinated Germans, especially young people, may contract and spread the virus in the coming weeks and months.On Monday, the country's disease control agency registered 2,480 new cases, about 700 more than a week earlier. Some 45.6 million people in Germany, or almost 55% of the population, are fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-to-end-free-covid-19-tests-for-citizens-in-october-101628617090444.html
10-08-2021||World||New York governor Cuomo resigns as allegations of sexual harassment snowball||New York state’s Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Tuesday that he was resigning after days of defying growing calls for him to step aside over allegations of sexual harassment by 11 women, including current and former government employees.“New York tough means New York loving. And I love New York. And I love you. And everything I have ever done has been motivated by that love,” Cuomo said, adding that the best way for him to serve New York state was to step aside. His resignation will be effective 14 days from now.Kathy Hochul, a 62-year-old Democrat and former member of the US Congress, will take over from Cuomo and become the state’s first woman governor.Cuomo, a three-term governor, had gained celebrity status for his leadership and handling of the Covid-19 pandemic in New York state, which had been hit the hardest, especially when compared to then US president Donald Trump.Last week, an independent investigation ordered by the New York state’s attorney general Letitia James found that the governor had sexually harassed the 11 women between 2013 and 2020. Brittany Commisso, who was identified in the attorney general’s report as executive assistant No. 1 but has since come forward publicly, said Cuomo had once sexually abused her. She has publicly spoken about the episode in interviews.Also, a state trooper assigned to Cuomo’s security detail had said the governor had once sexually misbehaved with her when they were in a lift.The outgoing New York governor and his personal lawyer have disputed Commisso’s allegations, which she has reported to the police. Cuomo has said that in the other charges he’s facing, he did not mean to touch the women inappropriately and that he was sorry if they felt offended.“I take full responsibility for my actions. I have been too familiar with people,” Cuomo said in televised remarks. “In my mind, I’ve never crossed the line with anyone,” he said, adding that he did not realise the degree to which the “line has been redrawn”.Cuomo said his instinct was to fight, but because the allegations were mostly political and would drag on to distract the government from functioning normally, he was stepping down.He said, “I would never want to be unhelpful in any way, and I think that given the circumstances, the best way I can help now is if I step aside and let the government get back to government, and therefore that’s what I’ll do.”The New York state assembly had launched an impeachment inquiry against him amid mounting calls for his resignation, including from US President Joe Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-governor-cuomo-resigns-as-allegations-of-sexual-harassment-snowball-101628616682686.html
10-08-2021||World||UK reports biggest daily Covid-19 deaths since March even as 75% adults fully vaccinated||The United Kingdom on Tuesday reported the highest single-day deaths related to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) since March. According to the official data, 146 people across the UK, who had tested positive for Covid-19 within 28 days, have died in the last 24 hours, taking the country’s overall death toll to 130,503.In the past seven days, the number of deaths within 28 days of people testing positive for Covid-19 has risen by 14.8%. The rise in fatalities could worry the authorities as they are counting on the high rate of vaccination coverage to reduce hospitalisations and deaths.Over 75% of Britain’s adult population has already been fully vaccinated against the virus but the spread of the Delta variant, which now accounts for more than 99% of Covid-19 cases across the UK, has caused renewed concerns. Early findings by Public Health England (PHE) suggest that fully vaccinated people may transmit the Delta variant as easily as those who are unvaccinated."Some initial findings ... indicate that levels of virus in those who become infected with Delta having already been vaccinated may be similar to levels found in unvaccinated people," PHE stated.With 23,510 new Covid-19 cases reported on Tuesday, the number of daily infections has been witnessing a decline. The cumulative cases for the last seven days, however, is up by 7.4% from the previous week. The UK has administered a total of 86,780,455 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, with 39,688,566 people receiving both doses, according to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).“This is a huge national achievement, which we should all be proud of. It’s so important that those who haven’t been vaccinated come forward as soon as possible to book their jab - to protect themselves, protect their loved ones and allow us all to enjoy our freedoms safely,” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-reports-biggest-daily-covid-19-deaths-since-march-even-as-75-adults-fully-vaccinated-101628615597218.html
10-08-2021||World||New York Governor Andrew Cuomo resigns after sexual harassment findings||New York Governor Andrew Cuomo resigned on Tuesday following an inquiry that found he sexually harassed 11 women, mounting legal pressure and demands for his departure by President Joe Biden and others, a startling downfall for a man once seen as a possible U.S. presidential contender.Cuomo, a Democrat who had served since 2011 as governor of the fourth most-populous U.S. state, made the announcement after New York Attorney General Letitia James on Aug. 3 released the results of a five-month independent investigation that concluded he had engaged in conduct that violated U.S. and state laws.The investigation, detailed in a 168-page report, found that Cuomo groped, kissed or made suggestive comments to women including current and former government workers - one a state trooper - and retaliated against at least one woman who accused him of sexual misconduct. Cuomo denied wrongdoing.Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat from western New York, will take over as governor of the state of more than 19 million people until the end of Cuomo's term in December 2022 as outlined in the state's constitution, becoming the first woman to hold the post.Cuomo's resignation marks the second time in 13 years that a New York governor has stepped down in scandal, after Eliot Spitzer quit in 2008 over his patronage of prostitutes. Cuomo also became the latest powerful man taken down in recent years following the rise of the #MeToo social movement against sexual abuse and harassment that has shaken politics, Hollywood, the business world and the workplace.His resignation spared Cuomo from possible removal from office through impeachment proceedings in the state legislature. An ongoing impeachment investigation had only promised to intensify.Cuomo, 63, was elected to three terms as governor, as was his late father, Mario Cuomo. He previously served as U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development secretary from 1997 to 2001 under former President Bill Clinton.Like his father, Andrew Cuomo never ran for president despite speculation about his possible national ambitions. He gained national prominence last year early in the COVID-19 pandemic after delivering daily news conferences as his state became the U.S. epicenter of the public health crisis.The civil investigation found that the actions of Cuomo and his senior advisers violated multiple state and federal laws, but James did not pursue criminal charges. Local prosecutors are free to do so, meaning Cuomo still could face legal jeopardy.Local prosecutors in Manhattan, Nassau County, Albany County and Westchester County said after the report's release that they are looking into the matter and have requested evidence from the independent inquiry. New York City's mayor said Cuomo should face criminal charges.Cuomo had for months denied mounting allegations of sexual harassment - and renewed those denials after the investigative report was issued. But what was left of his political support crumbled after the findings were made public. Hours later, Biden - a friend of the governor for years - told reporters at the White House: "I think he should resign."Other prominent Democrats including the state's two U.S. senators, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, and U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi also lined up in calling on the party's one-time star to resign.Investigators concluded that Cuomo and his aides created a "toxic" and "hostile" workplace in an office gripped by bullying, fear and intimidation. The complaints about sexual harassment emerged after broader criticism by Democratic politicians in New York that Cuomo governed through intimidation.Cuomo last year appeared to be a politician in ascent, presenting himself as an authoritative figure in televised news conferences on the pandemic. His image was burnished by television interviews with his younger brother, CNN host Chris Cuomo.Shortly after James, a fellow Democrat, detailed the findings, Cuomo, the divorced father of three adult daughters, issued a video statement in which he said, "I never touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate sexual advances.""That is just not who I am," Cuomo said in the video, as he argued that what women described as sexual advances were inoffensive gestures and comments inspired by a natural physical warmth arising from the culture in which he was raised. In the video, he indicated he had no plans to resign, mentioning specifically the fight against the pandemic.A Marist Poll released a day after the report was issued showed that 59% of New Yorkers wanted Cuomo to resign, compared to 32% who said he should serve out his term and 9% who were unsure. Among Democrats, however, only 52% favored resignation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-governor-andrew-cuomo-resigns-after-sexual-harassment-findings-101628611934842.html
10-08-2021||World||US Senate passes Biden's $1 trillion infrastructure bill||A $1 trillion infrastructure package that is a top priority for U.S. President Joe Biden secured enough votes to pass in the Senate on Tuesday, a bipartisan victory for the White House as it aims to provide the nation's biggest investment in decades in roads, bridges, airports and waterways.Voting was continuing in the 100-seat chamber after the measure secured the 50 votes needed for passage.Polls show that the drive to upgrade America's infrastructure, hammered out by a bipartisan group of senators over months of negotiations, is broadly popular with the public.The bill still has to go to the House of Representatives and the spirit of cooperation in Congress that led to its passage on Tuesday will likely prove fleeting.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer aims to follow the bill with a budget resolution laying the groundwork for $3.5 trillion to be spent on healthcare, climate change and other Biden priorities that Democrats will almost certainly have to pass over Republican objections in a maneuver known as "budget reconciliation."Once the resolution is adopted, Democrats will begin crafting the reconciliation package for a vote on passage after they return from their summer break in September.Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said repeatedly that her chamber will not take up either bill until she has both in hand, meaning that months of work remain before Tuesday's measure would go to Biden's desk to be signed into law.The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office on Thursday said the infrastructure bill would increase federal budget deficits by $256 billion over 10 years -- an assessment rejected by negotiators who said the CBO was undercounting how much revenue it would generate.After working for two consecutive weekends on the infrastructure bill, an around-the-clock "vote-a-rama" session could be in store for the Senate starting Tuesday afternoon as it kicks off debate on the larger budget plan.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled that Republicans would try to use the voting sessions to pick off support from moderate Democrats for what he called a "radical" spending package that would create a permanent welfare state and usher in the largest peacetime tax hike in U.S. history."Every single senator will be going on record over and over and over," McConnell added. "We will debate, and we will vote, and we will stand up, and we will be counted, and the people of this country will know exactly which senators fought for them."The budget plan would provide various Senate committees with top-line spending levels for a wide range of federal initiatives, including helping the elderly get home healthcare and more families afford early childhood education.It also would provide tuition-free community college and foster major investments in programs to significantly reduce carbon emissions blamed for climate change.Later, Senate committees would have to fill in the details for scores of federal programs.The budget blueprint was formally unveiled on Monday, the same day a U.N. climate panel warned that global warming was reaching emergency levels, or what U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described as a "code red for humanity."Senate passage of the infrastructure bill and the budget plan would clear the way for it to begin a month-long summer break.When Congress returns in September, it will not only debate the large investment measures but have to fund government activities for the fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1, increase Washington's borrowing authority and possibly try to pass a voting reform bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-passes-biden-s-1-trillion-infrastructure-bill-101628610326797.html
10-08-2021||World||Moderna to start local production of Covid-19 mRNA vaccine in Canada||Moderna Inc said on Tuesday it had agreed with the Canadian government to start domestic production of mRNA vaccines as the country looks to boost supplies to fight respiratory viruses, including Covid-19 and seasonal influenza.Under the memorandum of understanding, Moderna will set up an mRNA vaccine manufacturing facility in Canada and also give access to its mRNA development engine.The Covid-19 vaccine from Moderna, based on mRNA technology, is already being used in the United States, the European Union, and Canada.Scientists believe mRNA has the potential to target diseases that cannot be reached by conventional drugs. Such vaccines, which have shown high efficacy in preventing Covid-19 disease, contain no actual virus, instead providing instructions for human cells to make proteins that mimic part of the coronavirus.Last week, Moderna said its Covid-19 shot was about 93% effective through six months after the second dose, showing hardly any change from the 94% efficacy reported in its original clinical trial.Canada has reported 1.4 million infections and 26,678 coronavirus-related deaths since the pandemic began, according to Reuters tally.The manufacturing facility is expected to be activated on an urgent basis to support Canada with direct access to rapid pandemic response capabilities, Moderna said on Tuesday, adding that it is in talks with other governments about potential collaborations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-to-start-local-production-of-covid-19-mrna-vaccine-in-canada-101628605377763.html
10-08-2021||World||US vows to isolate Taliban if they take power by force||A U.S. peace envoy brought a warning to the Taliban on Tuesday that any government that comes to power through force in Afghanistan won’t be recognized internationally after a series of cities fell to the insurgent group in stunningly quick succession.Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. envoy, traveled to Doha, Qatar, where the Taliban maintain a political office, to tell the group that there was no point in pursuing victory on the battlefield because a military takeover of Kabul would guarantee they will be global pariahs. He and others hope to persuade Taliban leaders to return to peace talks with the Afghan government as American and NATO forces finish their pullout from the country.The insurgents have captured five out of 34 provincial capitals in the country in less than a week. They are now battling the Western-backed government for control of several others, including Lashkar Gah in Helmand, and Kandahar and Farah in provinces of the same names.After a 20-year Western military mission and billions of dollars spent training and shoring up Afghan forces, many are at odds to explain why the regular forces have collapsed, fleeing the battle sometimes by the hundreds. The fighting has fallen largely to small groups of elite forces and the Afghan air force.The success of the Taliban blitz has added urgency to the need to restart the long-stalled talks that could end the fighting and move Afghanistan toward an inclusive interim administration.The new pressure from Khalilzad follows condemnations from the international community and a similar warning from the United Nations that a Taliban government that takes power by force would not be recognized. The insurgents have so far refused to return to the negotiating table.Khalilzad's mission in Qatar is to “help formulate a joint international response to the rapidly deteriorating situation in Afghanistan,” according to the U.S. State Department.He plans to “press the Taliban to stop their military offensive and to negotiate a political settlement, which is the only path to stability and development in Afghanistan,” the State Department said.Meanwhile, the Taliban military chief released an audio message to his fighters on Tuesday, ordering them not to harm Afghan forces and government officials in territories they conquer. The recording was shared on Twitter by the Taliban spokesman in Doha, Mohammad Naim.In the nearly five-minute audio, Mohammad Yaqoob, the son of late Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar, also told the insurgents to stay out of abandoned homes of government and security officials who have fled, leave marketplaces open and protect places of business, including banks.It was not immediately clear if Taliban fighters on the ground would heed Yaqoob's instructions. There have been reports by civilians who have fled Taliban advances of heavy-handed treatment by the insurgents — schools being burned down and repressive restrictions on women.There have also been reports of revenge killings in areas where the Taliban have gained control, and the insurgents have claimed responsibility for killing a comedian in southern Kandahar, assassinating the government's media chief Kabul and a bombing that targeted acting Defense Minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi, killing eight and wounding more. The minister was not harmed in the attack.The intensifying war has also increased the number of civilian casualties.The International Committee of the Red Cross said that its staff has treated more than 4,000 Afghans this month in their 15 facilities across the country, including in Helmand and Kandahar, where Afghan and U.S. airstrikes are trying to rein in the Taliban onslaught.“We are seeing homes destroyed, medical staff and patients put at tremendous risk, and hospitals, electricity and water infrastructure damaged,” Eloi Fillion, ICRC’s head of delegation in Afghanistan, said in a statement.“The use of explosive weaponry in cities is having an indiscriminate impact on the population," Fillion added. “Many families have no option but to flee in search of a safer place. This must stop.”The surge in Taliban attacks began in April, when the U.S. and NATO announced they would end their military presence and bring the last of their troops home. The final date of the withdrawal is Aug. 31, but the U.S. Central Command has said the pullout is already 95% complete.On Monday, the U.S. emphasized that the Biden administration now sees the fight as one for Afghan political and military leaders to win or lose — and showed no sign of stepping up airstrikes despite the accelerating Taliban gains.“When we look back, it’s going to come down to leadership and what leadership was demonstrated, or not” by Afghans, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said at a Pentagon news conference. “It’s their country to defend now. It’s their struggle.”Khalilzad, the architect of the peace deal the Trump administration brokered with the Taliban, was expected to hold talks with key regional players, as well as unspecified multilateral organizations to see how to restart talks and halt the Taliban onslaught.The U.S. envoy will also likely seek a commitment from Afghanistan’s neighbors and the region not to recognize a Taliban government that comes to power by force. When the Taliban last ruled Afghanistan, three countries recognized their rule: Pakistan, Saudi Arabi and the United Arab Emirates.Senior Afghan officials have also travelled to Doha, including Abdullah Abdullah, who heads the government's reconciliation council. Pakistan's national security adviser, Moeed Yusuf, on Monday called for “reinvigorated” efforts to get all sides in the conflict back to talks, describing a protracted war in Afghanistan as a “nightmare scenario” for Pakistan.Yusuf, speaking to foreign journalists in Islamabad, refused to definitively say whether Pakistan, which holds considerable sway over the Taliban, would recognize a Taliban government installed by force, saying instead that Pakistan wants to see an "inclusive" government in Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-vows-to-isolate-taliban-if-they-take-power-by-force-101628596184801.html
10-08-2021||World||China punishes dozens of officials over Delta variant outbreak||China has punished dozens of officials for failing to control the highly contagious Delta variant of coronavirus, according to a CNN report, as the country is witnessing its most serious virus outbreak in months. The current Covid-19 outbreak in China has sparked local lockdowns, mass testing and travel restrictions after an original Delta cluster was detected in Nanjing city.At least 47 Chinese officials have been punished for negligence over the Delta outbreak which has now spread to 31 provinces, reported CNN citing official statements and state media. The officials facing punishments reportedly include the head of local governments, health commissions, and staff at hospitals and airports.In Nanjing alone, 15 officials have been held accountable for allowing Covid-19 transmission at the city’s Lukou International Airport which was busy handling hundreds of summer tourists, according to the Community Party’s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI). Lukou International Airport is believed to be the place where the Delta outbreak started after nine cleaners tested positive for Covid-19.The officials held accountable for ineffective epidemic prevention at Nanjing Lukou International Airport include the city’s deputy mayor and secretary and director of the Nanjing Municipal Health Commission. The city of Yangzhou has also become a Covid hotspot after a cluster of 34 new Covid-19 cases were reported on Tuesday.China was largely successful in containing the virus outbreak within its borders during the early days of the pandemic but the Delta outbreak has threatened the gains. On Tuesday, Chinese health authorities reported 143 new Covid-19 cases, of which 108 were locally transmitted. The latest daily infections are the highest since January when China reported 144 new cases and 126 domestic infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-punishes-dozens-of-officials-over-delta-variant-outbreak-101628604839884.html

10-08-2021||World||Afghan residents stay off streets, hide in homes as Taliban march towards Mazar-e-Sharif||Residents of northern Afghanistan hid in their homes as Taliban fighters were strengthening their march towards the region’s biggest city Mazar-e-Sharif, news agency Reuters reported on Tuesday. The Islamic extremist group captured Aibak, capital of Samangan province, on Monday after meeting with minimal resistance. With this, as many as six provincial capitals have been captured by the group, government officials and Taliban fighters themselves have confirmed.In the wake of the US taking back their troops from the country after two decades, President Ashraf Ghani called on regional strongmen to support his government.Taliban fighters were tightening their capture in Aibak on the main road between Mazar-e-Sharif and the national capital, Kabul, by moving into government buildings, Reuters reported citing residents.The civilians further said that a majority of the government security force members appeared to have withdrawn before the rapidly marching Taliban.Talking about living conditions in Aibak, Sher Mohamed Abbas, a provincial tax officer, said that the only way is “self-imposed house arrest or to find a way to leave for Kabul.”The father of four children, however, told Reuters that Kabul is also “not safe anymore.”Abbas further stated that Taliban fighters had come to his office, and told workers to go home.

10-08-2021||World||China demands Lithuania recall its envoy to Beijing over Taiwan controversy||China on Tuesday said it has demanded that Lithuania recall its Beijing envoy and announced it was withdrawing its own ambassador from the Baltic country following a row over Vilnius allowing China-claimed Taiwan to open a diplomatic office in the country.China claims self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory and expresses displeasure if countries around the world establish official ties with the island.Taiwan announced the new mission in Lithuania last month, with its foreign ministry saying it would be called the Taiwanese Representative Office in Lithuania.It would be the first time the island’s name has been used for one of its offices in Europe.The de facto Taiwanese embassy in New Delhi, for example, is called the Taipei Economic and Cultural Centre in India.Only 15 countries have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.In a strongly-worded statement on Lithuania’s decision, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Tuesday that Vilnius has violated the “one-China” policy. Lithuania’s allowing the office to open under the name of Taiwan was done so “in disregard of China’s repeated representations and articulation of potential consequences”, and severely undermines China’s sovereignty, the ministry said. “The Chinese government expresses its categorical opposition to this move. China has decided to recall its ambassador to Lithuania and demanded the Lithuanian government recall its ambassador to China,” the statement added.As a result, Beijing will recall ambassador Shen Zhifei, while the European nation would have to withdraw its ambassador to China, Diana Mickeviciene.“The Chinese side warns the Lithuanian side that there is only one China in the world and the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China,” the statement said. “We urge the Lithuanian side to immediately rectify its wrong decision, take concrete measures to undo the damage, and not to move further down the wrong path.”The foreign ministry also warned Taiwan about furthering “Taiwan independence” through diplomacy. “We also warn the Taiwan authorities that ‘Taiwan independence’ is a dead end and any attempt at separatist activities in the international arena is doomed to fail.”Lithuania said earlier this year it planned to open its own representative office in Taiwan, and has donated 20,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses to the island, Reuters reported.Last week, China “expressed firm opposition” to the US state department’s approval of an arms sale to Taiwan, and lodged “solemn representations” with Washington following the Joe Biden administration’s decision to sell arms to Taiwan.China will take legitimate and necessary counter-measures in light of the development of the situation, the Chinese foreign ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-demands-lithuania-recall-its-envoy-to-beijing-over-taiwan-controversy-101628597541329.html

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said that Austin and Bajwa also discussed regional security issues and the bilateral defence ties along with the current situation in Afghanistan. Austin said that the US is interested in improving the US-Pakistan relationship.“Secretary Austin and General Bajwa discussed the ongoing situation in Afghanistan, regional security and stability, and the bilateral defence relationship more broadly,” Kirby was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. He said the US does not feel ‘bashful’ to discuss the safe havens along the border with Pakistan’s leadership.“We are also mindful that Pakistan and the Pakistani people also fall victim to terrorist activities that emanate from that region. So, we all have a shared sense of the importance of closing down those safe havens and not allowing them to be used by the Taliban or other terrorist networks to sow discord,” Kirby further added. He said that the US continues to continually raise issues related to the safe havens with the Pakistan leadership.Afghanistan continues to allege that Islamabad is aiding Taliban terrorists and is also sending thousands of terrorists to the country to destabilise the government. Pakistan continues to deny any such role while highlighting that it is due to Islamabad’s efforts Taliban has sat down with the US and Afghanistan to talk peace and stability.The US, however, has not made any changes to its troop withdrawal plans which has provided a fillip to the Taliban which is advancing at a fast pace and has captured several major cities and provinces in the conflict-ridden nation. Despite being on the peace committee, where the US and the Afghanistan government are stakeholders, the terrorist group has used violence to stamp its authority and take control of vast regions of Afghanistan. The US and Nato will withdraw all their troops by August 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-asks-pakistan-to-eliminate-taliban-safe-havens-along-afghan-pak-border-101628594963337.html

Top 10 nations with most cases||The rapid spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant of coronavirus has been driving the surge in infections worldwide, with India and the United States being the major contributors. Over four million coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases were reported from July 26 to August 1, which was largely attributed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to a substantial increase in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Western Pacific Regions. But the number of fatalities related to the virus witnessed an 8% decline as compared to the previous week.The highest number of new Covid-19 cases in that week was reported from the United States, followed by India, Indonesia, Brazil, and Iran. According to a Bloomberg report, the US reported 761,216 new infections in the week ended Sunday, the highest total since early February.Among these five nations, Iran has been witnessing a continued surge, with the Islamic Republic recording nearly 41,000 fresh infections on Monday. The cumulative number of Covid-19 cases reported globally exceeded the sombre milestone of 200 million last week.The sustained increase in global Covid-19 cases is driven by the Delta variant first identified in India which has now been reported from 135 countries, as per the UN health agency’s last epidemiological report. While the Alpha variant of coronavirus, first identified in England, has spread to 182 countries, the Delta variant has caused more concerns to authorities given its high transmissibility.Also Read | Hospitals overwhelmed again as US reports fresh surge in daily casesUK scientists have already warned that the people vaccinated against Covid-19 may transmit the Delta strain as easily as unvaccinated.

The fact came to light after the Imran Khan government presented data in this regard in the National Assembly, news agency ANI reported.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government presented the data on response to a question asked by the opposition, according to ANI. Shibli Faraz, Pakistan's federal minister for science and technology, said in the House that more than 50 per cent of water obtained from various sources in 20 of the 29 cities of Pakistan was found to be unsafe, ANI.The water quality was tested by the Pakistan Council of Research of Water Resources (PCRWR), said the minister. The water quality in at least three cities - Mirpurkhas and Shaheed Benazirabad in Sindh and Gilgit - was found to be 100 per cent unsafe for drinking, the PCRWR said, according to Dawn.Only Sialkot and Gujarat had sources where water was found to be 100 per cent for drinking, Dawn further reported.Pakistan's water availability has already fallen by 400 per cent since its independence, according to Parliamentary Secretary National Health Services Dr Nausheen Hamid. He said in a report in July that per capita water availability declined from 5,600 cubic metres in 1947 to around 1,038 cubic metres in 2021.Noting that Pakistan was the fifth most populous country in the world, she had said water scarcity was a "very serious threat" that will aggravate by 2025. The parliamentary secretary further highlighted that inadequate supply of water aggravated food security in the country.Geo News recently carried a report on Pakistan's water scarcity, in which experts warned that a famine-like situation may arise in the country. The report also said that rivers have dried up due to low rainfall.In the month of March, a Washington-based magazine, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) placed Pakistan at the third position in the list of countries facing acute water scarcity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/20-cities-in-pakistan-lack-safe-drinking-water-imran-khan-govt-reveals-in-data-101628580475145.html

According to a report by Bloomberg, the new cases in the US rose to 761,216 in the week ended Sunday, the highest total since early February.The fresh surge has been fuelled by the Delta mutation of the coronavirus and most of the positive samples have been found of the unvaccinated people.The death toll has also risen to record levels as it climbed 49% to 3,486 for the same period. It was the biggest weekly increase since December, Bloomberg reported.The US is at the top of the list of the countries worst affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Since the onset of the pandemic, the cases have grown exponentially in the country along with fatalities. The trajectory slowed down after the shift in vaccination drive following the appointment of Joe Biden as the President, making it more organised, expanding the distribution to maximum age groups.So far, more than 616,800 Americans have succumbed to the viral infection that targets the immunity system of the body. The number of total infections stands at 35,948,131, the John Hopkins' tally showed.Following the surge, Oregon along with other states reimplemented face mask norms. Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Monday said that he will not repeal his emergency order banning local governments from requiring mask use and social distancing. People are able to make their own decisions on protecting their health, he also said.Mississippi’s top public health official on Monday said that as Covid-19 cases continue to surge with the highly contagious delta variant, no intensive care beds are available in 35 of the state’s top-level hospitals.

10-08-2021||World||Guinea confirms first case of Marburg disease: All you need to know||Officials in Guinea, in western Africa, have confirmed a case of the Marburg disease, news agency AFP has reported quoting the World Health Organization (WHO). This makes it the first recorded case of the deadly Ebola-related disease in the region.The development comes just two months after the WHO announced the end of the country’s second outbreak of Ebola. “The potential for the Marburg virus to spread far and wide means we need to stop it in its tracks. We are working with the health authorities to implement a swift response that builds on Guinea’s past experience with Ebola, which is transmitted in a similar way,” Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO’s regional director for Africa, said.Here’s all you need to know about Marburg virus:(1.) As per WHO, Marburg is caused by a virus which comes from the same family (Filoviridae or filovirus) as the virus which leads to Ebola disease. It causes hemorrhagic fever, and has a high fatality rate of 88%.(2.) Marburg virus shares its name with the German town of Marburg, which was the site of an outbreak in 1967, which led to the recognition of the disease. Frankfurt, also in Germany, as well as Belgrade, in present day Serbia, also witnessed outbreaks in the same year.(3.) Humans catch this infection mainly through prolonged exposure to mines or caves inhabited by Rousettus bats. Once an individual contracts the virus, it can transmit to others via direct contact with the blood, secretions, bodily fluids of infected people, as well as through surfaces and materials contaminated with such fluids.(4.) Symptoms of the Marburg disease include high fever, severe headache, muscle aches, pains, severe watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain, cramping, nausea and vomiting. Diarrhoea can go on for a week.(5.) As per both WHO and the US CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), currently, there is no approved vaccine or antiviral drug for this disease. However, supportive care therapy, such as rehydration with oral fluids, may ne helpful.(6.) Previously, cases of Marburg virus in Africa have been reported from Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, South Africa and Uganda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/guinea-confirms-first-case-of-marburg-disease-all-you-need-to-know-101628576356069.html
10-08-2021||World||Chinese court upholds Canadian prisoner’s death sentence, escalating tensions||In an escalation of tensions between Beijing and Ottawa, a Chinese court has upheld the death sentence of Robert Schellenberg, a Canadian national, just days before the crucial extradition hearing of Chinese telecom giant Huawei’s CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver. Canada has slammed the death sentence as “arbitrary”.A court in Liaoning province upheld Schellenberg’s death sentence on charges related to drug smuggling. He was originally sentenced to 15 years in prison, but it was changed to capital punishment in January 2019, weeks after Meng was arrested in Vancouver on charges of attempted fraud.Schellenberg was detained by Chinese authorities in December 2014, charged with drug smuggling in January 2015, and sent to jail for 15 years on November 28, 2018.“The facts found in the first trial were clear, the evidence was reliable and sufficient, the conviction was accurate, the sentence was appropriate, and the trial procedures were legal,” the verdict said. In his first trial, he was sentenced for smuggling 222.035kg of meth.Meng’s hearing in a British Columbia court over her proposed extradition to the US, as sought by Washington, is expected to be completed on August 20. In statement reacting to the Schellenberg verdict, Canada’s foreign minister Marc Garneau said Canada “strongly condemns” the decision, opposes the death penalty, and condemns “the arbitrary nature” of the sentence.“We have repeatedly expressed to China our firm opposition to this cruel and inhumane punishment and will continue to engage with Chinese officials at the highest levels to grant clemency to Mr. Schellenberg,” Garneau said.Stating that Global Affairs Canada, the country’s foreign ministry, will continue to provide to Schellenberg and his family, Garneau thanked Australia, France, Germany and the US as their representatives were present at the court along with Canadian officials.Beijing has also formally charged two Canadians, ex-diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, with spying since the diplomatic hostilities began.The verdict for one, Spavor, is expected to be out on Wednesday, an anonymous Canadian source directly familiar with the matter told Reuters. A second source familiar with the matter confirmed Spavor’s verdict is due this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-court-upholds-canadian-prisoner-s-death-sentence-escalating-tensions-101628573779595.html
10-08-2021||World||US and China clash over South China Sea disputes at UN Security Council meeting||The United States and China clashed over Beijing’s actions in the South China Sea at a high-level UN Security Council meeting on maritime security Monday that also put a spotlight on attacks on ships in the Persian Gulf, piracy in the Gulf of Guinea, and drug and human trafficking in the Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose country holds the council presidency this month and chaired the virtual meeting, warned that the world’s oceans and seas which are the common heritage of all nations and peoples are facing various threats. He pointed to piracy and terrorism, the erection of trade barriers by some countries, and challenges from climate change and natural disasters.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken responded to China’s increasingly assertive claims to parts of the South China Sea, despite the ruling of an international tribunal five years ago rejecting its claims, by warning that conflict there or in any ocean “would have serious global consequences for security and for commerce.”“In the South China Sea, we’ve seen dangerous encounters between vessels at sea and provocative actions to advance unlawful maritime claims,” he said. “The United States has been clear its concerns regarding actions to intimidate and bully other states lawfully accessing their maritime resources.”In the latest incident last month, China’s military said it chased a US warship from an area that it claims in the South China Sea, a statement the US Navy called false.Blinken stressed that it is “the business, and even more the responsibility,” of the United States and all other countries “to defend the rules that we’ve all agreed to follow, and peacefully resolve maritime disputes.”China’s deputy ambassador, Dai Bing, shot back by accusing the United States of becoming “the biggest threat to peace and stability in the South China Sea” and calling its “hype” in the Security Council “entirely politically motivated.”He called the arbitration tribunal’s award to the Philippines “invalid and without any binding force,” claiming that “there were obvious errors in the determination of facts.”The situation in the South China Sea is generally stable, he said, and Beijing is striving to reach a code of conduct for the sea with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations.Dai also said the US “has no credibility on maritime issues” because it isn’t a party to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which defines the rights and responsibilities of nations in their use of the world’s oceans. The US has not ratified the convention, which came into effect in 1994, but has said it recognises the treaty as part of international customary law.Blinken told the council that when any country faces no consequences for unlawful maritime activities “it fuels greater impunity and instability everywhere.”Elsewhere, he said, countries “are also provocatively and unlawfully advancing their interests,” pointing to Iranian actions in the Persian Gulf and Russia’s in Ukraine’s internationally recognized territorial waters in the Black Sea, Kerch straits and Sea of Azov.Blinken said Washington is ”confident” that Iran attacked the Mercer oil tanker on July 29 off Oman using explosive drones, killing a Briton and Romanian. This is “part of a pattern of attacks and other provocative behavior” by Tehran that “threaten freedom of navigation through this crucial waterway, international shipping and commerce, and the lives of people on the vessels onboard,” he said.He was also sharply critical of Russia, which has worked steadily to bolster its zone of control around Ukraine's Crimea peninsula since it annexed it in 2014. “We see continued aggressive actions against Ukraine, with dangerous incursions on the sea and in the air and harassment of vessels which are disrupting commerce and energy access,” he said.Modi called for removal of barriers to legitimate maritime trade that threaten the world economy, resolving maritime disputes peacefully, and jointly fighting maritime threats from cyclones, tsunamis, pollution, piracy and over-fishing.Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a very rare Security Council appearance, called for “peaceful and responsible uses of maritime spaces” and said that as a leading maritime power his country “is doing a lot to maintain and strengthen international rule of law in maritime security.”“We aim to help ensure security in the area of the Persian Gulf, in the Gulf of Guinea, in the Atlantic Ocean where we have seen a growing number of maritime robberies and hostage-taking,” he said. “This situation is aggravated by the fact that some countries cannot fight against trans-national crime syndicates, pirates and terrorists on their own.”Putin, who spoke before Blinken and made no mention of Crimea, proposed establishing “a special structure within the UN system” to deal directly with fighting maritime crime in various regions. He said it should engage experts, civil society representatives, academia and the private sector.Ghada Waly, director-general of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, told the council that the time-honored freedom of navigation “has come increasingly under threat.”She cited “acute challenges” from piracy, armed robbery, terrorism and trafficking in drugs, humans, waste, nuclear materials and firearms as well as illegal fishing and unlawful damage to the marine environment. She also warned of the “critical vulnerability" of submarine cables carrying the world's internet traffic.She said record shipments of cocaine were seized in European ports during the pandemic according to her office’s 2021 World Drug Report.As for piracy, Waly said 90% of kidnapping incidents have occurred in the Gulf of Guinea, where a new study found that “some six pirate groups, with 30 to 50 members each," can now attack in deeper waters, mainly targeting international vessels to kidnap crew members for ransom.The pirates' combined income has been estimated at some $4 million per year, but the economic impact has been estimated around $800 million, she said. The first half of 2020 saw a 20% increase in piracy and armed robbery incidents against ships compared to the same period in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-and-china-clash-over-south-china-sea-disputes-at-un-security-council-meeting-101628563844164.html
10-08-2021||World||Japan’s Yoshihide Suga gets no Olympics boost as he heads into election||Support for Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga fell to new lows in three media polls, showing the Tokyo Olympics did little to shore up his approval ahead of a general election that must be held by the end of November.Suga’s initially high support was hit by disapproval of his handling of the pandemic, with the current wave of infections bringing case numbers to their worst levels yet, though death rates remain relatively low. A slow start to vaccinations means less than one-third of the population is fully immunized.A survey by the Yomiuri newspaper carried out between Aug. 7-9 found support for Suga’s cabinet at 35%, the lowest since he took office in September. A separate survey by broadcaster JNN put support at 32.6%, also a fresh low, while a third poll published by the Asahi newspaper found support had tumbled below 30%, often cited as crisis level for Japanese leaders.Much of the public opposed Suga’s decision to press ahead with staging the games, amid fears it could become a super-spreader event. Relatively few cases were directly linked to the Olympics, which ended Sunday, although experts said the event may have prompted a more relaxed attitude toward virus precautions, and thus worsened the spread.Olympics a Hit for Japan Athletes, Not for Its LeaderMore than 60% of respondents to the JNN survey said they disapproved of Suga’s handling of the coronavirus, and a similar number said they didn’t agree with a new policy of hospitalizing only serious cases and those at risk of suffering serious symptoms. Some 84 people were found to have died of the virus at home in the first six months of this year, NHK reported.Japan PM’s Plan to Have Mild Virus Cases Stay Home Sparks AngerWhile 60% of respondents to the JNN survey said they believed the Olympics had led to an increase in Covid cases, a majority of respondents to all three polls said they were glad the Olympics had gone ahead.Initially elected to take over the last year of Shinzo Abe’s term as leader of the Liberal Democratic Party following his resignation last year, Suga must win his own term as party president in a vote due next month. Two-thirds of respondents to the Yomiuri survey said the party should pick a different leader, with former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba the most popular choice to take over.While the opposition doesn’t boast the support to oust the long-ruling LDP in the general election, Suga’s unpopularity raises the risk of a loss of seats, potentially undermining his control of the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japans-yoshihide-suga-gets-no-olympics-boost-as-he-heads-into-election-101628562560799.html

According to one diplomat in Kabul, the Taliban has a Quetta Shura or high council and a Miramshah Shura but the most important is the Rawalpindi Shura, reference to the headquarters of ISI, which is the real power behind the Islamist Sunni Pashtun force. "Military capture of Kabul by Taliban will not only give strategic space to Pakistan but also trained terrorist cadre to target their adversaries," said a former Indian foreign secretary.The Taliban have intensified their campaign, capturing five provincial capitals in two days. The latest to fall is Kunduz, the capital of northern Kunduz province. Over the weekend, they took Sar-e-Pul, the headquarters of the northern province of the same name, Zaranj, the capital of western Nimroz province, Sheberghan, the capital of northern Zawzjan province, and Taleqan, the capital of another northern province with the same name in their control.On Monday, the Taliban fighters captured Aybak, capital of the northern province of Samangan. Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province, is also under their control.The Taliban are also targeting Laghman province in east Afghanistan, continuously attacking the area on the border between Abshar Panjshir and Shahin districts. In the west, near the border with Iran, security officials said heavy fighting was under way on the outskirts of Herat. Authorities said that 36 people had been killed and 220 wounded over the past 11 days. More than half of the wounded are civilians.Fierce fighting is going on in Badakhshan too. While the Taliban are hell-bent on capturing the province, the Afghan security forces have deployed a new batch of commando special forces in capital city Faizabad to stop the terror group. Afghan army said in a statement that Taliban fighters attacked Faizabad from four directions on Saturday, but fled after facing stiff resistance. The army further said that 35 attackers were killed and 25 others injured in the gunbattle.The Afghan National Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF) said that 579 Taliban terrorists were killed and 161 others were injured in their operations across Afghanistan on Sunday.President Ashraf Ghani has been holding a series of meetings to find a solution to the Taliban problem. He met prominent political and religious leaders of the country on Sunday and urged their support for the elected government and Afghan security forces. He announced tariff relaxations on basic food items on border crossing posts and ports after the business community of Afghanistan expressed its concern.Those involved in the peace process, like former president Hamid Karzai, have also been holding meetings to stop the Taliban. On Sunday, Karzai met United Nations Secretary-General's Special Representative for Afghanistan Deborah Lyons and Indian Ambassador to Afghanistan Rudrendra Tandon and discussed the current situation in the country.The members of Afghanistan's lower house have claimed that more than 60% of customs revenue is now being collected by the Taliban after they captured border crossing posts. The amount is significant - about 200 million AFN (or $2.5 million) per day. A parliamentarian Abdul Satar Hussaini said that it's unfortunate that the Taliban collects government income and transfers it to Pakistan and demanded a united front against the terror group.The insurgents have captured Babur Ishchi, head of Jawzjan provincial council, who was surrounded by the Taliban along with his 20 fighters after hours of clashes against the group in Khawja Do Koh district last week. Local media reported that he was forced to surrender. Though the Taliban released all his fighters, they took Ishchi with his brother Bator along with them.The US embassy in Kabul condemned these attacks and said that violence is not going to get Taliban the international legitimacy which they are looking for. The embassy stressed that the group should devote its energy to take the peace process forward in place of a military campaign.Charge d'Affaires of the US embassy, Ross Wilson, told a local news media outlet on Sunday that the Taliban have not honoured the commitment made in accordance with the Doha deal. He also argued that Pakistan can play a crucial role in the Afghan peace process in order to end the conflict in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/powered-by-pakistan-taliban-racing-towards-kabul-101628561859589.html

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has said that most of the people are fleeing from northeastern and eastern Afghanistan where the insurgent group is concentrating all its energy to capture the areas and re-establish the Islamic Emirate.The terrorists have ramped up their push across much of Afghanistan, turning their guns on provincial capitals after taking large swaths of land in the mostly rural countryside. They are in control of five of the country's 34 provincial capitals.Watch: Meet the woman training fighters against TalibanThe Taliban fighters attacked the Ahmad Shah Abdali Kandahar Airport on Sunday, firing several rockets on the building. Flight operations were suspended for a few hours following the attack.Toofan Omari, a journalist and head of radio station Paktia Voice, was shot dead by the Taliban fighters in Kabul, according to the police. Omar was also a prosecutor in Paktia province. He was travelling from Bagram to Kabul when his car was ambushed.Revenge attacks and repressive treatment of women have been reported in areas now under Taliban control. The insurgent group kidnapped two policewomen in Ghazni city and have been keeping them at an unknown location.Children are the worst sufferers. Mustapha Ben Messaoud, chief field operations for UNICEF in Afghanistan said that by the end of this year, one in two children under the age of five in Afghanistan will be mentally ill or malnourished due to malnutrition and will not be able to attend school.A heart-wrenching video emerged from the Taliban's recent attack on Takhar province. A toddler was killed in the attack and his sister was seen crying and trying to wake the boy up.With Taliban attacks increasing, Afghan security forces and government troops have retaliated with airstrikes aided by the United States. The fighting has also raised growing concerns about civilian casualties.Helmand health department chief Sher Ali Shakir said Monday that in the previous 24 hours, seven people were killed and 95 were wounded in the fighting and were transferred to hospitals in the province.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-on-warpath-targets-innocents-and-civilians-in-afghanistan-101628560845534.html
10-08-2021||World||Prince Andrew is sued by Jeffrey Epstein accuser over alleged sexual abuse when she was 17||Britain's Prince Andrew was sued on Monday for having allegedly on three occasions sexually abused a woman who says she was trafficked for sex by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.In a civil complaint filed in the US District Court in Manhattan, Virginia Giuffre said the Duke of York, Queen Elizabeth's second son, sexually assaulted and battered her about two decades ago, when she was 17 and Epstein was also abusing her."I am holding Prince Andrew accountable for what he did to me," Giuffre, previously known as Virginia Roberts, said in a statement."The powerful and rich are not exempt from being held responsible for their actions," she added. "I hope that other victims will see that it is possible not to live in silence and fear, but to reclaim one's life by speaking out and demanding justice."Spokespeople and lawyers for Andrew could not immediately be reached for comment outside business hours.The prince said in a 2019 BBC interview he had no recollection of meeting Giuffre, and categorically denied her claim of sexual abuse.Andrew, 61, is one of the most prominent people linked to Epstein, who Manhattan federal prosecutors charged in July 2019 with sexually exploiting dozens of girls and women.Epstein, a registered sex offender, killed himself at age 66 in a Manhattan jail on Aug. 10, 2019, while awaiting trial.Prosecutors later said Andrew had not cooperated with their probe.Threats AllegedGiuffre has said she was a victim of Epstein's sex trafficking and abuse from 2000 to 2002, starting at age 16.In her complaint, Giuffre said Andrew forced her to have unwanted sexual intercourse at the London home of Epstein's longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite.Giuffre said Andrew also abused her at Epstein's mansion on Manhattan's Upper East Side, and on a private island that Epstein owned in the US Virgin Islands.The complaint said Giuffre "was compelled by express or implied threats" by Epstein, Maxwell or Andrew to engage in sexual acts with Andrew, fearing repercussions for disobedience."Andrew's wealth, power, position, and connections enabled him to abuse a frightened, vulnerable child with no one there to protect her," the complaint said.Giuffre has said Epstein brought her to London to meet Andrew, and kept her as a "sex slave" with help from Maxwell, the daughter of late British media mogul Robert Maxwell.Signed by Giuffre's lawyer David Boies, the complaint accused Andrew of battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. It seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.Lawyers for Ghislaine Maxwell, who is not a defendant in the lawsuit, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Andrew Denied Alleged AbuseIn a November 2019 interview now widely regarded as a public relations disaster, Andrew told the BBC he could not have had sex with Giuffre at Maxwell's home because he had returned that night to his house after a children's party."I can absolutely, categorically tell you it never happened," Andrew said. "I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever."Andrew also called Epstein's behavior "unbecoming," but said he did not regret their friendship.Soon after the interview, Andrew stepped down from royal duties, as charities and other organizations distanced themselves from him.Monday's complaint included a widely circulated photo of Giuffre and Andrew, both smiling, standing next to each other, with Giuffre wearing a pink tank top.Giuffre said the photo was taken at Maxwell's home before Andrew's alleged abuse.Maxwell previously settled a separate civil defamation lawsuit by Giuffre.She has separately pleaded not guilty to engaging in sex trafficking and grooming underage girls for Epstein to abuse. Her trial in Manhattan could begin in November.Giuffre sued Andrew under the Child Victims Act, a New York state law allowing many child abuse victims to pursue claims against their alleged abusers, even if the abuse occurred decades earlier.A window to bring many such claims expires this week.Earlier on Monday, the administrator of a fund to compensate Epstein's victims said she has completed the payout process, giving more than $121 million to about 138 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-andrew-is-sued-by-jeffrey-epstein-accuser-over-alleged-sexual-abuse-when-she-was-17-101628559217412.html

10-08-2021||World||Covid-19: Pentagon seeks vaccine mandate for US troops||The Pentagon on Monday said that it will seek US President Joe Biden’s approval to require military members to get vaccinated against Covid-19 by the middle of September.Biden last month urged local governments to pay people to get vaccinated against Covid-19, and he set new rules requiring federal workers to provide proof of vaccination or face regular testing, mask mandates and travel restrictions.At the time, the American president had directed the Pentagon to look into “how and when” it will require members of the military to take the vaccine. The defence department is targeting mid-September for a vaccination deadline based on expectations for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to give full approval to the Pfizer vaccine. It currently falls under an emergency use authorisation (EUA).“By way of expectation, public reporting suggests the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine could achieve full FDA licensure early next month,” a memo from defence secretary Lloyd Austin said.France’s pass required in restaurants, trainsFrance took a big step on Monday by requiring people to show a QR code proving they have a Covid pass before they can enjoy in restaurants and cafes or travel across the country. The move came amid fierce protests in the country against such passes.The pass is issued to people who are vaccinated against Covid-19, or have proof of a recent recovery from the disease or who have a recent negative Covid-19 test.In China, authorities have punished a slew of officials for failing to curb a Covid-19 outbreak spanning nearly 900 symptomatic infections across the country in less than a month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-pentagon-seeks-vaccine-mandate-for-us-troops-101628556484896.html

How can such questions be asked in the UPSC examination? These are politicised issues. We did not expect UPSC to behave like this. This is condemnable," Bandyopadhyay said."UPSC is behaving like an organ of a political party. UPSC is trusted and respected by people. Never before questions like this were asked.

Himachal Pradesh reported 2,086 active cases on Monday while the positivity rate stood at 1.9%, a health official told news agency PTI.Thakur said the recent spike in cases remains a matter of concern and that experts are unsure about the future trajectory of the Covid-19 situation. There are six districts in Himachal Pradesh which are showing a rising trend in daily new Covid-19 cases in the last 14 days, the health ministry said on Tuesday.The health ministry highlighted that Himachal Pradesh has an R-value of 1.3. R-value of a disease indicates the effective reproduction rate or the ability of a disease to spread.Himachal Pradesh saw a recent spike in Covid-19 cases which has created concern among experts. The government is also concerned about the incoming tourists which they fear could contribute to the rise in cases. It also made negative Covid-19 test reports mandatory and fully vaccinated people to enter the state.Earlier in social media, several pictures and videos were shared where tourists were seen flouting Covid-19 rules. The state saw an influx of tourists as Covid-19 guidelines were relaxed across the country and also due to the heat during the months of June and July in northwestern states. Chief minister Jairam Thakur earlier said that tourists cannot be stopped but people can still adhere to rules and regulations set to curb the spread of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/himachal-cm-expresses-concern-over-covid-19-surge-active-cases-rise-to-2086-101628615858842.html

During its passage, 385 members of Parliament voted in its favour while no members opposed it. The bill was passed with bipartisan support but MPs from both sides during the discussion before the passage blamed each other's parties for not doing enough for the OBC communities.Union minister Virendra Kumar initiated the discussion saying that the bill be passed to allow states and Union Territories to prepare their own Socially and Economically Backward Classes (SEBCs) list.Lawmakers agree but with few differencesUnion minister and Apna Dal MP Anupriya Patel said that representation is necessary for the upliftment of backward classes. “Several communities continue to demand their inclusion among the Other Backward Classes but due to the Supreme Court ruling the state governments’ hands were tied. The amendment brought forth by the government allows state governments to take these decisions.” Patel said.Patel attacked the Congress for failing to give constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes when it was in power. She said that PM Modi-led NDA did it in 2018 for the welfare of the people who belonged to these groups. She also said that the NDA took the decision to increase the creamy layer limit from ₹6 lakh to ₹8 lakh and also make provisions for admissions of students from OBC communities to Kendriya Vidyalayas, Jawahar Navodyaya Vidyalayas and Sainik Schools.All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen MP Asaduddin Owaisi said the BJP is doing it for votes and said that it should have the courage of ‘breaking the ceiling’ of 50% reservation. He highlighted that the decision to give Scheduled Castes reservation in 1950 was on a religious basis and said it was against the right to equality. “This is a golden chance. Make it religion-neutral. If there is provision for including Hindus, Buddhists and Sikhs in Scheduled Castes then why can Muslims, Dalits and Christians not be a part of it?” Owaisi asked. He also questioned the government that out of 89 secretaries, how many of them belong to the OBC community.Former UP chief minister and SP MP Akhilesh Yadav, BSP MP Ritesh Panday and other opposition leaders extended support to the bill but said that the Bharatiya Janata Party is being divisive citing that people from the OBC communities are not able to fully avail the benefits and increase their representation.Why is the bill needed?The bill is needed because if the state list gets nullified, then more than 600 OBC communities would lose access to reservations in appointments as well as in educational institutions thus impacting at least one-fifth of the total OBC communities.The need for this amendment arose after the Supreme Court in its Maratha reservation ruling upheld the 102nd Constitutional Amendment Act. The Supreme Court, however, said that the President, depending on the recommendations made by the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) which would decide which communities would be part of the state OBC list.The 102nd Constitution Amendment Act of 2018 inserted Article 342A along with Article 338B and Article 342. While Articles 338B dealt with the powers of NCBC, Article 324A allowed the President to decide with the governor which socially and educationally backward classes would make it to the list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-can-now-maintain-list-of-socially-and-educationally-backward-classes-101628615327528.html

Online classes will also continue for students who are unable to attend physical classes.Earlier, Punjab Assembly Leader of Opposition and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Harpal Singh Cheema had sought to know on the basis of which “report of doctors and education experts” did the state government make “such a big decision” as the matter pertains to the life of 60.5 lakh children – constituting 20 per cent of the state’s population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/8-days-after-schools-reopen-in-punjab-20-students-test-positive-for-covid19-101628613452604.html
10-08-2021||India||RT-PCR test report mandatory for buying liquor from shops in Kerala||The Kerala government made a negative RT-PCR test report mandatory for people queuing up at liquor shops as the test positivity rate of Covid-19 reached the highest in three months on Tuesday. The state, which is contributing more than 50 per cent of the country's daily caseload, on Tuesday reported 21,119 new infections, and the test positivity rate was 15.91. Those who have been vaccinated will have to show their vaccine certificates at the liquor shop, the new directive issued late on Tuesday night said. The state government is trying to strike a balance between restrictions and relaxations as in the last few days, it has issued orders withdrawing Saturday lockdown and allowing shops in the malls to be open. But at the same time, it has warned of imposing a triple lockdown if there is a sudden spurt in the number of cases in any area. The government also mandated vaccination for visiting any shops, an order which has drawn flak and created confusion. Health minister Veena George in the state assembly justified the move and said these restrictions are only for the time being. With a reproduction rate of 1.12, Kerala is projected to witness cumulative incidence cases of 4.64 lakh, the Union health ministry said on Tuesday, warning against crowding during the upcoming Onam festivities. The state government too on Tuesday evening barred big gatherings for Onam.Regarding the new vaccination rule for visiting shops, Congress leader K Babu in the assembly said that going by the new rules, only senior citizens will be able to visit shops as they are fully vaccinated. Only 28 per cent of the youth have been vaccinated in the state, the Congress leader had said.The Centre on Tuesday said Kerala's Covid-19 situation spiralled for many reasons. Delta, less seroprevalence, in-house transmission, older population with a higher prevalence of diabetes all contributed to turning Kerala into a Covid hotspot again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rtpcr-test-report-mandatory-for-buying-liquor-from-shops-in-kerala-101628613878323.html

10-08-2021||India||Indians told to leave Afghanistan, officials to be evacuated from Mazar-e-Sharif||India on Tuesday advised its nationals in Afghanistan to make immediate arrangements to return home even as it began the process of evacuating its officials and citizens from the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif following advances made by Taliban fighters. A security advisory issued by the Indian embassy in Kabul called on Indians to make travel arrangements before commercial air services are discontinued, and asked Indian firms operating in Afghanistan to immediately withdraw Indian employees from project sites before air services get affected. All India-based officials and security personnel from the Indian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif and a small number of Indian nationals living in and around Afghanistan’s fourth-largest city were to be evacuated in a special flight late on Tuesday, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The exact number of people being brought back to India couldn’t be ascertained. The move came exactly a month after India evacuated some 50 officials and security personnel from the consulate in the southern city of Kandahar on July 10 following intense clashes between Afghan forces and Taliban fighters in the area. The Indian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif, which was the only fully functional consulate out of four such missions across Afghanistan, asked Indian nationals to take the evacuation flight. “A special flight is leaving from Mazar-e-Sharif to New Delhi. Any Indian nationals in and around Mazar-e-Sharif are requested to leave for India in the special flight scheduled to depart late today evening,” the consulate tweeted. It asked Indian citizens wishing to take the flight to provide their names and passport numbers. There was no official word on the development from the external affairs ministry. Fears of a Taliban assault on Mazar-e-Sharif, the capital of Balkh province, have grown since the group took over the northern cities of Kunduz and Aibak. However, hours after the Indian consulate posted its tweet, the Afghan media quoted Balkh governor Mohammad Farhad Azimi as saying that the Afghan troops had pushed back a Taliban offensive on Mazar-e-Sharif. Azimi said the Taliban retreated after facing strong resistance from Afghan forces during clashes on Monday night. “The Taliban have focused their attention on Balkh province to take control,” Azimi told Tolo News. The people cited above said the strength of the Indian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif was reduced recently because of the Taliban intensifying its campaign to overrun provincial capitals and urban centres. The consulate has been without a head since the last consul general, Vinesh Kalra, died of Covid-19 in Kabul in May. Tuesday’s security advisory from the Indian embassy in Kabul was the third such alert issued since June 29 and reiterated a warning to avoid non-essential travel because of a serious threat of kidnapping. It added commercial air travel services to many provinces and cities were being discontinued with the escalation of violence. “All Indian nationals visiting, staying and working in Afghanistan are strongly advised to keep themselves updated on the availability of commercial flights from various parts of Afghanistan and make immediate travel arrangements to return to India before commercial air services are discontinued to their place of stay/visit in Afghanistan,” the alert said. “Indian companies operating in Afghanistan are strongly advised to immediately withdraw their Indian employees out of project sites in Afghanistan before air travel services get discontinued. Indian nationals working for Afghan or foreign companies in Afghanistan should immediately request their employer to facilitate their travel from project sites to India,” it added. The embassy said the advisory was also valid for Indian media personnel, who should contact the mission’s public affairs and security wing for a personalised briefing, “including specific advice for the location they are travelling to”. This, it added, will help the media make a better assessment of “risks involved, given the rapid changes in security situation taking place in different parts of the country”. According to information provided by the government to Parliament last week, there are currently some 1,500 Indian nationals in Afghanistan. Most of them are workers and professionals engaged for the hundreds of development projects being implemented by the Indian government under its pledges of $3 billion for reconstruction and development efforts. The last security advisory issued on July 24 had said the security situation “remains dangerous in several provinces”. It said terror groups had escalated violent activities including targeting civilians. “Indian nationals are not exceptions, and they additionally face a serious threat of kidnapping,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indians-told-to-leave-afghanistan-officials-to-be-evacuated-from-mazaresharif-101628609182286.html
10-08-2021||India||'Extremely satisfying': Captain on first meet with Sonia post Sidhu's elevation||Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh met Congress president Sonia Gandhi in Delhi on Tuesday evening amid talks of a possible cabinet reshuffle in the state. This is the first meeting between Singh, a former Army captain, and the Congress interim chief since the elevation of Navjot Singh Sidhu as the party’s Punjab unit president despite the CM’s opposition.Quoting the CM, Singh’s media advisor Raveen Thukral wrote on Twitter, “Met Congress president Sonia Gandhi in Delhi this evening to discuss various state-related issues. Spent an extremely satisfying one hour with her.”Later, Punjab Congress in-charge Harish Rawat said Gandhi is likely to have advised the state government and party organisation to work together. “Both of them (Singh and Sidhu) have to work within their respective limits, but by cooperating with each other,” Rawat was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Rawat was part of a team that was assigned the task of resolving infighting and dissent within the Punjab Congress. The state is set to see Assembly election next year.When asked if all issues between the two senior leaders of Punjab have been resolved, Rawat said, “Singh has not said that he is upset with Sidhu. You (media) yourself are contemplating this. This is not the statement of the Captain.”Singh also met Union Home Minister Amit Shah during his visit to the National Capital when he sought 25 companies of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) and anti-drone gadgets for the BSF amif a heightened security threat ahead of Independence Day on August 15 and Assembly election next year.Punjab CM @capt_amarinder urges @AmitShah to intervene to resolve #FarmerProtest & repeal #FarmLaws to prevent inimical forces from exploiting their anger. Cites social, economic & security implications of prolonged farmers’ agitation. pic.twitter.com/toso4fLEkoSingh also urged the home minister’s intervention to resolve the months-long farmers’ protest along the borders of Delhi seeking repeal of three central farm laws. Singh cited social, economic and security implications of the prolonged farmers’ agitation.'While the farmers’ protest has so far been largely peaceful, one can sense rising tempers, especially as Punjab moves towards elections in early 2022. There's urgent need to review and repeal the farm laws,” Thukral quoted the chief minister as telling Shah.“At the meet with Shah, Singh also raised concerns over DAP shortage aggravating farmers' resentment. Urged him to direct the fertilizers department to increase stocks' allocation to state and to also ask suppliers to ensure that supplies are given as per schedule,” Thukral further wrote on Twitter.The chief minister’s office later said Singh also spoke about some leaders, including those belonging to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiv Sena, refusing to take security despite inputs of threats. “Citing inputs from central and state agencies, Punjab CM said potential targets incl trains, buses and temples, prominent farmer leaders (specific inputs on 5 such leaders was received but they had refused to take security), RSS offices, RSS/BJP/Shiv Sena leaders based in Punjab,” the CMO said.Later, Singh hosted a dinner for Congress MPs from Punjab at his Delhi residence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-meets-sonia-in-delhi-for-first-time-post-sidhu-s-elevation-101628608441213.html

10-08-2021||India||Reservation and reconciliation both have to go hand in hand: RSS leader||Referring to caste-based reservation as an instrument of affirmative action that has an important role to play in social justice and equality, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale on Tuesday said that reservation and reconciliation (between communities) have to go hand in hand.He also said that the political, cultural, social and spiritual history of India will be incomplete and untrue without the contribution of Dalits.Speaking at the launch of a book, Makers of Modern Dalit History, authored by Guru Prakash Paswan and Sudarshan Ramabadran, Hosabale asserted that he and his organisation were staunch supporters of caste-based reservation.“I have been a staunch supporter of reservation…In western countries, in Europe and in America, there has been an effort for reconciliation on the part of the African Blacks. Reservation and reconciliation both have to go hand-in-hand,” he said. He later argued that while reservation was a historic necessity, reconciliation was for the future.While the opponents of the Sangh have accused it of opposing caste-based reservation that allows quotas for Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) communities in government jobs and education institutions; Hosabale reiterated that the RSS has been at the forefront of denouncing casteism.“When we discuss the various aspects of Dalit community and the Scheduled Tribe sections of the society, invariably certain aspects come to the fore; one of them is reservation. My organisation and I have been staunch supporters of reservation since decades. In 1980, when there was an anti-reservation movement on some campuses, we passed a resolution [in its favour] and organised a seminar in Patna. Time and again we have said [that] reservation is a historic necessity for the country for many more decades, as long as there is any inequality being experienced by [a] particular section or segment of the society,” he said.On the issue of identities within the Dalit communities, he said he has observed that it was emerging, but it was too early to say whether it was good or bad for society. “I stay in Uttar Pradesh and travel across the country, and I meet a lot of people across sections. I have felt an experience … identity is not limited to Dalit itself; within Dalits the question of identities is being deliberately raised by intellectuals. I am not saying whether I am for it or against it, I am only making an observation. It is too early to say whether such a development is good for the society or not,” he said.The RSS functionary went on to say that social harmony and social justice were not political strategies but articles of faith for the Sangh.The RSS, which is the ideological fount of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, has been running samajik samarasta or social harmony campaigns to end discrimination on the basis of caste. The campaign had become the genesis for the BJP’s social engineering strategy which aims to expand its base among the other backward castes that have been socially and economically deprived by giving them political representation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reservation-and-reconciliation-both-have-to-go-hand-in-hand-rss-leader-101628607081999.html

The blast took place at 1.30pm in the parking lot of Iew Shillong market.The injured have been identified as Christine Nongkynrih, a resident of Mawiong in the suburbs of Shillong and Alan Laloo, a resident of Laitumkhrah. Nongkynrih, who was busy cleaning her tiny tea shop under the parking lot, was thrown a few feet away by the impact of the blast. She and the other injured have been discharged after required medical intervention, police said.East Khasi Hills superintendent of police (SP) S Nongtnger confirmed that the blast was caused by an IED (improvised explosive device). “It was a low intensity blast and only two persons received minor injuries. The HNLC has already claimed responsibility on its fb page and we are already on the job we have been tasked to do,” he said.Though the police claim that HNLC is now weakened, lately the outfit has triggered low intensity blasts in several areas, particularly in Khasi and Jaiñtia hills, which is rich in coal and also home to over a dozen cement companies. The last blast took place in the Police Reserve quarters of the special Meghalaya police unit at Khliehriat on July 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meghaylaya-low-intensity-ied-blast-in-shillong-market-injures-2-101628605282557.html

The issue of booster dose and whether India's vaccination drive will require this has recently been discussed by the national expert group, Dr Paul said."We are watching the science for the need for such booster dose. World Health Organization has called for a moratorium. Booster dose and whether there is a need for it and who will need it is a very relevant issue. Let's say it's a work in progress -- in fact, science is a work in progress," Dr Paul said.A booster dose is a third dose which some countries are seriously considering to increase the protection against Covid infection. Israel has started administering this dose while reports are claiming that unauthorised booster doses are being administered in the United States. France, Germany, Finland are also mulling booster doses.Also Read | Covaxin booster dose: What is it? What does govt say about this?Why WHO has opposed to booster shots nowThe World Health Organization has ethical objection to the third dose of Covid vaccine at a time when some countries have not proceeded beyond the first dose. High-income countries that can now afford to jump into a booster dose represent a very less proportion of the world's population. WHO's call for a halt at present is more for an ethical reason while the medical need for a booster dose is still an issue for debate.Will Indian need a booster dose? What experts sayAs Dr Paul said, the issue is being studied. Many doctors have said that booster doses may be required every year if new strains keep on emerging. AIIMS chief Dr Rabndeep Guleria earlier said that booster shots might be required for emerging variants. But before a booster dose, people should get their first two doses on priority, Dr Paul said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-for-covid-booster-dose-in-india-under-close-watch-says-govt-101628603810842.html
10-08-2021||India||J&K youth travelling to Pakistan on visas, coming back as terrorists: DGP||Expressing concerns over local youth going to Pakistan on student or tourist visits and ending up becoming terrorists, Jammu and Kashmir Director General of Police Dilbag Singh spoke about the need to tighten security clearance measures. He said, “I think guns are given preference over pens in Pakistan and therefore, there is a need to strengthen our measures to give security clearance for Pakistani visas."“If youths go for study (in Pakistan) and join terrorism there, then we definitely need to tighten the process of security clearance for study and other visas for travel to Pakistan."Many young men went to Pakistan on valid documents pertaining to student or tourist visas in 2017-18. We have come across 57 such cases where these youth got involved in terror activities and 17 of them were killed in encounters after infiltrating through the border," the top police officer said.There are still 13 more such young men who have been identified and are active terrorists, he said, adding 17 more are still in Pakistan and “we are watching their activities"."There was a talk about why strictness was imposed on travel to Pakistan…This is the main reason for it. What type of atmosphere they come across in Pakistan and they become terrorists. It is evident we need to take strict measures and strengthen the security clearance system before giving student visas," he said.He further said that following a phase of 'zero infiltration' in the wake of a renewed ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan in February, fresh attempts are being made to push terrorists from across the border where 250 to 300 militants are trained and waiting on the launch pads. Shelling and firing had also stopped completely."The training camps and launch pads being run by Pakistan's ISI and other agencies are full to their capacity. We generally assume the number of terrorists at such camps remains between 250 and 300 who are trained and ready for launching into Jammu and Kashmir," Singh said whil talking to reporters in the border district of Rajouri."The infiltration (of terrorists) from different launch pads has started again recently. We had three encounters in Rajouri-Poonch, including Dadal in Nowshera, Sunderbani and the recent Pangai (Thanamandi) and one in Bandipora. All these were fresh groups of infiltrators and we have information that the activity across the border is still on and there is a possibility of more such attempts (in future),” the police chief said.There has been a spurt in militant attacks in Kashmir over the past few days. A grenade was hurled earlier in the day at security forces in Srinagar. On Monday, a BJP leader and his wife were shot dead in Kulgam.He said the security forces are fully alert and as “impure actions (of Pakistan) is continuing, our border grid is working satisfactorily” which led to the foiling of four infiltration attempts since July.The DGP said four terrorists who had infiltrated from Machil-Gurez sector of north Kashmir were eliminated in Bandipora on July 23-24."They were launched from the Kail sector of Pakistan and as per our information, there were 14 more people when they were launched into this side,” Singh said.He said three to four groups crossed from Pakistan into Rajouri-Poonch sector and a joint search operation is on to track down the terrorists who managed to flee the three encounters in July and August."As per our assessment, three to four groups crossed into this side and some of them were neutralised in the first two contacts (in Nowshera and Sunderbani in July). Two more terrorists were eliminated in the latest encounter (in Thanamandi) on Friday last, while the search is on for two others who are believed part of the group," he said.He said there is a possibility of one more group which has managed to sneak into this side (Rajouri) and is believed to have either crossed into Shopian district of south Kashmir or still holed up in the region. The operation to track them down is on.The DGP said a family from Shopian claimed that one of the two terrorists killed in Thanamandi was their son Rameez Ahmad who had gone to Pakistan some time back."We have taken the DNA sample and the things will get cleared once the report is received," he said. Singh said the infiltrating group comprised both local and Pakistani terrorists."In the Bandipora encounter, two locals and Pakistani militants were killed," the police chief said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-youth-travelling-to-pakistan-on-visas-coming-back-as-terrorists-dgp-101628603552487.html
10-08-2021||India||Rules you should know before buying railway tickets from reservation counters||Indian Railways made it mandatory for passengers to enter their destination address and pin code while booking a ticket from reservation counters. The move by the Indian Railways was initiated last year in order to carry out contact tracing during the first wave of the pandemic.Indian Railways will also not issue any railway ticket if the full address and pin code are not mentioned while booking the ticket. A recent report said there were long queues of passengers at the Dhanbad railway station as they searched for their pin codes of their destinations at the reservation counter. The report also highlighted that several passengers who are not literate faced troubles while booking their tickets.Indian Railways introduced this rule last year during Covid-19 citing that if a passenger tests positive then the Railways would have their travel history.Railways record surge in ticket bookingsAs the Covid-19 second wave wanes, the Indian Railways reported a boost in the number of passengers. The Indian Railways in June said that it carried 32.56 lakh passengers from states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand, with a huge chunk of passengers being migrant workers returning to their workplaces.No plans to restore concessionsThe government told the Parliament that there is no proposal yet to restore concessions offered to certain categories of people due to the ongoing pandemic. “In view of the pandemic and Covid protocol, concession to all categories of passengers (except four categories of Divyangjan, 11 categories of patients and students) have been withdrawn from March 20, 2020, till further advice. At present, there is no proposal to restore the concessions,” Union minister for railways Ashwini Vaishnaw told Parliament last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rules-you-should-know-before-buying-railway-tickets-from-reservation-counters-101628602232900.html
10-08-2021||India||Chhattisgarh: Wild elephant died due to electrocution in Jashpur||A wild elephant was found dead on Tuesday morning after it was electrocuted in Jashpur district of Chhattisgarh, officials said. “The elephant came into the village smelling the stock of rice in a warehouse, kept under Public Distribution Scheme (PDS) and ransacked it before coming in contact with a live wire supplying electricity to a sub health centre,” said Shrikrishna Jadhav, a forest official. The incident took place in Amdiha village under Tapkara forest range of the district.Forest officials have said that separate herds of over 50 elephants have been roaming in forests of Pathalgaon, Tapkara and Kunkuri areas of Jashpur district for the last couple of days. As per the forest department, 45 elephants have died due to various reasons while 204 people were killed in elephant attacks across Chhattisgarh in the last three years. Total 18 elephant deaths took place in 2020 while 2019 and 2018 saw 11 and 16 elephant deaths respectively. Recently, Chhattisgarh government decided to dump paddy outside north Chhattisgarh villages, falling in elephant pathways, to lure them away from human habitations, where they are drawn by the smell of stored Mahua (a wild flower with strong smell) or paddy.However, several activists alleged that the forest department’s plan to procure paddy for this drive was without a scientific basis and appeared to be an attempt to compensate the state government for losses incurred in acquiring surplus paddy in 2019-20. North Chhattisgarh was home to around 240 wild elephants, which roam in the forest lands in Surguja and nearby regions of the state, often triggering human-elephant conflicts. In the last decade, the state recorded an increase in its wildlife population including elephants, whose numbers rose from 225 to 290, as per the state forest department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-wild-elephant-died-due-to-electrocution-in-jashpur-101628599761419.html

Kerala is projected to witness cumulative incidence cases of 4.64 lakh as the state has a high transmission rate, the report said. Kerala has a reproductive value of 1.12, which means every 100 infected people are spreading the infection to 112 other people, the report added. National Centre for Disease Control's director Dr Sujeet Kumar Singh who headed the central team said that the reopening of tourism, the approaching Onam festival pose a serious threat to Kerala's Covid situation.RT-PCR test for visiting shops is justified, says Kerala health ministerHere are the 10 findings of the central team1. Kerala did not define containment zones according to the Centre's guidelines. There was no buffer zone between containment zones and areas which were not contained.2. Kerala reviewed its containment classification as per 7-day moving average but it actually takes 14 days, Dr Singh said.3. 55 per cent population in Kerala, as found in ICMR's national serosurvey, is still susceptible to Covid infection.4. Delta is another reason for the huge spike as the central team found that 88 to 90 per cent of cases are that of Delta strain.5. Kerala has witnessed a high number of reinfections that is people got infected even after two doses of the vaccine. While this is never ruled out and breakthrough infection is not a new thing either in the world or in India, the number is very high in Kerala.Delta enhances hospitalisation, Delta Plus not that virulent: Health ministry6. According to data, submitted by the district authorities to the Central team, Kerala's Patnamthitta has reported 14,974 cases of reinfections. Among these reinfection cases, 5,042 are those who have been vaccinated with both doses, as claimed by the district authorities.7. Dr Sujeet Singh said the Centre has asked the district authorities to provide more information about reinfection as to how many days after the second dose the reinfection happened, or whether these reinfection cases were severe or not. Only after going through these details, it will be possible to ascertain why Kerala and Patnamthitta specifically reported such a high number of reinfections.8. Kerala is home to a high number of the older population, which too contributed to the unnatural rise. The presence of diabetes in the state is 30 per cent, which also helped in creating a susceptible pool in the state, as this is a co-morbid condition.9. Intra-house transmission is very high in Kerala as 80 per cent of people are on home isolation10. The state had no measure to cut transmission and depended on passive surveillance which involved strict tracking and tracing of new infections. "But it is also important to cut the transmission. We should not achieve herd immunity through natural infection because that will lead to an uncontrollable rise in the number of cases," Dr Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/15000-reinfections-in-kerala-district-10-findings-of-central-team-101628598747357.html
10-08-2021||India||India to citizens in Afghanistan: Make immediate arrangements for return||India on Tuesday advised its nationals in Afghanistan to make immediate travel arrangements to return home before commercial air services are discontinued amid intense fighting between security forces and the Taliban across the war-torn country.A security advisory issued by the Indian embassy also called on Indian companies operating in Afghanistan to immediately withdraw Indian employees from project sites before air services get discontinued. This was the third security alert issued by the mission for Indian citizens since June 29 and it reiterated a warning to avoid non-essential travel because of a serious threat of kidnapping.The alert was issued hours after Indian began the process for evacuating its officials and nationals from the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Indian Air Force aircraft amid reports of an advance by the Taliban.Tuesday’s security advisory said that with the escalation of violence in many parts of Afghanistan, commercial air travel services to many provinces and cities were being discontinued.Also Read | US asks Pakistan to eliminate Taliban safe havens along Afghan-Pak border“All Indian nationals visiting, staying and working in Afghanistan are strongly advised to keep themselves updated on the availability of commercial flights from various parts of Afghanistan and make immediate travel arrangements to return to India before commercial air services are discontinued to their place of stay/visit in Afghanistan,” the alert said.“Indian companies operating in Afghanistan are strongly advised to immediately withdraw their Indian employees out of project sites in Afghanistan before air travel services get discontinued. Indian nationals working for Afghan or foreign companies in Afghanistan should immediately request their employer to facilitate their travel from project sites to India,” it added.The embassy said the security advisory was also valid for Indian media personnel in Afghanistan, who should establish contact with the mission’s public affairs and security wing for a personalised briefing, “including specific advice for the location they are travelling to”. This, it added, will help the media make a better assessment of “risks involved, given the rapid changes in security situation taking place in different parts of the country”.According to information provided by the government to Parliament last week, there are currently some 1,500 Indian nationals in Afghanistan. Most of them are workers and professionals engaged for the hundreds of development projects being implemented by the Indian government under its pledges of $3 billion for reconstruction and development efforts.The last security advisory issued by India on July 24 said the security situation in Afghanistan “remains dangerous in several provinces”. It said terror groups had escalated violent activities including targeting of civilians. “Indian nationals are not exceptions, and they additionally face a serious threat of kidnapping,” it added.Since the previous advisory was issued, the security situation has further deteriorated as the Taliban pushed ahead with their campaign targeting provincial capitals and urban centres after capturing wide swathes of territory in rural areas. The Taliban campaign gained momentum with the withdrawal of most of the US and NATO forces. With the drawdown of foreign troops to be completed by August 31, experts believe the security situation will worsen.Earlier on Tuesday, the Indian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif, which was the only fully functional consulate out of four such missions across Afghanistan, asked Indian nationals to take a special flight that will evacuate officials, diplomats and security personnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-advises-citizens-in-afghanistan-to-make-immediate-arrangements-for-return-101628598081327.html

10-08-2021||India||SC grants bail to Azam Khan, son in forgery case||The Supreme Court on Tuesday granted bail to former Uttar Pradesh minister Azam Khan and his son, Abdullah Khan, in a forgery case. It said the two will be released only after the trial court records the statement of the complainant in the case. The court directed the trial court to complete the exercise within four weeks and file a compliance report before the top court.The two approached the top court after they were denied bail by the Allahabad high court in November 2020. The case against them was filed on the basis of Bharatiya Janata Party leader Akash Saxena’s complaint in 2019. Saxena has accused Azam Khan of obtaining forged identity documents such as a PAN card and Passport for his son to enable him to fight the 2017 assembly elections. A person needs to be aged above 25 to contest elections.The prosecution has said the original birth certificate of Abdullah Khan showed his date of birth as January 1, 1993. But to be eligible to contest elections, he allegedly obtained a new birth certificate showing his date of birth as September 30, 1991. The charge sheet filed in the case accuses the two of forging the PAN card and passport to establish the changed date of birth.Also Read | States cannot withdraw cases against MPs, MLAs without HC nod: SCAppearing for the Uttar Pradesh government, additional solicitor general SV Raju described Azam Khan as a “habitual forger” and cited a case of grabbing property using forged land records pending against him.The Supreme Court noted it was a fit case for bail as Azam Khan was arrested in this forgery case in February 2020 and since then an investigation had been completed and a charge sheet was filed in May last year.A bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and Sanjiv Khanna said this is a case based on documentary evidence. “Is it fair to keep a person in custody when there is evidence on both sides? Already the courts are overflowing with cases, and delay is a systematic problem unless you can assure that the trial will be completed within a fixed time.”Raju said that the accused have moved an application seeking discharge in this case which is listed on Wednesday before the trial court. “The accused is influential, and witnesses are scared of him.” He sought protection for the complainant whose statement is yet to be recorded by the trial court.Senior advocates Kapil Sibal and S Wasim Qadri, who appeared for the two accused, argued this was a case of political vendetta as multiple cases were filed against the two accused without reason.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-grants-bail-to-azam-khan-son-in-forgery-case-101628596341325.html

Then Congress-led state government had nine days between the filing of a petition and the court’s stay. It did not present the case before the court with a strong reason to increase the quota from 14% to 27%,” said Chouhan. “Now, the matter is pending before the court... they are demanding reservation.

The case is related to the fodder scam.The prosecution completed its arguments on August 7 and the defence was to cross examine witnesses next. However, lawyers of 89 out of 110 accused currently on trial in the case prayed before the court on Monday to defer the hearing. The special court has directed the CBI to file its reply by August 11, the next date fixed by the court to hear the matter. Also Read | On its 25th foundation day, RJD bets on Lalu to fire up rank and file“The prosecution has produced 570 witnesses besides exhibiting around 4,000 documents. We have prayed before the court that it would be difficult for the defence to make its arguments in virtual mode. We also want to produce documents before the court. The honourable high court has also given relief in other cases on similar grounds,” said Prabhat Kumar, counsel of Lalu Prasad.CBI counsel BMP Singh, while refusing to share details on the details of their reply, said they would oppose the defence plea. The case is related to fraudulent withdrawal of ₹139.35 crore from Ranchi’s Doranda treasury during 1995-96. Its charge sheet was filed in 2005. Of the different fodder scam cases, the aforesaid case---numbering RC 47 (A)/96---is the biggest case as it involves maximum number of accused (170), highest amount of alleged defalcation money and highest number of prosecution witnesses. The CBI had filed charge sheet against 170 accused in this case, but 70 of them, including former Bihar chief minister Jagannath Mishra, died during the course of trial. Currently, only 110 accused, including Lalu Prasad are facing trial.The RJD chief is currently out on bail after his conviction in three separate fodder scam cases in quick succession.

Niti Aayog (health) member VK Paul said some new findings on Delta, on the other hand, reveals how strong and fast transmissible the variant is. It also increases hospitalisation, Dr Paul said. But as established by recent studies, India has vaccines that are effective against the Delta variant. "We are better placed against Delta," Dr Paul said."Delta variant is ruling the nation, in fact, the world. This variant is responsible for the fresh surge in the world. Delta's transmissibility, the attack rate is more. If I explain it in simple terms, then the transmissibility of the original virus was 100, Alpha was 160 and Delta is 250. Its strength is emerging in front of us now. It is fast and many people are getting infected by one person.," Dr Paul explained."New cases coming from Wuhan has shown that the gap between being exposed to the virus and getting infected is shorter than the previous strains. And the virus load is much bigger. This explains why it's more transmissible. It has also emerged that Delta increases hospitalisation," Dr Paul said.The ministry also published the reproduction rate of the states and said that if the reproduction rate of Covid-19 is higher in any state, it indicates that there will be a rapid spread in future, even if the number of fresh infections at present may not be alarming. The reproductive number helps experts understand the rate at which the virus is spreading. In its weekly briefing on Tuesday, the joint secretary of the Union health ministry Lav Agarwal said the R number of India at present stands at 1, which means one person is spreading the infection to one another person. The R factor will be below the danger level only when it dips below 1.According to health ministry data, Himachal Pradesh, which was flooded with tourists soon after restrictions were eased after the second wave of the pandemic, has a reproduction number of 1.3 and it has an increasing trend. In Punjab, the number is 1.3, which is also increasing. The spread of the infection in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh is 1.1, and the trend is stable. Uttar Pradesh has a reproductive rate of 1.1 with a likely increasing trend. Similarly, Andhra Pradesh has an R factor of 1.0 and a likely increasing trend.The ministry on Tuesday said that 37 districts falling in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Meghalaya and Mizoram are still reporting an increasing trend in daily new cases during the last two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-enhances-hospitalisation-but-delta-plus-not-virulent-health-ministry-101628593746880.html

He further said that more than 80 per cent of fresh cases being reported in Delhi are also of Delta variant, Jain said.Delhi reported 52 new Covid-19 cases, 45 recoveries and one death in the last 24 hours. At present, there are 504 active cases.According to a report in The Times of India, data shared by the health department during a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) found delta variant of Covid-19 was present in 83.3 per cent samples sent for genome sequencing in July. The figures were 81.7 per cent and 88. 6 per cent in May and June, respectively, while in April it was detected in 53.9 per cent. The Delta variant (B.1.617.2) is a sublineage of the Kappa variant that was first detected in Maharashtra.The other strain of the virus that was detected in samples sent for genome sequencing to the National Centre for Disease Control by the Delhi government was the Alpha variant. Dr Arun Gupta, president of the Delhi Medical Council, said the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic is not over yet and dominance of the Delta variant in samples is proof of that. At its peak, the second wave of the virus had wreaked havoc across the national capital earlier this year with a large number of cases and deaths being reported on a daily basis, coupled with a massive shortage of medical oxygen.“The variant is still in circulation. We are seeing fewer cases in Delhi because many people have been exposed to it already,” Dr Gupta was quoted as saying in the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-covid-19-delta-variant-detected-in-80-samples-sent-for-genome-sequencing-101628592357477.html

10-08-2021||India||Why Canada again extended ban on direct flights from India | Explained||At a time when several European countries, including the United Kingdom, France, have relaxed travel restrictions on India because India's Covid-19 situation is improving, Canada again extended the ban of direct flight from India. The decision will be reviewed on or before September 21. This extension will impact students as they will now have to travel to a third country to reach Canada.5th extension in 4 monthsThis is the 5th extension of the ban on direct Indian flights since April. The ban was imposed in April because of the second wave of the pandemic and was later extended. With the consecutive extension of the ban on direct flights, the only way for Indian students who have got admission to Canada schools and varsities is to take a connecting flight to Canada where they will have to obtain a negative RT-PCR certificate from a third country, not India. That third country has to be on the approved list of Canada.Canada opens for US travellers, not IndiansExtending the ban on direct flights from India, Transport Canada said the decision was based "on the latest public health advice from the Public Health Agency of Canada".However, Canada has opened its border for the United States which is reporting new Covid cases crossing 100,000.Who can travel to Canada?Apart from fully vaccinated US citizens, Canada has allowed some relaxation to some other categories as well. Permanent residents of Canada, newly approved immigrants can now travel to Canada. Among these categories, those who are fully vaccinated travellers will not need to quarantine.How Indian students can travel to Canada?The Indian government has asked the Canadian government to lift the ban of direct flights in July, as there is a huge demand for both-way traffic. India's high commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria held meetings with the officials from Air India and Air Canada. The diplomatic push resulted in a leeway for Indian students which is inconvenient but a passage to enter Canada. They have to travel to a third country and get tested there as Canada is not accepting Covid-19 molecular test reports from India. They will also have to stay in that third country for 14 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-canada-again-extended-ban-on-direct-flights-india-explained-101628590538232.html

India is proud to be home to the Asiatic Lion. On World Lion Day, I convey my greetings to all those passionate about lion conservation. It would make you happy that the last few years have seen a steady increase in India’s lion population,” PM Modi tweeted on Tuesday. “When I was serving as Gujarat CM, I had the opportunity to work towards ensuring safe and secure habitats for the Gir Lions. A number of initiatives were taken which involved local communities and global best practices to ensure habitats are safe and tourism also gets a boost.”Also Read | ‘Gave unprecedented benefit to women’: PM Modi launches Ujjwala scheme 2.0The Gujarat Forest department said last June that the Asiatic Lion population in Gir national park has increased by 29% in the past five years — from 523 in 2015 to 674 in 2020. The department also said the distribution area of lions in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat, where Gir is situated, has increased by 36% from 22,000 sqkm in 2015 to 30,000 sqkm.The forest department conducted an exercise in which 1,400 forest guards of 13 divisions were asked to spot lions and report their presence. Based on their reports, the population was estimated. The exercise was called Poonam Avlokan (because it was conducted on full moon night).The Centre hasn’t conducted any census of lions in Gujarat. “We plan to soon start Project Lion which will ensure conservation gaps are addressed,” said a senior environment ministry official who did not wish to be named. He, however, did not comment on whether lions from Gujarat will be translocated to Madhya Pradesh. There was a plan to translocate lions from Gir to Madhya Pradesh’s Kuno Palpur wildlife reserve which has been pending since the 90s.“Project Lion will involve the conservation of lions and their habitat in a holistic manner. There will be a focus on conflict mitigation and technology for management. Reintroduction... we have to see what are the possibilities. Last year, only some financial measures were announced but this project is new and long term,” Soumitra Dasgupta, additional director general (wildlife) had said last year.“Conservation of lions in and around Gir has been a tremendous success. It has staved off extinction which seemed imminent more than a 100 years ago. Even conservation successes need careful long-term monitoring and management. In the case of lions, the single most important conservation action that is needed is the implementation of the Supreme Court mandated translocation to establish a second free-ranging population of lions in Kuno,” said Ravi Chellam, conservation scientist, CEO, Metastring Foundation and member Biodiversity Collaborative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-lauds-conservation-efforts-to-improve-lion-population-in-gujarat-101628588421094.html

Modesty is a woman's most precious jewel, the high court said, adding that there cannot be any "straitjacket formula to ascertain whether it is outraged"."The complainant is a married woman, aged 45 years and the very act of throwing a chit on her person which professes love for her and which contains poetic verses, albeit extremely, purely written is sufficient to outrage the modesty of a woman," the court said, as reported by news agency PTI.Also Read: PIL urges Bombay high court to scrap PG-NEETThe incident took place between a shopkeeper, who was the petitioner of the case, and some Mrs S. On October 3, 2011, the shopkeeper, Shrikrushna Tawari, approached her when Mrs S was washing utensils. The shopkeeper wanted to give her a chit which she refused to accept. He then threw the chit and also said, 'I love you'. The next day, he made some obscene gestures and warned her not to tell anyone about the chit.Based on the complaint, a case was registered against the shopkeeper under Sections 354, 506 and 509 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).In 2018, the sessions court convicted him under Sections 354, 509 and 506 of IPC and sentenced him to two years of rigorous imprisonment. A hefty amount of fine was imposed on Tawari, including the amount that he was asked to pay to the woman as compensation.Tawari challenged the verdict claiming that the woman brought a false case against him. He said the woman had "purchased groceries on credit from his shop and was not inclined to pay the amount". The judge, however, said that he had no reason to disbelieve the evidence of the complainant."I have noted that the applicant has already undergone 45 days of incarceration and considering the date of the incident or commission of the offence, as the provisions of the law stood then, there was no minimum sentence provided for an offence punishable under Section 354 of the IPC. It is only by the 2013 amendment that a minimum sentence is provided. I, therefore, find it appropriate to modify the sentence of imprisonment imposed for offences punishable under Section 354 and 509 of the IPC to the period already undergone," the court added.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/throwing-love-chit-at-a-married-woman-is-insulting-says-bombay-hc-in-a-10-year-old-case-101628584965106.html
10-08-2021||India||India to evacuate officials and nationals from Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan||India on Tuesday began evacuating its diplomats and nationals from Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan following reports of the advance of Taliban fighters amid a violent assault by the group on key cities and urban centres. India also advised all its nationals in Afghanistan to make immediate travel arrangements to return before commercial air services are discontinued.All Indian diplomats and officials from the Indian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif and Indian nationals living in and around the city are to be evacuated in Indian Air Force (IAF) aircraft by Tuesday evening, people familiar with the developments said on condition of anonymity. The exact number of people being evacuated couldn’t immediately be ascertained. The move comes exactly a month after India evacuated some 50 officials and security personnel from the consulate in the southern city of Kandahar on July 10 following intense clashes between Afghan forces and Taliban fighters. Also Read | After PM Modi, Jaishankar heads for UNSC with terrorism on agendaThe Indian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif, which was the only fully functional consulate out of four such missions across Afghanistan, on Tuesday asked Indian nationals to take the special evacuation flight. “A special flight is leaving from Mazar-e-Sharif to New Delhi. Any Indian nationals in and around Mazar-e-Sharif are requested to leave for India in the special flight scheduled to depart late today evening,” the consulate said in a tweet. The consulate asked Indian citizens wishing to leave by the special flight to provide their names and passport numbers. There was no official word on the development from the external affairs ministry. The people cited above said the strength of the Indian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif had been reduced recently in the wake of the Taliban intensifying its campaign to capture territory in rural areas and overrun provincial capitals and urban centres. The consulate has also been without a head since the last consul general, Vinesh Kalra, died of Covid-19 in a hospital in Kabul in May. The Taliban have so far taken over Kunduz and Aibak cities in the north, triggering fears of an assault on Mazar-e-Sharif, the fourth-largest city in Afghanistan and the capital of Balkh province. The officials and security personnel in the consulate in Kandahar were evacuated last month after the Taliban seized key areas near the city in southern Afghanistan. The Indian side has been closely tracking the deteriorating security situation across Afghanistan and officials had previously said all steps will be taken to ensure that Indian officials and nationals are not put in harm’s way. According to information provided by the government in Parliament last week, there are currently some 1,500 Indian nationals in Afghanistan. A majority of them are workers and professionals engaged in the hundreds of development projects being implemented by the Indian government. The presence of hundreds of terrorists from Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed in different parts of Afghanistan has also emerged as a key security concern for the Indian side. New Delhi has been working on plans to ensure the safety of diplomats and all Indian nationals in Afghanistan in view of what officials have described as a “fluid and dynamic” situation because of the fierce fighting across the country. In April last year, India shuttered its consulates in Herat and Jalalabad, ostensibly because of the spread of Covid-19, though some reports suggested security was a factor behind the decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-evacuate-officials-and-nationals-from-mazar-e-sharif-in-northern-afghanistan-101628586020724.html

The warship sailed to Saudi Arabia after conducting the “Zayed Talwar” drill with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) off the coast of Abu Dhabi on Saturday.India’s defence and military ties with Saudi Arabia received a major boost with Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane’s visit to Riyadh – the first such trip by an Indian service chief – last December.

India is proud to be home to the Asiatic Lion. On World Lion Day, I convey my greetings to all those passionate about lion conservation. It would make you happy that the last few years have seen a steady increase in India’s lion population,” PM Modi tweeted.World Lion Day is celebrated on August 10 of every year to raise awareness about lions and to mobilise support for their protection and conservation. According to the World Wide Fund for animals (WWF), even though a lion is often referred to as the “king of the jungle,” it actually only lives in grasslands and plains.When I was serving as Gujarat CM, I had the opportunity to work towards ensuring safe and secure habitats for the Gir Lions. A number of initiatives were taken which involved local communities and global best practices to ensure habitats are safe and tourism also gets a boost. pic.twitter.com/0VEGmh7YgjIndia is home to the majestic Asiatic Lion, who inhabit the protected territory of Sasan-Gir National Park. Read on to find out more about World Lion Day.History of World Lion DayThe initiative to protect the big cats started in 2013 and the first World Lion Day was celebrated that year. Since then, it has become a symbol in the fight to protect the majestic species.SignificanceAccording to the WWF, lions were once found throughout Africa, Asia and Europe but their numbers have dwindled over the years in these continents. These majestic cats that symbolise courage, ferocity, and power are threatened by extensive habitat loss.The last remaining population of the Asiatic Lions can be found in Gujarat's Gir National Park. These lions face significant threats of poaching. The Asiatic lion also faces the threat of genetic inbreeding arising from a single population inhabiting one place.WWF has recorded instances of lions dying after falling into unguarded wells around Gir. The animal welfare body has so far barricaded 180 wells with local partners and Gujarat Forest Department. It also credits the Gujarat government for providing subsidies to local farmers for barricading their wells in a bid to protect the lion population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-lion-day-2021-history-and-significance-101628569746141.html

India is President of UNSC for this month.According to UN diplomats, the EAM’s session on peacekeeping will be centered on securing the peacekeepers through a new application. India has a proud history of UN peacekeeping going all the way back to 1950s. It has contributed over 1,95,000 troops, the largest number from any country, participated in more than 49 missions and 168 Indian peacekeepers have lost their lives while serving the missions. India also provides eminent force commanders for key UN missions.However, the meeting on terrorism at the UNSC will be important in the context of rise of Taliban in Afghanistan and the umbrella it provides to global terrorist groups based in Pakistan. Since 1986, India has proposed a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism, but the said document has not been adopted as there is no unanimity on the definition of terrorism among member states.It is understood that Jaishankar will leave for UNSC on August 16 to chair the two meetings. He will return to India and then fly to Mexico, Guyana and Panama via New York for long pending bilateral visits two days later.Terrorism is antithesis to all that UN stands for with non-state actors targeting innocents to achieve political objectives either for themselves or for their political masters. India has been special target of Islamist terror groups based in Pakistan with thousands of innocents losing their lives all over the country particularly Jammu and Kashmir since the 1990s. Besides, countries in West Asia, Europe and the US have also been at the receiving end from terrorist and terror group like the so called Islamic State.The UNSC meeting on terrorism has come at a time when the ultra-conservative Islamists of Taliban are terrorising the innocents in a bid to grab political power in Kabul after the US-led coalition forces leave Afghanistan on August 31. The Sunni Pashtun group has covert support of neighbouring Pakistan in terms of cadre, weapons, fuel, food and medical supplies through trans border Khyber and Spin Boldak passes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-pm-modi-jaishankar-heads-for-unsc-with-terrorism-on-agenda-101628566857264.html

You must go.”On a request made by Flipkart’s lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi, the court gave the companies four weeks for appearing before the Director General (DG) of the CCI to join the investigation. Singhvi pointed out that the time to show up before the DG was expiring on Monday.“We see no ground to interfere with the impugned judgment of the high court. However, we grant four weeks for the parties to submit to the inquiry,” the court recorded in its order.Senior counsel Gopal Subramanium represented Amazon before the top court while solicitor general Tushar Mehta appeared for the CCI.When contacted, an Amazon spokesperson said: “Amazon has a high bar on compliance and we comply with all applicable laws. We will extend full cooperation to the CCI investigation”.A Flipkart spokesperson said while the company has not received the order yet, it respects the decision of the Supreme Court. “We are in compliance with applicable Indian laws and will cooperate with the investigation,” the spokesperson added.The case arises out of the CCI’s order last year, directing a probe against the two e-commerce firms into their practices such as discounting, exclusive tie-ups and private labels.Flipkart contended that the manner of questioning by the CCI is “invasive” in nature, citing its questionnaire that asked for a list of Flipkart’s top sellers, online discounts and pacts with smartphone makers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/probe-against-e-com-firms-to-go-on-sc-101628557949966.html

It was deferred for August 10 after Tejpal's lawyer Amit Desai told the high court that his instructing counsel Ankur Chawla had "bereavement" and some documents were yet to be furnished.Tejpal, the former editor of Tehelka magazine, is accused of raping a junior colleague inside the elevator of a five-star resort in Goa in 2013 during an event. The Goa police registered an FIR against him in November 2013 following which he was arrested. Tejpal was out on bail in May 2014.On May 21 this year, additional sessions judge Kshama Joshi acquitted Tejpal at a fast track court in Goa, saying that there wasn’t "enough evidence to warrant a conviction" giving him the benefit of doubt.Soon after the acquittal, the Goa government approached the Bombay high court to challenge the order.Tejpal faced the trial under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrongful confinement), 354 (assault or criminal force with intent to outrage modesty), 354-A (sexual harassment), 354-B (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe), 376(2)(f) (person in a position of authority over women, committing rape) and 376(2)(k) (rape by a person in a position of control).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-to-hear-appeal-against-tarun-tejpal-s-acquittal-in-rape-case-today-101628555906900.html

His wife was a member of the panchayat from the same village.Inspector general of police (IGP), Kashmir, Vijay Kumar said: “Two motorcycle-borne terrorists of the banned LeT outfit were involved in this barbaric terror incident.” “His PSO (personal security officer) has been suspended.”J&K Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha assured prompt action against the perpetrators. “I strongly condemn the brutal terrorist attack on the Sarpanch GH Rasool Dar and his wife Jawhara Banoo of Redwani Bala, Kulgam. This is an act of cowardice & perpetrators of violence will be brought to justice very soon. My deepest condolences to the bereaved family in this time of grief.”Union minister of state Jitendra Singh tweeted: “Extremely shaken by the dastardly terror killing of BJP leader & Sarpanch from Redwani, Kulgam,J&K,Sh Ghulam Rasool Dar & his wife. One feels short of words in condemning the cowardly attempt to discourage PM @narendramodi’s determined commitment to grassroot democracy in the Valley.”The incident was also condemned by leaders across the political spectrum in the Union territory.The BJP claimed that 19 of its leaders were killed in 2020 and 21 so far, by terrorists in various attacks across Kashmir.“He (Dar) was without security and lived in a rented accommodation. Like Dar, there are many BJP leaders who have no security,” BJP’s J&K spokesperson Altaf Thakur said.“Once again the cowardly Pakistani-sponsored terrorists have bled Kashmir by killing our Kisan Morcha leader and his wife...,” J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina told PTI.IGP Kumar, however, said that Dar was initially living in a secure hotel but decided to shift to a rented accommodation later.Former J&K chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti tweeted: “Extremely sorry to hear that the BJP District President and his wife have been shot dead by militants today.

On Sunday, the central agency raided 56 locations linked to the alleged JeI members across 14 districts in Jammu and Kashmir.The Centre banned the JeI for five years after the Pulwama attack, in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troopers were killed, under anti-terror laws on the grounds that it was “in close touch” with terror outfits and was likely to “escalate secessionist movement” in the region.“During the searches, various incriminating documents and electronic devices were seized from the premises of the suspects,” an NIA spokesperson said.PDP president Mehbooba Mufti termed the NIA raids a “self-goal” for the Centre. “NIA raids on Jamaat is emblematic of GOI (Government of India) waging a war against its so called ‘integral part’. Instead of fighting an ideology with a better idea it is crushing contrarian thought with an iron fist,” she tweeted.Terror plot foiled in J&K ahead of I-Day: ForcesSecurity forces in on Monday claimed to have foiled a terror plot, ahead of the 75th Independence Day, by recovering a large cache of arms and ammunitions including AK 47 assault rifles, hand grenades, detonators and pistols in Jammu’s Poonch.

10-08-2021||India||Marriages under special law can be registered virtually: SC||Law has to march with technology, said the Supreme Court on Monday as it asserted that a marriage under the Special Marriage Act can be registered through video-conferencing, without insisting on the physical presence of both spouses.A bench of justices Indira Banerjee and V Ramasubramanian said that letters of law cannot work in a manner that makes it impossible for people to follow them even when they desire to. “Special Marriage Act was enacted in 1954. The technology of computer and Internet has come much later. Therefore, the law has to march along with technology,” said the bench while dismissing an appeal filed by the Haryana government against an order of the Punjab and Haryana high court that allowed a couple to depose remotely under the special law.“Where there is difficulty, the letter of law cannot be so rigid that it makes it impossible for the parties to follow them. Moreover, the registration department is there to facilitate the parties and not to create obstruction or hurdles,” it observed.The court directed the Haryana government to comply with the high court order within 45 days and make sure the couple has a marriage certificate.The order has come in the wake of a couple expressing inability to show up before a marriage officer in Haryana’s Gurugram for getting their marriage registered under the Act.The man is an IT consultant based in the United Kingdom while the woman is a resident doctor in the United States. They got married in India in December 2019 and travelled back.They applied for registration of their marriage and the marriage officer sought their presence on April 3, 2020. However, due to Covid-19, all flights were cancelled and they could not travel to India. In August 2020, the couple moved a plea to let them process the registration through video-conferencing, but the marriage officer declined it.The couple then moved the Punjab and Haryana high court where the man pointed out that he couldn’t travel to the US to meet his wife without the marriage certificate. The plea asked for the woman to be exempted from physical appearance being on emergency Covid duty in US.A single-judge bench dismissed the request last December, holding that there is no provision in the law for marriage registration without the physical presence of the couple and two witnesses. This order was challenged before a two-judge bench of the high court, which ruled on March 9 that no provision of the SMA would be violated if the woman could be present through video-conferencing and the husband could be physically present with the witnesses. Haryana filed an appeal against the order in SC, saying that couple’s signatures were needed to register marriage.But the bench was unimpressed. “We do not deem it appropriate to interfere with the practical directions given by the high court by its impugned judgment and order. The special leave petition is, accordingly, dismissed. The order of the division bench shall be complied with within 45 days,” directed the bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/marriages-under-special-law-can-be-registered-virtually-sc-101628545749805.html
10-08-2021||India||SC pulls up Centre over ‘huge paucity of judges’||Citing massive vacancies of judges across the high courts in the country, the Supreme Court on Monday came down heavily on the Union government for bringing the “third pillar of democracy to a standstill” by not appointing judges and warned that the government’s administration will also come to a standstill if this attitude continues.“The government authority must realise that this is not how it will work. If you want to bring the judicial system to a standstill, your system will also come to a standstill...The line has been crossed by the government. You cannot let the third pillar of democracy come to a standstill,” rued a bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy.“There is a huge paucity of judges but you are not interested... If the judicial system is sought to be brought to a working halt, then your administrative system will also come to a working halt. It is time you (government) realise this,” it told additional solicitor general Madhvi Divan, who was appearing for the central government.As of August 1, a total of 455 posts of high court judges were lying vacant in the 25 high courts across the country against the total strength of 1,098.The vacancy translates to more than 41% of the total strength. High courts of Delhi, Allahabad, Calcutta, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Patna, Punjab and Haryana, Rajasthan and Telangana face shortages of more than one-third of their total judges’ strength.The bench was hearing an appeal filed by the Centre against an order of the Delhi high court in an anti-dumping duty matter when it remarked that the top court was “exasperated” by the “recalcitrant attitude of the government in not appointing high court judges for years together” despite final recommendations made by the collegium and timelines laid down through judicial orders for appointments.The comment came even as the ASG complained about the delay that may be caused before the expert body of anti-dumping because of the pendency of the matter before the high court. But the court shot down her request to interfere.“The government of India cannot take an argument that a judge is not able to hear cases expeditiously because the government itself does not appoint judges in the high courts. The Chief Justice of India (CJI) has last week talked about tribunals. The situation in the high court is also the same. You (government) have reduced the number of judges to almost half the sanctioned strength,” the bench told the ASG.On Friday, a bench led by CJI NV Ramana asked the Union government if it wants all tribunals wrapped up since they were unable to function due to a massive shortage of manpower.On Monday, the Justice Kaul-led bench trained its gun at the Centre.The bench told the law officer: “The scenario of inability to hear your petition early arises out of your inability to appoint judges. This is our view and grievance, both. You want to have a time-bound investigation but you cannot have it without time-bound scrutiny and that will require appointment of judges. The government does not take this point. You don’t make appointments after collegium recommends. We also gave you time-bound directions to appoint judges but you have not done that either.”The ASG, on her part, submitted that she was appearing only for one department (department of revenue) and that delay in deciding the present matter would impact the domestic industry which will not be in the public interest.At this, the court retorted: “It is also in the public interest that people get their adjudications done within a reasonable time and that they have enough judges to do it. But since you cannot do it, let the domestic industry realise that you cannot help them because you cannot appoint judges. You are therefore taking all the burden to the apex court. But we cannot ask the high courts to hear you expeditiously since you have not appointed judges and they are already overburdened.”While dismissing the petition by the Centre, the court recorded in its order: “The recommendations take months and years to reach the collegium and thereafter for months and years no decisions are taken post the collegium, the judicial institution of the high courts is manned by a number of judges where it will become almost impossible to have an early adjudication even on important issues.”“The real rub is in the fact that the high court does not find it feasible to accommodate such matters at an early date. This is the direct result of there being inadequacies of the number of high court judges including in the capital of the country where the Delhi high court is located,” said the court while noting that the Delhi high court is at present working with 50% of judges (30 of 60) and one more judge will retire in less than a week.The order added: “The government must realise that early adjudication of commercial disputes is the necessity for which there has to be an adequate number of judges which in turn would require them to follow the timelines.”Earlier in April, the Supreme Court had in a judgment set down 18 weeks as an outer time limit within which the Centre is expected to process the names for appointments of the high court judges, besides notifying appointments once the names are reiterated by its collegium.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-pulls-up-centre-over-huge-paucity-of-judges-101628545461337.html

V Sunil Kumar, the newly sworn in minister for Energy, Kannada and Culture on Monday requested people who come to congratulate him not to gift flowers and other items but present books instead. “I request that no one give me flowers and other items but instead give me Kannada books,” the minister had said, adding, “Read one paper a day and buy a book a month and if we do this, we can save Kannada.” Talking about the response he received from people, Kumar said, “People gave books and the chief minister gave me Kannada and the Culture department. “It is a good response and I had stated that I would donate them to the library. I received thousands of them and will give them to the library in Karkala (Udupi district) and any additional ones will be given to gram panchayats,” he added. In Karnataka, like the common practice in other states across India, there is a culture of felicitating ministers with expensive shawls, bouquets, figurines or statues among other items as a mark of respect. Karnataka attracts migrants--both white and blue—from across the country and the globe. However, there has been little done to promote the language which has been threatened by the excessive use of Hindi and the push to promote it as a national language which pro-Kannada activists and others have termed as an imposition and threat to the native tongue. Non-Hindi speaking states have protested the union’s push to make Hindi the common tongue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/give-me-books-not-flowers-k-taka-minister-s-push-to-promote-kannada-101628536757206.html
10-08-2021||India||Karnataka’s BJP govt moves forward with NEP implementation despite opposition||Bengaluru The Karnataka government on Monday said that the admission module under National Education Policy (NEP) will be launched on August 23 through the Unified University & College Management System.Dr.C.N.Ashwatha Narayana, the minister of higher education, said that he held a meeting with vice-chancellors of various universities with regard to preparation of a curriculum as per NEP. “ All the institutions including private, aided, and government colleges will be able to make use of the admission module that will be launched,” he said.He added that all the information regarding major subjects, minor subjects, core electives, open electives, vocational training among others will be provided in this module.“In all 32 subject-wise and faculty-wise committees have been constituted to prepare the curriculum as per the NEP principles. For the current year, the curriculum has to be prepared for 1st year of degree courses and 1st year of post-graduation courses before the commencement of classes by the 1st week of October,” he added.Karnataka wants to be the first to implement the contentious NEP, promoted by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led union government in July 2020 despite objection from the opposition parties and other activists.“The Central government has set a time limit of 15 years for the complete implementation of NEP. However, it has been decided in the meeting to completely implement it within 10 years in the state,” Naryana said.He said that the NEP will bring in flexibility in learning and teaching process by eliminating the rigidities and it will allow students to design their own courses based on their interest. “Further, it will also provide scope for blended learning by allowing the use of online content. This policy focuses on conceptual learning, critical thinking, and analytical thinking rather than rote learning,” he said.There are fears that the NEP will continue to impose Hindi on non-Hindi speaking states as the BJP believes in a common unifying language that threatens the diversity of the country.“The regional languages including Kannada will be strengthened by adopting this policy. For instance, in Karnataka, earlier, learning in degree courses was not mandatory. However, under this policy, learning Kannada is mandatory, and in addition to this students will have to learn one more language of their choice in the first two years of degree courses,” Narayana said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnatakas-bjp-govt-moves-forward-with-nep-implementation-despite-opposition-101628536697212.html
10-08-2021||India||K’taka minister defends controversial remark justifying violence against rivals||Karnataka rural development and panchayat raj minister K S Eshwarappa on Monday defended his statement encouraging Bharatiya Janata Party workers to “hit back with the same strength” if any party worker is harmed by any political adversary. However, Opposition Congress criticised the minister’s remarks and called for his dismissal from the cabinet.The minister made the controversial remarks on Sunday, while addressing party workers at an event held in his home district of Shivamogga. “Today, the BJP has grown the world over, and if a BJP worker is touched anywhere in any corner, the instruction is to hit back with the same stick. In the past, the decision was to stay calm at all costs... We have become very strong,” Eshwarappa said.Defending his statement on Monday, Eshwarappa told reporters “Do we have to be silent even if our women are raped? Our cows are stolen and killed, and our youth assaulted and killed -- you want us to remain silent?” At the Sunday meeting, the minister also told the party workers that there was a time when Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological mentor of the party, and BJP top leaders used to ask party workers “to stay calm at all costs”, but now the situation has changed. “... We had to be calm, irrespective of the situation and how much we were attacked. We did not have the strength.”Eshwarappa’s remarks drew sharp criticism from the Opposition Congress, which demanded that the Governor immediately sack him. “His (Eshwarappa’s) remarks are against the spirit of the Constitution. He has made such remarks to draw attention from the RSS because he didn’t get the deputy chief minister post,” said senior state Congress leader, VS Ugrappa. Afsar Kodipet, the spokesperson for the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), also echoed Congress’s stance and said that Eshwarappa must be removed from the cabinet immediately. “The Speaker must expel him from the Legislature, the chief minister must drop him from the Cabinet,” he said. State home minister Araga Jnanendra refused to comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-minister-defends-controversial-remark-justifying-violence-against-rivals-101628536637310.html
10-08-2021||India||Bommai dismisses any confusion over portfolio allocation||Bengaluru Dismissing any confusion over Cabinet formation and rumblings over portfolios, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Monday said that all issues will be resolved at the earliest. Since Bommai took over as chief minister from BS Yediyurappa, his two-week-old government have been facing dissent from sitting legislators, who were not accommodated in the Cabinet, and also from newly sworn-in ministers who have been demanding changes in portfolios. “There is no confusion (regarding portfolio allocation). Anand Singh (one of the disgruntled ministers) had come yesterday (and) I have spoken to him on several issues, he is satisfied. I will call him in a couple of days and speak to him once again. There is no confusion in any way,” Bommai said on Monday. The statements come even as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government in Karnataka seems to have become a divided house over the recently formed Cabinet and portfolio allocations. There are ministers who are dissatisfied with the allocations while a section of the BJP’s core legislators are fuming after being overlooked by the newly sworn in chief minister. The decision to make Bommai, who has been with the BJP just for 13 years now, as chief minister itself had stirred disgruntlement among core-BJP legislators who were overlooked for the top job and now sidelined for the Cabinet. N Nagaraj (MTB) and Anand Singh have openly aired their dissatisfaction while the likes of Satish Reddy, Arvind Bellad, SA Ramdass and several others have made the chief minister well aware of their protest. There are just four vacancies in the 34 member Cabinet and at least three times the aspirants, people aware of the developments said. Even B Sriramulu, who has been allocated transport and ST welfare ministry, said that he hoped the BJP high command would consider him for a better portfolio as he was considered to be in the race for at least the deputy chief minister’s post. “I am neither happy nor unhappy,” Sriramulu told TV9 news channel on Monday. He said that the BJP is a national party which decided to do away with the deputy chief minister post for which he was a strong contender. “Ours is a national party and I am not sure why this happened in the past but I am confident that if there is such a situation in the future, they will create an opportunity for me,” Sriramulu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bommai-dismisses-any-confusion-over-portfolio-allocation-101628536577203.html

The exams were conducted under the shadow of Covid-19 on July 19 and 22 were held on the ‘OMR sheet’ unlike the traditional way of writing exams on the answer sheets.The first paper held on July 19 was a combination of core subjects Maths, sciences and social studies -- in three hours while the second paper conducted on July 22 pertained to languages such as Kannada, English or Sanskrit.S Suresh Kumar, the former minister for primary and secondary education, had said that conducting the exams would be important as it is a crucial juncture in a child’s education and would help them choose their stream of choice in higher studies. Nagesh said that 128,931 students secured A+ grade (90 to 100 marks) which accounts for 16.52% while 250,317 students got A grade (80-89 marks) which accounts for 32.07%.

However, religious rituals in churches/ temples/ mosques/ places of worship will continue as usual with a limited number of people with strict adherence to Covid-19 protocols,” a notification from the office of the Special Relief Commissioner said.On Monday, the state reported 886 new Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours, a huge decline from the 12,852 cases reported in the peak of the second wave of Covid-19 in May. There have been 6601 deaths due to the viral disease so far in Odisha.Last year too, the state government had not allowed any congregation at puja pandals.The Odisha government said puja pandals would need to be covered on three sides while the 4th side would be covered in a way so as not to allow any public view of the idols. The size of the idols would be less than 4 feet and public address systems have been barred. There would be no immersion procession and the idols will be immersed in artificial ponds created by the local administration.“The persons present at the Puja Pandal/Mandap would have to follow all Covid-19 protocols of social distancing, masks, personal hygiene and sanitation issued by the government. The citizens are allowed to observe the said pujas/ festivals in their premises without causing any congregation at any place and maintaining all safety protocols, such as social distancing, wearing of masks, proper sanitisation, etc. For conducting puja in puja pandals/mandaps, the organizers have to apply to and obtain necessary permission from the district magistrate or any other officer authorised by him/her,” the SRC guidelines said.However, the state government allowed Ganesh Puja in educational institutions with participation of a limited number of students observing Covid-appropriate behaviour.The state government has also allowed opening of temples and religious institutions in Khordha, Cuttack, Puri, Sambalpur, Koraput and Jajpur districts amid Covid-19 protocols.

10-08-2021||India||Protests continue at K’taka borders over Covid-19 curbs||Interstate commuters from Kerala continued with their protests over travel restrictions imposed by the Karnataka government at the border areas on Monday. The Karnataka government on Saturday had made RT-PCR negative report mandatory for those entering the state from various entry points. The restrictions had sparked protests among a section of the population from Kerala, for whom Mangaluru is the closest city. Despite the protest, the Karnataka government has continued the restrictions as the number of cases in the border district of Dakshina Kannada are on the rise. For the residents of Kasaragod in Kerala, Mangaluru city in Dakshina Kannada is a lifeline. Even though Mangaluru and Kasaragod are on either side of a map, they are closely knit, say local residents. “Mangaluru is the closest city to Kasaragod. From anywhere in Kasaragod, Mangaluru is just 10-50 km away. At the same time, the closest city in Kerala, Kannur, is more than 100 km away,” said Prakash Manjeshwar, a resident of Manjeshwaram, in the northern tip of Kasargod. The district administration however claimed that Dakshina Kannada district had a 60% increase in Covid-19 cases in the past two weeks. On July 25, the district had reported 2,010 active cases, however, the number rose to 3,294 by August 7. Out of these cases, 2,376 were reported during the last week. The state reported 1,776 new cases on Monday, taking the active caseload to 23,316. Bengaluru accounted for 296 new infections, taking its active cases to 8,378. The only other state to have recorded cases in triple digits was Dakshina Kannada which recorded 273 cases taking the active cases in the district to 3321. As many as 30 fatalities were reported across the state on Monday, which took the state’s toll to 36,817.“Compared to other districts there is a rise in Covid cases in Dakshina Kannada district. Interstate travel is the main reason for it. We are not opposed to people traveling to Mangaluru for work, we are allowing them to enter by showing an RT-PCR test report that is one week old. We are also not stopping any medical emergency. We don’t want people coming to the city to visit malls and other non-essential activities,” said Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner K Rajendra, who said the restrictions will continue. The protesters also questioned the validity of the demand for RT-PCR tests for those who have been vaccinated. With Karnataka government imposing severe restrictions at borders, they argued that the Supreme Court has directed states not to interrupt interstate movement. “The central government has already directed that those who have taken two doses of vaccine should not be prevented from interstate movement. Hence, Karnataka chief minister Bommai should review his decision and allow people from Kerala, who have received both doses of vaccine, to enter Karnataka,” one of the protestors told the media. Meanwhile, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Monday said he has decided to visit all the border districts of the state that have reported a surge in Covid-19 cases and review the situation there in the days to come. “I will be traveling in Mysuru district today. I will have a discussion with officials on the Covid situation there. In the same way, I have decided to visit all the border districts, where there are more Covid cases,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protests-continue-at-k-taka-borders-over-covid-19-curbs-101628536279135.html
10-08-2021||India||SC issues notice on petition seeking clinical trial data of Covid-19 vaccines||The Supreme Court on Monday sought the response of the Centre on a petition seeking transparency of data on clinical trials conducted for Covid-19 vaccines. However, the Court cautiously avoided passing any order stalling compulsory vaccine mandates noting that the pandemic situation in the country was still grave and any order passed at this stage could lead to a bigger problem. The matter will be taken up after four weeks. The bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose said, “We will issue notice on the petition. But we don’t want that our notice should send a signal on safety of the vaccines.” The petition has been filed as a public interest litigation by Jacob Pulayil, a former member of the Government’s apex body on immunization - National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization. It has named Centre, Central Drugs Standards Control Organization represented through Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and vaccine manufacturers Bharat Biotech (Covaxin) and Serum Institute of India (Covishield) as respondents. The petition argued by advocate Prashant Bhushan demanded that the Government and the DCGI should provide segregated data for each of the phases of clinical trials undertaken with regard to the vaccines administered in India. Bhushan said though vaccination has not been made mandatory by the Government, compulsory vaccine mandates are being issued depriving persons of their livelihood and access to essential services for not being vaccinated. Bhushan sought an interim order staying such mandates. The bench said, “We cannot take responsibility of passing any order which can increase the number of casualties or endanger public health.” The judges appreciated the petitioner for raising a good legal point on personal autonomy of citizens and right to their livelihood vis-à-vis right to public health but did not lose sight of the “bigger picture”. “As it is, we are fighting with vaccine hesitancy. Almost 50 crore citizens in the country have already got their vaccine. The situation is so grave that we are still not out of the pandemic. Looking at this position, we cannot decide if any order passed by us can lead to a bigger problem,” the bench said. Before issuing notice, the Court raised its apprehensions that a notice by the Court could lead to more doubts in public mind about efficacy and safety of vaccines. “You know the ground situation. Vaccine hesitancy is coming from rural areas and not from the educated class in urban areas. Our apprehension is that a detailed enquiry into this issue will amount to throwing a spanner into what is already existing, leading to more doubts,” the bench observed. Bhushan submitted that never before has a universal vaccination programme in the country been given emergency use authorization without disclosing data on the approval process, clinical trials and post-vaccination effects. “This is a clear violation of the basic norms of scientific disclosures and the guidelines with respect to disclosure of clinical trial data, as laid down by the World Health Organization (WHO) and followed by the ICMR,” the petition said. Further, the petition quoted the Helsinki Declaration of 2013 on Ethical Principles for Medical Research involving Human Subject adopted by the World Medical Association which casts a duty on researchers to publicly disclose all negative, inconclusive and positive results of their research. Contrary to creating doubts, Bhushan said that interference by the Court will reassure citizens. The bench said that globally, this issue of compulsory vaccination without informed consent had been engaging the attention of courts across various jurisdictions. The judges cited a ruling by an Indiana court in the U.S which approved a vaccine mandate issued by Indiana University to its students. This ruling has been challenged before the Supreme Court of the United States. It also made reference to a recent European Union decision upholding Czech Republic’s decision on mandatory vaccination of children. Bhushan said, “This is not an anti-vaccine petition.” He referred to a 2011 decision passed by the top court in Aruna Shanbaugh matter where Court upheld the citizen’s right to refuse medical treatment as part of their right to live with dignity and make an informed choice. He cited examples of 16 countries which had banned the use of Astra-Zeneca vaccine (branded as Covishield in India)Bhushan said that circumstances warranting emergency approvals to vaccines cannot be a reason for trial data (that has been collected and on the basis for which approvals have been given), to be withheld from public scrutiny. He alleged suppression of data on Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) which was endangering more people to suffer the same fate. As per data maintained by AEFI Secretariat of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 492 severe and serious (including death) AEFI have been classified. The petition quoted a news report stating that as on March 29, a total of 180 deaths have been reported in the country following vaccination. In a lighter vein, the Court noted, “The country is fighting COVID vaccine shortage and now we are dealing with another dimension in this case.” Another bench of the Supreme Court is already examining the issue of vaccine preparedness in a suo moto petition where the Government had disclosed a comprehensive plan to vaccinate all citizens by this year end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-issues-notice-on-petition-seeking-clinical-trial-data-of-covid-19-vaccines-101628535197073.html
10-08-2021||India||Oppn leaders discuss 2024 poll strategy at dinner hosted by Sibal||Top Opposition leaders gathered at Congress member of parliament (MP) Kapil Sibal’s residence on Monday evening and informally discussed how they could work together ahead of the next general elections in 2024 to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), according to three people who attended the event.The leaders were called for a dinner a day after Sibal’s 73th birthday.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and leader Praful Patel, Biju Janata Dal (BJD) MP Pinaki Misra, Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders Derek O’Brien and Kalyan Banerjee, National Conference (NC) leader Omar Abdullah, Samajwadi Pary (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut, Left leaders Sitaram Yechury and D Raja, Shiromani Akali Dal’s Naresh Gujral, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s (DMK) Tiruchi Siva, and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad attended the event.At least 20 of the so-called “G-23” group of leaders, who wrote a letter to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi last year asking for an overhaul in the party organisation, were present at the dinner, as was former finance minister P Chidambaram.One person who attended the dinner said all leaders focused on things that the parties could work on together ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls and also spoke about the upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, scheduled in early 2022, as being the first challenge to the BJP.“We should aim for a one-on-one contest in 2024,’’ Pawar told the gathering, according to this person.The NCP chief backed an election strategy of fielding a united Opposition candidate to take on the BJP in a particular constituency, and cited the coalition government in Maharashtra as proof that Opposition forces could coalesce. “Who would have thought that the NCP, Congress and Sena can work together?’’ he said. Raut agreed, saying Maharashtra had been able to show how new experiements can work in alliances.O’Brien talked about following the example of West Bengal, where the TMC managed to defeat the BJP after a acrimonious, high-voltage campaign. “Today is the 100th day since Mamata Banerjee defeated the BJP,’’ he said, according to a second person present at the event.Yechury pointed out to all the attendees that Sibal’s home at 8, Teen Murti Lane was where former Communist Party of India(Marxist) leader Harkishan Singh Surjeet lived.Surjeet was known as one of the principal architects of the United Front government in the 90s and also for his role in bringing together the Congress and Left together to form the United Progressive Alliance, which formed the government in 2004.“This is where it all happened so I think it is an auspicious beginning,’’ said Yechury.A surprise inclusion was that of Pinaki Misra, who told the gathering that the BJD was fighting the BJP in Odisha, according to a third person who attended the event.A member of the G-23 group who didn’t want to be identified said many Opposition leaders commended them. Congress MP and one of the signatories to the letter to Gandhi, Manish Tewari, talked about the need for the Opposition to come together to “keep the idea of India alive’’, said the third person quoted above.Sibal explained how the G 23’s push was to ensure that these ideas kept the “ball rolling’’ on democracy. “’If you can strengthen the Congress, then you’ll be strengthening the entire Opposition.’’ Abdullah told Sibal, according to this person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-leaders-discuss-2024-poll-strategy-at-dinner-hosted-bysibal-101628535017090.html
10-08-2021||India||HC nod should be made must to withdraw cases against MLAs: Report||State governments should be allowed to withdraw cases against former or sitting legislators only after the relevant high court’s approval, a report has proposed to the Supreme Court.The proposal was made in a petition relating to fast-tracking of criminal trials against sitting and former Members of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies (MPs/MLAs) by court-appointed amicus curiae senior advocate Vijay Hansaria.The report by Hansaria noted four instances wherein the state governments had issued orders to end criminal cases against politicians by using its power under section 321 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). This provision allows a public prosecutor in charge of a case to move a request before the trial judge for permission to withdraw further prosecution of a case.If the trial judge accepts the request for withdrawal of prosecution, the accused stands discharged (if charges not framed) or acquitted in respect of that particular offence(s).“This court may be pleased to direct that no prosecution against a Member of Parliament and/or Legislative Assembly/Council (both sitting and former) shall be withdrawn without leave of the High Court,” Hansaria said.The senior advocate also cited a July 28 judgment of the top court which laid down the principles required for entertaining a request for withdrawal of prosecution under section 321 CrPC, saying that these principles be considered by the high court while considering requests for withdrawal of prosecution.The July 28 judgment came on an appeal filed by Kerala government, seeking permission to withdraw criminal cases against six of its legislators (four former and two sitting) for alleged acts of vandalism inside the Assembly during budget presentation in March 2015.Turning down the state’s request, the court noted that the decision to withdraw the cases must subserve the larger interest of administration of justice. It further stated that the court, before allowing such requests, should scrutinise the nature and gravity of offence and its impact upon public life, especially in matters involving public funds and the discharge of a public trust.The amicus curiae, in his report, also highlighted recent examples from four states – Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Maharashtra – where orders under section 321 CrPC were issued to dismiss various cases.In August last year, the Karnataka government had ordered the withdrawal of 61 criminal cases, many of which were filed against sitting legislators of the state assembly.Similarly, the Uttar Pradesh government last year chose to withdraw the case against political leader Sadhvi Prachi and three sitting MLAs – Sangeet Som, Suresh Rana and Kapil Dev – for their alleged inflammatory statements during the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots. The amicus cited news reports to show that the withdrawal of prosecution was applicable to 76 criminal cases related to the riots.Another report from Maharashtra indicated that the state government had decided in December last year to withdraw political cases against activists registered prior to December 31, 2019. This trend was spotted in Uttarakhand too where the high court informed the amicus that in September 2020, the state government had sought withdrawal of prosecution against sitting MLA Rajkumar Thukral in an alleged murder case.In June this year, the Andhra Pradesh High Court took suo moto cognizance of 11 separate orders passed by various magistrates allowing withdrawal of prosecution in criminal cases pending against chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. The suo motu petition is still pending before the high court. This case, however, was not cited by the amicus in his report.“Withdrawn from prosecution u/s 321 CrPC is permissible in public interest and cannot be done for political considerations. Such application can be made in good faith, in the interest of public policy and justice and not to thwart or stifle the process of law,” Hansaria said.Hansaria requested the top court to ensure that the principles laid down in the Kerala case be applied by high courts to examine cases under section 321 of CrPC involving sitting and former legislators.The case to fast-track trials against legislators is pending in the Supreme Court since 2016 in a PIL filed by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay.Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Hansaria said, the past one year saw no effective trial in cases against politicians. He further informed the court that the Centre had not supplied data on pending cases with regard to offences tried by the Central Bureau of Investigation, Enforcement Directorate among other central agencies against sitting/former legislators.This information was first sought by the court on September 16, 2020, and since then on two occasions, the Centre sought time.Hansaria requested the court to direct the Centre to inform the stage of investigation in these cases, share the status of grant of sanctions for prosecution, expected time for completion of the investigation and reasons for delay in the same before the next date of hearing.Hansaria said that based on periodic reports submitted by high courts, the number of pending cases against sitting and former legislators as of September 2020 was 4,859.In December 2018, this number stood at 4,122 and gradually increased to 4,222 by March 2020.Last week, Hansaria had requested the bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana to take up the matter as no hearing in this case has taken place since November last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-nod-should-be-made-must-to-withdraw-cases-against-mlas-report-101628534777140.html
10-08-2021||India||Munger girl killed in ‘human sacrifice ritual’, 4 held: Police||An eight-year-old girl, whose mutilated body was found on the banks of the Ganga in Bihar’s Munger district on August 5, was killed allegedly as part of a human sacrifice ritual devised by a local mystic, police said on Monday.The victim’s parents rejected the allegation and said that their daughter was raped and killed. An autopsy has ruled out rape. Police have arrested four people and charged them with kidnapping (Section 363 of the IPC) and murder (Section 302) .Munger superintendent of police (SP) JJ Reddy told reporters that Parvez Alam, who claims to be a tantric, told local villager Dilip Kumar Choudhary that he needed to sacrifice a girl to avert the possibility of his pregnant wife’s miscarriage.Choudhury, who was present at the press conference and is one of the four accused, said he had four children -- two sons and two daughters -- but wanted a fifth. He said he got in touch with Alam, a resident of Khagaria district.Alam, Choudhury claimed, asked for the eye of 10-year-old boy or a girl so that he could prepare an amulet for the woman “consecrated” with the blood and eyes of a minor. “We committed the crime on the instigation of Alam,” said the main accused, Dilip to police.The other two arrested accused people are Tanvir Alam and Dasrath Kumar who allegedly were accomplices of Alam and Choudhury, police said.The girl, a student of class 3, went missing on the evening of August 4 and her mutilated body was found on the banks of Ganga the next day.According to police, Choudhary, Tanvir and Dasrath assembled near a brick kiln and caught the girl when she was returning home after delivering lunch to her father, who is a fisherman.A complaint was lodged on August 4 evening when she did not reach home. Her body was found the next morning.The three dragged her inside the brick kiln and thrashed her before strangulating her and gouging her right eye. Her body also bore injury marks, giving rise to initial suspicion that she was raped, police said.The SP said police recovered bloodstained cloth and a pendant and sent it for forensic examination. “The medical board report did not confirm rape,” said Reddy.The police earlier detained 12 people in the case but all were freed after questioning. Alam was arrested from his home at Khagaria after Dilip Choudhary confessed to his crime.The girl’s mother and father trashed the police theory, claiming their child was raped before being killed.. “Police have cooked up a story. We need justice,” the father said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/munger-girl-killed-in-human-sacrifice-ritual-4-held-police-101628534480774.html
10-08-2021||India||Kerala landslide survivors move HC for better land||A year after a massive landslide decimated a colony of tea plantation workers in Pettimudi in Idukki district, killing 70 persons, relatives of the deceased on Monday moved the Kerala high court with a plea to allot land and houses in live-able areas. In their plea, they said some of the allotted land and houses were in remote areas without motor-able roads and they need a proper dwelling, which ensures proper commuting and hassle-free life. The high court later sent notices to the state government and Kannan Devan Hill Plantation (KDHP). Most of these employees were working with the KDHP when the tragedy occurred. Survivors want the government to take over “excess land” occupied by the KDHP and distribute them to the landless. After the mishap, the state government announced that houses will be built for the affected under the Life Mission project. But many inhabitants said most of the houses were situated in inhospitable locations and they find it difficult to lead a normal life. Tragedy struck Pettimudi on the night of August 6 last year after a portion of the hill came down due to incessant rain, destroying a settlement of tea workers, and people came to know about the mishap only the next day. Some of the bodies were recovered 14 km away from the landslide site. Only 64 bodies were recovered, and last week a special order was issued by the government certifying that missing were also dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-landslide-survivors-move-hc-for-better-land-101628534478280.html
10-08-2021||India||Online classes trigger many health issues, says Kerala education minister||Online classes trigger several health problems, with about 36 per cent of students reporting neck pain and another 28 per cent complaining of eye ailment, Kerala education minister V Sivankutty said in the state assembly on Monday, suggesting that regular classes need to commence at the earliest. Sivankutty read the statement from a survey conducted by the state council of education research and training, which further stated that “about 22% have anxiety and stress”. Children in schools have been forced to opt for online classes since April 2020, when the first Covid lockdown was announced in the country. After that, while secondary and higher secondary classes have opened in some states for a short duration, the schools till upper primary level have remained shut in most of the states. Kerala is not an exception. Sivankutty said the government is waiting for the Centre’s directive to open schools, and a final decision will be taken soon. It is planning to open schools for senior students, but the high volume of virus cases in the state leaves it in a quandary. Neighbouring states Tamil Nadu and Karnataka have already announced their plan to open educational institutions in a structured manner. “We can’t continue online classes forever. Our study shows students suffer from some ailment or the other due to online classes. We have to go back to the old system as soon as possible,” he said in the assembly. The minister said to reduce Covid-related mental stress students will be given free counselling. Some children lost their parents and relatives in the pandemic and turned orphans. The state had announced several plans to look after them. “We have to make parents also aware of the inherent dangers of overuse of the internet. We will give training to them also. Many non-government bodies have come forward,” he said. “Schools will reopen in different phases. We have to inoculate students before opening. We will ensure a smooth opening after meeting all norms,” he said. Many experts said strict adult guidance or monitoring is needed for internet use by younger children, and parents will have to lay down ground rules for the usage to avoid overexposure and exploitation. Some parents also complained that after each class, schools often take a long break keeping children glued to the screen for a long. “Strict parental guidance needed for younger children. They have to ensure a balance between the use of gadgets and avoiding their harmful effects,” said P Niveditha, a teacher, adding that the parents will have to keep a vigil. “Digital world opens a new vista for students. But they will have to be careful. Children with behavioural issues can spin into gadget addiction fast,” said child psychologist Dr T V Anil Kumar. He said online classes will leave a spectre of screen addiction in many children. Many students also admitted that online classes can’t be compared to traditional classes, which help them to embrace many qualities. Besides this, another danger lurks the digital classes, complained teachers and parents. Some anti-social elements have started hacking and posting vulgar posts in groups meant for online classes. At least 51 such complaints surfaced in the state in the last three months, and cybersecurity experts said the majority of such posts are created outside the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/online-classes-trigger-many-health-issues-says-kerala-education-minister-101628534477086.html
10-08-2021||India||Nitish Kumar reiterates demand for caste-census, hints Centre needs to take a call||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday once again reiterated his demand for caste-based census, saying it would be in the best interest of the country and it was for the Centre to take a call on the matter. “I have always been advocating it for a long time. My letter has also reached the Prime Minister on August 4 in this regard. We want a caste-based census. In Bihar, both the Houses had passed a resolution for it in 2020 also; the Legislative Assembly passed a resolution again. This will benefit all. There should be caste-based census at least once to get a hang of the real status of various castes, which will help in making development plans,” he said, after his weekly ‘Janata ki durbar mein mukhyamantri’ programme to listen to people’s problems directly and address them. The CM said figures for all the castes would help everyone. “We have been demanding it since 1990. It is not a political issue. It is a social issue. But it is for the Centre to decide. If the PM gives time, we will also meet him. Other states are also discussing it. Our MPs also wanted to meet PM, but they were asked to meet the home minister and they met him and presented their views,” he added. Kumar said that the caste-based census was an issue which only the Centre could decide. “If we have to do it, it will be counting, not census to get information. Census is done only at the national level. Some states have done it at their level. Karnataka did it. If we have to decide on caste census in Bihar, we will decide it later on after discussing the matter. But we want it to be done at the national level so that it happens across the country,” he added. The CM said it was last done in 1931 and all the people were for it, as it would help in inclusive development. “Some sections are educationally backward; there are other kinds of backwardness. It will be in the interest of the country,” he added. As per projections from figures of 1931 Census for specific Hindu castes and the 1961 Census for all others, backward castes consisted of 51.3% of the population in the state. However, many political parties feel that the numbers might have changed, and a fresh caste-based census is the need of the hour. In February this year also, Kumar had batted for a caste-based census, but now his statements have assumed greater significance, as the Opposition is trying to make it a rallying point to corner the BJP ahead of the crucial UP elections. In 2017, the Centre had set up the Justice Rohini Commission, which favoured sub-categorisation of reservation for other backward castes (OBCs) in the government sector by splitting 27% quota into different categories of OBC for equitable distribution of benefits among different sub-castes. After several extensions, it could submit its report, dividing 2633 OBC sub-castes in the central list into four sub-categories with 2%, 6%, 9% and 10% quota to add up to 27%. Before that, in 2011, socio-economic and caste census was done in 2011, though caste data could never be made public due to several discrepancies. Till date, Census only makes the count of population based on religion and SC/ST population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitish-kumar-reiterates-demand-for-caste-census-hints-centre-needs-to-take-a-call-101628534357002.html
10-08-2021||India||Now foreigners can also get Covid-19 vaccine in India: Health ministry||Foreign nationals residing in India can now receive the Covid-19 vaccine by registering themselves on the CoWin platform, the Union health ministry announced on Monday.Like other eligible beneficiaries, the foreign nationals can book a slot via the portal and use their passport as a document to verify their identity for the registration process, it added.“Together We Fight, Together We Win. Govt has now allowed foreign nationals residing in India to register on CoWin portal and take #COVID19 vaccine. This will ensure overall safety from the transmission of the virus,” the office of Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said.Providing more details, a statement from the health ministry read: “In a landmark initiative to ensure safety from Covid-19, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has taken a decision to allow foreign nationals residing in India to get registered on CoWin portal to take Covid-19 vaccine. They can use their passport as identity document for the purpose of registration on CoWIN portal. Once they are registered on this portal, they will get a slot for vaccination.”“A significant number of foreign nationals are living in India, especially in large metropolitan areas. In these areas, the potential of spread of Covid-19 is high due to higher population density. To counter any possibility of such occurrence, it is important to vaccinate all eligible persons,” the ministry statement added.According to the ministry, the latest initiative will ensure the safety of foreign nationals residing in the country. It will also bring down the possibilities of transmission of infection from unvaccinated persons in India. It will further ensure overall safety from further transmission of Covid-19 virus, the government said.“As it has been said that no one is safe until everyone is safe, so the government is also ensuring that everyone in the country is able to receive the Covid-19 vaccine shot. This is an attempt in that direction,” a senior central government official aware of the matter said, wishing not to be named.The vaccination drive in the country began on January 16 this year by covering all eligible healthcare workers and frontline workers in the first phase.The drive was gradually extended to citizens above 60 years of age and those above 45 years of age suffering from 20-specified co-morbidities from March 1 as part of second phase.On May 1, the government opened the drive to those who were 18 years and above as part of a liberalised and accelerated phase 3 strategy of Covid-19 vaccination in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-foreigners-can-also-get-covid-vaccine-in-india-health-ministry-101628534180288.html
10-08-2021||India||Parliament passes 6 bills amid protests||NEW DELHI: The last week of Parliament’s monsoon session started with fresh momentum in the government’s legislative agenda on Monday. Both House passed three bills each, ignoring protests and objections of the Opposition.In the Rajya Sabha, a motion to refer bills to select committees was defeated, some Opposition members staged a walkout in protest against the last-minute inclusion of bills in the day’s agenda -- which gives them little time to prepare.The government agreed to debate farm issues in the Rajya Sabha—one of the key demands by the Opposition.But Opposition parties will meet on Tuesday morning to take a call on participation as they’re insisting on a debate on the Pegasus snooping row before any other issue. The quick pace of the passage of bills has also raised doubts on whether the government wants to end the session earlier than scheduled.Late on Monday, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said the Centre’s scheduled discussion on ‘The agricultural problems and solutions’ has “nothing to do with my notice given on July 23rd on the ongoing farmers’ agitation”, where he had sought a discussion in Parliament over the issue.The Tribunal Reforms Bill was passed after a division on the motion to refer it to a select committee was defeated with 79 votes against it and 44 in favour. The Congress, Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) staged a walkout after the bill was passed, protesting the last-minute inclusion of key bills in the supplementary list of business.Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, earlier lashed out at the government over the inclusion of the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill in the supplementary list of business, alleging that it was the government’s way of ensuring the passage of bills.In the Lok Sabha, the Congress, TMC and some other Opposition parties protested against the introduction of two bills-- The National Commission for Homoeopathy (Amendment) Bill, and The National Commission for Indian System of Medicine (Amendment) Bill, 2021—replacing ordinances.Congress leader Manish Tewari objected to the introduction of the bill on homeopathy and said, “The manner in which the legislative business is being conducted in this House is in violation of Article 107 of the Constitution. It is in violation of Rules 74 and 76 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha.”TMC’s Saugata Ray alleged, “It will distort the homoeopathy profession,” and demanded a division or voting.Congress leader Adhir Chowdhury also objected to the bill on Indian system of medicine as it was brought in “a brazen manner” and underlined that “for past few days, we have been demanding the discussion on Pegasus.”The Lok Sabha passed The Limited Liability Partnership (Amendment) Bill, The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) (Amendment) Bill, and The Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Bill, 2021.The Rajya Sabha cleared Tribunal Reforms Bill, 2021, the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021 and the Central Universities (Amendment) Bill, 2021.Both Houses lauded Indian Olympians, including gold medalist Neeraj Chopra. Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu described it as “the first moment of national awakening in sports” and said “Indian athletes lifted the nation out of the mood of desperation, despondency, dejection and disbelief that prevailed for long due to poor performance in Olympics every four years and heralding an era of confidence and hope.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-passes-6-bills-amid-protests-101628533998716.html
10-08-2021||India||Imperative for Centre to act on task force’s proposal on oxygen supply: SC||The Supreme Court on Monday said that it was “imperative” for the Centre to act on the recommendations given by a 12-member National Task Force on oxygen allocation to states and Union territories and directed the government to file an action taken report within two weeks.The bench of Justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah, which had gone through the recommendations of the Task Force, asked the Centre on Monday about the progress on implementing them. “The Task Force consists of experts and senior doctors across the country. It is imperative for the Centre to take steps and ensure that their recommendations are duly implemented.”The report of the National Task Force (NTF), constituted by the top court in May this year, was submitted in June and included proposals for building strategic oxygen reserves to tide over a possible third wave of Covid-19 infections.Additional solicitor general (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati, who appeared for the Centre, informed the top court that the central government will file its action taken report before the top court.The bench posted the matter for hearing after two weeks along with a related suo motu petition on Covid-19 preparedness.The bench further directed the Centre to supply its report to the two amici curiae - senior advocates Jaideep Gupta and Meenakshi Arora, who are assisting the court in passing effective directions. The bench asked the two senior lawyers to prepare a note indicating the way forward to meet the exigencies of the situation, should there be a third wave of cases.The top court was hearing a plea by the Centre against a Delhi high court order initiating contempt proceedings against central government officials for not complying with a ruling to supply 700 MT of liquid medical oxygen for Covid-19 patients in the national capital at the peak of the second wave in late April. On May 5, the top court stayed the contempt proceedings.The NTF report made crucial recommendations on allocation and supply, prescribing a formula of 1.5 metric ton (MT) liquid medical oxygen for a 100-bed hospital with 25 intensive care unit (ICU) beds a day. “Such a formula will be a part of a dynamic, evolving process and open to modification and consultation with states as the situation evolves,” the Task Force stated in its report.For allocation of oxygen, the Task Force recommended taking into account active Covid-19 caseload in respective a region along with the doubling rate. By applying this standard, the requirement could be addressed for future demand as well, the report said.Akin to petroleum reserves, the expert panel said the Centre must come out with a plan for strategic oxygen reserves to cover consumption for two-three weeks.It also proposed that states and UTs should develop a mechanism to predict daily and weekly inventory of oxygen and send the information to an Oxygen War Room maintained by the Centre. The report emphasised that audit of oxygen usage by hospitals should be mandatory and required oxygen committees to be set up at state level to ensure a buffer of at least six oxygen cylinders in rural areas to make up for any delay in arranging last-minute demand for oxygen in remote areas.In addition to the NTF report, a sub-group on oxygen allocation and usage focusing on Delhi also submitted its interim report to the Court in June this year. Though the final report of the sub-committee, headed by AIIMS director Randeep Guleria is awaited, the findings in the draft showed “gross discrepancy” in recording the requirement of medical oxygen by 183 hospitals in Delhi. The report said that a demand of 1,140 MT was made as against the actual requirement of 209 MT.The report relied on responses received from Delhi government, a study by Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO) and data provided by 183 city hospitals to show that on May 12, actual consumption of oxygen was shown to be 1,140 MT. This exaggeration was denied by Delhi government. Later, the sub-group chairman clarified that the controversy was unnecessary as requirement of medical oxygen is dynamic in nature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imperative-for-centre-to-act-on-task-force-s-proposal-on-oxygen-supply-sc-101628533942787.html
10-08-2021||India||SC seeks govt’s reply on Covid-19 vaccine trials data plea||The Supreme Court on Monday sought the Centre’s response on a petition seeking transparency of data on clinical trials conducted for Covid-19 vaccines even as it avoided passing any order that could add to vaccine hesitancy, noting the still grave pandemic situation in the country.A bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose said, “We will issue notice on the petition. But we don’t want that our notice should send a signal on (the) safety of the vaccines.”The petition has been filed by Jacob Pulayil, a former member of the government’s apex body on immunisation, National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization, and is being argued by advocate Prashant Bhushan. It has named the Centre, Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation represented through Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and vaccine manufacturers Bharat Biotech (Covaxin) and Serum Institute of India (Covishield) as respondents.The petition has demanded that the government and DCGI provide segregated data for each of the phases of the clinical trials. Bhushan said though vaccination has not been made mandatory by the government, people are being deprived of their livelihood and access to essential services for not being vaccinated. Bhushan sought an interim stay on such mandates.The bench said, “We cannot take responsibility for passing any order which can increase the number of casualties or endanger public health.” The judges appreciated the petitioner for raising a good legal point on the personal autonomy of citizens and the right to their livelihood vis-à-vis their right to public health, but they did not lose sight of the “bigger picture”.“As it is, we are fighting with vaccine hesitancy. The situation is so grave that we are still not out of the pandemic. Looking at this position, we cannot decide if any order passed by us can lead to a bigger problem,” the bench said. Till Monday night, India has fully vaccinated 513, 914,567 people.Before issuing the notice, the court raised its apprehensions that a notice could lead to more doubts in people’s minds about the efficacy of vaccines.“You know the ground situation. Vaccine hesitancy is coming from rural areas and not from the educated class in urban areas. Our apprehension is that a detailed enquiry into this issue will amount to throwing a spanner into what is already existing, leading to more doubts,” the bench observed.Bhushan submitted that never before has a universal vaccination programme in the country been given emergency use authorisation without disclosing data on the approval process, clinical trials and post-vaccination effects. “This is a clear violation of the basic norms of scientific disclosures and the guidelines with respect to disclosure of clinical trial data, as laid down by the World Health Organization and followed by the ICMR,” the petition said.Further, the petition quoted the Helsinki Declaration of 2013 on Ethical Principles for Medical Research involving human subject adopted by the World Medical Association which casts a duty on researchers to publicly disclose all negative, inconclusive and positive results of their research. Contrary to creating doubts, Bhushan said that interference by the court will reassure citizens.The bench said that globally, this issue of compulsory vaccination without informed consent has been engaging the attention of courts across various jurisdictions. The judges cited a ruling by an Indiana court in the US that approved a vaccine mandate issued by Indiana University to its students. This ruling has been challenged before the Supreme Court of the United States. It also referred to a recent European Union decision upholding the Czech Republic’s decision on mandatory vaccination of children.Bhushan said, “This is not an anti-vaccine petition.” He referred to a 2011 decision passed by the top court in Aruna Shanbaugh matter where the court upheld citizens’ right to refuse medical treatment as part of their right to live with dignity and make an informed choice. He cited examples of 16 countries that had banned the use of Astra-Zeneca vaccine (branded Covishield in India).Bhushan said that circumstances warranting emergency approvals to vaccines cannot be a reason for trial data to be withheld from public scrutiny. He alleged that data on Adverse Events Following Immunization was being suppressed, endangering more lives.The court said it would hear the matter again after four weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-govt-s-reply-on-vaccine-trials-data-plea-101628533817713.html
10-08-2021||India||Farmers to decide India’s future: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday interacted with farmers from various parts of the country at a virtual event held to disburse about ₹19,500 crore to over 90.7 million farmers under the cash transfer scheme, PM-KISAN. There he asked growers to collectivise and shift towards scarce commodities such as edible oils.The PM talked to farmers selected to converse with him from states such as Uttar Pradesh, Manipur and Jammu and Kashmir, who shared success stories in the agriculture sector, even as farm unions from many states continued their protests of three agricultural laws enacted by his government.With the latest instalment, the government has so far transferred nine instalments amounting to ₹1.57 lakh crore to farmer families under PM-KISAN (Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi). Under the scheme, an annual direct cash transfer of ₹6,000 is provided to farmers, which is directly deposited into their registered bank accounts. The amount is paid in three equal instalments of ₹2,000 each paid every four months.“I am grateful for the saffron park. This has doubled my income from saffron in 2021. We have got new technology and market linkages,” said Abdul Jaleel, a saffron grower from Kashmir.The Prime Minister also talked about the role of farmers in the country’s future. “Where do we want to see India in the coming 25 years? When the country will complete 100 years of Independence, what will be the state of the country? This will be decided by the farmers of this country,” he said.Modi said his government had undertaken the “largest-ever purchases” of wheat and rice from farmers at minimum support prices. The government had purchased ₹1.7 lakh crore worth of rice from paddy growers and paid about ₹85,000 crore to wheat farmers.Referring to the forthcoming 75th anniversary of India’s Independence, Modi said: “Apart from being an occasion of pride, it is also an opportunity for new resolutions. We have to take this opportunity to decide where we want to see India in the coming 25 years”.“Agricultural practices have to change according to changing times. There is a huge demand for millets and farmers, especially small farmers, should grow them to get good value.”The PM said while fertiliser prices have doubled, his government shielded farmers from inflation. “We made quick arrangement to increase the fertiliser subsidy by ₹12,000 crore,” he said, adding the government has ensured uninterrupted supply of seeds, fertilisers and access to markets.Modi also announced the launch of a new initiative called National Edible Oil Mission-Oil Palm to achieve self-reliance in edible oils, two-thirds of which India imports to meet its domestic needs. “Today, when the country is remembering the Quit India Movement, on this historic day, this resolve fills us with new energy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-to-decide-india-s-future-pm-101628533756927.html
10-08-2021||India||SC asks Jharkhand HC to track CBI probe into judge’s death||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is yet to ascertain if there was any foul play in the death of additional district and sessions judge Uttam Anand, who was fatally knocked down by a vehicle on July 28 in Jharkhand’s Dhanbad.The Supreme Court on Monday noted that the investigating agency has not made any progress on the reason or motive behind the hit-and-run incident that claimed Anand’s life.“There is nothing in your sealed cover. We want something concrete. Arrest and seizing of vehicles were done by the state. You (CBI) have not indicated anything about intention or motive or any reason,” a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana told solicitor general Tushar Mehta.Mehta was representing the CBI in the public interest litigation registered by the court on its own over the death of the judicial officer in suspicious circumstances. The S-G replied that the interrogation of the two arrested persons was on and that any disclosure about the ongoing investigation may impact the probe.At this, the bench, which also included justices Vineet Saran and Surya Kant, said that the agency should submit weekly status reports before the Jharkhand high court that will henceforth monitor the CBI’s investigation.“We will keep the matter pending here and we will request the chief justice of the high court to examine your reports. Let the high court monitor your progress on a weekly basis,” it told the S-G.The court then recorded in its order: “Taking into account the gravity of the matter, we deem it appropriate to direct the CBI to file a report before the high court of Jharkhand every week and we further request the chief justice of the high court to monitor the investigation.”Apart from the specific instance of Dhanbad’s judge, the top court underlined that registration of the suo motu (on its own motion) case intends to resolve the alarming situation in the country where judicial officers and lawyers are being pressurised and intimidated by threats of violence or actual violence.“There is, therefore, an institutional need to create an environment where judicial officers feel safe and secure,” said the bench in its order as it tagged the suo motu case with a public interest litigation of 2019 which pertained to the security of judicial officers.Advocate Karunakar Mahalik had filed the PIL seeking a specialised force for security to all courts, judges, lawyers, litigants and witnesses in the country. In December 2019, the court had issued notices to the Union government and all the states. On Monday, the bench asked the Centre and states to put in their replies as soon as possible.Judges’ security had drawn the bench’s concerns on Friday last week too when it lamented that Intelligence Bureau (IB) and CBI “are not helping the judiciary at all. CJI Ramana rued that judges are not on priority for the investigating agencies and that their complaints are not heeded despite specialised body like the CBI getting roped in.“In one or two places, the court ordered a CBI inquiry. I am very sorry to say that the CBI has done nothing in more than one year. At one place, I know, the CBI has done nothing. I think we have expected some changes in CBI’s attitude. But there is no change in the attitude of the CBI. I am sorry to observe this but this is the situation,” the CJI had told attorney general KK Venugopal, who was called by the bench for assistance.On July 30, the bench had emphasised that it is the State’s obligation to protect judges to ensure they can discharge their duties fearlessly as it took suo motu cognisance of Anand’s death. A day later, the Jharkhand government recommended the CBI probe into the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-asks-jharkhand-hc-to-track-cbi-probe-into-judge-s-death-101628533698546.html
10-08-2021||India||BJP plans outreach programmes for new ministers||Over the next couple of days, Bharatiya Janata Party president J P Nadda will brainstorm with his party colleagues and state leaders to put together a major outreach programme for the 43 new ministers in the Narendra Modi government, said people aware of the details.Other than junior Jal Shakti minister Bisheshwar Tudu, who is in hospital due to Covid-19, all other new faces in the Union council of ministers will go on a three-day outreach programme to their constituencies and nearby areas to underline how the government has focussed on economically deprived groups like other backward castes (OBCs) and far-flung regions in this cabinet reshuffle.“All 40 new faces will spend three days and two nights at least in their areas. If they are Lok Sabha MPs, they will cover two other constituencies other than their own,” said a BJP office-bearer involved in the planning, requesting anonymity. “Some of the ministers will head out on August 16, after Independence Day, while cabinet ministers will go after the cabinet meeting on August 18.’’Called the Jan Ashirwad Rally, the three-day events are being carefully curated so that they underline the social message sent out by last month’s cabinet expansion that expanded the council of ministers to 77. There were key appointments from election-bound states like Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. As many as 27 OBCs were also accommodated in Team Modi as were 11 women.“For the first time since Independence, someone from Tripura has made it as a central minister,” said minister of state for social justice and empowerment Pratima Bhowmik who will be landing in Agartala on August 16 and will slowly make her way from one district to another. “I will travel for five days and cover all districts in my state, doing public meetings in each of them. I will be going to temples in each of the districts,” Bhowmik told HT.Party’s national secretary Sunil Deodhar said,” Take Kapil Patil (MoS Panchayati Raj) who belongs to the aagri community which got its first Union minister since Independence.”The ministers will take out ‘rath yatras’ on modified vehicles. “The plan will include paying tributes to any Ambedkar statue in the area or to meet a key community leader. We are working out the finer details,” said the office-bearer quoted above.Ministers who are Rajya Sabha members may cover more than one state. For instance, labour minister Bhupendra Yadav who was a key party leader before being appointed cabinet minister will travel to both Haryana and Rajasthan. HT has learnt that the minister is expected to hold public meetings in half a dozen constituencies starting August 19.The offices of law minister Kiren Rijiju and education minister Dharmendra Pradhan said they were waiting to hear from the party about the areas they would be travelling to. Petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri will join minister of state for external affairs and culture Meenakshi Lekhi reach out to people in Delhi.“It is a mass outreach programme but we are making sure that it will be done keeping all Covid protocols in mind,” said the party office-bearer.Most of the messaging will hinge on Covid management, and in the opposition-ruled states, the focus will be on attacking the local governments on Covid issues.With key state elections lined up in the coming year, the ministers are unlikely to find rest after the monsoon session of Parliament ends.“We have lost a year and a half due to Covid hence we have to work hard to strengthen the organisation,” Deodhar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjpplans-outreach-programmes-for-new-ministers-101628533577022.html
10-08-2021||India||Implication for India: Glacial retreat, cyclones and intense heat||Here’s a quick list of what a warming world means for India: glacial retreat in the Hindu Kush Himalayas; compounding effects of sea-level rise and intense tropical cyclones leading to flooding; an erratic monsoon and intense heat stress.Many of these are irreversible and cannot be remediated even if greenhouse gas emissions decline dramatically, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has indicated in a report released on Monday.And not only will India be hotter, it will be more humid.The report titled Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis released on Monday said heat waves and humid heat stress will be more intense and frequent during the 21st century over South Asia.The Indian Ocean which includes the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal has warmed faster than the global average, the IPCC said with “very high confidence.” Its oceans fact sheet indicates that sea surface temperature over the Indian ocean is likely to increase by 1 to 2 degree C when there is 1.5 degree C to 2 degree C global warming. For a country with a 7,516 km-long coastline, and an agricultural and rural economy still dependant on annual monsoon rains, that’s bad news.In high mountains in Asia, which includes the Himalayas, snow cover has reduced since the early 21st century, and glaciers have thinned, retreated, and lost mass since the 1970s, the IPCC said, although the Karakoram glaciers haven’t recorded any major retreating trend.Rising global temperatures and more rain can increase the occurrence of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) and landslides over moraine-dammed lakes, IPCC warned.India recently suffered a spate of flooding and landslide disasters in the high mountains of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. A snow-ice avalanche on February 7 in Uttarakhand triggered flash floods in the Rishiganga and Dhauliganga valleys, killing at least 200 people.Heat extremes have increased while cold extremes have decreased, and these trends will continue over the coming decades over Asia, according to the report. Annual mean temperatures in Asia will increase by 1-2 degree C relative to 1850-1900 period in case of 1.5 to 2 degree C global warming. There are likely to be 90 to 120 days in a year with maximum temperatures above 35 degree C in case of 1.5 to 2 degree warming and over 180 days in case of 4 degree C warming. The impact oof that on Indian agriculture could be catastrophic.Marine heat waves will continue to increase. And sea levels around Asia in the North Indian Ocean have increased faster than the global average, with coastal area loss and shoreline retreat. The regional-mean sea level will continue to rise, IPCC has said.“About 50% of the sea level rise is due to the thermal expansion. Also, Indian Ocean region is warming at a higher rate that means the relative sea level can also increase over the regions. Hence, the coastal regions will see the sea level rise through the 21st century, and it will contribute to more frequent and severe coastal flooding in low level areas and coastal erosion. Along with this, extreme sea level events that were previously seen once in a hundred years, could also happen every year by the end of the century,” said Swapna Panickal, IPCC author and climate scientist from Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.The ministry of environment, forest and climate change said on Monday that it welcomes the IPCC report, which “vindicates India’s position” on differentiated action needed by developed and developing countries. “Developed countries have usurped far more than their fair share of the global carbon budget. Reaching net zero alone is not enough, as it is the cumulative emissions up to net zero that determine the temperature that is reached. This has been amply borne out in the IPCC report. It vindicates India’s position that historical cumulative emissions are the source of the climate crisis that the world faces today... India’s cumulative and per capita current emissions are significantly low and far less than its fair share of global carbon budget,” a ministry statement said.Union environment minister Bhupendra Yadav also said in a tweet that the report was a clarion call for the developed countries to undertake immediate emission cuts and decarbonise their economies.Impact on monsoonThe monsoon has weakened in the second half of the 20th century mainly due to aerosols from human activity. Atmospheric aerosols are suspended liquid, solid, or mixed particles with highly variable chemical composition and size distribution.Though in the near term (the next 20 years) South and Southeast Asian monsoon and East Asian summer monsoon rains will be dominated by the effects of aerosols and internal variability, in the long-term, monsoon rain will likely increase.At 1.5 degree C global warming, heavy precipitation and associated flooding are projected to intensify and be more frequent in most regions in Africa and Asia, the report said.The global water cycle will continue to intensify as global temperatures rise, with rainfall and surface water flows projected to become more variable and unpredictable within seasons.At the global scale, extreme daily rainfall events are projected to intensify by about 7% for each 1 degree C of global warming. Extreme rainfall events are defined as the daily precipitation amount over land that was exceeded on average once in a decade during the 1850–1900 reference period.The proportion of intense tropical cyclones (categories 4-5) and peak wind speeds of the most intense tropical cyclones are projected to increase at the global scale with increasing global warming.Rainfall variability related to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is projected to be amplified by the second half of the 21st century, it added. The Indian monsoon is affected by ENSO.Many regions are projected to experience an increase in the probability of compound events (i.e different types of extreme events happening at the same time or one after the other). This can be particularly alarming for India, experts pointed.“2 degree C global warming has serious implications due to possible increases in extreme weather events like heat waves, heavy precipitation, intensification of tropical cyclones, etc. Also, the variability of climate will increase suggesting dry becomes drier and wet becomes wetter. Another worrying fact is that we should expect compounding extreme weather events. For example, drought followed by heat waves. A flood followed by another flood. We have not documented this very well,” said M Rajeevan, former secretary, ministry of earth sciences.Irreversible climate impactsThe IPCC report has flagged that the climate crisis has caused certain impacts globally which are irreversible. Mountain and polar glaciers will continue melting for decades or centuries, the IPCC said with ‘very high confidence’ implying that Himalayas in India and neighbouring countries could be facing irreversible changes.It is also certain that global mean sea level will continue to rise over the 21st century. In the longer term, sea level is committed to rise for centuries to millennia due to continuing deep ocean warming and ice sheet melt, and will remain elevated for thousands of years even if warming is limited to 1.5 degree C, the report said.“Some of the changes are locked in — these include increase in sea level rise, melting of glaciers and thawing of permafrost. In India, the increase in heat waves is masked by aerosol emissions; if these are cut down, further increases in heat waves are likely. Very strong increase in heat waves, heavy rainfall events, further melting of glaciers can be expected. Sea level rise will cause flooding when tropical cyclones hit. These impacts are here and will not go away,” said Friederike Otto, associate director, Environment Change Institute, University of Oxford during a media briefing on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/implication-for-india-glacial-retreat-cyclones-and-intense-heat-101628532256325.html
10-08-2021||India||Climate report unlikely to lead to extra efforts||The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on Monday, which said that extreme weather events have increased due to the rise in carbon emissions and the planet will reach 1.5 degrees Celsius warming threshold much earlier than anticipated, may not result in higher ambition at the Glasgow climate conference in November, said experts on climate change negotiations.IPCC’s Physical Science Basis report, the first of its three sixth assessment report, tells the world that oceans could rise by 1-2 feet even in one of the better scenarios (it considered five) by turn of this century, and heat waves occur 14 times as often if warming touches 2 degrees C.“The report tells us, we have a small window to act,” said Govindasamy Bala, professor at the Center for Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences in Indian Institute of Sciences, Bangalore, and one of the lead authors of the report.The report clearly mentioned that limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degree Celsius by turn of the century is becoming beyond reach. “Earlier, we had given 20 years for 1.5 degree temperature rise, now it is 10 years,” he said, adding that carbon emissions have already increased the temperature by 1.1 degree Celsius in the last 100 years. So, the world has window for only 0.4 degree C.To ensure that window remains open, Bala said the five scenarios presented by the report clearly show that there is no longer an option of a peaking year (when a country’s carbon emissions would peak) available with the planet to save it from dramatic danger of climate change.“We have to go for emission reduction and that is net zero,” he said.In the net zero concept, the world, as a whole, theoretically, will stop emitting carbon dioxide by 2050. A country will be able to emit carbon equal to the carbon sinks it has and the amount of carbon credits it can buy.Several European countries such as France, United Kingdom and Sweden have brought law to achieve net zero by 2050 and many others are on way to have similar laws.However, India and China, the world’s two biggest emitters have opposed net zero, saying it would go against the United Nations Climate Framework that provides for differentiated responsibility among developed and developing world and equity to carbon space. Net zero, they said, would impose binding restrictions on the developing world, which is historically not responsible for the problem of climate change.Sunita Narain, director general of Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said net zero was zero gain for developing countries as it would benefit the rich world, which has already exhausted its carbon space, and the developing world would continue to suffer in the absence of free technology transfer. “This report from global scientists must be a wake-up call. We can no longer lose time in prevarication or in finding new excuses not to act—including empty promises of net zero by 2050,” she said.Bala, however, said climate science supports net zero as the world cannot look at 2 or higher degree C climate scenarios anymore. “We have to aim for 1.5 degree temperature rise. Time to first allow emissions to rise and then reduce is not there.”A senior environment ministry official, who has been part of the climate negotiating team for long, said the IPCC report will not alter India’s climate negotiating strategy. “It is clear to us and several other developing countries that the Glasgow conference is to make Paris agreement operational. That will happen,” the official said. He added that the review of the target under the Paris climate deal would happen in 2023-24 and anything before that would depend on enhanced climate finance by the developed world.Climate talks have got more impetus in 2021 with appointment of John Kerry as US President Joe Biden’s special climate envoy. Kerry, since taking over in March, has visited several important countries for climate talks including biggest carbon emitters after United States, China and India. The US is keen to have higher ambition for Paris agreement, which becomes operational from January 2022.Kerry was in New Delhi in April 2021 for three days, but environment ministry officials said former environment minister Prakash Javadekar was very clear that the net zero concept was alien to the Paris agreement.Dr. Arunabha Ghosh, CEO of Council on Energy, Environment and Water, said, “Given that India is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries, we must recognise that even geographically faraway climatic changes can have consequences for our monsoons and intensity of extreme events. India should nudge the international community to capitalise a Global Resilience Reserve Fund to help lower the peaks of climate risks for the most vulnerable countries and create an insurance cushion against severe climate shocks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/climate-report-unlikely-to-lead-to-extra-efforts-101628532197279.html
10-08-2021||India||‘Global warming can’t be limited without drastic changes’||Hot extremes, humid heat stress, high sea-level rise, and more tropical cyclones. This is what is in store for India at 1.5 degrees C global warming, according to IPCC’s sixth assessment report ‘Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis’. In an email interview to HT, Swapna Panickal, climate scientist and co-author of the report said without immediate and large-scale reduction in global greenhouse emissions, even the 2 degree C warming threshold will be exceeded. Edited excerptsWhat are the climate change impacts already being documented in India? The South and Southeast Asian monsoon has weakened in the second half of the 20th century. Heat extremes have increased while cold extremes have decreased, and these trends will continue in the coming decades. The surface Indian Ocean has warmed faster than the global average. As a result, sea level will continue to rise in the 21st century. Sea level around Asia has increased faster than global average.Which of these are irreversible? The increase in ocean heat content and sea level rise are irreversible. Oceans will continue to warm. By 2050, sea level is expected to rise an additional 10–25 cm globally, whether or not greenhouse gas emissions are reduced. This is because sea level responds more slowly to changes in CO2 than other components of the climate system and will continue for some time even if emissions are stopped.How will climate change impact our glaciers? Snow cover has reduced since the early 21st century, and glaciers over the high mountain regions have thinned, retreated, and lost mass since the 1970s, although the Karakoram glaciers have either slightly gained mass or are in an approximately balanced state. Rising temperature and precipitation can increase the occurrence of glacial lake outburst, floods and landslides over high mountain regions.How will it affect the southwest monsoon? Projected precipitation changes in the near term (next 20-30 years) are uncertain due to natural variability, and this is an area of active research. Over South Asia, East Asia and West Africa, increases in monsoon precipitation due to warming from GHG (green house gas) emissions were counteracted by decreases in monsoon precipitation due to cooling from human-caused aerosol emissions over the 20th century, leading to a weakening of monsoon. But extremely heavy rain events will continue to rise.How is tropical cyclone frequency and intensity likely to change? The tropical cyclone intensity will increase; however, their genesis frequency will decrease or remain unchanged.How do you think India should prepare for 1.5 degree to 2-degree warm world? Unless there are immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, limiting warming to close to 1.5 degree C or even 2 degree C will be beyond reach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-warming-can-t-be-limited-without-drastic-changes-101628532138033.html
10-08-2021||India||PM Modi lists maritime security solutions||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday proposed five principles to ensure global maritime security, including responsible connectivity and peaceful resolution of disputes, as he chaired a UN Security Council debate that was joined by Russian President Vladimir Putin and US secretary of state Antony Blinken.India’s presidential statement on maritime security, which contained a tacit reference to China’s aggressive actions in the South China Sea by calling for ensuring the freedom of navigation in accordance with international laws, was adopted by the Security Council despite China holding out till the last minute, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.The rotating presidency of the Security Council is held by India for August and this was the first stand-alone discussion on maritime security by the UN’s highest body. India adopted a consensus-building approach by initiating consultations among all Security Council members several months in advance and prepared a concept note that incorporated ideas of all members.Modi, who became the first Indian premier to chair a meeting of the Security Council, called for a cooperative framework to deal with maritime disputes, climate change and natural disasters. He proposed five principles to develop a road map for global maritime security in his address in Hindi.The principles are removing barriers from legitimate maritime trade, encouraging responsible maritime connectivity, settling maritime disputes through peaceful means and on the basis of international law, jointly facing natural disasters and maritime threats created by non-state actors, and preserving the maritime environment and resources.“Oceans are our shared global commons. They are also the lifeline of international trade. Above all, they are key to our planet’s future,” the Prime Minister said. “However, today, this common heritage of ours faces various types of threats. Maritime routes are being misused for piracy and terrorism. There are maritime disputes between countries. And climate change and natural disasters are also challenges to our maritime domain.”“In this context,” Modi said: “We need a framework for mutual understanding and cooperation in order to conserve and utilise our shared maritime heritage. Such a framework cannot be created by any country alone. It requires a joint effort by all of us.”Modi highlighted the steps taken by India, including creating the maritime information fusion centre, responding to maritime disasters in the region, settling the maritime boundary with Bangladesh, and said such measures help build cooperation and trust.The debate on maritime security was one of three signature events being organised by India during its presidency of the Security Council – the other two will focus on counterterrorism and peacekeeping – and the presidential statement was the first outcome document by the UN body on maritime security.The presidential statement has to be adopted unanimously, but the process was not smooth as China held out till the very end because of language related to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the people cited above said. Indian negotiators helped find language acceptable to all members without dropping the reference to UNCLOS, which the four other permanent members of the Security Council insisted on retaining, the people added.The presidential statement focused on the primacy of international law, noting UNCLOS is the legal framework for all activities in the oceans, including countering illicit activities at sea. It also highlighted the importance of enhancing global and regional cooperation to counter threats to maritime safety and security.The statement promotes safe and secure shipping while ensuring freedom of navigation in line with international laws, and welcomes mutual legal assistance and other types of law enforcement cooperation on transnational organised crime.It calls for strengthening cooperation for maritime security, including against piracy and terrorist activities, as well as against transnational organised crimes. It also seeks enhanced cooperation to protect critical infrastructure, including cross-border infrastructure.Blinken, in his address, referred to India’s leadership on issues such as a free and open Indo-Pacific and collaborative efforts such as the maritime fusion centre that has enhanced cooperation among Indian Ocean partners. The freedom of navigation and overflight, and unimpeded flow of maritime commerce is critical to security of nations but there are also critical areas where maritime rules are under threat, such as the South China Sea, he said.Without naming China, Blinken said the South China Sea had witnessed dangerous encounters, “provocative actions to advance unlawful maritime claims” and to intimidate and bully states. “When nations ignore or purport to redraw the borders of other nations, whether by land or by sea, they undermine the sovereign equality of member states – a guiding principle of the UN,” he added.China’s deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dai Bing, sought to counter Blinken’s remarks by saying a “few countries are pursuing exclusive regional strategies in Asia-Pacific in an attempt to create and intensify maritime conflict” and weaken regional stability. He opposed the mention of the South China Sea and accused the US of “stirring up trouble out of nothing”.Putin said Russia wants to build productive cooperation with the Indian Ocean Rim Association and Indian Ocean Commission and help ensure security in the Persian Gulf and Atlantic Ocean. He called for a special structure within UN to fight maritime crimes in various regions.Four heads of state and government, including Modi and 10 ministers participated in the debate, including French foreign minister Jean-Yves le Drian and UK defence secretary Ben Wallace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-lists-maritime-security-solutions-101628531896195.html
10-08-2021||India||Opposition says it will back govt on OBCs bill||Opposition parties on Monday decided to “cooperate” with the government to pass the 127th amendment to the Constitution, restoring the power of states to identify socially and economically backward classes for reservation (quotas) in jobs and college admissions -- something that was taken away after a May verdict of the Supreme Court’s Constitution Bench that said only the President of India had this power.The decision of as many as 14 Opposition parties means that a Bill will finally be passed peacefully in the Monsoon Session that has suffered unabated disruptions and protests from the beginning. The Opposition, however, also decided to continue, inside and outside Parliament, its agitation over the Pegasus snooping controversy, the farm laws and spiraling price rise.In the Opposition’s meeting on Monday to decide a collective strategy for the last week of the ongoing session, Rajya Sabha Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge initiated the discussion, highlighting the need to reach a consensus on the 127th constitutional amendment. According to two leaders present in the meeting, he highlighted how states would benefit and how this important legislation has been brought to bypass the Supreme Court ruling.“All parties agreed to support the legislation to ensure that the Constitutional amendment is passed in unanimity,” said Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) leader NK Premachandran.The Union government’s review petition on the May verdict was also dismissed by the Supreme Court, necessitating the legislative approach even as states accused the Centre of taking away their rights in violation of the federal structure of the Constitution.Last month, social justice minister Virendra Kumar assured the Upper House that the government was in consultation with legal experts to find a way around the apex court’s ruling.The Centre’s position has all along been that the President’s power is restricted to identifying and categorising socially and educationally backward communities (SEBC) for the central list .The Opposition’s decision to support the move is understandable. It cannot oppose the amendment without looking anti-other backward classes (or OBCs, the most powerful political base in the country), and the change will help opposition parties in states where they are in power (just as it will with the Bharatiya Janata Party in states where it is).“The reason for the Opposition to come together to support the 127th Constitutional Amendment Bill, 2021, is the upcoming early elections next year in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa, Punjab and Manipur. Almost all the states going to the polls have a substantial OBC vote bank. Moreover, with the TMC (Trinamool Congress) winning in West Bengal, the Opposition has got a moral booster not only in opposing issues in Parliament jointly but also giving strategic support as an Opposition for election convenience. If this strategic behaviour of the Opposition is reflected in the elections, then the BJP might face a tough election battle,” said Achiransu Acharyya, economist, Visva Bharati University.The opposition parties also decided at Monday’s meeting that no other business would be allowed as long as the government doesn’t agree to their demand to discuss Pegasus in the House. Te government, which has neither confirmed nor denied the use of the spyware, has not agreed to this.“The meeting also discussed that some form of agitation should be launched to protest against the rising fuel prices in a day or two ,” said Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Elamaram Kareem.So far, the Monsoon Session of Parliament, which began on July 19, has been rocked by frequent protests and disruptions. Both Houses have seen Opposition lawmakers troop to the Well, hold placards and shout slogans against the government over their demand to discuss the Pegasus row, the three farm laws and rising fuel prices. Seven Trinamool MPs have faced suspension for “unruly” behaviour, even as opposition leaders accused the Chair of not allowing them to express their views.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-says-it-ll-back-govt-on-obcs-bill-101628531776838.html
10-08-2021||India||Code red: UN report rings climate alarm||The world may have lost the opportunity to keep global warming under 1.5 degree C over pre-industrial levels, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a new report on Monday, highlighting the climate crisis that the world faces.One of the report’s authors, Linda Mearns said it more evocatively during the release: “ I don’t see any area that’s safe... Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.”That isn’t hyperbole. Each of the five scenarios, based on varying levels of emission cuts, will see the world exceeding the 1.5 degree C mark set in Paris in 2015. And it will do this in the decade of the 2030s. And in three, it will exceed the 2 degree C mark, with “far worse heat waves, droughts and flood-inducing downpours”.India is no stranger to any of those.Glacial retreat in the Hindu Kush Himalayas; compounding effects of sea-level rise and intense tropical cyclones leading to flooding; an erratic monsoon and intense heat stress are likely to impact India in the years ahead, the report warned, even as it claimed that the Indian ocean has already warmed up faster than the global average.Most worryingly, one of the five scenarios is a best-case one: carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions declining rapidly to net zero around 2050. Even in this, the rise in global mean sea level could be 1-2 feet by 2100, and “6-12 inches” by the middle of the century, according to Bob Kopp, one of the authors.And to round off the summary of really bad news: the Arctic, according to the report, is now melting three times faster than originally estimated.In a stark warning to world leaders, the 42-page summary for policy makers titled: “Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis” drafted by 234 scientists from 66 countries (the report itself is an impressive 3,949 pages long, and based on an analysis of 14,000 scientific papers by experts) warned that global warming of 1.5 degree C relative to 1850-1900 levels would be definitely exceeded under intermediate, high and very high emission scenarios and will be “more likely than not to be exceeded” even when countries agree to switch to net-zero emissions by 2050.A net zero emission target implies that all human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are balanced out by removing GHGs from the atmosphere in a process known as carbon removal.But all may not be lost if the easier of the two Paris goals is met.The IPCC report underlines that human actions still have the potential to determine the future course of climate change and can strive to keep global warming under 2 degree C.That would involve zero emissions by the middle of the century, an immediate move away from fossil fuels, and a sustained effort at what is called engineered carbon removal (ways to suck CO2 from the air).The Paris Agreement goal, agreed upon by 195 countries is of limiting global warming to well below 2 degree C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5 degree C. At 2 degrees global warming, according to a simulation presented in the report, the Arctic will warm by at least 4-5 degrees C.There is a near-linear relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions from anthropogenic sources and global warming, the report shows. Each 1000 GtCO2 (gigaton) of cumulative CO2 emissions is likely cause a 0.45 degree C increase in global surface temperature. This relationship implies that reaching net zero anthropogenic CO2 emissions is a requirement to stabilise global temperature increase at any level because of a very limited carbon budget, the report said.“Stabilizing the climate will require strong, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and reaching net zero CO2 emissions. Limiting other greenhouse gases and air pollutants, especially methane, could have benefits both for health and the climate,” said IPCC Working Group I Co-Chair Panmao.The report shows that emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities are responsible for approximately 1.1 degree C of warming compared to pre-industrial levels, and finds that averaged over the next 20 years, global temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degree C warming.“Warming is an established fact. We are seeing widespread and rapid changes in every region of the world, affected in multiple ways by this changing climate. This includes heat waves, heavy rainfall events, droughts, compound extreme events see kit in every region of the earth. There is no going back from some of these changes even if we limit warming to 1.5 degree C. Compound flooding events, storm surges etc will continue. From a physical science point of view, it is still possible to limit global warming to 1.5 degree C and that would mean these changes could be slowed. If we reduce GHG emissions to net zero by 2040 there is still a two-thirds chance to limit global warming to 1.5 degree C and if we manage to reach net zero emissions by middle of the century there still a one third chance…” said Friederike Otto, associate director, Environment Change Institute, University of Oxford.In the next decade-and-half as the world heads towards 1.5 degree C warming, it will witness an increasing occurrence of extreme weather events, which are unprecedented in the observational record, IPCC said, adding that with every additional 0.5 degree C warming there will be a discernible increase in intensity and frequency of heat waves, extremely heavy rain events, as well as agricultural and ecological droughts (a period with abnormal soil moisture deficit, which happens due to rain deficit and excess evapotranspiration).The world will likely cross the 2 degree C threshold between 2041 and 2060 in the intermediate scenario when emissions decline slowly. And global temperature rise is likely to be 3.3 degree C to 5.7 degree C by 2100 under the very high greenhouse gas emissions scenario where little action is taken to reduce emissions. The IPCC considers five socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), which are essentially possible paths of growth human societies could follow over the next century.SSP2-4.5 or the intermediate scenario most closely mirrors the emissions trajectory that the total ambition of climate pledges (NDCs) submitted by 195 countries currently has the world on. CO2 continues to rise and stabilise around the mid-century, before finally starting to decrease, with the steepest drop just before the end of the century in this intermediate scenario. Under this scenario, the world is headed for a 2.7 degree C rise in global temperature by end of the century.The last time global surface temperature was sustained at or above 2.5 degree C higher than 1850–1900 was over 3 million years ago.How bad is it? As Paola Andrea Arias Gomez, another of the report’s authors said during its release, extreme heat waves, which are now occurring “five times as often as before” could occur “14 times as often” at 2 degrees C of global warming.“This report reflects extraordinary efforts under exceptional circumstances,” said Hoesung Lee, chair of the IPCC in a statement. “This report is a reality check. We now have a much clearer picture of the past, present and future climate, which is essential for understanding where we are headed, what can be done, and how we can prepare,” said IPCC Working Group I co-chair Valérie Masson-Delmotte.IPCC, however, clarified that occurrence of individual years with global surface temperature rise of 1.5 degree C or 2 degree C, relative to 1850–1900 does not imply that this global warming level has been reached.Through its assessments of all five scenarios, the IPCC said it is certain that the land surface will continue to warm more than the ocean surface -- by around 1.4 to 1.7 times. It is also certain that the Arctic will continue to warm more than global surface temperature at two times the rate of global warming.Some mid-latitude and semi-arid regions, and the South American Monsoon region, are projected to see the highest increase in the temperature of the hottest days, at about 1.5 to 2 times the rate of global warming. Extremely heavy rainfall events will intensify and become more frequent in most regions with additional global warming. At the global scale, extreme daily rain events are projected to intensify by about 7% for each 1 degree C of global warming. The proportion of intense, category 4/5 tropical cyclones will increase and the Arctic is likely to be practically sea ice free in September at least once before 2050 under all the five scenarios considered in the report.“The IPCC numbers sadly show that as humans we have failed to curb the emissions that would have kept global warming under 1.5 degree C or 2 degree C limits. The mitigation and adaptation strategies submitted by nations through the Paris Agreement are insufficient, and we have even failed to reach near the committed curbs on emissions,” Roxy Mathew Koll, climate scientist, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.“This points to the fact that we need urgent measures to evaluate and adapt to the increasing risk due to intense cyclones, floods and heat waves in the near future. While climate change is global, the challenges are always local. IPCC reports provides only a global assessment, and it is our task to identify the local challenges and disaster proof those regions where the risk and vulnerability is the highest.”India needs a plan, said M Rajeevan, former secretary, ministry of earth sciences.“The present assessment report is based on much improved climate models and also using more observed and paleoclimatic data. Therefore, future projections of the climate could be considered to have reduced uncertainty…India should raise to the occasion and plan how to mitigate things. We need to develop technologies for mitigating these extreme weather events. Prediction capability should be improved. Disaster management system should be strengthened. A lot of coordination should happen between ministry of earth sciences, national disaster management authority (NDMA) and state governments also participation of industries. We should not delay. Anyway, MoES has plans to improve their forecasting skill of extremes,” he said.The IPCC projections are expected to be a wake up call for world leaders ahead of UN climate negotiations (COP 26) in November. “The new IPCC report tells government leaders exactly what is at stake at COP26. Without rapidly cutting carbon dioxide emissions to net zero levels, we are headed for a 3 degree C hotter world with more frequent weather extremes, and dangerous disruptions in the climate. It is high time that developed countries seal the deal on adaptation finance and clean technology partnerships at COP26,” said Ulka Kelkar, director of the climate programme at the World Resources Institute, India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/code-red-un-report-rings-climate-alarm-101628531776264.html
10-08-2021||India||No deal with Pegasus maker NSO Group: Defence ministry||The defence ministry on Monday told the Rajya Sabha that it has had no dealings with Israeli cybersecurity firm NSO Group, which is at the centre of a global controversy over the misuse of its Pegasus spyware to hack phones of journalists, activists and politicians. In response to a question on the subject in the Upper House, minister of state for defence Ajay Bhatt said, “Ministry of Defence has not had any transaction with NSO Group Technologies.”The minister responded to a question from CPI-M’s V Sivadasan, who asked about the expenditure incurred by the ministry including money spent on purchases made from foreign countries during the last three years.The ministry’s one-line response to the query pertaining to the NSO Group comes at a time when the Opposition parties have continuously disrupted the functioning of the Parliament over the Pegasus snooping controversy. The Opposition has been consistent in its demand for a discussion on the matter in Parliament.On August 6, Hindustan Times reported that the Centre sought to disallow in the Rajya Sabha a question seeking details from the external affairs ministry on whether the government entered into a contract with NSO Group, stating that “the ongoing issue of Pegasus” is sub-judice after “several PILs have been filed in the Supreme Court.”That question asked whether the government entered into a contract with Israeli cybersecurity firm NSO Group, at the centre of a global controversy over the misuse of its Pegasus spyware to hack phones of journalists, activists and politicians.The Centre wrote to the Rajya Sabha secretariat earlier this week seeking that a “Provisionally Admitted Question”(PAQ) asked by CPI MP Binoy Viswam scheduled to be answered on August 12 in the Upper House, not be allowed .“I have been informed informally that my question was disallowed but I am yet to get a formal response... the government is misusing Rajya Sabha rules and taking an alien stand on truth. They must face questions on the issue of the Pegasus,” said Viswam.The Pegasus row erupted on July 18 after an international investigative consortium reported that the phones of Indian ministers, politicians, activists, businessmen and journalists were among the 50,000 numbers from around the world that were potentially targeted by the Israeli company NSO Group’s phone hacking software. The list database was first obtained by France-based non-profit Forbidden Stories, which shared the information with the reporting partners. The devices of at least 67 of the numbers were analysed by Amnesty International and of these, 37 had signs of being hacked by Pegasus. Of these 37, 10 were in India. NSO says its software is sold only to government customers.The Indian government has neither confirmed nor denied that it used Pegasus and has ruled out any illegal surveillance.To be sure, as the methodology of the investigation into the alleged snooping explains, the presence of a number on the database of the alleged targeted numbers does not indicate an individual’s phone was hacked — just that it was of interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-pegasus-row-mod-tells-rajya-sabha-no-dealings-with-nso-group-101628511195943.html

The party held a meet on Sunday where it decided to form state-level committees to organise these celebrations.“This August 15, 2021, when India enters 75th year of its Independence, Indian National Congress deems it imperative to celebrate the immense sacrifice of our freedom fighters and their families & successors… On the occasion of the nation entering the 75th year of Independence, the Indian National Congress has decided to form committees in all states to organise year-long celebrations,” a statement issued by All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary KC Venugopal said.The meeting of AICC general secretaries also discussed programmes for August 14 and 15. The party will be celebrating “Swatantra Senani & Shaheed Samman Divas” , a public event to “honour and facilitate the freedom fighters, their families, and martyrs’ families on August 14 evening”.Also Read | Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to arrive in Srinagar today for a 2-day visitOn August 15, the party workers will be taking out the “Swatantra March (Freedom March)” in the morning between 7-9am.In the statement, AICC also condemned the suspension of party leader Rahul Gandhi’s Twitter account after he shared pictures of his meeting with the parents of a minor rape victim in Delhi. Twitter brought down the tweets showing the faces of the girl’s parents, and Gandhi’s account was also suspended temporarily.“The atrocious stance is nothing but another instance of anti-SC and women mindset and inherent prejudice of Modi govt as also violation of freedom of expression by Twitter India under the diktat of Modi government,” Venugopal said.While Congress had said that Gandhi’s handle was “temporarily suspended”, Twitter said the account was “temporarily locked.”The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights also requested the Delhi Police and Twitter last week to act against Gandhi for his post. The commission had said that Gandhi’s post violated the Juvenile Justice Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-to-hold-year-long-celebrations-to-mark-75-yrs-of-independence-101628500994832.html

10-08-2021||Today's||Pegasus: India needs urgent surveillance reform||Information is power. A range of organisations — from private military firms such as NSO to various instruments of the State — collect information to empower governments. The quest for unbridled power and critical information often leads to using unprincipled and unlawful means.Snooping is a grim reality since the days of Chanakya, or indeed, ever since human beings constituted themselves as political units and statecraft evolved. But while recognising the compelling circumstances that may make it necessary at times, it constitutes a grave threat to democracy.In the case of Pegasus, the nature of the technology is additional cause for concern. The NSO Group co-founder is quoted as saying, “Pegasus is a Trojan horse that could be sent flying through the air to (break into) devices”.The government has denied that there has been any illegal interception in India, but there is overwhelming circumstantial evidence and some hard forensic evidence, obtained through mobile verification toolkit (MVT), to suggest that the Pegasus spyware indeed infected a set of targeted mobiles. Since unauthorised interception and hacking are offences under section 25 of the Telegraph Act and sections 43 and 66 of the Information Technology (IT) Act, the Opposition has paralysed Parliament proceedings, asking for a discussion and judicial probe. The issue has derailed the monsoon session of Parliament that ends this week.Reports of the widespread use of Pegasus have unnerved mobile users across the world. The technology war between advanced spyware systems and the defending Android and Apple operating systems will continue, each trying to outdo the other.Also Read | India needs a separate ministry to deal with the climate crisisThe core issue, however, is surveillance and who ordered it. Even if the government denial is to be believed, the targeting of such a huge number of mobiles should be the object of an impartial probe. And even beyond this probe is the critical issue of surveillance methods and the need for reforms.In 1997, the Supreme Court (SC) in PUCL vs UOI laid down the legal framework for telephone interception by the government. The Telegraph Act and IT Act 2000 give legal backing for interception of phones and computers. But in a Right to Information (RTI)-enabled regime, it is mandatory on the part of government to regularly audit interception logs and assure Parliament and citizens that due process has been followed.Since privacy is a fundamental right, it cannot be breached except in rare circumstances. A first information report can be lodged against illegal tapping. Unfortunately, there will have been a more robust legal architecture if the data privacy bill, after necessary revisions, had been passed — but after deliberations of a select committee, it remains in cold storage.The avenues for relief for victims, except the judiciary, are limited.The Pegasus attack calls for structural reform. Surveillance cannot be ordered and overseen by different layers of the executive alone. Ten agencies in India have the power to do so. The first anomaly is that the sanctioning officer, the home secretary, is of the same rank as the heads of these 10 agencies. Further, the oversight mechanism is even poorer, with the committee comprising the Cabinet secretary and two other secretaries.Also Read | Delhi: A feel good master plan isn’t enoughHas there been a case of a single rejection by the oversight committee or refusal of sanction to intercept in more than a few cases? Doesn’t the public ought to know these figures, and decision-making processes, with examples, to repose confidence in the system?This untrammelled power to intercept needs parliamentary or judicial oversight as a minimum correction. Such power can only be exercised in cases of national security, crime investigation and public emergency/safety. The SC judgment on privacy in 2017 makes it mandatory that such interventions meet the considerations of legality, necessity and proportionality.The government’s intransigence over the issue and the Opposition’s refusal to allow Parliament to function are hardly helping the cause of democracy. Incidents of brazen political misuse of interception powers have been raised time and again. What suits one political party while in power will not when it is in Opposition — hence, there is a need for all sides to come together, with the government agreeing to initiate surveillance reform. The Opposition should also participate in this joint effort to draw the contours of a new directive, after discussing relative merits/demerits of judicial and parliamentary oversight. It will help all parties, and ultimately the victims.It’s time to take these reforms to the next level too, by bringing intelligence agencies under parliamentary oversight by enacting a legislation. In United Kingdom, the internal intelligence agency MI5 is governed by The Security Services Act 1989 and the external intelligence agency by the Intelligence Services Act 1994. Similarly, in the United States, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is overseen by the CIA Act of 1949.Parliamentary oversight would require a tight group of Members of Parliament (MPs) across party lines, nominated by the prime minister. They can be kept in the loop about key decisions and made aware that all operations are in the nation’s interest. After 9/11, a bipartisan committee nominated by President George W Bush and the Congress, called the 9/11 Commission, investigated the failure of intelligence agencies and prepared a blueprint for reform. The time has come for Indian MPs to do the same.Pegasus may not even leave traces of malware in infected mobiles, but it does permanently scar a democratic system. The United Nations rapporteur for freedom of expression has called for banning the manufacture, sale and use of such spyware. However, nations themselves must act in the interest of free speech and expression. India, as the world’s largest democracy, has to walk the talk on the constitutional guarantees of freedom. An independent probe is a must — and so is the case for surveillance reform and parliamentary/judicial oversight of intelligence agencies.Yashovardhan Azad is chairman, Deepstrat, a former central information commissioner, and a retired IPS officer who served as secretary, security and special director, Intelligence BureauThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/pegasus-india-needs-urgent-surveillance-reform-101628602162097.html
10-08-2021||Today's||Delhi: A feel good master plan isn’t enough||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has published the draft Master Plan of Delhi (MPD) for 2041 for comments and suggestions. The draft MPD promises many elements to improve the quality of life for citizens on a sustainable basis: A 24-hour city, circular economy, blue-green networks, transfer of development rights, and transit-oriented development.The list is as long as a manifesto of a political party. But unlike manifestos, master plans are statutory documents with specific spatial proposals and realistic cost estimates that lead to their implementation. Yet, master plans are not implemented in Indian cities, because many of them are not feasible. Apart from weak institutional capacities and selective enforcement, there is one more reason why plans do not get implemented: Feel-good urban planning.This is the kind of planning where “feel-good” and fashionable terms are used, without any intention or commitment to do anything about it. If civil society groups put more pressure on the city authority, more terms or chapters will be added, and more promises will be made. This works perfectly well for the vested interests in a planning authority. They can continue to govern the city based on opaque regulations and ad hoc decisions, while ignoring or diluting the master plan. So, the modus operandi is to write what you like in the master plans, but circumvent the key proposals while detailing them out through rules and regulations.Also Read | To reduce emissions and fight climate crisis, de-carbonise power sectorWe must have public, legally binding documents such as master plans to guide urban development in cities. They are one more instrument to ensure accountability from the otherwise opaque planning authorities. The “feel-good” urban planning in the master plans needs to be replaced with realistic and pragmatic urban planning.There are four important checkpoints to ensure the implementation of a master plan, and the MPD-2041 should be put through this scrutiny: Learning from past failures, planning with specific spatial proposals, planning with a realistic budget, and finally, developing a robust implementation mechanism.In the last 20 years, Delhi has seen a rapid expansion of its boundaries, development of the metro rail and the building of many flyovers and housing projects. Did MPD-2021 guide this development, or did the city develop despite the master plan? Or worse, did the master plan came in the way of taking some sensible decisions about the city? DDA must start by answering these uncomfortable questions, before finalising this new master plan.The sealing drive of 2007 should remind everyone about the fallacies of rigid norms, obsolete methods, and weak enforcement capacities. We do not learn from past failures in urban development and old practices with new names continue. MPD-2041 should make a start by acknowledging the implementation bottlenecks of the previous MPD-2021.The draft MPD-2041 is comprehensive in terms of its coverage but not specific and at times, vague. It seems that depth is compromised on account of breadth. For example, DDA has been talking about “transit-oriented development” (TOD) for the last 20 years. It simply means ensuring that more people work and live next to transit lines with mix-use development and walkable neighbourhoods/work districts.Also Read | India needs a separate ministry to deal with the climate crisisIndeed, Delhi, with a good network of public transit zones, needs to implement such ideas in the long-run.But the current draft of MPD-2041 does not have a single map indicating where these transit zones are planned. The TOD zones are to be identified and notified separately by DDA. Transit influence zones where new housing or workplaces will be proposed should be integral to the new master plan. Apart from a legally mandated land use plan, there are no other maps or specific spatial proposals as part of the current draft. This kind of vagueness is only helpful in remaining non-committal about the future of the city.Master plans around the country, at least the good ones, give broad cost estimates to implement the key proposals. Based on master plan estimates, the implementing agencies make their budgets. Any plan is implemented in India by breaking down the provisions through annual budgetary allocations. This is a major shortcoming in the draft of MPD-2041. There are no specific cost estimates given and the key proposals are not detailed.Without the fiscal discipline of cost estimates and budgetary links, the “feel-good” urban planning has reduced the master plan draft to a wish list of sorts. Since the master plan of Delhi becomes a default planning manual for many cities and towns in north India, this is a terrible omission with its implications going beyond Delhi.Finally, who will implement the MPD-2041? Given the multiplicity of authorities and agencies in Delhi, there is no one answer to this crucial question. It is a shared responsibility between DDA, different municipal corporations and other government agencies.For the MPD-2021, a monitoring committee under the lieutenant-governor (L-G) used to meet once a year to remind every other agency that we have a master plan. What Delhi needs is an implementation committee — not only monitoring — under L-G (given the current structure) that oversees the progress of the master plan linked with a specific budget contributed by different agencies.In absence of the clear implementation pathways, the master plan of Delhi may well remain a “feel-good” document. Eliminating implementation bottlenecks, developing specific proposals, making budgetary allocations, and assigning responsibilities are guaranteed ways of implementing a master plan. A good master plan is an implemented one.Rutul Joshi teaches urban planning at CEPT University, Ahmedabad and keenly interested in reforming urban planning practices in IndiaThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/delhi-a-feel-good-master-plan-isn-t-enough-101628601261728.html
10-08-2021||Today's||India needs a separate ministry to deal with the climate crisis||The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a body of the United Nations that collects and analyses data on the advancement of the climate change process. IPCC’s reports are assessed frequently and emerge in a broad cycle of five-seven years. The sixth assessment cycle is underway at present. IPCC will release its full report by 2022, eight years after the last report was published. Its first report on the physical science basis of climate crisis is just out after it cleared several rounds of negotiation.The latest IPCC report showed that in the past eight years, a lot of changes have occurred. Assessing the data from the past three decades, scientists have issued warnings on three key aspects of climate.One, there isn’t an iota of doubt that human activities are solely responsible for a rapidly changing climate.Second, the earth’s temperature is increasing at a rate that has not happened in the last 2000 years. Apart from CO2, methane is also pointed out as Green House Gases (GHGs) that is contributing to global warming. This pace and business as usual scenario mean that it would be extremely difficult to keep the earth’s temperature below 1.5°C by end of the century.Third, this would be the last chance for humanity to keep the world’s temperature limited to 1.5°C since the pre-industrial age. Every fraction of the warming matters for us as global warming is contributing to glacial retreat, rising heat waves, and warming of oceans that feed into the increase in frequency and severity of cyclones.The next 10 years are crucial for humanity. We must work collectively towards bringing down the emissions and reduce them slowly to make them net-zero by 2050.Over the past couple of months, India has witnessed some of the extreme weather events which could be attributed to precipitously changing climatic conditions. Be it the Chamoli disaster, the super-cyclones Tauktae and Yaas and extreme precipitation events in some of the states, India is facing severe challenges linked to nearly every climatic parameter.India’s agro-ecology ranges from desert to cold climatic conditions, from coastal to mountain environments, along with a large pool of semi-arid regions. We are facing challenges in all these zones, be it unpredictable monsoon and floods, sea-level rise, melting Himalayan glaciers, rise in frequency and severity of cyclones, or extreme heat waves.Unlike earlier, the climate crisis has become a part of mainstream discourse, thanks to some of the extreme weather events experienced in India this year.When the issues of the climate crisis are at the forefront, why is the climate change division still attached to the ministry of environment and forests? At present, the department acts as a nodal agency that looks after the issues of the climate crisis cooperation, global negotiations, and the National Action Plan for Climate Change. The climate crisis is much more than the environment and forests, and having merely a division or a desk within the ministry will not help the cause.To minimise the impact of the climate crisis, India needs to focus on adaptation and mitigation efforts simultaneously. Now, to evade climate-related risks, India depends on forecasts and evacuates people. The relief-and-rescue operations are an aftereffect of freak weather events but a lot more work is required to make people adapt to the situation.It needs coordination with other sectors for effective climate action, including infrastructure, energy, irrigation, water, rural, urban, women and child development. The task is enormous for a country like India with its size and population.A long-term solution would be in redrawing or rebuilding city plans to make them climate-resilient, in restoring lakes and ponds in urban and rural areas, working towards strengthening natural drainage systems, building storm water systems in urban areas, forest restoration and related climate mitigation efforts. Apart from this, India needs to work with industries and businesses in bringing consensus to achieve net-zero by mid-century.India must do a lot more to take climate action forward and is poised to be the world’s leader in negotiating the climate crisis in international negotiations. This is especially for the countries of the Global South where there is a leadership vacuum. Some of its work on energy efficiency and initiating the International Solar Alliance show that India has the potential to lead the adaptation and mitigation efforts. But that credibility will come only when we do better in putting our house in order.All these tasks cannot be handled by having an agency within a ministry. India must create a separate ministry of climate crisis and chart out a better future for its people and show the world that it is possible to balance between planet, people and profit and work towards a green growth economy.Anjal Prakash is research director at Bharti Institute of Public Policy, Indian School of Business.

10-08-2021||Today's||To reduce emissions and fight climate crisis, de-carbonise power sector||The news is worse than expected. The United Nation’s Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), of which India is one of the 195 members, released its sixth assessment report (AR6) on Monday. The report, Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis, shows that global warming is on track to hit 1.5 degrees Celsius (°C) around 2030, a decade earlier than projected in 2018, and the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have reached the highest in the past 800,000 years.At 1.5°C global warming, heavy precipitation and associated flooding are projected to intensify and become more frequent in most regions in Africa and Asia. The report added that scientists have “high confidence” in the projection and that the changes in climate are a result of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions.To halt these catastrophic future projections, the world must embark on strong and sustained reduction in emissions in the next few years. The global energy sector (power, heat and transport) accounts for around 73% of total emissions. But it is also the engine behind every country’s economic and development plans, more so in emerging and developing economies whose per capital energy consumption is much lower than the global average.Also Read | Oxygen for India: Building a more resilient health systemTo reduce emissions, solar energy is the ideal solution for all countries, especially in the developing world where much energy capacity is yet to be installed. Solar is the cheapest source of electricity today, which makes it the smartest choice for new power capacities. Improved storage can eliminate intermittency. Solar can be also scaled up or down to meet demands; it can power zero-emission mobility; and most importantly, it is on its way to become a self-contained emission-free ecosystem. In 2019, the total investment in solar was $131 billion; its global capacity has grown by more than 26 times since 2009, and the sector is expected to support 22 million jobs by 2050.Decentralised solar photovoltaic (PV) systems work well in the remotest areas, and solar agricultural pumpsets offer a clean and affordable alternative to diesel fuel. For instance, PV systems up to 1.5MWp are running successfully in the high altitudes of Ladakh, and solar agri pumpsets in sub-Saharan Africa have led to better and more reliable irrigation, higher crop yields, and up to a 30% rise in disposable incomes for farmers.Even in the Indian power sector, solar is emerging as the most economical option. Recent price discoveries, the government’s support for achieving self-reliance in the sector, and the opportunity of pairing energy from solar with storage are promising developments that are going to bring down the last remnants of cost competitiveness of thermal power plants against renewables. With an improved market design and a pool of capital to stir investments in the sector, solar is poised to outcompete traditional thermal-based power generation.The International Solar Alliance (ISA) has supported several central and regional governments to improve techno-economic feasibility of solar. We are applying the lessons to intensify this momentum and amplify solar for net-zero global emissions through global advocacy (by providing global information on progress in solar technologies, markets and enabling their application to countries). We are building ecosystems for the flow of inexpensive capital to all countries, and for upgrading skilled workers for a solar-powered green economic recovery. And ISA is helping the most challenged countries to initiate solar projects, which would also streamline their policies and processes for future investments.This will enable the world to invest in solar energy, facilitate global investment flows and ensure that solar applications are amplified several times over. The technology is ready and it is cost-effective; we need global collaboration to scale it up exponentially and expeditiously.Ajay Mathur is director-general, International Solar AllianceThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/to-reduce-emissions-and-fight-climate-crisis-de-carbonise-power-sector-101628598861449.html
10-08-2021||Today's||The climate crisis is not the third wave. It is the permanent flood||The Covid-19 pandemic is a crisis of a nature that we have not faced in our lifetimes. The climate crisis, while operating on a longer timescale, is a catastrophe for which there is no historical precedent. We are the first species with the sentience to foresee the change we are causing while it is happening, and the prowess to prevent it.The goal of the Paris Agreement was to limit global temperature increase to below 2, and ideally to 1.5 degrees Celsius, in comparison to pre-industrial levels. In a report released on Monday, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change sounded a dire warning — at the current rate of emissions, we will not meet Paris targets. It seems the world is looking for offsets without wanting to make any changes to lifestyles — hoping for a climate crisis “vaccine” to come along to save the day.In How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, Bill Gates spelled out the bleak future that awaits us if we do not restrict emissions. “By mid-century, climate change could be just as deadly as COVID-19, and by 2100 it could be five times as deadly... in the next decade or two, the economic damage caused by climate change will likely be as bad as having a COVID-sized pandemic every 10 years.”Also Read | ‘Climate change is for real, 100% certainty that it is caused by human activity’This is a critical time for humanity. If we are not able to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by the end of the decade, we will not be on track to cut all emissions by mid-century. But currently, not enough is being done to decarbonise economies quickly. And unfortunately, the climate crisis is not like a virus that recedes once there are no longer people to be infected. Greenhouse gases will remain in the air even after we stop emitting them — their effects felt for hundreds, if not thousands of year. Coral reefs will continue to die. Ice will continue to melt, and sea levels will continue to rise.There is no vaccine for the climate crisis that will fix the problem of emissions. Carbon capture by planting trees and through technology are necessary, but can’t keep up with the current rate of emissions. And there is yet to be an agreed upon set of measures that can be taken both at an individual and country-level to mitigate the climate crisis.There is no equivalent of masking or getting vaccinated, partly because of the ubiquitous nature of industrial activities that led to modern society. We spent trillions of dollars in creating extractive societies without sparing a thought about consequences. Averting the climate crisis is not just a technological problem — we need a change in development models, values, and behaviours. Unfortunately, the climate crisis is simply not a priority for most citizens or elected officials. Even when acknowledged, it proceeds on a longer timeframe than a news-cycle or election term. In the light of this, there is little incentive to make difficult decisions.During this pandemic, rich nations fared relatively well in securing doses of vaccines for their residents. They are now clamouring for additional booster shots while residents of poorer countries remain completely unprotected. Every country will look after its own interests first. This does not portend well for the climate crisis. Many of the countries that exploited resources unsustainably and put the planet in this precarious position are located outside of the equatorial belt. While they will suffer heatwaves, they may be able to weather some of the effects better.It is in the best interest of many countries that are in the equatorial belt to avert the climate crisis, even as they seek to raise the standard of living of their citizens. The challenge here will be pitting lives against livelihoods, as we saw in the pandemic.Despite technological advances, most humans live in a very narrow window of the Earth’s existing climates. Modeling changes in temperature, Marten Scheffer and other scientists reported last year in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that in the next half century, up to 3 billion people might live in climate conditions outside of those that humans have found tolerable throughout history. Many of these people will be subject to temperatures that currently exist only in a few places such as the Sahara. Given that most of them will be poor, they will not be able to relieve themselves of these horrendous conditions simply through migration to cooler countries.We have seen travel entry restrictions imposed on countries where coronavirus transmission were rampant. The climate crisis will result in economic migrants — we can expect exclusionary borders by countries that have more natural resources and are far from the equator.Like many others, I read William Thackeray’s poem about King Canute wishing the tide to recede in school. I have been thinking about this poem recently in light of the ongoing climate crisis, not metaphorically, but literally. Melting glaciers and ice sheets in the Artic, Antarctica, and Greenland are causing sea-level rise. We can wish it were not so, but the reality is that rising sea waves do not heed the recriminations of the suffering. It may be too late to save Arctic summer ice. But if the Antarctic ice sheets disappear then part of the world that my ancestors lived in for thousands of years — coastal Odisha and Bengal — will be inundated. The consequences for metropolises such as Miami, Shanghai, Mumbai, and Kolkata will be devastating.We may be in the middle of a devastating pandemic, but the time to act is now. The climate crisis is not the third wave, it is a permanent flood that does not recede.Anirban Mahapatra, a microbiologist by training, is the author of COVID-19: Separating Fact From Fiction.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-climate-crisis-is-not-the-third-wave-it-is-the-permanent-flood-101628577979938.html
10-08-2021||Editorials||The century’s most pressing crisis is here||The United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its sixth assessment report (AR6) on Monday. The predictions are calamitous. In the next 20 years, the world will exceed the 1.5 degree Celsius threshold set in the Paris Climate Agreement (2015). If the current rate of emissions continues, global warming will be above 2 degrees Celsius by 2100. With every 1 degree rise in temperature, there will be a 7% increase in the intensification of extreme rain events. Some changes — increase in sea level rise, melting of glaciers and thawing of permafrost — have already caused a rupture. India is also witnessing drastic changes: Glacial retreat in the Himalayas, compounding effects of sea-level rise and intense tropical cyclones leading to flooding, an erratic monsoon, and intense heat stress.Also Read | India needs a separate ministry to deal with the climate crisisThe new report comes less than three months before a key climate summit in Glasgow, and is a wake-up call. While India is the third-highest annual polluter of CO2, the scale of its contribution is insignificant. New Delhi must stick to the principle of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities, but at the same time raise its climate ambitions. It has made progress in its efforts towards decoupling economic growth from emissions and has played a leadership role in launching initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance, Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, and raising the domestic renewable energy target to 450 GW by 2030.But there is scope to do more in several other sectors: Mobility, housing, and affordable energy. To give shape to these ambitions, it is also imperative, as climate expert Navroz Dubash wrote in these pages, to build and strengthen domestic institutions for climate governance. The climate crisis requires both looking across boundaries (international and national) and building a strategic focus on future development pathways. This is the 21st century’s most pressing crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-century-s-most-pressing-crisis-is-here-101628603961887.html
10-08-2021||Editorials||The SC takes on abuse of power||In a significant order on Tuesday, the Supreme Court issued a set of clear instructions to counter the stark and growing criminalisation of Indian politics, the reluctance of political regimes to take on this threat, the misuse of political power to brush away such cases, and the inordinate delay that makes justice not just elusive but often impossible to achieve. A bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI), NV Ramana, has disallowed states from withdrawing criminal cases against Members of Parliament (MPs) and Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs), without the approval of the corresponding high court. The court has also said that trial judges, presiding over such cases, should continue in their posts — in the backdrop of the often expedient transfer of such judges when they turn out to be less than pliant to political interference. It has pulled up the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for failing to submit a status report on details of cases the agency is pursuing against elected representatives and gave it a “last chance” to do so. And it has indicated that a special bench may be constituted to monitor and ensure the expedited conclusion of such cases within a year of charges being framed.Also Read | When the political class unitesThe relationship between politics and law is complicated in India. In theory, no one, irrespective of status or power, can evade the law. But as political scientist Milan Vaishnav’s work has shown, due to both an abundance of supply and demand in the political marketplace, those with criminal records fight elections — and often win. Political parties also instigate riots to polarise the electorate for political benefit, even if it means inviting criminal charges. When in power, parties have a vested interest in blocking such cases from proceeding, offering protection to leaders in return for continued loyalty. As the amicus curiae’s findings showed, a range of states — Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand — have either withdrawn or are seeking to withdraw cases against legislators. This makes a mockery of the rule of law; ensures impunity, for there is no punishment for crime and wrongdoing; and makes the electoral competition unfair.By pointing to the need for public and timely disclosure of criminal antecedents, quick disposal of cases, and instituting checks to ensure that political interference does not lead to erosion of law, the court is seeking to ensure a healthier democracy. The failure of the legislative and executive branches makes it incumbent on the judiciary to continue doing so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-sc-takes-on-abuse-of-power-101628601381665.html
