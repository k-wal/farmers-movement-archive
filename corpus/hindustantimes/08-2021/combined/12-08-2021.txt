A 31-point circular highlighting the state government’s achievements has been worked out and sent to all the district magistrates by chief secretary RK Tiwari, asking them to hold programmes on August 15 to convey to people its priorities to bring about development and how it was working to make UP a ‘Sarvottam Pradesh’. It also says that people should be inspired to follow ideals of “panth nirpekshata” (secularism). Besides giving broad outlines on flag hoisting in the forenoon, the chief secretary in his order dated August 6 said, “If possible freedom fighters should be invited to these programmes with respect.” “Large participation of people should be ensured on this occasion to inspire and educate people and create an atmosphere of peace and amity in the state,” said chief secretary while asking the district officials to hold these programmes at block, tehsil and district levels. “Whichever party is in power will always like to use any such opportunity to take its achievements to the people. It is all being done keeping in mind 2022 assembly elections in the state and there is nothing wrong with the move,” said SK Dwivedi, former head of department, political science, Lucknow University. Giving details about preparations being made for possible third wave of Covid-19 and how the state government has been able to contain the pandemic, the chief secretary said, “State government was following the idea of ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas evam sabka vishwas’ to make ‘aatma nirbhar bharat’ and remains committed to realise the resolve of ‘Saaf Niyat, Sahi Vikas’ (honest intent and right kind of development) to bring prosperity in lives of the people of all sections of the society.” Asking district officials to use the occasion to inspire the people about idea of secularism, the chief secretary further said, “Throwing light on the original idea of ‘panth nirpekshta’ (secularism), people should be inspired about how nation and society can be built by having love for each other and not by hatred and enmity but by respecting each other’s religion, caste, ideas and great personalities.” “Historical decisions and steps oriented towards development and public welfare indicate that the state government is most sensitive towards common man’s development and security and the law and order situation. The state government is turning challenges into opportunities for development… This country can develop and progress with mutual confidence, amity and unity among the people of all religions and communities,” said Tiwari. When contacted, Tiwari said there was nothing new in issuing the circular. “Independence Day celebration is an opportunity to tell people about what the state government is doing for the people. Such circulars are issued every year though focus may be different in different years,” he said.“We have asked for compliance of Covid-19 guidelines at these programmes,” he said when asked whether any programme was organised during the pandemic last year. “The BJP government has done nothing in the past four and a half year. It should not indulge in any politics on the occasion of Independence Day,” said Samajwadi Party spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/convey-govt-s-development-work-to-people-on-i-day-up-chief-secy-to-dms-101628792867820.html
12-08-2021||Mumbai||KEM Hospital becomes first public institution in Mumbai to conduct hand transplant||A young man from Madhya Pradesh underwent a hand transplant at Parel’s KEM Hospital, which became the first public-run institution to carry out the procedure in Mumbai. The 14-hour-long surgery was completed early on Thursday by a team of doctors led by plastic surgeon Dr Vinita Puri. Doctors said the next 10 days will be critical to know if the limb was accepted by the recipient’s body successfully. “All we need is good wishes and prayers for the patient right now,” said Puri, adding, “Seven to 10 days after the transplant is the most critical phase.” After the transplant, the recipient was shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) where he will be monitored round the clock. “The recipient is a double amputee in his late twenties,” said Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM Hospital. The team of doctors attempted to transplant both hands, but could go ahead with transplanting only the right hand. The procedure also marked the city’s first dual-hand donation. The young organ donor was declared brain dead at a hospital in south Mumbai, after which the family consented to donate all organs, tissues and hands. The family’s noble gesture gave a new lease of life to four patients suffering from end-stage ailments — the kidneys were transplanted to two patients in KEM and Nanavati hospitals, the liver to a patient at SRCC Hospital and the lungs were sent for transplant at a hospital in Hyderabad. The donor’s heart could not be retrieved. Thursday’s hand transplant procedure is first for a public-run hospital and the second one in the city. Mumbai’s first such procedure — a bilateral hand transplant — was carried out on train accident victim Monika More in August 2020 at the privately-run Global Hospital. The hands were donated by a family of a brain dead patient in Chennai. Hand transplants are difficult procedures and much more technical than solid organ transplants like kidneys or liver. These procedures are known as composite allotransplantations and involve connecting two main arteries, bones, multiple veins, nerves and tendons. “Hand transplants are extremely challenging procedures,” said Dr K Subramania Iyer, who led the team that carried out India’s first such procedure at Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences in Kochi in 2015. Since then, there have been only about a dozen such procedures in the country. The first person who underwent the bilateral hand transplant is doing very well and is employed as a transplant coordinator at Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences. “We are yet to see a massive rise in the number of organ transplants in the country. Hand transplants are even more difficult due to reluctance of the families, lack of awareness among transplant coordinators among other things,” he said. According to Iyer, the lack of donor hands is a major problem in driving the hand transplant programme ahead. “We have seven people on our waiting list as of today,” he said. Mumbai has carried out four cadaver organ donations in the past three days and 22 throughout this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kem-hospital-becomes-first-public-institution-in-mumbai-to-conduct-hand-transplant-101628792327797.html
12-08-2021||Mumbai||1,150 IIT-Bombay students got job offers during 2020-21 placement season||Around 1,150 students of the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) were recruited by 292 companies in the campus placement season of 2020-21, despite Covid-19 affecting the recruitment process. According to data mentioned in the institute director’s report released last week, of the total 1,261 offers made by recruiters, 1,150 were accepted by students. This is marginally lower than last year’s 1,209 offers. The Covid-19 pandemic played spoilsport in the campus recruitment process last year after which most IITs chose to conduct the placement process online. Last year when the pandemic broke out, many companies rescinded their offers made to students during the placement drive of 2019-20. “Given that the placement season was conducted during a raging pandemic and given the market conditions, we are very happy with the number of offers students received,” said a member of the placement office of IIT-B, on the condition of anonymity. A total of 58 international offers were made this year, with the highest salary being ₹1.4 crore (approx. Euro 157,000). The highest domestic salary offered was ₹64 lakh.However, the average salary dropped by around 10% in 2020-21 compared to the previous year. The average cost to company for a student had increased from ₹17.49 lakh in 2018-19 to ₹20.08 lakh in 2019-20, but it decreased to ₹17.91 lakh in 2020-21. “The average salary is subjective to various aspects of the placement season. Considering the pandemic and the market, it is not a significant drop,” said the official. This year, too, the institute has decided to continue with an online placement season in the interest of students’ safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/1150-iit-bombay-students-got-job-offers-during-2020-21-placement-season-101628792088926.html
12-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra issues GR to reduce school fees by 15%||Wary of adverse reactions from parents, the Maharashtra government on Thursday decided to go ahead with its decision to reduce school fees by 15%, despite the opposition from several cabinet ministers. A government resolution (GR) to this effect was issued by the education department on Thursday evening. Coincidentally, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday announced a statewide agitation for reduction in school fees, saying the government is full of education barons, who don’t want this to happen. Several Nationalist Congress Party-Congress ministers run private educational institutions. School education minister Varsha Gaikwad had on July 28 declared the cabinet had decided to slash private school fees for the current academic year by 15%. The decision was taken on the lines of the Supreme Court’s (SC) order for reduction of fees for schools in Rajasthan. Last month, the Apex court had asked the Maharashtra government to consider its May judgement to collect 15% lower school fees. The court was hearing a special leave petition filed by schools against the Bombay High Court order dated March 1, 2021 that had vacated the stay on the government resolution (GR) (issued on May 8, 2020) restraining schools from hiking fees for the academic year of 2020-21 in view of the pandemic. The state school education department also wanted to bring in an amendment to the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011 as the government has no powers to intervene in matters related to fees in private unaided schools. According to the legal advice sought by the department, the government resolution will have no legal standing without the government having jurisdiction to intervene. Other ministers were, however, of the view that there was no need to intervene in matters related to private schools as they were facing financial issues. They also said that amending the existing fee regulation act was unnecessary, and an order (GR) was enough to implement it. The proposal for amendment in the act could not be approved in the state cabinet meeting held on Wednesday. In its GR issued on Thursday, the school education department referred to the SC order and said, “For the academic year 2021-22, all schools should reduce fees by 15%. In cases where fees were already paid by the parents, the excess amount (15% of the total fees) should be adjusted in the coming months of this academic year and if it is not possible then it should be returned to the parents. In case of a dispute over fee reduction, divisional grievance redressal committees can be approached and their decision will stand final… No school management should stop students from attending physical or online classes or appearing for exams in case full or partial fees are pending. The management is also not allowed to hold their exams results.” “Most private schools have reached a decision in mutual understanding with parents over fees. They have also collected the fee amount and any such order is likely to create a mess,” said a senior minister, requesting anonymity. Another senior NCP minister said, “The proposal for reducing 15% fees was not opposed in the cabinet meeting. There were differences over the way the decision needs to be implemented.” State revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat said, “Many private schools are shut for more than one-and-a-half years. If the parents are in financial trouble, we can understand, but if the parents will pay lower fees otherwise, the school management will not be able to pay the salaries of their staff.” “Issuing a GR makes no sense as it will not stand in the court of law,” said a senior school education official, wishing not to be named. There has been a constant demand from parents to reduce school fees as people are in trouble owing to subsequent lockdowns imposed to contain Covid-19 pandemic. Soon after the Supreme Court order, parents from Maharashtra in a letter addressed to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Gaikwad urged the state to grant some relief to parents of private schools in the state. It was written on behalf of Indiawide Parents Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-issues-gr-to-reduce-school-fees-by-15-101628792087700.html
12-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Railway pass is now available online too||The state government on Thursday made available online a facility to get season ticket for railway travel from August 15. Citizens who are fully vaccinated and have completed 14 days after their second dose can get the e-pass through a link that can be accessed on all browsers – http://epassmsdma.mahait.org. Once applicants upload their documents and these are verified, an e-pass will be generated on the weblink. The e-pass needs to be saved on the applicants’ mobile phones, and produced at ticket counters to get the monthly railway pass. The offline verification process will still continue at 53 railway stations in the city, where Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has set up help desks, and at 109 railway stations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. However, those who apply online, do not need to separately do the verification process offline at railway stations, and can directly avail the railway pass at ticket counters. Tickets will be issued by the railway authorities. Meanwhile, on Thursday, the second day of issuing monthly railway passes, 20,637 monthly railway passes were issued to passengers till 5pm. Of these, 14,688 were issued by the Central Railway (CR) and 5,949 by the Western Railway (WR). On the Central Railway, the highest number of passes was issued from Dombivli (1,033) on the second consecutive day. Similarly, on the WR, the maximum number of passes was issued from Borivli (496). Twelve air-conditioned (AC) local train passes, 4,105 second class passes and 638 first class passes were issued by the WR on Thursday till 5pm. Authorities have stated that the number of passengers is fewer than anticipated. “The possibility of many passengers not being fully vaccinated or the 14-day gap could be the reason,” said a senior railway official. A total of 34,353 monthly suburban railway passes were issued to passengers on day one on Wednesday. The CR had issued 22,689 monthly passes, while the WR issued 11,664. The state government’s MAHA-IT, Maharashtra Knowledge Innovation Society and a couple of start-ups, played an active role under relief and rehabilitation department’s principal secretary Aseem Kumar Gupta to roll out the portal. “We got in touch with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for integration of our portal with Co-WIN for verification of details related to vaccinated people. After the announcement by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday, all procedures were completed in just two days,” said an official from the relief and rehabilitation department. The department has reportedly spent around ₹3 lakh to activate the system. The official said that the state was mulling the idea of using the universal pass for entry for train, air travel and also for entry at malls, theatres, markets. “It is a foolproof system enabled with blockchain technology integration and nobody can fudge with the data, as was found to have done in earlier systems. Except for the photograph, all other information is obtained from Co-WIN using application programming interface. It is very easy to use as the citizen gets OTP for initial verification within seconds and the QR-code enabled pass in the next 24 hours,” the officer said. The state expects a maximum of 2 million people to register themselves for the universal pass. “Of the 3 million citizens fully vaccinated in MMR, more than 40% are either elderly people or don’t travel by train. Of the remaining, some may go for offline registration,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-railway-pass-is-now-available-online-too-101628791429535.html

Of late, UP RERA has successfully revived several housing projects that were lying incomplete or were stuck due to various reasons, including non-compliance with orders of the regulatory authority. Recently, the UP RERA also authorised the Plumeria Homes Welfare Association to complete remaining development work of Rohtas Plumeria Homes housing project in Gomti Nagar here. The registration of this project was revoked on August 3, 2019, after the promoter violated various regulations of the RERA Act. “The national capital region of Uttar Pradesh has had its share of delays in real estate projects, causing misery and suffering to thousands of homebuyers. Most often these delays are due to promoters failing to fulfill commitments made to homebuyers,” said Rajive Kumar, chairman, UP RERA. According to RERA officials, based on the audit done by consultant Currie & Brown last year, it has come to light that around 40 projects in Gautam Buddh Nagar district have been found as net positive surplus and are viable for completion under this model in future. This approach is ideally suitable for projects where the promoter is keen to complete the project but is unable to do so either due to expiry of registration of the project with the UP RERA or due to differences with the allottees. “The UP RERA is planning to extend this approach to various other projects in the state which are stalled either due an impasse between the promoter and the homebuyers or the completion date (as declared by the promoter) has lapsed, including the one-year extension permissible under section 6 of the RERA Act,” said a RERA official. This process will ensure a quick and lasting solution to the stalled projects and safeguard the interests of homebuyers, he added. Under the banner of Uttar Pradesh Aggrieved Home Buyers’ Rights Association, home buyers from all over the state had decided to analyse all pending housing projects and approach the UP RERA for their completion, said Alok Singh, convenor, Uttar Pradesh Aggrieved Home Buyers’ Rights Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-rera-to-revive-stuck-projects-by-roping-in-rwas-101628791427888.html
12-08-2021||Lucknow||Labs to maintain record of 15-day travel history of people going for Covid tests: Lucknow DM||In the wake of anticipated third wave of the pandemic, the Lucknow district administration has ordered all labs conducting Covid-19 tests to maintain a record of 15-day travel history of people going for the tests.Besides, hotels have been directed to inform the district administration if they come across any tourist from other states.“Contact tracing is the most important aspect when it comes to taking measures to check the virus outbreak. It will be possible only if the department is aware of the travel history of the people. Hence, the labs have been asked to maintain a record of 15-day travel history of those going for Covid tests,” said DM Abhishek Prakash while heading a meeting that he called to check the preparedness in the wake of anticipated third wave of the pandemic. The DM also directed the laboratories to load the data on to government portal compulsorily within 24 hours. “Initially, it was observed that the labs had a laid back approach in uploading the data on the portal. But now they should ensure that both negative and positive reports are uploaded on the portal timely,” he added. Besides, he also emphasised on feeding error-free details of the people going for Covid tests. “Earlier, there were many discrepancies in the data following which the teams had to face immense difficulties in reaching out to the people for contact tracing. Hence, it has been directed to cross check the details being provided by the people at the time of Covid test,” the DM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/labs-to-maintain-record-of-15-day-travel-history-of-people-going-for-covid-tests-lucknow-dm-101628791371572.html
12-08-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC raps state for not registering cases against sub-standard chikki suppliers||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday rapped the state government for not registering a first information report (FIR) against contractors who allegedly supplied sub-standard chikki to state-run schools in 2015. After being informed that the awarding of contracts for supplying chikki was also controversial, the court asked the petitioner to furnish details on whether there was any illegality and procedural lapse in awarding the contracts and whether the contractors were ineligible. The court has directed the state to respond and posted hearing after three weeks. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing public interest litigations (PIL) filed by activist Sandeep Ahire and others, was informed that the PILs filed in 2015 had sought a court-monitored inquiry into the alleged scam wherein sub-standard chikki was distributed to children studying in state-run schools as well as the irregularities in awarding contracts running into crores. The court was also told that an earlier bench of the HC had passed an interim order through which contracts and payments to the contractors were stayed. In 2015, Pankaja Munde, the then state women and child development minister, had come under fire from various quarters for allegedly favouring certain suppliers to provide chikki under Integrated Child Development Scheme by awarding contracts worth ₹206 crore arbitrarily. The issue had worsened after reports emerged that the chikkis were adulterated and not fit for consumption.While making submissions on Thursday, the advocate for petitioners said lab reports of the substandard chikki had shown there was mud and clay in them. He further submitted that nearly 24 contracts amounting to over ₹206 crore had been sanctioned in a day to three contractors without following the process of issuing tenders. The bench was informed that the contracts were awarded in violation of a 1992 state government resolution (GR) which laid down procedures to be followed while awarding contracts. After hearing the submissions, the bench asked the petitioner to give a list of points as to how the procedure of awarding contracts for chikki was not followed. “Focus on procedural aspects and see whether the procedure was as per norms. See whether it was tainted or an illegal contract and if contractors were ineligible. We can go into the question of inferior quality of the product at a later stage,” said the bench. The HC also asked the petitioners and the state to furnish the Central government policy for distributing nutrients to children. When government pleader Priyabhushan Kakade replied that no FIR had been filed against the suppliers of alleged substandard chikki, the court said, “Why are there no offences registered under the Food Safety Act against the suppliers? Your officers are busy filing offences against adulterated pedhas and barfis, why not in this case where children are suffering?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-raps-state-for-not-registering-cases-against-sub-standard-chikki-suppliers-101628791311707.html
12-08-2021||Mumbai||Mandatory full vaccination rule for shops, malls not practical, say Mumbai traders||The state government’s mandate to compulsorily employ fully vaccinated employees in their premises has acted as a spoiler for the shopkeepers, offices and malls. Their contention is, though the move is noble, it is not practical as the state faces an acute shortage of vaccines.The state government, while easing the lockdown restrictions, had announced that all those who are working in shops, offices and malls need to be fully vaccinated and must complete another 14 days after receiving the second dose.The Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industries and Trade (CAMIT), an association of traders and manufacturers termed the order as impractical. “We appreciate the concerns of the government, but at the same time, we need to keep in mind that there is a shortage of vaccines,” said Mohan Gurnani, chairman, CAMIT.Gurnani cited that if anyone has taken his first dose of Covishield in August, he will be getting his second dose in November. In the case of Covaxin, he will have to wait for 28 days and then another 14 days for antibodies to develop before joining work.The Retailers Association of India (RAI), while welcoming the opening of malls, called the vaccination clause regressive. “Majority of the people working in malls are in the age bracket of 18-45 years. How can we resume the operations of the malls if they are not allowed to come to work?” questioned Kumar Rajgopalan, chief executive officer, RAI.Even hotels and restaurants, that are now allowed to operate till 10pm questioned the decision. “Till now, we were allowed to operate till 4pm without our staff getting vaccinated. Now after the extending the timings by six hours, they want us to be fully vaccinated,” rued Amrish Arora, managing director, Fountain Hospitality Private Limited (FHPL), which runs four restaurants including Flamboyante and Fountain Sizzlers, “We are ready to get our staff tested every 15 days,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mandatory-full-vaccination-rule-for-shops-malls-not-practical-say-mumbai-traders-101628791128388.html
12-08-2021||Mumbai||Reduce future chaos on roads, frame parking policy: Bombay HC to state||The Bombay high court (HC) expressed concern over the future of the society if a proper policy for vehicular parking was not made, and warned that there would be utter chaos if the number of vehicles in individual families were not restricted to the parking space owned or available to them, as they end up parking their excess vehicles on the sides of the road outside the building, thus making it difficult for movement of pedestrians and other vehicles. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Navi Mumbai resident and activist Sandeep Thakur, was informed that the petition challenged the government notification which amended the Unified Development Control and Promotion Regulations (UDCPR) Rules, permitting developers from reducing car parking space. Thakur submitted that the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) had relaxed off-street parking norms in favour of developers, as a result of which vehicles owned by flat owners were being parked outside buildings. Thakur sought to quash and set aside the off-street parking provisions framed by NMMC and to restrain NMMC from acting upon the said provisions. After hearing initial submissions, the court expressed anguish at the way in which NMMC had reduced parking space. Referring to the condition of Mumbai, the court said, “We expect the state government to ensure that new and planned cities do not face issues due to illegal on-street parking the like of which we see in Mumbai due to roadside car parking which results in congestion.” The PIL has further claimed that off-street parking regulations have been formulated without any requisite survey, and sought a departmental secretary-level inquiry and urged for suitable action against officials involved in finalising the rules. The petition also sought direction to developers who secured development permissions after December 2, 2020, to make arrangements for off-street parking inside premises of complexes based on provisions prevalent prior to the amended rules being introduced. The bench said that roads were flooded with vehicles and almost 30% of the roads were taken away by vehicles parked on both sides. “These are genuine public concerns which have to be taken into consideration and there is a need to come up with long-term measures so that we do not have a chaotic society. There has to be a policy in place,” said justice Kulkarni. While suggesting ways of reducing new vehicles, the bench said the state could have a policy wherein purchase of new vehicles was allowed only to those who had their own parking space. “Reduction in purchase of new cars is needed. You cannot have four-five cars in a family just because you can afford, unless requisite parking is granted in the premises of society. It was mentioned earlier that the state would make it mandatory for everyone to show parking space before vehicle registration. What is the status of that policy?” the bench asked the state counsel. The bench also suggested that just like Pune had adopted multi-level basement parking in new residential and commercial complexes, Mumbai should also adopt similar measures to ensure that roads are not lined with cars. The court also sought to know about the status of the Mumbai civic boy’s drive to penalise vehicle owners to the tune of ₹10,000 for parking vehicles on the road if there is a dedicated public parking space nearby, and said that it should be implemented strictly. The bench then directed the state to file an affidavit in reply to the petition and the queries raised by the court within two weeks and added that no further extension would be granted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/reduce-future-chaos-on-roads-frame-parking-policy-bombay-hc-to-state-101628790887636.html
12-08-2021||Mumbai||Rise in Delta variants, vaccine shortage main concerns amid relaxation in Maharashtra||Even as Maharashtra government has relaxed Covid-related restrictions, officials from public health department are faced with two main concerns — rise in Delta and Delta Plus cases, and acute shortages of vaccines. Anticipating a third wave, public health experts said these two issues could contribute to aggravating Covid-19 cases. While medical experts have described the relaxations as a ‘calibrated thought’, they are emphasising on robust mass immunisation which is lagging behind due to shortages of vials.Since the start of the second wave in mid-February, the state has sent over 8,000 samples for genome sequencing to identify variants of Sars-CoV-2 — the virus that causes Covid-19. Almost 80% of the samples have tested positive for the Delta variant. On the other hand, Delta Plus (AY.1), a mutation of the highly transmissible Delta variant (B.1.617.2), was detected in the state during the second wave. In June, the Union health ministry declared it as the variant of concern.The number of Delta Plus variant cases increased from 21 in June to 65 in August. At present, the positivity rate of Maharashtra stands at 2.11% which is higher than the national average of 1.34%. Six districts in the state — Beed, Pune, Sangli, Satara, Sindudhurg and Solapur — are still recording seven-day high positivity rates between 7% and 4.6% while the state’s average is 3.3%.The Delta variant is more transmissible while the Delta Plus variant is believed to defeat vaccines and immunity against the infection. Dr Lancelot Pinto, epidemiologist and pulmonologist from Hinduja Hospital, said the Delta Plus variant, in addition to having mutations seen in the Delta variant that renders it potentially more transmissible than the Alpha variant, also possesses the K417N mutation (lysine-arginine in the spike protein).“The concern now is that the presence of this mutation in the Delta Plus variant might render it immune to the antibodies produced by vaccine, past Covid-19 infection or new antibody cocktails used in treatment,” said Pinto. “However, this hasn’t yet been proven and might not necessarily be the case, and the rarity with which the Delta Plus variant has been reported makes it not a variant of concern yet. But we do need to be vigilant and monitor its spread closely.”Priority should be on vaccinationVaccine shortage across the state is hindering the immunisation process. An analysis of the data shows that in the past 11days, the number of inoculation dropped to 3,165,269 compared to 4,670,787 between July 20 and 30.When HT inquired with peripheral civic-run hospitals, many said they do not have vials for the past two days. Dr Pratima Patil, medical superintendent of Shatabdi Hospital in Kandivli, said, “Though people are coming forward to get vaccinated, we can’t inoculate them as we don’t have the stock. We don’t know when we will get vials again.” The situation was similar with Bhagwati Hospital in Borivli and Bhabha Hospital in Kurla. With relaxation in Covid-19 restrictions, medical experts said robust mass immunisation programme is the need of the hour which can help divert the third wave by increasing sero prevalence among citizens. “The available vaccines in India have shown good response to the predominant variant, which is the Delta variant. Data from the United Kingdom also confirmed that Covishield offered them protection from getting severe cases and hospitalisation. So, it is essential that people take both the shots of vaccines for better immunity,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, director of critical care, Fortis Hospital, and member of state’s Covid-19 task force.When asked if it is a reasonable idea to relax the restrictions in a state with over 140 million citizens amid rising cases of Delta variants, Pandit said “Governing bodies have put a lot of thought into this calibrated unlocking. We need to be cognisant, act as responsible citizens, and shoulder the responsibility of wearing double masks despite being vaccinated, and not host social gatherings that could turn into super spreader events. If we adhere to this, unlocking will be smooth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rise-in-delta-variants-vaccine-shortage-main-concerns-amid-relaxation-in-maharashtra-101628790407447.html

The statue was unveiled as part of the programmes under ‘Azaadi Ka Amrit Utsav’ and ‘Chauri Chaura centenary celebrations’. Yogi also inaugurated an exhibition on the life and works of Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna. Speaking on the occasion, he said that Bahuguna’s personality was towering, and he was multifaceted.

Gaikwad was not present at the meeting. The minister told reporters on Thursday that municipal commissioners in urban areas and collectors and Zilla Parishad CEOs in rural areas have been given discretion to take decision. "There is no compulsion (on the state government's part) to reopen schools. The COVID task force members were not aware of our Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). There will be a meeting again. Our (education department's) secretary is studying the SOP of the task force,'' Gaikwad said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-asks-local-officials-to-decide-on-school-reopening-101628790071221.html

The department has directed these individuals to stop further construction on the plot and also asked them to explain by August 17 why no action should be taken and the plot restored to its original condition as per the master plan. RS Bhath, the district town planner (enforcement) said that they had received a complaint that illegal construction of flats had been carried out on a plot on Old Railway road in the revenue estate of Gurugram village without any permission from the department or other agencies. “We had received a complaint based on which an inspection was conducted on Wednesday. We found that around 50 flats were constructed without any permission from authorities. A large number of shops have also been constructed in violation of rules and we have issued a show-cause notice to three persons in this connection,” said Bhath. The notice issued by the enforcement department states that a site inspection was conducted on August 11 following a complaint. “The allegations levelled in the complaint are found correct and the construction work is still going on at the site. It has been found that an unauthorised colony has been carved out in the land situated in kila number 0/1358 in the revenue estate of village Gururgam without any approval/permission from the competent authority,” the notice said. The notice stated that these flats and shops are being sold in violation of the Haryana Urban Development Act of 1975. DTCP officials said that if a satisfactory reply is not received, they will issue a final notice to the violators and initiate action. Over the past month, this is the third such instance where notices were issued to real estate dealers and developers for constructing flats illegally.

A fake identity card, which the suspect allegedly used to avoid paying toll at borders, was recovered from his possession. According to the police, he tried to cross a checkpoint at Atul Kataria Chowk in Sector 14 by flashing the fake identity card.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that one of the policemen on duty signalled the driver of a white Swift to stop, but he tried to accelerate and was boxed in with barricades. “The suspect started abusing the constable. He claimed that he was inspector Prince of the Haryana Police and was on duty. He also threatened to take action against the men on duty. Becoming suspicious, the constable asked him for his identity card, which he handed over to them,” he said. Sangwan said the constable checked the ID card and found it to be fake. “He called his station house officer and informed him about the same. The man was asked to exit the car. When senior officials questioned him, he could not give a satisfactory reply and revealed that he was using a fake identity card of the Haryana Police to avoid paying toll at borders, cross police checkpoints and exert influence,” he said.

The state on Thursday recorded 6,388 cases and 208 deaths. The state’s case tally has now reached 6,375,390, while the toll stands at 134,572.There were 210,675 tests done on Thursday, while the number of recoveries clocked at 8,390. There are currently 62,351 active patients across the state of which Pune tops with 14,423 patients, followed by Sangli with 7,027 active patients and Satara with 6,573.According to Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor, Maharashtra government for Covid-19 management, such easing should be done in a staggered manner. “We should first open with districts having less number of patients and less positivity rate,” said Dr Salunkhe. “These areas should be strictly monitored and in case of any surge in cases, these patients need to be isolated,” he said.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in his Sunday address, had warned the citizens that the pandemic is still not over. He said that people should take care especially during upcoming festival season.From August 15, malls have been given the green signal to open their premises. In addition, hotels and restaurants have been given an extension of timings till 10pm from the previous 4pm. Even weddings in lawns have been allowed with 200 people and in a closed environment, 100 guests or 50% capacity of the hall, whichever is higher.According to Dr Ishwar Gilada, secretary-general, Organised Medicine Academic Guild, the twin approach of mass vaccination and strict action against those who defy the Covid-appropriate behaviour should be adopted by the government. “There is no doubt that the relaxations are necessary, but at the same time, the government needs to deal strictly with those who don’t obey the rules and endanger the lives of other people,” said Dr Gilada. “If there is a shortage of vaccines, then the vulnerable section should be vaccinated first,” he added.Meanwhile, on Thursday, Mumbai clocked 281 new Covid-19 cases with seven deaths.

He was commenting on the issue of schools re-opening in the cities. Fadnavis also accused the state government of indecisiveness in decision making, leading to confusion in combatting the Covid pandemic. Fadnavis was in Thane and Navi Mumbai on Thursday to attend various events. He claimed the government is misleading citizens on the Maratha reservation issue, which it wants to delay till the local body elections in the state. Responding to a query about the ongoing confusion over the reopening of school in Maharashtra, Fadnavis said, “I think there is no coordination between the state government, the ministers and the task force, which leads to confusion among the students as well as their parents.” Fadnavis added, “The decision-making process of the state government is not up to the mark. There is a lot of confusion. A minister says that schools will start in the state and the next day it is reported that the task force is against it. There is obviously a lack of coordination among the departments. The state government needs to get its act right and plan efficiently to face future hurdles.” Accusing the state government of misleading on the Maratha reservation issue, Fadnavis said, “Unless there is a census, the OBCs cannot be declared and unless that happens reservation cannot happen. The government has not initiated any process for it as yet, and is indulging in blame game despite the Central government clearing all hurdles.” He claimed that the state government is deliberately delaying the local body elections. Castigating the state minister Nitin Raut and Congress for raising the issue of atrocities on women in Uttar Pradesh he said, “There are atrocities on women, especially from the economically weaker sections in Maharashtra every day. How many of them have Nitin Raut met, extended help or condemned the incident.” Citing several instances in the state, he said, “I have a very long list of such cases and there has been inaction in several cases.” (Inputs from Gautam S Mengle)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-coordination-between-maharashtra-government-ministers-task-force-alleges-fadnavis-101628788967285.html

12-08-2021||Kolkata||Bring back cycles on Kolkata roads: Ruskin Bond among others appeal to Mamata||Several prominent personalities, including a Trinamool Congress parliamentarian and authors, made an appeal to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee to lift the ban on cycling from 64 arterial roads in Kolkata.Terming the West Bengal government's ban unjustified, SwitchON Foundation, a not-for-profit group, that launched a campaign #BringBackCycles, said in an open letter to chief minister Mamata Banerjee that cycles are not only zero-emission transportation but also enables livelihoods and reduces congestion in the city.The West Bengal government in consultation with Kolkata Police had in 2014 banned cycling on 64 major thoroughfares of the capital city Kolkata, including Camac Street, Shakespeare Sarani, Mahatma Gandhi Road, citing safety hazards and pace of vehicular movement on arterial roads.The letter, signed by eminent personalities such photojournalist Raghu Rai, actor-film director Aparna Sen, archer Rahul Banerjee Archer, Trinamool MP Saugata Roy, iconic singer Usha Uthup, filmmaker Anupam Roy, economist Jean Dreze, oncologist Dr Suman Mallick, actor Anindya Chatterjee, sportsperson Dola Banerjee, journalist and human rights activist Sumanta Banerjee, pointed that the traffic cops of Kolkata Police enforcing the ban are themselves highly susceptible to respiratory ailments due to air pollution, which further increases chances of morbidity from the Covid-19.Vinay Jaju, the founder of SwitchON Foundation, which also started the Bengal Clean Air Network, said, "Ironically, those who have implemented the cycling ban, are themselves most vulnerable to air pollution as per a study."The study, titled 'Evaluation of the impact of ambient air pollution on respiratory health of traffic police in Kolkata', by researchers from Sister Nibedita Government General Degree College for Girls, Kolkata and the University of Kalyani, found high levels of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) behind reduced lung function, especially among police personnel in north Kolkata followed by south and central zones.A total of 228 police personnel participated in the study of which 128 undertook pulmonary lung function tests. Researchers found that traffic constables were at a higher risk group, likely to develop respiratory dysfunctions. PM 2.5 and PM 10 were found to be associated with decreasing respiratory and cardiovascular health of traffic police, leading to the risk of death. The survey also showed many traffic cops with restrictions of lung expansion, obstruction, and narrowing airways.“From the study, we found PM 2.5 and PM 10 are key polluting agents in Kolkata. Although ambient air quality varies across locations and with seasons, traffic cops working were found to be seriously vulnerable due to long term exposure,” said Dr Subhashis Sahu, associate professor and the head of the department of physiology at the University of Kalyani, who also co-authored the study.The letter also found support from legendary author Ruskin Bond and novelist Amitav Ghosh, who is also known for his literary works focussing on climate change and human migration, as well as actor Dia Mirza, cricketer Varun Aaron, Indian documentary filmmaker Anand Patwardhan, senior advocate Justice Anjana Prakash, Mahatma Gandhi's great-grandson Tushar Gandhi, and activist Aruna Roy.“Cycles are making a comeback in cities across the world. They don’t pollute the atmosphere. They don’t cause traffic jams. We need them in Kolkata and every other town and city," Ruskin Bond said.Dr Sahu explained that traffic police personnel working especially in central Kolkata frequently complain of poor respiratory health. “The longer exposure to a polluted environment causes more impairment of pulmonary function parameters,” he said, adding that for improvement of air quality, less polluting transportation such as cycles was key.Kolkata has been grappling with severe air pollution and ranks 25th among the 1,000 most-polluted cities globally, as per a 2019 report by the World Health Organization.Vinay said his organisation has appealed to the commissioner of Kolkata Police to lift the ban and help implement a cycle safe infrastructure for Kolkata. “We have already addressed the issues inhibiting them from having a cycle track in and around the city. This is why we consulted a wide range of mobility experts from across the country who were in favour of keeping cycling at the centre of the mobility planning for sustainable development in cities,” he said.Trinamool Congress MP and a close aide of Mamata Banerjee, Saugata Roy, said, “I am all for cycles. I want cycles back on the roads of Kolkata. This would reduce pollution and save fuel. All over Europe, cycles are a new rage. Let cycles come back. Our party MPs went by cycle to Parliament on the first day of the Monsoon session.”Echoing him, Padma Shri awardee singer Usha Uthup who even created a cycling song in her own unique style to support the campaign shared that it took a lockdown in the entire country to make people fall in love with cycles once again making them extremely popular.“Today the youth are back on the roads cycling, not only for their health but also for the health of the city. Bicycles are the need of the hour across lanes and bylanes of the city under the Kolkata police’s jurisdiction. Zero restrictions and infrastructure support promoting cycling will help city residents to start commuting short distances using cycles, which will eventually pave the way for commuters to look at this as a recognised mode of transport. In the long run, bicycles will help us stay fit, ensure we have fun, and also breathe clean air by cutting down on vehicular pollution,” she said.Former additional director of Central Pollution Control Board, Dipankar Saha said that the vehicular emissions in Kolkata are a significant contributor to deteriorating ambient air quality. "The city needs dedicated infrastructure to support cycling such as a bicycle corridor to ensure that citizens focus on non-polluting mobility that improves one's health and physical well being. No bicycle track should be constructed along vehicular lanes with busy traffic. As far as possible, bicycle lanes should be considered along with the greens, forest etc which will definitely increase health criteria," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-banerjee-kolkata-cycling-ban-revocation-air-pollution-open-letter-101628774330205.html

The residents and members of the industrial estate will tomorrow meet Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials, including municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar, solid waste management department head Ajeet Deshmukh, and additional municipal commissioner (estate) Kunal Khemnar with proof that the garbage is being dumped inside the estate by trucks belonging to the PMC itself.Residents and members of Ramtekdi Industrial Estate were forced to take such action after they did not get any response despite writing several times to the PMC solid waste department about the alleged garbage dumping inside the estate. According to Shenaz Chawla of Pune Waste Warriors, a non-profit committed to cleaning up India, “There is continuous dumping of garbage which has accumulated to mountainous proportions, which is very destructive and hazardous for the industrial estate.” The only good outcome of the constant complaints was to bring citizens together to help catch the PMC in the action of dumping garbage on live CCTV footage. According to citizens, the amount of garbage brought in trucks is never-ending with almost 40,000 tonne of garbage having accumulated inside the estate.The industrial estate has over 140 companies and there are also some residences nearby that are affected by the garbage dumping. Rajesh Bhojwani, who owns a unit in the estate said, “We had a meeting with Vikram Kumar who stated the problems but was also very constructive and suggested constituting a citizen and civic body engagement association to help arrive at a solution. We have that meeting tomorrow where we will show the officials proof that despite their claims that not a single vehicle is dumping garbage, the reality is quite the opposite.”The estate also houses the corporation-approved Rochem unit that was installed a decade ago to generate electricity from waste however estate residents and members allege that they have never really seen it working.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ramtekdi-industrial-estate-members-to-meet-pmc-with-proof-of-garbage-dumping-101628785606497.html

They are blaming the Maharashtra State Electricity Development Corporation Limited (MSEDCL) for its lackadaisical approach as their situation is worsening despite repeated complaints. Forced to deal with physical inconvenience, water shortages and loss of business due to the outages, residents have threatened to intensify their agitation and not pay electricity bills if their problems remain unsolved. Meanwhile, MSEDCL officials are claiming that they have resolved the residents’ difficulties.Sunil Deshmukh, a resident of Krupashrushti society, said, “For the past fortnight, we are facing irregular power supply. There are 40 bungalows and 100 families in our society. At a time when education has gone online and most people are working from home following pandemic restrictions, interrupted power supply is extremely annoying. Sometimes, there are up to three power cuts within an hour…”Mahendra Kolhe, a resident of Blue Spring society of Jambhulwadi, said, “Our children have been unable to regularly attend online classes for the past one week. Work and classes are going awry due to the power cuts. We have to go to our relatives’ homes for our children’s online classes.”Dhanashri Patil, a resident of Dattanagar area of Jambhulwadi, said, “My older daughter is a software engineer and has been working from home but her work gets hampered. My younger daughter is in Class 10 and faces problems with online studies. It is difficult to even get water on time in the society.”Deepak Sargar, a resident of Gujarwadi road area of Katraj said, “Whenever we call the MSEDCL office, we get stereotypical replies that work is underway and that there is a fault in the underground cable and it will take time.”Sanjay Ghodke, additional executive engineer of the Dhanakawadi sub-division of MSEDCL, said, “There was a problem of interrupted power in Dattanagar and Bharat nagar area of Katraj but it has been solved. Due to an underground cable fault, there were frequent power cuts in this area. The urban areas are expanding and the old cables cannot take the additional load. So we changed the underground cables. An underground cable fault takes more time to identify as compared to overhead cables. However, we are trying to solve the problem as early as possible.”“Narrow lanes and unavailability of space for installation of transformers are some of the hurdles in the way of uninterrupted power supply. The Pune Municipal Corporation has given an assurance to provide space for transformers and other electricity-related utilities,” Ghodke said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/katraj-residents-see-red-over-frequent-power-cuts-101628785246448.html

The same applies to those who commute regularly between Pune and Lonavala and Daund junction.A K Singh, senior public relations officer, central railway, said, “Let Mumbai restart its local train services and see how the protocols laid down by the state Government work from August 15. We will wait to see the response and then take a call after the government gives us the nod.”Thackeray had announced that fully vaccinated commuters who had completed the 14-day period after their second dose of the covid-19 vaccine would be able to procure special railway passes on a specially-created application (app) on their smartphones.Manoj Jhawar, Pune public relations officer, central railway, further said, “Ever since Mumbai announced resuming local train services for fully vaccinated commuters, there is a lot of speculation from around 4,000 daily commuters to and from Mumbai and Daund. But till the state government takes a call, we cannot do anything about it. During the coronavirus pandemic, only eight trains were allowed between Pune and Lonavala, that too for essential services, owing to Covid restrictions.”New coach for DQ on Independence Day On the occasion of Independence Day on August 15, a new coach will be added to the iconic train, the Mumbai-Pune Deccan Queen. Responding to commuters’ suggestions, the central railway has fitted an end coach – a wide window dome one – to the Pune end of the train for an unrestricted view of the ghats.The Deccan Queen is the second train on the central railway to get a vista dome coach with the first being the Deccan Express which has seen a very good response from commuters. The 34-seater fully air-conditioned vista dome coach has a large trailing window in the rear, huge side windows for panoramic views, a top made of see-through glass, and 180 degree swivel chairs for an unparalleled viewing experience. A one-way reserved ticket in this coach costs Rs915.

As per district health officials, these talukas have reported less immunisation due to the rise in Covid cases in the past few months. With the threat of a third wave of Covid, routine immunisation among children is important, officials noted. Velhe, Ambegaon, Purandar, Bhor, Junnar, Indapur, Baramati in Pune district have reported less than 21 per cent full Immunisation for children as of June 31, 2020.Speaking about the numbers, district health officer Bhagwan Pawar said that the target for each taluka every month is eight per cent.“Likewise, till June end, the total immunisation in each taluka should be around 25 percent. By August end, it should be 33 percent,” said Dr Pawar.While routine immunisation for children is important, it will help us strengthen the fight against Covid, said officials.Dr Sachin Edke, district immunisation officer, said that due to the rise in Covid cases, many on-ground workers were not able to meet the targets.“They are now being directed to identify how many children are left out and to complete a door-to-door survey. Regular immunisation camps will help cover the required number of beneficiaries,” said Dr Edke.“To fight against the third wave of Covid, full Immunisation of children between the age group of zero to five years is important. We have directed the primary healthcare centres to conduct regular immunisation camps. If some children are left out, door-to-door immunisation will help with the coverage,” said Dr Edke.He added that officials in the respective blocks are instructed to complete the coverage targets by the end of August.Along with Pune district, other districts also reported a similar situation.

12-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai records first death from Delta Plus Covid-19 variant||The city has recorded its first death due to the Delta Plus variant of Covid-19. A 63-year-old woman patient who was fully vaccinated, according to the civic body, succumbed to the infection. The Delta Plus (AY.1) is a mutation of the highly transmissible Delta variant of Sars-CoV-2 (B.1.617.2) and was detected in the state during the devastating second wave. In June, the union health ministry declared it as variant of concern.According to initial information provided by the civic health officials, the deceased patient was a resident of the eastern suburbs. She had several comorbidities, including diabetes. She was one of seven patients in the city who recently tested positive for the Delta Plus variant. According to a civic official, the patient, who was vaccinated with Covishield, was detected with Covid-19 on July 21. She had dry cough, loss of taste and body ache. She was admitted to ICU on July 24. She was on oxygen support and was administered steroids and remdesivir, but died on July 27. “The patient had lung disease and obstructive airway disease, for which she was taking oxygen treatment at home before the Covid-19 infection. She didn’t have any travel history,” said an official. Six of her family members have also been found Covid-19 positive. Two of them have been detected with the Delta Plus variant after genome sequencing. The death takes the state’s toll due to Delta Plus to two. Last month, an 80-year-old woman from Ratnagiri became the first Covid-19 patient in the state to succumb to the with Delta Plus variant of the infection. The senior citizen died on June 13 and her genome sequencing report, which identified her as infected with AY.1, was submitted to the state health department on June 20.At present, the total figure of Delta Plus variants in Mumbai has increased to 11 from one in June. Of the latest seven patients identified with Delta Plus variant, three were fully vaccinated, while one had only taken the first shot. “Majority of the seven newly identified patients belong to the 17-38 common age group. All seven are female,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Amid growing cases of Delta Plus in the state, which currently stands at 65, medical experts stressed the need to ramp up vaccination. “What experience from across the world has consistently shown us is that when rates of vaccination are high, even if variants cause surges in infections, such infections tend to be of a milder nature and do not cause hospitalisations or deaths on a large scale. We also need to do our best to limit crowds, as overcrowding has consistently led to spread over the past 18 months,” said Dr Lancelot Pinto, a pulmonologist and epidemiologist from Hinduja Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-first-death-from-delta-plus-covid-19-variant-101628784167104.html

Of 20 fresh cases of the delta-plus variant detected on Wednesday, three are from Pune district. State officials said that of 65 cases so far, 33 are from the age group of 18 to 45 years.Genome sequencing for these cases is done by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB).Of these, three cases are from Pune district and three from Thane district. The maximum number of cases were found in Jalgaon district, where 13 people tested positive, while 12 tested positive in Ratnagiri district and 11 in Mumbai. Three patients tested positive in Palghar. Nanded, Gondia and Raigad district reported two cases each. Chandrapur, Akola, Sindhudurg, Sangli, Nandurbar, Aurangabad, Kolhapur and Beed reported one patient, each taking the total to 65 cases.Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer said that in districts where the delta-plus variant has been found, information about the patients is being collected and patients are being monitored closely.“There is an increase, but the increase in the number of patients is not that high. Delta-plus and delta variant cases are reported because there is a detailed sequencing of tests done. We have so far tested 10,000 samples through genome sequencing and only 65 have tested positive for the delta-plus variant,” said Dr Awate.He added that contact tracing is also carried out for delta-plus variants. “As per a memorandum of understanding (MoU), signed by Maharashtra state and IGIB, genome sequencing on 100 samples from each district is to be done every month,” said Awate.Post the genome sequencing, 80 per cent of cases are positive for delta variants. “And 65 individual samples have been tested positive for the delta-plus variant,” said Awate.Speaking about the delta and delta-plus variant, Dr Dnyaneshwar Mote, member of the Pune city Covid task force for Social Action said that the virus will have variants.“These variants are more contagious than other variants. The situation is getting worse worldwide and India should be alert. To tackle the situation, the best solution is to fully vaccinate the population. As more people are vaccinated, there will be increased immunity, which will stop the virus from mutating into further dangerous variants,” said Mote.BoxDelta-plus Covid variant Fresh cases as of August 12Mumbai - 7Pune - 3Nanded, Gondia, Palghar and Raigad -- 2Chandrapur and Akola -- 1Total fresh cases -- 20Total cases so far -- 65||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/3-fresh-cases-of-delta-plus-variant-in-pune-district-101628783806447.html

After the latest round of relaxations being implemented in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad from Monday, restaurants are allowed dine-ins till 10 pm. Shops, malls, gyms, salons, beauty parlours, and spas are allowed to operate till 8 pm. The state government’s latest order, effective August 15 throughout Maharashtra, allows shops and malls to also operate till 10 pm. Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar said that the matter would be discussed at the weekly review meeting. “At the weekly Covid review meeting this particular matter will be discussed,” said Vikram Kumar. Business operators from various sectors, especially malls and gyms, feel that it would be beneficial to have a closing timing of 10pm. “Pre-Covid, we used to have batches till 10pm and many used to come to gyms directly from offices and then go home. Now, mostly people are working from home and have to work till late evening. So if we are allowed to operate till 10pm then more people would be able to join,” said Nilesh Kale, president, Pune Fitness Club Association. Mall operators also shared the same thought. “We welcome the decision to extend timings. Especially the food and beverage operators who would hope to get more patrons during this time,” said Mahesh M, chief executive officer (CEO), Creaticity Mall, Pune. He also added that the precondition of allowing only fully vaccinated people in malls will discourage those with a single jab. “With all safety and hygiene protocols in place and with plenty of outdoor and open spaces, we are well suited to provide the ideal environment for shopping and dining, but we are looking forward to further relaxations soon,” said Mahesh M. Representatives of the traders’ association however said that they are comfortable with the 8pm deadline for now. “In the main market of Pune, late afternoon and evening are peak hours. Customers usually come till 8-8.30 pm. So the current closing timing of 8 pm is fine now,” said Mahendra Pitaliya, secretary, Federation of Trade Association of Pune (FTAP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/decision-on-10pm-deadline-for-pune-will-be-taken-at-covid-review-meet-civic-chief-101628783506375.html

The BJP is organising Jan Aashirwad Yatras for its newly inducted union Cabinet ministers across the country. Thirty-nine ministers who joined the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s new Cabinet in last month’s reshuffle will hold massive rallies in their respective states.“The yatra will seek to inform people about the achievements of the BJP-led union government and programmes aimed at boosting employment through its focus on self-reliance,” said BJP Bihar president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal while talking to mediapersons on Thursday. Also Read | Bihar Cabinet greenlights Panduka bridge, to be made by 2024In the first week of July after the split in LJP, party leader Chirag Paswan embarked on an Aashirwad Yatra in Bihar, while JD (U) leader Upendra Kushwaha started a Bihar Yatra on July 10. Paswan’s uncle and union minister Pashupati Kumar Paras is also scheduled to start an Abhar Yatra from his parliamentary constituency Hajipur on August 16. BJP leaders said that through this yatra, the party wants to portray that the Modi government is giving representation to weaker sections and various communities, especially at a time when regional parties in Bihar have made caste census an issue. “On July 8, the Modi Cabinet expanded and for the first time in the history of India, 27 backward people got to participate in the government of India. For the first time, there are 12 scheduled caste ministers and eight scheduled tribe ministers in the union Cabinet,” said Jaiswal. There are six ministers from Bihar in the union Cabinet.“The yatra will start on August 19 from Gaya and culminate at Ara on August 21. During this period, union minister RK Singh will address a gathering of intellectuals in each of the districts while deputy CM Tar Kishore Prasad will join the yatra at Ara,” said the BJP state president.

12-08-2021||Mumbai||Follow Mumbai’s home vax module, HC asks civic bodies across Maharashtra||Expressing satisfaction at the progress of home vaccination drive in Mumbai and other municipal areas in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the Bombay high court (HC) has asked other municipal corporations in the state to consider replicating the home vaccination module of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) within their limits.The HC was informed that the BMC had inoculated 1,317 bedridden and immobile individuals of the 4,889 registered persons without any incidence of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) till August 9. The drive was started on a pilot basis on July 30 in the K-East ward. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while perusing the affidavit filed by the BMC and submissions made by the petitioner advocate Dhruti Kapadia observed, “This figure constitutes roughly 25% of total registered beneficiaries. The encouraging part is that none of the persons vaccinated had any AEFI. We record our satisfaction that the BMC has been moving in the right direction. We expect the corporation to cover more such bedridden individuals in the days to come.” The petitioner advocate Kapadia who along with advocate Kunal Tiwari had filed the public interest litigation (PIL) seeking directions to the Centre, state and BMC to initiate door-to-door vaccination for people aged above 75 years, the disabled and the bedridden while addressing the court on Thursday submitted that she was happy with the way the drive was going and urged the court to direct BMC to include people above 75 and 80 years in the scheme as well. Kapadia, however, submitted that the affidavit filed by the BMC on August 10 responding to the queries of the court on the number of people provided jabs at home and the role of NGOs that had been roped in was not clear and hence the BMC should clarify. The BMC affidavit stated that the NGOs would provide support to the teams conducting home vaccination by calling beneficiaries prior to the visit of the team as well as do a follow up with the beneficiary after the jab was administered. The court observed, “With respect to the nature of support received from NGOs, presently there is nothing on record precluding the corporation from taking help from NGOs to administer vaccines.” Additional government pleader Geeta Shastri for the state submitted that the suggestions furnished by Kapadia on providing a helpline and introducing biometrics for beneficiaries without proper documents had been forwarded to the state Covid task force for consideration. Shastri assured the HC that once the task force considers them, appropriate action will be taken to implement the approved suggestions for the benefit of the class of people. The court also took on record the submissions by Kapadia that Mira-Bhayander Municipal Corporation and Thane Municipal Corporation had also started home vaccination in their jurisdiction and said, “We encourage other corporations of this state to initiate measures for home vaccination of bedridden individuals following the same pattern adopted by BMC.” The court then asked the state and other authorities to inform it about further developments based on its directives and posted further hearing of the PIL on September 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/follow-mumbai-s-home-vax-module-hc-asks-civic-bodies-across-maharashtra-101628775046705.html

12-08-2021||Pune||Taste of life: True story about a chef, sexism and kitchen politics, all in Pune 90 years ago||I met Narhar Shivram Gadre in the summer of 2015. He was 92 then and lived with his unmarried grandson in a single room in an old wada near the erstwhile Prabhat Talkies. I was trying to trace the whereabouts of a gentleman who ran a small eatery in Appa Balwant chowk. This eatery exclusively sold misal and had shut down in the late 1970s. A shopkeeper who knew Gadre well directed me to him that evening.Gadre had been a cook in a couple of famous restaurants in the 1940s. He did not remember anything about the joint which sold misal near his house, but he knew of a few others. Would you please tell me more about those restaurants, I had asked him. He asked me my surname, and satisfied, proceeded to tell me about them. I had heard about most of them earlier. Their owners, menus, and chairs – everything seemed familiar when Gadre narrated anecdotes of his visits to those places in his younger days.What about the restaurants where you worked, I asked him. I do not remember much, he said.A few weeks later, I visited him unannounced again. I requested him to tell me about his experience as a cook at the restaurants. He was hesitant this time too. I persisted. He asked me my surname, went silent for a minute, and then started to narrate the story of his life.He was 12 when he came to Pune from Deolali near Nasik. His father had passed away, and he had to earn a living for his mother and two younger siblings. One of his father’s friends in Pune took him to a restaurant in Budhwar peth and requested the owner, Mr Deodhar, to employ him. Deodhar owned two restaurants in the city at the time that were famous for the misal they served.Gadre started by washing plates and cleaning tables at the restaurant. He was a quick learner. He would observe the cook make chivda, ghavan (soft, thin pancakes made of rice flour), and usal (legume curry). Deodhar had been observing the young boy. Impressed with Gadre’s honesty and intelligence, he decided to enrol him in a school. It was decided that Gadre would attend the school for five hours daily and spend the rest of his time working at the restaurant.In a couple of years, Gadre started assisting the main cook, and by the time he was 19 and ready to enrol in a college, he had learned all the skills to be the chief cook. Deodhar promised him that he would start another branch of his restaurant and appoint him as the manager after he got a degree. Gadre never went to college. On August 8, 1942, Gandhi launched the Quit India Movement in Bombay, and many students took to the streets after dropping out of schools and colleges. Gadre was arrested briefly after participating in a protest march on August 11 near SP College. He was released three months later.He worked in Deodhar’s restaurants after that for another four years before they were shut down. He could have easily been employed in another restaurant, but decided not to be a cook anymore. He enjoyed cooking, but also wanted to study further and earn a living as a clerk in a government office. He wanted society to treat him with respect. Being a cook meant that he had no social status. Gadre realised this when he could not find an educated girl to marry him. He was ridiculed for aspiring to marry a girl who could read and write.Food and cooking is an area that has followed strict gendered patterns, markedly dependent on a division between professional and domestic spaces. Professional gastronomy has long been a man’s world, defined by great masculine figures and built upon “masculine” values of toughness, strength, and discipline. By defining domestic cooking as a feminine task, men strengthened their domination over women. Conversely, in the public sphere, men used cooking to earn money. As breadwinners, men used cooking to control the participation of women in the public sphere as both customers and cooks.The political and social discourse centering on nationalism in the early and mid-20th century Maharashtra strengthened gender stereotypes and gender hierarchies. Wielding a whisk, wok or spoon affected the social status of a male. Cooking for Maharashtrian men was a means of breadwinning rather than a calling or an artistic and creative occupation. Men either cooked at weddings or during religious rituals, or in restaurants. Male cooks were looked down upon and followed a hierarchy where the ones employed in restaurants were given a lower status than those who cooked at weddings. In Europe, the professional chef was associated with professionalism and pride of cooking as a masculine tradition with its great masters. The male chef was seen as antithetical to the female model concerning cooking: the housewife. She was associated with traditional values of domestic cooking, family, and food that oriented with a care-for-others role.This dichotomy hardly existed in Maharashtra where male chefs who cooked to earn a living were considered “feminine”. Society saw food-related activities as a female pursuit because cooking, for men, did not come as a natural obligation. Hence, men who cooked for money were deemed unworthy to fit into the nationalist model of a strong, ruthless, patriotic male.It was too early for society to consider that gender was a social construct, a continuum, and stereotypes were created. Men suffered social expectations to behave accordingly to the then male stereotype, which most of them chose to conform to.Gadre taught himself to use a typewriter and worked with an insurance company for the rest of his life. He married a girl who could read and write and had four children. He helped his wife in the kitchen. The family rarely visited restaurants since it was looked at with disdain. Gadre instead cooked misal and sabudana wada at home. He passed away last year due to Covid-19.Chinmay Damle is a research scientist and food enthusiast. He writes here on Pune’s food culture.

The BMC also noted that no adverse reaction was observed in any beneficiaries. The door-to-door vaccination was implemented as a pilot project in Mumbai on July 30.Following this, a division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni said that the BMC was moving in the right direction on the door-to-door vaccination programme. “This statement is very encouraging.

The petition said that such people would not be able to go to vaccination centres.Earlier, the centre had not introduced the door-to-door vaccination drive citing vaccine wastage and the risk of adverse reactions. However, the Maharashtra state government in July said that it would begin the programme and also formulated a policy for its implementation following which the drive started in Mumbai as a pilot project.Meanwhile, the court has posted the plea for further hearing on September 9.

During the last assembly bypolls on three seats, Raje’s photo was missing from hoarding and posters. A BJP leader then said only CM, Leader of the Opposition, and state party chief photo can be used on posters. Raje’s short tour of the state created a buzz in the state BJP. While many in the party believed that her aerial survey to flood-affected areas has brought the Opposition BJP on centre stage, few also believe that the visit was to strengthen her personal image. “Raje is our leader and her visit certainly benefits the party,’ said a BJP MLA on the condition of anonymity. Political analyst Manish Godha said Raje’s aerial tour to flood-affected areas and her statement on poster row indicate her return to action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/never-cared-about-being-on-posters-says-raje-on-row-in-rajasthan-101628762014411.html

12-08-2021||Patna||Bihar writes to Centre over teachers’ involvement in midday meal scheme||The viral video of a Bihar government school teacher selling gunny bags used for midday meal foodgrains, and is subsequent suspension, has again brought into focus the need to dissociate teachers from additional responsibilities like midday meals (MDM). Bihar education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said he has written to the Centre and raised the issue during his meeting with Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan recently, as it would become all the more demanding [for the teachers] under the new education policy (NEP), which also proposes nutritional breakfast to children in addition to MDM. “The additional breakfast scheme was to be implemented from April 1, 2021, but could not happen due to Covid. It is a good move, but if teachers will be engaged with breakfast and meal, the real objective will be lost,” he said, adding that Bihar has been advocating for longer involvement of parents through direct benefit transfer or public distribution system (PDS) to spare teachers non-academic work. Also Read | Bihar Cabinet greenlights Panduka bridge, to be made by 2024Maintaining that teachers remaining involved with meals and preparing vouchers would have an adverse impact on educational atmosphere and quality, he said the schools would end up being a ‘bhojshala’, not ‘pathshala’ (canteen nor school). ”Under the NEP, it is all the more necessary to disassociate teachers completely from MDM. The task should be handed over to an independent body. Everyone talks of quality in government schools, but for that, the teachers would have to be spared,” he added. The minister said that the government has signed an agreement with Akshay Patra Foundation of ISCON for MDM in Patna schools on a trial basis. “If this works out, we will try to extend it in other districts also by developing a working system group and involving Jeevika volunteers and other local agencies. Providing meals to around 74,000 schools is a huge task,” he added. Earlier, the state also tried to hand over the responsibility of supplying MDM to children in one block each of Muzaffarpur and Jehanabad districts to Jeevika self-help group (SHGs) as a pilot project. Bihar has over 1.5 million women self-help groups. However, this is not the first time the state saddled teachers with extra work. A few years ago, the government asked teachers to visit urban wards and panchayat committees of Muzaffarpur and Aurangabad to stop people from defecating in the open. That caused such a furore that the order had to be withdrawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-writes-to-centre-over-teachers-involvement-in-midday-meal-scheme-101628759194328.html
12-08-2021||Other||Nagaland: Commission on register of indigenous inhabitants submits recommendations||Two years after the Nagaland government’s proposed enumeration of the state’s indigenous population viz. Register of Indigenous Inhabitants of Nagaland (RIIN) drew flak from various quarters, including tribal bodies and the civil society, forcing the government to immediately constitute a commission to examine the issues and submit recommendations, the commission’s report was finally tabled during the recently concluded Monsoon Session of the state assembly.The commission on RIIN, led by former chief secretary Banuo Z Jamir, held a series of consultations with tribal organisations, the civil society and NGOs, and submitted its report to the state government in 2019. However, the report was only presented in the assembly on the persistence of the Opposition Naga People’s Front members.What is RIIN?RIIN has its roots in the state government’s decision in 2019 to implement Inner Line Permit (ILP) under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation Act of 1873 throughout Dimapur district, which was erroneously or ignorantly overlooked for over 40 years. The ILP is an official travel document issued by the state government, which allows inward travel of foreigners and Indian citizens of other states into Nagaland for a limited period.The state government issued a notification on November 21, 1979 declaring the then Dimapur sub- division under Kohima district a tribal belt, making Dimapur eligible for ILP, but this fact curiously surfaced only after the state government decided on November 1979 as the cut-off month and year for identification of indigenous inhabitants for RIIN. as it recognises the state to adopt protective measures for its indigenous inhabitants (viz. Naga tribes, Kuki, Kachari, Garo and MIkirs).Also Read | Nagaland Oppn, ruling PDA to come together for united governmentRIIN was initiated in 2019 after a state government committee recommended the creation of such a registry primarily to prevent issuance of fake “indigenous inhabitant” certificates, which is one of the main reasons for influx of illegal immigrants in the state. Also, due to wrongly issued indigenous inhabitant certificates meant for recognised scheduled tribes of the state, many ineligible persons were reported to have enjoyed privileges that were meant for indigenous inhabitants, such as availing job opportunities based on 100% reservation of all non-technical and 80% reservation of all other posts in the state, availing scholarships and seats for professional and technical studies, loans etc.Claims that some illegal immigrants took citizenship by other means gradually ushered in a general feeling of xenophobia, particularly towards illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. While the government decided to find out who is indigenous and who is not; what was thought to be a simple exercise--RIIN--once it was notified on 29th June 2019 along with proposed process, instantly became a topic of public debate.Taking note of the issues raised in subsequent consultative meetings with the stakeholders, the government set up the Banuo Z Jamir commission on July 27, 2019, which was given three months time to submit its findings and recommendations.The commission asserted that while it took consideration of diverse opinions on the matter, it was its firm stand that December 1, 1963--the date Nagaland gained statehood--was to be taken as the cut-off date to decide the eligibility of a person to be an inhabitant of Nagaland, whether the person is indigenous, a tribal non-indigenous to Nagaland or a non-tribal.Who is eligible to be an indigenous inhabitant of Nagaland?Any person belonging to one of the notified 18 tribes of Nagaland – 14 Naga tribes and four non-Naga tribes (Kuki, Kachari, Garo and Mikir) residing in his/her native village or in any other village or town in Nagaland or elsewhere, provided he or she has not acquired citizenship of another country. Also, the person’s antecedent in the native village should be traced back for not less than two generations beyond December 1, 1963.With the view to ensure that authentication of the identity of an individual is carried out without influence or manipulation, the commission recommended that information furnished for each individual should be first verified at the family level in the village, followed by confirmation from clan and khel, before the village council certifies the document, which would further be submitted to the deputy commissioner.Who is eligible to be a Permanent Resident of Nagaland?The state government projected that the RIIN master list, once created, will ensure that no one will be able to manipulate the system to create fake and fraudulent indigenous inhabitant certificates. Side by side, the government, while ensuring identification of all the genuine indigenous inhabitants of the state, will also compile a list of those who have settled in Nagaland pre-statehood ( December 1, 1963) and recognise them as “permanent residents” of the state, with few other criteria.The commission recommended that a panel be made responsible for authenticating the members belonging to various other communities.LegislationThe commission recommended that the state government consider enactment of a legislation so as to bring the entire exercise and execution of RIIN and issuance of indigenous inhabitant certificate (IIC) and permanent resident certificate (PRC) to genuine persons, through a statutory law.Other recommendationsIn the process of interactions, consultations and study of issues, the commission stated to have observed several areas of concern, though they relate to matters outside the terms of reference, it nonetheless made few recommendations to be taken into consideration. These include the need for the state government to prepare a brief write up on RIIN and registry of permanent resident (RPR) for general information to enhance the transparency of the entire exercise. It also maintained that the government needed to come clean on the position of RIIN/RPR set against the Citizenship Amendment Bill and the National Register of Citizens in Assam.It also asserted that the government ought to make it clear that the objective of RIIN is an exercise to authenticate the identity of a person belonging to a village that is already established/recognised and not to authenticate or accord recognition to a community.The commission further recommended that land laws need to be tightened as the practice of transfer of land and mutation of patta in favour of non-tribals on the basis of indigenous inhabitants certificates were detected and speak of either ignorance or land laws of the state.The commission specifically noted an instance of a chairman of a village council belonging to a tribe not indigenous to Nagaland. Therefore, it recommended that the prescribed qualification to be a member of a village council under the Nagaland Village and Tribal Councils Act 1978 be suitably amended by incorporating “indigenous inhabitant” as an additional condition.For tribals not indigenous to Nagaland, the commission is of the view that it is necessary to define the status of persons belonging to any tribe other than the 18 recognised tribes of Nagaland, who are citizens of India, settled and own land in Nagaland prior to statehood (December 1963)--they may come under the category of Permanent Resident.The state government in 1974 notified around 180 families of the Gorkha community and their descendants who settled in Nagaland prior to December 31, 1940 in three districts of Kohima, Mokokchung and Wokha as Non-Naga indigenous inhabitants of Nagaland and accorded them with certain rights and privileges. While the Nagaland Gorkha Association did not insist that its members be brought under RPR with other non-Naga communities, the association requested that status quo be maintained for the families listed under the 1974 notification.While the commission asserted that it did not intend to de-recognise the special status given to the community, on examining the question of “who is indigenous”, it is of the view that it would not be justifiable to declare Gorkhas as indigenous to Nagaland. It therefore recommended that they be categorised as permanent residents, along with other non-tribal groups that settled in Nagaland before 1963. It added that the families notified by the state government in 1974 may be identified as Gorkhas and others as Nepali, but the change in nomenclature shall not deny or deprive them of benefits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nagaland-commission-on-register-of-indigenous-inhabitants-submits-recommendations-101628757634007.html

12-08-2021||Kolkata||Calcutta HC to hear Mamata Banerjee’s petition against Nandigram loss today||A single-judge bench of the Calcutta high court is scheduled to hear West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s petition challenging her defeat in the assembly election from Nandigram in Purba Medinipur.The matter is being heard by justice Shampa Sarkar after justice Kausik Chanda recused himself from hearing the petition and imposed a fine of ₹5lakh on the Trinamool Congress chief for the manner in which his recusal was sought.The matter would be heard through video conferencing at 3pm today.Even though the TMC had returned to power in the state for the third consecutive time with a sweeping victory, Banerjee lost to her protégé-turned-adversary Suvendu Adhikari by less than 2,000 votes.On July 14, the court issued a notice to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Adhikari. Banerjee was also present online for the hearing. “The bench also ordered the poll panel to preserve all records, and devices, such as EVMs, and video recordings,” said a senior advocate.The TMC chief moved the high court alleging voting irregularities in her loss by 1,956 votes to Adhikari in what was her first electoral loss in 32 years. The TMC demanded a recount shortly after the results were announced in favour of the BJP candidate, but the request was turned down by the Election Commission.The case was initially slated to be heard by justice Chanda. However, Banerjee asked for transferring the petition to another judge citing “apprehension of bias” since justice Chanda had, before his elevation to the bench in 2019, represented the BJP and its leaders in court cases.“Such calculative, psychological, and offensive attempts to seek recusal need to be firmly repulsed and a cost of ₹5lakh is imposed upon the petitioner,” justice Chanda said in his order on July 7. The money will be used to fight Covid-19, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/calcutta-hc-to-hear-mamata-banerjee-s-petition-against-her-nandigram-loss-today-101628744493445.html

Here's why it matters||Indore in Madhya Pradesh, also referred to as the "cleanest city" in India, has now also been declared the first "Water Plus" city in the country. The announcement was made by the central government on Wednesday under the Swachh Survekshan 2021. Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan lauded the city of Indore for setting an example for the whole nation in its "determination and dedication towards cleanliness.""Heartiest congratulations to the citizens of Indore as it becomes the first SBM Water certified city under Swachh Survekshan 2021," Chouhan posted on Twitter.

Indore has been an example for the whole nation for its determination and dedication towards cleanliness. May it continue bring glory to the state!What is a Water Plus city?A Water Plus city certificate is provided to a city for maintaining cleanliness in rivers and drains under its administration.According to protocol and the toolkit provided by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, a city can be declared as Water Plus only after all wastewater released from households, commercial establishments, and the like is treated to a satisfactory level before releasing the treated wastewater to the environment."As Swachh Bharat Mission has progressed significantly, it is imperative that progress attained in achieving our objectives be sustained financially and in an environmentally feasible manner," the government says. "Cities are now working towards sustainability of sanitation status, by ensuring that no untreated wastewater is discharged into the open environment."Indore, India's first Water Plus cityThere are a number of criteria that need to be met before a city is declared Water Plus, said Indore municipal commissioner Pratibha Patil. Firstly, it must be ensured that the dirty water from the city does not go into any river or drain. Secondly, all public toilets in the city must be connected to sewer lines and must be cleaned. And finally, 30 per cent of the city's sewer water has to be recycled and reused.According to Patil, people living on the banks of drains in Indore connected the outfalls of their houses in the drainage line at their personal cost. The municipal corporate commissioner said that about 7000 public and domestic sewer outfalls in the city were stopped, the city's rivers were freed from the sewer lines.The 30 per cent recycled water from the sewer was re-used by people at construction sites and by citizens for gardening purposes, the municipal official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/indore-news/indore-becomes-india-s-first-water-plus-city-here-s-why-it-matters-101628734719044.html
12-08-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka: Dissent brews in Bommai’s cabinet after allocation of portfolios||Karnataka is a living example of the adage that the more things change, the more they remain the same, and so, 16 days after BS Yediyurappa resigned as chief minister amidst widespread dissent among the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s legislators, the new chief minister Basavaraj Bommai finds himself hemmed in by dissenting legislators wanting more.On Wednesday, hours after Tourism Minister Anand Singh closed his office in Hospet in Vijayanagar , presumably indicating his intentions to resign from the cabinet, the chief minister said disgruntlement among some ministers over the portfolio allocation will be resolved smoothly.Singh previously the forests minister, has expressed his displeasure after he was made minister for tourism in the new cabinet. A former Congress lawmaker, he resigned, defected to the BJP in 2019, and sees himself as one of the architects of its climb to power in the state.“I was the first one to resign from the assembly. After eight days of my resignation, others began resigning. Because of our resignations, the BJP came to power in the State. Party leaders should have allocated a major portfolio to me,” Singh said on Saturday.The defection of the lawmakers brought down the Congress-Janata Dal (S) government that came to power after the 2018 assembly elections.On Wednesday, Singh visited a temple to offer special prayers, similar to the ones he offered before his resignation from the Congress two years ago.All of this seems to have had the desired effect on the new CM. On Wednesday, he told reporters that everything would be set right soon. “Anand Singh and I are friends for three decades. We are continuously in touch. Yesterday I spoke to him. Today also I will speak to him. I am aware of his views, and I too have conveyed my views. Everything will be set right after he comes and speaks to me.”Bommai denied that Singh has resigned .Anand Singh didn’t issue any statements to the media on Wednesday.But Singh isn’t the only one.Commenting on another disgruntled minister MTB Nagaraj, Bommai said he has spoken to him and there is no problem at all.After Bommai succeeded Yediyurappa as the Chief Minister, on August 4, he expanded his cabinet which now has 29 ministers. He retained most of the ministers in the Yediyurappa government, but dropped a few.People familiar with the matter said that apart from the two ministers who have expressed their displeasure, there are others who are unhappy with the cabinet allocations. Then there are the lawmakers unhappy at not finding a place in the cabinet. MLAs S A Ramadas, Abhay Patil, Ramesh Jarkiholi, Narasimha Naik alias Raju Gouda, M P Renukacharya, Arvind Bellad, Basanagouda Patil Yatnal and Umesh Kumathalli are among those said to be displeased at not being named ministers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-dissent-brews-in-bommai-s-cabinet-after-allocation-of-portfolios-101628728944023.html

You are only paying salaries and pensions. Look at the state the city is in today. Salaries are beginning to be such a huge figure in the scheme of things. You are a municipality. Your primary function should be municipal,” justice Singh said.“It has to be a self-sustaining mechanism. We are (entertaining) because common man should not suffer. It does not seem correct to me,” he added.Appearing for the SDMC, its counsel, sought four weeks to place on record the roadmap to augment the municipal corporation’s resources and income.Additional solicitor general KM Nataraj, who also appeared for SDMC, urged the court to direct the Delhi government to release some amount subject to orders as was released earlier in favour of the North MCD.The court, however, said, “You file account from 2012. You have to disclose securities and assets”. It questioned as to when SDMC would pay the salaries to the categories of employees in question for the month of July since salaries till only June had been paid.SDMC council Divya Prakash Pande said that while efforts were being made, since SDMC was short on funds, he could not give them a precise date.“Our heart goes out to the employees who are not being paid,” the court said.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, contended that the SDMC ought to have given the account of its income and expenditure from the time the trifurcation took place and not 2016.“The report is incomplete. These are three years and trifurcation happened in 2012,” he argued adding that SDMC was yet to comply with the July 8 order directing the civic bodies to list out steps taken to augment their resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-orders-sdmc-to-reveal-expenses-since-trifurcation-101628721576762.html

12-08-2021||Delhi||SHO shunted for ‘dereliction of duty’ a week after viral video||The station house officer (SHO) of the Adarsh Nagar police station was on Tuesday suspended for “dereliction of duty”, a week after a video showed him trying to stop a man from harassing a Muslim man over an alleged disputed religious structure.Last week, several citizens took to social media demanding the suspension of inspector CP Bhardwaj. A hashtag demanding his removal was trending on the afternoon of August 4.The video showed a man asking another person about the ownership of a mazaar on the road in Adarsh Nagar. The man was asking the second person where he lived and sought an explanation as to why the mazaar was on the road, as it was blocking traffic. Inspector Bhardwaj is seen intervening between the two.In the video, Bhardwaj, can be seen reminding the first person that for any disputed structure, the government has a committee to examine its legality. To this, the first man is seen asking Bhardwaj why a temple was demolished in Chandni Chowk. The viral video ends with the inspector taking the first man into custody.Chhattisgarh cabinet minister TS Deo tweeted, “If you are law abiding, believer in constitution, secular citizen or official, you stand against everything that BJP believes in & are liable for punishment— that’s the clear message from the BJP Govt after suspension of SHO CP Bhardwaj who responsibly averted a crisis in making.”No officer authorised to speak to the media commented on the reasons behind Bhardwaj’s suspension. However, a senior police officer, who asked not to be named, said: “The controversy over the mazaar and the viral video has nothing to do with his suspension. No one was arrested in that incident. No complaint was filed in that incident. He has been suspended because there were many complaints against him for dereliction of duty. In some cases, he did not use the correct Indian Penal Code sections and diluted the case. He also did not act on some complaints.”Bhardwaj’s personal cellphone was unavailable when HT tried to call him on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sho-shunted-for-dereliction-of-duty-a-week-after-viral-video-101628718338741.html

The four schools -- Jitender Veer Sarvhitkari Model Senior Secondary School, Sector-71, DAV Model Senior Secondary School, Kurali, and Manav Mangal Smart World, Zirakpur, and Delhi World Public School, Zirakpur, have also been ordered to close till further instructions.Deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said that after reports of Covid spread in schools emerged from Ludhiana, the Mohali administration decided to go full throttle to ensure 100% vaccination of the school staff. He said teams of the district administration, led by the sub-divisional magistrates of three sub-divisions, conducted surprise checks at the schools in the respective areas.“At Jitender Veer Sarvhitkari Model Senior Secondary School, Sector-71, where the team led by Mohali SDM Harbans Singh visited, it was found that the principal, Kavita Attri, had not taken a single dose of the Covid vaccine. The sweeper and babysitter too are unvaccinated while seven other teachers have got only a single dose so far. Records of the Smart Wonders’ School were found appropriate,” said the DC.In Kharar, where SDM Aakash Bansal led the inspection, 18 staff members of DAV Model Senior Secondary School, Kurali, had got only a single dose. It was also found that 80% of the students were in attendance for physical classes, even as only 50% strength is allowed in view of the social distancing requirements.The Dera Bassi SDM conducted checking at two schools -- Manav Mangal Smart School, Zirakpur, and Delhi World Public School, Zirakpur. He said 52 staff members of Manav Mangal Smart School and 27 of Delhi World Public School have received only a single dose of the Covid vaccine. Dayalan said police have been directed to take stern action against the erring schools as they have put the safety of children at stake. He added, “We will start a special campaign to check the schools staff’s vaccination status. I have even directed the district education officer to check government schools to ensure that all staff members are vaccinated. We will not allow any school to function unless its teachers and other staff are fully vaccinated.” On the directions of the DC, police registered a case against the management of four erring schools under Sections 188 (disobedience to order promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligently does any act which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life,), 270 (malignantly does any act which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/staff-not-fully-vaccinated-management-of-four-mohali-schools-booked-101628715571919.html
12-08-2021||Other||Guest Column: Chandigarh needs metropolitan council for governance||With complex political developments casting a shadow over the final process of reorganisation of the erstwhile state of Punjab, Chandigarh was declared a Union Territory and capital of both Punjab and Haryana, initially for five years. Years ago, a status quoist pragmatism, lent a de-facto permanence to this status. Now, this status is practically irreversible. However, the city remains deprived of an empowered democratic set-up, which is essential to truly realise former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s vision of Chandigarh as a symbol of modern, resurgent India. For the first 30 years as a Union Territory, Chandigarh only elected a member of the Lok Sabha. The municipal corporation, ever since its first elections in 1996, has only presented a modicum of local self-governance with no real say in the affairs of the UT. The member of Parliament, essentially a legislator, has no constitutional authority regarding the UT’s affairs. It is only informally that he or she can exert influence to get things done, particularly lobby with the finance minister and others, to get much-needed funds for the city. Empowered elected body only answer In essence, Chandigarh is a bureaucratically run administrative set-up. Though men of calibre, experience and attainment have run its affairs, yet civil servants cannot be a veritable substitute for democratically elected people’s representatives with necessary powers of governance and decision-making. They come for a fixed term of three years, on what are considered to be prize postings to a UT, smaller than a district in a state, but has 14 IAS and seven IPS officers; a perfect example of Parkinson’s Law at work. Few of them would have an inclination to identify themselves with the aspirations of the people to have a hands-on approach to the UT’s myriad problems. Liberty taken with the Estate Rules is an appropriate example. The elected municipal corporation completes 25 years of existence this December; the panchayats and zila parishad have ceased to exist after the merger of all villages in the municipal area, but in the absence of transfer of vital functions, funds and functionaries, as stipulated by the Constitution, it remains handicapped, rather crippled in its working, far from being a vibrant tool of democracy. There is no district planning committee in Chandigarh. An unelected UT officer has the power to direct the MC to do his bidding, including imposition of new levies. Resultantly, property tax has seen a sharp increase, water rates have been increased manifold and on the top of it is a whopping 30% sanitation cess. Yet, there is no processing of solid waste and the ever-rising dumping ground with its perennial stink has become a health hazard. Also, roads remain in a state of disrepair. All this is because the UT does not have an empowered elected body for its governance. Administrator’s advisory council a PR exercise The administrator’s advisory council, a body nominated to advise the Punjab governor in his role as the UT administrator, on matters relating to the city, has not served the purpose of being a truly people’s representative institution. The meetings, though few and far between, are more of a public relations exercise by the administration to apprise the chosen few of its work and obtain a stamp of approval. It was not always so. Prior to the practice of appointing the Punjab governor as UT administrator that started in the early ’80s, the administrator used to be a senior AGMUT-cadre IAS officer, and paradoxically, the then local advisory committee, exercised greater supervision over the functioning of the administration. Every member could send in questions for the regular meetings and the departments concerned were obliged to submit detailed replies thereto for the committee’s scrutiny. The agenda was then not prescribed by the administrator for an inane meeting. The committee had a visible say in the governance of Chandigarh. Recommendations ignored amid reservations Then, there is supposed to be the home minister’s advisory committee for Chandigarh. It last met in 2017! Twice, the parliamentary standing committee on home affairs headed, at one time or the other by Pranab Mukherjee, Sushma Swaraj and M Venkaiah Naidu, now Vice-President of India, made significant recommendations related to the governance of Chandigarh. Nothing happened. Even a directive to the adviser to the administrator and other officers to hold a monthly meeting with the local MP on development works of the city, was given a quiet burial after the first meeting, on the reservations expressed by the governor-cum-administrator about the directive’s constitutional validity. This is the status of the UT, Chandigarh. It is revenue surplus, yet it doesn’t get adequate funds from the Consolidated Fund of India to which go all its revenues. It has an MP but he is just one of the 545, unless he exerts personal influence with the Union ministers for a few more rupees for its development works. It has a glorified elected body called the municipal corporation, but in the eyes of the bureaucracy, it is only a local body and the administration is not answerable to the people. Assembly not a viable proposition for city To put in place a responsible elected institution for the governance of Chandigarh, a demand of a legislative assembly is occasionally raised in different quarters. Not undermining the spirit behind this demand, it is my considered opinion that a legislative assembly like that in Puducherry or the National Capital Territory of Delhi is not a viable proposition for Chandigarh. The next best alternative is a metropolitan council at the UT level with a chief executive councillor and executive councillors vested with executive functions and powers of different departments. Only functions such as law and order could remain with the administrator, who would continue to be the head of the administration like a governor or a lieutenant governor. Democracy is not just about holding elections every five years or so. It must establish systems of good governance through larger participation of the people in day-to-day matters concerning the people. Ward committees and resident welfare associations are those public bodies which can beneficially contribute to the development of the city as a model of urban governance. Chandigarh must allow an organic development of democratic institutions and practices from the grassroots level upwards and not summarily impose decisions from the top, howsoever well intentioned those be.

Initially, the FIR was registered under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act. Now, the administration has added Sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread the infection), 270 (malignantly does any act which he knows or has reason to believe will spread the infection), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 188 (2) (disobedience to order promulgated by public servant), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), and 340 (wrongful restraint) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice (Care & Protection of Children) Act, 2015.

DC Girish Dayalan, who had appeared before the commission through video conferencing, said, “The commission also recommended Section 304-A (causing death by negligence), but no death has taken place in the school, so it is not admissible.” When contacted, the school director Umed Singh said, “More sections have been added as one of the NGOs has a personal grudge against us. They were blackmailing us, but we did not oblige to them, so they are doing all this. Our legal team from Kota will give a reply.” The commission chairperson, in a letter to the administration, stated, “Following the examination of the Action Taken Report (ATR) and representations received from several parents, the commission is of the view that that your good office may reexamine or investigate this matter and recommend registration of FIR under 304- A, 269, 270, 34, 188 (2), 342, and 340 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice (Care & Protection of Children) Act, 2015.

On Wednesday, they met city MLA Aseem Goel along with other eight party councillors to seek his wishes.“I thank chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and party’s state chief OP Dhankar for their nomination. I hope they will take the development of the city to a higher level and provide strength to the organisational structure of the party,” the MLA wrote on his Facebook profile.There is no official order, however, from the department of urban local bodies yet, but the celebrations started in both the corners on August 10 itself. The department had on August 9 written to deputy commissioner (DC) Vikram with names of the above three mentioned leaders, asking for “character verification” by 2pm on August 10.“I have written back to the department with the required details on Tuesday. As of now, there is no official announcement by them,” the DC said. Political observers believe that the nomination of the trio will give a boost to the ruling alliance that is struggling in the MC House, in which no party is in majority. In the 20-member House, BJP and HJCP have eight councilors each, and Congress and Haryana Democratic Front have two members each. Mayor Shakti Rani Sharma is from the HJCP.“They won’t have voting rights, nor would they stand for the posts of senior deputy mayor or deputy mayor. But the House meetings are expected to become stormy, as both the parties are blaming each other for failed development works as was seen in the monsoon season and during the bhoomi pooja of the main road near Vita plant,” they said.About the candidatesSandeep Sachdeva: The inner circle man of MLA Aseem Goel, he came closer to the MLA when he had fielded his wife Shailja Sachdeva’s name before the CM as party’s mayoral candidate. Dr Vandana Sharma was given the ticket, who lost. Sachdeva is also president of Punjabi Biradari Vikas Sabha and an advocate affiliated with the MC.Suresh Sahota: He is party old-timer and former district president of Schedule Caste Morcha (Wing). His wife Sushila Sahota, a working member of the party’s women wing, was the frontrunner candidate from ward 14, which later went to ally JJP’s quota. The party had, however, lost all four seats it contested.Vivek Chaudhary: Young face of the party, he is JJP state spokesperson and enjoys proximity to deputy CM Dushyant Chautala. Earlier affiliated to the INLD, he switched to JJP during its inception in January 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-from-bjp-one-from-jjp-tipped-to-be-nominated-councillors-in-ambala-mc-101628713893398.html

Mid-fielder Monika Malik arrived in Chandigarh on Tuesday to a hero’s welcome.In high spirits, Malik, a product of Chandigarh Hockey Academy (CHA), said hockey was the clear winner for India. “We could not win a medal, but the reception and the messages we have received have made us so proud.

We will be a stronger squad for Paris Olympics in 2024,” said Malik, who after spending three years at the CHA in her formative years, moved to Haryana. The India women’s team beat Australia 1-0 in the quarter-finals to enter the semi-finals. However, they lost 3-4 in a pulsating bronze-medal playoff against Great Britain.

The management of BCM Arya Model Senior Secondary School in Shastri Nagar has decided to discontinue the physical classes, which had resumed only two days ago, for primary sections (UKG to Class 5). However, teaching in online mode will continue. Other schools have also been forced to reconsider the decision to continue in-person teaching. School managements stated that even as offline classes were being offered, timetable was fixed in such a manner that students visited the campus in staggered manner, that too after getting consent from their parents. Necessary precautions such as social distancing and wearing of masks were also being followed strictly, school authorities said. Kritika Seth, HR head of BCM Arya school, said, “We were taking all precautions to keep the students and teachers safe, but the decision to discontinue offline classes for primary sections has been made as a precautionary step considering the risk. The decision regarding the rest of the classes will be taken after assessing the situation. Both offline and online learning for classes 6 to 12 will continue, while just online classes will be offered to the primary section students for now.” The management of Sacred Heart Convent School in Sarabha Nagar said that they had not yet opened the school for regular classes and decided to continue with online classes only. Vice-principal of Guru Nanak Public School in Sarabha Nagar, GS Nagi, said their offline classes had resumed only for senior sections (classes 10 to 12). “We had been contemplating to start the offline classes for primary sections and have now sought suggestion from the parents, considering the situation,” said Nagi, while adding that they were also waiting for the government’s reaction after cases being reported from state-run schools. Many schools felt that immediate shutdown of educational institutions might further inculcate fear among the students, parents and the faculty, even as the teachers and school staff have been vaccinated. Schools have not made it mandatory for the students to attend offline classes. JK Sidhu, principal of DAV school in BRS Nagar, said they had reopened for offline classes on Monday (August 9) only. “For primary sections (nursery to Class 6), regular classes have been scheduled to be held from Thursday to Saturday and for others, it will be from Monday to Wednesday. The primary sections are scheduled to attend the first offline class since March on Thursday and preparations have been made. Offline classes will continue in a staggered manner this week and decision regarding the next week will be taken as per the prevailing situation,” said Sidhu. Various schools have also decided to continue with both offline and online classes amid strict compliance with Covid-appropriate behaviour. Many schools also mentioned that low attendance was being witnessed. As per most of the school managements, only 10-15% attendance was being recorded for offline classes and it was assumed that it would further reduce following the latest resurgence of Covid cases. Principal of KVM school, Navita Puri, said in-person learning for students of classes 1 to 12 commenced on August 3 and they were continuing with both online and offline classes. “We opened the school for classes 1 to 9 on August 9, while the classes for senior sections were being held since July. Low footfall is being witnessed at the school. We are taking all required precautions and no decision has yet been made to stop offline classes,” said Neelam Mittal, principal of BVM school in Kitchlu Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/infection-among-students-major-setback-for-ludhiana-schools-101628711195022.html

The DC said the administration had been running the vaccination drive aggressively and has inoculated 16.12 lakh residents so far.Ensure aggressive sampling, early detection of cases: DCDC Sharma on Wednesday also took stock of the sampling drive in the government senior secondary school on Cemetery Road and directed the health department to augment the drive and ensure collection of 1,500 samples daily.He told the officials to instantly upload the latest data on Cova App, which would further help the rapid response teams in collecting samples.The DC said that the only way to flatten the curve and break the transmission chain was to do more and more testing, treating and isolating the patients at the earliest.Accompanied by additional deputy commissioner (ADC) (UD) Sandeep Kumar, ADC (G) Rahul Chaba, SDM Vaneet Kumar, the DC asked the health department to further increase the number of sampling teams from 250 to 300 to ensure aggressive sampling, early detecting, containing and treating the potential Covid cases.48 RRT, 275 sampling teams formedDistrict epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Bhagat said as many as 48 rapid response teams and nearly 275 sampling teams have been formed to meet any exigency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhianas-daily-caseload-doubles-in-24-hours-101628711193941.html
12-08-2021||Chandigarh||Covid norms go for a toss after school hours in Ludhiana||Clear violation of Covid norms by students after school hours is turning out to be the latest trigger in fresh infection spike in Ludhiana. Scenes of students not following Covid-appropriate behaviour were witnessed outside Government Senior Secondary Model School in PAU as well as another government school near Saggu Chowk. The situation was no different outside private schools across the city. There was no check by school authorities on students, who were leaving the premises in Sarabha Nagar and Civil Lines. A government schoolteacher, who wished to remain anonymous, said while Covid protocols were strictly maintained on the campus, students tend to let their guards down once the school hours get over. Prof PS Bhogal, who teaches political science at Arya College, Civil Lines, said the students were not to be blamed. “Students are young, innocent and full of energy. Many of them are meeting their peer group after nearly a year. It is important that the authorities devise some mechanism to stop the intermingling of students during and after school hours,” said Bhogal. No sampling in private schools yet, DEOs asked to share listWhile testing has been intensified in government schools after 20 students tested positive for coronavirus, no tests are being carried out in private schools to check the status of infection. The matter was again highlighted during the visit of DC Varinder Kumar Sharma to the government school on Cemetery Road. Some of the parents demanded that sampling on similar lines should be carried out in private schools as well. “The health department is aware of the prominent private schools of the town, but no testing has been carried out in private schools,” said Davinder Sharma, one of the parents.Meanwhile, district epidemiologist Dr Rameh Bhagat said, “We have asked the district education officers (DEOs), both elementary and secondary, to share the list of private schools in the district so that the health department could start collecting samples.However, despite repeated attempts, comments of DEO (secondary) Lakhvir Singh couldn’t be elicited. Schools, colleges driver of infection: CMCH reportChristian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) in its report presented to the government earlier during the year had mentioned that schools and colleges could be drivers of the virus.In the report, it was observed that youngsters carry high viral load, but mild symptoms of infection which could result in the virus spread among the elderly.Even during the second wave, it had come to the fore that 18 teachers and 28 students were found infected at the government school in Galib Kalan. One of the teachers had even succumbed to the contagion. Soon, cases began to emerge from other government schools and within a span of a month, second wave of the pandemic had spread in the entire district.No need to panic: DC“There is no need to panic as necessary action is being taken. We have identified that the 20 infected students live in 12 colonies located in the vicinity of the school. All the students are asymptotic. Health department teams have been sent to these colonies to test the family members and people with whom the children had come in contact. Only those teachers who have been fully vaccinated are allowed to attend the schools,” the DC said. “We do not want to take any knee-jerk action. Already, children’s studies have taken a hit due to the closing of schools. I have asked the health department to conduct RTPCR tests instead of rapid-antigen ones,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-norms-go-for-a-toss-after-school-hours-in-ludhiana-101628711192785.html

In a press statement, Mann said ₹137.56 crore of outstanding amount up to 2016 was being collected 4.37 lakh Dalit consumers who are getting 200 units of free electricity. “The Congress government is running away from paying these arrears. It should immediately reverse this anti-Dalit and anti-poor move. Also, the previous SAD-BJP government had started the 200-unit free power scheme to garner votes from the Dalits and underprivileged sections but made no provision to keep the scheme going in the long run,” he added. He also sought clarification from SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal on this issue as he was now making false promises of giving free power up to 400 units. The AAP leader alleged that earlier the Badal family looted the state in the name of providing free electricity to the Dalits and the poor and now the Amarinder-led government was cheating them in the name of this scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-bjp-sad-always-used-dalits-poor-as-vote-bank-maan-101628711138684.html

I had sought a proposal in this regard and it will be sent to the Niti Aayog. The work will start once we get the nod.”Government Primary School, Dutt Road, has been running from the roof of a gurdwara for decades while Government Primary School, Patti Roopa, runs from a community hall of a public park in the absence of their own building.A teacher of at the Dutt Road school said, “The district education department has selected two municipal sites for shifting of the school and it will be finalised by the administration.”“The primary and high schools at Dashmesh Nagar are running from a congested place measuring 550 square yards. These schools have around 550 students. But they do not have playground, vehicle parking area or space for holding morning assembly. The other schools are also functioning from congested spaces but they have their own land,” said an official.

Since February 2012, the DCI has repeatedly asked all the dental colleges in the country to get the mandatory NAAC accreditation, as per clause 9 of the Dental Council of India (Miscellaneous) Regulations, 2007. But 15 dental colleges of Punjab, including the two run by government at Amritsar and Patiala, besides 272 across the country have been continuously ignoring the DCI’s directions as they did not get accredited from NAAC or submitted the certificate. Of a total 315 dental colleges in the country, only 28 have submitted the certificate so far. DCI assistant secretary Dr Vinay Gupta said the body’s executive committee in a recent meeting took up the matter of non-furnishing the valid NAAC accreditation certificate by the dental colleges. “But even after issuing repeated reminders, only a few colleges got accredited by NAAC and furnished the necessary certificate to the DCI. All the dental colleges that have not yet got themselves accredited are strictly advised to get done the same within six months or action will be initiated against them as per rules. A circular to this effect will be issued to the dental college concerned,” the notice read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/all-15-punjab-dental-colleges-warned-of-action-if-naac-certificate-not-furnished-101628711131610.html

He claimed that earlier too he had urged the PM to call a meeting with an all-party delegation from Punjab.He further underlined the need to compensate the farmers for the management of paddy straw at ₹100 per quintal and allay the fears of fertiliser shortage which could aggravate their problems. The CM stressed that due to fragmentation of landholdings and persistent disputes with lessees, market operators and agents, the farmers are also facing more litigation these days.“It is, thus, the need of the hour to amend section 12 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, to include farmers and farm workers in the category of those entitled to free legal services to pursue and defend themselves in courts to secure their livelihood,” he said.The CM urged Modi to advise the Union ministries dealing with farmer welfare and laws to carry out necessary amendments to the Legal Services Authorities Act in the larger interest of the farming community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amarinder-meets-pm-modi-presses-for-repeal-of-three-farm-laws-101628711072143.html

12-08-2021||Chandigarh||5 food supply officials booked for siphoning off 24K quintals wheat||Charges of criminal breach of trust by a public servant, and criminal conspiracy figure in the FIR registered against five food and civil supply department officials, including four inspectors, for allegedly siphoning off 24,000 quintals of wheat meant for Atta Dal scheme beneficiaries in Sultanpur Lodhi. Hindustan Times had on June 25 reported the pilferage of 24,000 quintal grain. The accused have been identified as Vivek Sharma, Bhupinder Singh, Vikas Sethi, Rameshwar Singh, all food supply inspectors, and Munish Bassi, assistant food supply inspector. The accused were posted at Sultanpur Lodhi between October 2020 and May 2021 and were suspended for not distributing the grain to the beneficiaries. On July 26, Kapurthala district food supply controller Geeta Bishambhu had written to senior superintendent of police (SSP) Harkamalpreet Singh Khakh for legal action against two of the five accused, Vivek Gupta and Bhupinder Singh. Sultanpur Lodhi deputy superintendent of police Sarwan Singh Bal said the accused were booked on the basis of a departmental inquiry report and investigations will bring to the fore their exact role and modus operandi. No arrest has been made so far. Food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu had suspended the four food inspectors for not disbursing wheat to the eligible beneficiaries. In June this year, Bishambhu conducted a probe after Sultanpur Lodhi MLA Navtej Singh Cheema and members of the Kisan Union lodged multiple complaints over non-disbursement of wheat between October 2020 and March 2021. It was found that the department’s Sultanpur Lodhi centre didn’t provide records of wheat distribution to the inspection teams despite repeated orders, holding them guilty of “grave negligence”. The accused were booked under section 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant), 120B (criminal conspiracy) of Indian Penal Code and 13(2) (criminal misconduct by public servant) of Prevention of Corruption Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/5-food-supply-officials-booked-for-siphoning-off-24k-quintals-wheat-101628710837374.html

The confiscation order pertains to a multi-crore synthetic narcotics racket, commonly known as the Bhola drug case, unearthed in 2013-14 in Punjab. The properties include immovable assets, Indian and foreign currencies and fixed deposits that were in the name jailed prime accused Jagdish Singh Bhola, and four other accused — Roy Bahadur Nirwal, Mahesh Gaba, Anoop Singh Kahlon and Varinder Singh Raja — who are absconding. The agency said in a statement that the court “while passing the confiscation order categorically observed that no objection regarding confiscation of the properties has come from any quarter in spite of publication in the newspaper to the public”. “The court held that since the properties attached by the ED have been confirmed by the adjudicating authority (of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act) and the accused persons have been declared as proclaimed offenders (by the court) for evading the process of law subsequent to prosecution complaints filed against them, the said properties are confiscated to the central government,” it said. The money laundering case was filed by the ED after the FIRs registered by the Punjab Police. Bhola was arrested by the ED in January 2014. “He has filed three bail applications on various dates, however, all were dismissed by the special court,” the ED said. The ED till now has attached assets to the tune of ₹95 crore in this case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-court-orders-confiscation-of-10-cr-assets-in-bhola-drug-case-101628710591584.html

12-08-2021||Chandigarh||Climate change, fragile ecology make Kinnaur a ticking time bomb: Experts||With another landslide claiming multiple lives at Negulsari in Kinnaur district, the fragility of the ecology of the Himalayan region, which is at increasing risk due to climate change, has come to the forefront. Kinnaur, which is one of the remotest parts of Himachal, sits on a ticking time bomb as climate change compounded with a fragile ecology has increased the incidence of landslides in the region. Experts say that the tribal district is bearing the brunt of large devastation brought by hydropower projects built in the Sutlej River valley, which has disturbed its ecology. A study conducted in Kinnaur between 2012 and 2016 found that hydropower proliferation in the name of ‘clean energy’ has brought rapid land-use changes adversely impacting local terrestrial ecosystems and the communities inhabiting them.Increase in hydroelectric projects a factorIt found that 90% of the area of ‘forest land’ diverted to non-forest activities between 1980 and 2014 was transferred for hydro-electric projects (HEP) and transmission lines (TL), leading to change in land-use, fragmentation of forests and loss of biodiversity in the Kinnaur region, while the ‘compensatory afforestation’, carried out as a ‘mitigation’ measure for loss of forests and a mandatory condition for forest clearance for the forest diversion has not able to fulfil its stated objective. Manshi Asher of Himdhara Collective, an environment group based in Himachal, said a fragile ecology, climate change and unplanned development make Kinnaur vulnerable to climate disasters. “Kinnaur, which is located in the greater Himalayas, is inheritably fragile. Due to a lot of tectonic movement the region is highly sensitive seismically and geologically,” said Asher, adding that climate change has further aggravated the problem. “Global warming has resulted in change in rainfall pattern and areas, such as Kinnaur, that used to get less rainfall have been witnessing high rainfall, increasing incidence of landslide, while the third and most vital issue is haphazard construction taking place in the mountains,” she said. Asher said, “Tunneling, excavation and blasting is being carried out for large hydropower projects that have been executed or planned in Kinnaur district, which makes the fragile landscapes feebler. Transmission lines are also coming up, for which the land use has been changed and trees have been cut.” She said Negulsari, the site of the latest disaster, is also in close proximity of one of the largest hydropower projects -Nathpa Jhakri. Professor Ambrish Kumar Mahajan of the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Central University of Himachal Pradesh, also agrees. “Himachal falls in a high-risk seismic zone and Kinnaur is fragile due to its highly-jointed and fractured geology,” he said, adding that a lot of developmental activities are taking place on steep slopes, which “clubbed together, have made Kinnaur a hub of landslide disasters.” Mahajan says that not just Kinnaur but Himachal as a whole is prone to such disasters, which have been evidenced recently. Disturbingly, Himachal has witnessed a two-fold increase in landslide incidents this year. The state saw over 35 major landslide incidents in July alone as compared to 16 landslides during monsoon last year. Earlier this year, 10 people had died after a landslide swept away half-a-dozen houses in Rulehar village of Shahpur subdivision in Kangra district and on July 25, a mini bus ferrying tourists was hit by a massive landslide at Batseri in Kinnaur, leaving nine people dead and two injured. Scientists’ warnings ignored Though scientists have issued multiple warnings, the state government has not done much to mitigate such disasters. The environment department of the Himachal Pradesh government, in its State Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan, had warned that there may be floods, landslides, glacial lake bursts, excess rainfall, excess snowfall and unseasonal rains in 2012. It had said that the state could experience a difference of 1-5 °C in minimum temperature and 0.5-2.5 °C in maximum temperature by 2030.It claimed that monsoon in Himachal would increase by 5-10 days by 2030. As per the document, high-altitude areas of Kinnaur, Lahaul-Spiti, Chamba and Kullu, which usually receive heavy snowfall are now witnessing more rain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/climate-change-fragile-ecology-make-kinnaur-a-ticking-time-bomb-experts-101628710412850.html
12-08-2021||Chandigarh||Kandowalia murder: One of 4 assailants arrested in Amritsar||One of the four assailants who gunned down gangster Ranbir Singh, alias Rana Kandowalia, in a private hospital in Amritsar last week was arrested on Wednesday, said police. Gurminderjit Singh, alias Happy Shah, of Chahal Kalan village in Batala was arrested by the Amritsar commissionerate police following a tip-off. Police have also recovered a pistol and five cartridges from his possession. During interrogation, Happy Shah told the police that they planned to eliminate Kandowalia around a month ago at the instance of gangster Jagdeep Singh, alias Jaggu Bhagwanpuria, who is lodged in Delhi’s Tihar jail. Kandowalia, who was facing nearly a dozen criminal cases, including those of murder and attempt to murder, was shot dead by four armed men when he was enquiring about his cousin sister’s health in a private hospital situated on the Circular Road on August 4. Soon after the incident, a Facebook post from an account named after Jaggu Bhagwanpuria was also surfaced claiming the responsibility of killing Kandowalia. Police had booked Bhagwanpuria and four assailants, identified as Money Rayya, Mandeep Singh, alias Toofan, Happy Shah, and a Haryana-based man, for murder. Later, six more persons were nominated in the case for sheltering the accused. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP-investigation) Mukhwinder Singh Bhullar said: “According to Happy’s confessional statement, Bhagwanpuria had instructed him and three other assailants to eliminate Kandowalia. Earlier, they had planned to kill Kandowalia near a gym in Ranjit Avenue in Amritsar on July 31, but due heavy police presence, they could not execute the plan.”Giving the possible reasons for Kandowalia’s killing, Bhullar said: “A few months ago, Kandowalia and his associates shared a picture of cake for Bhagwanpuria on Facebook and ridiculed him. The two groups entered into a war of words on the social networking site. Things worsened when name of slain gangster Patti Lama, who was gunned down in a gang war in Patti a few years ago, cropped up. Patti Lama was Bhagwanpuria’s aide and he suspected that Kandowalia was behind his killing.”The DCP said their process to bring Bhagwanpuria on a production warrant from Tihar jail was on. Police have also arrested one more person, Gurpreet Singh, alias Gopi, of Gagarbhana village in Amritsar for allegedly providing shelter to the four assailants. A pistol and seven live rounds have also been recovered from Gopi. Earlier, police had arrested one Nanit Sharma of Batala for harbouring the assailants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kandowalia-murder-one-of-4-assailants-arrested-in-amritsar-101628710351528.html

However, the mall management will have to ensure that all their employees are fully vaccinated and the same rule is followed while allowing customers to step inside their premises. The onus of checking the certificate for full vaccination will be on the management. The hotels and restaurants, which, too, can operate till 10pm, from the current timing of 4pm, will have to ensure that their employees are fully vaccinated and they are masked at all times. Restaurants, gymnasiums and spas are allowed to operate at 50% of their capacity.The number of people allowed to attend wedding ceremonies has been increased to 200 if it’s taking place at open place like lawns, while the number of attendees is restricted to 100 or 50% of the sitting capacity if the venue is enclosed one. Indoor games have been allowed till 10pm provided that everyone including players on the premises are fully vaccinated.Private offices, too, have been allowed to operate at their full capacity and for 24X7, provided the office timings are staggered and the employees are fully vaccinated. “The offices can operate at 25% of their capacity per shift and the employees are fully vaccinated. The private offices are for the first time allowed to operate day and night, but they should follow the Covid-19 protocol,” Tope said.The health minister said that the relaxations come with a rider in the wake of the potential third wave of the virus. The state cabinet has put the threshold of requirement of the oxygen to treat Covid-19 patients. “If the daily requirement of the Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) reaches 700 MT, strict lockdown will be imposed immediately. Maharashtra’s LMO generation per day is 1,300MT, which is expected to go up to 2,000 MT in next few days because of the augmentation measures taken by us. As per the Central government’s direction the state government should augment the oxygen capacity to 1.5 times the requirement at the peak of the second wave. As per that parameter, the requirement would be 3,800MT, against our generation of 2,000MT. Since the possibility of supply of the LMO from other states is less if the third wave strikes, we have decided to strictly impose the lockdown again if the requirement goes up,” Tope said.The state government had started imposing strict lockdown from April 5 after the second wave of Covid-19 struck the state. The unlocking of the curbs started from first week of June by allowing non-essential shops and establishments to operate for limited period. The state, earlier this month, extended the period of operation of shops and establishment, excluding 11 districts with high covid-19 cases. On Sunday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced opening up of the local trains for fully vaccinated citizens from August 15. State has now announced to roll out few more relaxations for across the state.“The relaxations will be applicable across the state, including the 11 districts which have high number of cases. There will restrictions imposed by the district administrations restricted to the tehsils that are worst affected of Covid. A few tehsils in Satara and Solapur are going through such restrictions and curfews. The containment at the local level will be effectively implemented in these districts,” the minister said.The number of the active cases in state has dropped to 68,375, of which 31, 263 have been admitted to hospitals. 11,147 of them are critical, and 4,248 of them are in the ICU. 1,673 patients are on ventilator support.The 11 districts, which had been continuously reporting high growth rate, test positivity rate for last few months have shown improvement. Against state’s growth rate of 0.10%, 11 districts have reported more growth ranging between 0.11 and 0.39%. State’s weekly positivity rate stands at 3.05%, against which seven districts have reported high positivity rate ranging between 3.40 and 6.64%.Meanwhile, Maharashtra reported 5,560 new Covid-19 cases and 163 fresh deaths on Wednesday, taking the tally to 6,369,002 cases and toll to 13,464. Mumbai logged 285 new cases and reported nine deaths, while Pune district logged 1,146 new cases.“We have apprehension of the rise in the cases post festive season and also because of the relaxations rolled out like witnessed after the first wave last year. This time it hopefully would not be that severe because of the vaccination coverage. The people should follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, while the local authorities should ensure that tracking of the close contacts of infected people and testing was done properly,” said Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the state-appointed Covid-19 deaths audit committee.Meanwhile, people travelling to Maharashtra from other states, will require RT-PCR done 72 hours before their arrival or mandatory isolation for 14 days if they are not fully vaccinated.Political, social, religious, cultural programmes, election rallies, protests, birthday celebrations at public places remain to be prohibited. Takeaway services at hotels and restaurants can now operate 24 hours. Last order of the dinner in hotels should be placed at 9pm so that the hotel is closed by 10pm.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has, however, said that citizens should not lower their guard in the wake of the drop in Covid-19 cases. “We have to take due care in the wake of the newer variations of the virus posing challenges before all of us. The state government does not like to impose curbs, but the Delta variant is posing a serious threat in countries like US, UK again. We will have to take utmost care at public places,” he said. Thackeray further added, “The second wave had posed a challenge to oxygen supply not only in Maharashtra, but in other states as well. We have set the threshold of demand of oxygen to treat patients for the lockdown curbs. The lockdown will be reimposed soon after the demand reaches 700MT, required for 30,000 patients (currently, 2,575 patients are on oxygen supply and 1,673 on ventilators).”Govt rethink on resuming classesMumbai A day after it issued a government resolution (GR) allowing schools and junior colleges to reopen from August 17, the state is likely to defer its decision amid the fear of infection among students, which is an unvaccinated class. After strong opposition from the state-appointed Covid-19 task force and the paediatric task- force to reopen schools and junior colleges, the state cabinet has decided to revisit the decision.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting with officials from the health department, school education department and members of both the task forces to discus the opening of schools and junior colleges.“Both the task forces, unanimously, opposed the move in the backdrop of the rise in the cases elsewhere in the country where the schools were opened. Secondly, the students are not vaccinated, leaving the high risk of them getting infected. This has necessitated to revisit the decision of reopening of schools and colleges,” said health minister Rajesh Tope. The school education department, through the GR issued on Tuesday, has allowed to reopen the schools for classes 5 to 7 in rural areas and classes 8 to 12 in urban areas from August 17.Tope said that the decision over the opening of the senior colleges will be taken after the reports from district level education societies and the universities are submitted to the government in next few days. When asked if the likely deferment of the decision of reopening of the schools is the result of lack of coordination within government, Tope said, “Different departments have right to have different opinions. The school education department, however, does not appear to have taken the opinion of the task forces into account while issuing the GR.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-shops-eateries-can-be-open-till-10pm-from-aug-15-101628709815907.html
12-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 20 more cases of Covid Delta plus variant; total cases reaches 65||The Maharashtra health department on Wednesday said they have found another 20 cases of Covid-19’s Delta Plus variant in the state. It was confirmed in the genome-sequencing report conducted by NIV (Pune), National Centre for Cell Science, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB). The total number of Delta Plus cases in Maharashtra has reached 65.Of the 20 cases, the maximum (seven) are in Mumbai and three in Pune. Besides, two cases each were found in Palghar, Raigad, Nanded and Gondia and one case each was found in Chandrapur and Akola. The first 21 Delta Plus cases were found in the state in June.Genome sequencing is an exercise to study changes in the structure of the virus over time. A combination of changes in the ribonucleic acid of the virus can give birth to a new variant. It helps in ascertaining the types of variants infecting the citizens in the state. It is being done on the samples taken from the Covid-positive patients.To speed up the genome-sequencing process, the state government in April signed an MoU with CSIR-IGIB to sequence 100 Covid-positive samples each from 36 districts every month. Besides, 10 sentinel centres that include five laboratories and five hospitals, send samples to National Institute of Virology (NIV) and National Centre for Cell Science (NCCC) for sequencing in every 15 days. Each of them sent 15 samples for sequencing, the officials said.“Since April, the state has sent around 8,000 samples for genome sequencing and 80% of them are found to be Delta (B.1.617.2) variants, said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer.“We are investigating each and every case of Delta Plus. We are trying to get epidemiological information of all the cases to ascertain its transmission and virulence, its response to the vaccine etc., which will help to contain the outbreak and transmission, if any,” Dr Awate said.Barring one death, all the other 65 patients found to be symptomatic or having mild symptoms, he added.The state government has started contact tracing of high-risk and low-risk contacts of index cases in the affected districts. Their genome sequencing will also be done if found Covid positive. It has further started surveillance for Influenza Like Illness (ILI), Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI). This is being done to ascertain the differentiating factor between Delta and Delta Plus variants and understand their virulence and transmissibility, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-20-more-cases-of-covid-delta-plus-variant-total-cases-reaches-65-101628709813208.html
12-08-2021||Lucknow||Proposal mooted to give automobile dealers in Uttar Pradesh right to register new vehicles||Automobile dealers in Uttar Pradesh may get all the legal rights to register new vehicles in their showrooms if the state government accepts a proposal to this effect, people closely dealing with the issue have revealed.The regional transport offices (RTOs) would delegate their registering authority to the dealers once the state government acts upon the transport department’s latest proposal in this regard, they said. The proposal sent by transport commissioner Dheeraj Sahu to the state government last week has sought an amendment to the State Motor Vehicle Rules to designate automobile dealers as “special registering authority” in the state to register new vehicles (with fully built body) that they sell to their customers. Sahu, in the proposal, has also said that the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 empowers a state government to delegate its registering authority to any other individual/agency and some states, including Rajasthan and Delhi, have already delegated this authority to dealers.“The department has sent a proposal to the government proposing designation of automobile dealers as special registering authority to register new vehicle, generate registration number for them, issue the high security registration plate and deposit tax, all under one roof, with people having no need to apply for the same to the RTO,” said a senior transport official requesting anonymity. The move, he claimed, would cut delays and eliminate much of the alleged irregularities in RTOs.Under the current system, dealers act merely as an agent between the customer and the RTO with the latter generating and allotting the registration number to a vehicle after the owner applies for the same and pays the tax. While the tax is paid online from the showroom itself on the purchase of a vehicle, one has to wait for a few days to get the registration number from the regional transport office. “Once the dealers are appointed special registering authority, people will be able to get the registration number for their vehicle instantly after they purchase it from any showroom,” the official said. A senior official in the government, however, said that the transport commissioner’s proposal needed to be vetted legally before the same was accepted and acted upon.The amended Motor Vehicles Act, according to him, did not permit the government to delegate any of its functions, including registering authority, to any private individual or agency.“Under Section 215 (B) of the MV (Amendment Act), both the Centre or the state government can delegate any power or functions that has been conferred upon it by the Act to any public servant or public authority to discharge any of its powers, functions and duties under the Act,” he pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/proposal-mooted-to-give-automobile-dealers-in-uttar-pradesh-right-to-register-new-vehicles-101628709811607.html
12-08-2021||Chandigarh||Rawat to come to Chandigarh to mediate Between Capt and Sidhu||All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat will come to Chandigarh next week to mediate between chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and state Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu for unity in the party. The state affairs in-charge was asked by Congress president Sonia Gandhi to ensure unity in the Punjab unit after Amarinder took up with her the criticism of his government by newly appointed state chief, said sources. The chief minister, who met Sonia for the first time on Tuesday since Sidhu’s elevation, is learnt to have told her that continued and repeated targeting of the state government would be detrimental to the party in the run-up to the assembly polls early next year. Sources said the CM also showed Sidhu’s tweets and statements and urged the Congress president to rein him in for smooth functioning. After the meeting, Rawat had said that she advised the state government and the party organisation to work together. “The Congress president also asked me to ensure that both (Amarinder and Sidhu) work within their respective limits, but cooperate with each other,” he told reporters. Before his appointment, Sidhu had publicly targeted Amarinder and the state government for allegedly “colluding” with Badals and non-fulfilment of key poll promises. Though he is not taking direct digs at the chief minister by name now, his attacks on the state government have not stopped. The Congress central leadership, which had held a series of meetings with 150-odd state leaders before naming the new state unit team, had expected the truce to work, especially after it managed to ensure the chief minister’s presence at Sidhu’s installation ceremony to put up a united face. However, it has proved to be fragile as Sidhu and other detractors are questioning the government on the 18-point agenda set by the high command for implementation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rawat-to-come-to-chandigarh-to-mediate-between-capt-and-sidhu-101628709511528.html
12-08-2021||Chandigarh||Sidhu appoints 4 advisers, picks MP, ex-IPS officer||Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Wednesday appointed four advisers, including Lok Sabha member Dr Amar Singh and former IPS officer Mohammad Mustafa, to seek their “wise counsel” on party affairs in the state. The four advisers, who also include Dr Pyare Lal Garg and Malwinder Singh Mali, have been appointed with immediate effect. “I personally hold each of them in high regard, for their vision and work to envisage a better future for every Punjabi,” he wrote in the appointment order. Sidhu was appointed the Punjab Congress president by the party leadership last month despite strong opposition from chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh. The party also appointed four working presidents with him. Amar Singh, a retired 1981-batch IAS officer of Madhya Pradesh cadre, is currently MP from Fatehgarh Sahib. He had worked with Sidhu as his adviser when the latter was the local government minister in the present government. The former bureaucrat quit the position in February 2018 and then got elected as MP in 2019. “I am a party worker. I will perform whatever role the party gives to ensure that it comes in power in 2022,” the MP said, thanking the Sidhu. Most other Congress Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha members from Punjab are backing chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh.Mustafa’s wife Razia Sultana is a cabinet minister and has sided with Sidhu. A retired IPS officer of the 1985-batch, Mustafa was among those superseded by 1987-batch officer Dinkar Gupta when he was appointed the state police chief by the Amarinder Singh government in February 2019. He challenged the appointment in the court. Garg is a social activist and former registrar of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences.Mali retired from government service where he worked with the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) as a script writer and now regularly comments on political affairs on social media and television channels. He has been severely criticising Amarinder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-appoints-4-advisers-picks-up-mp-ex-ips-officer-101628708671507.html
12-08-2021||Chandigarh||Corruption case: HC reserves judgment on Saini’s plea seeking bail||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday reserved its judgment on a plea of former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini seeking anticipatory bail in a corruption case. The former Punjab DGP’s plea was taken up by the bench of justice Avneesh Jhingan on Wednesday and after arguments from the state as well as his lawyers, was reserved for the verdict to be pronounced on Thursday. His bail plea was dismissed by a Mohali trial court on August 6. On August 2, the Punjab vigilance bureau had registered a case under the Prevention of Corruption Act and criminal conspiracy against the former DGP along with six others, including PWD executive engineer Nimratdeep Singh and his father Surinderjit Singh Jaspal, who owned the Sector 20 house in Chandigarh. The agency alleged Saini acquired the house in a fraudulent deal with fake documents and questionable financial transactions. The trial court had termed allegations against him “gravest” in nature warranting his custodial interrogation. Saini all along has denied the allegation and claimed that he was being targeted as he was instrumental in some probes against the incumbent chief minister, Capt Amarinder Singh, and some persons close to him during the previous SAD-BJP regime. He has also argued that he bought the property for ₹10.25 crore and was not aware of the manner house was acquired by the owner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/corruption-case-hc-reserves-judgment-on-saini-s-plea-seeking-bail-101628708132262.html

12-08-2021||Chandigarh||Union health minister orders 25% increase in Punjab vaccine supplies||On the request of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh for more vaccine supplies in view of the forthcoming festival season and 26 lakh people overdue for second Covishield shot, Union health and family welfare minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Wednesday ordered immediate increase in Punjab’s allocation by 25%. The CM had sought supply of 55 lakh doses of Covid vaccine on priority for the state. Mandaviya assured the CM of all help and said supplies would ease from next month and he will fulfil the state’s requirement by October 31. He ordered the department to immediately increase Punjab’s allocation to meet its urgent requirement. The CM said with sufficient supplies, the state government could arrange to vaccinate 5-7 lakh people daily. He pointed out that allocation of vaccine for Punjab for August stood at only 20,47,060 doses of Covishield, while around 26 lakh doses of this were required just for those whose second dose was overdue. Citing the data, the CM said Punjab has relatively less allocation of vaccines (and hence very low per capita vaccination) as compared to the other states, and it needs to be increases to cover more population and catch up with the others. As of August 7, Haryana’s per capita vaccination stands at 35.2, Delhi’s 39.4, J&K’s 43.7, Himachal’s 62 and Rajasthan’s 35.1, as against 27.1 in Punjab. The CM said that Punjab has till August 7 received only 1,00,73,821 doses, as against Haryana (1,27,94,804), Delhi (1,06,79,728), J&K (66,90,063), Himachal Pradesh (55,51,177) and Rajasthan (34,954,868). Amarinder also sought access for the state to the CoWIN portal for analytical purposes. CM pushes for bulk drug park Amarinder also urged Mandaviya to consider Punjab’s request for setting up a bulk drug park at Bathinda in response to the department of pharmaceuticals, ministry of chemical and fertilizers. The state government had applied in October 2020 to set up the park over 1,320 acres in Bathinda, with the council of ministers approving attractive incentives for the same, he said, adding that all conditions of the Union ministry had been met. During the meeting with the Union minister, who holds additional portfolio of chemicals and fertilizers, the CM also reiterated Punjab government’s demand for enhanced allocation of DAP stocks to Punjab, as per the revised demand by the state. Suppliers should be directed to ensure that adequate supplies are given as per schedule, he told the minister, reiterating the points he had raised on Tuesday in this regard during his meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/union-health-minister-orders-25-increase-in-punjab-vaccine-supplies-101628708011837.html
12-08-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab govt orders 10,000 Covid tests in schools daily||The Punjab government on Wednesday ordered to conduct at least 10,000 RT-PCR tests in state schools daily, after 26 students tested positive for coronavirus in the past two days.Chairing a coronavirus review meeting, chief secretary Vini Mahajan directed the departments concerned to conduct at least 10,000 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests and the DCs to ensure that only fully vaccinated teaching and non-teaching staff was allowed to attend the schools. She directed that a target of 40,000 samples per day must be achieved and testing shall be further increased if the Covid cases rise. The CS also expressed concern over the movement of people to Punjab from neighbouring states, where the virus cases were once again on the rise, and asked the officials concerned to keep a close watch on the positivity rate ahead of the festival season when extra vigil was required to prevent the surge of virus. Instructing all the districts to continue aggressive testing and contact tracing and testing to check the spread of the pandemic, she said epidemiologists have been appointed in all the districts and all-out efforts should be made to thwart the possible third Covid wave. Quoting the forecast from University of Cambridge, Mahajan said going with the forecast, new cases can be expected to double in about 64 days (under the assumption that the growth rate remains constant). She expressed satisfaction over the fact that 2,45,823 samples have been taken in the past week from August 3 to 9, and only 352 had tested positive, which accounted for a positivity rate of 0.1%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-govt-orders-10-000-covid-tests-in-schools-daily-101628707771411.html

During the five-day remand, we will interrogate the accused regarding the motive behind the heinous crime. We have also created a re-scene of the events at the crime spot,” the SHO added.The incident had come to light on Tuesday when the Rai police had received postmortem reports of both the minor girls from a Delhi hospital which confirmed that they were gangraped and some pesticide was used to poison them.On Monday, the victims’ mother had told police that her daughters, who were undergoing treatment at a Delhi hospital, had died.She had told police that a snake had attacked them when they were asleep at their rented home in Sonepat’s Kundli area on August 5.But after police received the postmortem reports, she confessed that the girls were gangraped and poisoned by the accused, who had threatened to kill her minor sons if she revealed it to anyone.Police had arrested all four accused under Sections 302 (murder), 376-D (gang rape), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance with common intention), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Sections 4, 6 and 12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/minor-sisters-gangrape-murder-accused-sent-to-five-day-police-remand-101628707653106.html

As the water levels of the two rivers stabilised between 12 noon and 4pm, the administration is hopeful that the water would now start receding from Thursday onwards. “We have reasons to believe that the flood water would start receding from Thursday as the upstream of river Yamuna and its tributary has not received heavy rains. Once the water level in Yamuna would recede, the same would have a positive impact in water level in Ganga as well,” said executive engineer of the irrigation department, Brijesh Kumar Verma. At present, both the rivers are flowing one meter above their danger mark. However, as per the readings at 6pm, both the rivers had again started rising though at a slow pace. Water level in both the river Ganga and the Yamuna, as recorded at 8am by the irrigation department on Wednesday, was above the danger mark and the water levels showed a rising trend. Water level of Ganga at Phaphamau was 86.05 m (rising at a speed of 1.5cm per hour) while at Chhatnag, the water level was recorded at 85.19 meters (rising at a speed of 1cm per hour). Likewise, the water level in river Yamuna was recorded at Naini 85.73 m (rising at a speed of .5cm per hour). The rising trend of water level in Ganga was seen till 12noon after which the water started receding, although at a slow pace. The trend continued till around 4pm after which the water became stable. At the same time, water level in river Yamuna, which was showing an increasing trend for the past one week, became stable on early Wednesday evening. The water level (as recorded at 4pm) of Ganga at Phaphamau was 86.03m and at Chhatnag, it was 85.27m. Water level of Yamuna too was stable and was recorded as 85.77m. However, the reading at 6pm showed that Ganga at Phaphamau was flowing at 86.04 meters while at Chhatnag at was flowing at 85.29 meters and rising. Likewise, Yamuna at was recorded at 85.78 meters at 6pm and was found rising. Meanwhile, the district administration and the NDRF team continued to provide help to the locals trapped in the flood affected localities and to those who have been shifted to flood relief camps established at various places in the city. Along with providing food and all the essential items, the administration is also conducting corona tests in the camps so that people residing in the camps are safe. Special attention is being paid for maintaining hygiene but in few camps, people were see complaining about the same. Likewise, in the flood affected areas including Chota and Bada Bagada, Salori, Ganga Nagar, parts of Gaus Nagar etc, district administration, NDRF teams and even local voluntary organisations and leaders of political parties including those belonging to Samajwadi Party distributed food packets and other essential items through boats and by walking in knee-deep waters. In most of these localities, locals have either moved to first and second floors of their houses or have locked their houses and moved to flood relief camps. People also experienced some relief as city did not received rains after around 3pm. Since past two days, the city had been receiving heavy rains which had added to the suffering of the flood affected people of Sangam city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ganga-yamuna-levels-stabilise-prayagraj-officials-hopeful-of-rivers-receding-101628707352876.html
12-08-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana revenue dept notifies policy for creating land bank||With the twin objectives of preventing landowners from resorting to distress sale of land and making it available to different departments for setting up essential public services, the Haryana revenue department on Wednesday notified a policy for creating land bank.According to the policy, the revenue department will consolidate such chunks of surplus land as had been acquired by the departments under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, but does not need now, and provide it to the departments that need them.This will help the state overcome difficulties in making land available to departments, said financial commissioner (revenue) and additional chief secretary (ACS) Sanjeev Kaushal.He said it has been observed that landowners, especially those living abroad, make distress sale of land due to plethora of reasons such as slump in market, pandemic or pressure of the middlemen in the market. He said the land bank will offer a win-win situation for departments, landowners/farmers and the state government.While the former will be able to sell land at a competitive price, the latter will not have to look the other way when any department knocks at their doors for land to set up public utilities, Kaushal said.He said the bank will provide land to departments for setting up essential services including water works, power sub-stations, colleges and other specialised institutions of higher learning such as universities, medical colleges, hospitals and polytechnics, etc.The land bank will be set up under the policy for purchase of land voluntarily offered to government for development projects, creating land bank for government department, including boards and corporations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-revenue-dept-notifies-policy-for-creating-land-bank-101628707351456.html

The work is all set to start to revamp the facilities at the depot.The UPSRTC has decided to develop this depot on public-private partnership (PPP) model on priority. To initiate the process for developing the bus terminal-cum-commercial complex on the basis of DBFOT (Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer), UPSRTC has floated a tender. “UPSRTC has floated the tender to develop the Civil Lines bus depot following which the passengers would be offered a range of facilities like better waiting facilities, information about the timing of buses and routes etc besides shops and cafeterias”, said regional manager UPSRTC, TKS Bisen.The Civil Lines Bus depot area spread across 18,000 sq meters would be developed at a cost of ₹114 crore to become not just a hub of inter-state and intra-state bus services but also a commercially booming centre for UPSRTC, said officials. After the process for allotment of work for developing the Civil Lines depot on the lines of Alambagh bus depot in Lucknow, this bus stand of Sangam city would also be included in the list of premium bus station cum commercial complexes of the state, they added. Officials said that the final execution of work, which would be allotted to an agency selected via the tendering process, would pave for a new station building which would have AC waiting halls, food courts, business centres, showrooms of branded and non-branded products, shopping mall, canteens, AC and non-AC rooms for passengers to stay besides many other world class facilities based on pay and use model. A luggage checking scanner, as is operated at railway stations and airports, will also be installed at the bus stand for better security. Besides, there would be separate platforms for the buses going towards a given direction and systematic information about the same would be displayed at the electronic boards which would be installed at several places over the entire complex. The haphazard parking of the buses, both operated by UPSRTC and those attached with it, would also become a thing of the past. Presently, these buses are major cause of traffic jams in front of the bus stand as most of the private bus operators, who are attached to UPSRTC, park their buses on the road while inviting passengers for given destinations. Likewise, the buses, operated by UPSRTC are parked within the premises of the bus stand, but finding the bus for a given destination is a tedious task. Following the revamp of facilities, passengers can look forward to having better seating areas, cleaner toilets, ease of travelling and better satisfaction, officials claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-civil-lines-bus-depot-set-for-a-revamp-101628706812148.html

A hashtag demanding his removal was trending on the afternoon of August 4. The video showed a man asking another person about the ownership of a mazaar on the road in Adarsh Nagar. The man was asking the second person where he lived and sought an explanation as to why the mazaar was on the road, as it was blocking traffic. Inspector Bhardwaj is seen intervening between the two men and reminding the first person that he should not bully the other person.In the video, Bhardwaj, who identifies himself as the SHO of Adarsh Nagar police station, can be seen reminding the first person that for any disputed structure, the government has a committee to examine its legality. To this, the first man is seen asking Bhardwaj why a temple was demolished in Chandni Chowk. The viral video ends with the inspector taking the first man into custody.As reports of Bhardwaj’s suspension went public on Wednesday, many people on Twitter said he was suspended for taking action against a right-wing protester. Others opined police did the right thing because the inspector was hand in glove with the land mafia, who encroach on public roads.No senior police officer, authorised to speak to the media, commented on the reasons behind Bhardwaj’s suspension. However, a senior police officer, who asked not to be named, said, “The controversy over the mazaar and the viral video has nothing to do with his suspension. No one was arrested in that incident. No complaint was filed in that incident. He has been suspended because there were many complaints against him for dereliction of duty. In some cases, he did not use the correct Indian Penal Code sections and diluted the case. He also did not act on some complaints.” Bhardwaj’s personal cellphone was unavailable when HT tried to call on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/inspector-suspended-a-week-after-viral-video-101628706695300.html
12-08-2021||Other||Sugarcane crop in Haryana under pest attack||The sugarcane growers in Haryana are having a bitter experience as the crop is under a pest attack, largely known as top-borer.Farmers in major cane-growing districts - Yamunanagar, Karnal and Kurukshetra - are badly affected and are spending a lot on pesticides to protect their crop.As per agriculture experts, two major diseases, top-borer and pokka boeing, have been reported in sugarcane and the Co 0238, (which is around 40% of the total sugarcane acreage in state), is badly affected. It could cause 20-30% yield loss.Farmers said there is no major impact on the Co 118 and CoH 160 varieties ofthe crop.“I have spent ₹52,000 on pesticides so far to protect my sugarcane crop on 14 acres. As of now, there is no visible impact on the pest attack which is spreading with each passing day,” said farmer Desh Raj, of Karnal’s Yunispur village.Another farmer Ajay Kumar, of Indri in Karnal who has 20 acres under sugarcane crop, said, “The pest affects growth of the crop by damaging the leaves. Last year it had affected the yield to around 100-200 quintal per acre. It may cause huge losses this year as well.”Experts said top-borer is harmful for the sugarcane crop as it completes five generations or broods in a year. It remains active from February to October and damages growth of the cane crop.The first two broods of the pest attack the young plants; and the third and fourth generations cause maximum damage in August and September.The affected plants are killed from the top and there is a possibility of loss to the crop as the pest migrates to another shoot after killing the first one.Rajinder Kaushik, deputy general manager, Saraswati Sugar Mill in Yamunanagar, said, “This is the third brood of the top-borer pest. It has affected the Co 0238 variety the most and is going to have a major impact on the yield. Farmers should protect the crop from the fourth brood, which is generally reported in September.”He said the long dry spell in June and early July was also a major reason behind the multiplication of the pest. He advised farmers to use Carbofuran-3g to lessen the impact of the pest and break the multiplication cycle.Sugarcane expert and member secretary of Haryana Kisan Ayog Dr Mehar Chand said, “The cane crop is under a severe attack of top-borer. It is a difficult stage for farmers to protect the crop as the crop has already attained growth of over six feet. We recommend Carbofuran to control the pest attack but at this stage it is difficult to use the pesticide.”He advised farmers to use pesticides in May and June to control the pest as at later stages it is difficult to control the pest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sugarcane-crop-in-haryana-under-pest-attack-101628706694866.html
12-08-2021||Delhi||Probe leaks: Delhi HC says serious issue, pulls up police||Hearing a plea by Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha seeking action against the police officials for allegedly leaking his disclosure statement to the media, the Delhi high court on Wednesday remarked that leak of documents and probe details was a “serious issue” and that the investigating agency must ensure that it is not done selectively.“It is a case where there is an order of this court that press briefing will not be done, so to circumvent that what you do is… you don’t do a press briefing but somehow… I am not imputing to any particular officer… but somehow in the form of leakage everything comes out... that is not permissible,” said the court of justice Mukta Gupta, adding that an investigation report is a valuable property.“Why has this happened? There has to be a definite answer; secondly, it should not happen in future. Of course, you can take remedial action, but advisories don’t have any effect. Every time some cover-up is made,” it added.Last week, the police had informed the court that it had failed to identify the officers/office from where “details of investigation” were “shared with the media”, adding that journalists have refused to divulge their source.Appearing for the police, additional solicitor general (ASG) Aman Lekhi on Wednesday told the court that an enquiry has already been made and further probe into the source of the leaks would foment trouble.He said that police was in the process of issuing a circular to preempt and prevent a repeat of such incidents.The court, however, said that the advisories don’t work and sought to know how the statements came in the media much earlier.Lekhi pointed out that since it was a UAPA case, which involves several administrative processes, the file goes to different places where several copies must have been made.The court asked the police to file written submissions and posted the matter for September 8.Tanha, who is accused in the larger conspiracy of hatching the riots in February last year, had moved the high court last year, alleging misconduct by police officials in leaking his alleged disclosure statement in the main charge sheet, recorded by the probe agency during the investigation, to the media. He is currently out on bail.Tanha, who was arrested in May 2020, was recently released from jail after the high court granted him bail in the riots case on a larger conspiracy.The police had said that Tanha, a resident of Abul Fazal Enclave in Shaheen Bagh, was a member of the Students Islamic Organization and was part of the Jamia Coordination Committee which spearheaded protests against the new citizenship law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/probe-leaks-delhi-hc-says-serious-issue-pulls-up-police-101628706630785.html
12-08-2021||Delhi||RTO at your door: 90+% transport services in Delhi go ‘faceless’ in online push||Delhi residents can avail of 33 transport documents online without visiting a regional transport office after the Delhi government on Wednesday launched the “faceless transport services” programme, which pushes online 95% of all travel-related paperwork, and has allowed the state to shut four of its busiest transport offices in Sarai Kale Khan, IP Depot, Vasant Vihar, and Janakpuri.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal launched the service from the IP Depot RTO on Wednesday, after which he and state transport minister Kailash Gahlot locked the gate of the office, a symbolic gesture to announce the closure of the centre.“The Delhi government has taken a revolutionary step. Only an honest government could make this possible. Earlier, we used to hear that the fee that agents in the RTOs took went all the way to the top government officers. But now, it does not go anywhere — neither in the pockets of the agents nor of the top brass. This online faceless system has eradicated the need for agents and the chance of corruption,” Kejriwal said on Wednesday.The project, a first in India, allows an applicant to appear for a learners’ driving license test from home.On passing the test, the applicant is issued an e-learners’ license valid for six months.To avoid any proxy test attempt — since it is no longer undertaken at an RTO under a licensing officer’s supervision — the software extracts the applicant’s data and picture from their Aadhaar card, and draws out their facial map using a live recognition system to match it with the image on the card. The test also includes a colour-blind test to match the road safety prescribed standards. All documents are digitally signed by the authorities and applicants, and delivered either through post or electronically.The online learners’ licence test, which has 10 objective-type questions, takes 10 minutes to complete. An applicant gets the licence if they score six out of 10 marks in the computerised test.Delhi has 13 RTOs, of which these four have been shut for public dealing. To be sure, all the 10 driving test tracks in the city will continue to be operational as a learners’ license is valid for only six months and the motorist has to apply for a permanent DL within this time. To get a permanent DL, a person will still have to visit an RTO to appear for a driving test on the government’s automated tracks.Other online services include renewal and duplicate driving licence (DL) or vehicle registration certificate (RC), permit or RC transfer and so on.“All [transport] services can now be accessed online. Only two services require you to come to the RTO now — to give a driving test for a permanent DL, for which all processes till the actual test, including the appointment and fees, have already been made online; and to get the fitness of your vehicle checked... All departments are under the process of going faceless and online,” Kejriwal said.The state transport department began a trial of this project with 12 faceless services in February this year. Over the course of the five-month trial, the department carried out 342,000 transactions. Reports of the trial showed that the department achieved a transaction success rate of 80% in this period, and a rejection rate of 1%. The remaining 19% of the applications are on hold for want of documents.Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said no applicant will be required to go to an RTO or transport department zonal office.“Whether you are at home, office or a cyber cafe, you can get all the documents that you used to get till now by visiting an RTO. In the 75th year of India’s independence, this is a great gift from the Delhi government to the residents of Delhi. Now they have total freedom from long queues, brokers or middlemen,” said Gahlot.An applicant can also call the Delhi government’s doorstep service delivery helpline number (1076), if they need assistance, said officials.“Apart from this, three deputy commissioners in Surajmal Vihar, Dwarka and Sarai Kale Khan will also address grievances,” Gahlot said.Ashish Kundra, Delhi’s transport commissioner said the department has also set up a WhatsApp chatbot to assist commuters, and details are on the department’s website (transport.delhi.gov.in).Several motorists lauded the service.Cheshta Mehta, a resident of Palam Village in southwest Delhi, was the first to get an e-learner’s license under the new system. “At first, I assumed that faceless services meant only the application process was online. But, I took the test at my home and on my laptop. if you upload the correct documents, the entire process is a breeze. I am sure many states will replicate this online system now. It saved me a day’s salary because otherwise I would have to take an off from office to visit the RTO for the test,” she said.Yatharth Gera (43), a resident of Paschim Vihar, said the service helped him transfer the ownership of his vehicle. “I had to transfer my car to a relative’s name, and the faceless service made it completely stress-free. I hope they do not compromise with the quality of service after a few months or years,” he said.For those do not have internet connections or are unable to use the online services, however, the department is setting up facilitation centres at all its 13 RTOs, including the four that were shut on Wednesday. Also, the same service can be availed by dialling 1076 and using the government’s already existing doorstep delivery of service scheme.The 33 services have been merged with the doorstep delivery setup as well. “A nominal fee of ₹50 will be charged to complete the online process at the facilitation centres at RTOs and through the doorstep delivery system,” a senior transport official said.The official added that nearly 100% Delhi’s population of vehicle owners are Aadhaar seeded, which makes the online system simpleer for the applicants. But those who still do not have Aadhaar cards will have to visit the RTO after applying online. “They will, however, have the option to file online applications,” the official said, adding that the facilitators at all RTOs will help in this regard too.Officials also clarified that no transport office employee was relieved of their duty after the RTOs were shut. “All officials and workers were overburdened under the existing system as annually Delhi clocks around 3 million transactions from the 13 RTOs. So, under the new system, it has helped us optimise our resources. Some of the MLOs have now been put on road safety and enforcement duty,” a senior transport official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rto-at-your-door-90-transport-services-in-delhi-go-faceless-in-online-push-101628706572785.html

Nitesh was supporting and helping his brother Pravesh in the case,” said DCP Tayal, adding that at least three other suspects involved in Nitesh’s murder are still absconding.On July 31, Nitesh was riding his bike when five assailants on two bikes waylaid his vehicle and opened fire at him. According to police, at least eight of the 12 bullets fired hit Nitesh, following which he died on the spot.A case of murder and firing was registered at the Kanjhawala police station on the complaint of Nitesh’s sister-in-law Priti, police said.During the investigation, DCP Tayal said, the suspects were identified with the help of CCTV footage and human intelligence network. “We first arrested Akshay on August 4. His interrogation led to the arrest of Suraj on August 10. One pistol with two cartridges, a mobile phone and a motorcycle that was used in the crime were recovered from them,” added DCP Tayal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi2-held-for-murder-in-gang-war-in-north-delhi-101628706570696.html

Conspiracy is no doubt hatched behind closed doors and that the investigation in the present matter is at nascent stage that however, does not imply that liberty of a citizen be curtailed on mere assertions and apprehension,” the magistrate said in his order.The police arrested Upadhyay on Tuesday over allegations that he organised the event, and went ahead despite the rejection of permission to conduct it by the cops. The police booked him for promoting enmity between religious groups, disobedience of the orders of a public servant and unlawful assembly.The court on Tuesday sent him to judicial custody for two days after the police did not seek his custodial interrogation. The duty magistrate also directed that the bail application, moved by Upadhyay’s counsel Ashwani Dubey, be heard on Wednesday in the morning.Allowing Upadhyay’s release from Tihar jail on a bond of ₹50,000, the court said all the sections under which the accused has been charged are bailable except 153A (promoting enmity between two religious groups).The court rejected prosecution’s contention related to the violation of Covid-19 curbs on social gatherings, saying that it is a difficult time indeed for everyone and serious view should be taken against those who violate the guidelines. Yet, the offences, as far as the breach of these guidelines is concerned, are bailable in nature and can be dealt by the trial court on merits, the magistrate said.The court ordered that Upadhyay will continue to cooperate with the ongoing investigations, and not leave the country without its permission.Appearing for Upadhyay, senior advocate Vikas Singh told the court that the arrest is a “blatant abuse of power by the police”. He said the police cannot apprehend anyone indiscriminately, adding that it was an admitted fact that the accused was present at the spot but not at the time when the hate speech incident took place there.Senior advocates Sidharth Luthra and Gopal Shankarnarayan, representing Upadhyay, also said that the accused was not present at the spot when the sloganeering was made and he was also not seen in the videos. They said that the FIR was registered belatedly and their client was being illegally incarcerated and, therefore, bail should be granted to the accused forthwith.The public prosecutor Sikhar (OR SHIKHAR, PLS CHECK) Mahajan, opposed the bail plea contending that the release of the accused will be prejudicial in maintaining public tranquillity, and will create further serious law and order situation. He said there are chances that the accused will create communal disharmony.The prosecutor argued that the protest was done at a time when large gatherings are not allowed to prevent the spread of Covid-19, and that the gathering was held without official permission.“The gathering organised by the accused was an unlawful assembly in which he actively participated knowing the common object of the gathering,” he argued.The court granted the bail to Upadhyay and directed him to join the probe as and when summoned by the investigating officer.A video showing anti-Muslim slogans being raised during a protest at Jantar Mantar was widely circulated on social media, following which the Delhi Police registered a case in connection on Monday. Hundreds of people attended the protest organised by ‘Bharat Jodo Aandolan’ at Jantar Mantar on Sunday.Shipra Srivastava, media in-charge of Bharat Jodo Aandolan, said the protest was held to demand 222 British-era laws be abolished. “We have seen the video but have no idea who they are. The police should take strict action against the persons who raised the slogans,” she said on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hate-slogans-bjp-leader-gets-bail-101628706451384.html
12-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt inks pact with IB Board for new state board’s curriculum||The Delhi government on Wednesday signed an agreement between the International Baccalaureate (IB) board to adopt its global curriculum framework for the upcoming Delhi Board of School Education (DBSE) and also develop a new assessment model.“IB curriculum is a pedagogy of the highest international standards... It is a massive opportunity for students. The kind of education which kids of the richest of the families dream of will be made accessible to the underprivileged students of Delhi,” said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who was joined by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev, and other education department officials, at the signing in ceremony.According to the state government’s plan, the curriculum framework will be provided by IB while the Directorate of Education (DoE) will prepare the content as per the framework.“We are starting out with 30 government schools, whose teachers will be trained by international experts and models for assessment of students will be developed by them. Under their guidance and assistance, the schools will be inspected, verified, and certified, to assess the shortcomings and how it can be improved. Gradually, more schools will be added to the programme, even private schools can get affiliated to DBSE,” Kejriwal said.An IB official said the partnership will ensure “rich learning experiences” for educators. “This partnership entails that IB development workshops provide opportunities to engage in rich learning experiences for the school leaders and educators and serve as a tool to help schools meet professional requirements of the highest quality,” said Stefanie Leong, Head of Development and Recognition, Asia-Pacific, IB.Last month, the Delhi government announced that out of the 30 schools identified for the new programme, 20 will be Schools of Specialised Excellence (SoSE) offering specialised education in four domains -- Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM); Humanities; Performing and Visual Arts; and “high- end 21st century skills” -- and the remaining 10 will be Sarvodaya schools.On March 22, the Delhi cabinet approved setting up 100 schools of specialised excellence across the city for students of classes 9 to 12. The existing resource-rich government schools – including Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya and Schools of Excellence – have been converted into SoSE.Role of IB BoardThe IB board will work as a knowledge partner with DBSE which is also being provided technical and managerial support by Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) and Boston Consulting Group (BCG).Government officials said that the IB will provide the curriculum framework for the state board schools in addition to training its teachers, sharing best assessment practices, conducting seminars and workshops on global teaching-learning process, and conducting continuous reviews and inspections.“More than 400 teachers in Sarvodaya schools and 250 teachers in SoSEs will be part of the professional development workshops by IB which will help in capacity building and upskilling. About 15,000 students studying in these schools will benefit from the collaboration with IB,” said a senior education department official.IB has four dedicated programmes -- primary years programme (PYP), middle years programme (MYP), diploma programme (DP), and career-related programme (CP) -- for students aged 3-19 that can be adopted by any school upon gaining authorisation from the board. Sarvodaya schools will adopt PYP from nursery to Class 5 and MYP for classes 6 to 8, officials said, adding that the specialised schools (SoSEs) will run MYP for classes 9 and 10, and DP as well as CP for classes 11 and 12.Admissions to SoSEOn Wednesday, DoE also released a circular stating that admissions to these schools will be on the basis of aptitude tests that will be conducted from August 23-29. Applications for the same can be downloaded from the education department’s website from August 12-19.“Admissions shall be offered in Class 9 in all four types of SoSEs. For STEM SoSE, besides Class 9, admission will also be offered in Class 11. Students in any government or recognised schools of Delhi are eligible to apply for admission (along with valid residence proof),” DoE circular stated.This means that students from private schools will be eligible to apply to these institutes, as against the earlier system which allowed only government school students to apply to the resource-rich government schools. However, the government has reserved 50% seats in each SoSE for students from government schools. “Reservation and age-related eligibility criteria for admission is as per norms of the Directorate,” the circular added.According to the norms, students need to have a minimum aggregate of 60% in Class 8 to apply to these schools though applicants to schools of performing and visual arts can get a relaxation if they have received an award in any art form in a zonal level competition or above.A minimum aggregate of 75% in Class 10 is required for admission in Class 11 of STEM schools where the best of five score should include science and maths.These schools will have 30 students per section and each school is likely to have three-four sections in the first year, taking the class strength up to 90-120 students.ReactionsSeveral government school principals HT spoke to welcomed the globalised teaching-learning process.Ajay Choubey, head of school at RPVV Hari Nagar which will be a SoSE for STEM, said, “IB will help us with teacher training for a year to ensure that staff are able to teach the new curriculum. We are hoping to start teaching-learning from September first week. The present batch of classes 9 and 11 will also be given an option to either appear from the CBSE board or switch to DBSE. The students will easily transition to the new curricular framework as well as content if they wish to switch to the new board.”However, the switch to IB has found a few detractors in the teaching community.Ajay Veer Yadav, general secretary of the Government School Teachers’ Association (GSTA), said, “Instead of opening new schools, the government is busy renaming old schools. In 2016 too, the government had announced that 51 government schools would become model schools at par with private schools. Now they have come up with something else again. Dividing schools as per stream will be a failure because this will limit the number of schools for children.”Meanwhile, officials of schools currently following the IB curriculum in Delhi said it will offer more opportunities to students.“Public schools in countries like USA, South Korea, Spain, and Germany have entered into partnerships with IB as it is one of the most renowned international board. While boards like CBSE conduct exams in classes 10 and 12, IB board provides curriculum that works on the basis of constructivist theory which means that students construct their own knowledge through an inquiry-based process. Many of the principles stated in the new National Education Policy reflect with the curriculum provided by IB,” said a senior official from Apeejay School International in Sheikh Sarai, one of the well-known IB schools in Delhi, requesting not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-inks-pact-with-ib-board-for-new-state-board-s-curriculum-101628706211376.html
12-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi child rights body sends DDA suggestions on Capital’s 2041 Master Plan||The state body of child rights has suggested a slew of measures, such as creating more spaces for children in the Capital and changing land norms for educational institutions, to the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) after a review of the draft Master Plan of Delhi 2041.The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) wrote a letter to the land-owning agency on Wednesday broadly covering five concerns. DCPCR chairperson Anurag Kundu said, “Based on the review, DCPCR has submitted its suggestions to DDA that range from earmarking more spaces for children and more creche facilities to reconsider land norms for educational institutes and diaper changing stations in public toilets.”In the letter, the child rights body said that currently, 30% of Delhi’s population is below the age of 18, and the overall population of Delhi is expected to grow to about 39 million. Assuming, 30% of the overall population is still comprised of children, there will be around 11.7 million children in Delhi by 2041.In its letter to the DDA, the commission pointed out, “These many children would require the state to ensure availability of... schools, colleges, anganwadi centres, child health centres, childcare institutions, paediatric wards, playground/parks etc.”The commission also endorsed creating more crèche facilities to enable more women to join the workforce. “Availability of sanitary pads and robust disposal systems at public utility places is a key area of focus that the Commission recommends for the Authority,” said the DCPCR letter issued by the chairperson.Kundu also explained the need to modify land norms for educational institutes in the Capital and link it to number of children it caters to instead of having a blanket minimum size.“As per the draft Master Plan, development control norms for the educational institutions such as learning centre/creche states that minimum plot area for such institutions shall be 500 sq. meters with 10% variation in the size. However, past experience suggests, this approach of blanket cover of imposing a particular size limit serves little purpose as a lot of institutions do not fulfil these conditions and are thus rendered unregulated,” he wrote in the letter.The commission has also asked DDA to make the infrastructure in the city more parent-friendly. “It is hard to carry a child for hours [in public places]. Parenting is hard and our infrastructure must make it easier. This requires re-envisaging our footpaths, roads, buses, and every other component of infrastructure,” said the letter. Apart from this, the commission also advocated for diaper changing facilities in public toilets for both men and women.A message from HT to a DDA official requesting comment on the matter received no response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-child-rights-body-sends-dda-suggestions-on-capital-s-2041-master-plan-101628706153950.html
12-08-2021||Delhi||Dalit girl’s rape-murder: Family cremates charred remains amid tight security||The charred remains of a nine-year-old Dalit girl, who was allegedly raped and killed by four men at a crematorium in Purani Nangal near Delhi Cantonment on August 1, were cremated on Wednesday by her parents amid tight security and a protest carried by a group demanding the death penalty for the suspects.Deputy commissioner of police (south-west) Ingit Pratap Singh said the last rites were performed with “full willingness” of the girl’s parents, who were at the crematorium with 15-20 close acquaintances. After the rituals, police personnel accompanied the parents to their house as, officials said, they were apprehensive of action by a group of protesters opposed to the cremation. The DCP said there was no untoward incident.Hours before the cremation on Wednesday, the four arrested men, including the 55-year-old priest of the crematorium, were taken to the spot by the crime branch team to recreate the sequence of events leading to the minor girl’s death.The suspects — the priest and three other crematorium staff — were arrested and sent to jail on August 2.The crime branch team secured their custody for three days on Monday to reinterrogate them and ascertain the facts pertaining to the girl’s death.The suspects told police that the girl was electrocuted while fetching water from a water cooler installed at the crematorium. However, the hurried manner in which her body was cremated — purportedly without her parents’ consent or informing the police — raised suspicions about the circumstances of her death.A board of three doctors conducted an autopsy on the charred remains of the girl on Tuesday, after which the remains were preserved at the mortuary of Deen Dayal Upadhyay (DDU) hospital. Though the family initially refused to collect the remains and perform the last rites, they agreed on Wednesday after persuasion by the police, said a senior officer who did not want to be identified.“The family received the remaining human tissue and feet of the minor girl from the hospital and came to the Purani Nangal crematorium, where they performed the cremation in presence of 15-20 of their known acquaintances,” DCP Singh said.The DCP said 25-30 people, “who were part of a group holding protest in a nearby tent”, tried to intervene but the parents did not concede to their demand of stopping the cremation.A local resident, Aarti, who has been protesting since day one, said: “We had no objection to the cremation. All we want is justice for the girl. That can be provided when the arrested men are given the death penalty.”The girl, from a Dalit family, in Purani Nangal, was found dead by her parents in a local crematorium on August 1 night. The family alleges that the accused — the priest Radhey Shyam, and three other men working at the crematorium – Mohammad Salim (55), Laxmi Narayan (49), and Kuldeep (63) — raped her.The incident took a political turn after a host of leaders, including the Congress’s Rahul Gandhi and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal visited the protest site and met the girl’s parents and assured them of speedy justice. The BJP, however, accused the Opposition of politicking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dalit-girl-s-rape-murder-family-cremates-charred-remains-amid-tight-security-101628706150757.html

12-08-2021||Delhi||25 trees on Bhairon Marg damaged during construction, says Delhi government||A healthy mulberry tree that now stands tilted with its roots protruding out of the ground can be spotted easily while crossing Bhairon Marg, near Pragati Maidan. Another full-grown neem and a tall peepal, also on the same stretch, are almost losing balance, being partially uprooted from the ground.These are among at least 25 trees whose bases were damaged during construction work by the public works department (PWD), according to an inspection report of the site prepared by the Delhi forest department.The PWD is constructing stormwater drains on both sides of the road. Due to the trenching and digging work within a one-metre radius of the tree trunks, the tree line on both sides of the road has been damaged.Some of the trees can already be seen leaning over the road as their roots have been tampered with. And heavy rain or a storm could knock them down.Forest officials said they had on Friday issued a restraining order to the road-owning agency, asking them to stop work on the stretch immediately.“A restraining order has been issued to the agency. Also, we have registered a case against the PWD under the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act (DPTA), 1994, for damaging roots of at least 25 trees because of which some have even tilted. Most of the trees are native varieties and range from 15 to 25 feet in height,” said Navneet Srivastava, deputy conservator of forest (DCF), west division, adding that PWD’s version will be heard too after which they will be asked to take remedial measures.“We will be constantly monitoring the status of the trees,” Srivastava said.A senior PWD official said work on the stretch has been stopped. “The contractors taking up the work are aware that trees on the way need to be protected during construction work. We will take up restorative measures if the trees have been damaged,” said the official, who did not wish to be named.The matter came to light when environmental activist Verhaen Khanna filed a complaint with the forest department and the PWD, seeking a restraining order on the PWD and corrective measures to save the trees.“The tree roots were cut during trenching work, which is being done by the PWD workers on both sides of the road. The construction is being done within a one-metre radius of the tree bases. Many trees could be spotted tilting and losing their balance because of their roots being uprooted from one end. This can eventually result in the tree falling or dying, in particular during the monsoon,” said Khanna.He added that fresh soil must be laid over the exposed roots and the cement that has been put too close to the tree base must be removed. “If restored now, the trees can be saved,” he said.Most of the trees on the stretch are native species like semal, ashok, neem, mulberry (shehtoot) and peepal, among others.Any kind of construction activity including, digging, trenching or filling concrete within a one-metre radius of a tree base is prohibited as per the 2013 order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) as well as under the DPTA. The offenders are liable to pay compensation depending on the extent of the damage caused to trees.A 2014 NGT order had also stated that agencies must ensure root protection while constructing stormwater drains and cover exposed portions with soil immediately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/25-trees-on-bhairon-marg-damaged-during-construction-says-delhi-government-101628705731874.html
12-08-2021||Chandigarh||Delhi HC allows black money Act accused Bhavya Bishnoi to travel to US||A division bench of the Delhi high court (HC) has allowed Bhavya Bishnoi, the son of Adampur MLA Kuldeep Bishnoi, to travel to the United States to study masters in public administration at Harvard Kennedy School for two years, subject to certain conditions, including the surrender of passports by father and son.Bhavya, who unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Hisar on a Congress ticket, and his father are accused under the black money Act.The bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh, while upholding the August 4 order of single judge justice Rekha Palli to permit Bhavya to travel to the US for studies on August 9, said he is being permitted to travel subject to compliance of the conditions imposed by the single judge and abiding by the undertaking given to the court.The income tax authorities had challenged the order of the single judge before the division bench. The single judge had also ordered that Kuldeep Bishnoi will file an undertaking before the high court registrar general that he will not leave the country as long as his son is abroad.“The registrar general will keep passports of Kuldeep Bishnoi in safe custody in a sealed cover. As and when he requires the passports for genuine and valid reasons, he may apply to this court for permission,” said the division bench.The bench also accepted Bhavya’s undertaking that he will surrender his passport with the authorities concerned at the Indian Embassy in the US within a week of reaching Harvard. In case he requires it for a genuine cause, he can apply before the court.‘Sanction to prosecute Bishnoi’s granted’The counsel for the Union government had submitted before the single judge that the sanction for the prosecution of the father and son under Section 50 of the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015 (Black Money Act), a cognisable and non-bailable offence, has already been granted.“In fact, a complaint in this regard stands filed before additional chief metropolitan magistrate, special Acts, Tis Hazari, in accordance with law. The complaint is likely to be taken up for consideration in the next few days and so, in case the petitioner is permitted to go abroad, the proceedings already initiated under the Black Money Act against him may be rendered infructuous,” the counsel had told the single judge.Look out circular stands expired?Bhavya’s counsel had contended before the single judge that a look out circular (LOC) against him was issued in 2019 at the behest of the income tax authorities, a fact which came to his knowledge only in November 2019, when he was stopped from boarding a flight to Dubai at the Delhi airport.The single judge, in her order, said the question of whether the LOC issued in 2019 can now stand in the way of the petitioner travelling abroad is yet to be determined.The judge said though the income tax department claims to have already filed a complaint against Bhavya for an offence under the Black Money Act, no cognisance has been taken of the complaint.Bhavya’s counsel also submitted before the division bench that the competent authority, during the search and seizure proceedings, had seized assets of his and his family members valued at ₹30.38 crore. This is over and above the condition imposed by the single judge directing him to deposit ₹1 crore with the high court registrar general.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/delhi-hc-allows-black-money-act-accused-bhavya-bishnoi-us-travel-101628705611190.html
12-08-2021||Pune||Only 0.1% of vax beneficiaries in Pune have contracted Covid||PUNE Barely 0.1% of those who have received at least one shot of the anti-Covid-19 vaccine have contracted the virus in Pune district, data from the district health office has revealed, indicating that breakthrough infections recorded in the Maharashtra district are minimal. Out of the 6.3 million beneficiaries who have taken the vaccine until August 6, only 7,636 tested positive for Covid-19. Only 2,170 tested positive for the infection out of the 1.64 million who have got both doses of the vaccine. “The aim of the vaccine is to ensure that the severity of the symptoms is reduced and even if that is done the spread of the transmission and the death rate could be controlled,” said state advisor on Covid-19 Dr Subhash Salunkhe. The data comes at a time when the state has relaxed lockdown restrictions in at least 25 districts, including Pune, which has been one of the worst affected in both waves of the pandemic. It also seems to corroborate studies that have found a low incidence of breakthrough infections among vaccinated people. Double vaccinated people were three times less likely than unvaccinated people to test positive for the coronavirus, an ongoing REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT-1) programme led by Imperial’s School of Public Health, has found. In the latest round of the study, which will be submitted for peer-review, 98,233 people swabbed themselves at home and their samples were analysed by PCR testing. People who were unvaccinated had a three-fold higher prevalence than those who had received both doses of a vaccine, at 1.21% compared to 0.40%, the Imperial College London, reported. A total of 4.68 million beneficiaires have got the first vaccine dose in Pune (both Covaxin and Covishield) out of which only 5,466 reported being reinfected, the Pune district data revealed. “Such data will also reduce vaccine hesitancy among a number of people who still question the efficacy of the vaccines,” Salunkhe said.Out of the total positives 7636, who got infected even after vaccination, 3413 are from Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) jurisdiction, 88 are from Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and 4135 are from Pune rural “This data is not surprising because all across the world we have found that while people who have taken both shots of the vaccine may get infected, the need for hospitalization, intensive care or ventilators reduces drastically. This means the case fatality due to the infection also falls,” Arnub Ghose, Associate Professor at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/01-of-beneficiaries-have-contracted-covid-19-after-vax-district-health-office-101628699310294.html
12-08-2021||Pune||Four districts in Maha report single digit new Covid cases||PUNE In the past week, multiple districts in the state have reported zero, or just single- digit new Covid-19 cases. These districts include, Bhandara, Gondia, Nandurbar and Wardha. The combined positivity rate in these districts has also stayed less than 1%. In addition to these districts, the districts of Amravati, Akola, Chandrapur, Dhule, Gondia, Hingoli, Jalgaon, Jalna, Nagpur, Nanded, Parbhani, Washim and Yavatmal have reported less than 1% combined positivity rate. The overall positivity rate in the state is at 3.1% for between August 2 and August 8.The districts of Bhandara, Gondia, Nandurbar and Wardha have reported four, two, four and eight new Covid-19 cases, respectively, between August 2 and August 8. The RTPCR positivity is 0.1% for three of the districts. Wardha reported a 0.5% RTPCR positivity for the same week.Prerna Deshbhratar, district magistrate and collector, Wardha, said, “In April we saw a peak when the fresh case count went up to 1,200 a day. During the peak we appointed a nodal officer for ambulance and oxygen management. We also trained our doctors to ensure that there is a judicious use of Remdesivir. We also insisted on admissions through reference, because we found that many people occupied oxygen beds even though they did not actually need it. So we had a helpline number for the district, wherein people could describe their symptoms and then get a bed. After the peak in May, we imposed a strict lockdown. Even essentials were kept restricted so that the movement of people is under control. Now Wardha has only 11 active cases as of Tuesday.”Back in March and April, Amravati was one of the first districts to report a spike in Covid-19 cases, hinting at the start of the deadly second Covid-19 wave. However, Amravati currently is in a much better situation with less than 54 new Covid-19 cases between August 2 and August 8, which took its combined positivity rate to 0.4%. Dr Dilip Ramnale, district health officer at Amravati said, “During the peak we focused on contact tracing at least 15-20 contacts of every new Covid-19 patient. During the first wave, if someone you know tested positive people would get themselves tested immediately. However, in the second wave, people did not cooperate for contact tracing. They limited it to only their family members and so we tested their neighbours also to ensure every possible contact is traced.”“As of now our focus is on vaccination and we are working to dispel the fear among the tribal population. Initially, there was no cooperation, especially in Melghat. So we vaccinated the sarpanch first and conducted a drive like a festival and vaccinated as many people as possible. We have a target to vaccinate at least 2.2 million beneficiaries and have vaccinated 0.9 million, both first and second dose.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/4-districts-in-maha-report-single-digit-new-covid-10-cases-101628698650333.html
12-08-2021||Pune||Pune airport runway re-carpeting work: No flights after 8 pm may prolong beyond October||Pune: The Pune International Airport at Lohegaon has no flights between 8 pm and 8 am due to the runway repair work scheduled to be completed by October this year. However, the work is expected to extend beyond the October deadline. The airport authorities are carrying out runway re-carpeting work. According to the airport officials, the Indian Air Force (IAF), which controls the runway, has appointed a contractor for re-carpeting of the runway. As the work is carried out only at nights, no flights are scheduled during this time. The authorities stated that the work is expected to continue beyond the deadline due to various reasons, including the Covid situation. “Only the IAF can tell the status of the project. Our effort is to complete it in a time-bound banner, but situations do arise because of the Covid pandemic. I feel that the work will be completed before the scheduled time,” said Pune airport director Santosh Doke. A complete closure of the runway is expected for 15 days in October-November. Earlier, it was planned for April-May, but was postponed for transporting Covishield vaccine consignments, officials said. At least 4,431 passengers arrived and 4,274 passengers departed from Pune airport on 40 flights operated on August 9. The Pune airport is chiefly a defence air base belonging to the IAF and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) utilised it as a civil airport.

It also filed a case against ED officials earlier, which was quashed by the high court in April.Justice PB Suresh Kumar issued the stay order and notices to Vijayan, the state, and central governments.Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the ED, told the court the state government’s decision to order the inquiry against a central agency was against the federal norms and Section 3 of the Commission of Inquiry Act. He added the section says an inquiry can be constituted only for the purpose of a matter of public importance. Mehta said the inquiry was constituted to impede the ongoing investigation into the smuggling case.Kerala’s advocate general, Gopalakrishna Kurup, argued the state has the right to protect its interest and the issue was of public interest. The court later stayed the inquiry and said it will hear the issue in detail later.The smuggling case surfaced in July 2020 when Customs officials at the Thiruvananthapuram airport seized a diplomatic bag addressed to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate after a tip-off that it was being used to smuggle gold. The bag arrived on a chartered flight from the UAE and contained 30 kg of gold.Vijayan’s former principal secretary, M Sivasankar, was among those arrested in the case. Alleged dollar smuggling also came to light during the probe into the case, which separate central agencies are probing. Vijayan has accused the Centre of intimidation by using central agencies.Two accused in the smuggling case, Swapna Suresh and Sandeep Nair, purportedly complained in an audio clip, which was leaked to the media, that they were under pressure to name Vijayan and other government officials.A video clip of Suresh, who is lodged in Thiruvananthapuram’s women’s jail, in which she purportedly said she was under pressure to name ministers and Vijayan was also leaked. Later, two women officers, who escorted Suresh, also claimed that they saw ED officials forcing her to name important personalities, including Vijayan.The ED has denied these claims. The Customs department filed an affidavit in the high court in March quoting Suresh’s statement alleging Vijayan, three of his ministers and the speaker of the Kerala assembly were aware of smuggling activities.The ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI (M) rejected the affidavit and accused the central agencies of trying to discredit the state government. The party announced protest rallies outside Customs offices in several cities in response.CPI(M)’s acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan said the high court’s stay order is not a final verdict. “It is only an interim stay. We will discuss it with legal experts and take necessary action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kerala-high-court-stays-judicial-inquiry-against-ed-101628679990500.html
12-08-2021||World||‘Air rescue’ for 3 Indian engineers who remained at dam site in Taliban-controlled area||The Indian embassy in Kabul on Thursday again advised Indians in Afghanistan to return home in view of the deteriorating security situation, saying three engineers who remained at a project site not controlled by Afghan forces had required an “emergency air rescue”. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the three engineers were at a dam site in a Taliban controlled area. Further details of the emergency air rescue, such as the area and when it was carried out, could not immediately be ascertained. The security advisory from the Indian embassy was the fourth such alert issued since June 29 and reiterated the call for Indian nationals in Afghanistan to make immediate arrangements to return home via commercial air services. It also reiterated a warning to avoid non-essential travel because of a serious threat of kidnapping. The advisory pointed to the case of the three Indian engineers and said those ignoring the embassy’s advisories were putting themselves in “mortal danger”. “A recent case that required emergency air rescue of three Indian engineers who remained at a dam project site, in an area not under the control of government forces, has brought to light that Indian nationals receiving this embassy’s advisories are not heeding its advice and continue to put themselves in mortal danger,” the alert said. The Indian embassy underscored the “need for all Indian nationals to fully adhere to steps” in previous security advisories. It also referred to the killing of photo-journalist Danish Siddiqui by the Taliban in the border town of Spin Boldak on July 16 and said Indian reporters visiting Afghanistan faced additional risks. “Special attention is once again drawn to members of the Indian media arriving in Afghanistan for ground reporting. As a recent tragic incident demonstrated, the public profile of Indian journalists in Afghanistan entails additional risks,” the advisory said. The embassy advised members of the Indian media to take “additional security measures for their stay and movements inside Afghanistan, including tying up of interviews and planned coverage before arrival in Afghanistan”. Indian reporters travelling to Afghanistan should also identify well established security logistic firms who can make arrangements for their stay and movement, it added. Reports emerging after Siddiqui’s death have suggested he was captured and killed by the Taliban. According to information provided by the government in Parliament last week, there were some 1,500 Indian nationals in Afghanistan. Officials said this figure has come down as many Indians have returned in recent days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/air-rescue-for-3-indian-engineers-who-remained-at-dam-site-in-taliban-controlled-area-101628791908655.html

Citing the emergency air rescue operation at a Dam project site, the embassy warned that Indian nationals are not following its security advisories and continue to put themselves in mortal danger."A recent case that required emergency air rescue of three Indian engineers who remained at a dam project site, in an area not under the control of government forces, has brought to light that Indian nationals receiving this embassy's advisories are not heeding its advice and continue to put themselves in mortal danger," the embassy said in a fresh advisory.The Indian embassy in Kabul had issued three separate advisories on June 29, July 24 and August 10 over the evolving situation in Afghanistan as the Taliban continues its offensive against government forces and civilians. It stated that the previous advisories remain valid, requesting all Indian nationals to strictly adhere to the measures advocated."Embassy of India Kabul once again underscores the need for all Indian nationals to fully adhere to steps in the security advisories provided from time to time," the new advisory said.In an apparent reference to the killing of Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Danish Siddiqui in Kandahar, the embassy also highlighted the additional security risks that entail Indian journalists.“It is therefore advised that members of the Indian media should take additional security measures for their stay and movements inside Afghanistan including tying up of interviews and planned coverage before arrival in Afghanistan, as well as identifying well-established security logistic firms who can make necessary security arrangements for stay and movement of the journalists,” the advisory said.On Tuesday, India requested its citizens in and around Mazar-e-Sharif to board a special flight leaving for New Delhi as the Taliban advanced to seize the fourth largest Afghan city. It had also advised all Indian citizens in Afghanistan to make immediate travel arrangements to return home before commercial air services are discontinued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-embassy-in-kabul-says-citizens-not-following-advisories-after-3-engineers-rescued-101628790671388.html
12-08-2021||World||Spain battles wildfires as heatwave kicks in||Firefighters battled three wildfires in Spain on Thursday as a heatwave that has enveloped southeastern Europe in recent days shifted west towards the Iberian peninsula.Dozens of firefighters backed by four water-dropping aircraft were on the scene of a blaze in the northeastern province of Tarragona which has so far destroyed some 40 hectares (100 acres) of protected forest, local officials said.Two smaller fires were burning in the northern wine-producing region of La Rioja and the northeastern province of Zaragoza, which involved two planes.The wildfires come as temperatures were forecast to reach highs of around 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in much of Spain and neighbouring Portugal in the coming days.The mercury could hit the mid-40s in some areas of southern Spain.Scientists say global temperature rises powered by manmade climate change will make heatwaves more frequent and more intense, and their impact more widespread.A heatwave fed by hot air from North Africa has engulfed large parts of the Mediterranean region in recent days, contributing to massive wildfires and killing dozens of people in Italy, Turkey, Greece and Algeria.All but three of Spain's 17 regions were on alert for heat while Portugal's weather office warned that the centre and north of the country as well as parts of the southern Algarve province were on "maximum" alert for wildfires.In 2017, fires killed dozens of people in Portugal.Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa urged people to avoid "risky behaviours" which could cause wildfires."We know that the next few days are going to be difficult," he told reporters on Thursday during a visit to a civil protection headquarters."We are facing a permanent challenge that is the result of climate change," he added.Spain's northeastern Catalonia region on Thursday banned camping in forests and sporting activities in rural areas to reduce the risk of wildfires.It also prohibited the use of some farm equipment during the hottest hours of the day.For the first time since 1920, temperatures are forecast to soar above 40 degrees Celsius for three consecutive days at Madrid's central Retiro park, tweeted Ruben del Campo, the spokesman for Spain's national weather office AEMET.The number of heatwaves registered in Spain between 2011 and 2020 is double the number recorded in each of the three previous decades, he told AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-battles-wildfires-as-heatwave-kicks-in-101628789823539.html

Herat is the country’s third-largest city and is among the recent regions which fell to Taliban forces in the aftermath of the United States pulling out its troops from the war-torn nation.The Taliban released a statement confirming that it captured Herat’s police headquarters, news agencies ANI and Sputnik said. News agency Al Jazeera, too, reported that Taliban terrorists entered Kandahar. Local residents while speaking to Al Jazeera highlighted the plight faced by them and some residents said that Afghanistan's second-largest city was ‘dire’. Intense fighting continued between Taliban and the army inside Kandahar.Taliban on Thursday also captured the 10th provincial city of Ghazni. Despite being part of a peace deal where the United States and the Afghanistan government are also stakeholders, Taliban have unleashed atrocities on the citizens of Afghanistan.The Taliban forces now control two-thirds of the country and a US official report says that capital Kabul could bow down to Taliban pressure within 30 days, leading to the faction gaining full control of the nation within a few months. It currently has taken control of 11 of Afghanistan's 34 provincial capitals.The United Nations said that Taliban terrorists have killed more than 1,000 civilians and wounded 4,042 people. India has also expressed concern regarding the situation in Afghanistan and is ready for all kinds of situations.

In a July 2020 decision, the high court said Mehta needed to redo his legal analysis and weight the House's needs for Trump's financial records against the burden such a request puts on the former president.Mehta's ruling from this week did that, and it was a split decision. He said Trump's accounting firm, Mazars, should turn over financial documents to the House committee but not all of the records the panel had sought.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-appeals-ruling-that-us-house-can-see-financial-records-101628788153463.html

Govt answers||India is closely monitoring all the developments regarding Hindu and Sikh minorities living in Afghanistan, the ministry of external affairs said on Thursday as the situation in the war-torn region continues to deteriorate with the Taliban making rapid gains. Citing the earlier efforts by the government to protect the minorities in Afghanistan, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a weekly press briefing that the Indian embassy in Kabul is in touch with the Hindus and Sikhs residing in Afghanistan.“Last year, our mission in Kabul had facilitated the return of 383 members of the Sikh and Hindu communities in Afghanistan. Our mission continues to remain in touch with the Afghan Hindu and Sikh community members and we will ensure the provision of all necessary assistance to them,” Bagchi said.Last week, the Taliban allegedly removed Nishan Sahib, a Sikh religious flag, from a gurdwara in eastern Afghanistan, but was restored after widespread criticism. Puneet Singh Chandhok, president of the Indian World Forum, said the caretaker of the gurdwara informed him that several Talibs revisited the place and agreed to its “functioning as per customs,” reported news agency ANI.Also Read | Trump slams Biden, calls for ‘conditions-based’ Afghan exitAccording to a US report on international religious freedom in Afghanistan, approximately 200 Sikhs and Hindus fled to either India or Western countries in 2019 because of security threats and a “perceived lack of government protection.” In 2018, about 500-600 members of Hindu and Sikh communities left the country fearing religious persecution.“Their members continued to avoid settling disputes in the courts due to fear of retaliation and instead chose to settle disputes through community councils,” the report says.The gains made by the Taliban has renewed the security concerns for the religious minorities in Afghanistan.

The virtual meeting of officials from India, Australia, Japan and the US also reviewed progress in key areas such as the Quad vaccine partnership, critical and emerging technologies and climate change. During the grouping’s first summit in March, the Quad decided to set up working groups focused on these three areas. Thursday’s meeting was a follow-up to the meeting of foreign ministers on February 18 and the virtual Quad leaders’ summit on March 12. The external affairs ministry said the officials discussed the wide-ranging impact of Covid-19 in the Indo-Pacific and the importance of collaborative efforts to contain the pandemic and ensure health security and a quick economic recovery. The officials explored the possibility of collaboration in resilient supply chains, emerging and critical technologies, maritime security, cyber security, counter-terrorism, infrastructure and connectivity, higher education, climate change and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, the ministry added. Japan’s foreign ministry said in a readout that the officials concurred on advancing practical cooperation on these issues to achieve a free and open Indo-Pacific. The officials also exchanged views on regional issues such as the situation in North Korea, the East and South China Seas and Myanmar. A statement from the US state department said the “four democracies acknowledged that global security and prosperity depends on the region remaining inclusive, resilient, and healthy”. The officials also examined ways to advance cooperation such as strategic challenges confronting the region, countering disinformation, promoting democracy and human rights, strengthening international institutions such as the UN and related bodies, and “supporting countries vulnerable to coercive actions in the Indo-Pacific”, the US statement added. The Quad vaccine partnership was created to manufacture vaccines developed by the US in India with funding from the American and Japanese development banks. These jabs were to be distributed among developing countries across the Indo-Pacific with Australia’s logistics chain. The members of Quad were looking to start the distribution of the vaccines as early as the second quarter of this year, but these plans suffered a setback after India was hit hard by a second wave of Covid-19 infections in March and all vaccine stocks were repurposed for the domestic vaccination programme. The Quad members are now hoping to get the initiative rolling by early 2022, especially to counter China, which has taken the lead in delivering jabs to South and Southeast Asian countries either as donations or commercial supplies. During the meeting, the officials welcomed the fact that a free and open Indo-Pacific as a “vision for the peace and prosperity of the region and its importance in the post-Covid world is increasing”, the readout from Japan’s foreign ministry said. This vision has spread in the world community, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and Europe, and the officials reaffirmed the importance of broadening cooperation with more countries for its further achievement, the readout added. The officials reaffirmed their strong support for Asean’ unity and centrality and the Asean-led regional architecture, as well as full support for Asean’s Indo-Pacific policy. The officials agreed to work towards holding an in-person summit by the end of this year, as well as a foreign minister’s meeting at least once a year. The meeting was joined by Vani Rao, joint secretary (Americas) and Naveen Srivastava, additional secretary (East Asia) from the external affairs ministry, deputy minister for foreign policy Masataka Okano and deputy director general (Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau) Kazuya Endo from Japan’s foreign ministry, Justin Hayhurst, deputy secretary (Indo-Pacific Group) and Lauren Bain, assistant secretary (ASEAN and regional architecture branch) from Australia’s foreign ministry, and Richard Buangan from the bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs and Dean Thompson, acting assistant secretary (South and Central Asian Affairs) from the US state department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-partnerships-climate-change-on-agenda-of-quad-key-officials-meet-101628785847521.html
12-08-2021||World||Pakistani forces clash with Afghan protesters at border crossing shut by Taliban||Pakistani forces clashed on Thursday with hundreds of Afghans stranded on Pakistan's side of a commercially vital border crossing with Afghanistan after its closure by Taliban insurgents, Pakistani security officials said.The disturbances broke out after a 56-year-old Afghan traveller died of a heart attack as he waited in the dusty heat to enter Afghanistan via the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing, Arif Kakar, a Pakistani official on the scene, told Reuters.Protesters carried his body to a local Pakistani government office demanding the border be reopened. Some began throwing stones at security forces, who responded by firing tear gas and charging the protesters with batons to disperse them. No injuries were reported.The Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing is landlocked Afghanistan's second busiest entry point and main commercial artery to the Pakistani seacoast.The Taliban, who captured the crossing last month as part of a major advance across Afghanistan as U.S.-led foreign forces withdraw, announced its closure on Aug. 6 in protest at a Pakistani decision to end visa-free travel for Afghans.The hardline Islamist Taliban are demanding Pakistan allow Afghans to cross the frontier with either an Afghan ID card or a Pakistani-issued refugee registration card.Taliban fighters have rapidly taken territory from the Kabul government in recent weeks, including important border crossings with Iran and Central Asian countries that now provide significant customs revenue for the group.Some 900 trucks went through the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing daily before the Taliban seized it.Opening the border with Pakistan for visa-free travel would not only help the Taliban curry favour from ordinary Afghans but also shore up a route to areas of Pakistan that have housed Taliban fighters and some commanders.Pakistan and the Taliban long maintained good relations though Islamabad says this ended after the 2001 U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan that ousted the radical Islamists from power for having sheltered al Qaeda militants who carried out the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.Western capitals and the Kabul government say Pakistani support to the Taliban continues and many of its leaders enjoy safe haven in the country, something Islamabad denies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-forces-clash-with-afghan-protesters-at-border-crossing-shut-by-taliban-101628782183379.html
12-08-2021||World||Trump slams Biden, calls for ‘conditions-based’ Afghan exit||Former US president Donald Trump on Thursday joined growing criticism of President Joe Biden’s handling of the situation in Afghanistan, saying the withdrawal of US-led international forces should be based on conditions on the ground. He added that what is going on in the country is “not acceptable”. “If I were now President, the world would find that our withdrawal from Afghanistan would be a conditions-based,” Trump said. “I personally had discussions with top Taliban leaders whereby they understood what they are doing now would not have been acceptable,” Trump added, referring to negotiations that led to the signing of the accord with the Taliban in February 2020.President Biden, it must be noted, is implementing that same deal although he has publicly expressed reservations with it, saying it’s not something he would have negotiated. He only changed the exit date, from May end to August end, to be wrapped up by September 11, the 20th anniversary of 9/11 terrorist attacks that brought the US to Afghanistan.“It would have been a much different and much more successful withdrawal, and the Taliban understood that better than anyone,” Trump said further in a statement. “What is going on now is not acceptable. It should have been done much better.”President Biden has come under growing criticism at home and abroad for the summary withdrawal of US-led international troops that have continued at a rapid pace despite military advances made by the Taliban, who are now in control of ten provincial capitals, raising fears of the return of the barbaric regime that they led from 1996 to 2001, when they were overthrown by the US-led forces and Afghanistan militias.US officials estimate Kabul to fall to the Taliban in a month or two, according to news reports. And the Biden administration appears to have been surprised by the speed of the Taliban’s progress.Biden has defended his decision and ruled out any changes in the pullout plan. “Afghan leaders have to come together,” he said on Tuesday. “They’ve got to fight for themselves, fight for their nation.”He added: “I do not regret my decision.”The Taliban’s military advances have caused international concern and the UN Security Council (UNSC) has condemned the violence and reaffirmed its opposition to the restoration of the Islamic emirate.India, which has the rotational presidency of the UNSC for August, told the body at a briefing on Afghanistan last Friday that “(it’s) time for the international community and, in particular, this council to take stock of the situation, and decide on actions that would help bring a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire and ensure an immediate cessation of violence”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-slams-biden-calls-for-conditions-based-afghan-exit-101628781946913.html
12-08-2021||World||US conducts impact trial test on nuclear carrier, sends message to China: Report||The US Navy’s aircraft carrier Gerald R Ford successfully withstood an impact trial test when 20 tonnes of explosives were detonated underwater, news agency PTI reported citing American Navy officials. Military observers told the news agency that the successful test indicates that the threat posed by Chinese ‘carrier killer’ missiles have been effectively reduced.The final trial was conducted in Florida on Sunday. Earlier full ship shock trials were conducted on the US’ most advanced nuclear carrier on June 18 and July 16. During the shock trial testing 40,000 pounds of ordnance is detonated in the water near the hull to test the ship as well as its system. Success in the test will indicate no major injuries, no fires and no flooding. The amount of ordnance used is equivalent to a 3.9-magnitude earthquake.“We had zero catastrophic failures on the ship, zero situations where we had flooding or anything, and zero fires. All that is pretty significant,” Capt. Paul Lanzilotta, Ford’s commanding officer was quoted as saying in the press release.China watched the developments very keenly as the Chinese military continues to flaunt its DF-21D and DF-26 missiles, which it calls ‘carrier killers’. China’s carrier killers can hit moving aircraft carriers from a distance of 5,000 kilometres.Former Chinese military instructor Song Zhongping told the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post that the 40,000lbs explosive blast was bigger ‘than any single warhead of a conventional missile or torpedo’. He also said that the reason for conducting the trial is also to send a message to China and Russia that US aircraft carriers have ‘super-resilience’. “They want to send a message to China and Russia… They are not worried about Chinese or Russian conventional anti-ship weapons,” Zhongping was quoted as saying by the SCMP.Zhongping however said that some ballistic and hypersonic missiles have the capability of taking these carriers fully out of combat as they may also carry electromagnetic pulse weapons that are detonated at high altitude.China’s DF-26, according to military experts, can conduct accurate nuclear or conventional strikes against ground and naval targets.US plans to maintain a stronger fleetIn July, the Chinese president Xi Jinping asked the People’s Liberation Army to ‘ make resolute efforts to transform China’s army into the world’s best army by 2027 on par with the US army’. The Chinese navy continues to strengthen its fleet and has more ships than the US. Chinese navy has 360 ships and the US Navy 297, as of 2020. The US, however, has larger ships with 11 aircraft carriers to China’s two. The US also has 92 cruisers and destroyers compared to PLA’s 33, according to a report by news agency SCMP. The US government in June made it clear that it plans to maintain a fleet of between 321 and 372 manned ships.The US Navy’s moves come amid the US trying to challenge the Chinese supremacy in the disputed South China Sea. The test sends a message that its focus on maintaining its supremacy is its primary objective as China’s navy continues its shipbuilding spree.China’s anti-ship ballistic missiles DF-21D and DF-26, also known as the ‘aircraft carrier killer’ missiles, simultaneously hit targets which were moving thousands of kilometres in a test in the South China Sea in 2020, according to the SCMP. Russia is also testing Zircon -- a hypersonic anti-ship cruise missile - which has the ability to reach a maximum speed of Mach 9.(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-conducts-impact-trial-test-on-nuclear-carrier-sends-message-to-china-report-101628781378225.html

Appearing for NBC’s ‘Today’ show, Fauci revealed that booster shots will be recommended “imminently” for fully vaccinated people with weakened immune systems.While the 80-year-old immunologist said the United States is not going to administer booster shots in coming days to people other than those who are immuno-compromised, he acknowledged that “inevitably there will be a time when we'll have to get boosts” since “no vaccine, at least not within this category, is going to have an indefinite amount of protection.”Fauci, the chief medical advisor to US President Joe Biden, said researchers are collecting data to determine when the protection for other vaccinated groups, like the elderly, will go below a “critical level”.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will have to amend emergency use authorisation for Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to approve booster shots for immuno-compromised people.Also Read | Anthony Fauci says Covid boosters should go ‘soon’ to the vulnerableEarlier this month, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for a moratorium on booster shots until at least the end of September to enable all countries to vaccinate at least 10% of their population.

But we cannot accept countries that have already used most of the global supply of vaccines using even more of it, while the Earth globe Europe-Africa's most vulnerable people remain unprotected," the WHO chief said.However, the call has largely gone unheeded with most of the high-income countries as they have moved ahead with their booster shots plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-vaccine-to-provide-protection-indefinitely-everyone-will-need-booster-shots-fauci-101628778851188.html

12-08-2021||World||Covid-19: Ningbo-Zhoushan, world's third-busiest port partly shut down by China||China partly shut the world’s third-busiest container port after a worker became infected with Covid, threatening more damage to already fragile supply chains and global trade as a key shopping season nears.All inbound and outbound container services at Meishan terminal in Ningbo-Zhoushan port were halted Wednesday until further notice due to a “system disruption,” according to a statement from the port. An employee tested positive for coronavirus, the eastern Chinese city’s government said.The closed terminal accounts for about 25% of container cargo through the port, calculates security consultant GardaWorld, which said “the suspension could severely impact cargo handling and shipping.” Germany’s Hapag-Lloyd AG said there will be a delay in sailings.This is the second recent shutdown of a Chinese port due to the coronavirus, after the closure of Yantian port in Shenzhen from late May for about a month. That shutdown caused goods to back up in factories and storage yards and also likely contributed to soaring freight rates, which are at record levels. The fear is that this new disruption will further strain international shipping and supplies of goods, already hurt by the pandemic’s squeeze on manufacturers. An extended shuttering at Ningbo could be especially damaging for the world economy because seaborne trade usually rises toward the end of the year as companies ship Christmas and holiday products.“There may be far-reaching downstream consequences going into Black Friday and holiday shopping seasons” and the next 24 hours will determine whether there is a large outbreak or not, said Josh Brazil, vice president of marketing at project44, a supply-chain intelligence firm. “One of the few givens in 2021 is endemic delays, and the fact that conditions can change almost overnight.”In addition to the closed terminal, containers for shipment through the other terminals in the port will likely slow. The port will now only accept containers within two days of a ship’s estimated arrival time, according to a statement from shipping and logistics firm CMA CGM SA.The biggest exports through Ningbo in the first half of this year were electronic goods, textiles and low and high-end manufactured goods, according to the city’s Customs Bureau. Top imports included crude oil, electronics, raw chemicals and agricultural products. Speaking about the outbreak, Hugo De Stoop, CEO of oil shipper Euronav NV said “there will be an impact on China’s oil demand, but the length of the impact is unclear.” For port outbreaks “the Chinese authorities are very very strict. When they find a case they will be very quick to shutdown, isolate the workers, isolate the coworkers who have had contact with that specific worker and then reopen as quickly as possible,” he told Bloomberg Television Thursday, adding that this strictness in dealing with outbreaks can disrupt markets. All the close contacts of the infected worker have been identified and are in quarantine, according to Ningbo City’s statement. A port spokesman who declined to give his name said there was no new information when contacted Thursday.The port was the third busiest globally in terms of container shipments in 2020 and the second busiest in China after Shanghai, according to maritime publication Lloyd’s List.The discovery of the port worker that tested positive for Covid-19 shows that virus-prevention measures in Ningbo City still has loopholes, the local government said in a statement on its website Thursday, which urged officials to implement quarantines, disinfection and close affected areas to prevent the virus’ spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-ningbo-zhoushan-world-s-third-busiest-port-partly-shut-down-by-china-101628771431112.html

The protesters will call on Pakistan, which has long been accused of covertly assisting the Islamist fundamentalist group, to stop the “proxy war” in Afghanistan. The protest will be held from 1-3pm on August 14.“#Stop Proxy War in Afghanistan,” reads a poster calling on people to demonstrate against Pakistan’s alleged involvement in a surge in violence in the war-torn country.Similar demonstrations were held across the globe last month where protesters highlighted the activities of terror outfits in Pakistan. In Germany, the Afghan diaspora gathered in front of Brandenburg Gate to protest against “Pakistan’s intervention in affairs of Afghanistan.”Meanwhile, many on social media have started a massive campaign against Pakistan’s alleged meddling in Afghanistan’s internal affairs. ‘#SanctionPakistan’ was a top trend on all social media platforms in Afghanistan for three days in a row, according to a prominent Afghan journalist Habib Khan who called on the international community to listen to the request of civilians.Also Read | Afghan govt offers Taliban power-sharing deal in Qatar to end violence: ReportSocial media hashtags including "SanctionPakistan", "Stop Proxy War", and "Stop Supporting" terrorist groups were trending in Afghanistan as the Taliban has intensified its offensive against security forces as well as the civilian population. Pakistan has repeatedly denied the claims, calling it a malicious campaign to malign its image."Attempts are underway to blame Pakistan for Afghanistan's failures. As the Taliban offensive is increasing, there are campaigns to shift its blame on Pakistan," Pakistan National Security Adviser Moeed Yusuf told a press conference on Wednesday.Thousands of civilians have been displaced due to the Taliban’s offensive and many of them have taken refuge in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital city. According to a UN estimate, more than 3 lakh Afghans have been displaced internally while around 40,000 people have been fleeing to neighbouring Iran every week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stop-proxy-war-afghan-diaspora-to-protest-in-front-of-pak-embassy-in-us-101628771298996.html

The Taliban has been reluctant to strike a political settlement with the Afghan government and other regional stakeholders since the US-led troops finalised their withdrawal from the region."Yes, the government has submitted a proposal to Qatar as mediator. The proposal allows the Taliban to share power in return for a halt in violence in the country," AFP quoted a government negotiator as saying.The Taliban fighters have intensified their offensive against Afghan security forces as they make rapid gains in the region. The Islamist fundamentalist group has taken control of 10 provincial capital so far and the US has reportedly expressed concerns that Kabul may fall to militants within three months.The deteriorating situation has prompted India to advise its nationals in Afghanistan to make immediate arrangements to leave the country. A special flight was flown from Mazar-e-Sharif to New Delhi carrying India-based officials and security personnel from the Indian consulate and a small number of Indian nationals living in and around Afghanistan’s fourth-largest city."We're closely monitoring developments, we're concerned about deteriorating security situation.

12-08-2021||World||China to bring in sweeping new laws on governance||The Chinese government has said it will make new laws on national security, monopolies, education, and culture, signalling that an ongoing crackdown on various industrial sectors will continue.The ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council, or China’s Cabinet, publicised the plans late on Wednesday as part of a five-year plan for “building a law-based government”.President Xi Jinping, perceived as China’s most powerful ruler since Mao Zedong, has made “rule of law” one of his several signature aspects of his governance style, which will be extended if - as expected - he seeks a third term next year.The CPC and the government said in a blueprint for the five years to 2025 that they would also improve legislation around public health by amending the infectious disease law and the “frontier health and quarantine law”.It is rare for the CPC and the government - though the latter is an extension of the former - to jointly issue a document, published by the Xinhua news agency.“It (the new document) urges improving government functions in various fields, including economic adjustment, market supervision, social management, public service, and environmental protection,” Xinhua reported on the 10-point plan.In the document, China’s top leadership urged “…governments at all levels to promote law-based administration with the help of digital technologies, including the internet, big data, and artificial intelligence”.On improving the law-based business environment, the plan calls for concrete efforts to prevent the administrative power from eliminating or stifling competition.“It also promises strengthened enforcement of anti-monopoly and anti-unfair competition laws.”“It stresses pushing forward legislative activities and studies in key areas such as national security, bio-security, infectious diseases prevention and control, and digital economy.”The unveiling of the document seems to be part of Beijing’s ongoing crackdown on technology companies and the private education systemEarlier this year, Beijing launched anti-monopoly investigations into some of the country’s biggest technology firms; tech giant Alibaba accepted a record $2.8 billion fine after an investigation found that it had abused its dominant market position for years.In July, another tech behemoth Tencent had to end exclusive music licensing deals with record labels around the world - also charged with monopolistic practices.The government has sharpened scrutiny of after-school tuition services offered by individual teachers, raiding such places.A Reuters report said that shares in many Chinese companies listed in the US, Hong Kong and mainland China have fallen sharply this year as investors’ concerns grow over the crackdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-bring-in-sweeping-new-laws-on-governance-101628766154264.html

12-08-2021||World||Britain's economy saw faster growth in June as lockdown rules eased: Data||The United Kingdom's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an entire percentage point, which is 0.8 per cent more than what was predicted by economists, in June when the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-necessitated lockdown was eased. The information was provided on Thursday by Britain's office for national statistics noting that the economic growth for the country is now at 4.8 per cent for the second quarter, which is close to the 5 per cent prediction made by the Bank of England last week.The latest statistics imply that the UK economy is only 2.2 per cent smaller than before the series of Covid-19 lockdowns and related regulations came into effect. This, in turn, implies a sharp recovery from the worst recession that the country faced in three centuries. The Bank of England expects the lost output to return by the end of this year.“Today’s figures show that our economy is on the mend, showing strong signs of recovery,” news agency Bloomberg quoted the chancellor of the exchequer Rishi Sunak as saying. “I know there are still challenges to overcome, but I feel confident in the strength of the UK economy.”What's behind UK's economic growth in June?According to statisticians quoted by the news agency, UK's health services and a resurgence in hospitality were the key driving factors behind the economic growth in June. Along with these sectors, education also surged during the quarter when schools reopened after the lockdowns rules were used.Since UK residents made frequent visits to general physicians, the health and social work sector became the largest contributor to the June growth, said Hande Kucuk, the deputy director of the National Institute of Economic & Social Research. “We expect growth to slow in the third quarter but still remain high by historical standards,” he said.Another reason behind the strong economic recovery is the massive financial support provided by the government, for example by paying the bulk of private-sector wages.Economic rebound faces challengeHowever, total UK output remains 4.4 per cent lower compared with before the Covid-19 pandemic, or the final quarter of 2019. The GDP fell by 1.6 per cent in the first three months of the year, the office for national statistics noted, indicating that the economic rebound has plenty of challenges up ahead.The jobs protection programme sponsored by the government is set to end this September, while global supply chain bottlenecks still persist. Analysts also warn that strong price rises could force central banks to hike interest rates sooner than expected, hindering the recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britains-economy-saw-faster-growth-in-june-as-lockdown-rules-eased-data-101628755515777.html
12-08-2021||World||Afghanistan replaces army chief as Taliban continues to advance||The Afghan army chief has been replaced amid Taliban offensive, reports said, as the Taliban continued to make rapid advances across Afghanistan capturing key cities. General Wali Mohammad Ahmadzai was on Wednesday replaced by Hibatullah Alizai, the commander of the Special Operations Corps, multiple reports including from local media said on Wednesday. "General Hibatullah Alizai, the commander of the Special Operations Corps, was appointed as the chief of army staff, replacing General Wali Ahmadzai, officials confirmed," a tweet by TOLO News read.As of Thursday morning, the Taliban insurgents have taken control of 10 provincial capitals in the northern region as the US is withdrawing its army troops from the country. Ghazni, which is just 150 kilometres away from the country's capital of Kabul, became the latest city to be captured by the Taliban.The sacking of the army chief followed a visit by the country's President Ashraf Ghani in Mazar-e-Sharif in the Balkh province, which fall into Taliban control on Wednesday.Since May, when the US and Nato forces started withdrawing from the country, the Taliban began an assault on major cities and seized control of cities Sar-e-Pol, Sheberghan, Aybak, Kunduz, Taluqan, Pul-e-Khumri, Farah, Zaranj and Faizabad.As the conflict continues to spiral, the Taliban have also been attacking civilians. UN high commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet on Tuesday said at least 180 people have been killed while more than 1,180 have been wounded in four Afghan cities alone since July 9. Many members of Afghan security forces have also been killed and wounded in the violence.With the Afghan air power limited and in disarray, the US air force is believed to be carrying out some series of strikes to support Afghan forces. Aviation tracking data suggested US Air Force B-52 bombers, F-15 fighter jets, drones and other aircraft were involved in the fighting overnight across the country, news agency AP reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-replaces-army-chief-as-taliban-continues-to-advance-101628756665815.html

This makes Ghazni the tenth provincial capital to fall to the Taliban this week, amid a rapidly deteriorating political situation which reportedly has the United States worried that Kabul may fall to the insurgents in 90 days."The Taliban took control of the key areas of the city -- the governor's office, the police headquarters, and the prison," AFP quoted Nasir Ahmad Faqiri, head of the provincial council of Ghazni, as saying. Although clashes are being reported from parts of the city, the provincial capital lies largely under the control of the insurgents at this point, he said.The news agency also reached out to the Taliban to verify the development. A statement posted by the insurgency's spokesperson on social media confirmed the fact that Ghazni has indeed fallen to the Taliban.Ghazni is situated along the major Kabul-Kandahar highway, essentially serving as an important gateway in Afghanistan between the capital city of Kabul and other Taliban strongholds in the south.It is likely that the fall of Ghazni will put more pressure on the Afghan airforce, which is already having a hard time dealing with the Taliban as the insurgents continue seizing provincial capitals around the country. In less than a week, as many as 10 such cities have fallen, with the Taliban strategically encircling the biggest city in the north, the traditional anti-Taliban bastion of Mazar-i-Sharif.According to Reuters, a US defence official cited the country's intelligence sources late on Wednesday and estimated that the Taliban could isolate Kabul in about a month. Considering their recent rapid gains, the militants could also seize control of the Afghan capital within 90 days, the official was quoted as saying by the news agency.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-seizes-key-afghan-city-of-ghazni-us-worried-kabul-could-fall-in-90-days-101628748334077.html

Sami Sadat, the 36-year-old commander of the country's special forces, has been fighting the Taliban and keeping it out in Lashkar Gah, the capital of the southern province of Helmand.The Afghan government on Wednesday promoted Sadat as the commanding general of the Afghan National Army commandos. He was leading the 215 Maiwand Afghan Army Corps before this. Sadat has been tweeting photos and videos of the army's offensive and the atrocities committed by the Taliban even as hundreds of soldiers have reportedly surrendered across Afghanistan.Sadat has 12,400 followers on Twitter and they include government officials to journalists. He told AFP in a phone interview from Lashkar Gah that they are going to win the war despite the Taliban's brutal advances.'Anything but naive'"I know this is our country, that the Taliban are failing, that they will fail sooner or later," he told AFP.

The document may be released this fall.A release from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada said the government “recognises” that proof of vaccination credentials will support the “re-opening of societies and economies” and that Canadians were looking for a “more reliable and secure way to demonstrate their Covid-19 vaccination history to foreign and Canadian border officials”.In that context, it noted that Ottawa is “collaborating with the provinces and territories to develop a proof of vaccination that will facilitate cross-border travel, while reducing the risk of spread and importation of Covid-19.”It also said the attempt was to take “a secure pan-Canadian approach” based on advice from the country’s public health officials.With the country gradually and cautiously reopening, Canada’s minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship Marco Mendicino said “many Canadians are contemplating doing something they haven’t done in over a year and a half: travelling. Our work with the provinces and territories to provide a consistent proof of vaccination is a key step forward in ensuring Canadians will have the documents they need once it is safe to travel again”.While the focus is on a digital proof of vaccination, the passports will also accessible to those unable to avail of them in that form. The passports, the release said, will provide foreign border officials with the traveller’s vaccination history while also providing a “trusted and verifiable credential for when they return home”.Canada is participating in an international dialogue on such passports, including with the World Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization, and through the G7. The statement said while currently there is “no international consensus on an acceptable proof of vaccination”, Ottawa was “working with international partners to recognise proof of vaccination credentials issued in Canada.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-to-issue-vaccine-passports-for-international-travel-101628745813474.html

At least 17,000 of them have taken refuge in national capital Kabul, which is also being threatened by the Sunni Pashtun fighters.The stunning speed at which the Taliban are capturing large swathes of land in Afghanistan raises questions of how long the Afghan government can maintain control of the parts the country it has left.Watch: Taliban seize Mi-35 attack helicopter gifted by India from KunduzThe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) warned on Tuesday that the failure to stem the rising violence and human rights violations and abuses is having disastrous consequences for the people of Afghanistan.Various local news reports say that killings of women and children have risen almost 50 per cent since the Taliban intensified their fight to capture Afghanistan in the wake of withdrawal of US and Nato forces. The reports said that at least 468 children have been killed this year.One of the most criticised moves by the Taliban is a decree saying their fighters can take girls as young as 13 or 14, if they have been widowed in fight with the security forces. Afghan human rights watchdog Women's United Voice Advisory Group on Peace Policy said that the Taliban's actions in relation to "jihad marriage" should be documented worldwide.Meanwhile, fighting is raging in Lashkar Gah, one of Afghanistan's largest cities in the Taliban heartland of Helmand province.

Crews had contained only 30 percent of the blaze as of Wednesday evening.Temperatures were expected to cross over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius) in coming days as a high pressure weather system, described by forecasters as a "heat dome" bakes the Pacific Northwest."High pressure continues to build over the incident and will be the dominant feature with predicted thunderstorms moving in this week," the California Department of Forestry and Fire protection said in an incident update.The thunderstorms can rake the landscape with so-called dry lightning, igniting more flames across Northern California in forests and brush left brown and parched from years of drought.The Dixie Fire has scorched more than 500,000 acres, making it by far the largest and most destructive of 11 wildfires burning across California, fought by nearly 10,000 personnel. Two firefighters and a civilian have been injured.The blaze has now destroyed more than 1,000 single-family homes, along with hundreds of other structures. Flames roared through the historic mining town of Greenville last week, leaving its main street in smoldering ruins.California, which typically experiences peak fire season later in the year, is on pace to suffer more burnt acres this year than last, the worst fire season on record.The state's five largest wildfires in history have all occurred in the last three years, burning more than 2.5 million acres and destroying 3,700 structures.The Dixie Fire is second in size only to last year's August Complex, which was comprised of several smaller fires that merged together to make one massive conflagration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-wildfire-wreaks-more-destruction-as-temperatures-rise-101628737615957.html

Thursday, local health authorities said in an emailed statement. The national capital’s case was the first recorded there outside of the hotel-quarantine system in more than a year; it is currently unknown how the person was infected.“This is by far the most serious public health risk the ACT has faced in the past 12 months,” the territory’s Chief Minister Andrew Barr said in the statement. “We have seen that a short and immediate lockdown limits the potential spread of the virus, and is the best path to avoiding longer and more damaging lockdowns.”It will be Canberra’s first lockdown for more than a year, since the first wave of the pandemic. The inland city of about 500,000 people is some 170 miles from Sydney, which has been in lockdown for almost seven weeks; Melbourne is also currently enforcing stay-at-home orders.New South Wales, Australia’s biggest state economy, recorded 345 new cases Thursday, the vast bulk in Sydney. Daily case numbers have generally been on a steady incline since the outbreak started in Australia’s largest city in mid-June.Two more people in Sydney have died. Both were men in their 90s and had received at least one vaccine dose.Three more local government areas of Sydney will face tighter social-distancing and movement restrictions, while the lockdown in the Hunter Valley region of the state -- including the city of Newcastle -- will be extended for at least another week, New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters on Thursday.With the nation’s capital and two largest cities in lockdown, as well as an increasing number of regional areas, the delta variant of the coronavirus is placing increased pressure on Australia’s so-called “Covid Zero” strategy, which has relied on closed international borders and rigorous testing to eliminate community transmission of the virus.Prime Minister Scott Morrison is aiming to ramp up a tardy vaccine rollout in a bid to start reopening international borders next year, that have only been tightened over the course of the past year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sydney-delta-cases-rise-as-australian-capital-canberra-faces-lockdown-101628736159273.html
12-08-2021||World||Delta-free haven New Zealand sets out path to opening borders||New Zealand laid out a plan for easing some of the world’s toughest border curbs, which have kept out the highly contagious delta variant and seen the island nation effectively Covid-free for much of the pandemic.The government will speed up its vaccine rollout this year and begin a phased reopening of the border in early 2022, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Thursday in Wellington. Vaccinated travelers from low-risk countries will eventually be able to enter New Zealand without going into quarantine, she said.“Getting vaccinated is the number one thing everyone can do to be protected against Covid-19, help accelerate our economic recovery, reduce the risk of lockdowns, and safely allow New Zealand’s borders to begin re-opening next year,” Ardern said. “The first step in our plan is speeding up the vaccination process to ensure everyone is at least partially vaccinated as soon as possible to reduce the risk and impact of delta entering the country.”Since the outset of the pandemic over a year ago, New Zealand’s border has been closed to foreigners and all returning residents have been required to enter a managed isolation facility for two weeks. The system has caught imported cases, but there have been no delta infections in the community so far. A quarantine-free travel bubble with neighbor Australia was suspended last month due to delta-driven outbreaks there.New Zealand’s push to eliminate the virus has paid dividends, with just 26 Covid deaths and life within its borders relatively normal. The country has scored consistently well on Bloomberg’s Covid Resilience Ranking, which measures the best and worst places to be amid the pandemic. After some early lockdowns, community transmission has been scarce thanks to the nation’s isolation and the zero-tolerance border and testing regime.But a slow vaccination rollout -- just 23% of the population is covered, versus more than 50% in the U.S. -- has left it vulnerable to an outbreak of the delta strain, which has forced large parts of Australia back into lockdown. At the same time, Ardern has been under pressure to present a road map out of “fortress New Zealand,” with the restrictions decimating its tourism industry and leading to shortages of migrant labor.Vaccination RolloutArdern said the government will make the Pfizer Inc. vaccine available to all adults sooner than previously planned and increase the gap between doses to six weeks from three. This will allow more New Zealanders to get their first dose sooner and ensure as many as possible are at least partially vaccinated in coming months, she said.From Sept. 1, all eligible ages will be able to book a vaccination appointment.The government will also use the second half of 2021 to conduct a self-isolation trial for vaccinated New Zealanders in preparation for the gradual resumption of quarantine-free travel. From the first quarter of 2022, new risk-based border settings will be introduced that establish low, medium and high-risk pathways into the country.The pathway a traveler takes will be based on the risk associated with where they are coming from and their vaccination status, and each pathway will have testing and isolation requirements proportionate to that risk.A low-risk pathway will permit quarantine-free entry for vaccinated travelers; a medium-risk pathway would include a combination of self-isolation and/or reduced managed isolation for vaccinated travelers, while a high-risk pathway will require a full 14 days in quarantine and testing regardless of vaccination status.“This individual risk-based approach requires new systems to be set up,” Ardern said. “We will use the remainder of 2021 to continue to prepare for the operation of borders under this system.”The government is investigating methods to rapidly test airport arrivals for Covid, she said.Covid ZeroNew Zealand joins other so-called Covid Zero economies -- places that have targeted suppression of the virus within their borders -- in laying out a framework for exiting the strategy. While effective in eliminating the virus, the approach relies on continued isolation, which nations with significant tourism sectors like New Zealand can’t afford long term.‘Covid Zero’ Havens Find Reopening Harder Than Taming VirusSingapore, which has also gone spells Covid-free and tightly polices its borders, says it will start to ease curbs once it hits 80% of the population vaccinated, while Australia has indicated a rough timetable to open up in the first quarter of 2022, a plan that may be complicated by the current resurgence.Meanwhile, China, the biggest adherent of Covid Zero, is doubling down on the strategy after delta got past its defenses and seeds flareups there. The country is not expected to start opening up until mid-to-late next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deltafree-haven-new-zealand-sets-out-path-to-opening-borders-101628735011401.html
12-08-2021||World||US Prez Joe Biden says pull-out is on despite Taliban’s march||US President Joe Biden has ruled out any change in the American plan to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan despite the Taliban group increasingly gaining control over large parts of the war-torn country, saying Afghan leaders need to fight for themselves and their nation.Biden in April ordered the withdrawal of all the US troops from Afghanistan by September 11 to end America’s longest war. The Pentagon’s task of removing service members and equipment out of the country is nearly complete and the US military mission is slated to end by August 31.“No,” Biden told reporters on Tuesday at the White House when asked if his plan to withdraw troops could change at all, given Taliban’s lightning offensive in the north.“Look, we spent over a trillion dollars over 20 years. We trained and equipped over 300,000 Afghan forces. Afghan leaders have to come together. We lost thousands - lost to death and injury - thousands of American personnel. They’ve got to fight for themselves, fight for their nation,” he said.“I’ll insist we continue to keep the commitments we made of providing close air support, making sure that their air force functions and is operable, resupplying their forces with food and equipment, and paying all their salaries. But they’ve got to want to fight,” Biden said.Earlier on Wednesday, the Taliban captured the city of Faizabad in northern Afghanistan, a local MP told AFP, making it the ninth provincial capital to fall to the rampaging insurgents in less than a week.Afghanistan’s President Ashraf Ghani flew to the besieged northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif on Wednesday to rally the beleaguered government forces. But while Ghani is focusing on motivating his troops in Mazar-i-Sharif, US intelligence said the Taliban could isolate the capital city of Kabul in 30 days and potentially take it over in 90 days.Army chief replacedGhani has ordered Hibatullah Alizai to replace Wali Ahmadzai as the Afghan army chief of staff, according to an Afghan official who spoke to AP. Alizai was the commander of the Afghan army’s Special Operations Corps - the elite troops that, along with the air force, have been forced to do most of the fighting as regular forces have collapsed.Finance minister quitsAfghanistan’s acting finance minister Khalid Payenda has resigned and left the country for the US after the Taliban captured key customs posts bleeding the administration of revenue. Payenda has “resigned and left the country because Afghanistan is grappling with declining revenues”, finance ministry spokesman Mohammad Rafi Tabe said.Taliban seize helicopter gifted by India: ReportA video on social media suggests that a helicopter was seized by the Taliban at the Kunduz airbase, according to an ANI report. The chopper that was reportedly seized from Afghan forces may possibly have been one that was gifted by India to Afghanistan a few years ago as part of the capability building of the war-torn country. There was no confirmation of the development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-joe-biden-says-pull-out-is-on-despite-taliban-s-march-101628731959918.html

I am guilty.”He further said the message of compassion, love and justice is universal and 1.3 billion Indians will not be silenced. “They can lock us out on a platform. But they can’t lock out our voice for the sake of the people.”Earlier in the day, the Congress alleged its official Twitter handle as well as that of a large number of party leaders, including Gandhi, and workers have been blocked by the microblogging website. Twitter defended the move saying the accounts were blocked to protect individual privacy and safety after they posted images that violated its rules.The grand old party also moved to Instagram and wrote, "Twitter India has locked the official handle of the principal opposition party. This is an unprecedented attack on the voice of the people."The Congress leadership accused Twitter’s management of acting under pressure from the Narendra Modi government. The party’s chief spokesperson, Randeep Surjewala, said the Centre would not be able to suppress their voice by threatening Twitter. "How much will you scare Twitter at the behest of the police? This is not just an issue of freedom of speech, but it is the issue of raising the voice of a poor Valmiki Dalit girl for justice and bringing it before the country. Till justice is given to the poor girl, we will continue to raise this voice," he said.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi said Twitter was colluding with the government to stifle democracy. "Is Twitter following its own policy for the suspension of Congress leaders' accounts or the Modi government's? Why hadn't it locked the account of SC commission that had tweeted similar photos before any of our leaders did?She further said the real issue was the "brutal rape and forced cremation" of the Dalit girl in the heart of the national capital and questioned the prime minister's silence on it."The real issue is the Delhi Police disallowing the lodging of an FIR for 15 hours. @narendramodi why have you not uttered a single word about this heinous crime against an innocent child?The head of the Congress's social media department, Rohan Gupta, said the party's official Twitter handle and around 5,000 accounts of its top leaders and workers have been blocked by the website."Twitter is clearly acting under the government's pressure as it did not remove the same pictures shared by the Twitter account of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes for a few days," he said.The Twitter accounts of All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretaries Surjewala, K C Venugopal, Harish Rawat, Ajay Maken, the party's whip in the Lok Sabha Manickam Tagore, Assam in-charge and former Union minister Jitendra Singh and Mahila Congress president Sushmita Dev have also been blocked, the party said.Rawat said at a time when the country is just three days away from celebrating Independence Day, the freedom of expression of opposition leaders is being snatched away."Have Twitter India and the Constitution of India become so weak in a democracy?" the former Uttarakhand chief minister asked on Facebook.Congress leader Sachin Pilot accused the Centre of suppressing the voice of opposition leaders."The central government is betraying the countrymen by suppressing the voice of the opposition on issues related to the country," he said in a tweet.When contacted, a Twitter spokesperson said the company's rules are enforced judiciously and impartially for everyone in its service."We have taken proactive action on several hundred tweets that posted an image that violated our rules and may continue to do so in line with our range of enforcement options. Certain types of private information carry higher risks than others and our aim is always to protect individual privacy and safety," he said.Twitter’s move came days after the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) complained to it about Gandhi revealing the identity of the alleged sexual assault victim and her parents. The rights body had directed Twitter to act against Gandhi’s account for violating the privacy of a minor victim, mandated by the laws of the land.Congress leaders changed their Twitter handle names to Rahul Gandhi with some of them even replacing their display pictures on the website with that of the former party chief.Meanwhile, the TMC condemned the action taken by Twitter against Congress leaders."What's going on? We strongly condemn the blocking of the accounts of @INCIndia and senior leaders of the Congress party," Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Derek O'Brien said in a tweet.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-am-guilty-if-rahul-gandhi-takes-to-instagram-as-twitter-blocks-his-account-101628788692461.html

12-08-2021||India||July retail inflation eases to 5.5% to stay within RBI’s limits||Retail inflation, a measure of what households pay for everyday items, slowed in July to 5.59%, staying within the Reserve Bank’s desirable limit for the first time in two months. Some items, such as pulses, clothing, footwear and health costs, however remained high, data released by the government on Thursday showed. The easing of prices, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, comes as a relief not just for consumers, who are battling income and wage losses due to the pandemic, but also the central bank, which decides key economic policies based on how inflation moves. The RBI’s tolerable range for inflation is 4(+/-2)%. A very low inflation reading, which suggests insufficient demand, is not good for the economy either. The retail inflation reading is a key determinant of monetary policy, which refers to the central bank’s decision to raise or reduce interest rates. Higher inflation limits the RBI’s room to keep interests low, needed to boost growth. Thursday’s consumer inflation data showed inflation in the food and beverages category climbed 4.46%, slower than a 5.58% rise in June, led by easing prices of vegetables. Economists often use the term stagflation, a worrying situation, to describe persistently higher inflation and flat growth. They are unsure of whether the lower pace of inflation in July will hold. “It’s increasingly difficult to characterise the (inflationary) pressures as purely transitory in nature,” wrote Aditi Nayar, chief economist of the ratings firm ICRA, in a note.However, commonly consumed protein items such as pulses remained high in July at 9.04%, although they were cheaper when compared to a 10.01% rise in June. The price rise in fuel came in at 12.38%, while clothing and footwear inflation rose 6.4% compared to 6.2% a month ago. Inflation readings compare prices on a year-on-year basis, meaning they track how prices have moved from a year ago. “A sharp fall in food inflation to 3.96% in July 2021 led the headline retail inflation to cool off to three months low. Though sharp vegetables deflation was mainly responsible for a sharp decline in food inflation, a strong base effect both at food as well as headline inflation was also on play in July 2021,” Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist, India Ratings and Research, said in a research note. The easing of prices also means supply bottlenecks are being fixed as states relaxed lockdown restrictions, said Ashok Agrawal, an analyst with Comtrade, a commodities trading firm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/july-retail-inflation-eases-to-5-5-to-stay-within-rbi-s-limits-101628783327171.html

The Court while issuing notice on an appeal filed by the Gujarat government challenging the HC order, also agreed to examine whether the release of convicts under the Bombay Furlough and Parole Rules 1959 (applicable to Gujarat) and the provision of furlough for life convicts “every year” referred to a calendar year or the duration of a year after the last release on furlough.The bench of Justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah said, “Pending further orders, there shall be a stay of the operation of the impugned order of the Single Judge of the High Court dated 24 June 2021, directing the release of the respondent on furlough for a period of two weeks.”Sai was convicted in a rape case by a Surat court in April 2019 on a complaint by two women that they were raped between 2002 and 2005 at a Surat ashram run by him and his father Asaram Bapu. The trial court sentenced him to life under Section 376 (rape), 377 (unnatural offences), 323 (assault), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.In December 2020, Sai was granted a two-week furlough to visit his ailing mother in Ahmedabad. Six months later, he appealed for furlough again and was granted one by the Gujarat High Court on June 24. However, the High Court by a separate order stayed his release. This order was to expire on Friday.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appearing for Gujarat pointed out that the Furlough Rules of 1959 clearly state that under Rule 17, no prisoner has a legal right for furlough. He read out a 2006 judgment of the Supreme Court which affirmed the view that furlough is not an absolute right and the purpose behind it is to periodically allow the convict to have family association and avoid the ill-effects of continuous stay in jail.The bench said, “What is prevailing in our mind is whether the expression “every year” as occurring in the proviso to Rule 3(2) of the 1959 Rules refers to once every calendar year or that at least a year should elapse since it was last availed. We will examine this question.”According to the proviso to Rule 3(2), a prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment may be released on furlough “every year”, after he completes seven years actual imprisonment. Sai was arrested in December 2013 from Haryana in the present case. He had spent nearly seven-and-a-half years in prison and was entitled for furlough.Mehta further stated that the Rules also provide denial of furlough if the Commissioner of Police feels that the release of the convict will not serve the interests of public peace and tranquility or the conduct of prisoner, in the opinion of the Jail Superintendent, is not satisfactory.The state submitted that Sai was convicted of an offence of rape and the Director General of Police had issued an order on May 8, 2021 detailing the circumstances impinging on public peace and tranquility if he was released. Solicitor General said that Sai commanded a huge number of followers inside the state. While in custody, he tried to intimidate and bribe the investigating officer and three crucial witnesses in the case were killed, Mehta submitted.When the bench asked why the state did not oppose the first grant of furlough, Mehta informed that the state did not adopt an adversarial approach and treated his request for meeting mother on a purely humanitarian consideration. Opposing his subsequent furlough request, Mehta argued, “He is claiming furlough as a matter of right that will accrue to him every year. This cannot be accepted”Sai was represented in Court by advocate Sanjiv Punalekar who accepted notice and agreed to respond within a week. The bench posted the matter for hearing next on August 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-stays-release-of-narayan-sai-on-furlough-101628781046899.html

The 23-year-old, who is the first Olympic medal winner from Assam, landed at Guwahati’s Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi airport from New Delhi and was welcomed by a host of dignitaries led by Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. A large crowd of overjoyed supporters and a big posse of journalists were also present. “I am very happy to have brought a medal to Assam with all your love and blessings. I want to thank each and every one of you. It’s been a year since I last came to Assam. I have no words to express my feelings. I am sad that I wasn’t able to return with the gold medal,” said an emotional Lovlina after her arrival. “I promise all of you that I will be back with the gold medal after Paris Olympics. The journey and struggles have been tough, but I have never wavered from my goal. I never cried during my struggles, but my tears started flowing the moment I reached Assam,” she said later at an event. A special welcome ceremony was held at Guwahati’s Srimanta Shankardev Kalakshetra auditorium where CM Sarma announced a number of gifts and offers for Lovlina from the state government. “Lovlina has expressed regret at not winning gold and promised to win gold in Paris. But we are not worried about the future. We are happy and proud that she has given Assam the rare pleasure of an Olympic medal after a 125-year wait. She is an inspiration for millions now. All our blessings and good wishes are with her,” CM Sarma said in his speech.

Sarma also announced ₹10 lakh each to four of Lovlina’s coaches, Prasanta Das, Padum Boro, Sandhya Gurung and Rafael Bergamasco, for their contribution in helping her to achieve her dream of an Olympic medal. “I would be happy if more youngsters are inspired and take up sports. There’s lot of talent in the rural areas of Assam and all over the Northeast and if they are given ample opportunity they will represent the country and bring more laurels. I urge all parents to encourage their children to take up sports as a career,” Lovlina said. The event was attended by Assam’s athletic hero Bhogeswar Baruah, winner of 800 m gold for men at 1966 Asian Games, speaker Biswajit Daimary, Lovlina’s father Tiken Borgohain and a host of other dignitaries.

Earlier in May, taking note of the rising Covid-19 cases in the country, the Supreme Court had passed directions for decongestion of prisons and ordered the release of all those prisoners who were granted bail or parole last year in view of the pandemic. “Earlier in August, we had decided to release 63 convicts, including two women. On Thursday, we decided to release another 73 life convicts, including seven women,” said Mamata Banerjee, chief minister of West Bengal. The male convicts are all aged above 60 years; while the female convicts are aged above 55 years. “There was a need to decongest the prisons because of the prevailing Covid-19 situation. Section 432 of the CrPC empowers the state government to consider the premature release of life convicts who have already served 14 years in jails,” a senior official of the state government had earlier said. The state sentence review board recommended the release of these life convicts on humanitarian grounds considering their age and their conduct. At present there are 60 correctional homes in the state, which include seven central correctional homes, five special correctional homes and one women’s correctional home among others. “While the total capacity of our correctional homes is around 21,500 there are around 23,000 – 24,000 in jails across the state,” said an official of the jail department while adding that the 63 convicts would be released once the necessary formalities are completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-decongest-prisons-amid-covid-19-bengal-to-release-73-life-convicts-101628774206475.html
12-08-2021||India||UP 2022: Poll issues may overshadow personalities||As the chief ministerial candidates in the fray are all tried and tested, this time around, poll issues may play a dominant role in the 2022 Uttar Pradesh (UP) assembly elections.In UP, the last three assembly elections were eclipsed by personalities. People witnessed the rule of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP)’s Mayawati, Samajwadi Party (SP)’s Akhilesh Yadav, and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s Yogi Adityanath. The report cards of these three tenures are now ready.It was Mayawati’s social engineering that paved the way for the BSP’s victory in 2007. However, the 2012 and 2017 assembly elections were primarily driven by personalities.In 2012, Akhilesh Yadav, who rode the anti-incumbency wave against the Mayawati government, crisscrossed the state on his bicycle, mobilising the support of first-time voters, backward classes and Muslims. His father Mulayam Singh Yadav worked behind the scenes, micro-managing the election that eventually launched his son, whom he fondly called Tipu. Then, in 2017, voters were captured by the charisma of Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi. Adityanath then shifted base from the Gorakhnath mutt to the chief minister’s chair.The three leaders are no longer fresh faces. People know their acts of omission and commission, and they have their respective domains as well. It is only Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who can be the only new claimant for the chief minister’s position. She comes without any baggage, except for the Congress’s dismal health, both nationally and within the state.Also Read | The outcome of the Monsoon SessionThus, it is likely that poll issues will overshadow personalities, despite caste combinations being an integral component of elections in UP. All political parties have already begun fixing the caste matrix.For instance, while both the SP and the BSP are wooing the disgruntled Brahmins, the ruling BJP tried to give representation to backward castes in the central Cabinet during the recent expansion. They even inducted a Lodh leader as minister to fill in the vacuum that Kalyan Singh’s ailment caused.As of now, the Opposition is banking on Covid-19 mismanagement, the farmers’ agitation, price rise and unemployment, besides the ritual of playing up anti-incumbency against the ruling dispensation.Former SP minister Abhishek Mishra, who travelled across 56 districts, claims that the people of UP may be silent, but the desire for change is strong. The main issues plaguing villages are price rise and unemployment. He also said that Brahmins are upset with the current dispensation and have decided to vote against the BJP.According to him, the SP needs an increase of 5% to 7% in their vote-share over their 2017 vote percentage on the 298 seats that they had fought in alliance with the Congress. Experts, however, believe that despite anti-incumbency, the BJP’s tally will not fall by more than 100 seats from 325 seats won (including those of allies) in the previous election. They feel that the BJP will still cross the majority mark. Both the SP and the BJP are claiming over 350 seats.Political activist and analyst from west UP, professor Satish Prakash, however, feels that the poll agenda will be clearly determined closer to the election. This, he believes, will decide the outcome. “As of now, the voter is silent but anger against the present dispensation is palpable. The key issues are unemployment and farmers’ demands,” he said.He also believes that the timing of the elections will define the agenda, adding, “Who will dare raise any other issue during a Covid wave?”Also Read | Retrospective tax: A policy based on delusion gets buriedThere is a consensus among experts who agree that the multi-cornered fight will gradually narrow down to a battle between the SP and the BJP. Thus, the anti-BJP votes may also not get divided. However, Prakash dismisses this as BJP propaganda to make the election communal.While Muslims are putting pressure on Akhilesh Yadav to ally with like-minded parties, including the Congress, the former is leaning towards a tie-up with smaller caste-based parties, apart from the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD).Former Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament (MP) Mohammad Adeeb, concerned about the split in the Muslim vote after the entry of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), feels that like-minded parties should unite on a single platform to defeat the “communal agenda” of the BJP. Without this, Muslims may even decide not to cast their votes in the election.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has indicated the party’s readiness to ally with such parties. However, the coming together of major players is unlikely. After all, the party eyeing the chair will have to contest 300 seats from a pie of 403.The BJP has already launched an intensive campaign to woo farmers and confront the Covid-19 charges against the government. PM Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, Union home minister Amit Shah, and BJP national president JP Nadda have all praised Adityanath for his management of Covid-19 and the development of the state during his term.Nadda made it clear that while Modi — the face of the party — will continue to connect with people before launching big rallies, party leaders and lawmakers should market the initiatives of the BJP government at the Centre and the state.Amit Puri, who was actively associated with late Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s election as a member of the state working committee, however, says the issues will be spelt out in the party manifesto and the political narrative be decided thereafter. But regional parties are unlikely to match the BJP’s leadership at the central or state level.Also Read | Climate crisis: No one will be sparedThe impact of cash transfers may also not be as large as parties believe that they are. The PM recently released ₹6,000 to farmers as a part of the PM-Kisan scheme. But SP leader Mishra states that farmers now understand the economics. Getting a meagre ₹6,000, while paying at least ₹50,000 or more for diesel, petrol, fertilisers and other essentials for cultivation, indicates that the price rise will be seen as a principal issue.The question remains: Who will decide the poll agenda? None of the regional parties has the wherewithal to match the BJP’s machinery. When it comes to star campaigners, both the BSP and the SP are two-leader parties -- Mayawati and SC Mishra, and Akhilesh Yadav and his wife Dimple Yadav, now that Mulayam Singh is no longer in a position to campaign for the election. As for the Congress, its only star campaigners are the Gandhis -- Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.Once the BJP deploys its entire machinery, with Union ministers descending on the state, they will attempt to set the poll agenda while the Opposition counters the BJP’s Hindutva and nationalist agenda, which has captured the psyche of a major chunk of voters.Opposition leaders, however, remain confident of the fall of the BJP in the upcoming elections. And a major part of this confidence comes from the BJP’s defeat in the West Bengal assembly election, where it won only 77 of the 294 assembly seats. The context however is different and the incumbent is walking into the election with State power and a formidable election machine. How it navigates issues is to be seen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-2022-poll-issues-may-overshadow-personalities-101628773607248.html

The high court observed that prima facie it found some impropriety in land dealings carried out by the cardinal.The case relates to the sale of 60 cents of land (100 cents is one acre) in Kochi. The sale deed in the case was finalised without even receiving the payment. In the deed, the property was also allegedly undervalued to evade taxes. The difference amount was not also allegedly deposited in the account of the diocese, and it lost ₹60 crore in the land deals executed by the cardinal between 2013 and 2018.Also Read | Kerala announces Onam bonus for govt employeesIn 2018, one Shine Varghese moved the high court with a plea that allegations against Alancherry be probed. A single bench of the court directed the police to register cases against him. The court also then pulled up the police for not registering cases against Alancherry, who was elected as the Major Archbishop in 2011. He is the senior-most priest of the country. The income tax department also imposed a fine of ₹3 crore on Ernakulam-Angamally Diocese for alleged improprieties in the land. It inspected papers after undervaluing allegations surfaced and found that the price shown in the papers was lower than the market price and the difference was not deposited in the account of the diocese.After the Ernakulam-Angamally diocese allegedly lost money due to the land deals, a section of the clergy and believers revolted against Alancherry and some of them even petitioned Pope Francis. After many complaints, police investigated the deals and found that the price shown in the deed papers was far lower than the market price. But the case failed to make any progress.The Ernakulam-Angamally diocese is the richest diocese in the country. Supporters of the Cardinal insist he was made a scapegoat and that allegations against him are flimsy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/major-archbishop-of-syro-malabar-church-to-face-trial-over-land-deals-hc-101628772694727.html

12-08-2021||India||Told CM Bommai he won’t face any trouble because of me: Deve Gowda||Janata Dal (Secular) chief HD Deve Gowda on Thursday said the newly sworn-in chief minister of Karnataka, Basavaraj Bommai, will not face any difficulties because of him.“Basavaraj Bommai came, asked for blessings from me and my wife. I told him that you would not face any problems because of me,” Gowda said on Thursday.Bommai, who replaced Yediyurappa as chief minister last month, was earlier with the JD(S) before he jumped to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) around 13 years ago.Bommai’s meeting with Deve Gowda sparked a controversy within a section of the BJP which accused the CM of sending out the wrong message to party workers ahead of the zilla and taluka panchayat elections.Gowda has been central to Karnataka’s politics for almost half a century now and enjoys a cordial relationship with Yediyurappa and Siddaramaiah, among other leaders in the state. The three have allied together and separately on various occasions for mutual benefit, both individually and at the party level.“Keep Yediyurappa with you when you run the government, comply with the (BJP) high command as well and all will be well,” Gowda said.The statements added to the possibility that the old-guard of Karnataka politics (Gowda, Siddaramaiah and Yediyurappa) were sticking to each other to retain control over the state rather than let Delhi (high command of both national parties) dictate terms.The JD(S) has also allied with the BJP and the Congress in the past, playing kingmaker on more than one occasion where the state delivered a fractured verdict.CP Yogeshwara, the former minister and BJP MLC alleged that in Yediyurappa’s government, Karnataka had a “three-party coalition”, inferring that there was a tacit arrangement between then chief minister, JD(S) and the Congress.And Bommai’s meeting with Gowda has stoked the same emotions in a few legislators.Especially Preetham Gowda, the lone BJP MLA from Hassan district, known as the bastion of the JD(S) which Gowda has represented in the past.Preetham, a first-time BJP MLA, has lashed out at Bommai for meeting Gowda and the latter hit back, almost triggering a war of words within the party.“I maintain my statement that party workers had in their mind whether it was necessary to meet Gowda within 24 hours of becoming the chief minister,” Preetham said on Wednesday. He added that the chief minister has since called him and explained the reasons for meeting Gowda.Preetham could not be reached for a comment on Dowda’s statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/told-cm-bommai-he-won-t-face-any-trouble-because-of-me-deve-gowda-101628771074476.html

12-08-2021||India||Severity of Covid-19 second wave was difficult to anticipate: S Jaishankar||Just as India helped others during the first wave of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease, several other nations stood by it when it was hit by the second wave of the pandemic, said external affairs minister S Jaishankar. Virtually addressing the annual meeting of the Confederation of Indian Industry on Thursday, Jaishankar said he now received messages of gratitude from representatives of many countries for having sent out medicines, medical teams and food supplies when it was needed the most.“We were one country that stepped out, helped others, sent out medicines, sent out medical teams, kept food supplies going for those for whom this was very important, like the Gulf. So there was a lot. Today, I get expressions of gratitude for what we did during that period,” the Union minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.“Just like we helped others in the first wave, I think the world stood by us in many respects in the second wave, especially in terms of oxygen supply, oxygenators, medicines.”Jaishankar said when the coronavirus spread for the first time, India stood out for two reasons. “One, we were decisive and largely effective in what we did. Covid-19 caught us when our health infrastructure was very rudimentary, especially in terms of what we needed to do (to combat the situation).”“Initially, the world looked at us and wondered how any country could deal with this kind of caseload and severity of pandemic. Where we are today, I think the world understands and appreciates that we have pulled up our socks, shown national resolve. We have come through a test of fire.”“When the second wave of the pandemic hit us, it was a very different situation. The scale, intensity, seriousness was something very difficult to anticipate. Particularly because of the delta variant of the coronavirus, it had some very specific implications in terms of oxygen demand which went up eight-nine times,” he said.“All of that was erected out of nothing at that time and everybody stepped forward. I think the industry did a magnificent job, the government did everything it could to motivate people to get everybody to understand the seriousness of what happened,” Jaishankar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/severity-of-covid-19-second-wave-was-difficult-to-anticipate-s-jaishankar-101628767977023.html
12-08-2021||India||BKU faction seeks feedback on contesting polls||A faction of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, a farmers’ outfit protesting against three agricultural laws enacted by the Modi government last year, on Thursday launched a Twitter poll for views on whether it should context elections, taking an idea it has been toying with to the public. The Bhupinder Singh Mann-led faction, mainly active in Punjab, said this was the second time it had launched such a drive to test political waters and it has yet to take a decision. The last poll in August showed over two-thirds of the public wanted it to contest elections. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella organisation spearheading the protests, however said the platform would remain apolitical, but it would ask voters in upcoming state elections to cast their votes against the Bharatiya Janata Party, which rules both at the Centre and poll-bound Uttar Pradesh. Farm unions have been on protests since last November, demanding the government roll back three agricultural laws that seek to bring a more liberal regime of farm trade. The government has argued that these reforms are necessary to modernise the farm sector, while the farmers say the changes will leave them at the mercy of large corporations. Also Read | Farm labourers attempt to gherao Amarinder’s residence in Patiala“We as farmers’ collective organisation have already made three decisions. One, we will tell farmers to vote against the BJP. Two, we will not ask farmers to vote for any particular party and three, we will not allow any political party to campaign from our platform,” Hannan Mollah, a key member of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha said. The faction which has asked for public’s suggestion on whether it should contest polls said it will decide only after detailed deliberations and the Twitter poll is just one of them. “We believe it is time for farmers to act politically, but we have not taken any decision yet on registering a political party,” Jai Singh, a spokesperson of the outfit said. Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said in the just-concluded Parliament session that the Union government was ready to discuss the farm laws and their provisions with protesting farmers but there was no possibility of repealing the legislation. The minister also said the system of assured prices for agricultural produce, known as minimum support prices (MSP), would continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bku-faction-seeks-feedback-on-contesting-polls-101628768014364.html

12-08-2021||India||'UPA passed 1 bill every 4 minutes': Govt comeback on 'no discussion' charge||The Centre on Thursday lashed out at Opposition parties for protesting on road in the national capital and alleged that "anarchy" has always been the their agenda. But despite the disruptions, the number of bills passed per day during this session in Rajya Sabha was the second highest since 2014, said Union ministers Piyush Goyal, Pralhad Joshi and Anurag Thakur at a press conference.The ministers said that the time lost due to interruptions/adjournments till August 11 was 76 hours 26 minutes, with the daily average being 4 hours 30 minutes.But in the face of all the chaos and disruption, 22 bills were passed in the both houses of Parliament, including two appropriation bills relating to the supplementary demands for grants for 2021-22 and the demands for excess grants for 2017-2018. The ministers said that this reflects the commitment, productivity and ability of the central government to drive legislative agenda in Parliament, which aims to fulfill the aspirations of its citizens.Nineteen of these bills were passed in the Rajya Sabha, including the crucial constitutional amendment bill on OBC reservation, the ministers said. All these bills were in national interest and will benefit the poor, OBCs, workers, entrepreneurs and all sections of the society, the ministers further said.They also took a jibe at the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, which was in power from 2004 to 2014, saying they passed 18 bills in a hasty manner. This was in response to Opposition allegation that the government is passing the bills without any discussion.In a release issued after the ministers' press conference, the government listed the bills which were passed by the preceding dispensation at the Centre. These included the Delhi Special Police Establishment (Amendment) Bill, which was passed in 2006 in just three minutes, the release said. On an average, the Centre said, the UPA government passed 17 bills in 72 mins, or one bill approximately every four minutes.On August 7, 2006, the Lok Sabha passed the Government Securities Bill in just 14 minutes; in 2007, the National Institution of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (Amendment) bill was passed in four minutes, while Banking Regulation (Amendment) and National Tax Tribunal (Amendment) bills were cleared in five minutes, it further said.The Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill was cleared in just two minutes on March 19, 2007, the government further said.During the recently-concluded monsoon session of Parliament, the Opposition forced adjournments in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha over their demands including repeal of three farm laws and probe into allegations of surveillance using Pegasus spyware.The session was curtailed two days before its scheduled end date (of August 13) due to Opposition ruckus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/upa-passed-1-bill-every-4-minutes-govt-comeback-on-no-discussion-charge-101628767053498.html

12-08-2021||India||Opposition MPs proud of their unruly conduct in Parliament, says Goyal||Union ministers Piyush Goyal, Anurag Thakur and parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi condemned the behaviour of MPs from the Opposition parties even as they said the parliamentarians ‘refused’ to apologise for what the ‘ruckus’ they caused in the House.These Union ministers were also joined by minister for minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, minister for education Dharmendra Pradhan and newly inducted Union minister Bhupender Yadav all of whom claimed that the Opposition was adamant of continuing with their behaviour.“Forget about apologising, when asked the MPs said they would do the same thing again, multiple times if required. The MPs from Congress, Trinamool Congress and Aam Aadmi Party have set a new low with this behaviour. Their actions have lowered the respect people have for the Parliament,” Goyal said during the press conference.Congress hits out at govt over ‘manhandling’ of women lawmakers in Rajya SabhaGoyal blamed the Congress for the ‘ruckus’ and said their actions are condemnable as he demanded strict action be taken against the MPs. He said that the tables and chairs in the Parliament are not kept for ‘protesting by standing on top of them’ and ‘rule books are to be studied and referred to and not hurled at the Chair’.‘Not comparing but this was exceptional’: JoshiParliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said this was not the first time that Parliament saw ruckus over issues but termed the behaviour by the Opposition MPs on Wednesday ‘unbelievable’. Joshi said the Opposition should refrain from saying that the government passed bills in a hurry.“Between 2004 and 2014, one can see how many bills were passed amid din. At that time, discussions with the Opposition were not properly held. I was impaired that time and even an important bill like bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh was passed amid din. We talked with them daily regarding discussing important bills but they are denying it now. They tried to forcibly enter by breaking the glass,” Joshi said.Goyal criticises PawarUnion minister Piyush Goyal said that he respects the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar even as he claimed that the senior leader was misinformed about Wednesday’s incident. The minister said that before levelling allegations against the marshals and claiming that outsiders were brought into the Parliament and women MPs were attacked, Sharad Pawar should first take into cognisance that Opposition MPs themselves tweeted the videos where they were seen being unruly. “Did he see the videos tweeted by the Opposition leaders who were proud of their conduct? Rulebooks were hurled at the Chair. God forbid that no one got hurt,” Goyal said. Goyal was responding to Sharad Pawar’s allegations where he said that outsiders misbehaved and hurt women MPs.Women MPs accuse marshals of pushing them around in Rajya SabhaCongress writes to Vice President and Rajya Sabha chairperson NaiduFollowing Sharad Pawar’s allegation, the Congress and other Opposition parties also wrote to Rajya Sabha chairperson M Venkaiah Naidu that women MPs were subjected to ‘unacceptable (use of) force’.“A very large number of security personnel, who were not part of the regular ... watch and ward staff of the Rajya Sabha Secretariat were deployed. They used unacceptable force and physically manhandled Members of Parliament, including women members,” Kharge wrote in his letter which was also signed by Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s (DMK) Tiruchi Siva and Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut among others.Addressing a press conference earlier in the day, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi said that for the first time MPs were ‘assaulted’ inside the House while the BJP ministers while addressing the media separately said that the Opposition MPs should apologise and strict action will be taken after thorough investigation into what happened earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-mps-proud-of-their-unruly-conduct-in-parliament-says-goyal-101628764910751.html

12-08-2021||India||India gave last draft on possible agreement on Kashmir issue in March 2007: New paper||The Indian side provided Pakistan the last draft on a possible agreement on the Kashmir issue in March 2007 following nearly three years of secret negotiations before talks stopped because of a political crisis in Islamabad, according to a new paper from Georgetown University. The paper, by Jawaharlal Nehru University associate professor Happymon Jacob, is based on interviews with Indian and Pakistani officials who were involved in the back channel negotiations on the Kashmir dispute and contains hitherto unknown aspects of the efforts to resolve the issue by then Pakistani military ruler Pervez Musharraf and prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh. Riaz Mohammad Khan, who was Pakistan’s foreign secretary during 2005-08, said the Indian side gave the last draft in early March 2007, which was “close to what might have become the final document” if negotiations hadn’t come to a halt. The Pakistani side didn’t get an opportunity to return the draft with its comments because of the sudden political crisis which sent the Musharraf government into a tailspin. Also Read | Taliban won’t talk to Afghan govt until Ashraf Ghani remains Prez: Imran KhanOn March 9, 2007, Musharraf had unconstitutionally suspended Pakistan’s then chief justice, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, and this triggered massive political protests that weakened the military ruler. Following elections the next year, Musharraf was pressured by political parties to quit as president in August 2008. The paper, titled “The Kashmir Back Channel: India-Pakistan Negotiations on Kashmir from 2004 to 2007” and prepared for the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University, recounts secret negotiations between the two sides for the proposed agreement on Kashmir that involved what came to be known as the “four-point formula”. The stage for the negotiations on Kashmir was set by a ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) in November 2003, which itself was the outcome of behind-the-scenes talks between then Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) chief CD Sahay and the then head of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Lt Gen Ehsan-ul-Haq, who met at undisclosed locations outside the subcontinent. In January 2004, Musharraf had a “quiet discussion” with Tariq Aziz, who later became Pakistan’s pointperson for negotiations with India, and India’s then national security adviser Brajesh Mishra that kick-started talks on how to move forward on the Kashmir issue. Despite a change in government in India following Vajpayee’s defeat in the general election, the “dedicated Kashmir back channel itself effectively began only in late 2004, after the Manmohan Singh government took office in New Delhi in May 2004”, according to the paper. Several local and international factors helped facilitate the secret talks, including Vajpayee’s outreach to Kashmiris in 2003 and encouragement from the US government, which was keen to ensure there was no India-Pakistan friction while Washington and its allies were busy with the war on terror in Afghanistan. Also Read | A new Afghan warSatinder Lambah, who served as Manmohan Singh’s special envoy for Kashmir, has said the proposed agreement was based on a four-point formula that would include no redrawing of borders, the people of Jammu and Kashmir on either side of the LoC being able to move freely from one side to the other, an end to hostility, violence, and terrorism and military forces on both sides being kept to the minimum, ensure self-governance on both sides of the LoC, and consultative mechanisms to look into socio-economic issues. However, Pakistani and Indian officials are divided on whether a draft agreement was in place by early 2007. Riaz Khan, Pakistan’s former foreign secretary Jalil Abbas Jeelani and former foreign minister Khurshid Kasuri believe the draft was ready, with Kasuri even contending it was “ready for signature”. But former Indian national security adviser MK Narayanan said this was not a “formal diplomatic agreement of any kind”, and at most, it “must have been a discussion paper, exchange of which is routine in diplomatic negotiations before a final deal is reached”. The two countries were also divided on the matter managing issues of mutual concern in Jammu and Kashmir, with the Pakistani side favouring “joint mechanisms”, while the Indian side wanted “consultative arrangements”, according to the paper. Once signed, the deal was designed to be in force for 15 to 20 years, after which the two sides would revisit it. “Indian officials seem to think that the phrase ‘joint mechanisms’ infringes on the sovereign claims of each state on J&K. There is little clarity whether the document that was close to being finalised in 2007 had mentioned joint or consultative mechanisms,” the paper states. Though this was the first time India and Pakistan engaged in sustained and structured back-channel negotiations to resolve the Kashmir issue, Musharraf’s political woes resulted in things running aground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-paper-on-india-pakistan-back-channel-talks-on-kashmir-during-200407-101628761774290.html
12-08-2021||India||Congress hits out at govt over ‘manhandling’ of women lawmakers in Rajya Sabha||The Congress on Thursday hit out at the government over the alleged manhandling of women lawmakers in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday with Rahul Gandhi saying this was the first time in India’s history that parliamentarians were “beaten up” inside the Upper House.In a letter to Rajya Sabha chairperson Venkaiah Naidu, Mallikarjun Kharge, the Opposition Leader in the Upper House, condemned “unacceptable (use of ) force” and “manhandling of the MPs including women members.”“A very large number of security personnel, who were not part of the regular ... watch and ward staff of the Rajya Sabha Secretariat were deployed. They used unacceptable force and physically manhandled Members of Parliament, including women members,” he wrote. He added the incident was shocking and also an “unprecedented insult to our democracy and the very dignity of the House.”Also Read | Cong handles locking row: Twitter says rules enforced judiciously, impartiallyKhrage said Opposition MPs were stopped from protesting against the General Insurance (Amendment) Bill on which he said there was a “wide consensus” that it should be sent to a select committee for a review. He called the government’s approach “authoritarian” and said the Opposition will continue to struggle against the “assault on Parliamentary democracy.”Gandhi separately condemned the alleged assault. “Today (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi and RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh)... are attacking the Constitution... Whenever we try to raise the voice about minorities or women... they (the government) do not let us speak. First time ever in the history of India, lawmakers were beaten up in Rajya Sabha. This nation is wise... there will be a storm to uproot this government. Congress’s works remind India that Indians can stand in front of any power.”On Wednesday, women Opposition MPs accused male marshals of pushing them around in Rajya Sabha. “The female marshals were stopping us (from protesting). When we asked them to move away, the male marshals came forward and pushed us. One of my colleagues fell on the floor,” Chayya Verma, a Rajya Sabha member of Congress said.Phulo Devi Netam, Verma’s party colleague, echoed her saying the government deployed the marshals in three layers. “The male marshals started pushing the female lawmakers. Do not they know how to respect the female parliamentarians?” she asked. Another lawmaker added that everything was on record and called for an inquiry.Prahalad Joshi, the parliamentary affairs minister, called the claims of women lawmakers “bogus” and a “blatant lie”. “Nothing like this has happened. All the CCTV cameras should be checked. In fact (they) manhandled the male marshals. They grabbed these male marshals by their necks. They were especially from TMC (Trinamool Congress). ...together pushed the female marshals,” he said. He added they have demanded that a committee should be constituted to inquire into the matter.Shortly before the Upper House was adjourned sine die on Wednesday, Opposition lawmakers staged a walkout following a ruckus. They objected to the presence of security personnel during the passage of the insurance bill. The Opposition has been objecting to the passage of key Bills without discussion and putting them to vote.The Monsoon Session of Parliament came to a premature end on Wednesday when it was adjourned ahead of schedule. Protests by the Opposition and repeated disruptions marred the session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-hits-out-at-govt-over-manhandling-of-women-lawmakers-in-rajya-sabha-101628761475590.html

12-08-2021||India||Breakthrough infections not as high as Centre says: Kerala||The Kerala health department has started a study on rampant breakthrough infections, and re-infections in the state even as it rejected the Centre’s numbers on breakthrough cases in the state. Breakthrough is when a fully vaccinated person gets infected again and re-infection refers to a completely recovered individual getting infected again with the virus. The state health department said while the Union health ministry quoted 40,000 breakthrough infections in Kerala, its rough estimate, it would be between 5,000-6,000 cases. “We have no idea about 40,000 cases as mentioned by the Union health ministry. Our estimate is less than 0.1% that means around 5000-5500 breakthrough cases,” said a senior health official who did not want to be named. The Union health ministry said the country had reported over 100,000 breakthrough cases of which Kerala’s share was 40,000. Later, a Central team visiting the state earlier this month also confirmed high incidences of breakthrough cases in Kerala. They said Pathanamthitta district alone reported more than 7,000 breakthrough cases. Also Read | Kerala reports 23,500 Covid cases, 116 deathsBut district medical officer Dr AL Sheeja refuted these statistics. “Only 258 such cases were reported in the district. I have no idea how they got such large numbers,” she said. Earlier, health minister Veena George, hailing from the same district, also denied a spike in breakthrough infections in Pathanamthitta. The health department has sent samples of all breakthrough infections for genome sequencing to rule out the possibility of a new variant. Though experts suspected a new variant behind steady rise of cases in the state the Indian Council of Medical Research is yet to confirm it. For almost two months, the state has been reporting more than half the national caseload. On Wednesday, it reported 23,500 cases with a test positivity rate of 14.49% when 162,130 samples were tested, said the state health ministry. It also reported 116 deaths, taking total fatalities to 18,120. Test positivity rate is the number of tests returning positive out of total tests done for a particular infection.Among breakthrough infections, health workers form a large chunk. Twenty-four-year-old nursing officer Gokul MG, who works with a medical college hospital in Thiruvananthpauram, was down with Covid-19 twice, first in August and second in November. He continues to work without a break, and has got his two vaccine jabs. He says,“How can I rest when people need me the most.” Like him, there are many health workers who were infected more than twice. Now the health department has asked all workers who come in contact with patients to undergo regular antigen or RT-PCR tests. The Central team which visited the eight worst-affected districts found that high density of population, prevalence of highly-infectious Delta virus and laxity in home quarantine are main reasons for high caseload.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/breakthrough-infections-not-as-high-as-centre-sayskerala-101628755053669.html

"The security marshals were called in yesterday during the passage of the insurance amendment bill to privatise general insurance companies in the Rajya Sabha," Raut was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. "Do you want to scare us?" he then reportedly asked.Raut also alleged that the opposition didn't get a chance to present their views in Parliament. "Yesterday's incident against women MPs was against democracy. It felt like we were standing at the Pakistan border," ANI quoted Raut as saying.Raut also asserted that the "opposition is united" against the ruling government. He also informed that Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi on August 20, when she will speak to the chief ministers of Congress-ruled states.Earlier also, Raut lashed out at the Centre by posting a photo from the chaos and wrote "Marshall law in Temple of Democracy."Two days before the scheduled conclusion, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha have adjourned sine die on Wednesday. During the monsoon session, the opposition continuously protested and forced adjournments for their demands, including a probe into allegations of surveillance through Pegasus spyware and the repeal of the three farm laws.On Wednesday, parliamentary affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi alleged that opposition members "manhandled marshals" in the Rajya Sabha and said their behaviour during the session was a "black spot in the history of Indian democracy".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-is-united-cm-thackeray-to-take-part-in-sonia-gandhi-s-cm-meet-says-raut-101628751094240.html

"Today, we had to come out here to speak to you (media) as we (opposition) are not allowed to speak in Parliament. This is murder of democracy," Gandhi said at Vijay Chowk in Delhi.The opposition leaders on Thursday marched towards Vijay Chowk from Parliament in Delhi over the demand to repeal the three farm laws. The opposition MPs were seen carrying the placards saying 'Black farm laws'."The Parliament session is over. As far as 60% of the country is concerned there has been no Parliament session. The voice of 60% of the country has been crushed, humiliated and yesterday in the Rajya Sabha physically beaten," Gandhi stated, according to news agency ANI.Meanwhile, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor alleged that the Centre doesn't want to run Parliament proceedings properly.

12-08-2021||India||Immune cells fail to communicate, cause cytokine storm in Covid patients: Study||Immune cells fail to communicate and often result in a fatal cytokine storm due to a drop in a particular protein level in Covid-19 patients, a team of researchers from India and the US has found. Cytokine storm is an overreaction of the immune system and involves overproduction of cytokines.“Quorum sensing or communication between bacterial cells is well known. But in our research, we showed that such quorum sensing also takes place between macrophages (white blood cells that eat bacteria and dying cells) and this interaction takes place with the help of a protein called gelsolin,” said Partho Sarothi Ray, who led the team, and is in the US for research work.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has summoned Ray, an associate professor at Kolkata’s Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), more than once in connection with its probe into violence in Maharashtra’s Bhima Koregaon in 2018. “I once worked closely with (activist and Jesuit priest) Stan Swamy. Many persons have already been arrested and I am not sure what would happen in the future. I have already been summoned for questioning as a witness in the Bhima Koregaon case since 2020. I told the NIA that I am ready to face their questions via video conferencing.”Swamy, who worked for tribal rights in Jharkhand for five decades, was arrested under an anti-terror law in October 2020. He spent over eight months in jail awaiting trial before he died in a Mumbai hospital in July.Swamy, 84, was the oldest of 16 activists and lawyers arrested on charges of conspiring to foment violence at Bhima Koregaon, which was rocked by caste clashes during the bicentennial celebration of a British-era war by Dalits. The priest was accused of having Maoist connections and working for their frontal organisations.NIA sleuths have visited the IISER campus looking for Ray. “He has not come to the institute for almost a year now. We do not know where he is. His (Indian) number is switched off,” said an IISER faculty member, requesting anonymity.Ray was arrested in 2012 and released 10 days later after he took part in a protest against an eviction drive in a slum. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee then claimed Maoists were behind the protests.Also Read | Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee invited to attend peace conference in RomeAn NIA official said Ray has been summoned as a witness. “The investigating officer has been in touch with him for the past one year. He is presently in the US for training. He said that he cannot come to India and appear for questioning citing Covid-19,” said the official, requesting anonymity.The findings of the Ray-led team, meanwhile, were published in the August 6 edition of The Journal of Immunology, a peer-reviewed journal published by The American Association of Immunologists.“While putting up the body’s first line of defence, the macrophage cells ‘talk’ to each other to assess their own potential and keep on releasing cytokine. But in a Covid-19 patient’s body, the communication between macrophages fails because there is a drop in the protein gelsolin. As the macrophages can’t communicate, they keep on releasing cytokine which ultimately results in the cytokine storm,” said Ray.Ray said their research also shows that the fall in gelsolin is triggered because of an enhancement of miR-21 RNA. “Clinical trials have already started even before the research was published,” he said. He added the research was carried out on macrophage cells of rats.Ray’s team of researchers included Reshma Kumari Sharma, Binita Goswami, Sukhen Das Mandal and Abhishek Guha (IISER), and Belinda Willard (Cleveland Clinic).Experts have called the findings of Ray and his team landmark and said they can be applied for treating not just Covid-19 but particularly inflammatory diseases. “This research has got some implications in the wide array of other diseases besides Covid-19. The outcome may be exploited in several inflammatory diseases viz auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and inflammatory bowel syndrome, Alzheimer’s disease, gout, and infectious diseases such as influenza, dengue etc. Potential therapeutic applications are expected from this basic immunobiology research that made the work interesting,” said SN Joardar, professor, veterinary microbiology at West Bengal University of Animal and Fishery Sciences. “This research paper shows that if there is a fall in gelsolin level, the cytokine storm erupts and that if gelsolin can be supplied to the patient, the cytokine storm may be stopped. But like gelsolin, there are several other compounds which macrophage cells need to communicate among themselves. In the past, research has been done on some other compounds by other scientists who used rat cells. Human trial is yet to be done,” said Pratip Kundu, former head of the School of Tropical Medicine in Kolkata.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/immune-cells-fail-to-communicate-cause-cytokine-storm-in-covid-patients-study-101628750973650.html

Accounts of Randeep Singh Surjewala, Ajay Maken, Sushmita Dev, and Manickam Tagore were among those temporarily locked, Congress functionaries aware of the matter said.The party’s official handle, on Instagram, posted a screenshot of Twitter’s message informing the party that its account has been locked.“The official Twitter account of the Congress party has been locked by Twitter India. Modi ji, just how afraid are you? Reminder: The Congress party fought for our nation’s independence, equipped only with truth, non-violence & the will of the people. We won then, we’ll win again,” the caption underneath the screenshot read.A post shared by Congress (@incindia)Rohan Gupta, the head of Congress’s social media department, accused Twitter of working under government pressure and added it has blocked 5,000 accounts of their leaders and workers across India. “They need to understand we can’t be pressurised by Twitter or the government.”Twitter insisted it enforces its rules judiciously and impartially and added it has taken proactive action over several hundred tweets that posted the image in violation of its rules. “(Twitter)...may continue to do so in line with our range of enforcement options,” a Twitter spokesperson said. “Certain types of private information carry higher risks than others, and our aim is always to protect individuals’ privacy and safety. We strongly encourage everyone on the service to familiarise themselves with the Twitter Rules and report anything they believe is in violation.”Also Read | Rahul Gandhi’s Twitter account locked, firm tells Delhi high courtTwitter said the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) alerted it about the specific content on the platform that allegedly revealed the identity of an alleged sexual assault victim and her parents.

It earlier claimed the account was suspended before clarifying the account was temporarily locked.Twitter said the account was never suspended as such action would entail making the account inaccessible across the globe.The NCPCR earlier asked the Delhi Police and Twitter to take action against Gandhi over the photograph he posted after meeting the family of the nine-year-old girl, who was killed following an alleged sexual assault. It said the posting of the picture violated the law.Gandhi met the girl’s family and assured his support last week. “Parents’ tears are saying only one thing -- their daughter, the daughter of this country, deserves justice. And I am with them on this path to justice,” Gandhi tweeted in Hindi and posted the photo of his meeting with the girl’s relatives.Twitter took down the post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-twitter-face-off-as-accounts-of-more-leaders-are-locked-101628750793899.html
12-08-2021||India||PM’s advisory council recommends increasing retirement age||The Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister has recommended increasing the retirement age saying an increase in life expectancy is expected to continue due to better health infrastructure and allow aged people to work longer than any previous generation. In a report released on Wednesday, the Council said the retirement age needs to increase in a phased manner as India is a young nation with a high working population. “...increasing retirement ages leads to job creation for old persons without compromising the needs and the availability of jobs for the current workforce,” said the report released by the Council’s chairman, Bibek Debroy.The report also underlined delaying retirement age to increase the working-age population or it may not reduce the pressure on the social security system and is difficult for a country to achieve. “ A rise in the retirement age, unless backed by social action and a series of other measures, won’t be enough to bridge the pensions gap and ensure the active ageing of an older person,” it said.Also Read | PM Modi to participate in ‘Atmanirbhar Narishakti se Samvad’ todayThe report has recommended upskilling and reskilling opportunities for people in their 50s and the 60s. “Both central and state governments should formulate policies that support the reskilling efforts. These efforts should not exclude older workers in the informal economy, those living in remote rural areas, members of ethnic minorities, refugees and migrants who often have poor access to training.”According to data released by Help Age International, a global network of organisations working with and for older people, over 10% of India’s total population (about 139 million people) were aged over 60 as of 2019. The proportion of elderly is expected to double to 19.5% by 2050 when 1 in 5 people is likely to be a senior citizen. Kerala has a maximum proportion of older people (12.5%), followed by Goa (11.20%) and Tamil Nadu (10.4%). The higher proportion of elderly in Southern India is a result of a reduced fertility rate and fewer children. Kerala and Tamil Nadu have fertility rates of 1.7, which is lower than the replacement levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pms-advisory-council-recommends-increasing-retirement-age-101628749413589.html
12-08-2021||India||Women MPs accuse marshals of pushing them around in Rajya Sabha||Chhaya Verma, a Congress member of Rajya Sabha, has accused male marshals of pushing women members of the Opposition around in the House on Wednesday.“The female marshals were stopping us (from protesting). When we asked them to move away, the male marshals came forward and pushed us. One of my colleagues fell on the floor.”Phulo Devi Netam, Verma’s party colleague, echoed her and said the government deployed the marshals in three layers. “The male marshals started pushing the female lawmakers. Do not they know how to respect the female parliamentarians?” she asked.Another lawmaker said everything is on record and called for an inquiry.Shortly before the Upper House was adjourned sine die on Wednesday, Opposition lawmakers staged a walkout following a ruckus. They objected to the presence of security personnel during the passage of the Insurance (Amendment) Bill. The Opposition has been objecting to the passage of key Bills without discussion and putting them to vote.Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said there were more marshals than members in Rajya Sabha. He also alleged the marshals manhandled some of the women MPs and said women were not safe even within Parliament.The monsoon session of Parliament came to a premature end on Wednesday when it was adjourned ahead of schedule. Protests by the Opposition and repeated disruptions marred the session.Prahalad Joshi, parliamentary affairs ministers, called the claims of women lawmakers “bogus” and a “blatant lie”. “Nothing like this has happened. All the CCTV cameras should be checked. In fact (they) manhandled the male marshals. They grabbed these male marshals by their necks. They were especially from TMC (Trinamool Congress). ...together pushed the female marshals,” he said. He added they have demanded that a committee should be constituted to inquire into the matter.Nationalist Congress Party leader Sharad Pawar condemned the alleged attack on women lawmakers. “In my 55 years of parliamentary career, I have never seen the way the women MPs were attacked... More than 40 men and women were brought into the House from outside. It is painful. It is an attack on democracy.”Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said there was a fine discussion on the constitutional amendment bill empowering states to draw their own list of other backward classes. “Then there was a bill regarding insurance regulation… Though a copy of the bill was already circulated among the members, the way the (Opposition while protesting) unleashed violence on the security personnel and marshals…. shatters democratic principles. This makes one thing clear that Congress and its partners have lost their ethics.”He said this happened when ministers Joshi and Piyush Goyal were repeatedly telling the Opposition that government is ready for a debate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/women-mps-accuse-marshals-of-pushing-them-around-in-rajya-sabha-101628749293779.html

But a "performance anomaly" made the mission unsuccessful.That anomaly was observed in the cryogenic stage, said Isro chairman K Sivan.The 51.70-metre tall rocket lifted off as planned at 05.43am, and its performance in the first and second stages was normal, the space agency said.Watch: Isro's GSLV blasts off but 'tech anomaly' cuts off missionWhat are the stages of rocket launch?A rocket launch has been divided by space agencies across the world in stages, where different thrusters and others parts help a vehicle reach desired destination in space. Depending on the distance to be covered, the space vehicle can go upto five stages, but broadly there are three. The heaviest part is the first stage, which uses the largest rocket engines the largest fuel and oxidiser tanks, and the highest thrust. Its task is to impart the initial thrust needed to overcome Earth's gravity.After the fuel in first stage thrusters is used up, they detach and fall back on Earth, either in ocean or sparsely populated areas. The second stage now kicks in, with separate rocket engines and propellants which continues to accelerate the vehicle.This engine too detaches itself after the intended use and falls back towards the Earth. But this time, the parts mostly disintegrate and evaporate after encountering atmospheric heating on its fall back toward Earth. The third stage then kicks in to help the space vehicle gain orbital velocity. Each of these stages are lighter than its predecessor and the entire operation is monitored by a mission control centre.The GSLV used by Isro for today's launch was a four-stage rocket.What is the cryogenic stage?A cryogenic stage is the last stage of space launch vehicles, which makes use of cryogenics. The word refers to technology of sub-zero temperature where production and behaviour of materials is studied at below -150 degree Centigrade.According to Isro website, a cryogenic rocket stage is more efficient and provides more thrust for every kilogram of propellant it burns compared to solid and earth-storable liquid propellant rocket stages.However, cryogenic stage is technically a very complex system compared to solid or earth-storable liquid propellant stages due to its use of propellants at extremely low temperatures and the associated thermal and structural problems.The anomaly in cryogenic stageMinutes after the rocket launched early on Thursday morning, the scientists were seen in discussion and it was announced in the mission control centre by the range operations director that the mission could not be accomplished fully.The engines failed to ignite in the cryogenic stage, according to Isro, which called it a "technical anomaly". "The mission couldn't be accomplished as intended," the space agency said on Twitter.The intended aim of Isro's missionThe objective of Thursday's mission was to provide near real-time imaging of large area regions at frequent intervals, for quick monitoring of natural disasters, episodic events and obtain spectral signatures for agriculture, forestry, water bodies as well as for disaster warning, cyclone monitoring, cloud burst and thunderstorm monitoring.Before today's launch, Isro had launched Brazil's earth observation satellite Amazonia-1 and 18 co-passenger satellites in February this year. Thursday's rocket launch was also planned to be held in April or May however, the Covid-19 outbreak pushed the scientists to resume it in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-gisat-1-failure-all-you-need-to-know-about-anomaly-in-cryogenic-stage-101628746705529.html

It added the treated water contained on average between 1-3.8 microplastics per litre.Also Read | Rape undertrials stripped, made to do sit-ups: Goa orders inquiryNIO’s principal scientist, Mahua Saha, said 26 types of polymers were detected in the water samples, which indicated contamination from different plastic products and sources. “This is shocking and raises serious concerns about microplastic exposure for citizens and its larger impact on health.”Packaging materials, fishing nets, PVC pipes, cloth fibres, tyre bits may be the sources for the most microplastic materials obtained during the study, the report said and blamed mismanaged solid waste and lack of effective wastewater treatment facilities for it.Both pre-treated and post-treated water was assessed for the study. The levels of microplastics in pre-treated water were higher than that which was supplied. Treatment methods didn’t completely eliminate the presence of microplastics.“Fibre was the most dominant category found in both tap water and treatment plants samples,” Saha said. Fibre, fragments and film microplastics were also found.The researchers have called for more research to understand the extent and prevalence of microplastics especially in towns that are known for being located next to industrial and manufacturing hubs.“This study was initially meant to be collecting samples from cities across the country but on account of the stringent lockdown last year, we could not get the samples and as a result, we have restricted it to Goa,” said Satish Sinha, associate director, Toxics Link.Unlike other pollutants, there is no accepted safe limit of microplastics in drinking water with research yet to establish whether any amount of microplastics could be considered safe for drinking.“Several other toxic chemicals get attached to the surface of the microplastic and add to the overall toxicity of the water,” Saha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tap-water-in-goa-contains-potentially-hazardous-microplastics-study-101628743834050.html

The Lokayukta in December last year issued a probe order against the former BJD leader following a complaint that he had amassed assets disproportionate to his known source of income. The Lokayukta asked the directorate of Vigilance to submit report within two months.The Orissa high court in February this year quashed the Lokayukta’s order for a probe. It dismissed the Lokayukta order saying it was not legally tenable as the complainant and investigating agency in a quasi-judicial process cannot be the same.Also Read | Sec 144 imposed in Odisha’s Kendrapara amid opposition to water projectThe anti-corruption body then moved a review petition before the high court which was again dismissed in April 5. The Lokayukta then moved the apex court trough a Special Leave Petition (SLP) against the high court orders in February and review petition orders in April this year, calling it unfair.In his contempt petition to the high court, Panigrahy alleged that the Lokayukta, while filing the SLP, attached a six-page order on April 5 which is non-existent. The MLA said the high court passed a two-page order dismissing the review petition, adding that the six-page judgement cited by the Lokayukta was not passed by the bench of chief justice S Muralidhar and justice Biswanath Rath.“It is not known from which source such an order was obtained by the office of the Lokayukta. A non-existent order forms part of the SLP before the highest court of the country. The Lokayukta is a sacrosanct quasi judicial body comprising two retired judges of the high court and one retired DGP did not bother to verify the authenticity of the order of the registry of the high court or from the official website of the court where orders were being regularly uploaded during the pandemic,” Panigrahy said in his contempt petition.Panigrahy was arrested on December 3 last year on charges of forgery, criminal conspiracy and cyber crime. He was released from the jail on June 12 after the high court granted him bail in connection with a job fraud case.The three-time MLA was once a close aide of the chief minister Naveen Patnaik before he was expelled from the party for alleged ‘anti-people’ activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-mla-files-contempt-petition-against-state-lokayukta-101628743413602.html

The first two stages went off fine, only after that there was a difficulty in cryogenic upper stage ignition. The mission can be re-scheduled some time again. https://t.co/U5C0wTEHHvThe GISAT-1 satellite was launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) at Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh as a part of the GSLV-F10 EOS-03 mission. The 51.70-metre tall rocket blasted off from the second launch pad of the spaceport at 5:43am as scheduled, at the end of the 26-hour countdown. The space agency even noted that rocket performance was normal in the first and second stages.Isro's mission control room, however, plunged into silence just before the seventh minute of the flight, when scientists started analysing the flight pattern. Moments later, the space agency finally declared that the mission couldn't be accomplished "as intended"."GSLV-F10 launch took place today at 0543 Hrs IST as scheduled. Performance of the first and second stages was normal. However, Cryogenic Upper Stage ignition did not happen due to technical anomaly. The mission couldn't be accomplished as intended," the space agency tweeted.This was the eighth time Isro was flying the indigenous cryogenic third stage in the vehicle. The GSLV Mk III vehicle carried the Chandrayaan-2 on its first operational flight and will be carrying astronauts to space under the Gaganyaan Mission. All of the four flights, including one sub-orbital flight, of the vehicle, have been successful.With this mission, Isro intended to place the Earth observation satellite on the Geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO), a highly elliptic geocentric orbit that almost always serves as an intermediate step for satellites before reaching for their final orbit. After that, the satellite was expected to make its way to the final geostationary orbit with the help of an onboard propulsion system.Isro said earlier that the GISAT-1 satellite would obtain spectral signatures for agriculture, forestry, mineralogy, cloud properties, snow and glaciers, and oceanography, enabling researchers back home to gain new insight on a host of issues. If the mission had been accomplished as intended, it would have paved the way for India to monitor and respond to natural disasters and any other short-term events at an alarming pace, according to officials of the space agency familiar with the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mission-can-be-re-scheduled-space-minister-after-isro-fails-to-put-gisat-1-in-orbit-101628738426002.html

As many as 31,260,050 people have recovered from as of Thursday, the data from the health ministry also showed.In a significant achievement, India's cumulative Covid-19 vaccination coverage has crossed 520 million (523,253,450) landmark milestone.Overall nationwide tally is has been hovering above 25,000 for days as some states in the country are reporting a surge in daily average cases. Though numbers are below record levels the government is still cautious of letting the guards down.Experts have predicted the possible third wave could hit the country as soon as August-end. The recent surge in cases has been mostly led by the highlight transmissible mutation of the Covid-19, Delta variant.On Wednesday, the head of the UK's Oxford Vaccine group said that the highly transmissible Delta variant of Covid-19 has rendered the prospect of herd immunity, where the majority of a country’s population becomes immune to a virus, difficult.Professor Andrew Pollard, who led the team behind the Oxford University’s Covid-19 vaccine, said that the fear of another even more transmissible variant remains a possibility and therefore there is nothing that can completely stop the deadly virus from spreading.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-logs-41-195-cases-up-from-yesterday-490-deaths-in-a-day-101628739832431.html

Known as the father of the Indian space program Vikram Sarabhai is known for the establishment of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro). In 1962, he was given Isro's charge and worked for a token salary of one rupee in view of his personal wealth.Sarabhai, who stressed the importance of the space program in India, was given two of India’s highest honours - the Padma Bhushan in 1966 and the Padma Vibhushan awarded to him posthumously in 1972. Sarabhai is credited for putting the first Indian satellite, Aryabhata, in orbit in 1975 from Russia.On his 102nd birth anniversary, the Isro launched India's "eye in the sky" GISAT-1 Earth observation satellite (EOS), but the mission suffered a setback due to a performance anomaly in the cryogenic stage of the rocket moments after the launch.He was a visionary scientist and institution-builder who called for the development of satellite-based remote sensing of natural resources. He was an inspiration to young scientists of the nation. Sarabhai’s birth anniversary is also celebrated as National Remote Sensing Day in India.Sarabhai helped set up many institutes, some of which are the Nehru Foundation for Development in Ahmedabad, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA), the Ahmedabad Textile Industry's Research Association (ATIRA) and the (CEPT).Along with his wife Mrinalini Sarabhai, he founded the Darpana Academy of Performing Arts.

Employees in shops, establishments and offices, however, will have to be fully vaccinated. Restaurants, gymnasiums and spas are allowed to operate at 50% of their capacity. The number of people allowed to attend wedding ceremonies has been increased to 200 if the venue is an open place like lawns, while the number of attendees is restricted to 100 or 50% of the sitting capacity if the venue is enclosed one. Indoor games have been allowed till 10pm provided everyone is fully vaccinated.Also Read | Maharashtra: 20 more cases of Covid Delta plus variant; total cases reaches 65With the likelihood of a third wave hitting the state, the government also made it clear that the entire state will be put under immediate lockdown if the demand for oxygen reaches 700 metric tonnes (MT) daily.Religious places and theatres, multiplexes and auditoriums will remain shut till further orders, the state government said.Public health minister Rajesh Tope announced more relaxations after the state Cabinet meeting on Wednesday.The new set of relaxations will be applicable even to the 11 districts that have comparatively more daily Covid-19 cases and a higher test positivity rate. Test positivity rate is the number of test returning positive out of the total tests conducted for an infection.These districts were exempted from the relaxations announced earlier this month. The positivity and growth rate in these districts have now come down, as per the presentation made to the state Cabinet on Wednesday.The health minister said that the relaxations come with a rider in the wake of the potential third wave of the virus. The state Cabinet has put the threshold of requirement of the oxygen to treat Covid-19 patients. “If the daily requirement of the Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) reaches 700 MT, strict lockdown will be imposed immediately. Maharashtra’s LMO generation per day is 1,300MT, which is expected to go up to 2,000 MT in next few days because of the augmentation measures taken by us. As per the Centre’s direction, the state government should augment the oxygen capacity to 1.5 times the requirement at the peak of the second wave. As per that parameter, the requirement would be 3,800MT, against our generation of 2,000MT. Since the possibility of supply of the LMO from other states is less if the third wave strikes, we have decided to strictly impose the lockdown again if the requirement goes up,” Tope said.Maharashtra reported 5,560 new Covid-19 cases and 163 fresh deaths on Wednesday, taking the tally to 6,369,002 cases and toll to 13,464.

Minutes after the launch, the satellite was said to have successfully completed its second stage, following which it commenced cryogenic operations in the third phase.However, Isro chairman K Sivan said moments later that the mission could not be completed successfully. "There was an anomaly observed in the cryogenic stage. Isro's GSLV-F10/EOS-03 mission could not be fully accomplished," Sivan was heard saying during the live telecast of the launch.Researchers directing the mission were not receiving performance data from the cryogenic engine, officials familiar with the matter said.Isro said earlier that the Earth observation satellite was to be placed by the launch vehicle in the Geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO), a highly elliptic geocentric orbit that almost always serves as an intermediate step for satellites before reaching for their final orbit. After that, the satellite was expected to make its way to the final geostationary orbit with the help of an onboard propulsion system.This time, the space agency even made some changes to the fairing capsule used in its satellite. Isro said that in a first, it sent an Ogive-shaped payload measuring a diameter of 4 metres.The GISAT-1 satellite intended to obtain spectral signatures for agriculture, forestry, mineralogy, cloud properties, snow and glaciers, and oceanography, enabling researchers back home to gain new insight on a host of issues. On the basis of these photographs, India was expected to be able to monitor and respond to natural disasters and any other short-term events at an alarming pace, according to officials of the space agency familiar with the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isros-eye-in-the-sky-satellite-blasts-off-but-fails-to-reach-orbit-101628728013585.html

The day was designated as International Youth Day by the United Nations in the year 1999 after the General Assembly endorsed the recommendation by the 'World Conference of Ministers Responsible for Youth.' Subsequently, it is being celebrated every year to highlight the importance of youth people as the driving force of change in the world.To observe the day, various activities like concerts, workshops, cultural events, and meetings are organised by schools and other educational institutions to engage the youth and in order to bring their voices, actions, and initiatives to the mainstream.International Youth Day 2021 themeThe day is marked with a theme every year as per its relevance to the times. This year's theme is "Transforming Food Systems: Youth Innovation for Human and Planetary Health." It was chosen by the United Nations after these issues were highlighted at ECOSOC Youth Forum (EYF) 2021.The UN will commemorate the day virtually, due to the coronavirus pandemic, in partnership with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the world body and the major group for children and youth. "Through youth education, engagement, innovation, and entrepreneurial solutions, this year’s International Youth Day aims to provide a platform for young people to continue the momentum from the EYF in the lead up to the high-level Food Systems Summit," the world body said on its website.An online webinar is also being organised to explore the role that youth play to achieve more equitable and sustainable food systems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/international-youth-day-why-is-it-celebrated-101628725944089.html
12-08-2021||India||Himachal Pradesh: Hills creak under climate crisis, construction||The landslide that struck a national highway in Himachal Pradesh’s Kinnaur district has brought back focus on the delicate ecology of the region, which has been weakened further by the human-induced climate crisis and unchecked construction of power projects, experts say.These factors together raise the possibility of landslides and floods, which loom as a threat in addition to the seismological features that predispose the region to earthquakes, which can further trigger big landslides.Manshi Asher of Himdhara Collective, an environment group based in Himachal, summarised these as three factors that made the region vulnerable to disasters: fragile ecology, climate change and unplanned development.“Kinnaur, located in greater Himalayas, is inheritably fragile. Due to a lot of tectonic movement the region is highly sensitive seismically and geologically,” said Asher.The climate crisis, she added, has aggravated the problem. “Global warming has resulted in a change in rainfall pattern. Areas like Kinnaur which used to get less rains, have been witnessing high rainfall now”.“And the last and most vital issue is haphazard construction taking place in these mountains,” she said, citing large hydropower projects that have come up or are planned in Kinnaur, at present inhabitant mostly by mountain tribes. The tunnelling, excavation and blasting work being done to build these dams threatens an already fragile landscape, Asher added.A study carried out in Kinnaur between 2012 and 2016 found that a push for hydropower projects in the name of clean energy brought rapid land-use changes that adversely impacting local terrestrial ecosystems and communities inhabiting them.It found that of the area of forest land diverted to non-forest activities between 1980 and 2014, 90% was transferred for hydro-electric projects and transmission lines, leading to fragmentation of forests and loss of biodiversity in the Kinnaur region.Asher said Nigulsari is in close proximity to one of the largest hydropower project in the state – the Nathpa Jhakri.Ambrish Kumar Mahajan, professor at the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Central University of Himachal Pradesh, agreed with Asher’s assessment. “Kinnaur is fragile due to the highly jointed and fractured geology,” he said.Then, there are steep slopes and a lot of development activities along it. “Clubbed together, these factors have made Kinnaur a hub of landslide disasters,” he said. He added the risk extended to Himachal Pradesh as a whole, and this has been borne out in several instances.In addition to the warnings, some of the red flags came from within assessments by the government’s own departments. The environment department of Himachal Pradesh government, in its State Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan in 2012, warned that floods, landslides, glacial lake bursts, excess rainfall, excess snowfall and unseasonal rains will pose a threat.It said the state could experience a difference of 1-5 degrees C in minimum temperature and 0.5-2.5 degrees C in maximum temperature by 2030.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/himachal-pradesh-hills-creak-under-climate-crisis-construction-101628726630891.html

12-08-2021||India||India needs to talk about 2nd-gen steps against poverty||There are no official statistics on the number of poor in India after 2011-12. The Consumption Expenditure Survey (CES) of 2017-18, which would have given the latest numbers on poverty, was scrapped by the government. Leaked findings of the 2017-18 CES showed a fall in average monthly per capita expenditure (MPCE) for the first time and triggered a political storm. Logically speaking, poverty should have increased with a fall in average MPCE in the 2017-18 CES.While the controversy around the scraping of 2017-18 CES led to polarisation, with the government and its supporters dismissing fears of a rise in poverty, the pandemic’s shock has made such differences redundant.Since the Indian economy has suffered its highest ever contraction of 7.3% in 2020-21 and the post-pandemic recovery is biased in favour of profits (in the wage-profit binary) and the formal sector (in the formal-informal binary), an increase in poverty is almost certain now. The fact that the government has been extending the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojna (PMGKY) – it offers 5kg wheat or rice and 1kg preferred pulses for free to 800 million people – speaks volumes about the kind of kind of economic precarity that affects most Indians at the moment.India’s largest ever economic contraction in 2020-21, followed by the second Covid wave’s disruption to the sequential economic recovery, has made restoration of growth the focal point of economic commentary at the moment. While growth is a necessary condition for poverty reduction, it is not a sufficient condition, as the post-pandemic economy can put itself in a trajectory with higher levels of inequality, and therefore poverty.The situation calls for reopening the debate on anti-poverty programmes, which were popular at the time when the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) assumed office in 2004. Whether or not such programmes are adopted, is not, as is often believed, merely a function of the fiscal headroom available to a government. There are deeper political economy processes at play behind such decisions. Here are five charts which put this in perspective.The difference between asset-generating programmes and anti-poverty programmesWhether or not a person is poor is not a function of their asset endowments, but income. India calculates its poverty by deciding on an MPCE level below which a person is deemed to be poor. This also means one-time asset generating programmes -- the mainstay of the current government’s welfare push -- are not anti-poverty programmes. The government could have given money to a household to build a toilet or even a house, and it could provide LPG cylinders and piped water supply to their houses, but none of these guarantee that the household in question will continue to earn enough to stay above the designated poverty line.The only income enhancement programme that the Narendra Modi government has started is the PM-KISAN scheme, which offers ₹6,000 a year to farmers. Other examples of anti-poverty programmes would be Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and the Public Distribution System (PDS), or the PMGKY, which was discussed above.PDS and MGNREGS have been game changers in the fight against povertyFood items have a 39% share in India’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket. Cereals alone have a share of almost 10%. This one statistic makes it clear why the subsidised provisioning of rice and wheat through PDS matters in fighting poverty in India. India’s PDS in its current avatar offers almost free food to at least two-thirds of the population.Interestingly, PDS first contracted and then expanded in scope during the post-reform period in India. This is because the universal PDS was first made into a targeted PDS in 1997. Its scope was first expanded under the Atal Bihari Bajpayee government, which launched the Antyodaya Anna Yojna in 2000, reducing issue price of cereals to the really poor. A 2013 EPW paper by Himanshu and Abhijit Sen shows how PDS’s reach first fell and then expanded during the reform period. The National Food Security Act (NFSA) of 2013 further expanded the reach of PDS in India. The expansion in coverage was especially high among poorer households.MGNREGS is essentially a counter-cylical demand driven cushion for unskilled workers in rural areas. Wages under it are generally lower than market wages, and payments are often delayed. Despite this, MGNREGS has been a game-changer in India’s rural political-economy landscape. This is because, the unskilled rural workforce, the most vulnerable among India’s workers, now has a backup while bargaining for wages in the open market. In other words, the rural employer cannot wield the threat of work or starve ( PDS has helped here as well) to the rural labourer. This is best seen from the fact that rural wages have increased in the post-MGNREGS phase in India.The political fallout of anti-poverty programmes can be counter-intuitiveAt the macro-level, fall in poverty is good news. As income levels increase, so does demand, boosting future growth, kick-starting a virtuous cycle. However,a fall in poverty -- especially rise in bargaining power of the poor -- need not be a welcome development for all stakeholders in an economy. Consider rural landowners. With MGNREGS and PDS providing an important income cushion to the rural proletariat, the bargaining power of the have-nots went up, putting a squeeze on incomes of the propertied classes. This can be seen in an increase in the share of cost on account of casual workers (hired workers) in the value of output of crops such as rice and wheat in the years following the roll-out of MGNREGS.While the anger of the rural rich is unlikely to have been the biggest factor behind the BJP’s 2014 victory, it was not an insignificant factor. An analysis of vote shares of the Congress and the BJP by class in the 2009 and 2014 Lok Sabha elections makes this clear. The Congress’s losses and the BJP’s gains held across class divide, but they were the biggest among the rich and the smallest among the poor.When seen in this context, the BJP’s preference for asset-transfer based welfare programmes rather than income-enhancement schemes appears to be a conscious strategy to not tilt the tables against the propertied classes, especially in rural areas, any further. Even the PM-KISAN scheme is class agnostic because it does not differentiate between rich and poor farmers, and excludes the poorest, i.e. the rural landless.This strategy may have been alright, had the economy not entered a slowdown followed by a contraction. But, at the current moment, when a rise in inequality and poverty threatens to damage India’s long-term growth prospects, it will not help. Any economic strategy to counter these will have to navigate the waters of not just fiscal ability , but also the potential backlash from the BJP’s support-base among the relatively privileged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-needs-to-talk-about-2nd-gen-steps-against-poverty-101628722578591.html
12-08-2021||India||SC grants bail to former Karnataka minister, keeps him out of Dharwad||The Supreme Court on Wednesday granted bail to former Karnataka minister and Congress leader Vinay Kulkarni in an alleged murder case committed in 2016 and directed him to remain out of Dharwad as one of the bail conditions, flouting which will result in cancellation of his bail.Kulkarni had approached the top court for bail after he was arrested in November 2020 in connection with the murder of a BJP Zilla Panchayat leader Yogeshgouda Goudar in June 2016.The politically sensitive case was initially probed by the Karnataka Police which filed a charge sheet claiming that the murder was committed due to a property dispute. The said charge sheet named six persons as accused. Kulkarni was not named in the charge sheet. In 2019, after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in the state, Yogesh’s family requested for a probe by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which was acceded to by the state government.After taking over the probe, CBI roped in Kulkarni as one of the accused along with several other persons and filed supplementary chargesheets alleging that the murder was a result of a political rivalry that brewed ever since Yogesh defeated his Congress rival in the Zilla Panchayat polls in Dharwad district.The bench of Justices UU Lalit and Ajay Rastogi on Wednesday put Kulkarni to strict terms while allowing his plea for bail. The court directed the prosecution to present Kulkarni before the trial court in the next three days where conditions for his bail shall be imposed. The top court said, “The appellant shall not enter Dharwad and will mark his presence twice a week before the officer concerned at Anti Corruption Bureau, CBI at Bengaluru.” This will be in addition to the conditions that the accused shall not impede the proceedings of the trial, pending investigation or in any manner, directly or indirectly, influence witnesses or tamper evidence. Any violation of these conditions would result in cancellation of bail, the bench added.The petition filed by Kulkarni was taken up along with appeals filed by CBI and Karnataka government challenging an order passed by the Karnataka high court in November 2019 staying further investigation in the case by CBI. The top court had issued notice on CBI appeal on February 20, 2020 and stayed the high court order.On Wednesday, the top court allowed the stay to continue and directed the Chief Justice of Karnataka HC to assign the matter to a two-judge bench, if rules so permit, considering the important issues in the matter. CBI had requested the top court that the matter should not be sent to the same bench that earlier dealt with the matter. The court directed the HC to take up the cases preferably within two months.The bench clarified, “The grant of bail to the appellant shall not be construed as a discussion on merits of the case.” Moreover, it was noted that the appeals were filed against an interim order passed by the Karnataka HC which was yet to examine the merits of the petitions filed by the accused.Already, the trial court has taken cognizance of the charge sheets filed by CBI and this was one ground for the court to consider granting bail to Kulkarni. Appearing for the Congress leader, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi stated that the investigation by CBI was meant to serve political ends and it could not start a fresh investigation on its own. Even further investigation in the case required permission of the Magistrate under Section 173(8) of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), he argued.The CBI, represented by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju stated that there was telltale evidence to show Kulkarni’s role at each step of the conspiracy leading to the murder. He said that the CBI was authorized to take up further investigation in the case as crucial evidence in the form of CCTV footage had been missed out by the local police in its investigation.The CBI took over the investigation of the case in September 2019 and has since filed two charge sheets in May 2020 and February 2021. Since his arrest in the case on November 5 last year, Kulkarni is lodged at Hindalga Central Jail in Belagavi situated in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-grants-bail-to-former-karnataka-minister-keeps-him-out-of-dharwad-101628714671348.html
12-08-2021||India||Shocked over Unveiling of Shiva Idol, says HC, asks B’luru top cop to probe||Bengaluru: The Karnataka high court on Wednesday directed Bengaluru police commissioner to personally inspect the alleged illegal statue of Shiva constructed on an artificial island inside Begur lake in Bengaluru. The court reiterated that the construction of an artificial island and the installation of a Shiva statue inside Begur lake is not a religious issue but a legal one. A division bench of Chief Justice Abhay Oka and Justice M Nagaprasanna in its order termed the unveiling of the statue as a ‘shocking incident’. “A shocking incident of unveiling Shiva Idol installed by BBMP on Begur lake island has been brought to the notice of this court. Our attention is invited to the interim orders dated August 30, 2019, September 17, 2019, and February 22, 2021, which in no uncertain terms prohibit the said activity.” The controversial statue was constructed on an artificial island, which was created by encroaching Begur lake. Though the construction inside Begur lake was stopped through a stay order by the Karnataka high court nearly two years ago in August 2019, the court was informed on August 8 by the petitioner Leo Saldanha that the Shiva statue which was under wraps was unveiled and saffron flags were installed in preparation for its consecration. The counsel appearing for the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) in court said that the statue was covered on Wednesday morning at 11:45 am by officials with police protection. However, despite the HC order, on Wednesday evening some Hindutva activists removed the covers of the statue once again. “We direct the AGA (full form) to forward a copy of the memo along with annexures to the Commissioner of Police, Bengaluru, who will personally look into the matter and initiate action in accordance with the law,” the order added. “Openly in daylight, orders of the court are defied by making an appeal, the state must act on its own.” Further, the court in its order said, “BBMP says status quo ante has been restored today by again covering the statute and by removing the flags on the island. If anyone is aggrieved by the orders passed by this court, he has statutory remedies available,” said the order. During the hearing on Wednesday morning, the state had informed the court that appropriate action will be taken against those violating the order. However, officials in the police confirmed to HT that no one has been booked for the unveiling the statue on Wednesday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shocked-over-unveiling-of-shiva-idol-says-hc-asks-b-luru-top-cop-to-probe-101628714491336.html
12-08-2021||India||The curious case of an ATS in K’taka; no case, no investigation||Bengaluru: Sixteen years after the first terror attack on the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), the first terrorist attack in Bengaluru, Karnataka now has three different anti-terrorism squads with the third being added last year. Even though Bengaluru has witnessed three major terror attacks since the IISc attack on December 28, 2005, one of the ATS units has a peculiar track record of not being part of any of the terror-related investigations. At present Karnataka Police operates three the Anti-Terror Squads (ATS) and it come under three different departments within the police force -- the Internal Security Division, State Intelligence Department and the Central Crime Branch. The third ATS unit under Central Crime Branch was added last year. . The ATS which comes under the Internal Security Division -- has a unique track record. The unit has neither registered a single FIR nor has it investigated any terror case since its formation in 2009 following the 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai. Similar units were raised by the Maharashtra and New Delhi Police as well. Like their counterparts, ATS had the mandate of being the state police’s nodal agency for all counter-terror operations in the state. However, unlike Mumbai and New Delhi, ATS was not given any powers to register FIRs and investigate terror-related cases in Karnataka, officials, requesting anonymity said. Since the formation of the ATS under the Internal Security Division, Bengaluru witnessed three major terror strikes – the 2010 Chinnaswamy stadium blast, the 2013 BJP headquarters blast and the 2014 Church Street blast. Even though ATS was the nodal agency for counter-terrorism, all three cases were investigated by the local police or Central Crime Branch. According to the records of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), 15 people have been arrested in Karnataka since 2014 for their alleged connection with Islamic State (IS) agents. The state intelligence records show that 30 people have been arrested so far in the state, for radicalisation and having links with members of the IS. The arrest of Mehdi Masroor Biswas, an engineer who allegedly ran a pro-Islamic State Twitter handle, in 2014, has been one of the biggest catches for the Bengaluru police. In its charge sheet, the police claimed that Biswas would monitor the developments of IS on the internet and television and assist his followers, who were willing to enter the IS territory. Even in these cases, the investigations were carried out by local police and Central Crime Branch. Two officers who served in the ISD’s ATS referred to the unit as a paper tiger. According to one officer, the job of the ATS, despite being the nodal agency for counter-terrorism, was to collect memos from central agencies and pass them to relevant units. “In my time in the unit, we have not done any investigation or any serious intelligence collection for that matter. We took inputs from different units and send them across. This job was done by the intelligence department also,” said one of the officers, who didn’t want to disclose his identity. The second officer said that a posting in the unit could be perceived as a “punishment” or “soft posting”, depending on the officer. “How can ATS be a nodal agency, when the officers from different ATS units go directly to Bengaluru police or the CCB for inputs? This unit is certainly not doing the job its counterparts are doing,” said the officer who had worked briefly in the unit. Karnataka police chief, DG&IGP Praveen Sood said that even though the state has three different ATS units their roles are well defined. “Last year we have started the ATS in the Bengaluru police since the city had witnessed multiple terror attacks in the past. This unit comes under the Central Crime Branch (CCB). For the other two agencies, their role is to provide intelligence and inputs. ATS (ISD) liaisons with NIA and IB (Intelligence Bureau),” said Sood. Despite the police chief’s claim that the roles are well-defined, officers in the ISD’s ATS are still unclear about their role, as the intelligence on counter-terrorism is handled by state intelligence and investigations are handled by either Central Crime Branch or local police. On Tuesday, newly appointed Karnataka home minister Araga Jnanendra told the top brass of the department to give more powers to the ISD. An officer who was part of the meeting however said that apart from the single instruction, no detailed propositions were made by the home minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-curious-case-of-an-ats-in-k-taka-no-case-no-investigation-101628714433497.html
12-08-2021||India||Twitter handles of senior Congress leaders locked temporarily||The Congress on Wednesday said Twitter accounts of four of its leaders were temporarily locked, a development that came on a day the social media company confirmed in the Delhi high court that it locked the account of Rahul Gandhi for breaching its policy.Late on Wednesday, the Congress said the accounts of Randeep Surjewala, Ajay Maken, Sushmita Dev and Manickam Tagore were “temporarily locked”. There was no immediate confirmation from Twitter on the development.While Surjewala is the chief spokesperson of the Congress, Maken is the party’s general secretary incharge of Rajasthan. Dev handles the Mahila Congress and Tagore is a Lok Sabha MP of the party.Earlier in the day, the firm informed the Delhi high court that it “locked” Gandhi’s account because of his August 4 tweet which posted photographs of family members of a minor who was allegedly raped and murdered in the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-twitter-handles-of-senior-leaders-including-randeep-surjewala-locked-temporarily-101628714012360.html

In a 82-second video that went viral on social media, a group of Kranti Sena members are purportedly seen visiting markets and asking shopkeepers not to allow Muslims to apply henna on the hands of Hindu women. Later, in the same video, some members of the organisation are seen claiming that they had issued the diktat in this regard. When asked about the repercussions if someone violated the diktat, a member in the video is heard saying: “We would tackle it in our own way.” HT could not verify the authenticity of the video.Reacting to the clipping, Muzaffarnagar police said patrolling was being carried out in markets and stern action would be initiated against those trying to disrupt the peace and harmony in the region.HT tried to contact senior superintendent of police (Muzaffarnagar) Abhishek Yadav but did not get a response immediately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cant-let-muslims-apply-henna-on-hindu-women-right-wing-organisation-101628713592275.html
12-08-2021||India||India already recording events IPCC warned of||India has already started witnessing what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) flagged in its “Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis” report on Monday — so-called compound extreme events, including severe cyclonic storms, floods and heatwaves.In May, extremely severe cyclonic storm Tauktae intensified rapidly and unexpectedly, clocking wind speeds of 180-190kmph gusting to 210kmph, and resulting in intense spells of rain in Mumbai.It was a combination of two extreme events — over the ocean Tauktae rapidly intensified from a “very severe cyclonic storm” to an “extremely severe cyclonic storm” within a few hours on the morning of May 17 while over land, torrential rains inundated and crippled the country’s financial capital, shutting down even the city’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport.Such compound or cascading extreme events are expected to be more frequent and may have a high impact in coming years, IPCC warned.Compound extreme events are a combination of multiple drivers or hazards that contribute to societal or environmental risk. Examples are concurrent heatwaves and droughts, compound flooding (a storm surge in combination with extreme rainfall and river flow), compound fire weather conditions (a combination of hot, dry, and windy conditions), or concurrent extremes at different locations.“The changing climate state is already altering the likelihood of extreme events, such as decadal droughts and extreme sea levels, and will continue to do so under future warming. Compound events and concurrent extremes contribute to increasing probability of low-likelihood, high-impact outcomes and will become more frequent with increasing global warming,” IPCC said in its report.Based on 14,000 scientific papers studied by 234 experts, the IPCC report said the world will miss its target of keeping global warming to under 1.5 degrees C over pre-industrial levels, and that this will be exceeded in the next two decades, resulting in a higher frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Attributing the heating almost exclusively to human activity, it also called for immediate action, including a move away from fossil fuels, if the world wants to keep global warming to under 2 degrees C.A projection by the panel that may be particularly relevant to India is that the compound effects of climate change, land subsidence and human factors may lead to higher flood levels and prolonged inundation in Mekong Delta and other Asian coasts. An increasing sea level compounded by increasing tropical cyclone storms and rainfall intensity may further increase the probability of coastal city flooding.“These events are already happening. This is basically one extreme event triggering another or two or more extreme events taking place at the same time. The impact of such events is very high. For example, there can be extreme precipitation and extreme flooding at the same time. Or there is extreme heat leading to heat waves which then triggers wildfires that can make management of disasters very complicated. Another example is of tropical cyclones and extreme rainfall happening together. We can expect such multiple or cascading events taking place together more frequently when there is 1.5 degree C warming,” said R Krishnan, executive director, Centre for Climate Change Research at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and one of the authors of the IPCC report.The report also said that extreme rain and winds can result in infrastructure damage; the compounding of storm surge and rain extremes can cause coastal floods; the combination of drought and heat can lead to tree mortality; and wildfires can increase occurrences of hailstorms and lightning.Compound storm types comprising co-located cyclone and thunderstorm systems can cause extreme rainfall and extreme winds than individual storm types, IPCC said, adding that studies also show an increasing risk for breadbasket regions to be concurrently affected by climate extremes with increasing global warming, even between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming.India’s 7,516- km-long coastline is particularly vulnerable to compound events, the IPCC report said. “It’s very simple, the Indian Ocean is warming at a higher rate compared to the global average. This is often leading to tropical cyclones intensifying very rapidly. Along with that, we have sea level rise in coastal areas. We are also seeing higher storm surge and strong winds. All of this is coming together with extreme rainfall. Extreme rainfall events are rising at the rate of 7% with every 1 degree C of warming. These are compound events and not singular events. We saw a similar pattern for Amphan, Tauktae and Yaas and this will only become more frequent in future,” said Subimal Ghosh, Institute Chair Professor, Department of Civil Engineering, IIT, Mumbai and another author of the IPCC report.Krishnan said early warning systems have improved significantly since the 1999 Odisha super cyclone but more accuracy is needed in forecasting the intensity of cyclones. “We need widespread awareness of climate change-related disasters and training in climate change, oceanography and meteorology should start very early from high school,” he added.“Chances of multiple extreme events overlapping to form compound events are high for coastal cities. The strong winds from the cyclones drive huge waves at 5m or high, pushing water onto the coast and flooding the region. This flood is amplified by the rains from the cyclone. Increasing sea level along the coast is taking this flood level up every year. Sometimes a high-tide can aggravate the flood, taking it several kilometers inland. We already saw these kinds of compound events with Cyclone Tauktae and Yaas this year. While the IPCC report discusses these events and we see them happening, we have not quantified them yet,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, climate scientist, IITM, Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-already-recording-events-ipcc-warned-of-101628712633213.html
12-08-2021||India||Kinnaur disaster highlights climate change, unscientific development risks||The landslide that struck a national highway in Himachal Pradesh’s Kinnaur district has brought back focus on the delicate ecology of the region, which has been weakened further by human-induced climate change and unchecked construction of power projects, experts say.These factors together raise the possibility of landslides and floods, which loom as a threat in addition to the seismological features that predispose the region to earthquakes, which can further trigger big landslides.Manshi Asher of Himdhara Collective, an environment group based in Himachal, summarised these as three factors that made the region vulnerable to disasters: fragile ecology, climate change and unplanned development. “Kinnaur, located in greater Himalayas, is inheritably fragile. Due to a lot of tectonic movement the region is highly sensitive seismically and geologically,” said Asher. Climate change, she added, has further aggravated the problem. “Global warming has resulted in a change in rainfall pattern. Areas like Kinnaur which used to get less rains, have been witnessing high rainfall now”. “And the last and most vital issue is haphazard construction taking place in these mountains,” she said, citing large hydropower projects that have come up or are planned in Kinnaur, at present inhabitant mostly by mountain tribes. The tunnelling, excavation and blasting work being done to build these dams threatens an already fragile landscape, Asher added. A study carried out in Kinnaur between 2012 and 2016 found that a push for hydropower projects in the name of clean energy brought rapid land-use changes that adversely impacting local terrestrial ecosystems and communities inhabiting them.It found that of the area of forest land diverted to non-forest activities between 1980 and 2014, 90% was transferred for hydro-electric projects and transmission lines, leading to fragmentation of forests and loss of biodiversity in the Kinnaur region. Asher said Nigulsari is in close proximity to one of the largest hydropower project in the state – the Nathpa Jhakri. Ambrish Kumar Mahajan, professor at the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Central University of Himachal Pradesh, agreed with Asher’s assessment. “Kinnaur is fragile due to the highly jointed and fractured geology,” he said. Then, there are steep slopes and a lot of development activities along it. “Clubbed together, these factors have made Kinnaur a hub of landslide disasters,” he said. He said the risk extended to Himachal Pradesh as a whole, and this has been borne out in several instances. In addition to the warnings, some of the red flags came from within assessments by the government’s own departments. The environment department of Himachal Pradesh government, in its State Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan in 2012, warned that floods, landslides, glacial lake bursts, excess rainfall, excess snowfall and unseasonal rains will pose a threat. It said the state could experience a difference of 1-5 degrees C in minimum temperature and 0.5-2.5 degrees C in maximum temperature by 2030.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kinnaur-disaster-highlights-climate-change-unscientific-development-risks-101628712331817.html

Among the two accused is the girl’s father and a self-proclaimed godman, police said on Wednesday.The two allegedly strangled the girl to death and threw her body in the Singlo river to “cure” some unknown ailment that the godman, identified as Bogadhar Munda, dreamt he was suffering from, according to police.“Both accused have confessed their involvement in the murder. Preliminary investigation reveals that Bogadhar claimed to have dreamt that he had some illness, which could be cured only with the sacrifice of a child. He disclosed this to the victim’s father who decided to help him by offering his own child for the sacrificial ritual,” said Sudhakar Singh, superintendent of police, Charaideo district.The victim’s father Anta Munda (54) and Bogadhar, also in his 50s, are workers in the Safrai tea garden in the area.Both are believed to be very close to each other, and the victim’s father used to work as a part-time help in the Bogadhar’s house.Police said they were first informed about the incident on Monday by the girl’s sister.“We were informed on Monday by the victim’s eldest sister -- who is married and lives separately -- that the four-year-old girl, who was sleeping with two other siblings and their grandmother, was abducted by some unknown persons,” Singh said.A search operation was launched and on Tuesday the victim’s body was found in a nearby river. The police team also found the child’s clothes and some other items associated with religious rituals from the bank of the river.“The recovery of the body and other items led us to suspect that it could be a case of witchcraft or human sacrifice. Our teams questioned several people, and Anta and Bogadhar were arrested on Wednesday for their involvement in the child’s murder,” Singh said on Wednesday..The body of the child, which bore strangulation marks, has been sent for a post mortem and its report is awaited. Further investigation is underway and more people could be arrested, said police, adding that the murder weapon is yet to be traced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4yrold-girl-killed-in-ritual-to-cure-illness-say-assam-police-101628711168176.html
12-08-2021||India||Bharat Biotech re-adapts plant to raise production||Indian biotechnology company Bharat Biotech has repurposed its Chiron Behring manufacturing plant in Ankleshwar, Gujarat, to scale up production of its anti-Covid vaccine, Covaxin, said people familiar with the development.The Chiron Behring facility was established in the 1980s to manufacture anti-rabies vaccines. In 2019, Bharat Biotech acquired it from pharmaceutical major Glaxo Smithkline.“The decision to manufacture Covaxin at Ankleshwar, Gujarat, was taken several months ago with planning and preparatory activities. Facility preparations and production activities began in June. Vaccines will be available for supply in September,” said a person familiar with the matter on condition of anonymity.On Tuesday, the Centre had announced its approval of Bharat Biotech’s manufacturing facility at Ankleshwar to produce Covaxin.“Govt of India approves vaccine manufacturing facility for production of @BharatBiotech’s #Covaxin in Ankleshwar, Gujarat. Following PM @NarendraModi ji’s vision of #SabkoVaccineMuftVaccine, this will increase vaccine availability & accelerate the world’s largest vaccine drive,” Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya had tweeted.Close to six million doses are likely to be produced in this plant every month, which will push up the production of Covaxin close to 60 million doses a month around the last quarter of this year.Currently, doses from Bharat Biotech’s Hyderabad facility are being supplied for the country’s Covid-19 immunisation programme. Apart from the Gujarat facility, Bharat Biotech has also refurbished its Malur plant in Karnataka to produce Covaxin doses to scale up production.With a couple of other public sector undertakings also being roped in for manufacturing Covaxin doses, the production number of Covaxin is projected to increase from the current 25 million doses a month to at least 58 million doses, according to the government.According to Bharat Biotech, each batch of Covaxin undergoes over 200 quality control tests before being submitted to Central Drugs Laboratory for testing. The company has so far supplied at least 70 million doses for the national immunisation programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-readapts-plant-to-raise-production-101628708854839.html
12-08-2021||India||Plea seeking aid for treatment: Get lung machines in all districts, says SC||The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Centre to consider the possibility of arranging a lung support machine called ECMO in every district as it came across a petition filed by a woman seeking financial assistance for her husband whose lungs were completely damaged due to Covid-19 in May.Married for a little over a year, the woman, Sheela Mehra (31), from Madhya Pradesh had approached the top court in July with the request for ₹1 crore assistance from the PM Cares Fund, PM Relief Fund or Chief Minister Relief Fund to save her ailing husband, Manish Kumar Gohiya . Since July 7, he has been on ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) support at Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Secunderabad, which requires a daily expense of close to ₹1.5 lakh.The man was earlier admitted to All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhopal, on May 14. From there, he was flown to Telangana in an air ambulanceon June 2 and admitted to Yashoda Hospital in Hyderabad before being shifted to KIMS hospital that had the ECMO facility.The woman has already spent close to ₹1 crore on his medical expenses and had outstanding dues of ₹10 lakh towards the hospital. She exhausted all her savings and property too and needed another ₹55 lakh for a lung transplant. The ECMO machine has allowed her husband to stay alive and he would need its support until the surgery.Last week, a bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose had issued a notice to the Centre on humanitarian grounds while making it clear that the petitioner had no legal right to claim monetary assistance. On Wednesday, solicitor general Tushar Mehta appeared for the Centre and informed the court that the petitioner had been allocated ₹3 lakh from the PM Cares Fund, and altogether ₹5 lakh was approved for payment to the hospital fromcentral funds. “How is it going to help? She is already incurring close to ₹1.5 lakh per day for the ECMO machine. Why can’t the Centre consider having ECMO machines at the district level?” the bench said.Mehta said this suggestion could be considered. “I will personally take it up with the health minister,” he said.The petitioner, represented by advocate Mukesh Kumar, submitted to the court that the question ultimately was to save a human life and this was a classic case where a woman had gone much beyond her means to save her husband.Last week, while issuing the notice, the court had indicated the danger of entertaining such pleas. “Our sympathies are with you but the remedy you are resorting to is not correct. Imagine in this vast country, there will be thousands of people asking us to consider paying the medical expenses for their loved ones that can extend even beyond ₹1 crore,” the court had said.As a last resort, the bench asked the petitioner to check with KIMS hospital to find out if any charitable trust could sponsor the treatment. The bench said it was aware of some private hospitals in Telangana that have tie-ups with charitable trusts that help people who are not financially well off.The court posted the matter for further hearing on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-seeking-aid-for-treatment-get-lung-machines-in-all-districts-says-sc-101628708671969.html
12-08-2021||India||TN FM bats for streamlining of distribution of subsidies||Tamil Nadu is likely to tighten the screws on state expenditure with finance minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan advocating urgent course correction in rolling out subsidies, pushing for making them more targeted rather than universal. The revised budget, to be presented on Friday, is expected to demonstrate the way on how these profound reforms are to be carried out.The subsidies have been a major part of Tamil Nadu’s expenditure due to the welfare politics of the state. The idea for reformation to reorient subsidies only to the poor digresses from welfare schemes to all. He Rajan cited the case of cash doles and 100 free units of electricity, which is meant to support have-nots also reaching the haves and that it is being misused.Going by the trends in expenditure, according to the White Paper on the state’s finances that Rajan released on Monday, development expenditure of Tamil Nadu has been declining while expenditure in subsidies has rapidly increased. “There is strong evidence of inefficiency in the delivery of subsidies, with a considerable portion being misdirected or diverted,” Rajan had said after releasing the white paper. He batted for developing targeted and cost-effective alternative means of delivering the intended financial assistance to stakeholders. This is to be done in a way without compromising on the delivery of essential commodities and services to vulnerable sections but the jury is out on how this can be executed. Subsidies that amounted to ₹4,841.8 crores in 2006-07 have risen to ₹62,338.8 crores in 2020-21. In other words, subsidies which accounted for 12.6% in 2006 have currently risen to 27% of the state’s total revenue expenditure. The remaining being used for salaries, operations, grant-in aids, pension and interest payments. Even if Covid-19 pandemic was considered, where several handouts were given due to the lockdown, subsidies reached 19.5% total expenditure in 2018-19, and the white paper says this is misgovernance. Power subsidy is the highest (at 1.10% GSDP) among all the other subsidies. This is a double whammy as the state government is also losing money on the power sector due to mounting losses of the electricity board (Tamil Nadu Electricity Board and Tamil Nadu Transmission Corporation). It’s followed by food subsidy (0.49% of GSDP) and transport subsidy (0.19% of GSDP).“The growth in the power subsidy is particularly alarming, and it currently represents more than 1% of GSDP,” the paper stated. And though Tamil Nadu provides rice free to all rice cardholders from 2011 through the Public Distribution System (PDS), a significant portion of the subsidy on rice is met through the National Food Security Act, 2013, and the state further subsidises it to provide free rice. The state also covers entirely to provide edible oil and Tur Dal at subsidised prices. The PDS system which is universal doesn’t exclude based on income criteria and distribution is done through more than 33,000 fair shops across the state. Out of the five different family cards in circulation in Tamil Nadu, rice cardholders are the highest at ₹2.07 crores. The new DMK government promised ₹4000 to every rice card holder on its first day after taking charge. This cash dole reached even the well to do, according to the finance minister. “A few are benefiting, and many are losing,” he said. “The system has been taken over by vested interests. The vested interests oppose the reforms and engage in propaganda to stop this reform.” When it’s for all it’s neither social justice nor economic prudence, he added. Currently, there is an absence of a mechanism to assess a ration card holder’s income, their tax slabs and those who are entitled. “That’s fundamentally an inefficient system,” says K E Raghunathan, convener, Consortium of Indian Association. “If that has been done, then the worry of misusing these funds is a negligible amount.”As a first step, if the state were to demarcate those below the poverty line and re-categorise the cards, rice hard holders will fall way below ₹2.07 crores. “We need to re-look at subsidies and remove those who are not entitled,” says political analyst Maalan Narayanan. “Define the target and decide on the process of transfer. This is the right time to do it because it’s a burden on the government but it requires political will, and the party may not take such bold decisions ahead of the local body polls.” The finance minister too had said that these reforms are his opinion, but he would abide by chief minister M K Stalin’s final call. But Raghunathan differs that when the state is facing a financial crisis, now may not be the right time to focus on this reform being suggested which is similar to Narendra Modi’s digitisation drive in 2014 to be transparent, and ensure government support reaches the right target. “I would call this minimum scale pilferages, and if we try and correct it now,” he says. “The numbers say this. Without considering last year, the average deficit is about ₹30,000 crores. These kinds of misuses maybe around ₹7000 crores. For that, you’re going to spend time and money just on data collection, which will be a penny-wise and pound-foolish exercise.”While subsidies are being argued, the drop in development expenditure in Tamil Nadu from 62.9% in 2011-12 to 57.5% in 2018-19 means the social insurances for the people of Tamil Nadu have fallen in terms of education, medical and public health, water supply and sanitation, housing and on economic services including agriculture, irrigation, industry and minerals, transport and communication.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-fm-bats-for-streamlining-of-distribution-of-subsidies-101628707592640.html
12-08-2021||India||Kerala reports 23.5k Covid cases, 116 deaths||Kerala on Wednesday reported 23,500 cases of Covid-19 with a test positivity rate of 14.49 per cent from the 162,130 samples tested, the state health ministry said, as medical experts criticized the Pinarayi Vijayan-led government for not treating the pandemic as a medical malady.The state also reported 116 death, taking the total fatalities to 18,120. Kerala has continued to take the lion’s share in the daily national Covid tally, reporting more than 60 per cent of the total 38,353 cases in the country. “The state government keeps experts and medical bodies in the dark and leaves everything to bureaucrats and political leadership,” said Dr S S Lal, who had a stint with the World Health Organisation. The Indian Medical Association Kerala chapter said medical experts were given a short shrift and the government often considers the medical malady a law and order problem. Four districts reported more than 2,500 cases. Thrissur has overtaken Malappuram (3,033) with 3,039 cases. Ernakulam (2,760) and Kozhikode (2,765) are two other districts with a high caseload. The ICU occupancy in the state has remained more or less unchanged at 2,100 and patients on ventilator support 790, health ministry statistics show. State health minister Veena George told the assembly that the government is doing everything possible to contain the pandemic. She said the government has no information about the presence of a new mutant variant in the state. “We hope cases will decline in coming week. But we have to be careful during Onam festival,” she said. As cases spike, what worries the state is the breakthrough and re-infections. It reported 40,000 breakthrough Covid infections, which means people contracting the disease after getting two doses of vaccine. The central team, which visited the state confirmed it in New Delhi on Wednesday. Now, these samples will undergo genome sequencing to rule out the possibility of a new variant. Though experts suspected a new variant behind the steady rise of cases, the Indian Council of Medical Research is yet to confirm it. The central team during its second visit found that in a high density of population, the prevalence of highly infectious Delta virus and laxity in-home quarantine are the main reasons for high caseload in the state. The state also has a high population of elderly people, and the prevalence of lifestyle diseases is also quite high, according to the medical records.With Onam just a week away, the experts fear festive occasions could mean large gatherings and celebrations – another triggering factor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-reports-23-5k-covid-cases-116-deaths-101628707591714.html
12-08-2021||India||Hyderabad doctor pledges 70% wealth in medical research||Global Hospitals group founder Ravindranath Kancherla, a doctor and philanthropist on Wednesday pledged ₹350 crores, 70% of his wealth, to build a not-for-profit medical education, research and innovation institute in the city. He has christened the project Global HealthTech University & Innovation Hub (GHUIH) . According to a statement, GHUIH will be a not-for-profit company with significant investment which will democratise medical care through health-tech innovation. It will help secure a leading place for Hyderabad and India on the global innovation map, the statement addedElaborating on the project, Dr Kancherla said, “GHUIH is being established in Hyderabad to provide a new model for sustainable development of medical infrastructure, which helps the global population by building infrastructure on a philanthropic model. It also contributes in reducing the load on the governments, reducing the cost of intervention through innovation thus striving towards providing health security for all.”“This institution is the first-of-its-kind in India, and there are very few across the world. I have pledged 70 per cent of my wealth for this cause and have appointed executors for my registered will to ensure the project goes on stream without any eventuality,” the 65-year-old gastroenterologist added.Work on the building is expected to commence by the end of this year.The medical university, which will include a 750-1,000 bed and a health-tech innovation hub, may need at least $100 million of capital over the next seven years towards medical technology infrastructure and human resources. While Dr Kancherla has pledged 70% his wealth to establish the Global Health Foundation, the remainder is expected to come from other philanthropists. Explaining the need for the project, Dr . Kancherla said, “According to a leading analyst firm report, the United States has 2.672 doctors per 1,000 people and 3.1 hospital beds per 1,000 people. As against this, India has a mere 0.599 doctors and 0.9 hospital beds per 1,000 people. Going by these numbers, India would need almost 2.4 million new doctors and over 2 million additional hospital beds to reach the global standards. To achieve world-class and affordable healthcare, the focus needs to be on talent creation through quality medical education by building a world-class medical university to train doctors, nurses, and technical staff in future technologies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-doctor-pledges-70-wealth-in-medical-research-101628707532332.html
12-08-2021||India||India to join Qatar meet on Afghanistan situation today||India is set to participate in a meeting of key countries being hosted by Qatar on Thursday to discuss the situation in Afghanistan against the backdrop of the Taliban’s massive offensive that has already resulted in the fall of nine provincial capitals. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that India will be represented at the meeting in Doha that will also be joined by nations such as Indonesia and Turkey, which is set to take over the security of Bagram airbase. There was no official word on the matter from the external affairs ministry and the people cited above were tight-lipped about the level of India’s participation. The invitation to join the meeting was extended by Mutlaq bin Majed Al-Qahtani, Qatar’s special envoy for counter-terrorism and conflict resolution, when he visited New Delhi last week. Qatar on Wednesday hosted a meeting of the “extended troika” that was convened by Russia and was joined by the US special envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, and his counterparts from Russia, China and Pakistan. On Tuesday, Qatar had hosted a meeting of representatives from China, the US, the UK, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, the UN and the European Union (EU) to assess the rapidly evolving situation in Afghanistan. The focus of these meetings has been reviving the stalled Afghan peace process amid the Taliban’s campaign of violence and attacks that has already resulted in the fall of nine provincial capitals in just five days – Sheberghan, Sari Pul, Aybak, Kunduz, Taluqan, Pul-e-Khumri, Farah, Zaranj and Faizabad. India has already said that any forcible takeover of Kabul will not be legitimate, and backed calls for a negotiated political settlement that preserves the gains under a democratic system over the past two decades and ensures the rights of minorities, women and ethnic groups. New Delhi also advised all Indian nationals in Afghanistan on Tuesday to make immediate arrangements to return home as it evacuated around 50 officials and security personnel from the consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif. According to figures provided by the government to Parliament last week, some 1,500 Indian nationals are currently in Afghanistan. During a meeting with Al-Qahtani’s visit in New Delhi on Saturday, external affairs minister S Jaishankar expressed concern at the rapid deterioration of the security situation in Afghanistan.

According to estimates by the Kashmiri Pandit Sangharsh Samiti (KPSS), of 75,343 Kashmiri Pandit families in January 1990, more than 70,000 fled till 1992.Responding to a question on the issue by the Shiv Sena’s Anil Desai, Union minister of state for home affairs, Nityanand Rai, said in Rajya Sabha: “Regarding restoration of properties to its rightful and original owner, nine properties have been restored, as per the information provided by the government of Jammu & Kashmir.”He said that under the J&K Migrant Immovable Property (Preservation, Protection & Restraint on Distress Sales) Act, 1997, district magistrates (DMs) in Jammu & Kashmir are the legal custodians of immovable properties of migrants, and take suo motu action on eviction proceedings in cases of encroachment. The migrants can also request the DMs for action, Rai addedThe minister said after the Article 370 move, 520 Kashmiri migrants returned to the Valley to take up jobs under the Prime Minister’s Development Package-2015.On August 5, 2019, the Centre effectively revoked Article 370, which bestowed special status to the erstwhile state, and Article 35A, which barred non-locals from buying or owning immovable property in Jammu & Kashmir, settling there permanently, or availing benefits of state-sponsored scholarship schemes. The constitutional provision acknowledged the special status of the (then) state of Jammu & Kashmir in terms of autonomy and its ability to formulate laws for the state’s permanent residents.On a separate question on whether domicile or permanent resident certificates are needed to buy non-agricultural land in Jammu & Kashmir, Rai said all provisions of the Constitution have been made applicable to the Union territory, which necessitated changes in existing laws in J&K.He said as per the adapted land laws of Jammu & Kashmir, the government may, by notification in the official gazette, allow transfer of land for public purposes such as education, health care and charitable purpose.On Tuesday, the home ministry told Parliament that only two people from outside J&K have brought properties in the UT since the laws were changed two years ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/9-properties-restored-to-hindus-in-j-k-since-article-370-move-govt-101628706813221.html
12-08-2021||India||Rajya Sabha chairman Naidu breaks down over ‘acts of sacrilege’ in House||In a rare display of emotion, Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu broke down on Wednesday, expressing “deep anguish” over “acts of sacrilege” by some MPs, a day after Opposition lawmakers protesting the contentious farm laws stormed the Well of the House, sat on a table there and threw a file at the Chair. The monsoon session of Parliament came to a premature end on Wednesday, with both Houses adjourned against the backdrop of a series of loud and disruptive protests by the Opposition seeking a discussion on the Pegasus snooping controversy, three contentious farm laws passed late last year, and the fuel price rise. A visibly upset Naidu didn’t deliver his customary valedictory address -- the first time this is happening in the 11 sessions he has chaired. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla too, was “pained” at the way the monsoon session proceeded . “I share people’s pain that their issues could not be discussed. Bills should be passed in the house after proper and productive discussions. And parliamentary traditions and sanctity of the institution need to be respected,” he added. Naidu’s reaction seems to have been prompted largely by Tuesday’s happenings. “ Parliament, the apex legislature of our country is regarded as the temple of democracy. The Table area where the officers, the Secretary General and the Presiding Officer are seated is considered the holy sanctum sanctorum of the House. A certain degree of sacredness is attached to this place,” Naidu said. Wednesday marked his fourth year as the Chairman of the House.  But the Opposition, which has suggested through the session that the Chair was biased towards the ruling party, remained unfazed. Congress chief whip Jairam Ramesh tweeted, “Presiding officers in Parliament are supposed to be neutral umpires, not partisan players. They cannot present a totally one-sided picture of goings on in the House and further aggravate the situation. Misplaced emotion leads to commotion.”  Breaking down in the House, Naidu said he spent a sleepless night on Tuesday struggling to find the provocation or reason for the Opposition forcing the House to hit a new low. He said the short duration discussion on agricultural problems and solutions was a “golden opportunity” for members protesting the farm laws to have gone on record with their positions on issues relating to the plight of the farmers. The Opposition maintains that their request was for a debate on the farm laws, not a generic one on the plight of farmers into which it was converted. As the discussion was going on, the Opposition ratcheted up the intensity of its protests; some lawmakers stormed the Well of the House shouting slogans against the government and sat on a table occupied by Rajya Sabha staff, before climbing it. “In our temples, devotees are allowed only up to the sanctum sanctorum and not beyond. Entering this sanctum sanctorum of the House in itself is an act of sacrilege and it has been happening as routine over the years…While some members sat on the Table, some others climbed on the Table of the House, perhaps to be more visible with such acts of sacrilege. I have no words to convey my anguish and to condemn such acts,” Naidu said. As the protests continued, Naidu insisted that not taking up the listed discussion on farm sector issues would send out a negative message that the House not interested in discussing the problems of India’s bread givers. “Unfortunately, it went unheeded. In the process, some sections of the House have inflicted incalculable damage to the dignity and stature of this House. As the chairman, I am deeply distressed over it and so is the nation.” He pointed out that it was worrisome that some members shot the “sad moments of sacrilege in the House” on their phones and posted it on social media. “While doing so, they only ended up showing to the people the extent to which this august House can degenerate due to the new-found competitive and aggressive disruptions by some sections,” he said. He appealed to the “collective conscience of this House” to seriously reflect on what happened and explore remedies if any. “Failure to do so would certainly render our parliamentary democracy irrelevant. I would like to remind all of you that we begin to celebrate the 75th year of our independence in a few days from now. The choice before each one of you is very clear. It is either to be the best parliamentarian or the worst disruptor.” The House was adjourned soon after his comments as the protests continued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naidu-breaks-down-over-acts-of-sacrilege-in-house-101628706153422.html
12-08-2021||India||Sharad Pawar slams ‘attack’ on women MPs in Parliament||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief and Rajya Sabha MP Sharad Pawar on Wednesday condemned the clash between the Opposition and government over the use of marshals or security personnel in Rajya Sabha during the passage of the insurance amendment Bill to privatise general insurance companies.The General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Amendment Bill, 2021, was passed with a voice vote amid tearing of papers and vociferous protest by Opposition parties.“In my 55 years of parliamentary career, I never saw the way the women MPs were attacked today (in Rajya Sabha). More than 40 men and women were brought into the House from outside. It is painful. It is an attack on democracy,” the NCP leader told reporters after the Opposition staged a walk, alleging heavy deployment of marshals to prevent their protests.Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Derek O’Brien alleged that there were more security guards than lawmakers in the Upper House, calling it an attempt by the government to “bulldoze” the insurance Bill.“RSTV will not show you that. This is censorship, the Modi-Shah Gujarat model at work in Parliament,” he posted on Twitter. The TMC leader also alleged that the government was using “gender shields” to foil MPs’ protests inside the House. “Male marshals were sent after women MPs and female marshals were posted in front of male MPs,” Brien said as some women MPs, including TMC’s Dola Sen and Congress’ Ami Yagnik, alleged manhandling by the marshals. The government, however, alleged that the marshals were attacked and pushed by the lawmakers in the Rajya Sabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pawar-slams-attack-on-women-mps-in-parliament-101628706152392.html
12-08-2021||India||A career with many firsts||An elephantine memory, a forensic ability to interpret laws and a thundering voice -- justice Rohinton Fali Nariman, a man ordained a Parsi priest at 12, will leave the Supreme Court on Thursday after seven years of judgeship.There are a number of firsts one can associate with justice Nariman. His trajectory as a lawyer and judge has indeed been out of the ordinary. In 1993, no less than the then Chief Justice of India MN Venkatachaliah amended the rules to designate him as a senior advocate at 37 against the mandatory 45. And this was just the start of a trailblazing career.Son of eminent jurist Fali S Nariman, he would walk the corridors of the Supreme Court as a one-man army, without the usual paraphernalia of a big lawyer. While every senior lawyer will have an array of juniors around them, he had none -- and said he never needed any.In 1996, he appeared for the petitioners in KR Lakshmanan vs State of Tamil Nadu, challenging a state law that sought to impose restrictions on horse racing for being a game of chance. The Supreme Court eventually ruled that horse-racing was a game of skill, and quashed the state legislation as being unconstitutional. The key takeaway was the declaration that any restriction imposed upon the fundamental rights of the citizens must be fair and reasonable, and that unreasonable intrusion into these rights will be ultra vires of the Constitution.He was later associated with Vodafone’s $2 billion tax matter; Novartis’s case on protection of its anti-cancer drug; Khoday Distilleries Ltd’s case on use of word “scot” on the premium whiskey brand Peter Scot; and Enercon’s case on law of arbitration and private international law.He was appointed Solicitor General of India in July 2011 and served till February 2013 when he resigned from the post reportedly due to difference of opinion between him and then Union law minister, Ashwani Kumar, on certain crucial cases pending before the top court.In July 2014, he was elevated to the Supreme Court as a judge, becoming only the fifth lawyer in the history to be directly appointed from the bar. The first judgment justice Nariman wrote within two months of his appointment gave a hint of the path he would follow -- a protector of rights and liberty.As part of a Constitution bench, justice Nariman gave those facing death sentences a chance to argue their review petitions in an open court instead of coming to a decision in the privacy of the judges’ chambers. Deciding a batch of petitions involving eight death row convicts in September 2014, the judgment noted that oral hearing was an indispensable facet of the right to life enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution, and hence “oral hearing, in death sentence cases, becomes too precious to be parted with”.In 2015, he authored the judgment that struck down Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, which authorised police to arrest people for social media posts construed “offensive”or “menacing”. He held that Section 66A “arbitrarily, excessively and disproportionately” invaded the right to free speech, right to dissent, right to know, and had a “chilling effect” on constitutional mandates.He later authored judgments expediting the trials in the Babri demolition case; declaring privacy as a fundamental right; striking down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalised homosexuality; holding instant triple talaq as null and void; banishing adultery as a criminal offence; introducing concept of creamy layer even for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes; and allowing women of all ages to Kerala’s Sabarimala temple.On Tuesday, in his last order, he called out lawmakers for not framing a stricter law to decriminalise politics. “The nation continues to wait, and is losing patience. Cleansing the polluted stream of politics is obviously not one of the immediate pressing concerns of the legislative branch of government,” he lamented.A man of varied interests, justice Nariman listens to Western classical music, especially Beethoven, Mozart, Wagner and Verdi. Music and musical concerts also make him travel across the globe. He likes to immerse himself in books, and has an avid interest in history, philosophy, literature and science. Justice Nariman is also a prominent scholar of Zoroastrianism and comparative religion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-career-with-many-firsts-101628705491835.html
12-08-2021||India||Himachal Pradesh: 10 dead, at least 30 trapped in landslide||Rescuers pulled out the bodies of 10 people after a landslide buried at least five vehicles, including two buses, on a road in Himachal Pradesh’s Kinnaur district on Wednesday afternoon.As night set in, operations were called off for lack of visibility, diminishing hopes of finding more survivors among the at least 30 who were still missing. At least 14 people were rescued as disaster relief personnel, locals and men from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police attempted to dig their way through to where most of the vehicles were buried.The missing included passengers of two buses that could not be reached till late evening and an unknown number of people feared to have been swept off the road and into a steep drop to a river.“Apart from the buses, three-to-four vehicles could be under the debris, which is spread over 70 to 80 metres,” said Kinnaur deputy commissioner Abid Hussain Sadiq. “The locals told us that the landslide struck so suddenly that the drivers of the vehicles did not get time to react,” he added.The incident took place struck near a village called Nigulsari on the national highway connecting state capital Shimla to Rechong Peo. Nigulsari is nestled at an altitude of roughly 5,900 ft and the highway that snakes along the mountainside is a narrow, two-lane road.Disasters due to landslides and flashfloods during the June-September monsoon season are not uncommon in the higher regions of Himalayan states, but Himachal Pradesh has this year recorded an increase in such incidents: there were 116% more landslides till the end of July this year as compared to 2020, and cloudbursts– spells of extremely heavy rain -- have gone up by 121% this monsoon, according to data provided by the state disaster management authority.A senior police official, who asked not to be named, said the vehicles had stopped on the road after debris from a smaller landslide blocked the way. The driver and the conductor of a Himachal Roadways Transport Corporation (HRTC) bus that was in the lead stepped out to look for a way through when a portion of the mountainside collapsed behind them.There was a private bus, a jeep and a few cars behind the HRTC bus, the police officer said, quoting the bus driver who survived along with the conductor. The two said there were at least 22 passengers in their bus, and another seven to eight in the other bus.Among the bodies that were pulled out were eight passengers of a utility vehicle – such vehicles are typically used as shared taxis in these areas.The official quoted above said the survivors were people who stepped out while waiting for the road to clear up, and were likely saved as they took shelter under a large rocky portion of the mountainside jutting out right above them.“Some of them managed to leave their vehicles and were running back on the narrow road when the landslide came. They found safe space below rock and boulders,” the officer said, citing eyewitnesses.An official said rescue work was treacherous amid heavy rain and the possibility that the digging machines could strike people buried in the landslide. “We had to be careful. Use of heavy machinery could have caused casualties,” said the deputy commissioner, who was among the first senior officers to reach the spot.Lahaul-Spiti and Kinnaur were the worst hit districts this season with 13 landslides and 11 flashfloods, four of them triggered by cloudburst incidents, which officials said was an unusual frequency.Earlier in the week, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said extreme rainfall events in south Asia has increased in recent past and said such events are likely to increase in high altitudes and decrease in sub-tropics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-dead-at-least-30-trapped-in-landslide-101628705372267.html
12-08-2021||India||PM Modi, Sonia Gandhi at Speaker’s meet with parties post Lok Sabha adjournment||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress president Sonia Gandhi joined other party leaders in Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla’s chamber after the acrimonious monsoon session was adjourned sine die on Tuesday. The two leaders, however, didn’t speak to each other, according to two leaders present in the meeting.“The PM and Mrs Gandhi greeted each other but avoided any conversation throughout the meeting that lasted for around 20 minutes,” said one of them, who was present in the meeting and asked not to be identified. The leaders of several parties assembled in the Speaker’s chamber to thank him for running the session after its adjournment.This was the first meeting between Modi and Gandhi in at least two years. The two leaders sat in adjacent sofas with Congress leader Adhir Chowdhury sitting right next to the PM. Gandhi didn’t attend Parliament for more than a year after the Covid-19 outbreak due to health reasons. She came to Parliament on Monday.The meeting itself was cordial, despite the acrimony witnessed during the session which was characterised by disruptions, and the government quietly pushing through its legislative agenda amid the din in the House. There were no further arguments between leaders of the Opposition and the government . The Opposition was keen on discussing and debating the Pegasus snooping controversy, the farm laws, and the fuel price rise in the House.Leaders of many opposition parties, including the Trinamool Congress, the Akali Dal, the YSRCP and the Biju Janata Dal met Birla after the session.Birla urged all of them to focus on encourage discussion and dialogue in the House in future, and said, “Discussion and dialogue will be right for the welfare of the public. We can help people fulfil deficiencies of the people.”TMC leader Sudip Bandopadhyay also took this opportunity to request the PM to send more vaccines to West Bengal, reminding Modi that Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has written three letters in this regard. Another opposition MP thanked home minister Amit Shah for personally wishing him on his birthday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-sonia-gandhi-at-speaker-s-meet-with-parties-post-lok-sabha-adjournment-101628705250671.html
12-08-2021||India||Monsoon session brought to early close amid turmoil||The monsoon session of Parliament, characterised by strident protests by the Opposition, repeated disruptions that made it among the worst sittings in terms of time, a focused and accelerated push of key laws by the government, and plain acrimony, came to a premature end on Wednesday when it was adjourned ahead of schedule.By legislation, it was a good session.The government successfully managed to introduce 15 bills and get Parliament’s approval for 20, although this meant some were passed in minutes with no one other than the minister in charge speaking.By time, it was a bad session.The Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha functioned for just 22% and 28% of their allocated time, respectively. The Lok Sabha used just 21 hours and 14 minutes of the stipulated time of 96 hours -- the lowest since the winter session of 2016, when opposition parties took on the government over demonetisation.The Rajya Sabha used 28 hours 21 minutes out of its stipulated 102 hours. In the past 10 years, the Rajya Sabha has functioned for less than 25% of its scheduled time during only six sessions.And in terms of acrimony, it was an ugly session that saw it all -- protests, disruption, suspensions and calls for “exemplary” punishment.Furious and concerted protests by the Opposition -- the session saw the rare sight of coordinated action by them -- against the Pegasus snooping controversy, the contentious farm laws passed last year, and the fuel price rise roiled Parliament.The Opposition wanted a discussion on the first with Prime Minister Narendra Modi or home minister Amit Shah in the House, but got nowhere with its demand. And when the Upper House agreed to talk farming, the Opposition pointed out, it offered a generic discussion on the plight of farmers, not a specific one on the farm laws as was sought. One member of the Rajya Sabha, from the Trinamool Congress, was suspended for the remainder of the session on July 23; on August 4, six members from opposition parties were suspended for a day; and on the penultimate day of the session, the Rajya Sabha saw among the most unruly scenes the House of Elders has likely seen.Across both Houses, there was a fragile peace only on three occasions — the passage of the Constitution amendment bill that empowers states to draw their own list of other backward classes (OBC) in both Houses and the Covid-19 debate in the Upper House.The session ended with Rajya Saba chairman Venkaiah Naidu in tears and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla ruing the fact that very little business was done.And, in the dying hours of the monsoon session in Rajya Sabha, furious protests returned once again as the government pushed the Insurance Amendment Bill even as the Opposition sought for it to be sent to a parliamentary panel.Soon after, leader of the House Piyush Goyal said the protests that saw some opposition MPs tear papers, fling files and manhandle the marshals in the House cannot be tolerated. “Just as a special committee was set up in Lok Sabha, a similar committee should be constituted to carry out investigation (into the protests on the floor of the House),” he said.Shortly before the Upper House was adjourned sine die, opposition MPs staged a walkout following a ruckus. They objected to the presence of security personnel during the passage of the insurance amendment Bill. The Opposition has been objecting to how the government has passed key bills without discussion and putting them to vote, even as the proceedings were conducted amid a din.Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge said there were more marshals than members present in the House. He alleged the marshals manhandled some of the women MPs and said women were not safe even within Parliament.The Rajya Sabha on Wednesday approved the 127th Constitution amendment bill, which was passed by the Lok Sabha on Tuesday. During the debate, Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan accused the Opposition of creating confusion among the people regarding reservation.The amendment was supported by all parties.Congress MP Abhishek Manu Singhvi asked the government the reason for not conducting a caste-based census. “We did it in 2011. Why not do it now in 2021?,” he asked, pointing out that a survey is needed because the reservation for backward classes has actually exceeded the defined limits in almost all states. He claimed that the government was hesitating to conduct a survey because it could mean in increase in reservation for OBCsto 35%.A Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam lawmaker, Tiruchi Siva, claimed the government was only pushing through the amendment “out of compulsion” and not the desire to “uphold the rights of states and Union Territories”.The Opposition sought some changes in the amendment, including an increase in the ceiling for reservation from the current 50%, but these were denied in a voice vote.The bill was unanimously approved by all 187 members of the Rajya Sabha present on Wednesday .The Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha received oral replies to only 51 questions and 66 questions, respectively. But the government replied on 98% matters raised under Rule 377 in the Lok Sabha. The standing committees presented 60 reports to the House in this session and a total of 1,243 papers were laid on the table of the House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-session-brought-to-early-close-amid-turmoil-101628705130684.html
12-08-2021||India||Delhi HC seeks Ramani’s reply on Akbar’s plea against trial court verdict||The Delhi high court (HC) on Wednesday admitted former Union minister M J Akbar’s appeal against a trial court order acquitting journalist Priya Ramani in a criminal defamation suit filed by Akbar in 2018 after Ramani accused him of sexual misconduct.Justice Mukta Gupta issued notice to Ramani on the appeal and listed it for further hearing on January 13.Appearing for Akbar, senior advocates Rajiv Nayar and Geeta Luthra contended that the trial court erroneously acquitted Ramani in spite of concluding that her allegations were defamatory in nature.In his appeal, Akbar said that the trial court had decided the case as though it was a sexual harassment case instead of a defamation case. “The impugned judgement, being based on surmises and conjecture, cannot stand muster even from a prima facie view, and therefore, is liable to be set aside,” he said.In February, a Delhi court acquitted Ramani in the defamation case stating that a woman has the right to voice her grievance even after several years.Ramani had accused Akbar of sexual misconduct over social media publishing platform Twitter in 2018 in the wake of the Me Too movement, which Akbar argued were “per se defamatory”.Referring to ancient epics ‘Mahabharata’ and ‘Ramayana’ in the judgement delivered on February 17, Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Ravindra Pandey said they were written to show the importance of dignity of a woman and it was shameful that such incidents were still happening in the country.The court accepted Ramani’s contention that Akbar was not a man of stellar reputation and said that a man’s right of reputation can’t be weighed over the right to life and dignity of a woman’s.Akbar, who was a minister in the BJP-led cabinet at the time resigned shortly after a host of women, besides Ramani, made allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment against him.On Wednesday, senior counsel Luthra contended that the trial court handed out the verdict without considering any objections raised during the trial. “Nothing is decided. The (trial) court went on to decide about Ram and Ravan. Objections are not decided or looked into,” she said.The HC judge remarked that finding any content defamatory is the “first step” in the proceedings, after which the trial court has to consider the defence of the accused. “The trial court says per se they are defamatory but in the context of which she made the allegations, there was a valid defense,” Justice Gupta stated.Niharika Karanjawala, senior associate of the Karanjawala & Co that filed Akbar’s petition in the high court, told HT: “The legal team delineated the reasons for which the appeal ought to be allowed, including the errors apparent in the record. The court was pleased to issue a notice.”In October 2018, Ramani shared an article on Twitter which she had written in 2017 in Vogue India magazine following allegations of sexual assault and misconduct against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein made by several women as part of the Me Too movement in the United States. The article did not name Akbar -- it described her experience of an interview with a newspaper editor for a reporter’s position in 1993-- but the tweet did.Akbar filed a criminal defamation suit under Section 500 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against Ramani arguing that the incident was not as she described it in her article. He also said that a tweet by Ramani describing him as a “predator” had caused irreparable damage to his reputation.On February 17 this year, the trial court acquitted Ramani. It pointed out that a woman cannot be punished for raising instances of abuse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-seeks-ramani-s-reply-on-akbar-s-plea-against-trial-court-verdict-101628704891937.html
12-08-2021||India||Supreme Court tells Centre, states to fill consumer court vacancies||States are defeating laws enacted for the benefits of people, the Supreme Court said on Wednesday as it directed the Union and state governments to fill up around 800 vacancies in consumer courts across the country within eight weeks.“This is not fair. This is unacceptable. What do you all want? That people should not get redressal under the laws...,” a bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy asked the counsel appearing for the Union and states.“Don’t create hopes when you are unwilling to fulfil aspirations. If you raise hopes that consumers will get their disputes redressed, you have to have adequate number of people to deal with the cases coming up... We can’t leave consumers and citizens to your mercy if you aren’t willing to perform,” it added.The bench has ordered that all vacancies in consumer courts at national, state and district levels be filled up by the Centre, states and Union territories in eight weeks after duly notifying the rules of appointments, advertising the posts and setting up selection committees.In a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha on July 23, the Union minister of state for consumer affairs, Ashwini Kumar Choubey, informed that there were 638 district fora functional in 28 states and 8 Union territories and all 36 state consumer commissions were operational. As of June, 25 presidents and 68 members were appointed in the state commissions whereas 367 presidents and 695 members were working in the district fora, according to the reply. The minister’s response, however, did not cite the vacancy positions.Taking umbrage at the “dilly dallying” by the Centre and states, the court directed that secretary of the consumer affairs ministry at the Centre and chief secretaries of the state governments remain present through video-conferencing on the next date of hearing if the order on filling up vacant posts is not complied with.Senior counsel Gopal Sankaranarayanan and advocate Aditya Narain, who assisted the bench as amicus curiae (friend of the court) in the case registered by it suo motu (on its own motion), produced a tabular chart showing that district consumer fora have 721 vacant posts including 188 for heads (presidents). Similarly, 72 posts were vacant across the state commissions , including 8 for presidents. The national consumer commission has three vacancies.“This is completely unacceptable. We will call chief secretaries of all states if they aren’t going to complete the job. We have given you enough time to set your house in order. You are not doing it so we will have set your house in order,” said the court while issuing the directives.The bench also pulled up the Union government not conducting a legislative impact study before it notified a new consumer protection lawin July 2020 and rehauled the entire legal regime, ranging from a wider definition of “consumer,” to enhancing the monetary jurisdiction of the consumer courts at all levels.“Once the legislative committee made these changes, what impact will it have on litigation is the study that should have been carried out. This is the irony of all legislation -- you never do legislative impact study. And now you have written to all the states asking for their views. You are doing a post-facto exercise while you should have done all this before,” the bench told additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi, who appeared for the Centre.“At least now a comprehensive legislative impact assessment must be carried out,” added the court as it gave the Union government four weeks to undertake the study and submit its report.ASG Lekhi, on his part, requested for some more time but the bench wasn’t open to this: “You are making legislation at once. If you can rush there, you can always rush here too. It is not that complex. What was a pre-requisite wasn’t done, do it now.” The court has further directed the Centre and states to file their reports on the existing infrastructure for consumer courts.The 2019 consumer protection law broadened the meaning of “consumer” allowing them to file a complaint from their place of residence; brought e-commerce platforms within the fold of the law; provided for time-bound redressal; made celebrity-endorsers also liable; and enhanced the monetary jurisdiction of consumer courts at all levels.Under the new law, a district forum can decide a consumer dispute up to ₹1 crore as against ₹20 lakh under the old law. Similarly, pecuniary jurisdiction of state commission has been enhanced from ₹1 crore to ₹10 crore, and a national commission can now decide disputes over and above ₹10 crore.Underlining the massive vacancies that existed across the consumer courts, the court said in February that a legislative impact study was a must to ascertain the volume of cases the consumer courts at different levels will be burdened with, not only now but in the foreseeable future, and the available infrastructure in the wake of the changes ushered in by the 2019 law.The suo motu case was registered on account of “inaction of the government” in appointing members of the consumer courts and providing adequate infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sctells-centre-states-to-fill-consumer-court-vacancies-101628704531331.html

Despite this, the police didn’t arrest any BJP cadre, they alleged. Trinamool Congress state unit refuted the charge of misbehaviour against them. “ We didn’t misbehave with police on August 8. All the charges are baseless. Even 12 other activists of our party were booked on false charges of causing grave injury, attempt to murder and others in the last two days at Ambassa in Dhalai district,” said TMC leader Subal Bhowmik. Bhowmik has also been booked along with Banerjee and others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/abhishek-banerjee-other-tmc-leaders-booked-for-misbehaving-with-tripura-police-101628665769558.html
12-08-2021||India||No manual scavengers in country anymore, Govt tells Parliament||There are no more manual scavengers in the country, the Centre told Parliament in writing on Tuesday, citing reports sent by various state governments.It also added, while answering a question by Communist Party of India lawmaker S Venkatesan, that voluntary organisations have claimed that the banned practice continues but they have been unable to substantiate those claims.Just last week, Union social justice minister Virendra Kumar told the Rajya Sabha that 58,098 manual scavengers were identified across the country in two separate surveys in 2013 and 2018.On Tuesday, minister of state for social justice and empowerment Ramdas Athawale reiterated that point and claimed that no deaths were reported due to manual scavenging in the last five years. He, however, said that “309 deaths have been reported during the last five years of people who undertook hazardous cleaning of sewers and septic tanks”.The government has differentiated between deaths due to manual scavenging and those that have occurred while cleaning sewers. Experts have maintained cleaning sewers and septic tanks is a mere extension of the now-banned practice of manual scavenging or the cleaning of human excreta by hand.Bezwada Wilson, the founder of Safai Karmachari Andolan, which works for sanitation workers, said the government’s denial about manual scavengers is not a new thing.“...but openly denying it in Parliament is a new pattern. As a government, they should have the courage to come up and accept that manual scavengers exist here. There is no concern about the community,” Wilson said.The government has said all identified manual scavengers have been provided one-time cash assistance of ₹40,000 as part of a scheme to rehabilitate them.Manual scavengers and their dependents are provided with a stipend of ₹3,000 during skill training and concessional loan and capital subsidy up to ₹5 lakh for self-employment projects costing up to ₹15 lakh.According to government data, 14,692 manual scavengers were given assistance in 2020-21 as compared to 13,246 in 2019-20.The data also showed that 6,204 manual scavengers were given skill development training in 2020-21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-manual-scavengers-in-india-anymore-govt-101628662829042.html

12-08-2021||Today's||Electrocution deaths: Install safe, low-cost electric fences to save elephants||In India, nearly 80 elephants die every year due to human-elephant conflict. While poaching, poisoning and train hits are known reasons for elephant deaths, we must pay close attention to death by electrocution. Since the impact of electrocution is not visible on an animal’s body, and because it is easy to remove potential evidence, including wires, posts and machines post-electrocution, even experienced veterinarians are unable to determine the exact cause of an animal’s death, and post-mortem results often declare cardiac arrest as the cause of death.When an elephant is electrocuted, we assume that the matter should be raised before the electricity department. However, except for a few cases, the department has a limited role in curtailing such incidents. One of the major causes of animal electrocution is live wire fencing by locals to protect their crops and property. They use power sources from the grid or captive sources such as a generator and/or batteries with inverters, and most of these are lethal.Also Read | Dia Mirza tweets special message on World Elephant Day, posts picGovernment data shows that electrocution kills more elephants than train accidents, poaching and poisoning. This is a nationwide problem. But it is acute in the Northeast, which is home to the second-largest population of Asian Elephant in the world. In Assam, more than 50% of the total number of elephant deaths is due to electrocution. Lethal electric fences and transmission lines from power grids are the two major causes of electrocution. The former is a single live wire pegged to bamboo or wooden posts. Lethal AC current is used, instead of the non-lethal DC current, with low ampere value. Such fences are used by people because they do not know about the fatality of such fences. We must educate and empower locals to use non-lethal means since these fences can be dangerous to humans too. Most deaths go unreported because people want to avoid subsequent legal hassles.The second cause of electrocution is sagging transmission lines in elephant habitats and areas frequented by them. This can be avoided by using insulated transmission lines. Guidelines for laying electric lines already exist; what we need is effective implementation.If we want to protect the animals and safeguard the interests of locals, it is important to install safe and low-cost electric fences. However, elephant movement paths should not be blocked while erecting fences. The idea is to replace the lethal power sources with an energizer with battery. To cut costs, a galvanised wire of 12 mm can be used at a height of about five feet so that adult elephants cannot cross.These low-cost fences cost about ₹50,000 per km— nearly five times cheaper than a conventional electric fence. With the cooperation of the local community and forest department, a six km fence in the fringe of Singlijan Reserve Forest was installed in 2015 to restrict the movement of wild elephants. There have been no HEC incidents in 30 villages under the Gohpur Circle in Biswanath district of Assam. Almost 110 km low-cost fence has been installed in various parts of Biswanath, Sonitpur, Nagaon, Golaghat, Baksa and Udalguri districts since then. The study undertaken by WWF-India revealed that well-maintained low-cost solar fences have a success rate of 80-95% in deterring elephants. But one hurdle remains. Victims of HEC – most of whom are marginalised – cannot afford ₹5 lakh to install a 10-km fence. Ensuring peaceful human-animal coexistence requires partnerships that foster local empowerment, elephant conservation, and support to enforcement agencies like the forest department. A growing number of corporate are supporting initiatives to reduce negative human-wildlife conflict. There is immense scope for them to contribute to conflict management by empowering people.Hiten Kumar Baishya is landscape Coordinator, Brahmaputra Landscape, WWF IndiaThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/electrocution-deaths-install-safe-and-low-cost-electric-fences-to-save-elephants-101628774686584.html
12-08-2021||Today's||Don’t use public interest as an additional ground to restrict free speech||In a recent decision, a division bench in the Bombay high court exercised a power that vests solely with the Parliament; it, in effect, amended the Constitution. Specifically, the judges introduced an additional restriction to the fundamental right to free speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a).The matter involved nine petitions that challenged Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) regulations in broadcasting (full disclosure — I work with broadcasters). The thrust of the petitioners’ argument was that TRAI’s economic regulations restrict the circulation of broadcaster programming, violating the broadcaster’s right to disseminate and consumer’s right to receive information, both of which are core components of the right to free speech.The Bombay high court, however, held that “public interest” serves as an additional ground on which the State may issue diktats to restrict free speech. This is problematic on three counts.Also Read | Monsoon session: India’s parliamentary democracy is in crisisFirst, the high court overstepped its jurisdiction and stepped onto turf reserved for democratically elected legislators. A primary duty of the judiciary is to interpret laws, not create them.Second, by reading in a vague notion such as public interest as a valid restriction on free speech in broadcasting, the court paved the way for greater State interference in television content, particularly news. As such, it failed to uphold the rights of citizens and operate as a check against abuses of State power.Public interest is a fluid construct in Indian legal parlance, it is not defined, and it finds mention across a host of statutes, often justifying the more non-transparent elements of governance. For instance, Section 8 of the Right to Information Act uses public interest as a ground for the State to withhold information. Article 22 of the Constitution allows authorities issuing orders regarding preventive detention to maintain confidentiality about any facts related to such orders that it considers to be against the public interest.The absence of a definition of public interest in legislation means that it falls to the judiciary to imbue it with meaning. However, courts tend to test public interest on a case by case basis. In Central Public Information Officer, Supreme Court Of India v Subhash Chandra Agarwal, related to RTI requests made to courts on the collegium process, judges’ asset declarations, and judicial elevations, the court held that information officers must determine what constitutes public interest. In addition, it reemphasised and cherrypicked wide statutory grounds for the State to withhold information from the public, including breach of confidentiality and fiduciary responsibilities. What follows is that the concept of public interest is often employed to protect the interests of powerful individuals and institutions.Third, the Bombay high court did not adhere to the judicial precedent on the matter of reading public interest as an implicit restriction on free speech. The Supreme Court has remained mindful of the political dimensions of public interest and what might result if it allowed the State to restrict free speech on this ground. While the right to free speech in India is not absolute and comes with certain riders expressly listed under Article 19(2) of the Constitution, public interest never operated as a legitimate restriction on it. Article 19(2) does not mention it and the courts do not permit its entry as an implicit restriction on Article 19(1)(a).In Indian Express Newspapers vs. Union of India, for instance, the Supreme Court observed that the framers of the Constitution purposefully omitted public interest from 19(2) to ensure that the State did not hold the right to free speech ransom when it wished to impose excessive burdens on the press.Rather than make a rational decision guided by constitutional principles, in this case, the Bombay high court, with due respect, usurped the jurisdiction of the legislature, failed to uphold press freedom on television, and disregarded for the precedent set down by higher courts. The order merits wider discussion and a review.Vivan Sharan is Partner, Koan Advisory GroupThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/dont-use-public-interest-as-an-additional-ground-to-restrict-free-speech-101628762434235.html
12-08-2021||Today's||1971: When Delhi and Moscow came together||On August 9, 1971, the Indo-Soviet Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation was signed in New Delhi by the foreign ministers of both countries, Swaran Singh and Andrei Gromyko. The treaty was probably the most seminal foreign policy arrangement entered into by India in the 20th century. It undoubtedly had the most profound effect on the politics and geography of South Asia, cementing what many thought was the pre-eminence of India in the region.Given the tensions over East Pakistan in 1971 and the creation of Bangladesh by the end of that year, it is not surprising that many believe that India was primarily driven to sign the treaty by this crisis. But that is a superficial picture, countered through some superb research by Srinath Raghavan in his book 1971: A Global History of the Creation of Bangladesh. When supplemented with a reading of the relevant portions of Jairam Ramesh’s excellent book, Intertwined Lives: PN Haksar and Indira Gandhi, it should provide a comprehensive understanding of how the treaty came to be signed.Also Read | A manifesto for India at 75As Raghavan notes: “The treaty was not the product of a strategic consensus between India and the Soviet Union on the crisis in South Asia. For New Delhi and Moscow sought rather different objectives in concluding the treaty.” Discussions on the treaty had started a couple of years before it was signed, in 1969 to be precise. A draft was quickly agreed upon once India’s concerns about maintaining its non-alignment and omitting any explicit references to military cooperation were accommodated. In fact, according to Raghavan, the Indian draft of the treaty did not significantly differ from the Russian version.However, the then Prime Minister (PM), Indira Gandhi, while positive about the treaty, was hesitant to sign it too quickly. She was worried about internal political opposition to the treaty as well as possible negative reactions abroad, primarily in the United States (US) and China. The fact that she got embroiled in a conflict with the Congress party leadership in 1969, and elections were held subsequently, helped postpone the signing.Even in the middle of the East Pakistan crisis, Indira Gandhi remained ambivalent about signing the document. But then US secretary of state Henry Kissinger’s secret visit to China (via Pakistan) in July 1971, and his subsequent conversation with the Indian ambassador to the US, LK Jha, on July 17 tipped the balance. Kissinger told Jha that the US would not get involved if China intervened in a war between India and Pakistan.Alarm bells rang in Delhi. PM Gandhi shed her hesitations and authorised Indian officials to proceed with the treaty. Thus, the treaty was signed on August 9, exactly one month after Kissinger’s Beijing visit.Expectedly, it was duly castigated by most Indian political parties, barring probably only the pro-Moscow Communist Party of India, then led by SA Dange. The then Jana Sangh leader, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, for instance, called it “a Soviet stab in the Indian back”. The treaty was roundly — and expectedly — criticised by most Western states.A study of publicly available material makes it abundantly clear that Russia’s prime motivation in seeking the treaty with India was China and the same was true for India. The Soviets proposed the treaty soon after the eruption of their Ussuri river border clashes with China in March 1969. The draft was, barring some minor later changes, ready by September/October 1970, long before the East Pakistan crisis erupted in March 1971.In a way, Bangladesh was a collateral beneficiary of the treaty because it prevented external great power interference in the East Pakistan crisis.Fifty years later, the world has changed dramatically. The Soviet Union no longer exists. China is not a weaker adversary of Russia seeking to ride on US coat tails — indeed, it is quite the opposite. India and South Asia have evolved significantly. The US, still the pre-eminent world power, is now locked in competition with China, which doesn’t seek to hide its muscles anymore and aggressively projects and displays power. India and Russia — the successor to the Soviet Union — are moving in apparently different orbits.But the more some things change, the more others stay the same. India is still concerned with China — this time with its belligerent rise. In response, India is moving closer to the US. However, Russia is moving closer to China trying to counter a belligerent US.This undoubtedly introduces significant tensions in the Indo-Russian relationship. But neither India nor Russia wants to be a junior partner to any other power yet. Both recognise that to stay relevant in a world that could slowly move towards bipolarity, they will need to keep their ties strong and build independently strong relationships with other middle powers.Building stronger ties requires identifying areas of convergence and prioritising them over the divergences. Strong, even if limited, ties require buy-in from political, bureaucratic, military, business, cultural and intellectual elites. This would hugely assist the efforts of both countries to move towards becoming knowledge economies, prepared for the rest of the 21st century and beyond.But, like anywhere else in the world, there are conflicting views within the elites. Currently, the more vocal elites in both countries are those that would like to see India and Russia drift apart from each other. Fortunately, so far, these voices do not accurately reflect the elite equations at the decision-making level.The strategic convergence of 1971 continues to have abiding lessons, 50 years later.Nandan Unnikrishnan is distinguished fellow, Observer Research FoundationThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/1971-when-delhi-and-moscow-came-together-101628761894276.html
12-08-2021||Today's||A manifesto for India at 75||As India enters its 75th year of independence, it is a fitting time to unveil a dream of a better India.An India where harmony prevails over hate, where those who target any citizen for their religion, caste, community, region, are prosecuted and convicted for hate speech. Hate cannot be “normalised” in any manner, neither can the culture of impunity. A modern progressive society must have no place for exploiting historical scars to settle scores in the present. Just throw all those who engage in hate speech across communities into the same jail cell and toss away the keys.An India where opaque governments do not try and hide Covid deaths, where data is not falsified to create a fake perception that “all is well”. Why should a citizen’s death certificate be fudged? Callous in life, do we have to be insensitive in death too? If shortage of oxygen led to loss of lives, admit it rather than try and hide behind medico-legal jargon. And when bodies are found floating down a river, don’t engage in a perfidious cover-up by refusing to even acknowledge the scale of death and despair.Also Read | Monsoon session: India’s parliamentary democracy is in crisisAn India where access to quality health care is not determined by social and economic status. Where a public health system puts the aam aadmi above VVIP privilege to ensure that no one is denied a hospital bed in an emergency. Where we build more hospitals than places of worship, where doctors and not self-styled Godmen are seen as true icons of devotion and compassion.An India where we lessen divides and not widen inequalities. Where poverty alleviation is seen as the greatest service to humanity. Where, when a lockdown leads to mass migration of daily wage labour, governments address the crisis. Where the gaping digital divide in pandemic times needs to be addressed effectively. Where a lack of a smartphone or varying levels of technological literacy must not become barriers to education.An India where Parliament is the ultimate symbol of democratic values of debate and dialogue, not of unilateralism, obstructionism and rowdyism. Parliament cannot be a Big Boss house where decisions are bulldozed by a brute majority, nor can it become an arena for stalling key legislation. Parliamentary democracy cannot be reduced to a once in five year voting ritual that disconnects the elected representative from the citizen.An India where governments accused of snooping and violating the right to privacy of their citizens are subject to institutional scrutiny. Where a free and open society must ensure that those who threaten their much cherished democratic freedoms are probed and censured. Where those who are ideological opponents of the government are not labelled “anti-national”, and where, instead, true patriotism is recognised as sustained interrogation of any abuse of power. Where a colonial-era law such as sedition is struck the statute books and dissent is not criminalised.An India which respects its federal pulls and pressures and where states are not divided based on party affiliations. Where local antagonisms do not spill over into a violent conflict, where the nation’s peripheries matter as much as the heartland. Where constitutional authorities retain their autonomy and integrity. Where the Election Commission acts as a neutral umpire. Where enforcement agencies are not misused to settle political scores and where judges are not compromised by a domineering executive.An India where our economic policymakers snap out of denial mode. Where the true state of the economy isn’t determined by a rising sensex or fanciful V shaped graphics but by the reality of falling incomes and loss of jobs. Where a shattered informal sector and distressed micro and small industries become the bedrock of policy initiatives and not fat-cat crony corporates who have little to lose. Where protesting farmers are not “enemies” of the State, barricaded behind iron nails and barbed wires, but are sons of the soil who deserve a fair hearing.An India where a woman isn’t assaulted every 15 minutes, where convictions in such crimes are swift and assured. Where the family of the victim doesn’t have to wait for years for court decisions, where witnesses are not intimidated into changing their testimony, where a woman’s dignity is not compromised by typical misogynistic attitudes.An India where local tribal groups are not denied their rights to land, forests and livelihood, where those who stand up for the rights of the poor and marginalized are not labelled as “urban Naxals”. Where when an octogenarian priest is arrested, his lifelong commitment to tribal rights is not demonised as terrorist activity with scant evidence.An India which recognises the climate crisis as arguably the biggest challenge of the next century. Where policymakers address the ecological crisis caused by reckless deforestation and coastal encroachments. Where air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions are not seen as elite preoccupations but become part of an ever-widening dialogue on global warming and the right to breathe clean air.An India that becomes an Olympic super-power and not just a cricket-obsessed country. Where it isn’t another 13 years before India wins its next Olympic gold. Where even as we celebrate our Olympic stars, we remember that only a country with a genuine sports culture will win medals consistently. And yes, an India where next time the champion athletes are felicitated, their images are larger than those of political leaders.Postscript: The dream is not just for a better India but a better media too, one which puts sense above sensation and news above noise and speaks truth to power rather than bend before it.

12-08-2021||Today's||Monsoon session: India’s parliamentary democracy is in crisis||The normalisation of disruption and the steamrolling of legislation in the monsoon session are warning signs that parliamentary functioning needs an urgent overhaul. If this pattern continues, the new Parliament building will be a modern and spacious venue for a dysfunctional institution.Political disagreement on discussing issues such as the alleged Pegasus phone hacking and farm laws led to the washout of the session. There was only one exception. The ruling party and the Opposition reached a rare consensus on a constitutional amendment bill, which clarifies that states can maintain their list of socially and educationally backward classes. But the debate on the amendment was an aberration in the larger story of how Parliament passed laws during the session.The two Houses went through the motions while passing 15 other laws. Amid continuing disruptions, Lok Sabha, on an average, took less than 10 minutes to pass a law, and Rajya Sabha passed each law in less than half an hour. The passage of these laws was more in form than in substance. In Lok Sabha, there were 13 bills in which no Member of Parliament (MP) spoke other than the minister in charge of the bill.The political debate in the two Houses on a law is often in addition to a careful examination of the government’s legislative proposal by a parliamentary committee. And this aspect of legislative scrutiny continued to weaken in the monsoon session. The government introduced 11 bills in the session and pushed them through Parliament without scrutiny by standing committees. Only 12% of the government’s legal proposals have been sent to committees for scrutiny in the current Lok Sabha. This number was 27% in the 16th (2014-19), 71% in the 15th (2009-14) and 60% in the 14th (2004- 09) Lok Sabha.Amid the slogan shouting and the raising of placards, the government accomplished almost all of its legislative agenda. The one significant piece of law that it did not bring before Parliament was an amendment to delicense electricity distribution. The government also brought in a law to end retrospective taxation and another one to increase private sector participation in public sector insurance companies.A casualty of parliamentary disruption was the ability of the Opposition to hold the government accountable for its functioning. With Question House barely operational, ministers neither had to orally answer questions nor face pointed follow-ups on the work done by their ministries. MPs were able to get written answers from the government on various issues, including the handling of the Covid-19 situation, the vaccination drive, and deaths due to the pandemic. While Rajya Sabha was able to deliberate on the pandemic, in the Lok Sabha, no such discussion could occur due to disruptions.Finally, this is the fourth consecutive session that has been cut short. The pandemic led to the curtailment of two sessions in 2020. This year, political parties agreed to end the budget session 11 days ahead of schedule to campaign in state elections. The monsoon session is yet another reminder that the institution needs to rethink how it deals with disruptions. It does not have any effective mechanism to reign in political parties for the conduct of their MPs. And since MPs disrupt Parliament on the instruction of their political parties, disciplining them hasn’t worked.Parliament can change its rules to give MPs more teeth in questioning the government and empower its committees to become critical stakeholders in the law-making process. This will increase the stake that MPs have in the effective functioning of the institution, and disincentivise them from disrupting it. But this alone will not stop parliamentary disruptions.The socialist leader and former minister, Madhu Dandavate, once remarked that a sense of accommodation by the treasury benches and a sense of responsibility by the Opposition benches is the balance essential for the smooth running of Parliament. And this balance can only be achieved by both sides working together to uphold the dignity of Parliament.Chakshu Roy is the head of legislative and civic engagement, PRS Legislative Research The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-monsoon-session-highlights-the-crisis-india-s-parliamentary-democracy-101628693611299.html
12-08-2021||Editorials||The story of local successes in water management||Clean water and sanitation, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been rightly focused on, including through the Jal Jeevan Mission, has enormous impact on both health, economy, gender equality and education. While Indore, Surat and Puri are outliers at the moment, they can provide a road map and encouragement for others to follow suit.Indore in Madhya Pradesh was declared the first “water plus” city in the country under the Swachh Survekshan 2021, according to an announcement by the Centre. Surat in Gujarat has also received the same tag, which is provided to a city for maintaining cleanliness in rivers and drains under its administration. According to protocol provided by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, a city can be declared as “water plus” if it achieves three parameters: First, it must ensure that the dirty water from the city does not go into any river or drain; second, all public toilets must be connected to sewer lines and must be cleaned; and third, 30% of the city’s sewer water has to be recycled and reused. Earlier this month, another city, Puri (Odisha), achieved an important milestone: It became the first city to provide residents drink-from-tap facility, which means they can use water for cooking and drinking without filtration.In India, accessibility to clean water and water pollution are two big challenges. Less than 50% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water. Water pollution is a serious problem as almost 70% of its surface water resources and a growing percentage of its groundwater reserves are contaminated by biological, toxic, organic, and inorganic pollutants, says an IDFC report.Clean water and sanitation, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been rightly focused on, including through the Jal Jeevan Mission, has enormous impact on both health, economy, gender equality and education. While Indore, Surat and Puri are outliers at the moment, they can provide a road map and encouragement for others to follow suit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-story-of-local-successes-in-water-management-101628778351891.html
12-08-2021||Editorials||The outcome of the Monsoon Session||The monsoon session of Parliament has ended, cut short by the continued standoff between the treasury and Opposition benches. There were three broad political takeaways from the session. One, India’s Parliament, and, by extension Indian democracy, is in crisis. The session saw disruptions on each day; unilateral passage of legislations; unprecedented scenes of Opposition Members of Parliament (MPs) snatching papers, throwing the rule book at the Chair, and sitting on the secretariat table; suspension of seven MPs; and, depending on who you believe, an assault on a woman marshal, or the use of marshals against the Opposition with women MPs alleging they were attacked. As Chakshu Roy pointed out in this newspaper, the Lok Sabha took an average of ten minutes and Rajya Sabha an average of half an hour to pass laws. Despite the almost unanimous demand of the Opposition, the government refused to send a bill which would enable the privatisation of general insurance companies to a select committee — unsurprising given that only 11% of the bills in the three years of the 17th Lok Sabha have gone to parliamentary committees. All of this indicates that Parliament is neither fulfilling its function of deliberative lawmaking nor of holding the executive accountable.Two, the session marked the return of caste as the fundamental fault line in Indian politics. With the unanimous passage of a constitutional amendment to restore the power of states to draw their own list of backward classes, and the overwhelming demand for both a caste census and a provision to allow reservations to exceed the 50% ceiling imposed by the Supreme Court, it is clear that the medium-term future of politics lies in the management of identity politics. The government will focus on the enhanced representation of Other Backward Classes and highlight its commitment to reservations to sustain its electoral coalition. The Opposition will seek to fracture the government’s multi-caste alliance by raising demands which are sure to upset the latter’s upper caste base. Instead of moving towards a political imagination which makes individual citizens with rights and universal justice key principles, India is descending further into the morass of group identity-based politics.And finally, the Opposition in Parliament indicates that despite differences over leadership and alliances, there is a fundamental convergence across regional parties and the Congress about the need to battle the Bharatiya Janata Party. In the House, the political class was already fighting the 2022 Uttar Pradesh and 2024 general elections and trying to send signals to their respective constituencies. This polarisation is set to deepen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-outcome-of-the-monsoon-session-101628771734724.html
12-08-2021||Editorials||A new Afghan war||Afghanistan’s civil war is having a tangible impact on India. After drawing down its diplomatic presence from consulates in Herat, Jalalabad and Kandahar, India evacuated personnel from its consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif on Wednesday. It also issued an advisory to all Indian citizens to return home, and Indian companies to withdraw their employees from project sites. India’s move comes in the wake of the Taliban’s capture of key provincial capitals and border posts. The Afghan government is putting up a resistance and has no intention of letting Kabul fall — but is constrained by depleted international support and a sham of a United States (US)-engineered peace process, which legitimised the Taliban without the group giving up violence.There are many moving parts to the fluid situation in Afghanistan. While there is little domestic appetite in the US to stay on militarily, the Taliban’s relative success has generated criticism against US special envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, for appeasing the militant group. A forcible Taliban takeover will force the US to make some hard choices. Iran is talking to the Taliban but is uncomfortable with its aggression in the north, and has more in common with India than publicly perceived. There are voices in Pakistan which point to how the obsession with the idea of gaining “strategic depth” in Afghanistan through the Taliban could well lead to further instability. But despite this, with Pakistan, China and Russia broadly on board, and the US in exit mode, the Taliban believes that it can change the facts on the ground enough to be able to exercise political dominance.India was acutely aware of the Taliban’s intentions, capabilities and how it would use the peace process. It was also aware of Pakistan’s game of pretending to be a responsible peacemaker while sponsoring terror. But India’s leverage was limited and Delhi could not really tell Washington to continue fighting — even though there is a legitimate debate on whether India could have reached out to the Taliban early enough to secure its own interests. India’s preference is for a stable, democratic and inclusive Afghan government which has a balanced foreign policy. But this is unlikely to happen. The war will persist and there will be instability. Whether this instability remains confined within Afghanistan’s border or spills over into Iran, Central Asia, Pakistan itself or Kashmir, or all of the above, is to be seen. India has a limited role, but must continue to support the Afghan government in this war while engaging with all relevant actors to secure its interests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-new-afghan-war-101628693314076.html
12-08-2021||Editorials||The climate crisis threatens Indian agriculture and livelihoods||The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, released on Monday, has highlighted the stark reality of global warming and its dire consequences — altered rainfall patterns, rising seas and temperatures, deadlier heat waves and glacial melts. The findings have serious implications for India and its political economy, particularly agriculture, which continues to be the largest source of livelihood.India is already facing water stress, thanks to erratic monsoons, falling water table, and use of water-intensive hybrid seeds, and the rise in temperatures has made agriculture hungry for more resources such as water. According to an ongoing study of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, farming now consumes over 30% more water due to “high evaporative demand and crop duration due to forced maturity”. This will intensify. Increased temperatures and extreme rainfall can also affect soil fertility, increase incidence of pest infestation, and also impact allied sectors such as animal husbandry and fisheries. Higher temperatures also hamper productivity for outdoor workers such as farmers and labourers. The 2017-18 Economic Survey found that the climate crisis could cut farm incomes by up to 15% to 18%, and up to 20% in areas without irrigation. Nearly 60% of India’s net sown area isn’t irrigated.India must work on a war-footing to mitigate the dire consequences of the climate crisis that could push millions into poverty, and also lead to food insecurity and under-nutrition. According to an Observer Research Foundation study, India must step up public investment in development and dissemination of crop varieties that are more tolerant of temperature and precipitation fluctuations, and are more water- and nutrient-efficient. Agricultural policy should focus on improving crop productivity, water management, and developing safety nets for farmers to cope with the risks of the climate crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-climate-crisis-threatens-indian-agriculture-and-livelihoods-101628692471824.html
